      "bodyText": "This week highlighted a number of massive problems we have in this country. The most obvious of course is the horrendous intrusions on freedom of the press. But a close second is the revelation about how poorly we debate and treat issues of the economy and climate change. Everything you need to know about how we rate the importance of climate change is how the latest economic national accounts and greenhouse gas emissions data were released. On Wednesday at 11:30am EST precisely, the Australian Bureau of Statistics released the national accounts, detailing the entire production within Australia\u2019s economy during the first three months of 2019. On Thursday at no set time \u2013 but six days after it was required by Senate order \u2013 and after the headline figures had been given to the Australian for soft coverage, the government released the inventory for Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions during the last three months of 2018. Let\u2019s be honest, the way these figures were released is perfectly in keeping with the contempt our prime minister and his government regard action on climate change. For him the climate crisis is just an opportunity to say some soft soap marketing spin when out among the people or in front of microphones and to then reveal what he really thinks by appointing Angus Taylor as minister for \u201cemissions reduction\u201d. It was no shock to anyone that our emissions are rising. They have been rising ever since the carbon price was removed \u2013 marking the LNP\u2019s \u201cemissions reduction fund\u201d as a phrase of mendacity. Any suggestion that the LNP cares about reducing emissions is a lie. They don\u2019t, they never have, and they never will until forced to do so by voters. After this election they will feel no such compulsion. And so the lies and spin will continue, whether it be in the renaming of ministerial titles or the releasing of emissions data when it best suits \u2013 such as the day after the State of Origin and while the media is focussed on AFP raids on the ABC and News Corp. This is not news; it is abundantly clear that the LNP was re-elected off the back of a fistful of lies. There was of course the big lie about death taxes, but underneath it all was the foundation lie of the campaign \u2013 that Australia\u2019s economy is strong. It is not \u2013 it is as weak now as it has been any time since the GFC. The foundation was set before the election began when Scott Morrison suggested that: \u201cWe have a plan that has been keeping our economy strong\u201d. The economy is not strong; they didn\u2019t have a plan. Just how lacking in strength is our economy? In the past year the economy grew more slowly than it has for a decade. All that is keeping us out of a recession is population growth, as the past three quarters have seen GDP per capita decline in seasonally adjusted terms. When did that last occur? Try 1983. Household disposable incomes since 1959 have grown on average by 3.2% in real terms, but in the past three years they have grown on average by just 0.9% \u2013 the worst growth since 1988. On a per capita basis, household living standards are below not just what they were at the 2016 election, but also when the LNP came to power at the 2013 election. None of this is at all surprising to anyone who was paying attention. But for far too long the media and in turn voters have swallowed the line that the budget surplus or deficit is the indicator of anything remotely close to economic management. We spend too much time obsessing about the budget and GDP growth and too little time obsessing about household living standards. We spend too much time concentrating on unemployment and too little time on underutilisation \u2013 which is higher now than when the LNP won office in 2013. We have a government that produced a budget which forecast a budget surplus in the next financial year and which allowed them to go to an election suggesting that was the defining economic measure by which it should be judged. And it worked. And now, three weeks after the election, the Reserve Bank has cut rates to record lows because the economy is stuttering to a halt. It is time for action, and yet the treasurer Josh Frydenberg\u2019s performance at the press conference announcing the figures does not fill one with confidence. Rather than a man with the details of our nearly $2tn economy at his fingertips, he comes across more like a small-town accountant who, after reviewing your work expenses, pauses uncomfortably too long before telling you he thinks they might be tax deductible. A week like this brings into very sharp relief the importance of elections.

But given the complicated machinations of a six-pool World Cup, final group stage positions could prove critical, especially with a potentially stacked top half of the draw come the knock out stages.</p> <p>Should the group favourites prevail, heavyweights France and USA could be on a quarter final collision course, with England also lurking. Australia would fancy their chances on the other side of the draw, where likely opponents could include a third-placed finisher and perhaps Canada or Japan.</p> <p>There are too many permutations to set much store in crystal ball gazing at this stage, but suffice to say, if the Matildas want to go deep into the tournament, finishing top of Group C could be essential.</p> <p>For that to happen, much will depend upon the opening group stage game against Italy, which looms as a potential banana skin fixture. The Italians are expected to be defensively resolute, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/31/womens-world-cup-2019-team-guide-no-10-italy?CMP=share_btn_tw\">but with 22/23 of their squad based domestically</a> and few with experience outside of Italy they lack the international exposure of the Matildas.</p> <p>Australia are expected to be without the services of youngster Mary Fowler who is awaiting scans on a hamstring strain, and while Milicic told media on Saturday that Kellond-Knight was available for selection, the key defensive midfielder could be well-short of match fitness.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Milicic has emphasised the importance of squad depth if the Matildas are to go deep into the tournament; prioritising minutes for all his outfield players so that starting XI stars can remain fresh come knockout stages.</p> <p>There\u2019s certainly an abundance of talent and experience within the group \u2013 and the squad is coming into France 2019 at an excellent age.</p> <p>Realistically though, Australia remain dark horses. The nations that have laid claim to the status of World No 1 (for the fifteen years since Fifa\u2019s women\u2019s ratings existed) \u2013 USA and Germany \u2013 go in as tournament favourites, as do hosts France, who are the only team to have beaten the US in the past two years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/france-women-south-korea-world-cup-match-report\">France off to a flying start after sweeping South Korea aside</a> </p> </aside>  <p>England, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan also loom, depending on how the draw plays out.

It\u2019s been an eventful four years since the World Cup in Canada, starting with the Matildas\u2019 historic 2015 pay-strike, which saw them withdraw from a high-profile friendly series against the USA. A bruising two-year back-and-forth with Football Federation Australia followed, before a landmark collective bargaining agreement was announced in 2017. Though the off-field distractions appeared to be over the biggest hand grenade was yet to land, with the bungled sacking of coach Alen Stajcic sending one of Australia\u2019s most-loved teams off to France under a pall of accusation and counter-accusation. This playing group is therefore battle-hardened to off-field distractions. Even the announcement this week that the Matildas would lead a global pay dispute over the discrepancy between Fifa\u2019s prize money for men\u2019s and women\u2019s football appears to come as little diversion to the squad, whose focus naturally remains on the pitch. For key defender Alanna Kennedy, there\u2019s a sense of unfinished business from Canada 2015, where an 87th minute goal to Japan\u2019s Mana Iwabuchi saw the Matildas tumble out at the quarter-finals stage for a third consecutive World Cup. \u201cWe felt as though we had another step in us,\u201d Kennedy told Guardian Australia earlier this week. \u201cFour years later I feel there\u2019s an expectation from us that we want to be in the semi-finals or final.\u201d The big challenge for the Matildas, new coach or not, is that women\u2019s football around them has been improving exponentially. At the 2011 World Cup there were two or three standout nations, in 2015 that expanded to five or six. Heading into France 2019 as many as eight or nine nations could be genuine contenders.

The mood from inside the camp appears to suggest that the team is in a better place under Ante Milicic, after a period of one or two years in which performances stagnated. \u201cUnder Staj we had a very predictable style of play, we pretty much didn\u2019t really have a solution when teams had worked us out,\u201d Elise Kellond-Knight told Guardian Australia. \u201cThey knew how to high-press us, and stopped us playing out, whereas under Ante we\u2019ve now worked on a couple of styles where we are able to play out of extreme high pressure.\u201d Tactically, there\u2019s a sense the Matildas are more sophisticated \u2013 the ability with which they posed serious questions of the world\u2019s No 1 team a few months ago demonstrated this. Conversely, while further evolutions were present against the Dutch in Eindhoven, eight goals conceded in consecutive friendlies against key rivals suggests there are very real defensive frailties within this Matildas team \u2013 not aided by the withdrawal through injury of experience defender Laura Alleway. With as many as three teams going through from each pool, a group-stage exit appears unlikely for the Matildas. But given the complicated machinations of a six-pool World Cup, final group stage positions could prove critical, especially with a potentially stacked top half of the draw come the knock out stages. Should the group favourites prevail, heavyweights France and USA could be on a quarter final collision course, with England also lurking. Australia would fancy their chances on the other side of the draw, where likely opponents could include a third-placed finisher and perhaps Canada or Japan. There are too many permutations to set much store in crystal ball gazing at this stage, but suffice to say, if the Matildas want to go deep into the tournament, finishing top of Group C could be essential. For that to happen, much will depend upon the opening group stage game against Italy, which looms as a potential banana skin fixture. The Italians are expected to be defensively resolute, but with 22/23 of their squad based domestically and few with experience outside of Italy they lack the international exposure of the Matildas. Australia are expected to be without the services of youngster Mary Fowler who is awaiting scans on a hamstring strain, and while Milicic told media on Saturday that Kellond-Knight was available for selection, the key defensive midfielder could be well-short of match fitness. Nevertheless, Milicic has emphasised the importance of squad depth if the Matildas are to go deep into the tournament; prioritising minutes for all his outfield players so that starting XI stars can remain fresh come knockout stages. There\u2019s certainly an abundance of talent and experience within the group \u2013 and the squad is coming into France 2019 at an excellent age. Realistically though, Australia remain dark horses. The nations that have laid claim to the status of World No 1 (for the fifteen years since Fifa\u2019s women\u2019s ratings existed) \u2013 USA and Germany \u2013 go in as tournament favourites, as do hosts France, who are the only team to have beaten the US in the past two years. England, the Netherlands, Canada and Japan also loom, depending on how the draw plays out. For Australia, it will take a good start against Italy and for talismanic striker Sam Kerr to fire. Nevertheless, for a tight-knit group of women that has endured so much on and off the field together \u2013 there\u2019s a sense that France 2019 could be Australia\u2019s best ever chance at winning a World Cup. \u201cIn my mind, definitely [it\u2019s now or never]\u201d, says Kellond-Knight. \u201cI think the last six years of work has really prepared us for this moment \u2013 if it\u2019s going to come together, it\u2019s going to be at this World Cup.\u201d",

Mark Sahady is the principal organizer, under the moniker Super Happy Fun America. He has previously organized and attended events, some of which have turned violent, as the leader of the Boston chapter of a group called Resist Marxism. The Daily Beast described the new organization as a \u201cfront for [the] far-right group\u201d. Events organized by Sahady in Boston have often been small, with attendees vastly outnumbered by opposing groups. In the immediate aftermath of the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, during which a counter-protester was killed, a Free Speech Rally in Boston saw attendees outnumbered by tens of thousands of opponents. A Rally for the Republic was similarly small-scale, as was a counter-protest to a pro-gun control March for Our Lives event. In 2018, Think Progress reported that Resist Marxism had links with white nationalist groups, and that members had expressed antisemitic sentiments in leaked chats. Among the events Sahady has traveled to nationwide in recent years was a June 2018 event in Portland, Oregon, that was organized by Patriot Prayer leader Joey Gibson and which degenerated into extreme violence, declared a riot by Portland police. Resist Marxism was founded by Kyle Chapman, better known as \u201cBased Stickman\u201d since footage of him brawling with antifascists in Berkeley \u2013 complete with armor and a club \u2013 made him a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre on the far right in 2017.

Order now and watch them melt down! #StraightPrideParade.\u201d Chapman has also inflated several white nationalist talking points, claiming \u201cwhite genocide is in full swing in South Africa\u201d and decrying Florida laws against antisemitic discrimination, writing: \u201cAntisemitism laws are cropping up all over the country. Most of you cucks are afraid of saying anything for fear of being called antisemitic.\u201d Boston\u2019s mayor, Marty Walsh, said no permit had yet been issued for the Straight Pride Parade but wrote on Twitter: \u201cPermits to host a public event are granted based on operational feasibility, not based on values or endorsements of beliefs.\u201d Walsh added: \u201cThe city of Boston cannot deny a permit based on an organization\u2019s values.\u201d Parade organizers announced that Yiannopoulos would act as the \u201cmascot and Grand Marshall\u201d. Yiannopoulos \u2013 exiled from US conservative circles after comments about pedophilia, widely banned from social media and revealed last year by the Guardian to be in deep debt \u2013 has begun promoting the event on his own Telegram channel. Yiannopoulos, who is gay, wrote: \u201cCan\u2019t wait to see you Boston, it\u2019s great to be straight.\u201d Organizers of the straight pride parade did not immediately respond to requests for comment. David Neiwert, author of Alt America and a longtime observer of the US far right, believes the march is primarily opportunistic. For the Daily Kos, he described Sahady as a \u201cstreet brawler\u201d with \u201ca history \u2026 of organizing violent events\u201d. Neiwert told the Guardian: \u201cWhat we know about these street-fighting gangs is that they latch on to whatever they can in order to go out and fight with the left.\u201d He added: \u201cIn this case it\u2019s so utterly juvenile that it\u2019s like a sixth-grade taunt.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Read Kieran Pender\u2019s match report from Reims: Let\u2019s recap the rest of the day two action: That was relatively plain-sailing from start to finish. Norway take victory from their Group A opener, moving level on points with hosts France, who sit top of the pile having found a fourth against Korea. The goalscorers Utland and Reiten were very influential for the Norwegians, particularly in a first-half blitz which brought all three goals, while the Nigeria goalkeeper Oluehi had a torrid time. 90+2 min: Oshoala carves out another opening for Nigeria, surging down the right flank before checking in at the byline. But Norway stand firm, with Minde and Thorisdottir stepping in to clean up. 90 min: There will be six added minutes. Reiten is withdrawn for Haavi, as Norway make their third and final change of the evening. 89 min: Reiten runs into a Nigeria roadblock and requires a bit of treatment as a result. The time is ticking away. Norway are almost there. 87 min: Graham hits it from 25 yards \u2013 but it is wayward. 85 min: Thorsnes makes a superb, strong challenge to steal back possession just inside the Norway half. That is the catalyst for a swift upfield move, with Norway earning a free-kick soon after. Reiten and Graham are stood over it ... 83 min: Graham goes on a mazy run for Norway, bouncing off four or five Nigeria defenders before letting fly inside the box. It is a relatively tame strike but it is enough to cause problems for the unconvincing Oluehi, who spills the ball, allowing it to slip through her fingers. Fortunately for Nigeria, the ball drops to safety, the wrong side of the post as far as Norway are concerned. 82 min: Thorsnes has her first sighting of goal \u2013 but the Norway substitute fails to trouble the Nigeria goalkeeper. It was a slick move upfield by the Scandinavians, with the ball being swept in from the right flank. 79 min: Norway make their first change. Elise Thorsnes, the striker, replaces Utland in a like-for-like swap. Utland, who opened the scoring, is all smiles, high-fiving each member of the bench as he trods along the dugout. 75 min: Terrific arcing ball over the top of the Norway defence by Chikwelu \u2013 but Kanu, the substitute, cannot latch on to it. It was a wondrous pass but, in the end, that was about it, with Hjelmseth storming out of goal to greet the Nigeria forward. Nice idea. 72 min: Michael Essien, the former Ghana and Chelsea midfielder, is among those in the stands watching on. He is playing his football in Azerbaijan these days. There has not been too much to get excited about this second half. Norway are cruising. 70 min: Ordega rounds Hjelmseth \u2013 but the striker cannot apply the finish! Another chance goes begging. Meanwhile Kanu is on for the captain Oparanozie. 68 min: Oshoala stabs an effort at goal! Norway got sloppy in defence and Ordega and co worked the ball in from the right. It bobbled into the path of Oshoala, who had a couple of red shirts for company, but managed to steer the ball goalwards. In the end it is fairly comfortable for Hjelmseth. But they were momentarily panicked. There was a whiff of complacency about that. 65 min: Norway are hardly fluent and Nigeria continue to plug away at them. Ordega remains a livewire for the African side. 61 min: Engen is grounded after a thumping \u2013 but good-natured \u2013 challenge by Chikwelu on halfway. Another short stoppage in Reims. Norway have not upped the ante since the break, but then again they seem quite happy in first gear. 58 min: Chidinma Okeke, who starred for Nigeria in the Under-20 World Cup in France last year, raids down the left and draws the foul. Good play by the teenager. That will do her confidence the world of good. Nigeria end up winning another corner but Uchendu dragged wide from the edge of the box. 55 min: Herlovsen shapes to shoot ... but Nigeria\u2019s Ohale does superbly to get across and block. They eventually repel the resulting corner after dazzling footwork by the Norway No 10 Caroline Graham Hansen. 54 min: Oluehi punches the ball clear at the near post, with Herlovsen lurking. That stoppage appears to have further unsettled Nigeria. 52 min: Michael is clearly in considerable pain. The Nigeria centre-back is carried off on a stretcher, with 18-year-old Chidinma Okeke on for her World Cup debut. 50 min: With Michael still down, Nigeria make another, unrelated change: Halimatu Ayinde is withdrawn. Chinaza Uchendu races on in her place. 49 min: Faith Michael is down injured after colliding with her own goalkeeper, Oluehi. The Nigeria medical team are on to offer some treatment while, down on the touchline, they are already readying a replacement. 47 min: Almost some early joy for Norway, who break through Herlovsen and Utland, who has been very lively. They fancy adding a fourth. Neither team opted to make changes at the interval. 46 min: Norway get the second half started. Guro Reiten news, thanks to Ole Petter Pedersen, on email. \u201cAs it doesn\u2019t seem to be mentioned, Reiten is joining Chelsea from Lillestr\u00f8m for \u00a310.000, according to VG, Norway\u2019s main news site. Her contract is up in December. She doesn\u2019t like big cities and preferred townly Lillestr\u00f8m to Oslo when moving to the capital.\u201d Half-time dispatch, courtesy of Kieran Pender: There is a buoyant atmosphere in Reims, notwithstanding the mainly empty upper-stands and the rout on the pitch. Reims is a notable French city in a number of ways: it\u2019s the unofficial capital of the Champagne wine region, once hosted the coronation ceremonies for French kings, and - somewhat more relevantly for present purposes - is home to Stade de Reims (two-time European Cup runners-up). It\u2019s also an unfortunate two-hour drive from where I am staying in Valenciennes tonight (where Australia face Italy tomorrow), so it\u2019s going to be a late night for yours truly. Norway are very much in charge at the interval. 45+2 min: Maren Mjelde fires the free-kick inches over Oluehi\u2019s goal! A cracking effort \u2013 it was just a little too north by the Chelsea defender. 45 min: There will be two added minutes, during which the first of which Norway have a very inviting free-kick on the edge of the 18-yard box. Ordega hauls down Utland, earning a booking in the process. Norway will fancy this ... 43 min: And just as Nigeria look to keep up the heat on Norway, Ngozi Ebere passes the ball straight out of play. That sums things up for them in terms of how this first period has gone; they have been short of quality when it\u2019s mattered. 40 min: Nigeria almost fashion a goal! A monstrous long throw causes havoc in the Norway box \u2013 but they cannot divert the ball home. Desire Oparanozie passed up the first bite of the cherry before Okobi badly skewed her effort. 39 min: And now Norway are cruising. Nigeria\u2019s confidence has taken a hit. Those early green shoots seem a distant memory. Isabell Herlovsen stormed to the byline, crossing for Utland but, before the Norway forward could get there, Osinachi Ohale helped it in at the near post. Great work by the Norway No 9 to panic the Nigeria defender into action. Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland powers home inside the box, blasting beyond the Nigeria goalkeeper Oluehi, who really should have done better. Nigeria cheaply ceded possession but it was more clever play by Reiten, who scored the opener, latching on to a ball before spreading the ball to her right, into the path of Utland, who calmly did the rest. It was a rasping strike \u2013 albeit straight at the Nigeria goalkeeper, with the ball zooming through her gloves. 30 min: Ordega does the hard part, whipping in a delicious ball from the right. Desire Oparanozie is in the box but the Norway goalkeeper surges off her line to meet it. Smart work by Ingrid Hjelmseth, the 39-year-old. 28 min: Oluehi makes the mess of a fairly routine Norway corner and Nigeria get off the hook. Faith Michael \u2013 there is a joke there somewhere \u2013 ends up grounded after clashing with her own goalkeeper. And both sides take the opportunity to get some fluids on board. The crowd is looking fairly sparse in Reims. 26 min: Both sides are guilty of getting sloppy in midfield, surrendering the ball too easily. Nigeria are struggling to get their captain, the Guingamp forward Desire Oparanozie, into the game. 23 min: Nigeria\u2019s Michael pokes the ball to safety after Chikwelu\u2019s careless pass gifts Norway possession inside her own half. Norway pour forward, slipping in Herlovsen but Nigeria manage to make life difficult and get the ball clear. 22 min: Ah! It is too high for anyone in a green-and-white shirt to get on the end of. That Reiten opener has killed Nigeria\u2019s early rhythm \u2013 and optimism. 21 min: Another Nigeria corner, their third of the match ... 20 min: Nigeria were the superior side but a couple of silly fouls saw them surrender ground and gave Norway a bit of initiative. Reiten fired into the corner beyond Oluehi in the goal after a bit of quick-thinking by her team-mates. A routine straight off the training ground. 19 min: Nigeria have never won a World Cup game when they have conceded the opening goal of the match. Records like that are made to be broken, right? A short-corner routine fools Nigeria, who switch off, seemingly expecting a more orthodox delivery and when the ball arrives in the box, Guro Reiten powers at goal and it flies in via Ebe, the Nigeria defender. There was no stopping that. 14 min: Maren Mjelde, the Norway skipper who plays her club football for Chelsea, steps up to lash the free-kick goalwards but it goes flying over the goal, rising high into the stands. Nigeria just lost their cool in the buildup to that opportunity. 12 min: Desire Oparanozie, the Nigeria captain, is booked for giving the Norway defender Wold a whack as she moved in off the byline to seize possession. That seems a little harsh. But then Oparanozie makes a clumsy challenge in quick succession. In doing so, they have gifted Norway a slice of encouragement. 11 min: Tochukwu Oluehi smothers the ball after Utland was threaded through on goal. An alert piece of goalkeeping by the Nigeria No 1. 10 min: Nigeria are patiently probing, playing out from the back and knocking the ball around neatly. Ordega is very lively down the right wing, zooming up and down with purpose. The African side have settled the quicker here. 8 min: Utland is momentarily clean through on goal, played in via an extremely kind ricochet \u2013 but the Norway forward is flagged offside. 6 min: Encouraging play by Nigeria! Ordega is slipped in down the right channel and attempts to slide the ball across goal in search of the captain Desire Oparanozie. It is a decent ball in but Norway manage to snuff out the danger. 5 min: Hjelmseth, the eldest member of the Norwegian squad, comfortably gathers. And tries to get her side on the front foot. They pour down the right flank but Nigeria are quick to read it and counter forward themselves. 4 min: Nigeria earn another corner ... 3 min: Utland drives into space down the right flank but her cross takes a deflection en route across goal. The Nigeria goalkeeper Oluehi hoovers it up. 2 min: Norway, who have won their opening match at the past six World Cups, concede an early corner. Ebere swings it in and Ohale makes a clean contact with the ball but cannot get enough conviction on the strike. Nigeria get us under way in Reims. Here we go! \u201cGetting out of the group would be a minor miracle,\u201d begins Abhijato Sensarma, via email, \u201cbut a mighty important step for the advancement of the game back at home. With an ever-enthusiastic crowd backing them, my keen outsider\u2019s eye will be on the Nigerian team, the proud owners of this tournament\u2019s most beautiful kit. Here\u2019s to hoping that the minor miracle happens.\u201d And we are just the national anthems away from kick-off. The players have strutted out on to the turf to the tune of The White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army. Gianni Infantino, the Fifa president, is among those in the stands. Before we get started, news of Spain\u2019s win over South Africa in their Group B opener: The teams head out of the tunnel in Reims. Here we go ... Want to get the lowdown on the teams? Look no further: Before we get stuck into this one, a moment\u2019s thought for Justin Edinburgh, and his family and friends, following his tragic death: Norway: Hjelmseth; Wold, Thorisdottir, Mjelde, Boe Risa, Herlovsen, Graham Hansen, Utland, Engen, Reiten, Minde Subs: Hovland, Hansen, Thorsnes, Fiskerstrand, Asland, Eikeland, Maanum, Kvamme, Haavi, Saevik, Nautnes, Bogstad Nigeria: Oluehi; Ohale, Ebere, Ebi, Oshoala, Oparanozie, Chikwelu, Okobi, Michael, Ordega, Ayinde Subs: Nnadozie, Jonathan, Okeke, Ogebe, Kanu, Chinaza, Imo, Ajibade, Ihezuo, Ajayi, Nweabuoku, Chukwudi Referee: Kate Jacewicz (Australia) No Hegerberg, no party?

Mistakes are going to happen and I am going to make sure we don\u2019t stop trying to play the right way. But also I have to make sure that we are firm on what is required from us as a team to win football matches. \u201cOver the year we have shown progress with some consistent performances. Will we be better in 12 months\u2019 time? Absolutely. Because we constantly need to improve. Individuals, because of their age, are bound to improve and they are hungry to do that. They want to drive on. They don\u2019t want to be settled and comfortable with semi-finals. It is not enough for them, same for me. So it is good we are on the same page.\u201d",

A little bit different! I thought we did OK, we were comfortable at 1-0, but we switched off at a set play and that\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t do at this level. But I thought the resilience and the character of the players to bounce back - because it would have been easy to feel sorry for yourself, but they didn\u2019t - was a good sign. When you get such a late blow - and it wasn\u2019t even a good header, it was poor marking, we\u2019ll have a look at the video - they way they bounced back gives us good hope for the future. I\u2019ve only been working with the group for seven training sessions, so it\u2019s not going to change overnight. But I\u2019ve given the lads a real amount of information. There are a lot of things to be pleased about, a lot of things to work on. We couldn\u2019t afford to lose.

Everyone looks at Cyprus and thinks it\u2019s a smaller nation but they have some decent players playing at a good level, and we have to be on our guard. I know we are on our guard, we\u2019re ready for the game, but we have to respect the opposition because they\u2019re decent. I\u2019ve put David Marshall in goal, because he\u2019s got a lot of experience. If you look at the team I\u2019ve picked in comparison to the two teams that played in March, I\u2019ve got close to 100 caps more in the starting XI, which for this game in particular I think is very important. Eamonn Brophy will hopefully bring us goals. We\u2019ve got creative players on the pitch, and if you give Brophy chances he will score. He\u2019ll also bring a good enthusiasm and energy to the centre-forward position, he likes to chase people down.

So we\u2019d love to say today\u2019s match against Cyprus - who have won just once in 14 away games, and that against the might of Gibraltar - was a shoo-in.

And for all their recent travails, they\u2019ve only lost two of their last 12 competitive games. (It\u2019s friendlies that really stump the Scots, with six defeats in the last seven.) Also, by winning Nations League Group C1, they\u2019ve already secured a safety net should things go badly wrong in Qualification Group I: a shot at reaching the Euro 2020 finals through the play-off route.</p> <p><strong>Still, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to get the job done properly?</strong> A win over the 89th best team in the world would give Scotland some momentum in Group I, and see new boss Steve Clarke out of the blocks quicksmart.

      "bodyText": "Ewan Murray was our man at Hampden to witness Scotland squeak past Cyprus. His report has landed, and here it is. Meanwhile thanks for reading this MBM. Anon! The new boss Steve Clarke talks to Sky Sports, the metaphorical eyebrow raised. \u201cIt was interesting. A little bit different! I thought we did OK, we were comfortable at 1-0, but we switched off at a set play and that\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t do at this level. But I thought the resilience and the character of the players to bounce back - because it would have been easy to feel sorry for yourself, but they didn\u2019t - was a good sign. When you get such a late blow - and it wasn\u2019t even a good header, it was poor marking, we\u2019ll have a look at the video - they way they bounced back gives us good hope for the future. I\u2019ve only been working with the group for seven training sessions, so it\u2019s not going to change overnight. But I\u2019ve given the lads a real amount of information. There are a lot of things to be pleased about, a lot of things to work on. We couldn\u2019t afford to lose. We go to Belgium, everyone expects them to win, but it\u2019s football, anything can happen.\u201d And did you enjoy the game tonight? \u201cNo chance!\u201d A very happy match-winner Oli Burke speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing feeling to get my first Scotland goal. Credit to the boys, who were fantastic today. I\u2019m really happy, and really happy for the team. Coming into a game like that, it\u2019s made for me to make an impact, and conceding so late drove us a little bit more, pushed us for that next goal. And I think we deserved it.\u201d Elsewhere, it was a 3-0 win for Belgium against Kazakhstan. Throw in Russia\u2019s earlier 9-0 rout of San Marino, and the table, with all teams having played three times, reads: 1. Belgium 9pts 2. Russia 6pts 3. Scotland 6pts 4. Cyprus 3pts 5. Kazakhstan 3pts 6. San Marino 0pts Scotland can go top if they beat Belgium next Tuesday, but let\u2019s not get too carried away with the new Steve Clarke era just yet. Well that was exciting. Perhaps more exciting than Steve Clarke would have preferred, but it\u2019s three points to the Scots. They were pushed all the way by Cyprus. 90 min +5: Efrem\u2019s free kick flies into the top right ... of the stand behind the goal. That\u2019s a dismal effort, and surely Scotland are home and hosed now. 90 min +4: It\u2019s very shapeless. Suddenly Costi barges down the middle of the park and buys a cheap free kick off McLean, who really didn\u2019t need to make a challenge. That\u2019s a free kick, 30 yards out, just left of centre! A chance for Cyprus to salvage a point! 90 min +2: Scotland draw a couple of fouls from Cyprus and the clock ticks on in their favour. 90 min: Then another corner for Cyprus, which is just about dealt with by the Scots this time. There will be five added minutes of this gloriously messy nonsense! What a response by Scotland! Fraser dribbles down the left and hooks a fine cross into the centre. Burke gets up above Nicholas Ioannou and sends a downward header past Pardo ... but crashing off the inside of the right-hand post. But the ball rolls into the centre, where Burke converts into the empty net with glee! Hampden roars again! The corner\u2019s hit long. Kousoulos, eight yards out and level with the far post, doesn\u2019t have to jump off the ground to meet it with a header, and plants one into the right-hand side of the goal. None of the Scottish defenders covered themselves in glory there, to say the least. Penny for the thoughts of Steve Clarke, an assured defender himself. 86 min: McGregor\u2019s corner is plucked from the heavens by Pardo, who launches long for Georgiou. The sub forces the backtracking Robertson into the concession of a corner. From which ... 85 min: Fraser makes up some ground on the left, then looks for the top right. No Robertson he, though it\u2019s a decent enough curler that forces Pardo into tipping round the post for a corner. 84 min: Scotland take the sting out of proceedings by taking an age over a throw in the professional style. Hampden is nervous. 82 min: Hampden holds its breath as Margaca fires a deep cross in from the left. Kousoulos, coming in from the right, looks to have a clear header, ten yards out, but is blocked by his own man in Sotiriou. Artymatas tries to smash the rebound home from distance, but Marshall gathers. Sleepy Scotland were so close to giving it all away there. 80 min: McGinn is replaced by McTominay. Then Makris makes way for Pittas. 78 min: Fraser, out on the left, slips a pass down the inside-left channel for the underlapping O\u2019Donnell, who draws Pardo and chips for goal. The ball bounces inches wide of the right-hand post. That would have been a picture-book goal. 77 min: But Scotland\u2019s lead is a slender one. Hampden are reminded of this when Makris has a dig from 25 yards. The ball pings off McKenna and nearly loops over Marshall, but the keeper tips over spectacularly. The resulting corner leads to nothing. But Cyprus were so close to a very fortunate equaliser there. 76 min: A gorgeous bit of skill by Fraser, tight to the chalk out on the left. With little space to play with, or margin for error, he chips the ball down the line past Kousoulos and skedaddles towards the box. At which point he rather runs out of ideas, but that\u2019s a fine run nonetheless. 75 min: Artymatas is booked for excessively bothering McGregor. A free kick midway in Cypriot territory. Scotland rather conservatively play it backwards, professionalism rather than entertainment the watchword. See, this is where Uefa Multiball would come into its own. 74 min: Burke comes on for the luckless Brophy, who hasn\u2019t really had much chance to shine on his debut. 72 min: Cyprus stroke the ball around in midfield for a while, the rhythm of the game having been disrupted by Spoljaric\u2019s injury. For a while, there are two balls on the pitch. The referee doesn\u2019t stop the game, perhaps under instruction from Uefa to trial a new multiball system. And you thought VAR was needless tinkering. 70 min: Spoljaric has tweaked something, so he\u2019s replaced by Costi. 68 min: Scottish tails are up now. They\u2019re passing it around with much more confidence. Cyprus by contrast are sitting back, hoping to weather the storm. What a difference a goal makes, is a cliche for a reason. 66 min: The resulting corner ... you know how this goes by now. Once Cyprus clear their lines, they swap Michalis Ioannou for Georgiou. 65 min: McGregor, to the right of the D, has a shot towards the bottom right. Pardo parries. He should gather, but spills the ball round the post. It was inches away from squirting into the net. The keeper got away with one there. 64 min: McGinn sends a pass wide to Fraser, who is dribbling again with more purpose and intent, just as he did during the early stages of this match. He can\u2019t quite break through on the edge of the area, but Cyprus were worried for a minute there. 62 min: And there\u2019s the Hampden Roar at last! The goal deserved nothing less. Robertson is a special player, and he\u2019s being serenaded by the crowd accordingly. What a goal! McGinn, in a central position, slips the ball left to Robertson, who is racing towards it with extreme intent. He meets it first time, flush, sending a diagonal rising heat-seeker into the top right, Pardo with no chance whatsoever! A captain\u2019s goal from a European champion. What a week he\u2019s had! 60 min: Sotiriou bustles down the left and wins a corner off O\u2019Donnell. Another wasted set-piece will be along in a minute. And there it is. Scotland clear. 59 min: McGregor passes the ball into touch while standing one yard from the white line, under no pressure whatsoever. A few addled Scottish heads right now as they hectically search for the breakthrough. 57 min: Robertson\u2019s cross from the left is swallowed hole by Pardo. Nobody in there challenging. On the touchline, Steve Clarke shows his first signs of concern. 56 min: Fraser runs at the Cypriot back line, but loses confidence as he approaches the final third. The hosts need to up their game, quick-smart. 54 min: And now a few whistles thrown in as Efrem earns a corner down the left. The set piece is claimed by Marshall. Scotland\u2019s surge since the restart didn\u2019t last long. 52 min: Artymatas strides from the back like Beckenbauer, nobody bothering to close him down. He picks out Spoljaric upfield. Spoljaric races through a big gap between Mulgrew and McKenna, and sends a shot towards the bottom right. Marshall smothers, but the home faithful are getting worried. This second half had begun with a passionate, full-throated chorus of the Bonnie Banks o\u2019 Loch Lomand. But that Hampden Increasingly Concerned Mutter\u2019s back now. 50 min: Sotiriou busies himself on the edge of the Scotland box, then sends a pass right for Makris, who fizzes a low one into the box. Fortunately for Scotland, it\u2019s just behind Sotiriou, and the hosts clear. 49 min: A positive run by Forrest down the right leads to a corner, which in turn leads to nothing. Pardo\u2019s still to have his hands seriously warmed by Scotland. 48 min: Added energy = good. Rushes of blood = bad. Fraser and Brophy work a little space down the left, the ball breaking back to Robertson, who must still be high on life after events in Madrid last Saturday. He smashes a very ambitious shot from distance miles over the bar. 47 min: Roberson hoicks a long one down the left. McGregor gets on the end of it, and sends a huge up-and-under of a cross into the box. It\u2019s easy pickings for Pardo. But it looks as though Scotland have been given the half-time rocket by their new manager, because there\u2019s an early energy about them. We go again! Cyprus get the second half underway; there have been no half-time changes. Half-time entertainment. Scotland\u2019s women take on England tomorrow evening. Ahead of the big one, here\u2019s Louise Taylor\u2019s highly entertaining romp through the history of the women\u2019s game, a tale that takes in outraged 17th-century ministers, the suffragettes, and some World Cup final hat-trick heroics that have nothing whatsoever to do with Geoff Hurst. (Also, the pictures from the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup in Mexico City are sensational.) Where\u2019s Colin Stein when you need him? 45 min: McGregor goes sliding into a 50-50 with Michalis Ioannou. He crumps his studs into his opponent\u2019s knee, and is very fortunate just to see yellow. That was a poor challenge. 44 min: McLean launches long down the inside-left channel. He\u2019s very close to finding Fraser free, but there\u2019s one too many joules of energy applied to the ball, and Pardo can come out and gather. 43 min: Robertson picks up the pace and barrels down the inside-left channel. He slips a ball wide to Brophy, who enters the box, makes for the byline and crosses well. But the flag goes up for offside. Brophy had gone too early, though only just. Not much in that at all. 41 min: And I bet this moment gave Robertson another sort of rush, as Sotiriou strides free down his flank and shoots diagonally, low and hard, towards the bottom left. Marshall does very well to paw the ball away as it threatens to worm its way into the corner. Scotland clear their lines, but that was close. 39 min: Robertson sends Fraser into space down the left. He crosses, and claims a penalty when the ball hits the arm of Kousoulos, just inside the box. It didn\u2019t look as though the defender\u2019s arm was in an unnatural position, though I\u2019d pay a penny or two for the thoughts of Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Moussa Sissoko. I bet that passage of play gave Andrew Robertson a Proustian rush. 38 min: Fraser slips the ball in from the left for McGregor, who tees up Forrest on the edge of the box. Forrest shoots through a thicket, the ball rearing up and falling gently into the arms of Pardo. 36 min: Spoljaric heads forward in the hope of setting Efrem free down the middle. All he does is catch his team-mate offside. Small acorns, and all that, but at least the early attacking threat of Cyprus has been somewhat blunted in the last 20 minutes or so. 34 min: The corner\u2019s half cleared. McGinn, deep on the right, loops into the mixer. Pardo, yet to be forced into meaningful action, rises to pluck the ball from the sky. 33 min: A not particularly good cross by Forrest from the right. But Nicholas Ioannou doesn\u2019t realise he\u2019s got space and time, and so heads behind for a corner. It comes in from the left and McKenna rises highest. His header is deflected wide right for Scotland\u2019s fifth corner of the evening. 31 min: A one-two between Fraser and McGregor sends the former scuttling away down the left. He crosses deep. Too deep. It\u2019s a free kick. But at least the Hampden Increasingly Concerned Mutter has piped down ... and the pipes are piping up. A nice carnival atmosphere inside Hampden at the moment, despite the scoreline. 29 min: Some good work by McGinn, who wriggles clear of a challenge in his own half and strokes a pinpoint long pass to Fraser on the left. Fraser\u2019s in a lot of space, but can\u2019t quite get a shot away, and has to wait for support. Eventually the ball is worked to Forrest on the right; he\u2019s equally ponderous when faced with the chance to shoot. The ball goes back to the left, Robertson injecting some trademark energy and winning a corner, though the set piece isn\u2019t worth writing home about. But this is better from Scotland, who are spending more time in enemy territory now. 27 min: Mulgrew takes. And it\u2019s a decent free kick, up over the wall and back down, the ball heading into the bottom right. Pardo does very well to turn the ball behind for a corner. The resulting set-piece is hit long, and the debutant Brophy gets his first meaningful touch of the match, stooping to head a difficult chance just wide. That\u2019ll give the young man a boost after a quiet start to his Scotland career. 26 min: Affronted by Laifis and his Beckhamesque stylings - actually more like Pele, come to think about it, seeing he missed - Scotland launch an attack. Forrest slips the ball in from the right to McGinn, who turns and is tugged back by Nicholas Ioannou. That\u2019s a booking for the Cyprus centre-back, and a free kick just to the right of the D. 24 min: Laifis tries to score from inside his own half, having spotted Marshall wandering free. It\u2019s safe to say the opening exchanges have filled Cyprus with confidence. 22 min: More of that Cypriot possession. After stroking it around for an age, Makris eventually bursts into a little space down the right and very nearly finds Sotiriou in the box with a clever ball down the channel. Not quite. Still no Hampden Roar, but you don\u2019t have to strain your ears to hear the Hampden Increasingly Concerned Mutter. 20 min: \u201cDespite the possession stats, we\u2019re not 2-0 down. This is progress.\u201d The tinder-dry Simon McMahon, people. 18 min: Scotland are opened up down the middle with great ease, as Sotiriou spins through 360 degrees to fox Mulgrew, and is nearly brought down by McKenna on the edge of the box. The ball breaks to Michalis Ioannou, whose first-time shot is blocked and breaks to Efrem on the right. Efrem shoots straight at Marshall, the only man he has to beat. Scotland extremely fortunate that Sotiriou couldn\u2019t ride the questionable challenge by McKenna, because he was otherwise in. 16 min: Fraser is upended just to the left of the Cyprus box by Kousoulos. A free kick in a very dangerous position here. Fraser takes it himself, curling it low into the six-yard box. It\u2019s a dreadful effort, nowhere near a team-mate, and delivered with no force, so there\u2019s no manic pinball. Instead, Laifis traps with a yawn and clears his lines. 14 min: Scotland have woken up. Fraser yet again picks up possession on the left, and lays off for McGregor, who takes a stride before whipping a low cross through the box. None of his team-mates were there to take advantage of a ball trundling along the corridor of uncertainty in the style of a Breeders video. 13 min: Fraser again works himself some space down the left. He tears into it, then cuts the ball back to nobody in particular. But the ball eventually ends up at the feet of McGregor, who has a dig from distance. It\u2019s blocked by a white shirt ... and not a hand, as McGregor claims, hoping for a free kick in a central position. 11 min: But this is nice from Scotland. Robertson curls a pass down the left flank for Fraser, who immediately shuttles the ball inside for McGregor. The brisk, free-flowing move leads to a corner ... which leads to nothing much, but baby steps and all that. 9 min: There\u2019s already a little nervousness in the Hampden air, as Cyprus continue to dominate. They\u2019ve had 66 percent of possession so far. And that nearly turns into a much more meaningful stat, as Efrem is found in space just to the right of the Scottish box. He dinks a cross towards Sotiriou at the far post. The striker can\u2019t connect, but that was lovely football by the visitors. 7 min: But Cyprus are still enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession, looking very assured as they ping it around. Makris and Efrem combine well on the right flank, and briefly threaten to open Scotland up, but Robertson and Fraser make sure nothing untoward occurs. 5 min: Scotland launch their first sortie upfield. Forrest slips Fraser away down the left, and gets the return on the edge of the box. He opens his body to curl towards the top right, but doesn\u2019t get it quite right, and the rising, fizzing effort flies harmlessly over the bar. That warmed up the crowd, who had previously been a little muted. 4 min: This is a confident start by Cyprus. Spoljaric strokes a pass from the centre circle down the right for Makris to chase, and Makris very nearly gets on the end of it. Robertson does very well to get across just in time and shepherd the ball out for a goal kick. 2 min: Cyprus stroke it around the back awhile, in order to find their feet. They look relaxed and confident ... until the keeper has a go, and sends a slightly hysterical one upfield that only just evades interception. But that\u2019s some early possession for the visitors. A minute\u2019s silence for erstwhile Uefa kingpin Lennart Johansson, who died this week ... and then the game begins! The hosts get the ball rolling. The ball\u2019s launched long and flies out of play, four seconds on the clock. The only way is up in the Clarke era! The teams are out! No Hampden Roar to meet them, but a smattering of light applause. Then the skirl of the pipes and a quick rendition of Flower of Scotland. The Cypriot number is a jaunty waltz. Scotland are in the beautiful simplicity of their dark-blue kit, while Cyprus wear their second-choice white. Hands are clasped, pennants are exchanged, coins are tossed, and we\u2019ll be off in minute! Scotland\u2019s midfield should have a spring in the collective step, despite a long season finishing in June. All three members enjoyed a fine end to their campaigns, Kenny McLean winning the Championship with Norwich City, John McGinn scoring the winner in the play-off final to secure promotion for Aston Villa, and Callum McGregor securing the Treble Treble, and consigning us all to a David Bowie earworm, with Celtic. Throw in new European champion Andy Robertson, and the Scottish Player of the Year James Forrest, and these lads should be brimming with confidence. Having just typed all that out, I\u2019m not 100 percent sure I should be tempting fate by posting it, Scotland are still piecing their confidence back together in the wake of 1978 after all. But we can\u2019t be living our lives in constant fear, so here goes nothing. The new manager Steve Clarke speaks! \u201cIt\u2019s just a normal match day. Good preparation. A team meeting before we left the hotel. Now it\u2019s over to the players. I think it\u2019ll be difficult. Everyone looks at Cyprus and thinks it\u2019s a smaller nation but they have some decent players playing at a good level, and we have to be on our guard. I know we are on our guard, we\u2019re ready for the game, but we have to respect the opposition because they\u2019re decent. I\u2019ve put David Marshall in goal, because he\u2019s got a lot of experience. If you look at the team I\u2019ve picked in comparison to the two teams that played in March, I\u2019ve got close to 100 caps more in the starting XI, which for this game in particular I think is very important. Eamonn Brophy will hopefully bring us goals. We\u2019ve got creative players on the pitch, and if you give Brophy chances he will score. He\u2019ll also bring a good enthusiasm and energy to the centre-forward position, he likes to chase people down. I\u2019m pleased that he\u2019s in the team and I hope that he does very well.\u201d There\u2019s already been one result in Group I today. Russia have drubbed San Marino 9-0 in Mordovia, captain Artem Dzyuba helping himself to four of the goals. That\u2019s put them second in the table, on six points behind leaders Belgium, who will most likely pull ahead this evening after playing Kazakhstan at home. So Scotland, currently with three points, could certainly do with a win to keep themselves on the leaders\u2019 tails. The former Kilmarnock boss Steve Clarke hands one of his old charges a Scotland debut tonight. The 23-year-old striker Eamonn Brophy pulls on a dark blue shirt for the first time, having finished the season strongly with winners for Killie against Hibernian and Rangers. David Marshall meanwhile returns in goal, taking over from Scott Bain after a three-year wait for another cap. Scotland: Marshall, O\u2019Donnell, Mulgrew, McKenna, Robertson, McGinn, McLean, McGregor, Forrest, Brophy, Fraser. Subs: Bain, Palmer, Souttar, Findlay, McTominay, Russell, Armstrong, McNulty, Cairney, Burke, Taylor, McLaughlin. Cyprus: Pardo, Kousoulos, Nicholas Ioannou, Laifis, Margaca, Spoljaric, Artymatas, Makris, Efrem, Sotiriou, Michalis Ioannou. Subs: Petrou, Vasiliou, Katelaris, Antoniou, Mitidis, Avraam, Antoniades, Costi, Georgiou, Pittas, Michael. Referee: Ola Hobber Nilsen (Norway). It\u2019s fair to say Scotland haven\u2019t got off to a flyer in the Euro 2020 qualifiers. A risible 3-0 loss in Kazakhstan was followed by an extremely uncertain 2-0 win against San Marino, a team that has avoided defeat once in the last 15 years, and Big Eck was sent on his way. So we\u2019d love to say today\u2019s match against Cyprus - who have won just once in 14 away games, and that against the might of Gibraltar - was a shoo-in. But, well, y\u2019know. History is very much on Scotland\u2019s side, though. They\u2019ve won all five of their previous matches against the Cypriots, by a healthy aggregate score of 20-4, although that total has been slightly skewed by an 8-0 thumping in 1969. And for all their recent travails, they\u2019ve only lost two of their last 12 competitive games. (It\u2019s friendlies that really stump the Scots, with six defeats in the last seven.) Also, by winning Nations League Group C1, they\u2019ve already secured a safety net should things go badly wrong in Qualification Group I: a shot at reaching the Euro 2020 finals through the play-off route. Still, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to get the job done properly? A win over the 89th best team in the world would give Scotland some momentum in Group I, and see new boss Steve Clarke out of the blocks quicksmart. Hampden expects. Kick-off is at 7.45pm. It\u2019s on!",

But the Scandinavians soon settled into their rhythm, building pressure with a couple of free-kicks just outside penalty area. The Barcelona winger Caroline Graham Hansen then capitalised, scything into the box on a mazy run from a short corner before finding Reiten, who duly converted. Norway nearly doubled their advantage five minutes later, with Isabell Herlovsen only just failing to connect with a through-ball from a rapid counterattack. But despite a surfeit of Norway chances, the Nigerians \u2013 11 times African Cup of Nations winners \u2013 kept themselves in the game thanks to sound goalkeeping from Tochukwu Oluehi and a robust defensive display. But any optimism proved short-lived. As the clock ticked towards half-time, Reiten went from scorer to provider \u2013 laying off a beautifully timed pass for Lisa-Marie Utland to fire home. The onslaught continued three minutes later, with a dangerous cross from Herlovsen ricocheting off Nigeria\u2019s Osinachi Ohale for an own-goal. Trudging towards the tunnel at the interval, the Nigerians looked despondent \u2013 with South Korea and France to go, their World Cup journey will not get easier. The second half was less lively, with a number of injury stoppages leading to staccato periods of play and the Norwegians sitting back safe in the knowledge that victory was secure. Nigeria\u2019s forward line tried hard to keep the 11,508-strong crowd entertained, with Barcelona\u2019s young talent Asisat Oshoala going close on several occasions. But neither side would trouble the scoreline as the match edged towards its conclusion. Norway were once the heavyweights of women\u2019s football. They finished runners-up at the inaugural Women\u2019s World Cup in 1991 before going one better at the second edition, in Sweden. Five years later they won the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. But the intervening years have been less kind to the Norwegians. They exited the 2011 World Cup at the group stage, failed to progress beyond the last 16 four years later and have failed to qualify for consecutive Olympic Games. It would be premature to suggest that Norway\u2019s barren run is over. Despite being perennial African champions, Nigeria are ranked a lowly 38th in the Fifa rankings, well below the Norwegians in 12th. But the performance from Martin Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s side provides evidence, bolstered by victory in March at the prestigious invite-only Algarve Cup, that the Norwegians are resurgent. Reims was once the site where France crowned its kings. Norway have a long way to go before they may be crowned queens of the 2019 Women\u2019s World Cup. But if they reach the final in Lyon, they will look back on their visit to regal Reims as an auspicious, history-repeating triumph over Nigeria. \u2022 Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

      "bodyText": "The Home Office is being accused of institutional racism and damaging British research projects through increasingly arbitrary and \u201cinsulting\u201d visa refusals for academics. In April, a team of six Ebola researchers from Sierra Leone were unable to attend vital training in the UK, funded by the Wellcome Trust as part of a \u00a31.5m flagship pandemic preparedness programme. At the LSE Africa summit, also in April, 24 out of 25 researchers were missing from a single workshop. Shortly afterwards, the Save the Children centenary events were marred by multiple visa refusals of key guests. There are echoes of the wider hostile environment across the Home Office, with MPs on a parliamentary inquiry into visa refusals hearing evidence that there is \u201can element of systemic prejudice against applicants\u201d. In a letter in today\u2019s Observer 70 senior leaders from universities and research institutes across the UK warn that \u201cvisa refusals for African cultural, development and academic leaders \u2026 [are] undermining \u2018Global Britain\u2019s\u2019 reputation as well as efforts to tackle global challenges\u201d.

The AFP\u2019s acting commissioner, Neil Gaughan, said on Thursday such investigations were complex, lengthy, and driven by nothing other than operational and evidential considerations. The election played no role in their timing, and the AFP was not attempting to intimidate journalists, he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAny inference that suggests our decisions were influenced by anybody outside the organisation is strongly refuted,\u201d Gaughan said.</p> \n<p>The police union, for its part, urged the public to remember officers were just doing their job, following the law as it exists.

Metadata \u2013 details about a particular communication, rather than the content of the communication itself \u2013 now must be retained by telecommunications companies for two years.

      "bodyText": "David McBride was almost out of Sydney when his phone lit up. It was his ex-wife. Something was wrong. She rarely called when she knew he was behind the wheel. \u201cShe said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to tell you something. I\u2019ve got a news alert on my email that said the ABC offices have been raided over the Afghan Files,\u2019\u201d McBride says. \u201cWe both kind of nervously laughed, and she said, \u2018I\u2019ll speak to you later.\u2019\u201d As McBride continued the long drive home from Sydney to Canberra, federal police were busy sifting through sensitive documents at the ABC\u2019s Sydney headquarters. They had the power to add, copy, delete or alter anything relevant to the 2017 Afghan files expos\u00e9 on special forces misconduct in the Afghanistan war. The warrant listed McBride as the police\u2019s first subject of interest. McBride unleashed powerful forces when he decided to go public years ago with what he discovered as a military lawyer serving in Afghanistan. Those forces have already exacted a crippling toll. \u201c[My ex-wife] would probably say \u2013 and I think there\u2019s an element of truth in it \u2013 it killed David McBride,\u201d he says. \u201cThe man that she married was killed by the defence force, and I\u2019m someone who\u2019s different. \u201cDoing something like this, taking on the whole government, it sends shockwaves through your life, and not much survives, really.\u201d Wednesday\u2019s raid on the ABC prompted outrage among civil rights groups, transparency campaigners, journalists and unions. It came just a day after federal police searched the home of the News Corp reporter Annika Smethurst, searching for documents related to her coverage of proposed new surveillance powers for the Australian Signals Directorate. 2GB host Ben Fordham\u2019s revelation about asylum seeker boats attempting to reach Australia from Sri Lanka is also the subject of a home affairs investigation, as the department attempts to identify his source. The raids have not occurred in isolation. Multiple whistleblowers who revealed government wrongdoing are currently being pursued through the courts with alarming vigour. The government is prosecuting Witness K and Bernard Collaery, who revealed an unlawful spy operation against Timor-Leste during oil negotiations. Richard Boyle, the tax office worker who revealed the government\u2019s heavy-handed approach to recovering debts, faces a long stint in jail if convicted. Assoc Prof Joseph Fernandez, a journalism lecturer at Curtin University, has spent years studying source protection and the Australian media. He says the consequences of this week\u2019s raids are clear, regardless of whether journalists are charged. \u201cSuch raids, regardless of what happens here to journalists or to others, will have an immeasurable censoring effect on contact people have with journalists,\u201d Fernandez says. \u201cIn my research in this area over the years, it was clear that even senior public servants are apprehensive about having contact with journalists, even about mundane things, in the wake of laws that enable the authorities to track down sources.\u201d The McBride matter had been bubbling away for some time before Wednesday\u2019s raid. Guardian Australia understands police have been talking to the ABC since at least September, trying to find a way to access the documents without resorting to a very public raid. The ABC did not hand over the documents. The AFP also maintains there was no notification to the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, before the raids. He was alerted only after they took place, the AFP says. But critics have raised suspicions about the proximity of the raids to the federal election and the time that has passed since the original publications. Prof John Blaxland, a former army officer now with the Australian National University\u2019s Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, says the optics suggest overreach. \u201cMultiple raids in the one week, so shortly after the election outcome and without a compelling explanation, leave us wondering as to whether this is something that has been pending for some time, something that those authorising them knew would generate controversy that was best left until early in a new term of office, when the political fallout could be contained,\u201d Blaxland says. It\u2019s a suggestion the AFP has flatly denied. The AFP\u2019s acting commissioner, Neil Gaughan, said on Thursday such investigations were complex, lengthy, and driven by nothing other than operational and evidential considerations. The election played no role in their timing, and the AFP was not attempting to intimidate journalists, he said. \u201cAny inference that suggests our decisions were influenced by anybody outside the organisation is strongly refuted,\u201d Gaughan said. The police union, for its part, urged the public to remember officers were just doing their job, following the law as it exists. Police were acting on referrals made to them by the defence department. \u201cI understand that there is intense media reporting in relation to these warrants and I am proud of the way AFP members have professionally executed their duties during this trying time,\u201d the federal police union boss, Angela Smith, told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe members involved are doing their job and doing it professionally.\u201d Denis Muller, from the University of Melbourne\u2019s Centre for Advancing Journalism, says arguments about the police operating at arm\u2019s length from government miss the point. \u201cThe point is that the politicians have constructed a repressive legal regime designed to protect the executive branch of government, impede accountability to the public and exert a chilling effect on the press,\u201d Muller wrote in the Conversation. Police were acting under old laws when they raided Smethurst and the ABC. The AFP said it was acting under \u201csecrecy offences in Part 6 and 7 of the Crimes Act 1914\u201d. Those laws bar public servants from unauthorised disclosures, and prohibit the publication of official secrets. In recent years, the powers available to the government have increased dramatically. In 2015, both major parties helped usher in metadata retention laws, which prompted huge concern for the anonymity of journalists\u2019 sources. Metadata \u2013 details about a particular communication, rather than the content of the communication itself \u2013 now must be retained by telecommunications companies for two years. A vast number of government agencies are allowed warrantless access to the metadata. Late last year, the Communications Alliance said its members had received requests from at least 80 different government agencies. Police are required to obtain a warrant to access a journalists\u2019 metadata and say the need to access a reporter\u2019s details is \u201cextremely rare\u201d. They admitted in 2017 that they had failed to get a warrant in one such case. Further laws were enacted last year allowing the government to compel technology companies to assist in decrypting private communications. The new powers again threatened a key avenue of communication between whistleblowers and journalists \u2013 encrypted messaging applications. Labor\u2019s Mark Dreyfus has raised concerns about the raids, questioning why they have taken so long, and expressing doubt that government ministers were not aware of the operation. He has suggested a Senate inquiry may be needed. \u201cThe government is responsible for this,\u201d Dreyfus told the ABC. \u201cThese are government documents, this is government information, the government referred this to the Australian Federal Police.\u201d Blaxland believes a \u201crobust examination\u201d of Australia\u2019s intelligence and national security regime is now needed, to take stock of the current laws and to better address serious risks posed by attacks such as the one revealed this week that targeted the Australian National University. \u201cWe know much legislation has been approved concerning these domains in recent times and it is time for a holistic review,\u201d Blaxland says. \u201cIssues that should be addressed range from the industrial-scale hacking of national institutions \u2026 the largely unexplained aggregation of powers in the home affairs portfolio and the related discomfort evident within associated security and intelligence agencies. \u201cI advocate this not out of some conspiratorial obsession, but because I sense the need to clear the air, to assure the public of what is going on and, where practices are suboptimal or excessive, to ensure recommendations are made and enacted upon to see that they are modified.\u201d Tensions between national security and a free press are not unique to Australia. The United Nations enshrines the right to access information and protections for sources and whistleblowers through the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Australia has ratified. Yet a 2015 UN study into source protections, the first of its kind, found governments across the world were failing to ensure \u201cadequate protections to whistleblowers and sources of information\u201d. Clashes between the need for secrecy and the public\u2019s right to know were common, the report found. But where such difficulties emerged, the UN said governments should always avoid enacting laws that restrict free speech. \u201cWhen the right and the restriction clash, as they are often purported to do, governments and international organisations should not adopt laws and policies that default in favour of the restrictions,\u201d the UN\u2019s special rapporteur found. Australia\u2019s whistleblower protections \u2013 chiefly available through the Public Interest Disclosure Act \u2013 face frequent criticism for their weaknesses. Government whistleblowers must take extreme care to raise concerns internally and with external watchdog agencies before they can go public. Even then, whistleblowers are able to obtain protection for disclosures to the media only in limited circumstances. It\u2019s a common theme among whistleblowers who have been prosecuted. The ATO whistleblower, Boyle, raised his concerns internally through the PID Act before going public. He now faces a maximum 161-year sentence.

McBride similarly made internal complaints, sought protection, and went to the police. The leak has already caused him to spend one night in detention, and he faces a long stint in jail if he loses his case. Despite all the pain it has caused him, McBride says he would take the same course if he had his time again. \u201cMy lifelong friends kind of laugh at the irony of me being a whistleblower, because it\u2019s not what anyone would have expected of me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when you\u2019re confronted with behaviour which is so bad, you don\u2019t really have a choice, whether you\u2019re a goody two-shoes or not.\u201d",

A new architecture of left and progressive thinktanks has been constructed, working together to enable the left to hegemonise the next stage in the political debate about the future of our country. But until we can get a general election, the country still faces the frightening prospect of a hard-right Tory leader pushing a no-deal Brexit and yet more tax and spending cuts. With the burning injustices getting even more painful, that\u2019s something that should terrify all of us. It should also ensure we demand that the people have the democratic power to prevent a no-deal Brexit and a new wave of tax and spending cuts.",

(Anyone?) This is the game for you if you support New Zealand, have a soft spot for Afghanistan, can\u2019t abide England or like a bit of novelty. These two teams have only ever met once in one-day internationals, in the last World Cup, when Daniel Vettori made sure <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/scorecard/656459/new-zealand-vs-afghanistan-31st-match-pool-a-icc-cricket-world-cup-2014-15\">it wasn\u2019t much of a contest</a>. But that was in Napier, where I suspect there weren\u2019t many Afghanistan supporters. Today, in Taunton, at the weekend, the cheers should be more evenly distributed. </p> <p>The New Zealanders are top of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2019/may/30/cricket-world-cup-2019-latest-standings\">the table</a> with two wins out of two and a commanding net run rate, but they\u2019ve had a relatively gentle start (Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). Afghanistan have lost to Australia and, more painfully, to Sri Lanka, but they\u2019re spirited and skilful and will surely rattle one of the big teams in this World Cup. Today would be a great time to do it, as it would prove, with four weeks of the round robin still to come, that these days, heaven knows, anything goes.</p> <p>Play starts at 1.30pm BST and the forecast is for sunny spells.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T11:54:35.307Z\">at 12.54pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "For Afghanistan, English conditions have not been kind. A seven wicket loss to Australia, a 34-run defeat by an unconvincing Sri Lanka, and now a seven wicket loss to a New Zealand side with a somewhat rusty Kane Williamson. The loss of Rashid Khan was always going to be too much of a hurdle to get over, especially when defending such a small total. There\u2019s no update as yet on his health after that crack on the helmet from Ferguson - but they\u2019ve got nearly a week till their next game, against the down-at-heel South Africans. On the plus side, Ramat Shah\u2019s part-time leg-spin produced a couple of smashing deliveries and Hashmatullah\u2019s fifty deserved more than a loss with 17 overs to spare. That\u2019s it from me, thanks for all your emails, sorry I didn\u2019t have time to put them all up or reply, enjoy your evening! Jimmy Neesham wins the man of the match award for his best bowling figures of five for 31 and New Zealand are top of the table, having played three and won three! So Black Caps - can the inconspicuous win the World Cup? Can Kane Williamson, a cooler head even than Eoin Morgan, carry the trophy home? Their next game against India is one for the diary. Fire and Ice. With a pull off Aftab Alam, Williamson wins the match! Williamson not out 79, Latham not out 13. 32nd over: New Zealand 172-3 (Williamson 79, Latham 13) Hamid Hassan does enough to ensure that there will be one more over. Scores are level. James is rubbing his fingers with glee at the thought of an international transfer to the County Ground at Northampton... As a Northants fan, I\u2019d love to see Rahmat Shah replacing Alex Wakely at 3 and bowling in \u2018spin-twin\u2019 tandem with Rob Keogh. Now that Afghanistan is a full test nation, there are no ECB rules stopping this from happening. Please forward this to Wantage Road! 31st over: New Zealand 168-3 (Williamson 77, Latham 11) Aftab Alam keeps it tight but they still drill six off the over. Easy pickings now. Abhijato Sensarma has been thinking, which he does a lot! All\u2019s well that ends well, but Kane Williamson has looked either too elegant or too scratchy in recent times. He can either get stuck into a rut, or play cuts and execute delicate dabs better than anyone else on the planet, depending on his mood when he comes out to bat. Is this bipolar touch syndrome temporary, or will it carry into the latter half of the World Cup as well? If it does, as a Kiwi fan I would feel blessed on the days he gets going, and a bit tentative on the days he doesn\u2019t. He\u2019s shouldering a lot of responsibility, so while the nerves of steel combined with the determination to stay out in the middle usually bode well, against attacking teams like England and India this strategy of batting slowly for a lonf time without an adequate acceleration might come back to bite him. Fingers crossed that he flicks on his switch to become the best batsman of this tournament once these warm-ups are done with! 30th over: New Zealand 162-3 (Williamson 74, Latham 8) Hamid Hassan pitches one a little full and Williamson cracks it through midwicket for four. Pitter-patter a few singles and New Zealand are nearly there. Their first three matches were against the less powerful sides, and they\u2019ve won them all. Job done. If not spectacularly. Now, for the nail-biters. 29th over: New Zealand 155-3 (Williamson 68, Latham 8) When all of a sudden two and two make four instead of 3.4869. Kane Williamson watches Gulbadin and sees a beach ball: back foot, front foot, pint point, fours. 28th over: New Zealand 143-3 (Williamson 57, Latham 5) Aftab knows that lbw appeal against Latham was out. His eyes, mouth and arms scream it. But no. The umpire humours him by explaining there was an inside edge. Saurya Chakrabort writes: Greetings! Over the last couple of years, I\u2019ve become hopelessly addicted to the OBO coverage, which I find provides a fantastic contrast to the ball-by-ball stuff from Cricinfo. Why thank you on behalf of my esteemed colleagues! Also, huge props to you for the fantastic County blog...the off-beat poetry BTL is some of the best one can ever come across. Aww you\u2019re too nice. It is a bit niche... Anyway, let me attempt a segue to the County game- apart from the established box office stars like Rashid Khan and Mohammed Nabi, do you see anyone else from the team being a valuable addition to a county side at present? Would love to know your insight on a specific player and a specific gap he could fill in a specific county side.That\u2019s too many specifics in one line. Specific away. Come on OBOers, your thoughts please. 27th over: New Zealand 141-3 (Williamson 57, Latham 5) Seven off Gulbadin\u2019s over with narry a dash of danger. Lawrie Taylor is not alone in thinking ahead. I n reply to Alistair\u2019s comment about NZ team effort, yes I think you are right they seem to be avoiding taking the lower order teams to the \u201ccleaners\u201d. Maybe their real test will be when they come up against the West Indies against whom Australia had to dig themselves out of a hole. 26th over: New Zealand 134-3 (Williamson 47, Latham 4) A blow for New Zealand, but one they should be able to take. Latham takes no prisoners, watches Aftab for a ball, and sends his next, another full-toss, straight back past the bowler for four. 39 needed. The ball after Taylor gets four from a misfield, Aftab gets his revenge. Taylor misses a full-toss and his off stump disappears. 25th over: New Zealand 124-2 (Williamson 47, Taylor 42) Nabi\u2019s first ball is launched by a smiling Taylor on to the roof of the Andy Caddick pavillion. Andy Caddick would not be smiling. At half-way, the shadows s-t-r-e-t-c-h across the playing surface and across Afghanistan\u2019s campaign. Williamson cuts, for two, and that\u2019s his fifty. Inelegant by his standards, unusually grafting, but he\u2019s on his way. 24th over: New Zealand 113-2 (Williamson 47, Taylor 35) Six off the over, Williamson biffs a Ramat Shah long-hop to the boundary as the midgies flap about Taunton and MC Hammer hits the tannoy. 23rd over: New Zealand 107-2 (Williamson 42, Taylor 34) Taylor throws a thick-edge past the keeper and down to the boundary. Slow and steady black-caps, slow and steady. 22nd over: New Zealand 101-2 (Williamson 42, Taylor 28) A handful of singles off Ramat. And an answer to Alistair\u2019s question: aren\u2019t New Zealand by nature no better than they have to be? Too chilled to be outrageous for the sake of it? This is just the warm-up. Isn\u2019t it? 21st over: New Zealand 97-2 (Williamson 40, Taylor 26) Gulbadin bowls a no ball because there aren\u2019t enough fielders in the circle and to make it worse, Williamson cracks him for four. Then more awkwardness from Williamson who is out of sorts, in the way that only class batsmen can be out of sorts. 20th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 33, Taylor 26) 19th over: New Zealand 89-2 (Williamson 33, Taylor 26) Ramat unleashes a cracking leggie which beats Taylor. Alistair writes from Lyon. Unpatriotic of me, but I have a sinking feeling that NZ are no better than they need to be. They will win the match, but they will make it look close, as against Bangladesh. They should have killed it in 20 overs, as they did with Sri Lanka. Higher risk, bigger rewards. Or are they hiding their light under a bushel, to fool the big boys? Discuss. 19th over: New Zealand 88-2 (Williamson 32, Taylor 26) Did I say Williamson was out of touch? Gulbadin sends one in a little short and Williamson pulls it for four like an irritated man with a point to prove. A couple looking thoroughly cold and wrapped up in blankets pop up on the TV. The shade on a chilly June late afternoon is not a good place to be. 18th over: New Zealand 81-2 (Williamson 27, Taylor 25) A comedy bit of fielding down in the deep by Hamid, who gets into position and then lets the ball run through his entire defence system to. A death-star like flaw. My ten year old helper tells me New Zealand\u2019s next game is against India on Thursday. 17th over: New Zealand 75-2 (Williamson 26, Taylor 20) Crowded house comes over the tannoy - bringing back happy memories of driving a camper van round New Zealand when we were over for my brother Sam\u2019s wedding. Well, I say driving - passengering, but in control of the CD player. Fat Freddy\u2019s drop too. Nice from Hassan, a good fast yorker that went under Taylor\u2019s bat. Williamson not looking his chilled, fluent self here. Ominously for whoever they play next, he\u2019s probably nudging himself back into form. 16th over: New Zealand 71-2 (Williamson 24, Taylor 20) Gulbadin looks about. Hmmm. Enter Rahmat Shah, a batsman with a sideline in legspin. Taylor edges his first ball through third man for four. But that is followed by five watchful dots. Well bowled! And that\u2019s drinks. 15th over: New Zealand 67-2 (Williamson 24, Taylor 16) Hamid Hassan returns, just three off the over. Romeo writes again, good to see someone\u2019s out there... Afghanistan need to play more in Britain/Ireland and the kind of conditions there if they\u2019re to be more competitive. Ireland and Scotland, both fine sides in themselves, will welcome them again, no doubt, as they have before, but when will England host them for a proper series? I hope it happens before I die but I\u2019m not confident. Maybe also New Zealand could have them over for a tour? 14th over: New Zealand 64-2 (Williamson 22, Taylor 15) Since the last World Cup, no finger spinner has taken more wickets than Nabi. And New Zealand fail to get him away again. Just three off the over. One of them a frankly terrible run there by Taylor and Williamson which leaves Williamson running to the danger end. But the throw isn\u2019t quite good enough from mid-wicket and he\u2019s safe. 13th over: New Zealand 61-2 (Williamson 21, Taylor 13) Taylor cuts - ooof -he\u2019s strong. A bit short, a bit wide, just how he likes it. Gulbadin is cross with himself. Net bowler hit by David Warner report: his CT scan is fine, and he\u2019s feeling good. He\u2019ll be kept in hospital for observation for a while. 12th over: New Zealand 56-2 (Williamson 21, Taylor 8) We have spin in the body of Mohammad Nabi, Mr Reliability. Sharp haircut; tall, too. Was that last ball the doosra? New Zealand watchful, wary. 11th over: New Zealand 52-2 (Williamson 20, Taylor 6) Gulbadin bustles like few others bustle.Ian Austin perhaps, or Steve Waugh. A maiden. 10th over: New Zealand 52-2 (Williamson 20, Taylor 6) Another super over from Aftab - an lbw appeal against Taylor and a Williamson slice that just falls short of midwicket. In between Taylor slaps a big beautiful pull to the boundary. End of the power play. New Zealand have nine runs fewer and have lost two more wickets than Afghanistan at the same stage. 9th over: New Zealand 46-2 (Williamson 19, Taylor 1) Williamson cracks Gulbadin for four. Two balls later, Gulbadin sends one past Williamson\u2019s outside edge. It doesn\u2019t look out. The 18 year old wicket-keeper looks unconvinced . The umpire says not out. But Gulbadin is sure! Ultra-edge says no, no, no. Gulbadin has now wasted two reviews - one when he was batting, one when he was bowling. There must be a word for that. Rashid Khan news: he will play no further part in the match. A precautionary decision. 8th over: New Zealand 41-2 (Williamson 15, Taylor 0) Is this getting interesting? If one of these two gets out it might be. Silly shot really there from Munro. Aftab only in his second ODI has a double-strike. Munro upper-cuts, but down on the third man boundary Hamid is waiting, and catches it soundly down on his knees. 7th over: New Zealand 39-1 (Williamson 14, Munro 21) Gulbadin takes the ball. No headband here. But the same accuracy. Afghanistan have a slip for Kane Willamson, who then, to the last ball of the over,a fractionally wider one, sways onto the back foot and, head text-bookishly arranged over the bat, drives him away for four. 6th over: New Zealand 34-1 (Williamson 10, Munro 20) A big hand here for Afghanistan\u2019s seamers. Keeping it tight, keeping it on the imaginary tuppence located in that secret bowling sweet spot. Kane Williamson does sneak a boundary, an inside edge, which misses the stumps and carries on its merry way down to the boundary. To Hassan, the honours. 5th over: New Zealand 28-1 (Williamson 6, Munro 19) Aftab\u2019s chain is good and chunky, and only two runs come off that over - working his angles, keeping the batsmen guessing. Romeo writes in, hoping that Rashid Khan will be allowed to rest. I hope they don\u2019t let Rashid come out (in fact I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t). They will miss Dawlat, but Hamid and Aftab will do fine, and Ikram is a proper wicketkeeper and very talented. Game on! 4th over: New Zealand 26-1 (Williamson 5, Munro 18) Hassan, face adorned with black warpaint, headband ready, races in and Munro, foxed, edges him down to third man. But Munro is hungry. To the fifth ball, squarely confident, he drives him square for four. 3rd over: New Zealand 20-1 (Williamson 4, Munro 13) Munro pushes Aftab down the ground with such timing that\u2019s its at the boundary before you can say Quantocks. Williamson then waves Aftab away mid approach, but when the ball finally arrives just lobs him away, content to play his favoured anchor role. 2nd over: New Zealand 14-1 (Williamson 4, Munro 9) A good over from Hassan - just a couple of singles and a wide. Angus Fraser was curious enough to ask about his availability for Middlesex a while ago. Feeling slightly over-full after spending the morning making brownies and the afternoon eating them at my daughter\u2019s club\u2019s fund-raiser. I recommend Mary Berry\u2019s easy receipe. Put it all in a bowl and mix it together. Do let me know what you\u2019ve been up to. 1st over: New Zealand 11-1 (Williamson 2, Munro 0) Munro doesn\u2019t hang about, two fours - a slash though the covers, a power-push down the ground. They\u2019ll laugh off that early wicket - won\u2019t they? News on Rashid Khan after that bang on the helmet. He is not on the field, he\u2019s failed his first concussion test. They\u2019ll give him another one in 45 minutes. The headband warrior gets a breakthrough with the very first ball of the innings! An inside edge onto his pad which loops up to backward point. Taunton is looking gorgeous by the way. Hope the crowd, which looks good on the telly at least, get some thing like a match here. As a county cricket media officer said to me last week, \u201cI like Somerset. A proper club that does things properly.\u201d Ah, here come the players - Guptill and Munro for New Zealand. Everyone\u2019s favourite minnow (are they still minnows?) against everyone\u2019s second team. Aftab Alam takes the first over. Thank you Tim, my first proper boss and how lucky I was! He even paid me a small sum for work experience- back in 1997 - which was unusual to say the least, but just the way it should be. Enough now of the love-in, how about this game? Afghanistan will be disappointed with their final total after being 61-0 off the first ten. But, thanks to that last hit-a-long from Hashmatullah, they have a (small) chance. So long as Rashid Khan isn\u2019t too hurt after being hit on the helmet. News to follow. Pommie Mbangwa is looking at the pitch. He thinks the New Zealanders will enjoy themselves here. Ian Smith, Simon Doull and Mark Nicholas are all in matching blue suits, some, it has to be said, cut tighter than others. That was a strange innings. What\u2019s the Afghan idiom for the curate\u2019s egg? They started superbly, racing to 66-0 off 64 balls as Hazratullah roared and Noor Ali purred. Then they collapsed, perhaps on the basis of when in England, do as the English do. But in between the showers they showed some fight, even though the pitch had quickened up and the New Zealanders were suddenly fancying themselves as the West Indians of the Seventies. Jimmy Neesham picked up a five-for, though to my eye Lockie Ferguson was even better. One of these days, we will realise that NZ should be right up there among the favourites for this World Cup. That\u2019s it from me \u2013 it\u2019ll be Tanya Aldred, The Guardian\u2019s queen of the county scene, to see you through. I remember when she was just the work-experience kid at Wisden. Thanks for your company, your emails, and your geological bibliography. That\u2019s that! Hashmatullah has a flail at Ferguson, whose pace carries the ball to third man, where Henry takes a sharp tumbling catch as his shades fly off towards fine leg. So Hashmatullah finally departs for 59 off 99 balls, Ferguson has 4 for 37, and NZ have to get 173 to maintain their 100-per-cent record. It should be a cakewalk, but you never know. \u201cThere is no Afghan commentator on the ICC/Sunset+Vine roster,\u201d says Romeo, darkly. \u201cWhy not? Every other team has at least one and many have loads. There is something wrong here.\u201d 41st over: Afghanistan 172-9 (Hashmatullah 59, Hassan 7) Hashmatullah has been shepherding Hassan, shielding him from the strike and giving him little lectures, but now he leaves him to face five balls from Boult and Hassan is up to the task. 40th over: Afghanistan 171-9 (Hashmatullah 58, Hassan 7) Against the odds, these two are hanging in there. Edmund King has waited two hours for an answer to his question about geology books (15:22), but then what\u2019s two hours in 66 million years? And now we have one. \u201cMy wife still has a few geology/Earth Sciences books from her student days, which I\u2019ve dug out,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cThey are fairly dated by now\u201d \u2013 is that a joke? \u2013 \u201cbut there might be later editions: 1) The Story of the Earth by Patrick Moore and Peter Cattermole; 2) The Inacessible Earth by G. C. Brown and A.E. Mussett; 3) Mineralogy for students by M.H. Battey. Good fossicking!\u201d I\u2019m just wondering which one you\u2019ve made up. 39th over: Afghanistan 168-9 (Hashmatullah 56, Hassan 6) A few dots, and then Hashmatullah spots Boult\u2019s yorker, actually a full toss, and plays a very classy clip to deep square leg\u2019s right. That went off the bat so fast that you rather fear for the Afghanis if Guptill gets going. 38th over: Afghanistan 163-9 (Hashmatullah 51, Hassan 6) Ferguson tries a yorker and Hashmatullah is equal to it, digging it out so well that he gets four to long-on, and completing a fine fighting fifty off 84 balls. It\u2019s largely thanks to him that Afghanistan are still out there. 37th over: Afghanistan 158-9 (Hashmatullah 46, Hassan 6) While all this has been happening, Hashmatullah has been up the other end, like a teenager at a wedding, lurking in the corner and hoping you won\u2019t realise that he\u2019s there with his parents. Facing Boult, he picks up four off a top-edged hook. 36th over: Afghanistan 153-9 (Hashmatullah 41, Hassan 6) Do Afghanistan bat all the way down? Hamid Hassan comes in, plays a very classy on-drive for four, and moves to six off two balls. For the Afghanis, it\u2019s a funny young game. \u201cAfghan Harrow cut?\u201d wonders Peter Rowntree. \u201cHow about a Kyber chop?\u201d Nice one. Live by the slog, die by the slog. Aftab slaps a short ball into the clouds and Tom Latham does a good job of motoring into no-man\u2019s-land, waiting several minutes, and not letting the ball bounce out of his gloves as it returns to earth\u2019s orbit. 35th over: Afghanistan 139-8 (Hashmatullah 41, Aftab 6) Aftab is approaching the task the way Darren Gough once did, as if the crowd had all come to see him bat. Sometimes he even connects with the ball. Meanwhile, in Cardiff, England have taken a couple of quick wickets, but Shakib al Hasan has a hundred. 34th over: Afghanistan 135-8 (Hashmatullah 39, Aftab 4) Some defiance is needed and Aftab Alam provides it, stepping away to blast Ferguson through the covers. Off one ball, Aftab scores twice as many runs as Ikram managed in 22, which rather makes you wonder what Ikram was doing at No.8. That\u2019s a nasty blow in more than one sense. A length ball from Ferguson reared up at Rashid, hitting him on the grille and then ricocheting into the stumps. He stops ten yards into the long walk off, clearly feeling groggy. Hope he\u2019s OK \u2013 it\u2019s been a bad day for it, with the net bowler hit by a shot from David Warner earlier. And that\u2019s drinks, with poor Afghanistan reeling. 33rd over: Afghanistan 130-7 (Hashmatullah 38, Rashid Khan 0) Rashid can bat, which is lucky because Afghanistan could do with another hundred here. Ikram finally locates the middle of his bat, and it\u2019s the end of him. A full ball outside off, a decent connection but a touch late on it, and a simple catch at backward point. He was adhesive while he lasted, helping Hashmatullah add 21 off 52 balls. 32nd over: Afghanistan 130-6 (Hashmatullah 38, Ikram 2) Ikram gets another run! And it\u2019s another edge, but very different \u2013 he aimed into the covers, it went towards mid-on, and he scuttled through for a rather risky single. 31st over: Afghanistan 129-6 (Hashmatullah 38, Ikram 1) Ikram is off the mark! With an edge! That was dropped! By Taylor at slip, tipping it over the bar. 30th over: Afghanistan 127-6 (Hashmatullah 37, Ikram 0) Neesham\u2019s looking for a sixth scalp, and even Hashmatullah can see that the thing to do is just to keep him out. Neesham finishes with 10-1-31-5 after grabbing a wicket in each of his first three overs and a couple more in his seventh \u2013 he even had time for a wobble in the middle. Those are the best figures of his professional career, never mind international. 29th over: Afghanistan 126-6 (Hashmatullah 36, Ikram 0) Nearly another one as Hashmatullah inside-edges Henry past his leg stump. Anybody know the Afghani expression for Harrow cut? 28th over: Afghanistan 121-6 (Hashmatullah 31, Ikram 0) Yet another one-run over, from Neesham. Ikram has now survived nine balls, mostly by swaying out of the line. \u201cG\u2019day Tim.\u201d G\u2019day Geoff Lemon, Guardian contributor and winner of the Wisden Book of the Year award. \u201cAdam [Collins] and I had a really interesting interview with Neesham a few days ago, where he talked about having been a perfectionist to the point that he came to hate cricket. And now having changed that to just enjoying what he does, so he can relax. Could be worth linking to given his five-for.\u201d 27th over: Afghanistan 120-6 (Hashmatullah 30, Ikram 0) That\u2019s better! Matt Henry returns and Hashmatullah slaps him through the covers for a handsome four. Abhijato answers my question [15:51], which presumably means it\u2019s no longer rhetorical. \u201cAs it turns out to be,\u201d he says, \u201cI\u2019m a sixteen year old student living in Kolkata, India. Courtesy BCCI and its control over the schedule (not that I encourage it), all the day World Cup matches start at 3pm in my timezone, so I can follow the OBOs even as I oversleep every morning (source: Mother). Courtesy my school, the summer vacation has been going on for almost a month now, leaving me plenty of free time after I distribute my study and assignment completion hours throughout the day to accommodate this cricket-watching schedule. My school will reopen from next Monday, hence curtailing my future participation in your live coverage. Hope to send in emails time-to-time anyways!\u201d My hunch is you\u2019ll manage it. There\u2019s a whole world in that paragraph. 26th over: Afghanistan 115-6 (Hashmatullah 25, Ikram 0) Hashmatullah can\u2019t resist a waft at Neesham, which connects only with thin air. He\u2019s carrying the hopes of a nation here and he needs to stick around for at least an hour. 25th over: Afghanistan 114-6 (Hashmatullah 24, Ikram 0) Out comes Ikram Alikhil, who is 18 and only just off the plane. As a teenager with jetlag, he\u2019s got to be grateful that this is a day-nighter. He\u2019s sufficiently awake to keep out a yorker from Trent Boult, and then to arch back and evade a lifter. No runs yet, but two feathers in his cap already. 24th over: Afghanistan 109-6 (Hashmatullah 19, Ikram 0) Neesham, so good in his first spell, was only middling in his second until that over, but now he has the formidable figures of 7-1-28-5. And another! A better ball from Neesham, who finds steep lift in the corridor, and that\u2019s a five-for. Just when they were eyeing respectability, Afghanistan slip back into the mire. Nabi tries a dab off Neesham, misjudges the bounce and presents Latham with the simplest of catches. 23rd over: Afghanistan 100-4 (Nabi 9, Hashmatullah 14) After a 27-minute break, the players are back on the field. Trent Boult is bowling, two balls into his second spell: he completes an over that goes for just a single. Apparently it\u2019s still a 50-over match, which may not play to Afghanistan\u2019s strengths any more than this blustery day. Play will resume at 4.05pm, in five minutes, according to our friends at Cricinfo. The same wind that is blowing the rain in and out at Taunton is making its presence felt at Cardiff, where CricViz noted a short time ago that 96 per cent of Jofra Archer\u2019s deliveries had been clocked at 140kph. He\u2019s off now, but Mark Wood is on, which is a fine example of the fire giving way to the frying pan. More on Afghanistan\u2019s game plan. \u201cJames Wrout [15:24] is nine-tenths right,\u201d says Romeo, \u201cbut Afghanistan\u2019s young players are used to much shorter games where it\u2019s six or miss (or out). Hazrat first played with a hard ball only six years ago, and the tape-ball game the youngsters in Afghanistan play is usually ten overs per innings. As Hazrat says, you have to go for a six every ball. It\u2019ll take a while for them to get into the habit of not getting out, but there are players who can do this.\u201d An email for anyone who was watching children\u2019s telly in Britain in about 1971. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the occasional aerial view of the village of Trumpton,\u201d says Alistair Connor. \u201c\u2018This is the clock... The Taunton clock...\u2019 It\u2019s a bit niche, but frankly Taunton doesn\u2019t ring any other bells for me, and I\u2019ve driven through it at least once. \u2018Pugh, Pugh, Barney McGrew, Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb\u2019 are presumably the backbone of the local XI?\u201d Ha. \u201cA message of optimism,\u201d declares Abhijato Sensarma. Where are you, Abhi, and do you ever sleep? \u201cAfghanistan are scoring at round 4.50 rpo. They might have lost wickets but they have surprising batting depth, with a majestically wristy Rashid coming in only at number eight! Rather than taking risks, the conditions are helpful enough to let them peacefully knock the ball around. If they manage to get a score in excess of 240+, panic can easily set in for the Kiwis. They\u2019re known to start too slowly and rely too much on Ross Taylor and/or the lower middle order rescuing them, especially during chases. If the spinners can keep their act together while eking out a few wickets too, something special could indeed take place. The thriller is still afoot!\u201d Full marks for positivity, but I\u2019d like to see you tell Martin Guptill he\u2019s a slow starter. Where\u2019s Annie Lennox when you need her? The PA goes for Prince instead. 22nd over: Afghanistan 99-4 (Nabi 9, Hashmatullah 13) Another good over for Afghanistan as Nabi cuts for a measured two and Neesham, straying onto the pads, throws in four leg byes. This partnership is 29 off eight overs, and worth twice that in the circumstances. 21st over: Afghanistan 90-4 (Nabi 7, Hashmatullah 12) We\u2019re back, de Grandhomme is still on, and Hashmatullah is in the mood, hitting a majestic cover drive. Officially, no time has been lost, so it\u2019s still a 50-over match, in theory. James Wrout is back for more. \u201cI think my two favourite teams (Afg and WI) both suffer from the same deficiency,\u201d he sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s either dots or fours. I wish they could turn the strike over more often, like India and England do. I\u2019m no tactical genius, so the coaches are probably ahead of me with this idea. What a shame it hasn\u2019t sunk in yet.\u201d Play will resume at 3.30, in about ten minutes, assuming the weather doesn\u2019t do another about-turn. That\u2019s Afghanistan\u2019s job. \u201cA slow accumulation of strata,\u201d says an email subject line. Edmund King, you know how to leave the reader wanting more. \u201cI can\u2019t help feeling that this game, with its slow accumulations of scoring, its occasional sudden unconformities, and now the steady drift of wind and rain across the landscape, feels very geological. Or perhaps I\u2019m projecting. I\u2019ve spent much of the last week wandering the coastal paths around Berwick and have become obsessed with the Lower Carboniferous, which is a turn of events I did not see coming. Does anyone out there have any recommendations for books that can be read by someone who knows little about British rocks and landforms, but would like to learn?\u201d Edmund is right to assume that that question needs to go over my head. But I do know one thing about geology, after getting into a chat with a geologist at a college reunion. \u201cGeology,\u201d she told me, \u201cis everything over 66 million years old. The rest is gardening.\u201d Guess what? The sun is now shining. The umps are in the middle, showing off their scarlet anoraks. It\u2019s now raining hard \u2013 \u201cstair rods!\u201d according to Mark Nicholas \u2013 so you have permission to follow the action elsewhere, as long as you stay with The Guardian. Djokovic is out! And England\u2019s seamers, of whom there are five today, have started solidly against Bangladesh. 20th over: Afghanistan 84-4 (Nabi 6, Hashmatullah 7) Neesham continues, but maybe that change of ends was a mistake. Nabi lofts him for what feels like four or six all the way, only for the ball to stop in the soggy turf. And now they\u2019re off for rain. Pity, but the wind should send it on its way fairly soon. 19th over: Afghanistan 79-4 (Nabi 3, Hashmatullah 6) Is the nightmare over? We can but hope, as there\u2019s a single or two and even a cut for four, by Hashmatullah off de Grandhomme. What Ferguson has done to be taken off is not quite clear. A few captains in this World Cup seem to be playing by the usual conventions rather than going for the kill \u2013 Jason Holder did it against Australia, taking Oshane Thomas off when he was on fire, and it probably cost them the match. \u201cHow\u2019s the OBO?\u201d wonders my colleague Emma John. \u201cI\u2019m covering the game in Taunton. I think you\u2019d really like the playlist they\u2019ve got on the PA down here at Taunton. It\u2019s pretty indie. At the end of the first over I heard the words \u2018Barbra Streis-end\u2019 over the tannoy and thought maybe the ICC had renamed the ends as well as the grounds. Then I realised they were playing Duck Sauce.\u201d 18th over: Afghanistan 72-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 1) Now we see why Neesham went off \u2013 he was just changing ends, having clearly decided that he could do better than snapping up three quick wickets. That\u2019s another maiden. Off the last 44 balls, Afghanistan have amassed 6 for 4. 17th over: Afghanistan 72-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 1) Not much happening in this over, apart from two oddities. A bowler with three for 10 is taken off, as Neesham gives way to de Grandhomme. And a batsman, Hashmatullah, gets off the mark from his 20th ball. 16th over: Afghanistan 71-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 0) Yet another maiden from Ferguson. This has turned into a Test match, with slips and leg slips. And it\u2019s not a form of the game that the Afghanis are used to. If you\u2019ve ever felt like emailing the OBO, now\u2019s your chance. 15th over: Afghanistan 71-4 (Nabi 1, Hashmatullah 0) Slight pause there while I called Tanya Aldred to warn her that this innings may not go the distance. She was at the cricket in a way \u2013 a fund-raising afternoon for her daughter\u2019s team. Something to do with forgetting the prizes for the raffle: proper creekit. Now come on Afghanistan, dig in for a few overs. If Ultra Edge was a person, it might decide, in the interests of a proper day out for the crowd, that there was no edge. But it\u2019s not, so Gulbadin has to go. And that\u2019s drinks, with a dream start for Afghanistan turning into a nightmare. Gulbadin is given caught behind, slashing at a wide one from Neesham, and he\u2019s looking for a reprieve, possibly out of sheer desperation. 14th over: Afghanistan 70-3 (Gulbadin 4, Hashmatullah 0) Another maiden from Ferguson, who now has the improbable figures of 3-2-9-1. He would have been right at home in the first World Cup, 44 years ago. 13th over: Afghanistan 70-3 (Gulbadin 4, Hashmatullah 0) The captain, Gulbadin, has had enough of this nonsense: he sees a short one so early that his pull goes straight back past Neesham. But before that we had three wickets for no runs in the space of 11 balls. After a terrific powerplay, the wheels have come off. Another one! Oh dear. Rahmat sees something juicy on his legs, only to get a leading edge and present Guptill at gully with the easiest of catches. This game has spun through 180 degrees in about five minutes. 12th over: Afghanistan 66-2 (Rahmat 0, Hashmatullah 0) Ferguson, who earned the wicket with his extra bounce, completes a wicket-maiden with a 91mph bat-beater outside off. Hashmatullah did well not to hit that. Meanwhile, in Cardiff, England have made the highest score of this World Cup, and their own highest in World Cup history. See what Rob Smyth made of it here. Nooooooooor! A bouncer from Ferguson, a tickle or a glove, a catch behind, and the end of the classiest 31 you\u2019ll ever see. 11th over: Afghanistan 66-1 (Noor Ali 31, Rahmat 0) Now they\u2019ve seen off Henry too (5-0-38-0). Jimmy Neesham enters the fray and there\u2019s more sumptuousness from Noor Ali, who off-drives like a star. But then Neesham strikes as Hazrat gets a bit carried away with his own stroke-making. I got ahead of myself there and so did Hazrat, who scoops a square something and picks out Munro at deep point. Shame. 10th over: Afghanistan 61-0 (Hazratullah 34, Noor Ali 26) Another little victory for Afghanistan: they\u2019ve seen off Trent Boult, who was testing as usual (4-0-13-0). Lockie Ferguson comes on, bringing a gift for Hazrat, who leg-glances for four. And then Noor spots a full one and crunches it away with a square drive to round off the powerplay in style. \u201cTeacher\u2019s pest,\u201d is how Brian Withington begins his latest. \u201cAs someone perhaps guilty of sticking his hand up rather too often, might I be permitted a further observation?\u201d Oh, go on then. \u201cIt sounds like a cracking day for competitive kite flying between innings - where you attempt to cut the opposition string and then chase after the downed kite. I believe it\u2019s a very big deal in Afghanistan.\u201d 9th over: Afghanistan 51-0 (Hazratullah 30, Noor Ali 21) Hazrat\u2019s policy of going aerial finally pays off with swivel for six off Henry. And then he tries an orthodox cricket shot, with a rasping cut for four. That\u2019s fifty up, and a big boost for Afghanistan \u2013 their best opening stand for ages. \u201cI have a feeling about this game,\u201d says Romeo. \u201cWith Noor Ali in and Rahmat to come, there will be backbone for the hitters to bat around. I hope I feel the same later on. I\u2019ve been following Afghan cricket for years now and even flew for four hours to see them at Lord\u2019s against MCC. I think there\u2019s a bit of disinformation floating around about Asghar: as I understand it, he has an injury (could be wrong). In any event, AfghanAtalan!\u201d 8th over: Afghanistan 39-0 (Hazratullah 19, Noor Ali 20) The better Noor plays, the worse Hazrat gets. He wafts at Boult and is dropped by Ross Taylor at first slip. It was a tough one, fast and high. Here\u2019s a rather irate email. \u201cThis is NOT a minor match, Tim.\u201d OK... \u201cApart from the futile pleasure of seeing NZ at the top of the points table for as long as possible, it\u2019s all about the glorious stealth march to the semis. They looked a bit genteel against Sri Lanka, they need to learn to put the boot in. England and India seem nailed on for the semis, and in spite of my moral obligation to think the worst of Australia, they are looking good too. \u201cSo. Rendezvous at Old Trafford on the 22nd, for the quarter-final against West Indies \u2013 as it happens my mate Stanley from Trinidad has got us tickets.\u201d 7th over: Afghanistan 37-0 (Hazratullah 18, Noor Ali 19) Noor has now decided to be Greg Chappell. He plays the shot of the day, an on-drive with a flick of the wrist. \u201cThree exquisite shots from Noor Ali,\u201d says a Kiwi voice. \u201cSorry if I missed something,\u201d says a very polite James Wrout, \u201cbut has there been any explanation for Mo Shahzad not playing? Dropped? Injured? Important lunch appointment?\u201d Ha. It\u2019s a knee injury, bad enough to rule him out of the rest of the World Cup. Big moment for his understudy, Ikram Alikhil, who was born this century \u2013 he\u2019s 18, and already has a Test cap in his backpack. 6th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 18, Noor Ali 15) Boult tries a wide yorker to Noor, who reaches it on the full and straight-drives, again, for four. You may reach for the sky, he\u2019s telling Hazrat, but I\u2019ll keep my feats on the ground. 5th over: Afghanistan 27-0 (Hazratullah 17, Noor Ali 10) A lovely straight drive from Noor, and then the Afghanis throw classicism to the wind. Hazrat sends a skyer to deep midwicket, where two fielders converge without getting a hand on it. Then he hits the ball even higher, and three men pile in, including de Grandhomme, who drops it. 4th over: Afghanistan 19-0 (Hazratullah 14, Noor Ali 5) Another tight over, from Boult, who does appeal for LBW against Hazrat. It\u2019s not given and Boult doesn\u2019t review, wisely, as it was leg-stump-ish and there was an inside edge. Meanwhile there\u2019s been an alarming incident in the nets at the Oval, where an unnamed bowler was hit on the head by a stroke from David Warner. 3rd over: Afghanistan 18-0 (Hazratullah 14, Noor Ali 4) Hazrat slugs Henry to leg and almost picks out the man at deep midwicket, but it would only be a problem if they were playing one-hand-one-bounce. Henry restores order, helped by some sharp fielding by Santner. There\u2019s a roaring wind, better for the Afghan flag-wavers than for the bowlers. 2nd over: Afghanistan 16-0 (Hazratullah 13, Noor Ali 3) At the other end it\u2019s Trent Boult, ranked No.2 in the world. He finds some swing and is half-way to appealing for LBW when Noor Ali jabs down with a leading edge. In the scorebook, it will look perfectly fine, as it goes for two. 1st over: Afghanistan 12-0 (Hazratullah 12, Noor Ali 0) Matt Henry is having a great tournament already, but being a New Zealander, he has gone widely unnoticed. He tries an early bouncer, which Hazratullah hooks nicely. Henry bites back, drawing the edge, but that goes for four too. And then Hazrat swats another four past midwicket. Henry again responds, beating the bat. We have a contest already. Do send in an email if you feel like it, especially (at the risk of sounding like a teacher) if you don\u2019t usually put your hand up. I\u2019d love to know what you think, where you are and what else you\u2019re up to today. \u201cHow,\u201d asks Andrew Harrison, \u201cdo you think Afghanistan will react to the disappointment of their last game? Is there much chance they can pull off an upset here?\u201d Well, most of them have dealt with bigger disappointments, so yes, there is a chance, but it\u2019s slim, and it got a little slimmer when Kane Williamson won the toss. The pitch looks a touch green, but Taunton is usually full of runs and Afghanistan probably need 250 to make a game of it. It was 20 years ago today (plus a fortnight), Sgt Sourav told the band to play. The last time Taunton hosted a men\u2019s ODI was at the 1999 World Cup, when India played Sri Lanka. The day is remembered for one thing \u2013 a stand of 318 by Ganguly and Rahul Dravid. It ought to be known for something else too: being a first taste of ODI cricket for a Somerset boy called Jos Buttler, who went along as a spectator, aged eight, and formed the impression that you are supposed to hit the ball out of the ground \u2013 something he\u2019s just done, for the millionth time, in Cardiff. \u201cWould\u2019ve liked NZ to bat,\u201d says Joachim Suggate, \u201cand see what kind of total they could put up.\u201d Amen to that, but maybe Afghanistan can catch them under the lights, which are brand new and therefore liable to go wrong. Is this an email I see before me? \u201cAnyone for Porter?\u201d asks Brian Withington, spotting my source for the last line of the preamble. \u201cAfternoon Tim. Showing an early glimpse of stocking? God that man knew how to write a lyric ...\u201d He did. But let\u2019s face it, if he was starting out today, he\u2019d be writing for the OBO. One team is unchanged, and you can probably guess which. Afghanistan 1 Hazratullah, 2 Noor Ali, 3 Rahmat Shah, 4 Hashmatullah, 5 Nabi, 6 Gulbadin (capt), 7 Najibullah, 8 Ikram Alikhil (wkt), 9 Rashid Khan, 10 Aftab Alam, 11 Hamid Hassan. NZ 1 Guptill, 2 Munro, 3 Williamson (capt), 4 Taylor, 5 Latham (wkt), 6 Neesham, 7 de Grandhomme, 8 Santner, 9 Henry, 10 Ferguson, 11 Boult. Great for the leaders, not so good for the game. Afternoon everyone. (Anyone?) This is the game for you if you support New Zealand, have a soft spot for Afghanistan, can\u2019t abide England or like a bit of novelty. These two teams have only ever met once in one-day internationals, in the last World Cup, when Daniel Vettori made sure it wasn\u2019t much of a contest. But that was in Napier, where I suspect there weren\u2019t many Afghanistan supporters. Today, in Taunton, at the weekend, the cheers should be more evenly distributed. The New Zealanders are top of the table with two wins out of two and a commanding net run rate, but they\u2019ve had a relatively gentle start (Sri Lanka and Bangladesh). Afghanistan have lost to Australia and, more painfully, to Sri Lanka, but they\u2019re spirited and skilful and will surely rattle one of the big teams in this World Cup. Today would be a great time to do it, as it would prove, with four weeks of the round robin still to come, that these days, heaven knows, anything goes. Play starts at 1.30pm BST and the forecast is for sunny spells.",

      "bodyText": "Amjad Farekh\u2019s shops had survived Syria\u2019s long civil war, but not the new, unsteady peace that has settled in some parts of the country. The government recently blew up several properties in the industrial zone of Qaboun, a former opposition stronghold just outside the capital, the exiled businessman said. The destruction and loss echoed dozens of other clearance operations around the country documented by activists and analysts, who say they see a worrying pattern. They fear the government is taking advantage of the messy aftermath of war to tighten its grip on towns and cities, targeting neighbourhoods and communities that rose up against President Bashar al-Assad for demolition, under the guise of military clearance operations. Between September and December of 2018, a report for the European Institute of Peace thinktank tracked government announcements of 344 explosions, ostensibly to clear the aftermath of war. \u201cEach gave reasons such as \u2018conducting a bombing\u2019 or \u2018to detonate tunnels headquarters, explosive devices and ammunition of terrorist organisations\u2019,\u201d the unpublished report said. \u201cHowever \u2026 these explosions are instead targeting and destroying housing stock.\u201d The analysis was based on satellite imagery, open source video and photo imagery, and the Syrian government\u2019s own tweets. In one cited for Qaboun, the Ministry of Defence gave notice last November that it would be clearing \u201cexplosive remnants of terrorists\u201d. Residents filmed the demolition of an apartment block, the \u201cTeachers Towers\u201d, by military engineers. These kinds of demolition are happening on a \u201cnear-daily\u201d basis, the report said, \u201cusing a variety of rationales, including the extensive property damage [the government] wrought on properties with their indiscriminate bombing\u201d. The loss of homes and properties risks stranding millions of refugees in limbo abroad, including those who might have considered returning home as the eight-year civil war winds down. More than 12 million Syrians fled their homes, 5.6 million leaving the country and 6.6 million others displaced internally, many going because they were opposition supporters or sympathisers. Assad has urged refugees to come home and promised that those who are \u201chonest\u201d would be forgiven for opposing him, but hundreds have been arrested on return, many tortured, and others conscripted despite promises that they would not be, or harassed in the streets. His government has also used housing laws, including 45 new pieces of legislation passed during the conflict, to seize the property of rebel supporters , fracturing communities that opposed him. \u201cDespite a limited amount of public rhetoric about Syrians being welcome to return home, Assad does not actually want the majority of the Syrian population currently displaced inside and outside the country to return,\u201d said Emma Beals, an independent analyst researching refugee return in Syria. \u201cThis is demonstrated in many ways, such as the arrest and harassment of large numbers of returnees, as well as by using a framework for reconstruction that ensures the displaced cannot return to their properties. \u201cSyria\u2019s displaced state a desire to return to their own houses, towns, and cities, and the government know that by depriving them of this right they decrease the chance that they will ever go home.\u201d One of those displaced is Amjad Farekh. Before the war his family owned land and several properties in Qaboun, but have been left with almost nothing. \u201cNow even though we are property owners we can\u2019t go back to our home areas because the regime will arrest us, so our properties have no value. Many people I know had to sell their properties at half price,\u201d he said. Authorities seized land and one building for use during the war as a military base. Like many refugees, the family don\u2019t have the key papers they would need to seek compensation or reclaim surviving properties, but they can\u2019t go back to Syria to replace them. Nine out of 10 Syrian refugees are missing at least one key identification document, and fewer than one in five have property records, research by the Norwegian Refugee Council has found. Syria already had serious housing issues before the civil war; they contributed to the build-up of tensions \u2013 along with drought, economic stagnation and political repression among other factors \u2013 that exploded into conflict in 2011. For decades development had not kept pace with a flood of villagers moving to cities. Many settled into \u201cinformal\u201d housing developments, often without documentation of their ownership. Marginalised in the pre-war economy, residents of these areas often supported the uprising against Assad. That means many saw intense fighting in the earlier stages of the war, and were at least partly emptied of their original residents. It may also have contributed to a high rate of dispossession among Syrian refugees, with housing seized when opposition supporters left, or in the years that followed. \u201cWhen we left Aleppo, the pro-regime forces confiscated all my family\u2019s properties and moved into our houses,\u201d said Abdulkareem al-Halabi, an exiled reporter for the Baladi news website. \u201cRecently former neighbours told us that a building where we owned an apartment is being sold in an auction.\u201d The Carnegie Middle East centre found that half of the refugees in Jordan and two-thirds in Lebanon reported their property was damaged or destroyed. There is no question that reconstruction is desperately needed after years of brutal conflict. Overall more than a third of the country\u2019s housing stock had been affected, the World Bank estimated in 2017, and for even a fraction of displaced Syrians to come home more housing must be built or rebuilt. But civil society groups fear Assad plans to use reconstruction to further dispossess his opponents, and break up their strongholds. The government has a history of weaponised housing throughout the conflict. Human Rights Watch has documented demolitions of property starting in 2012, and as fighting raged the new laws covering property were passed. Together they give the government sweeping powers to requisition land and property and re-zone it for new development, but perhaps the most controversial is known as law 10. It was alarming enough to cause international outrage. Western countries have so far refused to provide funding for rebuilding, saying there will be no cash without political transition, but Syrian authorities are looking instead to private funding, which would allow them to sweep humanitarian concerns aside. The Syrian Association for Citizens\u2019 Dignity, an organisation that represents the displaced, has called for greater pressure from the international community. \u201cPreservation of property rights and right of Syrians to safe and dignified voluntary return must be considered an urgent issue that needs firm action,\u201d the group said.",

The Four Seasons opened in 1959, inside the Park Avenue skyscraper built by the Bauhaus architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The architect Philip Johnson was responsible for the dazzling restaurant interior, in which he was often to be found.

A Mark Rothko mural series commissioned for the restaurant ended up housed in Tate Modern in London. The Four Seasons served good food but most reviewers came to think the menu was never really the point of a restaurant which became a stage for the high, the mighty and, after a meal and drinks, the mightily high.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s the report from Le Havre ... Alternatively, Scotland are playing Cyprus with Scott Murray helming the commentary: For more Women\u2019s World Cup football, join Ben Fisher for Norway v Nigeria: Anyway ... that\u2019s all from me. Until we meet again for we can only hope is a better game. The report is on its way ... South Africa wilted in the second half, which was easy to see, suffering after a long periods of dogged defending. Spain will really need to up their game if they are to compete in this tournament, that\u2019s for sure. Lucia Garcia will certainly be starting their next game. South Africa come out of this game with more credit than Spain despite the result, which leaves the victors top of the group. Spain were generally woeful in the final third, relying on two penalties to move ahead. Lucia Garcia\u2019s energy after the break was key to victory, stretching the South Africa defence and she deserved her goal. South Africa scored the goal of the game and will be left to wonder what might have happened if Kgatlana had put them two goals ahead with the goal gaping in the second half. 90+3 mins: Spain are now just toying with South Africa, knocking it around and dribbling past them. Lucia Garcia almost gets a second when Hermoso backheels the ball through to her teammate but her shot from close range is blocked by the committed Seoposenwe. 90+1 mins: Five minutes added on here, just drag this is out. A ball over the top finds Garcia who controls it, knocks it round on the onrushing goalkeeper, who then collides woth a defender, allowing the Athletic Bilbao player to knock the ball into an empty net. 87 mins: Hermoso swings in a corner from the right but everyone misses it, the ball pinballs around and South Africa eventually whack it clear. Matlou goes down with a head injury after clashing in the box but she seems fine to continue. 85 mins: Hmmm ... obviously it was all pretty nasty from Vilakazi, as she caught Lucia Garcia high up but I am sure how you can definitively say it was deliberate. This is all a bit harsh on South Africa. Spain winning this thanks to two penalties would sum up how miserable they\u2019ve been in the final third. It is Hermoso again. A gentle walk to the spot ends with the striker placing the ball into the corner beyond the goalkeeper who went the right way. 81 mins: If you like last-ditch defending the final minutes here in Le Havre are for you, with South Africa putting bodies on the line. Hermoso lifts a cross to the back post where Caldentey can\u2019t control the ball and it is cleared. We\u2019re off to VAR ... the claim is Vilakazi fouled Lucia Garcia when following through with a clearance. Her studs land on the thigh of the attacker and the penalty is given. Vilakazi is sent off for a second bookable offence. Not sure how the referee could judge that it was deliberate. 79 mins: It\u2019s been all Spain since the goal and they really need to start with a win here, as it\u2019s a tough group with Germany and China in it, too. Spain are popping it round a lot quicker here. A pass is lifted over the defence to Lucia Garcia but she is miles off as the Athletic Bilbao forward volleys at the goalkeeper. 77 mins: Biyana is cautioned for a late challenge on Lucia Garcia. 74 mins: NO GOAL! The ball is lumped into the box and Torrecilla beats the goalkeeper to it, flicking it into an empty net but the Spaniard is just offside, with the flag going up immediately. We do not even require VAR. How efficient. 72 mins: It\u2019s all about an \u201cunnatural position of the hand\u201d under the new guidelines. I must say, we\u2019re going get a lot of penalties if that\u2019s the case. Spain\u2019s spirit seems to have improved now they\u2019re back on level terms. Caldentey finds herself in space but her shot from inside the box is blocked and cleared. A penalty to Spain after Van Wyk is adjudged to have handballed it. Her arm was up when Hermoso chipped it into the box and it hits the South African defenders elbow and she is subsequently booked. A bit harsh but the arm was up. What a shame. Hermoso steps up and calmly slots the ball to the left as the goalkeeper goes the other way. 67 mins: A Spain corner is slung in from the left, it is won by Paredes but her header from 10 yards out bounces meekly wide. Something has gone to VAR ... for a handball and a penalty to Spain but it turns out nothing happened. Cheers everyone. 65 mins: Dlamini has spent the day doing catching practice whether it is from poor long shots or miserable crosses. She bowls out the latest failed pass to Vilakazi who naturally lumps it long and Spain clear for a throw. 63 mins: Some confusion at the back for South Africa as Van Wyk delays her clearance while under pressure from a striker, kicking the ball against her own teammate but it conveniently bounces into the goalkeeper\u2019s arms. 61 mins: The first booking of the day goes to Vilakazi after she catches Garcia in the face. It didn\u2019t look like there was much in it but hey ho. Hermoso lines up the free-kick and lumps it into the box but it bounces straight out of play as Putellas fails to control the ball. 59 mins: Spain are trying to spread the play a lot more, with a number of crossfield passes already sent from one side to the other, with little success. Garcia wins a corner for Spain after her cross is deflected behind. As usual, it comes to nothing. 57 mins: South Africa should have a second after great play down the right results in a cross which squirms its way through to Kgatlana but she fluffs her links with a weak shot straight at Panos who repels it and the dawdling Spanish defence just about clear their lines. Mthandi is replaced by Seoposenwe. 55 mins: Torrejon reads the cross from the left and finds space but her header is straight at Dlamini. She really should do better in positions like that. 53 mins: South Africa going more defensive now with the substitution made. Will that be enough to stem the flow in the middle of the park? Mthandi has a dig from long distance but it flies well wide. 51 mins: Leon brings the ball out from the back to start an attack, it ends with Caldentey in the area but her shot is straight at the goalkeeper. Ndimeni comes on for Motlhalo for South Africa. 49 mins: It\u2019s all being played in Spain\u2019s final third. Hermoso wriggles to find room on the edge of the box but her shot is blocked and then Garcia whacks one high and wide. I think we might be seeing plenty action like this. 47 mins: The early stages of this half reflect the opening 45 minutes as Spain dominate possession. They hit the bar as Hermoso lobs one onto the woodwork and then the offside flag goes up to save South Africa from further danger. Spain looking more dangerous already. Kick-off! Here we go again! Spain have a simple answer to their issues and that\u2019s a double substitution. Garc\u00eda and Bonmat\u00ed are on, with Losada and Sampedro making way. Spain need to improve here and be far more incisive to bring themselves back into it. For your half-time reading ... a bit of a chat with Phil Neville An interview with Scotland striker Jane Ross ... Bryan Armen Graham speaks to Crystal Dunn ... Fiona Brown talks to the Guardian ... This is what happened in the first game of the day ... Well ... no one saw that coming. Frankly, Spain have been utterly dominant as the possession stats show. The one moment of really quality in the final third resulted in a goal and we will be wanting more of that in the second half. Spain have been uninspiring in attack, which is the main reason they\u2019re behind at the break. 45 mins: Kgatlana lifts a cross into the box but Leon wins the header ahead of the attacker to remove the danger. Three minutes added on. 43 mins: Hermoso is felled and takes a while to get up after holding her ankle. Losada once again is tasked with whipping in the set-piece and for the first time it is a dangerous one but it does not matter as South Africa head it clear. Here is the goal from earlier: 41 mins: Correderra slips a pass through for Caldentay to latch onto but her cross is poor and easily to clear. South Africa take the opportunity to break but it breaks down on the right flank as Spain get numbers back. 39 mins: The pattern of the game hasn\u2019t really changed since the goal, as Spain control possession without creating anything close to a chance. Spain need to start moving the ball quicker if they are to open up this disciplined defence. 37 mins: Hermoso knocks a long ball down for Sampedro but once again the South Africa defence are first to the ball and clear it. Kari Tulinius emails in to say: \u201cThe pattern of this game, with Spain trying to weave their way through a resolute defense, while South Africa counter at speed, reminds me of the match between Spain and Holland at the 2014 World Cup. And we all remember how that game went.\u201d 35 mins: Putellas tries to find a gap in the defence but Van Wyk reads it well and cuts out the pass. Spain really need greater composure here. 33 mins: Losada lines up a free-kick on the left-hand side of the area. She sends in a low shot/cross which a defender reads and whacks clear. It gets worse for Losada who clashes with Kgatalana after the South Africa tries to block a cross but only succeeds in cleaning out the Spaniard. 31 mins: South Africa\u2019s defence is certainly well organised and is keeping Spain at bay, forcing them to look a lot longer than they are used to and frankly it is not suiting Spain, who seem to be panicking. 29 mins: A deep cross is lumped towards the penalty spot by Spain where Hermoso is waiting but her flicked headed loops calmly into Dlamini\u2019s arms. Losada gets one in the face from the ball and takes a few seconds on the ground but seems ok. 27 mins: Can Spain recover from this? They have been utterly dominant for the majority of the game without creating anything useful. What a goal! Kgatlana gets the ball 20 yards from goal, drops a shoulder, cuts inside and chips a helpless Panos, with the ball landing in the top corner. Great stuff. Is there a shock on here? 23 mins: South Africa are growing in confidence, as shown by Ramalepe doing a majestic turn in her own defensive third to bamboozle the opposition. Spain have had over 70 per cent so far, which is a sign of their dominance. Sampedro lifts a cross into the box, Hermoso chests it down and turns, looking to volley home but she is crowded out and the ball is cleared. 21 mins: A cross from the right is ripe for volleying but Sampedro fails to make a decent connection from 15 yards out and the ball slowly bounces into the goalkeeper\u2019s arms. 19 mins: Hermoso lifts a cross over everyone from the left, which South Africa eventually battle to clear. The Spain player gets the ball again in a similar position but her low cross finds a woman in yellow and once again the danger is removed. 17 mins: South Africa whip a corner in from the left, which goalkeeper Panos has to fist clear from the front post. Jane sends in a low cross but there is no one there to meet it, making things easier for Panos to collect on this occasion. 15 mins: South Africa are just about holding firm here and cause a little problem down the other end thanks to a long ball over the top to be chased. Spain fail to clear and Mthandi was bundled over to give South Africa a free-kick, 20 yards from goal. Vilakazi steps up and almost finds the top corner and would have it was not for Leon flicking it over. 12 mins: Putellas is brought down on the edge of the area to earn a free-kick. Attackers can no longer mingle with the defensive wall, so Spain have created their own in front of the South African obstacle. Leon whips it over the wall with her left foot but it\u2019s also too high for the bar. 10 mins: Losada sends in a free-kick from the left flank into the area where Spain have the height advantage but it\u2019s a poor set-piece, cleared at the edge of the area. 8 mins: Anyway ... we\u2019re all quite excited that Gary Bloom is on commentary here and all we want is a return of Serie A football on terrestrial TV. Spain are utterly dominant here and it is looking of a case of how many they will scored. 6 mins: Spain get a corner after Dlamini palms a shot behind. Sadly for Spain, it ends up on the edge with Losada who whacks it wildly wide. 4 mins: Spain look the more comfortable on the ball and are spending a bit of time in the final third. A cross comes in for Caldentey but she fails to make contact and it is cleared. 2 mins: There\u2019s plenty of shadow across the pitch. Spain get hold of the ball early on and they will be looking to keep hold of it for long periods. South Africa are keen to pass it out from the back rather than whacking it clear. It works as they create a counter but it eventually breaks down before the reach the Spanish area. Kick-off! Let\u2019s get ready to rumble! It\u2019s not full in Le Havre as the national anthems are belted out. Spain really need to work on some words for theirs, as it does get anyone in the mood for football. Just before kick-off here is some news coming out of Fifa ... This is South Africa\u2019s first World Cup, so it\u2019s a big moment for the country. The South African public is certainly behind them ... Spain certainly have some good pedigree ... Could Spain be the dark horses in France? Check out our writers\u2019 predictions ... A video guide to the tournament, just for you ... It\u2019s a lovely day in Le Havre, that\u2019s for sure. The sun is shining and there is not a cloud in the sky. The only risk would be it getting too warm for a high tempo match. South Arica get warm in Le Havre ... There are plenty of Barcelona players in the Spain squad - 10 to be precise - with only two playing abroad. One of those is Celia Jim\u00e9nez, a 23-year-old defender, who is also an aeronautical engineer. She has studied in America and is currently playing for Seattle reign. Women\u2019s football is big in Spain, with both Atletico Madrid and Athletic Bilbao hosting domestic sellouts at their respective stadiums this seasons and there is plenty of chance for it to grow. When I lived in Bilbao everyone supported Athletic and plenty of the girls in my class played for local teams. Here is Suzanne Wrack on women\u2019s football in Spain ... There\u2019s plenty to learn about the history of women\u2019s football. Spain: Sandra Pa\u00f1os, Torrej\u00f3n, Paredes, Mapi Le\u00f3n, Corredera, Losada, Torrecilla, Putellas, Amanda, Caldentey, Jenni Hermoso South Africa: Dlamini, Ramalepe, Vilakazi, Matlou, Van Wyk, Biyana, Jane, Motlhalo, Mthandi, Fulutudilu, Kgatlana. Conveniently, we also have a guide to the South African team ... The Spain team have already been for a wander on the pitch ... If you don\u2019t know your Amandas from your Jennis, here\u2019s our guide to the Spain team: The tournament starts in Le Havre for Spain and South Africa today. It\u2019s not the most glamorous of places, let\u2019s be honest, but it could be the perfect setting for these two to getting going at the World Cup. Spain are certainly the favourites coming into this and could go a long way in the tournament if things go their way. There is plenty of quality in the Spanish side, including Jenni Hermoso who was top scorer in the Spanish league last season and will be aiming to show what she can do on the international stage against South Africa\u2019s questionable defence. South Africa do possess Africa\u2019s player of the year, Thembi Kgatlana, who will be looking to lead their attacking side to a surprise victory. Both sides will be up for it but it;s certainly Spain\u2019s game to lose according to the bookies.",

      "body": "<p>Jason Roy is no longer out of sorts. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/03/england-pakistan-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">At Trent Bridge against Pakistan</a> he had a bit of a nightmare, dropping a straightforward catch and missing an early sweep. But in Cardiff he was back to his best, hitting 153 from 121 balls, his ninth ODI century, which dictated the outcome of the match that England won by 106 runs. And for good measure Roy held a fine diving catch to break Bangladesh\u2019s best partnership.</p> <p>Roy\u2019s innings was responsible for the first monumental score of the tournament, 386 for six. Bangladesh chased valiantly with Shakib Al Hasan, who is having a superb tournament, hitting a wonderfully resolute and resourceful century. But a record run chase in World Cup history was way beyond them; that landmark still resides with Ireland in Bengalaru against England in 2011.</p> <p>So England are relieved to be back on course after a copybook batting display and a competent one from the bowlers, with Jofra Archer outstanding especially in his first spell. Effortless pace dismissed Soumya Sarkar and disturbed the others. Next stop for Morgan\u2019s team is Southampton, where they meet West Indies on Friday. For Bangladesh there was no disgrace in this defeat. They battled hard throughout but were outgunned on a ground where it can be so hard to defend, particularly when the pitch is so conducive to strokeplay.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/08/england-jofra-archer-tears-into-bangladesh-opening-batsmen-cricket\">England\u2019s Archer takes Bangladesh\u2019s Sarkar to the cleaners | Ali Martin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the start Roy and Jonny Bairstow demonstrated the virtues of displaying a little more discretion at the start of the innings. Bangladesh adopted the ploy, successful in England\u2019s first two games, of opening with a spinner, Shakib. This time the opening pair tried nothing extravagant against the slow bowler but it would not matter that Shakib yielded only two runs in his first two overs.</p> <p>Roy was timing the ball sweetly from the start while Bairstow was more tentative and for a while he could not quite hide his edginess. But before long the runs were flowing. Mashrafe Mortaza decided to open the bowling himself alongside Shakib rather than tossing the ball to Mustafizur Rahman, which would have been a more positive option. On this track, which possessed some live grass, early wickets were essential. That grass created pace rather than movement, which would prove appetizing for the batsmen.</p> <p>Moreover, a strong breeze would prove an impediment in the field. Those who drew the short straw were obliged to run in from the River Taff End with the ominous realisation that a mishit could clear the straight boundary. In fact Mortaza, by taking the obvious course at the toss, had probably done Eoin Morgan and his side a great favour when he decided to bowl first.

      "bodyText": "Jason Roy is no longer out of sorts. At Trent Bridge against Pakistan he had a bit of a nightmare, dropping a straightforward catch and missing an early sweep. But in Cardiff he was back to his best, hitting 153 from 121 balls, his ninth ODI century, which dictated the outcome of the match that England won by 106 runs. And for good measure Roy held a fine diving catch to break Bangladesh\u2019s best partnership. Roy\u2019s innings was responsible for the first monumental score of the tournament, 386 for six. Bangladesh chased valiantly with Shakib Al Hasan, who is having a superb tournament, hitting a wonderfully resolute and resourceful century. But a record run chase in World Cup history was way beyond them; that landmark still resides with Ireland in Bengalaru against England in 2011. So England are relieved to be back on course after a copybook batting display and a competent one from the bowlers, with Jofra Archer outstanding especially in his first spell. Effortless pace dismissed Soumya Sarkar and disturbed the others. Next stop for Morgan\u2019s team is Southampton, where they meet West Indies on Friday. For Bangladesh there was no disgrace in this defeat. They battled hard throughout but were outgunned on a ground where it can be so hard to defend, particularly when the pitch is so conducive to strokeplay. At the start Roy and Jonny Bairstow demonstrated the virtues of displaying a little more discretion at the start of the innings. Bangladesh adopted the ploy, successful in England\u2019s first two games, of opening with a spinner, Shakib. This time the opening pair tried nothing extravagant against the slow bowler but it would not matter that Shakib yielded only two runs in his first two overs. Roy was timing the ball sweetly from the start while Bairstow was more tentative and for a while he could not quite hide his edginess. But before long the runs were flowing. Mashrafe Mortaza decided to open the bowling himself alongside Shakib rather than tossing the ball to Mustafizur Rahman, which would have been a more positive option. On this track, which possessed some live grass, early wickets were essential. That grass created pace rather than movement, which would prove appetizing for the batsmen. Moreover, a strong breeze would prove an impediment in the field. Those who drew the short straw were obliged to run in from the River Taff End with the ominous realisation that a mishit could clear the straight boundary. In fact Mortaza, by taking the obvious course at the toss, had probably done Eoin Morgan and his side a great favour when he decided to bowl first. No one has chased more than 328 in a World Cup match. The openers had posted 128 inside 20 overs when Bairstow was superbly held at extra cover by Mehidy Hasan at extra cover. Joe Root then supported Roy modestly in a 77-run union before being bowled off the inside edge. His departure may have enhanced the problems of Mortaza, the Bangladesh captain, since Jos Buttler was now promoted to No 4. Roy reached his hundred in 92 balls, his ninth in ODI cricket, and then accelerated. He had time to hit a double hundred but was probably seduced in the 35th over, which was bowled by Hasan, the off-spinner. The problem for Roy was that he hit the first three balls for six, all massive strikes into the wind and into the stands, which were now packed. Now he may have felt duty bound to carry on regardless. Hasan bowled a little wider and quicker and Roy swung. This time the ball spewed in the air and Mortaza at extra cover, like the good desperate captain that he is, made sure that he hung on to a ball that was swirling in the breeze. But Buttler was still there to torment Mortaza though soon he was limping, which was later revealed to be caused by a hip problem that kept him off the pitch later. Bairstow was an eager, highly competent replacement behind the stumps. With a stream of powerful orthodox drives Buttler struck 64 from 44 balls.

An authoritative annual report on drug use in Europe published on the same day as Gove\u2019s admission confirmed the UK as one of the world\u2019s leading markets for the class A substance. The Lisbon-based European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) examined survey data from all 28 EU countries. It found that Britain had the continent\u2019s highest usage rates among young people \u2013 4.7% of British 15 to 34-year-olds said they had used cocaine in the last 12 months. More than a quarter of the people seeking treatment for cocaine addiction in Europe, 20,290 out of 72,424, were doing so in the UK. The latest crime survey for England and Wales corroborates the fact that cocaine use is increasingly normalised, with 875,000 people admitting to it. Tony Saggers, the former head of drugs threat and intelligence at the National Crime Agency, described Gove\u2019s admission as a missed opportunity for a former justice secretary who would have intimately understood the myriad harms and misery associated with the distribution and consumption of cocaine. Saggers said: \u201cI\u2019d like to see him say that, on reflection, he was really stupid and the reasons I would never do it again and the insight that I now have is because of the wider harm that it funds; its links to organised crime, the exploitation of people. \u201cHe needed to say: \u2018I realise now how irresponsible cocaine use is.\u2019 But he doesn\u2019t seem to have done that.\u201d Steve Rolles, a senior policy analyst of the Transform Drug Policy Foundation, chided Gove for appearing to trivialise cocaine use despite presiding as justice secretary over a system that incarcerates thousands of people a year for class A offences. \u201cThere is a rich thread of hypocrisy where people are confessing to drug use but still condemning everyone else who makes the same mistake,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are still propping up a system where only unethical cocaine is available and anyone who chooses to use it can get a criminal record and wouldn\u2019t ever make it to being a minister.\u201d Others agreed with the former Tory minister Crispin Blunt, the co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group for drug policy reform, who said the consensus on the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d was collapsing and the time had come for all serious politicians to consider reforms. \u201cSadly, Michael \u2013 like others before him \u2013 has delivered a politically crafted and deeply unconvincing handwringing statement of regret for committing a victimless crime,\u201d he said. \u201cThe victims have largely been created by policy and the law.\u201d Mohammed Qasim, a research fellow at Leeds Beckett University who studies drug-use patterns, said Gove\u2019s admission threatened to downplay the harm that cocaine has on poorer, less privileged communities. \u201cHe\u2019s saying \u2018I\u2019ve done cocaine but look at me now, I\u2019ve done well.

But that was how much of the world\u2019s press reported it.

It is untrue, as many claim, that she was not force-fed only because of Holland\u2019s euthanasia laws.

And while her death was not a case of euthanasia, it is important to ask whether the legalisation of euthanasia made it easier for a deeply pained individual to imagine death as a way out.</p> <p>These are complicated issues to which there are no straightforward answers.

      "bodyText": "If a gorilla walked right in front of your eyes, you wouldn\u2019t miss it, would you? Actually, half the country probably would. In a classic 1999 experiment, psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons showed people a video of basketball players, some wearing white shirts, some wearing black, and asked them to count how many times the players in white passed the ball. Halfway through the film, a woman in a gorilla suit saunters into the scene, faces the audience, thumps her chest and walks away. Extraordinarily, more than half of Chabris\u2019s and Simons\u2019s subjects were so intent on watching the ball being thrown that they failed to see the gorilla. The experiment poses important questions about the reliance of eyewitness accounts. It also has a bearing on the way we access information, including news. Two stories last week illustrate how we often see what we expect, or want, to see. The first is the tragic story of Dutch teenager Noa Pothoven. Sexually assaulted and raped as a young girl, Pothoven\u2019s pain led to post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and anorexia. So consumed was she by her mental distress that in 2017 she contacted an \u201cend of life\u201d clinic to request euthanasia. It refused, because of her age. For a time, she was in hospital so she could be fed intravenously, having become dangerously underweight. Earlier this year, however, she decided that she wanted no further treatment and refused all food and fluids. Her parents and doctors agreed not to force-feed her. Last Sunday, she died at home, aged 17. It\u2019s a heartbreaking and unsettling story. What it wasn\u2019t was an account of a teenager being \u201clegally euthanised\u201d by the state. But that was how much of the world\u2019s press reported it. It became a shocking tale, not just of the tragedy of Pothoven\u2019s life but also of the immorality of the state in helping a vulnerable teenager to end it.

But the wider context of the distortions is important, too. There is a fraught debate in many countries about euthanasia and assisted suicide. The tragedy of Pothoven\u2019s life and death revealed, for many, the ugly reality of such policies. \u201cEuthanasia and assisted suicide are a defeat for all,\u201d tweeted the pope on Wednesday. Many journalists and readers may have refrained from asking deeper questions about the initial account because the misreporting allowed them to see what they wanted to see. Much of what we call fake news may be like this \u2013 the result not of a desire to lie, but to reduce complex problems to simple truths. Pothoven\u2019s case poses many questions about her suffering and treatment. It is untrue, as many claim, that she was not force-fed only because of Holland\u2019s euthanasia laws. In many countries, including Britain, euthanasia is illegal, but doctors and the courts often accept that competent adults have \u201cthe right to choose whether to eat or not\u201d even if \u201cthe refusal is tantamount to suicide\u201d.

      "body": "<p>\u00c9douard Louis became an international literary sensation aged 21, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/05/the-end-of-eddy-by-edouard-louis-review\" title=\"\"><em>The End of Eddy</em></a><em>,</em> his debut autobiographical novel about growing up poor, gay and bullied in northern France, was published in 2014. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/20/history-of-violence-edouard-louis-review-edmund-white\" title=\"\"><em>History of Violence</em></a> recounted how he was raped and almost murdered by a man he had just met and is out now in paperback. In his third book <em>Who Killed My Father</em>, published earlier this year, Louis uses personal experience again \u2013 in this case the story of his father whose back was damaged in a factory accident \u2013 to launch a scathing social and political critique of the violence he sees perpetrated against the working class. \u201cI want to be a writer of violence,\u201d he has said. \u201cThe more you talk about violence, the more you can undo violence.\u201d</p> <p><strong>There is no question mark in the title of your most recent book. Is that because you know who killed your father?</strong><br>It\u2019s not a question; it\u2019s a declaration.</p> <p><strong>When we spoke </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/19/interview-edouard-louis-the-end-of-eddy-front-national-marine-le-pen-kim-willsher\" title=\"\"><strong>two years ago</strong></a><strong>, you said this book would be a tragedy. Is that how you would describe it now</strong><strong>?</strong><br>I believe so, in that it describes how the bodies of working-class people are destroyed by the system. This book transmits my anger against that violence. <em>Who Killed My Father </em>is the truth about politics and politicians; a question, literally, of life and death. We know if you are a factory worker in France you have a 50% higher chance of dying before 55 compared with executives. Working-class women are more likely to suffer violence; blacks and Arabs are more likely to die. Politicians like Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron deny this reality. I have tried to restore the truth of this through my father\u2019s story.</p> <p><strong>So th</strong><strong>e book </strong><strong>is more political than personal?</strong><br>It is both political and intimate. When I was very young, perhaps eight, nine, they changed the benefits system in France and started asking people to return to work, whatever the state of their bodies. The administration contacted my father, whose back had been destroyed, and said: \u201cYou have to go back to work\u201d, so he did, as a road sweeper, which destroyed his body even more. Politicians like Jacques Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy, Macron\u2026 they took political decisions whose impact was as personal and intimate for my father as his first kiss or the first time he made love. </p> <p><strong>Some French editors have defined </strong><strong>the book as a love letter to your father. Is it?</strong><br>I don\u2019t think so. I have to admit I don\u2019t know if I love my father or not. But it\u2019s not the point \u2013 the violence is the point. When I write about politics and ask questions, I don\u2019t ask if I love the person I\u2019m writing about or if they love me. And I will fight for them, whether they love me or not.</p> <p><strong>In your first novel, <em>The End of Eddy,</em> you were </strong><strong>hard on your father; this is a much kinder portrait. What changed?</strong><br>In <em>The End of Eddy,</em> I showed the complexity of my father. He was a violent person and I have many, very clear, memories of his violence. After <em>History of Violence </em>came out, he called me and I went to see him. I hadn\u2019t seen or spoken to him for about five years. When he opened the door and I saw his body was destroyed by poverty and the suffering he had endured, it helped me see another angle: I was capable of seeing him as a whole. I\u2019m not denying what I wrote in <em>The End of Eddy,</em> but I\u2019d written about the violence he made others suffer, not the violence he himself suffered.</p> <p><strong>You describe a concert you organised at home as a child to entertain your parents and friends and how desperate you were to have your father\u2019s attention. Is this book trying to get that attention?</strong><br>When I was growing up, my father was ashamed of me and said I was bringing shame on my family, but he was also capable of defending me. After I Ieft home, I didn\u2019t speak to my father. We didn\u2019t argue, it was just our lives became too different. He was in the north of France voting for the National Front and I was in Paris, studying philosophy and living my gay life as a militant left-winger. Today, in my daily existence, I don\u2019t concern myself at all with what my parents think of me.</p> <p><strong>You have written that you supported the gilets jaunes movement because the photos you saw of their bodies, \u201cravaged by work, fatigue, hunger and the permanent humiliation of the dominated by the dominant\u201d, resembled those of your father, brother, aunt\u2026</strong><br>I was bowled over when the movement started and suddenly I saw these bodies we see very little in public spaces and that I try to make visible in my books. The gilets jaunes movement made reality smash right into politics. You hear politicians on the radio and television and you think, what in the world are they talking about? Here we saw the reality. These gilets jaunes finally made us feel something had changed, politics had changed. People realised they could revolt and the politicians were reminded of that too. What was wonderful for me was that the dominant class panicked, they had a real sense of fear. Fear is something the people I grew up with feel every single day. Of course, I\u2019d like something more revolutionary, but for the dominant class to be afraid\u2026 It was like: finally, they know how it feels.</p> <p><strong>What did you read when you were young?</strong><br>When I was very young, I didn\u2019t read at all. I detested books. I grew up in a social class where books were absent. Reading was something nobody did. It took years for me to get the habit of reading books. Like my father and those around him, I believed reading was boring and useless and there was even a mistrust for literature. It wasn\u2019t that we\u2019d rejected literature, but that it had rejected us. It was the same with politics. An exception was made for old authors like \u00c9mile Zola and Victor Hugo because we knew they were on our side and fought for us.</p> <p><strong>What was the first book you read?</strong><br>I finally discovered reading with the Harry Potter series. Those books really marked me. Here was this boy growing up in a place he didn\u2019t belong to and didn\u2019t connect with and suddenly discovering there was another place, another world, where he did. There were also books studied at school by Marcel Proust, Andr\u00e9 Gide, Christopher Isherwood, and I felt that the story they were telling was my story. After that it was my friend Didier Eribon\u2019s book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/03/returning-to-reims-by-didier-eribon-review\" title=\"\"><em>Returning to Reims</em></a><em>.</em> Suddenly, I realised it was possible to be working class and gay and still succeed.</p> <p><strong>What books should every young person read?</strong><br>That depends on the person.

She essentially takes enough prescription drugs to allow her to sleep through most of her days, lest she should have to face up to the realities of her 20s. You, as a junior doctor, can be the judge of how realistic that is. Finally, I would suggest Heartburn by Nora Ephron, one of the funniest books I\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of reading over and over again. It taught me that even if we do navigate the confusing and sometimes brutal journey that is 20s singledom, the years beyond will have a lot of tricks in store for us, but we\u2019ll be able to laugh our way through them.

Catalans, by this point ravaged by injuries and players succumbing to concussion, barely mustered a resistance in the final quarter and it was no surprise when Josh Charnley seized on an error to score Warrington\u2019s fifth try.",

      "bodyText": "Here is the report from the French Open women\u2019s singles final, Kevin Mitchell\u2019s view from Roland Garros to follow: The champion speaks! \u201cI played the perfect match today. I\u2019m so proud of myself and my team. \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy two weeks!\u201d Barty drops to her haunches after realising what she has just achieved. That was emphatic from the Australian, who never let Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 get a foothold. Second set: Barty 6-1, 6-3 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): A big net cord takes the Czech to 30-15 and a loose cross-court backhand from Barty hints at some nerves. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 though seems unable to capitalise and from 40-30 up she is only spared a match point on her own serve by another fortunate net cord. However, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 fails to put away a volley to win the game and on the next point a measured rally ends with the Czech dumping a forehand into the net. Barty seals the win with an overhead smash! Second set: *Barty 6-1, 5-3 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): After some fight in the last game we get more passivity from Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 on the Barty serve. Short rallies and power hitting Barty take her within a game of the title. Second set: Barty 6-1, 4-3 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 seems flat and so is the crowd. Everyone can tell where this is going... or can they? A fiery winner to go up 15-0 and some resistance from the baseline sees the Czech hang around for another game. Second set: *Barty 6-1, 4-2 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Too good from Barty, she beats Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 at her own game with a delicate backhand drop shot to go up 15-0. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 hangs in to get back to 30-30 but then on on consecutive points Barty pushes her opponent deep then hits winners into the open space to hold. Second set: Barty 6-1, 3-2 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): A rare straightforward service for Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1. She finishes off the game to love by drawing Barty into the net and putting away a backhand into a near-empty return court. Second set: *Barty 6-1, 3-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): No such luck on the Barty serve, a dominant hold. Second set: Barty 6-1, 2-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Barty is not giving up anything, forcing Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 to work for every point. The Australian gets some additional fortune when a close line call goes her way to bring about another break point but this time Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 shows some resistance, saving two break points to hold. Second set: *Barty 6-1, 2-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Even Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 gets a sniff she cannot capitalise. After forcing Barty on to the back foot the Czech misses an overhead to move to 30-30. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 shows some good fight to reach deuce, pulling Barty into the net to and then sending her scrambling back again. Barty looks steely-eyed though and holds firm to consolidate her break. Second set: Barty 6-1, 1-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Barty is not letting up here and this could be over quickly. The Australian again breaks with relative ease. Earlier on we saw Dominic Thiem set-up a rematch of the 2018 final with Rafael Nadal in the men\u2019s singles. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s report from Roland Garros: Looking ahead to the grass court season, Andy Murray, who is set to return in doubles action at Queen\u2019s later this month, has revealed that he is \u201cpretty relaxed\u201d about ever playing singles again: First set: *Barty 6-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Barty marches towards a set lead showing some real power on her groundstrokes and reaching 40-15 with a wonderful overhead. The Australian is made to wait but eventually seals the game and first set with a whipping forehand. First set: Barty 5-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1\u2019s momentum is immediately halted as Barty earns three break chances with a drop shot of her own. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 saves one with a firm forehand drive down the line, another by going cross-court and when Barty floats a slice into the net we are back at deuce. That rally is short-lived, two errors from Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 later and Barty will serve for the first set. First set: *Barty 4-1 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 creates an opening at 30-40 but Barty reads her opponent\u2019s latest drop shot attempt to pull back level. A hint of complacency from Barty gives the Czech two more shots at an immediate break-back and the second is taken. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 finally gets herself on the scoreboard. First set: Barty 4-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Thanks to Will for letting me get a little breather after that epic men\u2019s semi-final. I will be guiding you through the remainder of this one. Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 is having a hard time getting on the board but is refusing to move away from her game, including a trademark drop shot. Barty though is relentless and so far has chased down everything. The Australian outlasts her rival in this one, eventually taking a third break point to put the first set firmly within her grasp. First set: Barty* 3-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Barty looks the more settled here, that\u2019s for sure. She goes 30-0 up with a vicious forehand from the baseline, which Vondrousova has no chance of catching. The game is wrapped up with a cracking forehand into space. No messing about from the Australian. First set: Barty 2-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1* (* denotes server): Vondrousova completely miscues a backhand and it floats off court and then she whacks another into the net from the baseline leaving her plenty to do. Barty does similar with a forehand and then a double fault gifts the Australian two break points. The first is squandered by sending one very long but Vondrousova sets her own downfall in the end with an overhit forehand. First set: Barty* 1-0 Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 (* denotes server): Barty serves first and looks in good nick as she races into a 30-0 but a long forehand gives Vondrousova in opening. The teenager does not build on it, as she cuts a backhand straight into the net. An ace from Barty completes the hold. The pair are now getting into the swing of things on court after posing for photos and sending the mascots on their merry way. Here come the players, along with the mascots and a massive bunch of pink flowers each. I am not sure what they are supposed to do with the flowers during the game. The sun is certainly out but there\u2019s a little bit of cloud around, even if most of them look pretty friendly. Will I learn to spell Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 off the top of my head? No. It\u2019s a copy and paste job, I suspect. Thiem wins! So not too long to go now ... Barty found a gap in the weather to begin her warmup. Thiem loses ... put that second bottle of wine in the fridge. Thiem has broken back against Djokovic and is now serving for the match. All these disruptions have not really helped either player. It looks very sunny at Roland Garros now, which is a relief. Rather annoyingly for this game Djokovic has broken Thiem in the final set. Could be a bit of a wait, still. Thiem and Djokovic are readying themselves to return to the court, which is good news. The rain also means Barty and Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 have been unable to get much time on the outside courts to warm up, so it still could be quite a while until the women\u2019s final begins. At least the rain is a great reminder of what a broadcaster Matt Smith is. He\u2019s deserved better gigs than the ones he has had during his career. A lovely fella, too. The covers are coming off ... There is currently no play in the men\u2019s semi-final and the umbrellas are still up at Roland Garros. Might be a good time to make a coffee or open a bottle of wine. Matt Smith and Annabelle Croft are currently explaining the impact of weather. Croft is backing Barty to win the final, it would seem, saying playing a left-hander will not worry the Australian. There\u2019s still plenty of wind and rain about in Paris, delaying Djokovic v Thiem and might have an impact on this game later, too, but let\u2019s hope not. Barty quit tennis in 2014, playing professional cricket for a period before returning to the court two years later. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey the last three years,\u201d Barty said after her semi-final victory. \u201cIt\u2019s been an incredible journey the last two weeks. I feel like I have played some really good tennis, some consistent tennis. Although that level wasn\u2019t there today for the whole match necessarily, it was there when I needed it. \u201cI\u2019m just so proud of myself the way we were able to go out there and handle it today. All things considered, we\u2019re in a pretty amazing place now.\u201d And now it\u2019s raining at Roland Garros \u2026 Prior to this, Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1\u2019s finest performance at a Grand Slam saw her reach the fourth round of the US Open last year, so she is certainly in uncharted territory. A bit more on Ashleigh Barty heading into today\u2019s final ... It\u2019s not the French Open final anyone anticipated at the start of the tournament but here we are and it should be a pretty exciting one. Ashleigh Barty arrives as the favourite against Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1, who has saw off Johanna Konta in the semi-final, meaning she will certainly be ready for the occasion. As they are both surprise finalists there should be a little less pressure on them and could make for an entertaining clash at Roland Garros. Barty has come back to tennis after quitting the sport in 2014 and is certainly calmer on court. Teenager Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 has pulled off the odd shock on the way to the final but, needless to say, this will be her toughest test. She is yet to drop a set all tournament, which shows what kind of form she is in. Either way, it will be a great day for one of these. However, it will be slightly delayed due to Djokovic v Thiem overrunning. Luckily, you can follow it all here:",

As yet, they have been unsuccessful. (Boston\u2019s mayor, Marty Walsh, preferred to concentrate on the city\u2019s LGBTQ Pride celebrations.) Another setback came in the form of Brad Pitt, who insisted that SHFA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/straight-pride-brad-pitt-milo-yiannopoulos\" title=\"\">stop using his name</a> and likeness on its site, almost as if being associated with knuckle-dragging homophobia was embarrassing or disgusting or something.</p> <p>Enter \u201calt-right\u201d controversy-merchant Milo Yiannopoulos, who proclaimed himself delighted to be Straight Pride\u2019s new mascot.

      "bodyText": "At times like these, it\u2019s a relief that LGBTQ people have absolutely nothing to worry about. Apart from Brunei wanting to stone them to death; Ann Widdecombe saying that science could \u201cproduce an answer\u201d to being gay; the rise of homophobic hate crime, exemplified, last week, by a lesbian couple being viciously attacked on a London bus for refusing to kiss for the entertainment of leering heterosexual men. Just that sort of thing \u2013 relentlessly, globally, forever. Other than that, LGBTQ people have got it easy. So consider people so dense one imagines a microwaved cheeseburger where their brains should be \u2013 what about oppressed straight guys? Who will speak for them? Take the US men\u2019s rights group, Super Happy Fun America (SHFA), which applied for a permit to hold a \u201cStraight Pride\u201d parade in Boston to \u201ccelebrate the diverse history, culture and contributions of the straight community\u201d. As yet, they have been unsuccessful. (Boston\u2019s mayor, Marty Walsh, preferred to concentrate on the city\u2019s LGBTQ Pride celebrations.) Another setback came in the form of Brad Pitt, who insisted that SHFA stop using his name and likeness on its site, almost as if being associated with knuckle-dragging homophobia was embarrassing or disgusting or something. Enter \u201calt-right\u201d controversy-merchant Milo Yiannopoulos, who proclaimed himself delighted to be Straight Pride\u2019s new mascot. Confusingly, he is gay, but at least he\u2019s available \u2013 after his book was dropped by his publisher and Facebook permanently banned him. Last year, things got so bad it was reported that British-born Yiannopoulos had applied to join Ukip. With his contrarian track record, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that he has seemingly opted to \u201ccome out\u201d as a self-hating gay man who hangs out with homophobes and we should all put aside our prejudices and be happy for him. Obviously, those involved with SHFA are engaged in a massive wind-up, although they probably believe that they\u2019re making an astute game-changing point about identity politics and that straight men are oppressed in these politically correct times. I\u2019m sure there are corners of the dark net where such musings would be applauded by gruff, mysteriously single, MAGA baseball cap-wearing men, when they\u2019re not complaining about frigid modern women or researching sarin gas. In the real world, there\u2019s a good reason why Gay Pride needs to exist and Straight Pride doesn\u2019t. Straight people, especially white straight people, don\u2019t have to stand up for their rights. They\u2019re OK, to the point where they can afford to budge up a bit and give different types of people space to breathe. Straight men such as those behind Straight Pride are auto-celebrated, auto-protected and auto-privileged every second of every minute of every day of their whingeing, resentful, spiteful lives. Perhaps they should hold a parade about that. It\u2019s too soon to appreciate Harvey Weinstein\u2019s wordplay Has disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein got his mojo back? Madonna, who worked with Weinstein on her 1991 documentary, Truth or Dare, has said that when she heard of Weinstein\u2019s fall from grace, she thought \u201cfinally\u201d, adding: \u201cIt was good that somebody who\u2019d been abusing his power for so many years was called out and held accountable.\u201d Weinstein responded with a statement weaving in Madonna song titles: \u201cIt\u2019s surprising that she conformed to what\u2019s in Vogue\u2026 I will not Justify My terrific feelings for her \u2026 She was that Ray of Light whom I will always Cherish\u2026 if getting on this bandwagon helps her sell records, Turn Up the Radio.\u201d And more in that vein \u2013 from a man facing criminal charges (which he denies) and embroiled in a lawsuit and a reported $44m settlement. Yet it seems he still feels safe and entitled enough to engage in excruciating, immature snark. Has the meaning of the word \u201cinappropriate\u201d still not sunk in? Doesn\u2019t he realise that the days of people faux-guffawing at his \u201cjokes\u201d are over (\u201cHilarious, Harv, do Taylor Swift songs now!\u201d)? In this spirit of wordplay, here are two more words for Weinstein: \u201cgrow\u201d and \u201cup\u201d. A bold call from John Lewis, but will it succeed in hard times? Congratulations to Sharon White, the new executive chairman of John Lewis. The soon-to-be ex-chief executive for Ofcom was, prior to that, the first black person to serve as permanent secretary to the Treasury. White, also recently tipped to be the next governor of the Bank of England, will be paid a basic salary of \u00a3990,000, to oversee John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain. For all White\u2019s attributes, this is being viewed as a surprising appointment. As well as not being promoted from within, as John Lewis bosses tend to be, White\u2019s retail experience is comparatively limited, though this seems to have been part of the attraction. Outgoing chairman, Charlie Mayfield, said that White was not \u201cthe conventional retail choice\u201d, but \u201cthese are not conventional retail times\u201d. Which is an understatement.

The census case stems from the commerce secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019 plan to ask respondents to the 2020 survey if they are US citizens. The proposed question \u2013 \u201cIs this person a citizen of the United States?\u201d \u2013 provides five possible answers: whether respondents were born in the US, a US territory, abroad to US citizen parents, became naturalized US citizens or are not citizens. A number of states sought to block the question. Opponents say many immigrants will not complete census forms featuring it, due to fears that their immigration status may be used against them. Because census results are used to determine how seats in Congress are apportioned, opponents of the question say an artificially deflated count would deal a blow to states with many immigrants, such as California and New York, which overwhelmingly vote Democratic. Census numbers also decide how much federal money cities and states receive. States opposing the immigration question contend that it is unconstitutional. But the court\u2019s conservative majority appears poised to uphold the plan. The case on political districts deals with whether state legislatures can forge congressional delegations that starkly contrast with the distribution of voters, as well as alleged race-based gerrymandering. In 2016, North Carolina Republicans took 53% of the vote and landed 10 of 13 congressional seats. In 2018, Democrats won a slight majority but took just three congressional districts. Republicans who led the state legislature came up with apparently advantageous voting maps. In Maryland, meanwhile, Democrats established voting districts that would benefit their party. At issue is whether such practices violate voters\u2019 rights. \u201cHowever one comes out on the legal issues, partisan gerrymandering unsettles the fundamental premise that people elect their representatives, not vice-versa,\u201d Ginsburg said in New York. Her remarks came amid a dramatic ideological shift on the court. The retirement last summer of Kennedy set the stage for the ascent of Brett Kavanaugh, a stringent conservative, in a confirmation process hit by allegations of sexual misconduct.

Gorsuch filled a seat vacated by the death of Antonin Scalia during Barack Obama\u2019s second term in office. That seat was held open by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who refused to grant a confirmation hearing to Obama\u2019s nominee, Merrick Garland. To indignant protest from Democrats and progressives, McConnell recently said he would fill any vacancy created in Trump\u2019s last year of office. Ginsburg said Kennedy\u2019s retirement \u201cwas, I would say, the event of greatest consequence for the current term, and perhaps for many terms ahead\u201d. But she also complimented Kavanaugh\u2019s hiring practices, saying the controversial justice \u201cmade history by bringing onboard an all-female law clerk crew\u201d. \u201cThanks to his selections,\u201d Ginsburg said, \u201cthe court has this term, for the first time ever, more women than men serving as law clerks.\u201d Ginsburg was the second woman ever appointed to the court and has become a feminist and pop cultural icon. She also highlighted the gender gap in lawyers she sees before the bench. Just 21% of lawyers who presented oral arguments this term were female, she said, adding: \u201cWomen did not fare nearly as well as advocates.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 to clarify quotes attributed to Ruth Bader Ginsberg about the supreme court\u2019s unannounced decisions.",

He was the rock star of pensions and fund management, awarded a CBE for his services to the economy. But now, since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\" title=\"\">Neil Woodford stopped </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\" title=\"\">investors from withdrawing their own money from his flagship fund,</a> he is in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.</p> <p>His Woodford Equity Income Fund holds the pension savings and investments of tens of thousands of people. But it has been performing so badly that investors were withdrawing money at the rate of \u00a310m a day.</p> <p>Last week, after 23 consecutive months in which withdrawals from the fund had been greater than the new money coming in, Woodford found he couldn\u2019t realise cash quickly enough to meet the withdrawal requests \u2013 at least at a decent price. He closed the fund to withdrawals, leaving legions of investors angry and in limbo for 28 days.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-jlRsbbF0k\" title=\"\">YouTube video he posted on Wednesday to finally apologise to </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-jlRsbbF0k\" title=\"\">investors</a>, he looked anything but the archetypal City fund manager, with his close-cropped hair and trademark casual jumper rather than suit and tie. In the video, filmed at his fund\u2019s headquarters on an industrial estate near Oxford, Woodford said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry that we\u2019ve had to take this decision. We understand our investors\u2019 frustration. All I can say in response to that is that this decision was motivated by your interests.\u201d</p> <p>Woodford said he had been forced to \u201cgate\u201d the fund because so many big investors were trying to pull money out that he wasn\u2019t able to meet the demand. His funds hold unusually big stakes in smaller and early stage unlisted companies, which are hard to sell quickly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-07T10:45:35/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Woodford equity fund performance\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-07T10:45:35/embed.html\">Woodford equity fund performance</a> </figure>  <p>The final straw had been Kent county council pension fund\u2019s request to take out its \u00a3263m holding. The trustees of Kent\u2019s pension fund \u2013 who had been trying to stem the losses Woodford had racked up for its 110,000 members \u2013 decided to pull out when it emerged at the end of last month that the flagship fund had shrunk by \u00a3560m to \u00a33.77bn in just four weeks. At its peak the fund was worth more than \u00a310bn.</p> <p>Of the \u00a3560m lost, just under \u00a3190m was made up of withdrawals. The rest \u2013 more than \u00a3370m \u2013 represented yet further declines in the value of the investments held in the fund, which at the end of April was made up of stakes in 101 companies ranging from housebuilders such as Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey to logistics business Eddie Stobart and a large number of esoteric healthcare firms.</p> <p>Under EU rules aimed at ensuring that funds which hold unquoted \u2013 and therefore potentially hard-to-sell \u2013 shares can retain their stability, these shares are permitted to make up no more than 10% of the portfolio. Woodford got around those rules, quite legally, by putting some of them into his separate, quoted Patient Capital investment trust \u2013 and taking Patient Capital shares into the main fund. He also listed some of them of the Guernsey stock exchange.</p> <p>But the Kent fund had left it just too late: instead of getting its cash back, its request triggered Woodford\u2019s suspension of trading in the fund.</p> <p>The video apology, in which Woodford set and answered his own questions, followed months during which he had been dismissing the concerns of investors and financial experts about his fund\u2019s prolonged poor performance.</p> <p>In February, his Woodford Equity Income Fund was listed for the first time on a \u201cSpot the Dog\u201d list compiled by Bestinvest, which highlights underperforming \u201cdog\u201d funds. Bestinvest criticised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/04/neil-woodfords-most-disastrous-stock-choices-a-roundup\" title=\"\">some of his worst investments</a> and described the fund as \u201ca Great Dane-sized\u201d new entrant to its list.</p> <p>Just a few weeks later, Woodford told the <em>Financial Times</em> that the investors who were pulling out were making \u201cappallingly bad decisions\u201d, influenced by \u201ca mountain of fake information and fake analysis\u201d that \u201cpisses me off\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"444f1b07af270605b51a2845bd9c3c7ee8ac915c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/444f1b07af270605b51a2845bd9c3c7ee8ac915c/75_0_1590_954/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Woodford apologises to investors in a still from his YouTube video last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Woodford apologises to investors in a still from his YouTube video last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Woodford Investment Management/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In December 2017 <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6ef0f16-d51f-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44\" title=\"\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c6ef0f16-d51f-11e7-a303-9060cb1e5f44\" title=\"\">said in an interview</a> that they key to successful investing was to \u201chave a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction\u201d.</p> <p>That arrogance is now provoking widespread anger, not just from his investors but also among other fund managers, who say Woodford has tarred the whole industry with the same loss-making brush. </p> <p>Last Wednesday the Financial Conduct Authority, the City\u2019s watchdog, said it was considering a formal investigation into the fund, and the following day, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/06/investment-funds-closer-bank-of-england-scrutiny-mark-carney\" title=\"\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney told an audience in Tokyo</a> that funds such as Woodford\u2019s (although he did not name him) needed closer scrutiny to lessen the risk of fire sales triggering market disruption. The Bank, he said, would start stress-testing funds to ensure they couldn\u2019t threaten a system-wide crisis.</p> <p>This is a staggering fall from grace for Woodford, who had been one of the UK\u2019s very best and most reliable stock pickers. Anyone who invested \u00a310,000 at the start of his quarter-of-a-century career at Invesco Perpetual would have seen their money grow to almost \u00a3250,000 by the time he left.</p> <p>Mark Dampier, director of research at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, declared in 2015 that Woodford was \u201carguably the best fund manager of his generation\u201d. Just weeks ago, despite the growing cloud surrounding Woodford, Hargreaves told its clients \u201cwe retain our conviction in him to deliver excellent long-term performance\u201d and reminded them that he had \u201cbuilt his career by investing against the herd\u201d and \u201cshown an ability to get the big calls right\u201d.</p> <p>Hargreaves\u2019s customers had \u00a32bn invested with Woodford at the end of March \u2013 roughly a fifth of all the money in his three big funds.</p> <p>Only when the fund was gated did Hargreaves, which has heavily promoted Woodford at discounted fees, finally drop Woodford Equity Income from its influential \u201cWealth 50\u201d list of favourite funds, which it marketed to its more than a million clients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0f005daa5130c712a4b635a8e2ef7f94d349970\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0f005daa5130c712a4b635a8e2ef7f94d349970/0_207_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bank of England governor Mark Carney has suggested that funds such as Woodford\u2019s need more scrutiny.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bank of England governor Mark Carney has suggested that funds such as Woodford\u2019s need more scrutiny.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hannah McKay/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Asked if he regretted his support for Woodford and the controversial discount fee structure, Dampier said: \u201cOur aim is to enable our clients to choose the best-in-class funds at lower fees. Our favourite fund choices have, for the most part, beaten their sector averages and benchmarks. Not every fund has, and we share our clients\u2019 disappointment and frustration when they don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Other big backers have also deserted Woodford. St James\u2019s Place last week took its clients\u2019 \u00a33.5bn to another manager. On Thursday another supporter, Openworks, did the same with its \u00a3330m.</p> <p>Woodford fell into fund management by accident. He had never even heard of the business until he rocked up in London in the 1980s, sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p> <p>In 1988 he joined Invesco Perpetual and built a reputation as a brilliant contrarian investor. When others piled into dotcom shares at the turn of the century, he decided against, and backed more traditional companies. He made huge gains when the dotcom crash came. He eschewed banking stocks before the financial crisis \u2013 and avoided that crash too.</p> <p>He held big stakes in giant companies, whose chief executives needed to retain his support. In 2012 his criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan was widely regarded to have cost Brennan his job, and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2012/oct/08/bae-opponent-fund-manager-neil-woodford\" title=\"\">criticism of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus</a> was seen as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p> <p>In 2014, feeling that he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, where he personally managed some \u00a325bn of funds, he set up his own firm, Woodford Investment Management. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and this quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first year, his flagship fund made a 16% return and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was called the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\" title=\"\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d21397f75ffac74ac6bd22085ac479c4240089a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d21397f75ffac74ac6bd22085ac479c4240089a7/0_79_4854_2912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Woodford is a keen student of the US investor Warren Buffett.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woodford is a keen student of the US investor Warren Buffett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Harnik/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But since then things have turned sour. Over the past four years, investors in Woodford Equity Income have collected a return of less than 1% \u2013 compared with 29% for the market as a whole. Over that same four-year period, Woodford has paid himself some \u00a363m.</p> <p>In the 2017-18 financial year alone, which was a dreadful period for his funds, Woodford Investment Management paid a \u00a336.5m dividend to a company called Woodford Capital. Woodford holds 65% of that firm, and his business partner Craig Newman has the remaining 35%.</p> <p>Woodford, who has spoken out against the huge bonuses awarded to other fund managers, and to the bosses of companies he has invested in, declined to answer any questions about his own pay, or to elaborate, beyond his YouTube video, on the fund\u2019s tricky situation.</p> <p>The firm\u2019s public relations officer asked the <em>Observer</em> to point out that Woodford had donated some of his pay to charity. But he was unable to state how much money had been donated, or to which causes. The PR person declined to comment when asked whether Woodford would consider pumping any of his personal millions back into the fund.</p> <p>Those who know Woodford say he is \u201cdecidedly unflashy\u201d and that it is \u201cdifficult to fathom where all that money goes\u201d.

      "bodyText": "He was, the BBC declared in 2015, \u201cthe man who can\u2019t stop making money\u201d. He was the rock star of pensions and fund management, awarded a CBE for his services to the economy. But now, since Neil Woodford stopped investors from withdrawing their own money from his flagship fund, he is in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. His Woodford Equity Income Fund holds the pension savings and investments of tens of thousands of people. But it has been performing so badly that investors were withdrawing money at the rate of \u00a310m a day. Last week, after 23 consecutive months in which withdrawals from the fund had been greater than the new money coming in, Woodford found he couldn\u2019t realise cash quickly enough to meet the withdrawal requests \u2013 at least at a decent price. He closed the fund to withdrawals, leaving legions of investors angry and in limbo for 28 days. In a YouTube video he posted on Wednesday to finally apologise to investors, he looked anything but the archetypal City fund manager, with his close-cropped hair and trademark casual jumper rather than suit and tie. In the video, filmed at his fund\u2019s headquarters on an industrial estate near Oxford, Woodford said: \u201cI\u2019m extremely sorry that we\u2019ve had to take this decision. We understand our investors\u2019 frustration. All I can say in response to that is that this decision was motivated by your interests.\u201d Woodford said he had been forced to \u201cgate\u201d the fund because so many big investors were trying to pull money out that he wasn\u2019t able to meet the demand. His funds hold unusually big stakes in smaller and early stage unlisted companies, which are hard to sell quickly. The final straw had been Kent county council pension fund\u2019s request to take out its \u00a3263m holding. The trustees of Kent\u2019s pension fund \u2013 who had been trying to stem the losses Woodford had racked up for its 110,000 members \u2013 decided to pull out when it emerged at the end of last month that the flagship fund had shrunk by \u00a3560m to \u00a33.77bn in just four weeks. At its peak the fund was worth more than \u00a310bn. Of the \u00a3560m lost, just under \u00a3190m was made up of withdrawals. The rest \u2013 more than \u00a3370m \u2013 represented yet further declines in the value of the investments held in the fund, which at the end of April was made up of stakes in 101 companies ranging from housebuilders such as Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey to logistics business Eddie Stobart and a large number of esoteric healthcare firms. Under EU rules aimed at ensuring that funds which hold unquoted \u2013 and therefore potentially hard-to-sell \u2013 shares can retain their stability, these shares are permitted to make up no more than 10% of the portfolio. Woodford got around those rules, quite legally, by putting some of them into his separate, quoted Patient Capital investment trust \u2013 and taking Patient Capital shares into the main fund. He also listed some of them of the Guernsey stock exchange. But the Kent fund had left it just too late: instead of getting its cash back, its request triggered Woodford\u2019s suspension of trading in the fund. The video apology, in which Woodford set and answered his own questions, followed months during which he had been dismissing the concerns of investors and financial experts about his fund\u2019s prolonged poor performance. In February, his Woodford Equity Income Fund was listed for the first time on a \u201cSpot the Dog\u201d list compiled by Bestinvest, which highlights underperforming \u201cdog\u201d funds. Bestinvest criticised some of his worst investments and described the fund as \u201ca Great Dane-sized\u201d new entrant to its list. Just a few weeks later, Woodford told the Financial Times that the investors who were pulling out were making \u201cappallingly bad decisions\u201d, influenced by \u201ca mountain of fake information and fake analysis\u201d that \u201cpisses me off\u201d. In December 2017 he said in an interview that they key to successful investing was to \u201chave a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction\u201d. That arrogance is now provoking widespread anger, not just from his investors but also among other fund managers, who say Woodford has tarred the whole industry with the same loss-making brush. Last Wednesday the Financial Conduct Authority, the City\u2019s watchdog, said it was considering a formal investigation into the fund, and the following day, Bank of England governor Mark Carney told an audience in Tokyo that funds such as Woodford\u2019s (although he did not name him) needed closer scrutiny to lessen the risk of fire sales triggering market disruption. The Bank, he said, would start stress-testing funds to ensure they couldn\u2019t threaten a system-wide crisis. This is a staggering fall from grace for Woodford, who had been one of the UK\u2019s very best and most reliable stock pickers. Anyone who invested \u00a310,000 at the start of his quarter-of-a-century career at Invesco Perpetual would have seen their money grow to almost \u00a3250,000 by the time he left. Mark Dampier, director of research at stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, declared in 2015 that Woodford was \u201carguably the best fund manager of his generation\u201d. Just weeks ago, despite the growing cloud surrounding Woodford, Hargreaves told its clients \u201cwe retain our conviction in him to deliver excellent long-term performance\u201d and reminded them that he had \u201cbuilt his career by investing against the herd\u201d and \u201cshown an ability to get the big calls right\u201d. Hargreaves\u2019s customers had \u00a32bn invested with Woodford at the end of March \u2013 roughly a fifth of all the money in his three big funds. Only when the fund was gated did Hargreaves, which has heavily promoted Woodford at discounted fees, finally drop Woodford Equity Income from its influential \u201cWealth 50\u201d list of favourite funds, which it marketed to its more than a million clients. Asked if he regretted his support for Woodford and the controversial discount fee structure, Dampier said: \u201cOur aim is to enable our clients to choose the best-in-class funds at lower fees. Our favourite fund choices have, for the most part, beaten their sector averages and benchmarks. Not every fund has, and we share our clients\u2019 disappointment and frustration when they don\u2019t.\u201d Other big backers have also deserted Woodford. St James\u2019s Place last week took its clients\u2019 \u00a33.5bn to another manager. On Thursday another supporter, Openworks, did the same with its \u00a3330m. Woodford fell into fund management by accident. He had never even heard of the business until he rocked up in London in the 1980s, sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read agricultural economics at the University of Exeter. In 1988 he joined Invesco Perpetual and built a reputation as a brilliant contrarian investor. When others piled into dotcom shares at the turn of the century, he decided against, and backed more traditional companies. He made huge gains when the dotcom crash came. He eschewed banking stocks before the financial crisis \u2013 and avoided that crash too. He held big stakes in giant companies, whose chief executives needed to retain his support. In 2012 his criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan was widely regarded to have cost Brennan his job, and his criticism of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus was seen as one of the reasons the deal collapsed. In 2014, feeling that he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, where he personally managed some \u00a325bn of funds, he set up his own firm, Woodford Investment Management. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and this quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first year, his flagship fund made a 16% return and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was called the \u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d. But since then things have turned sour. Over the past four years, investors in Woodford Equity Income have collected a return of less than 1% \u2013 compared with 29% for the market as a whole. Over that same four-year period, Woodford has paid himself some \u00a363m. In the 2017-18 financial year alone, which was a dreadful period for his funds, Woodford Investment Management paid a \u00a336.5m dividend to a company called Woodford Capital. Woodford holds 65% of that firm, and his business partner Craig Newman has the remaining 35%. Woodford, who has spoken out against the huge bonuses awarded to other fund managers, and to the bosses of companies he has invested in, declined to answer any questions about his own pay, or to elaborate, beyond his YouTube video, on the fund\u2019s tricky situation. The firm\u2019s public relations officer asked the Observer to point out that Woodford had donated some of his pay to charity. But he was unable to state how much money had been donated, or to which causes. The PR person declined to comment when asked whether Woodford would consider pumping any of his personal millions back into the fund. Those who know Woodford say he is \u201cdecidedly unflashy\u201d and that it is \u201cdifficult to fathom where all that money goes\u201d. Well, a lot of it appears to go on horses. He and his wife Madelaine have a few dozen top showjumpers training at a vast equestrian complex near their home in the Cotswolds. The house, near Tetbury, was built on land the Woodfords bought for nearly \u00a314m in 2013. They moved to the Cotswolds after a planning application to construct a dressage arena and 28-horse stabling block near their previous estate, in Buckinghamshire, was rejected following a row with neighbours. One of those neighbours, the BBC\u2019s Jeremy Paxman, described Woodford\u2019s planned addition as \u201cenormous, unsightly and environmentally unfriendly\u201d. The Tetbury venue, however, got the planners\u2019 green light and includes a full-size man\u00e8ge (dressage arena). Woodford, who came to the sport only after meeting Madelaine \u2013 a keen rider whom he married in 2015 \u2013 has put in the hours at the man\u00e8ge and now often takes part in eventing competitions on a bay gelding called Willows Spunky. Woodford\u2019s other passions are fast cars and racing bicycles. He starts up the Porsche at 5am every weekday to drive to his fund\u2019s minimalist offices on an industrial estate in Cowley, Oxford. At weekends he drives it down to the couple\u2019s \u00a36.3m glass-walled holiday home in Salcombe, Devon. Woodford\u2019s huge pay and luxury lifestyle haven\u2019t gone unnoticed by his investors, many of whom are relying on him to be a safe pair of hands and to increase the value of their retirement or rainy day fund. A comment on his YouTube video, by someone with the username Plato reads: \u201cArrogance, Incompetence, Complacency and greed: your name is Woodford! You have failed, Neil. Return the funds to your investors (including that \u00a337m bonus you pocketed this year despite a disastrous performance in all three funds).\u201d Luke Hilyard of the High Pay Centre said: \u201cThis particular instance of an investor making tens of millions while losing money for ordinary savers raises questions about the governance of the funds and platforms channelling other people\u2019s money into Woodford\u2019s fund, and the regulatory oversight of the process. \u201cThe case is also a microcosm of our wider business culture and economic system, where superstar managers in investment, banking, retail, commodities and other industries have been treated like gods and rewarded accordingly, yet ultimately have shown themselves to be highly fallible mortals whose success was always partly contingent on timing and luck.\u201d Woodford, who made his name at Invesco by backing big companies, but then switched to a new strategy of investing in smaller and unquoted companies in his own funds, has now pledged to change direction. In his video he said he would now be targeting bigger companies, especially FTSE 100 stocks \u2013 even though only a few weeks ago he was insisting that his approach was the correct one and that the best investment opportunities were \u201cabsolutely not\u201d in large companies.

Cash, who reached the fourth round here in 1988 and now works for Eurosport, added: \u201cWhere she has come in the last year is just incredible. She was a decent player and a very good doubles player \u2013 and the next thing you know, she\u2019s a grand slam champion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Collecting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (a free spirit from the Jazz Age who would have cheered her immediate reaction to winning), Barty emulated Court but ignored that courtside observation, preferring to namecheck her fellow Australian and contemporary Sam Stosur, who reached the final in 2010.</p> \n<p>Court, 76, is very much from another era, with different values. The West Australian, whose 24 majors are unmatched in tennis history, said in an interview two years ago the sport was \u201cfull of lesbians\u201d, provoking anger inside and outside the game. Barty was moved to support her doubles partner, Casey Dellacqua, who has two children with her partner, Amanda Judd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"48f5b546-841a-4591-8cd8-887c0c1a8390\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dW1yL0lfDDI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But beaming non-stop in one interview after another, Barty on Saturday nominated one former champion above all others as her inspiration: Evonne Goolagong Cawley. Victory made Barty the first Australian woman since Cawley in 1976 to reach No 2 in the world. It is doubly satisfying for her because they share an indigenous heritage, proud representatives of their race and their country.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Barty said. \u201cEvonne sent me a text a couple days ago and said this was her first grand slam [among seven]. I spotted her name on the trophy. I\u2019ll give her a call a little bit later on.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing she\u2019s created this path for indigenous tennis in Australia. Now it\u2019s becoming more nationwide. There are more opportunities for kids to start playing tennis, both male and female. Hopefully we can continue to create those opportunities and let kids know that this is an option for a career and they can enjoy it. And even if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a sport they can play for life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Barty is also a straight-talking hero to other players, present and former \u2013 including Gabriela Sabatini, who earlier in the week nominated her as her favourite player.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s extremely kind of her.

      "bodyText": "Ashleigh Barty celebrated her breakthrough French Open victory with an expletive used often enough by most people not named Margaret Court, the last Australian to win the title, 46 years ago, and a Christian fundamentalist whom the new champion respects but disagrees strongly with for her strident views on gay marriage. When Barty finished the final here on Saturday with a smash that sent the ball bouncing high into the seats on Court Philippe Chatrier to beat the Czech teenager Marketa Vondrousova, 6-1, 6-3, in an hour and 10 minutes, she looked dumbstruck and mouthed: \u201cWhat the fuck just happened?\u201d It was a typically down-to-earth reaction from a widely respected player her compatriot Pat Cash describes as \u201cextremely popular\u201d in the locker room. Cash, who reached the fourth round here in 1988 and now works for Eurosport, added: \u201cWhere she has come in the last year is just incredible. She was a decent player and a very good doubles player \u2013 and the next thing you know, she\u2019s a grand slam champion.\u201d Collecting the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen (a free spirit from the Jazz Age who would have cheered her immediate reaction to winning), Barty emulated Court but ignored that courtside observation, preferring to namecheck her fellow Australian and contemporary Sam Stosur, who reached the final in 2010. Court, 76, is very much from another era, with different values. The West Australian, whose 24 majors are unmatched in tennis history, said in an interview two years ago the sport was \u201cfull of lesbians\u201d, provoking anger inside and outside the game. Barty was moved to support her doubles partner, Casey Dellacqua, who has two children with her partner, Amanda Judd. But beaming non-stop in one interview after another, Barty on Saturday nominated one former champion above all others as her inspiration: Evonne Goolagong Cawley. Victory made Barty the first Australian woman since Cawley in 1976 to reach No 2 in the world. It is doubly satisfying for her because they share an indigenous heritage, proud representatives of their race and their country. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Barty said. \u201cEvonne sent me a text a couple days ago and said this was her first grand slam [among seven]. I spotted her name on the trophy. I\u2019ll give her a call a little bit later on. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing she\u2019s created this path for indigenous tennis in Australia. Now it\u2019s becoming more nationwide. There are more opportunities for kids to start playing tennis, both male and female. Hopefully we can continue to create those opportunities and let kids know that this is an option for a career and they can enjoy it. And even if it\u2019s not, it\u2019s a sport they can play for life.\u201d Barty is also a straight-talking hero to other players, present and former \u2013 including Gabriela Sabatini, who earlier in the week nominated her as her favourite player. \u201cThat\u2019s extremely kind of her. When I started playing tennis, I tried to build a unique style. I tried to build my own style. There were players that were dominant who I looked up to. In particular that was Evonne. When I got a little bit older, I began to realise what she achieved and just how remarkable that was. But there are so many amazing players, gracious players, who have this style and this flair that I always tried to emulate when I was a kid. \u201cMy coach always used to bring me back and say: \u2018We\u2019re creating our style.\u2019 That\u2019s probably one of the most magical things that\u2019s happened to me.\u201d Barty quit tennis in 2014 when the pressure of expectation became too much for her.

Croatia 1-0 Wales (Lawrence og 17)</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Bale nearly wins a long ball on the edge of the Croatian box, but can\u2019t bring it down under pressure from Vida. Wilson tries to pick up the scraps, but is bowled over. A very light tug from Kovacic. He wants the foul, but he isn\u2019t getting it. And the non-decision really costs Wales, because the hosts stream up the other end. A long ball down the left sends Perisic away in acres. He reaches the box and contemplates a shot, but fires a low cross into the six-yard box instead. Lawrence, rushing back, takes his eye off the ball as it clanks onto his shins and into the net. To be fair, Kramaric was lurking, he had to do something.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T13:31:20.385Z\">at 2.31pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cfbb5968f08ff012e270a45\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T13:19:24.808Z\">2.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>15 min:</strong> Croatia continue to hog the ball.

All a bit post-Lord-Mayor\u2019s-show.</p> <p><strong>That 2-1 win over the Azerbaijanis was swiftly followed by defeat in Hungary against a team, it\u2019s safe to say, still in transition in the wake of their 1954 World Cup heartache. </strong>Zlatko Dalic\u2019s men need to get back on the horse quicksmart if the 2018 World Cup runners-up aren\u2019t to miss the Euro 2020 party.</p> <p><strong>There are quite a lot of good omens for Croatia, though. </strong>For starters, they\u2019ve never, ever, ever lost a European Championship qualifier at home!

They\u2019ve never been beaten by the Welsh, winning three of four matches and drawing the other. They\u2019ve never lost in Osijek, winning nine of 11. And it\u2019s expected to be hot. </p> <p><strong>So this is a big ask for Wales, and a huge chance for Croatia to regain some momentum towards the Euros. </strong>\u201cWe recognise we\u2019re up against it,\u201d says Ryan Giggs. \u201cBut we\u2019re ready.\u201d Can they stun Croatia by making it two wins from two in Group E, following a narrow home win over Slovakia secured by Manchester United new boy Daniel James? <strong>Kick-off is at 2pm.</strong> It\u2019s on!</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T11:53:46.222Z\">at 12.53pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "No word from Ryan Giggs. Sure he\u2019ll be talking later. So that\u2019s your lot for this MBM. More live action coming up immediately at the Women\u2019s World Cup. Thanks for reading! So the three points put Croatia top of Group E on six points. Wales are third on three. Hungary can leapfrog them both if they win big in Azerbaijan later this afternoon. And that\u2019s that. Croatia deserve the win over the 90 minutes, but my goodness Wales asked some questions during the closing stages. No points today, but their character and determination against a very good team will give Ryan Giggs hope going forward. 90 min +5: Skoric has a dig from the edge of the Wales area, but it\u2019s blocked. 90 min +4: That Brozovic booking, followed by the substitution, has eaten up plenty of time ... and more importantly nixed that end-to-end momentum that was giving Wales a sniff. 90 min +3: Perisic is replaced by Skoric. 90 min +2: Brozovic is booked for a loose one on Allen. 90 min +1: This is wild end-to-end fun! First Kramaric cuts in from the left and sees his shot blocked by Hennessey. Then Bale, up the other end, crosses low from the right, only for Brooks to tickle a shot from the penalty spot towards the bottom left, Livakovic gathering. 90 min: There will be five added minutes. Roberts goes over in the Croatia area, but he\u2019s not getting a penalty. 89 min: What an exciting end to this marvellous match. Brooks crosses long from the left. Livakovic, under no pressure but strangely hesitant, very nearly allows it to fly out his box on the right. Wilson was arriving on the scene. But the keeper grabs it on the line. 88 min: Bale crosses deep from the left. Wilson\u2019s racing in at the far post. He heads high and wide, rashly so as he might have had time to take that down and size up the situation from there. It was a hellishly difficult chance to convert first time, put it that way. 87 min: Kramaric is once again sent free, Modric wedging a stunning pass down the inside-right channel. It\u2019s begging to be hit as it drops over the striker\u2019s shoulder, a la Jamie Vardy, but Kramaric allows it to bounce, then slices one wildly wide. 85 min: Kramaric scampers into space down the right. He\u2019s got men in the middle, but can only dribble a low cross to Lawrence, who clears after a fashion. Both sets of players seem painfully aware that this is in the balance, and the next few minutes will make such a difference to Group E. 83 min: Modric slides Perisic into space down the left, but the winger shoots wildly behind. Croatia are fading badly in this second half, just as they had in the first. 82 min: Croatia are sitting back and inviting pressure. The Welsh fans are in fine voice right now, singing their hymns and arias. 81 min: Wales are pushing Croatia back. The hosts are beginning to look nervous, and a loop into the mixer leads to a corner on the left. Mepham meets the set piece, but his header is weak and gently wafts into the arms of Livakovic. 80 min: That\u2019s the last act for James, who is exchanged for Matondo. 79 min: Jedvaj goes down after a garden-variety challenge by James, taking the opportunity to draw a little of the sting from the situation. Classic game management. A huge slice of luck for Wales! Brooks, to the right of the Croatia D, switches his feet and shoots for the top left. The ball clips off Vida\u2019s head and flies into the top right, with Livakovic going the wrong way! Wales, who had edged their way back into the game during the previous few minutes, are still in this! 76 min: Badelj comes on for Kovacic. 74 min: Bale creams a shot towards the bottom left from 25 yards. Livakovic does well to turn the dipping, swerving ball around the post. From the corner, Allen causes some mild panic amid a bustling box, but Croatia eventually clear their lines. 73 min: Allen plays a cute reverse pass down the inside-left channel and nearly releases James. The new United winger is eased out of it by the old Liverpool defender Lovren ... but only just. James hasn\u2019t seen much of the ball today, but has looked threatening on the few occasions he has. 72 min: Head tennis in the centre circle. Put your foot on it, someone, will you. 70 min: A cooling break. Delicious water, tasty water. 68 min: James sprints after a lost cause down the left. It\u2019s going to be a throw to Croatia. But he draws a foul from Vida, who slides in recklessly, and pointlessly seeing the ball\u2019s out of play. That\u2019s a yellow card, and more succour for Manchester United supporters, who will enjoy watching this pacy, skilful winger next season. 66 min: And then a second Welsh substitution as Ampadu replaces Vaulks. Croatia respond by swapping Brekalo for Pasalic. 65 min: Brooks prepares to come on for Smith. Before that can happen, an agitated Allen throws hands at Barisic. Wilson getting involved too. But it all quickly calms down. 63 min: All a bit scrappy now. The players on both sides perhaps dreaming of the upcoming cooling break. 61 min: Thing is, Wales have had their chances this afternoon. It\u2019s not a stretch to say they could easily have scored three. They\u2019ve been second best for the majority of the match so far, but even so they\u2019ve caused problems for a very fine team. 59 min: Allen scoops a fine pass down the inside-right channel for Bale. He\u2019s two on one, with Wilson to his left, totally free. Bale opts to take on the shot himself, cutting inside and softly curling into the arms of Livakovic. That\u2019s a poor effort, and not a much better decision, as Wilson was in acres. Though to be fair, it was a decent opportunity on its own terms, and he is Gareth Bale, so. 57 min: Croatia re-establish control with some sterile domination in the middle of the park. 55 min: Bale can\u2019t keep the resulting free kick down. Over the bar it flies, as he looks for the top left. 54 min: Lovren is livid. He rises above Bale to win a header on the edge of his own box. His arms are out as he jumps, and one of them brushes the top of Bale\u2019s head. It looks a fairly won header, but the referee considers it a foul, and furthermore books the defender. That\u2019s a bit harsh, but then Jedvaj got away with one big-style a couple of minutes ago, so it\u2019s swings and roundabouts. 52 min: So much for Welsh momentum at the end of the first half. It\u2019s all Croatia again. An awful lot of passing, this way and that. Then suddenly Kovacic slips a ball down the inside-right channel to release Kramaric into the area. He\u2019s free, but the flag goes up. That was an extremely tight decision, Kramaric looked level. But once again Wales get the benefit of the doubt. 50 min: Jedvaj is booked for an extremely unpleasant tackle on Allen. Studs on shin, and he really should be walking for that. Allen is lucky that he\u2019s not seriously injured. But they don\u2019t get the luck here. A little bit of pinball in the Welsh box, and Modric forces the ball to Perisic on his left. Perisic takes a touch inside, then slams a shot into the bottom left. That really had been coming, because after the disallowed Kovacic effort, Brozovic lifted a 20-yard shot over the bar. Wales up against it now. 47 min: Brekalo tears down the right and cuts into the Wales box. Brekalo slams a shot towards the bottom right. Hennessey sticks out a leg to stop it, a fine save, but the ball breaks back to Kovacic on the edge of the area. Kovacic fires a shot into the bottom right, but it\u2019s ruled out for offside, Kramaric standing alone behind the Welsh back line. But he wasn\u2019t in Hennessey\u2019s eyeline, so Wales have arguably got away with one there. We go again! No half-time substitutions, and Wales get the second half underway. Half-time entertainment. Another Saturday, another superb Barney Ronay column. \u00a1No pasar\u00e1n! That\u2019s that for the first 45. Croatia have been the superior side, Wales at times unable to get a sniff. And yet there\u2019s only one goal in it. In addition, Wales have stung Livakovic\u2019s palms on two occasions, finishing the half strongly. They\u2019ll take some confidence from that. 45 min: Sadly the corner from Vaulks is dismal, hung high in the air, an easy one for Livakovic to pluck from the sky. 44 min: Wales finally have their tails up, Lawrence sending Smith off down the left. He earns a corner. What a time this would be to equalise! 42 min: And then, out of nothing, Wales nearly equalise! James has his first look down the left, checks back and curls one to the far post. Wilson hooks it back for the incoming Vaulks, who bundles an effort goalwards. Livakovic makes a real mess of the save, nearly clanking it off the lurking Davies and into the goal. But he gathers just in time. Still, much, much better from Wales, and that delicious deep cross from James will have got quite a few Manchester United fans excited. 40 min: Bale is showing signs of losing his rag. A couple of minutes ago, he bumped chests with Livakovic as the keeper gathered a long punt. Now he\u2019s shanking a wild pass up into the air in the midfield. A hot day alright. 38 min: Brozovic rolls a cheeky pass down the middle for Modric. The Croatian captain has no right to get in between the Welsh centre backs, but very nearly does so. His persistence doesn\u2019t quite pay off, as Mepham fights as hard as he can to ensure Modric can\u2019t flick a shot away. But that was close, and Wales really need to hear the half-time whistle. 36 min: Croatia are this close to a second. Allen loses the ball just inside the Croatian half. The hosts break with great purpose, Modric rolling a pass down the left for Kramaric, who strides towards the box, cuts inside, and sends a power curl towards the top right. Hennessey is beaten all ends up, but the ball whistles inches over the bar. That would have been a pretty picture. 34 min: Some more very slick possession play by Croatia. Wales can\u2019t get a touch. Faintly mesmeric under the hazy summer sun. 32 min: Perisic launches a diagonal pass towards Brekalo on the right. Brekalo\u2019s one step away from being able to keep it in play and hook it into the centre, but can\u2019t quite wrap his foot around the ball and it slices out for a goal kick. Once again, Wales are being burned down the flanks. 31 min: Bale has a little probe down the right, but to no great effect. The hosts are looking pretty comfortable. 29 min: The pace of the game has dropped suddenly, and significantly. Were members from the 1990 Argentinian World Cup squad at those drinks bottles? 27 min: Vaulks slips a pass down the inside-right channel with a view to releasing Bale, but the Wales captain is clearly offside. Up goes the flag. But at least Bale is moving freely after that injury scare. 25 min: And then a cooling break. Time out for drinks and cucumber sandwiches . 24 min: Bale has his toes flattened by the clumsy Kovacic. For a second it looks serious as he drums the ground with his fist in agony. But he\u2019s up again quickly enough, to great Welsh relief. 22 min: Croatia aren\u2019t too shabby down the right wing, either. Brozovic has a look along the flank, and his cross causes mild panic before it\u2019s hacked away. 20 min: Wales take the sting out of the game a little by faffing over a throw in the midfield. Time to regroup after the shock of conceding. 18 min: Croatia are causing havoc down this left wing. They\u2019re looking for Perisic short, they\u2019re looking for him long. And finding him most times. Roberts has a real job on today, and he\u2019s not getting too much support. Bale nearly wins a long ball on the edge of the Croatian box, but can\u2019t bring it down under pressure from Vida. Wilson tries to pick up the scraps, but is bowled over. A very light tug from Kovacic. He wants the foul, but he isn\u2019t getting it. And the non-decision really costs Wales, because the hosts stream up the other end. A long ball down the left sends Perisic away in acres. He reaches the box and contemplates a shot, but fires a low cross into the six-yard box instead. Lawrence, rushing back, takes his eye off the ball as it clanks onto his shins and into the net. To be fair, Kramaric was lurking, he had to do something. 15 min: Croatia continue to hog the ball. Barisic and Perisic combine well down the left, but Davies mops up in the middle and his keeper can gather. 13 min: Croatia work a short corner to Modric, who slips a pass inside for Perisic, just to the left of the D. It\u2019s half a chance, but he hoicks his shot wide left and screams in frustration. This has been a pleasingly open encounter so far. Both teams are trying to play their football. 12 min: Modric dances past a couple of half-arsed challenges in the midfield, then sprays a glorious pass wide right for Brekalo. A low cross fizzes through the six-yard box, and Mepham is forced to knock the ball out for a corner near his own left-hand post. 10 min: And so, after all that, it\u2019s Wales who get the first meaningful shot on target! There\u2019s some very quick thinking by Bale, who takes a quick throw from the right, near the halfway line. It\u2019s a long, athletic launch, and it finds Wilson on the edge of the box! Wilson gives the bouncing ball a good larrup, but it\u2019s straight at Livakovic, who claims easily enough. That was a very decent chance. 8 min: Perisic again. He zips down the left and makes enough space for a shot, albeit from a tight angle. He sends a riser over the bar. Hennessey had it covered. But there was some fizz in that strike. Perisic looks in the mood. 7 min: Wales win a throw in the midfield, a Lovren pass going astray, and the away fans erupt in good-natured irony. Their team has been chasing shadows on this very sunny day. Croatia are soon coming back at Wales, though, Kramaric nearly beating Mepham in a footrace down the inside-left channel ... but the Welsh centre-half holds his position well and shepherds the Croatian striker out of play. Goal kick. 5 min: More from Perisic, who is extremely busy in these opening exchanges. A shimmy and a shake, and both Roberts and Vaulks are sent the wrong way on the left. His cross is easy pickings for Hennessey, though. Wales will need to weather an early storm by the looks of it so far. 3 min: Wales haven\u2019t had a touch of note yet. There\u2019s a fine atmosphere at the Gradski vrt ... the City Garden. No time for Wales to stop and smell the flowers, though, as Perisic has another sniff down the left wing. His ball inside is cleared by Roberts. A minute\u2019s silence in memory of erstwhile Uefa bigwig Lennart Johansson ... perfectly observed ... and we\u2019re off! The hosts get this qualifier underway, and they\u2019re quickly on the front foot, Perisic making good ground down the left. There\u2019s a little bit of pinball in the Welsh box, but the visitors resist. Just 89 minutes and 30 seconds left to hold out. Here come the teams! The Welsh second kit is predominantly white, so Croatia politely change out of their iconic red-and-white chequerboard shirts and into their own alternative of black-and-navy check. Wales in red. Anthems are trilled, pennants are swapped, hands are clasped, and we\u2019ll be off before you know it! Ryan Giggs speaks ... and it\u2019s fairly clear he wants to play a possession-based game. \u201cThe conditions are going to play a part. It\u2019s hot, so we need to keep the ball. But we must recognise we\u2019re away from home, so we need to be solid. At times, dig in. But we want to keep the ball too. We\u2019ve got players who can hurt any opposition, so we want to get the ball to them as quickly as possible. Obviously if you\u2019re not keeping the ball, and you\u2019re constantly running about, it\u2019s going to affect you more than if you keep the ball and you get your rest when you have the ball. So a big emphasis on that. It\u2019s not going to be easy, it\u2019s good that we have water breaks, that\u2019ll help. But it\u2019s the same for both teams. We\u2019re ready, we\u2019ve had good preparations, and we\u2019re up for the challenge.\u201d Daniel James, on his way from Swansea City to Manchester United, starts after scoring the winner on his competitive debut against Slovakia in March. Wales make one change from that match, Will Vaulks coming in for David Brooks. Croatia made three changes from the team that went down 2-1 in Hungary three months ago. Ivan Rakitic and Ante Rebic are injured, while goalkeeper Lovre Kalinic drops to the bench; Dominik Livakovic, Mateo Kovacic and Josip Brekalo take their places. Croatia: Livakovic, Jedvaj, Lovren, Vida, Barisic, Modric, Brozovic, Brekalo, Kovacic, Perisic, Kramaric. Subs: Kalinic, Melnjak, Caleta-Car, Skoric, Benkovic, Pasalic, Halilovic, Caktas, Badelj, Petkovic, Bartolec, Sluga. Wales: Hennessey, Roberts, Mepham, Jamie Lawrence, Ben Davies, Wilson, Allen, Smith, James, Vaulks, Bale. Subs: Ward, Gunter, Neil Taylor, Ashley Williams, Vokes, Levitt, Brooks, Matondo, Ampadu, Tom Lawrence, Lockyer, Adam Davies. Referee: Istvan Kovacs (Romania). Croatia haven\u2019t really been at the races since becoming the second-smallest nation in history to reach a World Cup final last summer. In the aftermath of being dispatched by France in Moscow, they\u2019ve only won two competitive fixtures out of five: a rollercoaster 3-2 Nations League win over Spain in Zagreb that was comprehensively offset by a 6-0 defeat on the Spaniards\u2019 own turf, and a slim victory at home against Azerbaijan in their first Euro 2020 qualifier. All a bit post-Lord-Mayor\u2019s-show. That 2-1 win over the Azerbaijanis was swiftly followed by defeat in Hungary against a team, it\u2019s safe to say, still in transition in the wake of their 1954 World Cup heartache. Zlatko Dalic\u2019s men need to get back on the horse quicksmart if the 2018 World Cup runners-up aren\u2019t to miss the Euro 2020 party. There are quite a lot of good omens for Croatia, though. For starters, they\u2019ve never, ever, ever lost a European Championship qualifier at home! That\u2019s a 32-match run that stretches all the way back to 1994. They\u2019re also on something of a hot streak at home in general, unbeaten since 2013. They\u2019ve never been beaten by the Welsh, winning three of four matches and drawing the other. They\u2019ve never lost in Osijek, winning nine of 11. And it\u2019s expected to be hot. So this is a big ask for Wales, and a huge chance for Croatia to regain some momentum towards the Euros. \u201cWe recognise we\u2019re up against it,\u201d says Ryan Giggs. \u201cBut we\u2019re ready.\u201d Can they stun Croatia by making it two wins from two in Group E, following a narrow home win over Slovakia secured by Manchester United new boy Daniel James? Kick-off is at 2pm. It\u2019s on!",

At first he was charming, but gradually the abuse began. He bullied and humiliated her, isolated her from her friends and family, controlled who she could socialise with, controlled her money, restricted her movement and created a culture of fear and dependency. Our father fed into our mother\u2019s mind that the abuse she was suffering over 40 years was normal.</p> <p>While he forced strict restrictions on her behaviour, he would have numerous affairs and visit brothels. If she challenged him, he would gaslight her, make her question her sanity and seek to control us as sons to believe our mother was mad.</p> <p>When coercive control became an offence in 2015 it crucially helped enshrine in law a deeper understanding of abuse and helped provide a language for not only what my brother and I witnessed but also for neighbours, friends and family, as well as our father\u2019s family and his oldest friend, all of whose original statements were given context to describe one of the worst cases of coercive control to be heard.</p> <p>Since that moment, as brothers we have campaigned to bring to light a true understanding of the events that led to our father\u2019s death and raise awareness of this form of abuse. Our mother\u2019s actions, we argued, were not led by the emotions of jealousy nor rage but stemmed from a lifelong campaign of fear and psychological abuse waged by our father for more than 40 years through his coercive controlling behaviour.</p> <p>How has our mother\u2019s case come to be so inaccurately portrayed by the criminal justice system? Why do we continue to label women who kill as jealous, cold murderers and refuse to explore evidence of abuse?</p> <p>Simple narratives heard at the original trial of our mother counting our father\u2019s Viagra pills and tracking his movements to prove his continuous cheating suddenly became narratives of her control and jealousy that ultimately led to calculated murder. These stories continued for nine years to last February when her case was heard at the Court of Appeal. With so much public interest, the court overflowed, forcing the case to be moved to a larger court. Many of the supporters who attended were there to see justice finally come for our mother, many personally affected by abuse themselves. The prosecution argued our mother could not have been struggling with a mental disorder as she was functioning to a high standard at the time of the killing. This caused an audible uproar in the gallery \u2013 victims of abuse present there were outraged. Dangerous myths about victims of domestic violence who appear well put together and judged to be unaffected are continuously played out in open court.</p> <p>Such was the case in November, when after a court heard how Paul Measor, 35, spat on his partner Lauren Smith, 24, tracked her movements via a phone app he forced her to install and isolated her from friends, the judge ruled his actions did not have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on Smith\u2019s life. Measor was only sentenced on two charges of common assault and jailed for five months.</p> <p>If you\u2019re a woman, these are the narratives of such cases, where abuse is often not explored or even understood and women who kill are painted as cold-blooded murderers.</p> <p>Farieissia Martin was 22 when she was convicted of the murder of Kyle Farrell in 2015, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Martin, who at the time had two small children with Farrell, grabbed a knife when he tried to strangle her. Farrell\u2019s violence often left Martin in fear of her life, but she was too frightened to call the police in case social services became involved and removed her children. Farrell\u2019s history of violence was not adequately explored during the trial. <a href=\"http://www.justiceforwomen.org.uk\" title=\"\">Justice for Women</a> is campaigning for the case to go to appeal, on the grounds that the evidence of domestic violence was not afforded enough significance during the trial.</p> <p>The overwhelming support my brother and I have received from the public from the very moment we chose to speak out about the abuse our mother suffered shows that as a society we are now starting to understand coercive control. The fact that society is ahead of the CPS in understanding domestic violence is a damaging indictment of the criminal justice system. This is at a time when the Domestic Abuse Bill seeks to bring about real change yet we are cutting legal aid for victims of abuse. When the criminal justice system fails to recognise abuse in these cases, it is failing to protect both victims of abuse and the perpetrators they kill. Another child will go through what my brother and I have endured, suffering the death of one parent and the failure to recognise the abuse of the other.</p> <p>It is best perhaps put by my mother, who upon being recognised as a victim of abuse and set free last week said: \u201cMany other women who are victims of abuse and violence are in prison today serving life sentences, and I know this because I have met them. They have suffered abuse and other miscarriages of justice and should be serving sentences for manslaughter and not murder.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.justiceforwomen.org.uk\" title=\"\">justiceforwomen.org.uk</a></em></p>",

He bullied and humiliated her, isolated her from her friends and family, controlled who she could socialise with, controlled her money, restricted her movement and created a culture of fear and dependency. Our father fed into our mother\u2019s mind that the abuse she was suffering over 40 years was normal. While he forced strict restrictions on her behaviour, he would have numerous affairs and visit brothels. If she challenged him, he would gaslight her, make her question her sanity and seek to control us as sons to believe our mother was mad. When coercive control became an offence in 2015 it crucially helped enshrine in law a deeper understanding of abuse and helped provide a language for not only what my brother and I witnessed but also for neighbours, friends and family, as well as our father\u2019s family and his oldest friend, all of whose original statements were given context to describe one of the worst cases of coercive control to be heard. Since that moment, as brothers we have campaigned to bring to light a true understanding of the events that led to our father\u2019s death and raise awareness of this form of abuse. Our mother\u2019s actions, we argued, were not led by the emotions of jealousy nor rage but stemmed from a lifelong campaign of fear and psychological abuse waged by our father for more than 40 years through his coercive controlling behaviour. How has our mother\u2019s case come to be so inaccurately portrayed by the criminal justice system? Why do we continue to label women who kill as jealous, cold murderers and refuse to explore evidence of abuse? Simple narratives heard at the original trial of our mother counting our father\u2019s Viagra pills and tracking his movements to prove his continuous cheating suddenly became narratives of her control and jealousy that ultimately led to calculated murder. These stories continued for nine years to last February when her case was heard at the Court of Appeal. With so much public interest, the court overflowed, forcing the case to be moved to a larger court. Many of the supporters who attended were there to see justice finally come for our mother, many personally affected by abuse themselves. The prosecution argued our mother could not have been struggling with a mental disorder as she was functioning to a high standard at the time of the killing. This caused an audible uproar in the gallery \u2013 victims of abuse present there were outraged. Dangerous myths about victims of domestic violence who appear well put together and judged to be unaffected are continuously played out in open court. Such was the case in November, when after a court heard how Paul Measor, 35, spat on his partner Lauren Smith, 24, tracked her movements via a phone app he forced her to install and isolated her from friends, the judge ruled his actions did not have a \u201cserious effect\u201d on Smith\u2019s life. Measor was only sentenced on two charges of common assault and jailed for five months. If you\u2019re a woman, these are the narratives of such cases, where abuse is often not explored or even understood and women who kill are painted as cold-blooded murderers. Farieissia Martin was 22 when she was convicted of the murder of Kyle Farrell in 2015, and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Martin, who at the time had two small children with Farrell, grabbed a knife when he tried to strangle her. Farrell\u2019s violence often left Martin in fear of her life, but she was too frightened to call the police in case social services became involved and removed her children. Farrell\u2019s history of violence was not adequately explored during the trial. Justice for Women is campaigning for the case to go to appeal, on the grounds that the evidence of domestic violence was not afforded enough significance during the trial. The overwhelming support my brother and I have received from the public from the very moment we chose to speak out about the abuse our mother suffered shows that as a society we are now starting to understand coercive control. The fact that society is ahead of the CPS in understanding domestic violence is a damaging indictment of the criminal justice system. This is at a time when the Domestic Abuse Bill seeks to bring about real change yet we are cutting legal aid for victims of abuse. When the criminal justice system fails to recognise abuse in these cases, it is failing to protect both victims of abuse and the perpetrators they kill. Another child will go through what my brother and I have endured, suffering the death of one parent and the failure to recognise the abuse of the other. It is best perhaps put by my mother, who upon being recognised as a victim of abuse and set free last week said: \u201cMany other women who are victims of abuse and violence are in prison today serving life sentences, and I know this because I have met them. They have suffered abuse and other miscarriages of justice and should be serving sentences for manslaughter and not murder.\u201d justiceforwomen.org.uk",

France got off to a flyer and now Germany, the free-scoring Olympic champions, plan to follow. They begin their quest for further glory in Group B, against China. The two-time winners were knocked out in the semi-finals in 2015 \u2013 and in the quarter-finals of the European Championship in 2017 \u2013 but remain No 2 in the world. Germany boast a degree of stardust in Dzsenifer Marozsan, a Hungarian-born midfielder. Already a European champion after helping Lyon to Champions League success, she scooped the French league\u2019s player of the year award for the third season in a row and was third in the inaugural vote for the women\u2019s Ballon d\u2019Or. As for China, they boast their own midfield powerhouse: Wang Shuang, who arrived at Paris Saint-Germain to much fanfare. There is further encouragement too, given they have reached at least the quarter-finals in each of their previous six World Cup appearances. </p> <p><strong>Kick-off: </strong>2pm (BST)</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T11:46:17.947Z\">at 12.46pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "Read the match report from Rennes: And then it\u2019s Norway v Nigeria later, 8pm (BST): The fun and games are not over. Far from it: Get a load of this swanky interactive. Fill yer boots: Giulia Gwinn\u2019s belting strike is the difference in Rennes. Germany are up-and-running \u2013 but they were certainly made to work for victory, riding their luck at times, particularly at the end of the first half when China rattled the woodwork. But Germany\u2019s pressure eventually told, with Gwinn firing home from just outside the box. The Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Wang Shuang came on at the interval but, as it turned out, there was only room for one superstar: Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n, the majestic Lyon midfielder. 90+3 min: Last chance saloon for China. They win a corner ... 90 min: There will be three minutes added time. Germany are determined to eke out victory, knocking the ball around without too many grand plans. They are going to sit on their one-goal lead. 88 min: Wang Shuang sends a low corner into the box and Doorsoun lashes the ball away. Anywhere will do-style. This game, it is fair to say, has fizzled out. 87 min: For a moment, Gu Yasha is in \u2013 but again she dallies on the ball far too long the chance is gone. China do win a corner, though. 85 min: Svenja Huth is replaced by Lea Sch\u00fcller, as Germany make their third and final change of the afternoon in Rennes. Sch\u00fcller was her country\u2019s joint-top scorer in qualifying, alongside the influential skipper, Alexandra Popp. 84 min: Marozsan, the Lyon star, is on the end of another late challenge on halfway. That is a compliment, right? She might not feel that way. 82 min: Gu Yasha delivers the ball from the left, a good 25 yards from goal but it is not too brilliant. They do manage to recycle possession, with Wang Shuang handing over the baton to Zhang, who drives at goal. It was always rising. 82 min: Oberdorf, the 17-year-old substitute, drags down another sub, Wang Shuang. China have a chance to swing the ball in from a free-kick ... 81 min: China\u2019s supporters in Rennes are making a racket \u2013 but since going behind they failed to penetrate the German defence. That Gwinn goal has knocked the stuffing out of them. 78 min: A flurry of half-chances for Germany, as the goalscorer Gwinn eyes another. She drives goalwards from an acute angle but Peng Shimeng is equal to it. Other than a wild start, the China goalkeeper has had a decent game. 77 min: Svenja Huth does the hard part, driving into the box after being slipped in by Marozsan. She cuts the ball back \u2013 but is offside. 74 min: The ball sits up nicely for Sara D\u00e4britz on the edge of the area but her effort is a daisy-cutter at best. China rallied back in numbers quickly. Over the public address system, they confirm a crowd of more than 15,000 here in Rennes. 73 min: Svenja Huth wellies an effort into Row Q. 71 min: That goal has settled Germany down. The purring Marozsan, who has been a class act throughout, has just sent a wondrous ball arcing across the pitch. They are in the mood now. The challenge is to build on their one-goal lead. 69 min: How will China respond? Well, for starters Yang Li, who struck a post in the first half, is withdrawn and replaced by Song. The teenager thumps the Germans ahead. A Marozsan corner culminates in the ball dropping to the edge of the box, where Giulia Gwinn is lurking. She controls the ball with her first touch, steadying herself to hammer home a rasping shot with her next. A stunning strike \u2013 Peng Shimeng had no chance in the China goal. The 19-year-old Freiburg winger absolutely buried it. 63 min: Magull, one of Germany\u2019s Bayern Munich contingent, replaces Leupolz, whose last action found her on the receiving end of a shove by Yang Li. 61 min: Alexandra Popp, the Germany captain, has a, er, pop at Gu Yasha after the China midfielder had a nibble at the forward while on the floor. Popp had picked the ball up, assuming she would earn a foul but the Canadian referee gave it the other way. It is not quite happening for Germany. 59 min: Hegering swings a leg at a loose ball in the box \u2013 but China manage to hook it away. It stemmed from another fine Marozsan corner, after good work by Gwinn. This game has certainly not been short of chances \u2013 but no breakthrough. Yet. 56 min: Peng Shimeng pushes the ball away from danger! Hendrich arrived late at the back post, attempted to stab Oberdorf\u2019s ball home but the Germany defender could not make any meaningful contact \u2013 if any \u2013 to prod it in. Other than that, China have started where they left off, shading a finely-poised encounter. 55 min: Away from Rennes for a moment, a bit of breaking news: Fifa have issued a life ban and 1m CHF (Swiss franc) fine to the former Afghan football president Keramuudin Karim, for the sexual abuse of \u201cvarious female players\u201d \u2013 the harshest penalty available. 52 min: Germany still look a bit wobbly. Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, the manager, is hardly jumping up and down on the touchline. Introducing a teenager for her major tournament debut is a considerable show of faith, too. 48 min: China try to play their way out of trouble but get caught in doing so, inviting Germany to pile on the pressure for the first time this half. Svenja Huth wins a free-kick down the right, with Liu Shanshan booked for a lunge on the forward. 46 min: Back under way, and a change apiece for Germany and China. Carolin Simon has been replaced by the 17-year-old, Lena Oberdorf. China have also tweaked personnel, introducing Paris Saint-Germain superstar Wang Shuang, the only player in their ranks to play outside of her homeland. And in the blue corner! Scotland fancy their chances, too: Essential half-time reading: time for a quick look ahead, to England v Scotland in Nice on Sunday, with Phil Neville\u2019s side determined to make a splash in their Group D opener: An entertaining first half draws to a close \u2013 and somehow it is still goalless, with both sides having hit the woodwork. Germany started like a train in Rennes, with Alexandra Popp and Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n causing problems but a resolute China came back fighting and, by the end of the first period, they had the second-best team in the world very much on the ropes. Yang Li squandered two big chances and made Germany suffer late on. 45+2 min: Another chance for China goes to waste! They work the ball across to Gu Yasha, who has peeled off Hendrich, the absent Germany right-back, but she dallies on it too long, preferring to pass rather than leather the ball at goal. Germany are allowed a route back in and eventually smother the ball. 45 min: There will be four added minutes. 44 min: China strike a post! Yang Li curls a first-time effort at goal but it cannons off the upright! A huge let-off for Germany, who were at sixes and sevens at the back, allowing China to play in Li in acres of space. A comedy of errors ensued after the ball came bouncing off the woodwork, and the Germany goalkeeper ends up taking a whack from Li who attempted to poke home the rebound. 41 min: Germany play with fire, allowing China to jink in off the left flank and they almost do some damage. They slip in Yang Li but the striker is ousted off the ball by a bit of mean German defending by Doorsoun. There are a couple of half-hearted shouts for a penalty but the referee Beadouin is having none of it. 39 min: Marozsan causes havoc again, with her ball finding Popp but the Germany captain cannot carve out enough room to fire at goal. China do well to surround the skipper, making life difficult and eventually crowding her out. The Germany coach, Martina Voss-Tecklenburg, looks on rather nervously. 34 min: Ruyin Tan goes crashing in on Sara D\u00e4britz. The China substitute\u2019s first act is to clatter the unsuspecting Germany midfielder on halfway, which leaves D\u00e4britz feeling the full force of a hefty challenge. Another, er, agricultural attempted tackle. 33 min: And Lou being screened by the referee is her last contribution: the China midfielder jogs off to be replaced by Tan. 32 min: Germany pour forward again \u2013 but China stand firm. In the buildup to the move, a routine pass on halfway zipped across the turf with the referee Beaudouin inadvertently blocking off the China midfielder Lou Jiahui, who took a whack on the foot a moment ago. Thankfully, it did not come to anything. 29 min: Peng punches away another gorgeous Marozsan delivery. The Lyon playmaker has been at the heart of all of Germany\u2019s good work. Meanwhile, some news out of the Brazil press conference: Marta is out of their group opener against Jamaica on Sunday, when England also take on Scotland. 26 min: Germany are edging closer to a breakthrough, as Svenja Huth cuts in off the left flank to bend a shot at goal. It is always rising but zooms just over the crossbar. China allowed Huth to bounce in off the wing all too easily. 23 min: China hack the ball off the line! Marozsan\u2019s corner comes flying into the near post and the ball pinballs off a couple of red shirts but somehow the ball bounces away from danger \u2013 Germany, and Popp in particular, cannot believe it. And then China make a better fist of clearing another corner second time around. 19 min: Simon pops up in a more orthodox position down the left flank. She curves another teasing ball towards the back post, where Alexandra Popp is lurking. The Germany captain rises highest to make contact with it \u2013 but her header bounces on to the roof of the net. It was not the cleanest of contact, with Popp taking a thud from the China goalkeeper Peng Shimeng. Popp limps to the sidelines for a dab of treatment but the Wolfburg striker is fine. 17 min: Germany rattle the crossbar! They play a short corner, with Carolin Simon given time and space to bend a left-footed cross into the box \u2013 but it almost ends up floating into the top corner. Another left-off, this time for China. 14 min: And China pass up the game\u2019s best chance! A golden opportunity goes begging. Sara Doorsoun-Khajeh\u2019s weak cross-field ball gifts China the chance to break forward, three-on three. After countering at speed, it eventually drops to Yang Li but she fails to bury it, and the ball is deflected wide for a corner, with Doorsoun, the Wolfsburg midfielder, diving in to make amends. China simply took too long to get a shot away. 13 min: Marozsan, back up and grooving, swivels on the ball 25 yards out and almost releases Popp \u2013 but fails to execute the killer pass. It is a little wayward and China survive. A touch of class by Marozsan, who has looked very good every time she has got on the ball. And now China pour forward down the other end ... 11 min: A rash challenge by Wang Shanhan on Marozsan leaves Germany\u2019s prized asset in a heap. It was a very late attempt at nicking the ball away. The Chinese No 11 gets a booking, a just reward. Marozsan shakes her head in disbelief but gets back up on to her feet. Germany are yet to get out of first gear. 9 min: Germany attempt to pile on the pressure but Sara D\u00e4britz\u2019s downfield pass is heavy. China\u2019s eyes lit up a moment ago, afforded the chance to make a rare foray towards the Germany 18-yard line but the move broke down quickly. 6 min: Svenja Huth does well for Germany, shuffling down the left before working the ball into Marozsan. Huth looks for the reverse pass but the Lyon midfielder just undercooks the return ball. China \u2013 just about \u2013 manage to clear their lines in time. A front-foot start by the Germans, as expected. 4 min: China are struggling to get out of their own half, with Germany\u2019s tails very much up after a couple of early raids forward. It is all bit harum-scarum in the China defence. Germany look calm and composed, but are aggressive in their pressing. 3 min: A smart effort from 20 yards by D\u00e4britz, a rasping drive from just outside of the box. It drops just wide of the China goal but, once more, it was a case of heart in mouth stuff in their defence. Germany have made a solid start. 2 min: Peng Shimeng comes rushing out of goal but fails to truly deal with a neat, whipped ball from the right. It darts across goal but China come away unscathed. It was not the most convincing of goalkeeping by the Peng. 1 min: The Germany captain Popp is little overzealous in the challenge, with a high foot on the defender Yin and China win an early free-kick. China get things started. We are just the national anthems away from the off in Rennes. Here we go ... For China, Wang Shuang is certainly worth looking out for. Sometimes referred to, rather flatteringly, as \u201cthe female Leo Messi\u201d in her homeland, she has shone in France. The forward ended her first season at Paris Saint-Germain with seven goals and eight assists in 18 appearances in Ligue 1 and one goal and one assist in the Champions League. She was voted the AFC Women\u2019s Player of the Year in 2018 and, at 24, is the symbol of Chinese women\u2019s football\u2019s rejuvenation. Time for a bit more on Dzsenifer Marozs\u00e1n, who has the talent to singlehandedly steer Germany all the way: the Lyon midfielder is universally considered one of the best women\u2019s playmakers on the planet and, at 27, is now in her prime. The youngest player ever to appear in a Bundesliga game when she was 15, she has won the Champions League both with Frankfurt and Lyon and has been voted the best player in the French league twice \u2013 ahead of standout teammates such as Ada Hegerberg and Eug\u00e9nie Le Sommer. She is back at her best despite missing three months in the summer of 2018 due to a life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

      "body": "<p>Perhaps the most intriguing exhibit in Cindy Sherman\u2019s forthcoming retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery is the first, <em>Cindy Book</em>, a family photo album she began making when she was just six years old. It comprises 26 snapshots pasted on pages torn out of a school exercise book and placed inside stapled-together plain covers that are now stained and discoloured with age. For all sorts of reasons, it is a good place to start.</p> <p>There is no artifice in the actual photographs. They trace ordinary moments in Sherman\u2019s early life from infancy to adolescence: cute baby pics, family gatherings, snaps of her as a child at the beach and portraits of her as a teenager standing gauchely alongside awkward young men. What is striking is the sense of an almost stereotypical all-American suburban childhood. As is always the case with Sherman, though, nothing is quite what it seems.</p> <p>In green ink, she has circled herself in each photo and underneath written \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d. That comma is fascinating, perhaps a child\u2019s grammatical error, yet already implying, as curator Paul Moorhouse notes in his catalogue essay, \u201can unfolding process\u201d. When Sherman rediscovered <em>Cindy Book</em> as a 21-year-old art student, the process unfolded some more, as she added extra photos to the album and, as she puts it, made \u201cthe handwriting seem to grow up along with the images\u201d. Does she consider the original handmade album the beginning of her long and singular art practice (\u201cThat\u2019s me, or is it?\u201d) or does it start in earnest with the later intervention?</p> <p>\u201cThe original book is interesting to me because it was more about my fascination with our family snapshots,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were kept in a shoebox and, as a child, I loved to pore over them looking for pictures of myself as a baby, but also to identify all these characters that existed before I was born. There was such a big age gap between my older siblings and myself, so I think now I was somehow finding myself in the family through the snapshots. When I came back to the album as a student, that was definitely the more knowing artist coming into play.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"45708901a179f857991f5e0f1e00c3fbec997f6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45708901a179f857991f5e0f1e00c3fbec997f6e/1991_18_895_1119/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pages from A Cindy Book, c1964 \u201375.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pages from A Cindy Book, c1964 \u201375.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy the artist/ Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Somewhere between those two creative impulses, one instinctive and psychologically revealing, the other conceptual and wilfully deceptive, may lie the enduring fascination of Sherman\u2019s art. For nigh on 50 years, on the strength of one enduringly brilliant idea \u2013 turning the camera on her transformed self in order to exaggerate and illuminate the archetypes that are all around us, so familiar as to go almost unnoticed \u2013 Sherman has been hiding in plain sight as one of the great artists of our time. In that time, she has redefined photographic portraiture, her approach being, as her friend the writer and editor Ingrid Sischy noted in 1991, more akin to that of a cinematic auteur. \u201cShe\u2019s the director, the producer, the set designer, the costume mistress, and the star as well... In her hands, images aren\u2019t straitjackets but vehicles to show the infinite possibilities of who she could be.\u201d</p> <p>As the NPG retrospective will show, hers is an art of shape-shifting and disguise, artifice and camouflage. It draws on high and low culture: European and Hollywood films, 1950s television sitcoms, art history, high society, fashion, forensic science, drag, pinups and pornography; the esoteric and the everyday, the glamorous and the grotesque. All her major series are here, from the still resonant Untitled Film Stills, which she began when she first moved to New York in the late 70s, through the controversial Centerfolds, the even more controversial Sex Pictures (surely the most grotesquely provocative images ever exhibited in the gallery), the acerbic Fashion pictures, the History Portraits, the Flappers and the Street Style Stars.</p> <p>Seeing her creative journey unfold, from her use of cheap wigs and secondhand clothes through her discovery of prosthetics and on to her current <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cindysherman/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Instagram experiments in digital face manipulation</a>, what really fascinates is the consistent cultural resonance of her work. \u201cSherman\u2019s target is the look of the modern world,\u201d notes Moorhouse, \u201cwith whose manufactured character she evidently has a love\u2013hate relationship.\u201d And, if her personas have often echoed the way in which our image-obsessed culture has elevated style and appearance, they have also of late become freighted with new meaning in the so-called post-truth age, as the idea of the blatantly fake has taken on more ominous meaning, becoming an acceptable part of our degraded political discourse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5aaf9711e111ae31a70ab51fef4221c62faa455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5aaf9711e111ae31a70ab51fef4221c62faa455/0_0_4800_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled #92 by Cindy Sherman, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled #92 by Cindy Sherman, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As an interviewee, Sherman is incredibly accommodating, but somehow elusive, upbeat but slightly detached. A friend once memorably described her as having \u201cthe banality of a great actress\u201d, which may be a clever way of keeping the world at bay, but one can see why she connected with the art-rocker David Byrne \u2013 they were an item for several years \u2013 who evinces a similar kind of not quite normal normalness.</p> <p>Before that, she was married for 15 years to video artist Michel Auder, who was addicted to heroin for most of the relationship. They split up in 1999. She described a subsequent short relationship with struggling film-maker Paul H-O as \u201creal fucked-up\u201d. She is currently contentedly single, sharing her Manhattan loft apartment and her house in the Hamptons with a macaw called Mister Frieda, which she has owned for nearly 28 years. \u201cHe\u2019s been the longest companion I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said recently, \u201calthough it\u2019s like having a perpetual two-year-old.\u201d</p> <p>Sherman came of age when postmodern theory occupied a place in art discourse that it no longer does; perhaps this is why her work has endured much better than some of her peers: because of its implicit \u2013 and sometimes explicit \u2013 feminist politics. \u201cI\u2019m not personally articulate,\u201d she says when I mention this. \u201cI don\u2019t even like giving lectures, and I certainly couldn\u2019t debate with anyone, but I have strong personal stances. I couldn\u2019t be an advocate but, through my work, I can be outspoken. What\u2019s also important, though, is that the work is always ambiguous, that it lends itself to interpretation. I\u2019m not a message artist.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d45459ccfb7dc96f3bc852e4a192ea980115a18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d45459ccfb7dc96f3bc852e4a192ea980115a18/0_172_2657_2656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cindy Sherman and her macaw Mister Frieda in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cindy Sherman and her macaw, Mister Frieda, in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sonia Moskowitz/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That much was clear from the start. Likewise the love-hate relationship with her subject matter that Moorhouse identifies. Both, as with her fascination with dressing up, may have their roots in her childhood. Born in New Jersey in 1954 and raised in Long Island, she grew up in thrall to Hollywood B-movies and television sitcoms of the time, many of which portrayed suburban America as an idyll of domesticity, traditional family values and untrammelled aspiration.</p> <p>\u201cI remember, as a child, being drawn to shows like <em>I Love Lucy</em>,\u201d she recalls, \u201cbut, even then, realising the artifice in them, the goofy sentiment of all those perfect mums with the perfect homes and perfect men. Growing up in the actual suburbs made me look at what was being portrayed and realise that it was fake. So I was both attracted and repulsed by those films and shows. I think that paradox somehow found its way into the work.\u201d</p> <p>The young Cynthia Sherman\u2019s family dynamic was complex. Her father, an aircraft engineer, was 49 and her mother, a high-school teacher, 45 when she was born. She was the youngest of five children, all of whom were much older \u2013 19 years separated Cynthia from her eldest sibling. She first began dressing up as a young child, often in the sanctuary of her bedroom. Was it, I ask, a form of attention-seeking, maybe even a cry for help? \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve talked about in therapy in recent years,\u201d she says, matter of factly. \u201cI know that I wasn\u2019t dressing up to entertain my family. It was more about me thinking, maybe they\u2019ll like me better this way. I guess I felt I wasn\u2019t accepted somehow. My parents had thought they were done with raising children when I came along. I don\u2019t think I picked up on all that until I began talking about it to my therapist.\u201d</p> <p>In past interviews, Sherman has described her childhood as normal and happy, which is certainly the sense you get from the <em>Cindy Book</em>. However, in one interview, she described her father as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/05/15/her-secret-identities\" title=\"\">\u201ca creep\u201d who \u201cwould criticise with hate\u201d</a> and, in another, called him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jan/15/cindy-sherman-interview\" title=\"\">\u201ca bigot\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d</a>. As an adolescent, she experienced family tragedy up close, when her brother Frank took his own life. He had moved back into the family home in his mid-20s and belatedly bonded with his younger sister, who was 15 and had just made the decision to apply to art school when it happened. His death inevitably casts a long shadow. In 2016, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/03/cindy-sherman-interview-retrospective-motivation\" title=\"\">the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/03/cindy-sherman-interview-retrospective-motivation\" title=\"\">Observer\u2019s</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jul/03/cindy-sherman-interview-retrospective-motivation\" title=\"\"> Tim Adams broached the subject</a>, she burst into tears and spoke of her subsequent time at art college as a kind of therapy.</p> <p>In 1972, she began studying for an art degree at Buffalo State College, where she initially excelled at drawing and painting but, ironically, failing the compulsory photography course because of her lack of technical skills. When forced to repeat it, she came under the tutelage of Barbara Jo Revelle, the first person to make her aware of conceptualism. \u201cShe felt that to have an idea was what mattered,\u201d Sherman told the <em>New Yorker</em> in 2000, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/05/15/her-secret-identities\" title=\"\">\u201cand right away that made so much more sense to me\u201d</a>. </p> <p>At Buffalo State College, Sherman began going out with an older artist, Robert Longo, and it was in their shared apartment that she made the first picture of herself \u2013 \u201cstark naked, like a deer in the headlights\u201d \u2013 as a way to confront her own suburban prudishness. In 1974, while working as an assistant in the nonprofit gallery Hallwalls she set up with Longo and others, she began turning up to openings disguised as someone else in thrift-shop clothes and makeup, standing quietly and without explanation amid the art works.</p> <p>The pair moved to New York soon afterwards, living in a loft in Fulton Street in lower Manhattan in the shadow of the newly built World Trade Center, when rents were cheap and the now-gentrified neighbourhood was a ghost town after dark. \u201cI never felt scared walking home at 4am,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no one to rob, so there were no criminals.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8a9e7093d5af1d398114ea45d69b8964231a8935\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a9e7093d5af1d398114ea45d69b8964231a8935/0_0_3571_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled Film Still #56, 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled Film Still #56, 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At first, she stayed in a lot, dressing up and taking pictures of herself. For a time, she worked as a receptionist in a downtown gallery, Artists Space, again sometimes turning up in disguise \u2013 once in a nurse\u2019s outfit, another time as a 1950s secretary. One day, she showed a small selection of her photographs to the gallery director, Helene Winer, who told her she was on to something. It was the beginning of what would become her breakthrough series, Untitled Film Stills, in which she posed as archetypal characters from American B-movies and European art house films: the femme fatale, the bored housewife, the city girl, the vamp.</p> <p>Despite their postmodern knowingness, those early images still fascinate. The generic female characters she inhabits \u2013 furtive film actresses, harassed looking housewives, prim librarians \u2013 are ambiguous creations, identifiable as archetypes of femininity but also marooned from their contexts, freeze-framed in some bigger, more mysterious narrative. They are photography as elaborate performance: cerebral, ironic, deadpan. As in all of the series that follow, Sherman is present in the images as photographer, art director and performer, but absent insofar as they tell us nothing about her in the way a traditional self-portrait might. Instead, they are pure persona.</p> <p>\u201cMy early work was more about creating still lifes in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cOver time, it\u2019s become more about portraiture, but it\u2019s never been about self-portraiture because I don\u2019t feel like it is revealing anything of myself. It\u2019s about obscuring my identity, erasing or obliterating myself. It\u2019s not fantasy or pretending or narcissism. It\u2019s not about me.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/may/30/cindy-sherman-clowning-around-and-socialite-selfies-in-pictures\">Cindy Sherman: clowning around and socialite selfies \u2013\u00a0in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alongside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/03/jeff-wall-photography-marian-goodman-gallery-show\" title=\"\">Jeff Wall</a>, whose elaborately staged scenarios echoed traditional documentary photography while simultaneously subverting its style and its supposed truthfulness, Sherman made photography into a conceptual art form by foregrounding its deceptiveness (\u201cI know the camera always lies,\u201d she once said). Though not much commented upon, there is an element of play, as well as playacting, in all she does. \u201cOh yes. It\u2019s fun,\u201d she says, cheerily. \u201cIt\u2019s literally playing in my studio. That\u2019s why I like to work alone, because I can be less inhibited. I often don\u2019t know what I want until the end. It\u2019s very liberating.\u201d</p> <p>Can she remember the initial thrill of finding her own style, her language? \u201cInitially, it was just me retreating into my room and playing with makeup for fun. It was Longo who told me I should document my transformation from my normal self, which was masculine and boyish, to this vamp. When I did that, people were immediately interested. That\u2019s when I could really say: this is my art.\u201d</p> <p>The transformation was not altogether straightforward, though, as she elaborates. \u201cI thought I had found my place as an artist, but the problem was that, back then, photography was not a medium that was condoned by the art world. I felt I really wasn\u2019t accepted in the art or the photography world because I wasn\u2019t either.\u201d</p> <p>When did that change? \u201cNot until the early 90s.\u201d Really? That late? \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, still sounding slightly indignant. \u201cI remember, back in the early 80s, I was included in a group show at MoMA and certain collectors saying, \u2018I love your work, but I don\u2019t collect photography.\u2019\u201d She pauses and, then, laughing, adds: \u201cIn fact, someone said that to me just a few weeks ago in Venice during the Biennale. It still happens, but rarely.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a14ec233e71102c196bdbfee95098d0dd9e812b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a14ec233e71102c196bdbfee95098d0dd9e812b6/0_0_2400_4647/516.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled #307, 1994.\" width=\"516\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled #307, 1994.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy the artist /  Metro Pictures, New York/Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These days, though, it no longer rankles. In 2011, Sherman made headlines when one of her Centrefolds series, <em>Untitled </em><em>#96</em>, sold at auction for $3.89m, making it the most expensive photograph ever at that time. (It has since been superseded by Andreas Gursky\u2019s <em>Rhein II</em> and Richard Prince\u2019s <em>Spiritual America</em>, but five of her other works feature in the top 20 most expensive photographs of all time.) \u201cI didn\u2019t start to feel super-successful,\u201d she says, \u201cuntil I did the paintings show.\u201d (She\u2019s referring to the History Portraits, which she completed in 1990, using prosthetics as well as wigs, makeup and period costumes, to recreate the style of old master artworks.)</p> <p>\u201cI think they sold,\u201d she adds, pointedly, \u201cbecause they looked like old paintings.\u201d That must have been satisfying, though. \u201cIn a way, yes, but their popularity made me feel very guilty. I went straight into the Sex Pictures afterwards.\u201d</p> <p>The Sex Pictures (1992), alongside an earlier series that has come to be known as her Disaster pictures (1986-89), represent two viscerally angry, but nevertheless complex, responses to her own success in an art market not immune to peddling bad art in the guise of provocation. The latter series is both intentionally tasteless and compositionally intriguing: rotten food, vomit and fake body parts all photographed up-close and large-scale so that, from a distance, they look like abstractions. Intriguingly, she was mostly absent from the meticulously constructed ugliness, appearing as a ghostly reflection, as if aghast at the horror of it all.</p> <p>For the Sex Pictures, she used prosthetic penises, vaginas, sex toys and distorted limbs ordered from a catalogue of medical dummies used in teaching. \u201cI had already been collecting fake tits and asses for years,\u201d she says breezily, \u201cbecause I thought that at some point I could do really explicit nudity, but not of myself.\u201d</p> <p>The work features all the motifs of hardcore pornography but rendered grotesquely unreal and all the more unsettling for that. It was in part a response to the culture wars of the late 1980s, when the National Endowment for the Arts came under intense pressure from the Christian right for funding \u201cinappropriate\u201d work by the likes of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. It was also a riposte to Jeff Koons\u2019s Made in Heaven series, which comprised pornographic photographs of the artist and his bride to be, porn star Ilona \u2018Cicciolina\u201d Staller. \u201cI found them so lame and tame and not shocking at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just made me kind of angry.\u201d</p> <p>The Sex Pictures leap out of the catalogue for the NPG show, their visceral power to shock and disturb undiminished by the years. Their elaborate unrealness somehow makes them more shocking than Koons\u2019s empty porn pastiche or even the most hardcore photograph by Mapplethorpe. I can\u2019t imagine they were fun to make, though. \u201cI guess in a different way, they were, because I also enjoy doing the really difficult things that people can\u2019t buy. It\u2019s a reaction against the commerce of the art world, because I do feel guilty about it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a9a498df63cbc432e5d514cc6f2e676b5df32817\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9a498df63cbc432e5d514cc6f2e676b5df32817/32_31_2335_3061/763.jpg\" alt=\"Untitled #204, from the History Portraits series, 1988-90.\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Untitled #204, from the History Portraits series, 1988-90.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Metro Pictures, New York</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her work has calmed down since, as has, post-therapy, her life. She remains something of an enigma in the art world, both a product of it and a somewhat reluctant star within it.

It is, she says, more about \u201cgoofing around a lot\u201d than an extension of her art practice. \u201cSomeone showed me an app which people use to make themselves look better online,\u201d she says. \u201cI use it to make myself really not look better.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/aug/09/cindy-sherman-instagram-selfies-filtering-life\">How Cindy Sherman's Instagram selfies are changing the face of photography</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If one wanted to measure how deeply Cindy Sherman\u2019s art of disguise has seeped into the public consciousness, you need look no further than an episode of <a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/468/switcheroo\" title=\"\">the popular podcast</a><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/468/switcheroo\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://www.thisamericanlife.org/468/switcheroo\" title=\"\">This American Life</a></em>.

      "bodyText": "Perhaps the most intriguing exhibit in Cindy Sherman\u2019s forthcoming retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery is the first, Cindy Book, a family photo album she began making when she was just six years old. It comprises 26 snapshots pasted on pages torn out of a school exercise book and placed inside stapled-together plain covers that are now stained and discoloured with age. For all sorts of reasons, it is a good place to start. There is no artifice in the actual photographs. They trace ordinary moments in Sherman\u2019s early life from infancy to adolescence: cute baby pics, family gatherings, snaps of her as a child at the beach and portraits of her as a teenager standing gauchely alongside awkward young men. What is striking is the sense of an almost stereotypical all-American suburban childhood. As is always the case with Sherman, though, nothing is quite what it seems. In green ink, she has circled herself in each photo and underneath written \u201cThat\u2019s me,\u201d. That comma is fascinating, perhaps a child\u2019s grammatical error, yet already implying, as curator Paul Moorhouse notes in his catalogue essay, \u201can unfolding process\u201d. When Sherman rediscovered Cindy Book as a 21-year-old art student, the process unfolded some more, as she added extra photos to the album and, as she puts it, made \u201cthe handwriting seem to grow up along with the images\u201d. Does she consider the original handmade album the beginning of her long and singular art practice (\u201cThat\u2019s me, or is it?\u201d) or does it start in earnest with the later intervention? \u201cThe original book is interesting to me because it was more about my fascination with our family snapshots,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were kept in a shoebox and, as a child, I loved to pore over them looking for pictures of myself as a baby, but also to identify all these characters that existed before I was born. There was such a big age gap between my older siblings and myself, so I think now I was somehow finding myself in the family through the snapshots. When I came back to the album as a student, that was definitely the more knowing artist coming into play.\u201d Somewhere between those two creative impulses, one instinctive and psychologically revealing, the other conceptual and wilfully deceptive, may lie the enduring fascination of Sherman\u2019s art. For nigh on 50 years, on the strength of one enduringly brilliant idea \u2013 turning the camera on her transformed self in order to exaggerate and illuminate the archetypes that are all around us, so familiar as to go almost unnoticed \u2013 Sherman has been hiding in plain sight as one of the great artists of our time. In that time, she has redefined photographic portraiture, her approach being, as her friend the writer and editor Ingrid Sischy noted in 1991, more akin to that of a cinematic auteur. \u201cShe\u2019s the director, the producer, the set designer, the costume mistress, and the star as well... In her hands, images aren\u2019t straitjackets but vehicles to show the infinite possibilities of who she could be.\u201d As the NPG retrospective will show, hers is an art of shape-shifting and disguise, artifice and camouflage. It draws on high and low culture: European and Hollywood films, 1950s television sitcoms, art history, high society, fashion, forensic science, drag, pinups and pornography; the esoteric and the everyday, the glamorous and the grotesque. All her major series are here, from the still resonant Untitled Film Stills, which she began when she first moved to New York in the late 70s, through the controversial Centerfolds, the even more controversial Sex Pictures (surely the most grotesquely provocative images ever exhibited in the gallery), the acerbic Fashion pictures, the History Portraits, the Flappers and the Street Style Stars. Seeing her creative journey unfold, from her use of cheap wigs and secondhand clothes through her discovery of prosthetics and on to her current Instagram experiments in digital face manipulation, what really fascinates is the consistent cultural resonance of her work. \u201cSherman\u2019s target is the look of the modern world,\u201d notes Moorhouse, \u201cwith whose manufactured character she evidently has a love\u2013hate relationship.\u201d And, if her personas have often echoed the way in which our image-obsessed culture has elevated style and appearance, they have also of late become freighted with new meaning in the so-called post-truth age, as the idea of the blatantly fake has taken on more ominous meaning, becoming an acceptable part of our degraded political discourse. As an interviewee, Sherman is incredibly accommodating, but somehow elusive, upbeat but slightly detached. A friend once memorably described her as having \u201cthe banality of a great actress\u201d, which may be a clever way of keeping the world at bay, but one can see why she connected with the art-rocker David Byrne \u2013 they were an item for several years \u2013 who evinces a similar kind of not quite normal normalness. Before that, she was married for 15 years to video artist Michel Auder, who was addicted to heroin for most of the relationship. They split up in 1999. She described a subsequent short relationship with struggling film-maker Paul H-O as \u201creal fucked-up\u201d. She is currently contentedly single, sharing her Manhattan loft apartment and her house in the Hamptons with a macaw called Mister Frieda, which she has owned for nearly 28 years. \u201cHe\u2019s been the longest companion I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she said recently, \u201calthough it\u2019s like having a perpetual two-year-old.\u201d Sherman came of age when postmodern theory occupied a place in art discourse that it no longer does; perhaps this is why her work has endured much better than some of her peers: because of its implicit \u2013 and sometimes explicit \u2013 feminist politics. \u201cI\u2019m not personally articulate,\u201d she says when I mention this. \u201cI don\u2019t even like giving lectures, and I certainly couldn\u2019t debate with anyone, but I have strong personal stances. I couldn\u2019t be an advocate but, through my work, I can be outspoken. What\u2019s also important, though, is that the work is always ambiguous, that it lends itself to interpretation. I\u2019m not a message artist.\u201d That much was clear from the start. Likewise the love-hate relationship with her subject matter that Moorhouse identifies. Both, as with her fascination with dressing up, may have their roots in her childhood. Born in New Jersey in 1954 and raised in Long Island, she grew up in thrall to Hollywood B-movies and television sitcoms of the time, many of which portrayed suburban America as an idyll of domesticity, traditional family values and untrammelled aspiration. \u201cI remember, as a child, being drawn to shows like I Love Lucy,\u201d she recalls, \u201cbut, even then, realising the artifice in them, the goofy sentiment of all those perfect mums with the perfect homes and perfect men. Growing up in the actual suburbs made me look at what was being portrayed and realise that it was fake. So I was both attracted and repulsed by those films and shows. I think that paradox somehow found its way into the work.\u201d The young Cynthia Sherman\u2019s family dynamic was complex. Her father, an aircraft engineer, was 49 and her mother, a high-school teacher, 45 when she was born. She was the youngest of five children, all of whom were much older \u2013 19 years separated Cynthia from her eldest sibling. She first began dressing up as a young child, often in the sanctuary of her bedroom. Was it, I ask, a form of attention-seeking, maybe even a cry for help? \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve talked about in therapy in recent years,\u201d she says, matter of factly. \u201cI know that I wasn\u2019t dressing up to entertain my family. It was more about me thinking, maybe they\u2019ll like me better this way. I guess I felt I wasn\u2019t accepted somehow. My parents had thought they were done with raising children when I came along. I don\u2019t think I picked up on all that until I began talking about it to my therapist.\u201d In past interviews, Sherman has described her childhood as normal and happy, which is certainly the sense you get from the Cindy Book. However, in one interview, she described her father as \u201ca creep\u201d who \u201cwould criticise with hate\u201d and, in another, called him \u201ca bigot\u201d and \u201cracist\u201d. As an adolescent, she experienced family tragedy up close, when her brother Frank took his own life. He had moved back into the family home in his mid-20s and belatedly bonded with his younger sister, who was 15 and had just made the decision to apply to art school when it happened. His death inevitably casts a long shadow. In 2016, when the Observer\u2019s Tim Adams broached the subject, she burst into tears and spoke of her subsequent time at art college as a kind of therapy. In 1972, she began studying for an art degree at Buffalo State College, where she initially excelled at drawing and painting but, ironically, failing the compulsory photography course because of her lack of technical skills. When forced to repeat it, she came under the tutelage of Barbara Jo Revelle, the first person to make her aware of conceptualism. \u201cShe felt that to have an idea was what mattered,\u201d Sherman told the New Yorker in 2000, \u201cand right away that made so much more sense to me\u201d. At Buffalo State College, Sherman began going out with an older artist, Robert Longo, and it was in their shared apartment that she made the first picture of herself \u2013 \u201cstark naked, like a deer in the headlights\u201d \u2013 as a way to confront her own suburban prudishness. In 1974, while working as an assistant in the nonprofit gallery Hallwalls she set up with Longo and others, she began turning up to openings disguised as someone else in thrift-shop clothes and makeup, standing quietly and without explanation amid the art works. The pair moved to New York soon afterwards, living in a loft in Fulton Street in lower Manhattan in the shadow of the newly built World Trade Center, when rents were cheap and the now-gentrified neighbourhood was a ghost town after dark. \u201cI never felt scared walking home at 4am,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no one to rob, so there were no criminals.\u201d At first, she stayed in a lot, dressing up and taking pictures of herself. For a time, she worked as a receptionist in a downtown gallery, Artists Space, again sometimes turning up in disguise \u2013 once in a nurse\u2019s outfit, another time as a 1950s secretary. One day, she showed a small selection of her photographs to the gallery director, Helene Winer, who told her she was on to something. It was the beginning of what would become her breakthrough series, Untitled Film Stills, in which she posed as archetypal characters from American B-movies and European art house films: the femme fatale, the bored housewife, the city girl, the vamp. Despite their postmodern knowingness, those early images still fascinate. The generic female characters she inhabits \u2013 furtive film actresses, harassed looking housewives, prim librarians \u2013 are ambiguous creations, identifiable as archetypes of femininity but also marooned from their contexts, freeze-framed in some bigger, more mysterious narrative. They are photography as elaborate performance: cerebral, ironic, deadpan. As in all of the series that follow, Sherman is present in the images as photographer, art director and performer, but absent insofar as they tell us nothing about her in the way a traditional self-portrait might. Instead, they are pure persona. \u201cMy early work was more about creating still lifes in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cOver time, it\u2019s become more about portraiture, but it\u2019s never been about self-portraiture because I don\u2019t feel like it is revealing anything of myself. It\u2019s about obscuring my identity, erasing or obliterating myself. It\u2019s not fantasy or pretending or narcissism. It\u2019s not about me.\u201d Alongside Jeff Wall, whose elaborately staged scenarios echoed traditional documentary photography while simultaneously subverting its style and its supposed truthfulness, Sherman made photography into a conceptual art form by foregrounding its deceptiveness (\u201cI know the camera always lies,\u201d she once said). Though not much commented upon, there is an element of play, as well as playacting, in all she does. \u201cOh yes. It\u2019s fun,\u201d she says, cheerily. \u201cIt\u2019s literally playing in my studio. That\u2019s why I like to work alone, because I can be less inhibited. I often don\u2019t know what I want until the end. It\u2019s very liberating.\u201d Can she remember the initial thrill of finding her own style, her language? \u201cInitially, it was just me retreating into my room and playing with makeup for fun. It was Longo who told me I should document my transformation from my normal self, which was masculine and boyish, to this vamp. When I did that, people were immediately interested. That\u2019s when I could really say: this is my art.\u201d The transformation was not altogether straightforward, though, as she elaborates. \u201cI thought I had found my place as an artist, but the problem was that, back then, photography was not a medium that was condoned by the art world. I felt I really wasn\u2019t accepted in the art or the photography world because I wasn\u2019t either.\u201d When did that change? \u201cNot until the early 90s.\u201d Really? That late? \u201cOh yes,\u201d she says, still sounding slightly indignant. \u201cI remember, back in the early 80s, I was included in a group show at MoMA and certain collectors saying, \u2018I love your work, but I don\u2019t collect photography.\u2019\u201d She pauses and, then, laughing, adds: \u201cIn fact, someone said that to me just a few weeks ago in Venice during the Biennale. It still happens, but rarely.\u201d These days, though, it no longer rankles. In 2011, Sherman made headlines when one of her Centrefolds series, Untitled #96, sold at auction for $3.89m, making it the most expensive photograph ever at that time. (It has since been superseded by Andreas Gursky\u2019s Rhein II and Richard Prince\u2019s Spiritual America, but five of her other works feature in the top 20 most expensive photographs of all time.) \u201cI didn\u2019t start to feel super-successful,\u201d she says, \u201cuntil I did the paintings show.\u201d (She\u2019s referring to the History Portraits, which she completed in 1990, using prosthetics as well as wigs, makeup and period costumes, to recreate the style of old master artworks.) \u201cI think they sold,\u201d she adds, pointedly, \u201cbecause they looked like old paintings.\u201d That must have been satisfying, though. \u201cIn a way, yes, but their popularity made me feel very guilty. I went straight into the Sex Pictures afterwards.\u201d The Sex Pictures (1992), alongside an earlier series that has come to be known as her Disaster pictures (1986-89), represent two viscerally angry, but nevertheless complex, responses to her own success in an art market not immune to peddling bad art in the guise of provocation. The latter series is both intentionally tasteless and compositionally intriguing: rotten food, vomit and fake body parts all photographed up-close and large-scale so that, from a distance, they look like abstractions. Intriguingly, she was mostly absent from the meticulously constructed ugliness, appearing as a ghostly reflection, as if aghast at the horror of it all. For the Sex Pictures, she used prosthetic penises, vaginas, sex toys and distorted limbs ordered from a catalogue of medical dummies used in teaching. \u201cI had already been collecting fake tits and asses for years,\u201d she says breezily, \u201cbecause I thought that at some point I could do really explicit nudity, but not of myself.\u201d The work features all the motifs of hardcore pornography but rendered grotesquely unreal and all the more unsettling for that. It was in part a response to the culture wars of the late 1980s, when the National Endowment for the Arts came under intense pressure from the Christian right for funding \u201cinappropriate\u201d work by the likes of Robert Mapplethorpe and Andres Serrano. It was also a riposte to Jeff Koons\u2019s Made in Heaven series, which comprised pornographic photographs of the artist and his bride to be, porn star Ilona \u2018Cicciolina\u201d Staller. \u201cI found them so lame and tame and not shocking at all,\u201d she says. \u201cThey just made me kind of angry.\u201d The Sex Pictures leap out of the catalogue for the NPG show, their visceral power to shock and disturb undiminished by the years. Their elaborate unrealness somehow makes them more shocking than Koons\u2019s empty porn pastiche or even the most hardcore photograph by Mapplethorpe. I can\u2019t imagine they were fun to make, though. \u201cI guess in a different way, they were, because I also enjoy doing the really difficult things that people can\u2019t buy. It\u2019s a reaction against the commerce of the art world, because I do feel guilty about it.\u201d Her work has calmed down since, as has, post-therapy, her life. She remains something of an enigma in the art world, both a product of it and a somewhat reluctant star within it. Her extraordinary success, though somewhat belated, seems to have taken her by surprise and, one senses, precipitated a long period of adjustment. \u201cIt all happened to me much faster than it did for a lot of my friends, who weren\u2019t as successful,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was difficult for me, but it has passed. I have accepted it more now.\u201d Nevertheless, her status still rankles even some of those supposedly closest to her. \u201cThere are a couple of friends I only see once a year when I have a Christmas party,\u201d she says, \u201cOtherwise, I don\u2019t have anything to do with them because I can feel their resentment so strongly. Even one of my family members is that way.\u201d She is not, she says, much given to \u201cschmoozing at big, groovy openings\u201d, but is certainly a presence on social media, where her Instagram feed, featuring regular posts of her face bent out of shape via digital manipulation, has 255,000 followers. It is, she says, more about \u201cgoofing around a lot\u201d than an extension of her art practice. \u201cSomeone showed me an app which people use to make themselves look better online,\u201d she says. \u201cI use it to make myself really not look better.\u201d If one wanted to measure how deeply Cindy Sherman\u2019s art of disguise has seeped into the public consciousness, you need look no further than an episode of the popular podcast This American Life. In 2012, when MoMA in New York hosted a retrospective of her work, Ira Glass, the podcast host, recalled an encounter in which a woman \u2013 upper middle class, aged 55-60, wearing wire-rimmed spectacles \u2013 had approached him and his friend in the gallery claiming to be Cindy Sherman. She told them that she came to the exhibition every day in disguise to see how people reacted to the work. When they quizzed her, studying her face for clues, she became uncomfortable, ending the conversation abruptly by saying that she was not in fact Cindy Sherman. They, of course, interpreted this as a typically Cindy Sherman thing to do. \u201cIt made her very credibly Cindy Sherman,\u201d Glass concluded. \u201cBut, eEven if it was not her, it was even better!, When the podcast presenters asked for other evidence of \u201clistener sightings\u201d of Cindy Sherman at MoMA, they received three responses, none of them matching the woman they had encountered. \u201cI knew it was her was when she walked by me after making eye contact for the third time,\u201d one listener wrote. \u201cI saw her eyes and they were the same as the eyes in her work. She looked to be 300lbs in her fat suit...\u201d Even more intrigued, Glass eventually managed to contact Sherman on the telephone. When told about the listener sightings at MoMA, she sounded fascinated, but replied that none of them was her. But, in a way, of course, all of them were. Cindy Sherman is at the National Portrait Gallery, London WC2, 27 June-15 September",

      "body": "<p>The highly tailored home that Helen and Andrew Magowan have created for themselves is full of stories. This former draper\u2019s shop in a quiet street of Victorian terraced houses in west London offered the Magowans the chance to create a bespoke living space. But, more than this, as the history of the house began to reveal itself, the couple and their architect, Patrick Lewis, decided to embrace it and \u2013 quite literally \u2013 weave the narratives of its former occupants through the interiors.</p> <p>The project became a collaboration with a number of textile artists, who created specially designed ribbons that wind their way through the rooms and the levels of the building. One is devoted to a member of the Roberts family, who spent 30 years living here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"93cd747f1f4274c3b8182282eecf713b48a3bcee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93cd747f1f4274c3b8182282eecf713b48a3bcee/0_0_6708_8942/750.jpg\" alt=\"Chain reaction: some of the ribbons that run through the building, this one in the main bedroom.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chain reaction: some of the ribbons that run through the building, this one in the main bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cFrom the second that Patrick told us this had once been a draper\u2019s shop, it was almost inevitable that we would do something with textiles,\u201d says Helen, who used to work in the fashion industry and is now studying and designing textiles. \u201cWhen we met Patrick and started talking about the house it was clear from the start that he was interested in some of the same things as us and that the heritage of the house was going to be an important part of the project.\u201d</p> <p>The Magowans used to live in an apartment in west London\u2019s Baron\u2019s Court, but wanted more space, privacy and their own front door. They also wanted to shape their own interiors rather than buying a ready-made home. When they came across the former draper\u2019s shop it had been carved into two separate apartments by the previous owner. </p> <p>\u201cIt was quite eccentric and strange,\u201d says Andrew, a lawyer for an online fashion company. \u201cJust after we bought it, I went to get the keys and opened the front door and thought, \u2018What have we done?\u2019 There was dust everywhere and it looked such as mess. We just thought, \u2018Oh no, we own this now.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The discovery of an old shop sign on the front of the house, which had been covered up by a sheet of plywood, was the beginning of a more positive process of revealing the building\u2019s history. Patrick asked the Magowans many conventional questions about how they wanted to live in the house, but he also began to research in detail the lives of the Roberts family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"672609cfbc1ecbab3781ebdecde15d13bb4eadb9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/672609cfbc1ecbab3781ebdecde15d13bb4eadb9/0_362_8842_6263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Material world: the blue and white kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Material world: the blue and white kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe house had been divided up, so the interiors were very disconnected at first,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cOne of the really big issues for us was trying to connect all the spaces together again. We had the idea to commission textile ribbons as a way of adding both physical and metaphorical connections. They also have a sense of movement through time and space.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ae6348d2418e3716524ff16ace99e21f5e1b7d3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae6348d2418e3716524ff16ace99e21f5e1b7d3d/0_0_6215_8286/750.jpg\" alt=\"Making history: Helen and Andrew in the dining area.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Making history: Helen and Andrew in the dining area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The original shop front was retained, with the architect designing a fresh entrance hall that leads through to a lounge and a study on the ground floor, painted in a rich blue palette. Upwards, via the new staircase introduced by Patrick, the first floor is the heart of the house, with a spacious, open-plan living area populated with the fruits of the couple\u2019s search for characterful midcentury furniture. The semi-separate kitchen is also on the first floor, towards the rear, with units from <a href=\"https://www.plainenglishdesign.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Plain English</a> painted in a striking combination of blue and white.</p> <p>Moving towards the top of the house, Patrick designed a double-height master bedroom with a custom \u201csewing box\u201d to one side. Faced with crafted bands of larch and oak, the box hides the master bathroom and also forms the base of a mezzanine that holds Helen\u2019s textiles studio at the summit of the house.</p> <p>Helen and Patrick worked closely to create the brief for the four narrative ribbons that wind their way through the house, tying the levels together while representing the stories of four members of the Roberts family. They commissioned textiles artists <a href=\"https://deepapanchamia.com/about/\" title=\"\">Deepa Panchamia</a>, <a href=\"https://www.annaglover.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Anna Glover</a> and Jennifer Hollidge to create the ribbons, using a variety of techniques, including digital printing, weaving and hand embroidery. In this way, the house became a curatorial project, introducing fresh threads of visual dynamism, as well as layers of historical narrative.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s now a really successful home for us,\u201d says Helen. \u201cIt\u2019s a great space to live or for having friends over and we really enjoyed finding furniture that has a lived-in feel and some character, without feeling too precious or refined. But it\u2019s also intellectually engaging if you know that these stories are there and can follow the threads. There is this secret world, full of stories, which is waiting to be discovered. But, at the same time, you don\u2019t have to know any of that to just enjoy the house as it is.\u201d </p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.patricklewisarchitects.com/\" title=\"\">patricklewisarchitects.com</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "The highly tailored home that Helen and Andrew Magowan have created for themselves is full of stories. This former draper\u2019s shop in a quiet street of Victorian terraced houses in west London offered the Magowans the chance to create a bespoke living space. But, more than this, as the history of the house began to reveal itself, the couple and their architect, Patrick Lewis, decided to embrace it and \u2013 quite literally \u2013 weave the narratives of its former occupants through the interiors. The project became a collaboration with a number of textile artists, who created specially designed ribbons that wind their way through the rooms and the levels of the building. One is devoted to a member of the Roberts family, who spent 30 years living here in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \u201cFrom the second that Patrick told us this had once been a draper\u2019s shop, it was almost inevitable that we would do something with textiles,\u201d says Helen, who used to work in the fashion industry and is now studying and designing textiles. \u201cWhen we met Patrick and started talking about the house it was clear from the start that he was interested in some of the same things as us and that the heritage of the house was going to be an important part of the project.\u201d The Magowans used to live in an apartment in west London\u2019s Baron\u2019s Court, but wanted more space, privacy and their own front door. They also wanted to shape their own interiors rather than buying a ready-made home. When they came across the former draper\u2019s shop it had been carved into two separate apartments by the previous owner. \u201cIt was quite eccentric and strange,\u201d says Andrew, a lawyer for an online fashion company. \u201cJust after we bought it, I went to get the keys and opened the front door and thought, \u2018What have we done?\u2019 There was dust everywhere and it looked such as mess. We just thought, \u2018Oh no, we own this now.\u2019\u201d The discovery of an old shop sign on the front of the house, which had been covered up by a sheet of plywood, was the beginning of a more positive process of revealing the building\u2019s history. Patrick asked the Magowans many conventional questions about how they wanted to live in the house, but he also began to research in detail the lives of the Roberts family. \u201cThe house had been divided up, so the interiors were very disconnected at first,\u201d says Andrew. \u201cOne of the really big issues for us was trying to connect all the spaces together again. We had the idea to commission textile ribbons as a way of adding both physical and metaphorical connections. They also have a sense of movement through time and space.\u201d The original shop front was retained, with the architect designing a fresh entrance hall that leads through to a lounge and a study on the ground floor, painted in a rich blue palette. Upwards, via the new staircase introduced by Patrick, the first floor is the heart of the house, with a spacious, open-plan living area populated with the fruits of the couple\u2019s search for characterful midcentury furniture. The semi-separate kitchen is also on the first floor, towards the rear, with units from Plain English painted in a striking combination of blue and white. Moving towards the top of the house, Patrick designed a double-height master bedroom with a custom \u201csewing box\u201d to one side. Faced with crafted bands of larch and oak, the box hides the master bathroom and also forms the base of a mezzanine that holds Helen\u2019s textiles studio at the summit of the house. Helen and Patrick worked closely to create the brief for the four narrative ribbons that wind their way through the house, tying the levels together while representing the stories of four members of the Roberts family. They commissioned textiles artists Deepa Panchamia, Anna Glover and Jennifer Hollidge to create the ribbons, using a variety of techniques, including digital printing, weaving and hand embroidery. In this way, the house became a curatorial project, introducing fresh threads of visual dynamism, as well as layers of historical narrative. \u201cIt\u2019s now a really successful home for us,\u201d says Helen. \u201cIt\u2019s a great space to live or for having friends over and we really enjoyed finding furniture that has a lived-in feel and some character, without feeling too precious or refined. But it\u2019s also intellectually engaging if you know that these stories are there and can follow the threads. There is this secret world, full of stories, which is waiting to be discovered. But, at the same time, you don\u2019t have to know any of that to just enjoy the house as it is.\u201d patricklewisarchitects.com",

Trying to exercise through that wasn\u2019t particularly nice. \u201cBut the quicker you get it moving, the quicker you\u2019ll be back on your feet again. Then I\u2019d say from weeks eight and nine, it\u2019s really started to go quite nicely. [I\u2019ve] been able to do a lot of things I have not done for a really long time without pain. Playing golf and walking the dogs is fun and enjoyable now, whereas it was pretty uncomfortable for a couple of years.\u201d</p> <p>Murray\u2019s home life, after 15 years on the road, is centred on spending quality time with his wife, Kim, and their two young daughters. It sounds as if he is enjoying the change, although he admitted he may be hard to live with sometimes. \u201cWhen I can help out with the five o\u2019clock wake-ups, it\u2019s nice to have me around, but the rest of the time they\u2019d like me out of the house.\u201d</p> <p>He also wants to see more than the four walls of a hotel room and the journey to and from courts. \u201cIf I do get back to playing, something I\u2019d try to do a bit more of is spend more time out in the cities, seeing sights, exploring. We get to go to amazing places, some of the nicest cities in the world. Often we spend most of our time at the courts practising and in hotels, having room service. It\u2019s not what people might imagine it to be \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to do everything properly.\u201d</p> <p>Murray told Petchey there has been no shortage of support for him in the locker room. \u201cIt has been nice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Australia [after he lost in the first round and the organisers played a video on court of messages from the leading players] it was tough because I didn\u2019t know what the outcome of anything was going to be. The genuine feeling at that stage was that I might not be playing again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve always been at arm\u2019s length with a lot of the players. I am not massively close with loads of guys in the locker room. There\u2019s a few that I get on with really well. Who have I had messages from? I\u2019ve had a couple of messages from [Roger] Federer. [Stan] Wawrinka, he\u2019s messaged me a couple of times. Rafa [Nadal], once or twice \u2013 and a lot of the British players.</p> <p>\u201cIf the match I played in Australia [losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in five sets] was my last one, it would be an amazing way to finish as well. It was a great match, brilliant atmosphere. As I get older, especially because of what I have been through the last couple of years, I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s not about winning all the time. It\u2019s actually about giving your best effort. That day, I could not have given more than what I had.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile Johanna Konta has pulled out of next week\u2019s Nottingham Open after her run to the French Open semi-finals. \u201cAfter Paris my body is pretty exhausted from all the matches I have played,\u201d said the British No 1, who has reached the past two finals in Nottingham and last year was beaten by the new French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite events so I\u2019m disappointed not to be there.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andy Murray, who returns to tennis in the doubles at Queen\u2019s this month, has said he is relaxed about ever playing singles again. \u201cI thought during the whole injury troubles that tennis was the most important thing to me and getting back on court was going to make me happy,\u201d Murray said, reflecting on his slow but steady recovery from a hip operation in January. \u201cUltimately, once I got rid of the pain and I\u2019ve started to enjoy doing other things, fun things with my friends and my family, I\u2019m pretty relaxed about whether I get back on a court competing again. It would be nice but if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m OK with that as well.\u201d Talking in an interview for Amazon Prime with his first full-time coach, Mark Petchey, the triple-slam champion, who turned 32 last month, was frank about his circumstances. \u201cThe first six or seven weeks [of rehab] were pretty hard, uncomfortable,\u201d he said. Trying to exercise through that wasn\u2019t particularly nice. \u201cBut the quicker you get it moving, the quicker you\u2019ll be back on your feet again. Then I\u2019d say from weeks eight and nine, it\u2019s really started to go quite nicely. [I\u2019ve] been able to do a lot of things I have not done for a really long time without pain. Playing golf and walking the dogs is fun and enjoyable now, whereas it was pretty uncomfortable for a couple of years.\u201d Murray\u2019s home life, after 15 years on the road, is centred on spending quality time with his wife, Kim, and their two young daughters. It sounds as if he is enjoying the change, although he admitted he may be hard to live with sometimes. \u201cWhen I can help out with the five o\u2019clock wake-ups, it\u2019s nice to have me around, but the rest of the time they\u2019d like me out of the house.\u201d He also wants to see more than the four walls of a hotel room and the journey to and from courts. \u201cIf I do get back to playing, something I\u2019d try to do a bit more of is spend more time out in the cities, seeing sights, exploring. We get to go to amazing places, some of the nicest cities in the world. Often we spend most of our time at the courts practising and in hotels, having room service. It\u2019s not what people might imagine it to be \u2013 if you\u2019re trying to do everything properly.\u201d Murray told Petchey there has been no shortage of support for him in the locker room. \u201cIt has been nice,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Australia [after he lost in the first round and the organisers played a video on court of messages from the leading players] it was tough because I didn\u2019t know what the outcome of anything was going to be. The genuine feeling at that stage was that I might not be playing again. \u201cI\u2019ve always been at arm\u2019s length with a lot of the players. I am not massively close with loads of guys in the locker room. There\u2019s a few that I get on with really well. Who have I had messages from? I\u2019ve had a couple of messages from [Roger] Federer. [Stan] Wawrinka, he\u2019s messaged me a couple of times. Rafa [Nadal], once or twice \u2013 and a lot of the British players. \u201cIf the match I played in Australia [losing to Roberto Bautista Agut in five sets] was my last one, it would be an amazing way to finish as well. It was a great match, brilliant atmosphere. As I get older, especially because of what I have been through the last couple of years, I\u2019ve realised it\u2019s not about winning all the time. It\u2019s actually about giving your best effort. That day, I could not have given more than what I had.\u201d Meanwhile Johanna Konta has pulled out of next week\u2019s Nottingham Open after her run to the French Open semi-finals. \u201cAfter Paris my body is pretty exhausted from all the matches I have played,\u201d said the British No 1, who has reached the past two finals in Nottingham and last year was beaten by the new French Open champion, Ashleigh Barty. \u201cIt\u2019s one of my favourite events so I\u2019m disappointed not to be there.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Mitt Romney may not endorse Donald Trump for re-election in 2020, partly because the 2012 Republican nominee thinks political endorsements are not \u201cworth a thimble of spit\u201d. That said, the Utah senator remains happy to endorse his choice for president in 2016. Then, having called his party\u2019s nominee \u201ca phoney, a fraud\u201d, he voted for his wife, Ann. This week, Romney said: \u201cI still think she\u2019s doing a fine job.\u201d The former Massachusetts governor was elected to the Senate last year, after attempts at a rapprochement with Trump produced an unsuccessful bid to be named secretary of state that generated embarrassing public appearances. Trump endorsed Romney for Congress. Nonetheless the senator has emerged as a leading critic, if inconsistently and largely if not entirely regarding foreign policy. In January, Romney wrote a scathing column for the Washington Post in which he lamented Trump\u2019s behaviour, writing: \u201cWith the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent\u2019s shortfall has been most glaring.\u201d But he recently declined to join the Michigan representative Justin Amash in calling for Trump\u2019s impeachment from the Republican side of the aisle. Trump faces one declared challenger for the 2020 nomination, former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld. Last week Maryland\u2019s governor, Larry Hogan, who was courted by anti-Trump conservatives and openly considered a run, said he would not attempt to take Trump down. Romney\u2019s niece is chair of the Republican National Committee, which has faced criticism for supposedly seeking to block a primary challenge. As she runs a party firmly under Trump\u2019s sway, Ronna McDaniel has ceased using Romney as her middle name. Romney spoke to reporters on Friday at the E2 Summit, a gathering of politicians, donors and business figures in Park City, Utah. Romney hosts the event, which is chaired by former House speaker Paul Ryan, another who did not meet with noticeable success when attempting to oppose, contain or support the president. \u201cI don\u2019t think endorsements are worth a thimble of spit,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I stay out of the endorsements.\u201d He did not say who he thought would win the Democratic nomination, though he did say former vice-president Joe Biden would be a tougher challenger than his nearest rival in the polls, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders. He added that he thought \u201cthe attitude here has got to be the same as across the country, which is the president will surely be the Republican nominee and an incumbent in a growing economy is more likely to win than to lose. But it\u2019s not a sure thing.\u201d Speaking before Trump announced a deal with Mexico on immigration and the withdrawal of threatened tariffs, Romney said: \u201cPunishing Mexico in some way is, in my opinion, a very bad idea. It\u2019s also expensive for Americans.\u201d But he said he did support Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods, which critics have said will similarly hurt American consumers. \u201cPresident Trump was right to push back hard on China, and I support that effort,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much recognition in the United States about the long-term issues with China.

      "bodyText": "Simon Cambers\u2019s report: Right now time for the women\u2019s final. I\u2019ll be on that blog shortly, but before that I need a quick break. In the meantime Will Unwin will kick it off: Thiem speaks! \u201cIf someone reaches the final here it is always against Rafa. It was an amazing experience last year and he is favourite but I\u2019ll put everything into making it an aamzing experience out here again.\u201d So ends Djokovic\u2019s bid to hold all four major titles at the same time. That is Thiem\u2019s first fifth set ever at Roland Garros, remarkable considering he is now going to play his second final. Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 5-7 Thiem (*denotes server): An error from Djokovic opens the door at 0-15 but he continues his regular assaults on the net to follow-up and level. Two points later an inside-out forehand from Thiem pulls it back to 30-30. Six points later and it is still tied at deuce. Now it is Djokovic under pressure, he dumps a forehand into the net and Thiem has a match point! AND HE\u2019S DONE IT! Fifth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 5-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): What touch from Thiem! A forehand drop shot has Djokovic scrambling and sets up a hold to love. Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 5-5 Thiem (*denotes server): As we tick into fourth hour for the match Djokovic steadies himself to get out to a 30-0 lead but Thiem fights to get back to 30-30. The wind is proving problematic for both players on court... as is the net-cord. This time it goes in Djokovic\u2019s favour, sending a Thiem backhand out of play. A contested line call goes Djokovic\u2019s way and it is all square. Fifth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 4-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem hits a couple of strong serves to get himself to match point at 40-15 but a horrible slice backhand means he has to try again. Another loose shot and we are at deuce. Does anyone want to win this? Thiem blasts a forehand long and now Djokovic has a break point. Again, the world No 1 does nothing but put the ball back in play and watch his opponent make a mistake, this time it is a backhand into the net. Back on serve... Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 3-5 Thiem (*denotes server): What a turnaround since the rain delay for Djokovic but is he going to throw it away again? He dumps a backhand into the net at 30-30 and does the same on the forehand in the very next point. Incredible. Thiem is now serving for the match! Fifth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 3-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem looks in a hurry to finish this but that haste could cost him. Djokovic, by comparison, seems serene. At 30-30, Djokovic seizes control of the rally and puts his opponent on the back foot before finishing him off with a cool volley. Thiem saves that break point but Djokovic will not be denied as Thiem flicks an attempted lob long to put deciding set back on serve. Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 2-4 Thiem (*denotes server): We have play! Straight away there is drama as Djokovic stops play to contest a ball he thinks was out, the umpire disagrees but the Serb is able to save the break point and ultimately win the game. Great mental strength from Djokovic to remain calm there. An hour since they went off court the players are back out. They will have a five-minute warm-up then resume. Annoyingly, play had already started on the outside courts 10 or 15 minutes before. We are about ready to get back underway on Philippe Chatrier. The covers are off and play is imminent, or so we hope... A couple of interesting views have come in via email about Djokovic\u2019s behaviour. Thomas Traill writes: Perhaps it\u2019s partly a vicious circle, i.e. the further his popularity drops, the more he gets fed up? It\u2019s a sympathetic point but Andy Murray has been viewed as a bit of a moaner at various points in his career but has remained pretty popular. Going a little deeper, Abhijato Sensarma writes: I do not defend either person\u2019s actions, but the fact that Serena Williams was penalised repeatedly on that fateful day of the US Open final for the same kind of behaviour which Novak has shown throughout this match (and hasn\u2019t been docked points like her) shows us that different lines are drawn for men and women when it comes to penalising them for verbal abuse. I do not have enough proof to call this sexism, but when you\u2019re letting off a person of one gender for his venting of anger, you can\u2019t penalise another person of the other gender for doing the same! Double standards exist even at the most elite tournaments, as we\u2019ve seen throughout the course of this match. With more awareness being raised each day, however, hopefully the new generation of chair umpires treat everyone fairly going forward. This is pretty much the point Serena Williams has ever since and one I personally I agree with. Djokovic\u2019s behaviour was perhaps delivered in a more controlled manner but the content was not dissimilar. Play to resume not before 2pm BST, so about 20 minutes or so. The women\u2019s singles final will not start until the conclusion of the men\u2019s semi-final but the build-up has started with Will Unwin here: For a man who is apparently yearning for universal acclaim Djokovic is not exactly brilliant at reflecting that with his on court behaviour. Steve Zolno asks via email: Do you think there should be a penalty for repeated whining? Verbal abuse is a code violation but Djokovic\u2019s fourth set blast at the umpire apparently didn\u2019t quite cross the line. Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 1-4 Thiem (*denotes server): A must-hold for Djokovic but Thiem seems determined to make it difficult for him as he charges in to hit a winner to get to 15-15. At 30-30 a desperate Thiem lob befuddles Djokovic as a strong gust of wind first keeps the ball inside the baseline and then takes it away from him on the bounce. The break is snuffed out but then disaster. The rain arrives and, just like that, the players are rushing off court. Play will resume, whenever that is, at 40-40. Fifth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 1-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): A hold to love looks on the cards before Djokovic makes a superb get and a Thiem serves another double fault. The Austrian finally consolidates the break as Djokovic nets a regulation backhand at 40-30. Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 1-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem makes it five points in a row since facing a break point to go 0-30 up on Djokovic\u2019s serve. The Serb\u2019s drifts a backhand wide and Thiem has three chances to go ahead. He takes the second as Djokovic sees his backhand volley clip the net cord and bounce back on his own side. Fifth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 1-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem\u2019s hunting the lines again but at 30-30 he gets a punchy effort wrong and hands his rival an opening but a poor effort from Djokovic gets the world No 4 off the hook. Fifth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 1-1 Thiem (*denotes server): A stunning point goes Thiem\u2019s way to bring the game to 40-40. Thiem used the wind to aid a drop hot and bring in Djokovic before flicking it past him on the stretch. The Austrian then earns a break with the shot of the match: a cheeky drop shot, played tight to the net at an outrageous angle that wrong foots Djokovic, who was preparing to chase down the line. Ultimately there\u2019s no reward for Thiem as Djokovic digs in to hold. Fifth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): A routine hold for Thiem at the start of the decider will do his confidence some good. He noticeably fell off at the end of the last set. During the break the Austrian was trying to stay loose as Djokovc sat in his chair. We\u2019re over three hours for this match now. With this match going the distance the happiest man in Paris has to be Rafael Nadal. Andrew Benton agrees, he writes in: \u201cI can\u2019t see Djokovic or Thiem getting past Nadal in the final, he\u2019s on top form at the mo.\u201d Hard to disagree. Fourth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 7-5 Thiem (*denotes server): The southern end of Philippe Chatrier has been a death valley for servers in this set. Djokovic has to hold take us the distance and despite an errant drop shot at 15-0 up he does so with little difficulty. Fourth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 6-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Djokovic rages at a missed opportunity to go 0-30 up, lamenting weak effort on the approach that allows Thiem to save the point with a lob. However the pressure tells on Thiem, a wretched forehand gives Djokovic a break chance, with a double-fault ensuring the receiver does not even have to work to secure it. Fourth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 5-5 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem opens up with a thunderous backhand to steal an early march but two missed returns hands back advantage. That is poor from Thiem as he squanders two more points with loose backhands to offer Djokovic an easy hold. Fourth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 4-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Tentative would be the best way to describe Djokovic right now. A consolidating hold means the Serb is serving to stay in the match. Fourth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 4-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Djokovic slips on the first point of his service game as a slice return wrong-foots him. Thiem digs in and all of a sudden a break point appears, before a sloppy attempted drop shot from Djokovic gifts Thiem the game. The pendulum swings again. Fourth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 4-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): A stunning return from Djokovic will only serve to further dent Thiem\u2019s mindset as he slips to 0-15. The Austrian does well to recover and steadies himself to earn a hold. Fourth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 4-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Can anyone hold serve? Yes, comes the response. Despite three games of evidence to the contrary, Djokovic makes it appear easy. Thiem needs to regroup. Fourth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 3-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): After that slice of luck Thiem\u2019s form deserts him as a series of errors, including a double-fault, sees Djokovic break to love. Fourth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 2-2 Thiem (*denotes server): A brutal backhand from Thiem, deep in the receiving court, puts him up 0-30 on Djokovic\u2019s serve. The world No 1 finds the net two points later and Thiem has two shots at breaking straight back. Djokovic saves one and a loose slice from Thiem restores parity. What follows is a remarkable point, stout defence from Djokovic is met by deft touch from his opponent to earn a third break point and an outrageous net-cord sends a Thiem return looping deep over his rival for an unlikely winner. All square again. Fourth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 2-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): This time the net-cord goes against Thiem as a 22-shot rally ends with Djokovic getting a chance at an easy winner that he gladly takes. That set up a break point and loose backhand from Thiem gives Djokovic the first heavy blow of the fourth set. Fourth set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 1-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Djokovic is channelling that aggression into his play, earning a heavy-handed hold to love. Fourth set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem blocks out the swirling anger at the other end for a routine hold. \u201cWell done, well done man. You\u2019ve earned yourself a name,\u201d snipes Djokovic at the umpire during the turnaround at the break. That\u2019s a reference to the warning Djokovic got for taking too much time on his serve in the last game. Third set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-7 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem going all out to avoid a tie-break, aggressively looking for the lines and hitting some delightful winners. Djokovic is rattled by the umpire starting the service clock what the Serb perceives as a tad prematurely. Perhaps that was in his head as a straightforward error hands Thiem a set point. Djokovic saves that one and two more as the game drifts past 10 minutes. A magnificent low return proves my previous prediction wholly incorrect. Advantage Thiem! Third set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): Far easier for the Austrian this time. On this form a tie-break looks inevitable. Third set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 5-5 Thiem (*denotes server): A rogue attempted winner from Djokovic sails into the net to make it 15-15, but that is redeemed in the very next point by a trip to the net that surprises his opponent and clears an easy path to hold. Third set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 4-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem has a delightfully delicate slice but there are no rewards for style alone as Djokovic keeps plugging away. Facing another break point, Thiem gets a huge chunk of fortune as he twice fails to put away the point with an overhead only to see his drop shot clip the top of the net and drop in his favour. It\u2019s a gutsy hold for Thiem a few points later as Djokovic sends a routine backhand wide. Third set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 4-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem\u2019s groundstrokes are just not as clean as Djokovic\u2019s at the moment. The younger man is playing the more eye-catching shots but with less consistency. Thiem wins the point of the game by out-duelling Djokovic at the net to make it 30-30 all but it is in vain as the world No 1 holds to win his third game in a row. Third set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 3-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): There is a steely focus to Djokovic in the early stages here and a couple of errors from his opponent again provide an opportunity to break. A double fault and a long backhand from Thiem sets up 30-40 and another loose shot from the Austrian mean it\u2019s back on serve in the third. Third set: *Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 2-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Straightforward hold for Djokovic. Third set: Djokovic 2-6, 6-3, 1-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): As we resume, a wild forehand from Thiem spirals high into the air and opens the door for Djokovic and a couple of blows later the Serb has a break chance. Thiem shows some mettle to finally knock down his opponent, closing a 23-shot rally with a mighty forehand down the line to earn parity. After that it\u2019s all Thiem, winning the next two points in impressive style to back-up his break last night. Polite applause for Djokovic as he is introduced on Philippe Chatrier. It will be interesting to see how crowd reacts to the Serb after his slightly controversial early exit last night. Djokovic and Thiem are due on court in under 10 minutes. That breeze is a bit stiffer than perhaps first billed, poor Annabel Croft is struggling to keep her hair out of her face on Eurosport. Djokovic has at least decided to get out of his car this morning... For the organisers of the French Open the faster they can get the tournament in the history books and get planning for 2020 the better. A weather-worn two weeks at Roland Garros has exposed some unwanted flaws in scheduling and left tournament director Guy Forget open to some well-earned criticism. The latest farce sees Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem resume their semi-final battle on Philippe Chatrier at 11am BST - some three hours before Ashleigh Barty takes on Mark\u00e9ta Vondrou\u0161ov\u00e1 in the women\u2019s final - in a match that could well have been concluded on Friday evening. A premature decision to end play with the sun shining overhead left Thiem up 6-2, 3-6, 3-1, but also at least an hour of good conditions on the clock. The decision to sell separate tickets for the men\u2019s semi-finals has also backfired with refunds given to those who endured the on-off match-up last night. The good news is that despite a bit of breeze the weather in Paris is forecast to stay clear for today and we could be in for intriguing conclusion to the bonus match this morning. Djokovic, a break down, is on the verge of losing just his second set of the tournament in what is now effectively a three-set contest. Thiem, the most obvious heir apparent to Rafael Nadal on clay, hopes to secure a shot of avenging last year\u2019s defeat to the Spaniard and deny Djokovic a return to the French Open for the first time since 2016.",

Of course, in a very <em>Black Mirror</em> move, the episode\u2019s themes coincided with real-world events that happened just the day before it came out. On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-48523868\" title=\"\">a grim video</a> circulated of Cyrus being grabbed and kissed while out in a heaving, jostling crowd in Barcelona.

To promote Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, Cyrus has changed her Twitter handle to Ashley O, blurring the lines of her character and herself once more, just like the Disney days. The difference between what happened last week is that one is a horrible, depressing vision of the world; the other is an episode of <em>Black Mirror</em>.</p> <h2>Latex will so suit Robert Pattinson, the new Batman</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99cafd63ccb829c17aae5ae543b0b2a749cf71b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99cafd63ccb829c17aae5ae543b0b2a749cf71b5/0_142_2333_1399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Pattinson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Pattinson, the latest occupant of the Batcave.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Crossick/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like an indie band that had a few minor hits in the 90s and have discovered that, on the live circuit, the nostalgia pound is strong, Batman just keeps on coming back for more.

      "bodyText": "All hail the return of Black Mirror and its standalone dystopian techno-parables that are so able to predict the future that they elected a grotesque cartoonish hate-buffoon made famous by television and conjured up a prime ministerial scandal involving sexual activity with a pig. Its new, three-episode fifth season has VR gaming, social media addiction and a pop star/robo-puppy/voice assistant hybrid in its sights and, as ever, life imitates art, or vice versa, the pace of living being such that who really knows any more. In its final episode \u2013 Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too \u2013 Miley Cyrus plays a Miley Cyrus/Hannah Montana-esque pop star who is isolated in her ivory tower, deep in the misery of realising that fame and indeed pop itself are not all they were cracked up to be. It is a decent caper, a bit of a romp, but it is unlikely to be considered one of the season\u2019s great prescient moments. It looks at what is, rather than what will be. Its \u201cfame is toxic\u201d refrain is marred by its sniffiness towards pop music, much like A Star Is Born, with which it shares some of its DNA. I scrawled the Nine Inch Nails logo on my school bag with the best of them but I think Cyrus\u2019s version of Head Like a Hole could have benefited from some hardcore pop choreography. The episode just about works because of Cyrus. As Ashley O, and the voice of Ashley Too, she makes us both pity and root for the lonely, manipulated star whose life is very much not her own. Of course, in a very Black Mirror move, the episode\u2019s themes coincided with real-world events that happened just the day before it came out. On Tuesday, a grim video circulated of Cyrus being grabbed and kissed while out in a heaving, jostling crowd in Barcelona. She tweeted a response, along with a news clip asking: \u201cWas she groped?\u201d (people with eyes say: yes), pointing out that she can wear and do whatever she likes, but \u201cShe CAN\u2019T be grabbed without her consent\u201d. Cyrus followed her initial post with a screengrab of comments that criticised her clothes, her being \u201csexy\u201d, with the hashtag, #stillnotaskingforit. To promote Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too, Cyrus has changed her Twitter handle to Ashley O, blurring the lines of her character and herself once more, just like the Disney days. The difference between what happened last week is that one is a horrible, depressing vision of the world; the other is an episode of Black Mirror. Latex will so suit Robert Pattinson, the new Batman Like an indie band that had a few minor hits in the 90s and have discovered that, on the live circuit, the nostalgia pound is strong, Batman just keeps on coming back for more. When one round of Batmans has finished, there is barely time to say: \u201cDo you remember that one with the handclaps, that was good\u201d, before it grows a new head and carries on. This time, the much-derided gloom of Ben Affleck, a man whose public sadness vies only with that of Keanu Reeves, has been replaced with the new, edgier gloom of younger upstart Robert Pattinson. Pattinson is no stranger to a mega-franchise. He did, after all, shine bright like a diamond in the Twilight series, the final instalment of which remains one of the most avant garde and impressively batshit films of all time (the plot summary makes William Burroughs sound like Enid Blyton).

The casting process involved the actors being asked to don a previous Batsuit, as is, apparently, a Batman tradition. Sadly, the \u201cinsider\u201d who provided these details neglected to ask the crucial question: was it one of the nipply ones? Never mind his indie film credentials. If Pattinson got the big job by pulling off a massive latex suit with inbuilt pointy nipples built in to it (and let\u2019s just agree that he did, for me, despite a lack of any evidence that suggests it at all), then he deserves to fly and fly.

Here, consultations took place with Brown seated closest to the open door and an alarm close to hand. Shortly before she arrived, a nurse had been taken hostage by a prisoner. On the segregation wing, she saw patients through a hatch \u2013 sometimes to be met instead by a stream of abuse, saliva, or worse. \u201cOne of the challenging things was never knowing what might be waiting on the other side of the door.\u201d</p> <p>Brown functioned in a state of high alert, a constant charge of adrenalin. She might be called to an attempted suicide, a violent psychosis brought on by spice (smuggled drugs were by far the most frightening problem for her) or a horrific prisoner attack \u2013 she recalls being called to the showers where a naked man had been scalded with boiling sugar water.</p> <p>For the most part, Brown had no idea why the men were in prison, and she preferred it that way.

When a young man who spoke no English arrived in a wheelchair because he\u2019d jumped from a window fleeing police and his shattered legs had both been amputated, she cried. \u201cI cry a lot and it\u2019s embarrassing, but the day I lose my compassion is the day I stop working\u201d. When a violent prisoner from the segregation ward presented her with an intricate miniature racing car he\u2019d carved from a bar of soap \u2013 in thanks for \u201cbeing kind and not judging\u201d \u2013 she floated home on a high.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A woman told me that prison was the only place she\u2019d felt safe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Her final move was to HMP Bronzefield, the largest female prison in Europe. Brown calls it her \u201chappy place\u201d and, at 65, has no wish to leave. The women have been more open, seem to care more what she thinks and she describes her more regular patients as \u201calmost friends\u201d. \u201cBut the biggest difference from the men,\u201d she says, \u201cis how many women prisoners are victims themselves,\u201d says Brown. \u201cThey are victims of abuse, violence, rape. Their stories are heart breaking, overwhelming. I get lost for words when I think about them. At Bronzefield, you do learn what they\u2019re in for and it\u2019s usually shoplifting, theft, breach of licence. You do question whether prison is the right place for them \u2013 except for the fact that so many tell me it\u2019s a refuge. One of them, who has a violent partner, told me it\u2019s the first time she had felt safe in bed for seven years.\u201d</p> <p>Brown admits that the closer she has become to her patients, the less kindly disposed she has felt towards former friends. She swears more. She has less patience at social events and finds it harder than ever to tolerate social bragging. \u201cI don\u2019t really go to parties any more \u2013 no one invites me!\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband would say I\u2019ve become more assertive. I see people who have absolutely nothing. My eyes have been opened and it puts a different perspective on conversations that start with, \u2018So what are your boys doing now?\u2019 I hope this book can be a voice for the prisoners.\u201d</p> <p><em><strong>There are many</strong></em> unforgettable stories and lives in Brown\u2019s book. One is Andrea. She became a heroin addict after being attacked with a hammer, taken prisoner for two days and raped multiple times. She was 27 and had been on the way home from giving a talk on computer programming. Another is Trudy, sexually abused by her stepfather since the age of four. </p> <p>Brown doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s become of them. \u201cI\u2019ve got a folder stuffed with letters that prisoners wrote to me while they were there but, of course, I\u2019ll never see them again. If they\u2019re not back inside a few months later, I have to thank God and hope for the best.\u201d She pauses, then adds: \u201cThat\u2019s the worst part of prison medicine for me.

      "body": "<p>It all started with a mouse. Catherine Conway was unpacking all her food from the supermarket into glass jars to prevent it being eaten by a mouse that had taken up residence in her home when she had an idea. \u201cI remember very distinctly, one day, having all this packaging in my hands, thinking: why I can\u2019t I just go to a shop and refill everything in jars?\u201d It was 2005, and Conway, a charity worker, had been learning about the businesses that are set up to create social and environmental good. \u201cI was in my late 20s. I didn\u2019t have kids and I didn\u2019t have a mortgage. And in my professional life, I was looking for something interesting to do.\u201d</p> <p>She decided to set up a market stall in central London selling unpackaged dry goods \u2013 everything from Ecover cleaning products and cereal to nuts, dried fruit and rice \u2013 which people could only buy if they brought their own containers. \u201cIt was popular with a small amount of people right from the start: early adopters who, like me, wanted a solution. People who knew packaging was a problem, and didn\u2019t want it in their homes.\u201d</p> <p>Fast forward 14 years and last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/04/waitrose-launches-packaging-free-trial\" title=\"\">Waitrose launched a packaging-free trial</a>, allowing customers at a store in Oxford to purchase a wide range of the goods on sale in their own refillable containers. And it was Conway, 42, to whom Waitrose turned for help with creating the concept for the store and setting up the trial. She now runs a retail consultancy called <a href=\"https://www.beunpackaged.com/\" title=\"\">Unpackaged</a> and initially attracted the attention of Waitrose and other supermarkets after she created a packaging-free space within one branch of the retailer <a href=\"https://www.planetorganic.com\" title=\"\">Planet Organic. </a></p> <p>\u201cWe were trying all these different ways of encouraging people to move over to refillable containers,\u201d she says. Success did not come immediately. For years, she had been told by retail experts that the concept would never work in a supermarket, and there were times, Conway admits, when she thought about giving up. \u201cIt was only when public consciousness about the issue changed that people really started switching over.\u201d</p> <p>That moment came in December 2017, after the now-famous plastic pollution episode of <em>Blue Planet II</em> aired on television. Overnight, Conway found herself riding a huge tidal wave of public antipathy towards plastic packaging. \u201cWhen <em>Blue Planet</em> came out, it just totally shifted the dial on every aspect of packaging.\u201d</p> <p>Disturbed by the images they saw of sealife tangled in plastic waste, some viewers realised they needed to change their habits right away, she says. \u201cThat programme flipped the light switch. When wonderful Mr Attenborough spoke to people, it didn\u2019t sound like he was preaching. He was just presenting a fact to people: this is a real problem we have to deal with, and there is no other option but to deal with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5eee1e95e6dac604fc26b59e7aa351ea71ba2f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5eee1e95e6dac604fc26b59e7aa351ea71ba2f8/0_140_3744_4678/800.jpg\" alt=\"Campaigner Catherine Conway from Unpackaged.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Campaigner Catherine Conway from Unpackaged.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suddenly, she says, finding new ways to reduce your plastic packaging waste \u2013 from reusable coffee cups to paper straws \u2013 became fashionable and cool. People who had previously been too embarrassed to take their containers to Planet Organic started to do so. Within a month purchases of unpackaged goods in the store had increased by 40%. By Easter, Planet Organic had expanded the Unpackaged concept into three more of its shops, and late in the summer Waitrose, too, came on board.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very open door I was pushing,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were ready for it.

      "bodyText": "It all started with a mouse. Catherine Conway was unpacking all her food from the supermarket into glass jars to prevent it being eaten by a mouse that had taken up residence in her home when she had an idea. \u201cI remember very distinctly, one day, having all this packaging in my hands, thinking: why I can\u2019t I just go to a shop and refill everything in jars?\u201d It was 2005, and Conway, a charity worker, had been learning about the businesses that are set up to create social and environmental good. \u201cI was in my late 20s. I didn\u2019t have kids and I didn\u2019t have a mortgage. And in my professional life, I was looking for something interesting to do.\u201d She decided to set up a market stall in central London selling unpackaged dry goods \u2013 everything from Ecover cleaning products and cereal to nuts, dried fruit and rice \u2013 which people could only buy if they brought their own containers. \u201cIt was popular with a small amount of people right from the start: early adopters who, like me, wanted a solution. People who knew packaging was a problem, and didn\u2019t want it in their homes.\u201d Fast forward 14 years and last week Waitrose launched a packaging-free trial, allowing customers at a store in Oxford to purchase a wide range of the goods on sale in their own refillable containers. And it was Conway, 42, to whom Waitrose turned for help with creating the concept for the store and setting up the trial. She now runs a retail consultancy called Unpackaged and initially attracted the attention of Waitrose and other supermarkets after she created a packaging-free space within one branch of the retailer Planet Organic. \u201cWe were trying all these different ways of encouraging people to move over to refillable containers,\u201d she says. Success did not come immediately. For years, she had been told by retail experts that the concept would never work in a supermarket, and there were times, Conway admits, when she thought about giving up. \u201cIt was only when public consciousness about the issue changed that people really started switching over.\u201d That moment came in December 2017, after the now-famous plastic pollution episode of Blue Planet II aired on television. Overnight, Conway found herself riding a huge tidal wave of public antipathy towards plastic packaging. \u201cWhen Blue Planet came out, it just totally shifted the dial on every aspect of packaging.\u201d Disturbed by the images they saw of sealife tangled in plastic waste, some viewers realised they needed to change their habits right away, she says. \u201cThat programme flipped the light switch. When wonderful Mr Attenborough spoke to people, it didn\u2019t sound like he was preaching. He was just presenting a fact to people: this is a real problem we have to deal with, and there is no other option but to deal with it.\u201d Suddenly, she says, finding new ways to reduce your plastic packaging waste \u2013 from reusable coffee cups to paper straws \u2013 became fashionable and cool. People who had previously been too embarrassed to take their containers to Planet Organic started to do so. Within a month purchases of unpackaged goods in the store had increased by 40%. By Easter, Planet Organic had expanded the Unpackaged concept into three more of its shops, and late in the summer Waitrose, too, came on board. \u201cIt was a very open door I was pushing,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were ready for it. They were like: morally, we know this is the right thing to do. We just have to build a business case for it.\u201d The supermarket\u2019s 11-week experiment will not only test the concept of a unpackaged shop floor, but also the popularity of different refillable goods stations. From the moment they step in the door, customers will be flooded with environmental messages encouraging them to reduce their packaging waste and offering 10% discounts to those who bring their own containers to fill. For Conway, who advised Waitrose on everything from supply chain logistics and customer refill processes to marketing and staff training, the past week has been a dream come true. \u201cThe best thing, over the past few days, has been the willingness of people to say it won\u2019t be a problem to bring their containers in, and that they\u2019ve realised we have to do things differently. \u201d By contrast, when she first started trying to sell goods via refillable containers, many potential customers would say: what\u2019s the problem with packaging? \u201cNow, there\u2019s a consciousness that wasn\u2019t there before. And people are being very vocal about wanting change.\u201d Conway is currently in talks with \u201ctwo or three\u201d other major supermarkets and thinks that in six to 12 months all of them will be running unpackaged trials. There is \u201cmassive pressure\u201d on supermarkets to change their approach to packaging right now, she says. \u201cStaff are on the receiving end of a lot of abuse from customers about the frustrations of not being about to shop without plastic.\u201d Campaigning organisations such as Greenpeace are also attempting to hold them to account with league tables ranking the supermarkets\u2019 plastic policies. Under a new waste strategy unveiled by the government in December 2018 supermarkets and other retailers could be charged penalties for allowing difficult-to-recycle plastic to be bought by their customers, and lower fees for packaging that is easy to reuse or recycle. \u201cI hope that the work we\u2019re doing at Waitrose will show the other supermarkets that now is the time to be bold,\u201d says Conway. Ultimately, though, she wants to see a systemic change whereby, for example, brands offer their products in reusable containers that customers can return to the system, or supermarkets set up schemes which re-circulate used containers to other customers after a home delivery. \u201cI think we\u2019ll start to see the introduction of those systems in three to five years,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>Before standing down in 2007, John Browne was CEO of BP for 12 years. In 2015, he returned to the global oil business as executive chairman of L1 Energy. Since leaving BP, he has written five books; in the latest, he argues that engineers will save humanity from the threats such as disease, artificial intelligence and global warming.</p> <p><strong>You say that civilisation is founded on engineering innovation and technology. Do you equate human progress with machines?</strong> <br>Absolutely not. It is the combination of the machines, the engineering and humans that makes progress. Without engineering, there will not be progress, but machines without humans will go nowhere.</p> <p><strong>Do you understand the widespread public fear of unfettered technologies? </strong><br>Yes. Some engineering advances are not good for humans until they are confined in the right way.Some have really bad, unintended consequences. There are plenty I fear. The uncontrolled use of fissile material to make bombs is terrifying, so too [the release of] pathogens. There are problems with poisonous gases used by dictators, materials getting into the hands of rogue states.</p> <p><strong>Modern technology has given immense wealth and power to the very few and has allowed global surveillance and the erosion of privacy. Is that acceptable? </strong><br>These are worrying. But they lead back to the control of the technology and the question of the expression of values. So, surveillance and face recognition are something heavily controlled in the west. In China, they are not. Stanford University has developed a technology that can recognise, to a probability of 80%, gay people from straight. This is not a good thing to have. I say that as a gay man. I find it objectionable, too, that in China facial recognition technology is used to identify certain ethnic peoples and keep them under control. That is wrong.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The thing with technology is to\u00a0overcome the legacy of\u00a0the past. People have a vested\u00a0interest in\u00a0keeping it\u00a0going</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There will be aberrations, but [facial recognition] has been very beneficial across the world, whether it is for law enforcement, the convenience of people to pay, or to get in and out of buildings. But there are other things which have gone wrong unintenionally, or are in hands of wrong people.</p> <p><strong>Will engineering get us out of the problems we face? </strong><br>I am optimistic. Engineering is the application of discovery into life. It has done extraordinary things for the world. It has made it more peaceful, less violent, safer, cleaner. People live longer, they are better educated, there\u2019s less poverty. All these things have been brought about by engineering. Engineers have saved more lives than physicians; they have created clean water. In my lifetime, the world population has tripled and people are healthier and better off than they used to be when the world was one third its size.</p> <p><strong>But has technology not also made the world less secure? You are chair of the UK board of Chinese company Huawei</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> world leader in 5G technology. Will 5G technology undermine British or American security? </strong><br>It depends on your level of risk. The UK government has, apparently, said you can divide the system into high- and low-risk areas. If you keep certain technologies low risk they are happy with that, whereas others will say take no risk.</p> <p>The problem started with the break-up of the Bell Labs, which did the early research on telecoms. The pieces were sold off and we have ended up with the US not having a commercial approach to 5G. It\u2019s in the hands of only Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei. It\u2019s not an easy position for the world to be in and [it remains] to be seen if there\u2019s a way out of it. President Trump wound Huawei into a trade war, so is it part of a trade war or a security war? It\u2019s very difficult to resolve.</p> <p>The big thing with technologies is to overcome the legacy of the past. Many people have vested interests in keeping the past going because they make money with it.</p> <p><strong>Is not oil a legacy of the past? </strong><br>Not as old as coal, which is still a big part of the energy mix.</p> <p><strong>But you have spent a lifetime working with fossil fuels that have led to the climate crisis</strong><strong>. </strong><br>\u2026 and trying to change.</p> <p><strong>Have you succeeded? </strong><br>I\u2019ve been a little bit successful. I wish I had been much more successful. Because 22 years ago I made a very clear statement, to say the oil and gas industry was part of the problem, so it had better start working out how to solve it.</p> <p><strong>What would you say to Greta Thunb</strong><strong>erg</strong><strong>?</strong><strong> </strong><br>I would say that I have been at this for longer than you\u2019ve been on the planet and that [decarbonisation] will take time. And so my proposal is this: remember that energy is a very big system and there is not one solution. We can\u2019t have one magic bullet that will make the solution work for us. We need to take all the things people are doing [to reduce emissions] because it will be very difficult to persuade them to change. China is opening up brand new coal mines to feed India. What happens in the UK is actually not very important. It\u2019s what happens in places like China, Indonesia and India that will really count. Because we will need coal, oil and gas, we need to do everything we can to decarbonise the emissions. This is critical for the future.</p> <p><strong>You know the problems of climate change but you are now chair of the oil and gas investment company L1 Energy </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> still in the oil business</strong><strong>. </strong><br>Gas and oil. I created a company that is 70% natural gas and 30% oil. Gas has less carbon, it is much more environmentally friendly and has lots of different uses. That is much more modern than the other way round.</p> <p><strong>How are you working to reduce emissions? </strong><br>When I was with BP, I laid out a plan.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The planet will look after itself. What we are doing is adjusting its path. We will go.\u00a0It will come back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>But BP is producing more oil now than it was</strong><strong>\u2026 </strong><br>And I have been away a little while. Then I set up the world\u2019s largest renewable energy fund, $10bn of investment to prove to people you could make money from doing this. It\u2019s going to take us a long time to take oil and coal out of the energy system and even longer for natural gas. We have the tools to take a lot of the carbon out of hydrocarbons; what we don\u2019t have is the right cost. The more you do of something, normally, the cheaper it gets, with the exception of nuclear power [where] the more you make, the more expensive it becomes. That can be overcome with standardisation.</p> <p>Governments have to take the first risk [to reduce emissions] which is very high and industry will take the second risk, which is getting lower and lower. That\u2019s what happened with solar energy, which is an important but small part of the energy system.</p> <p><strong>But you are arguing in the book for fracking. You were chair of fracking company Cuadrilla</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> Does that make sense? </strong><br>No, fracking in the UK doesn\u2019t make much sense. I think it was a test to see if it worked. We probably don\u2019t need to do it.</p> <p><strong>Can we reduce emissions fast enough to avoid the frightening scenarios that are forecast</strong><strong>? </strong><br>If we get on with it now, we stand a chance. If we don\u2019t start now, the chances get lower and lower. I said 22 years ago that we should start then. We have done something but not enough.</p> <p><strong>Is the quest of humanity that we move to another planet? </strong><br>Who knows? James Lovelock changed my views. He reminds me that we\u2019re not trying to save this planet, but simply the humans on this planet. The planet will look after itself. It will have its course of life. What we are doing is adjusting its path. We will go. It will come back.</p> <p><strong>Does that justify wrecking it? </strong><br>Absolutely not. It just puts it in perspective that we have to do something to keep it ready for human beings. Because if we don\u2019t do things, we are simply consigning a portion, if not all, of humanity, to its death. That is wrong.</p> <p><strong>Are you saying that the planet is for humanity? Surely we have a responsibility for the rest of life? </strong><br>That is what I am saying. We are stewards because humanity must live on this planet. Humans are designed to live in an atmosphere with a certain amount of oxygen. If we go elsewhere, we are not well tuned to that. We\u2019ve got to figure out how to create a built-in environment to protect us.

That\u2019s what happened with solar energy, which is an important but small part of the energy system. But you are arguing in the book for fracking. You were chair of fracking company Cuadrilla. Does that make sense? No, fracking in the UK doesn\u2019t make much sense. I think it was a test to see if it worked. We probably don\u2019t need to do it. Can we reduce emissions fast enough to avoid the frightening scenarios that are forecast? If we get on with it now, we stand a chance. If we don\u2019t start now, the chances get lower and lower. I said 22 years ago that we should start then. We have done something but not enough. Is the quest of humanity that we move to another planet? Who knows? James Lovelock changed my views. He reminds me that we\u2019re not trying to save this planet, but simply the humans on this planet. The planet will look after itself. It will have its course of life. What we are doing is adjusting its path. We will go. It will come back. Does that justify wrecking it? Absolutely not. It just puts it in perspective that we have to do something to keep it ready for human beings. Because if we don\u2019t do things, we are simply consigning a portion, if not all, of humanity, to its death. That is wrong. Are you saying that the planet is for humanity? Surely we have a responsibility for the rest of life? That is what I am saying. We are stewards because humanity must live on this planet. Humans are designed to live in an atmosphere with a certain amount of oxygen. If we go elsewhere, we are not well tuned to that. We\u2019ve got to figure out how to create a built-in environment to protect us.

I broke the other leg, I\u2019ve broken both arms but yeah ... it was a straightforward break, a clean break, but it had to be realigned, there was a bit of work had to go into it.\u201d With his 40th birthday on the horizon, it is no surprise that Geraghty\u2019s body takes a bit longer to repair itself than it might have done a couple of decades ago. \u201cI would have denied that for years. But our now four-year-old son broke his leg off the trampoline two years ago and he took the exact same fracture as I\u2019d done the year before that. He was running round in the cast 12 days later. I wasn\u2019t running round in the cast 12 weeks later. As much as you want to deny it, the body slows down, I suppose. \u201cI saw the surgeon last week and he\u2019s very happy with it. I\u2019ll see him again in a couple of weeks. It\u2019s progressing well. I was originally hoping to make it back for Galway and that\u2019s still a possibility,\u201d he says, alluding to the week-long meeting that starts on 29 July. \u201cI haven\u2019t pressed him for an answer about timing. You can only really know two weeks before.\u201d In the meantime, he keeps himself busy by attending to the three children and 10 horses that share a home with him. For most of his career, Geraghty has made an enjoyable sideline out of buying and selling young horses, the Gold Cup winner Bobs Worth being the most notable example, and at least he has time to put into that this summer. \u201cThat\u2019s always something I\u2019ve been into, it\u2019s a good distraction. And I\u2019ve some nice ones to look forward to.\u201d With his fellow injured jockey Mark Enright, who has a fractured shoulder, Geraghty recently loaded some ponies into a trailer and took them to his child\u2019s play school, where they gave a group of youngsters their first chance to sit in a saddle. Weren\u2019t the poor kids scared by the sight of two battered old jump jockeys? He laughs and acknowledges that the pair of them may not, at that point, have been looking their best. \u201cThat was one of my initial worries about getting the frame, this\u2019ll be desperate for our own kids to have to look at this. But kids adjust and within two days it\u2019s become second nature.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Madonna is in her fourth decade of what we now somewhat suspiciously call appropriation, a pick-and-mix skill set that has previously laid the singer open to accusations of unoriginality or, worse, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/06/madonna-cultural-appropriation-cliche-iggy-azalea\" title=\"\">cultural hijacking</a>.</p> <p>But when the patented Ciccone filtration system gets it right, the process is just shy of alchemy. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s__rX_WL100\" title=\"\">Sexualised Catholicism</a>, at the dawn of MTV, was Madonna\u2019s first stroke of kismet. The last time Madonna was indisputably on point, she had hooked up with French producer Mirwais for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdz2oW0NMFk\" title=\"\"><em>Music</em> (2000)</a> and the sensuous possibilities of club culture. Her latterday output has stuttered somewhat, but for <em>Madame X</em> the stars have aligned with Madonna\u2019s Pinterest mood board once again. There are hot climates and a piratical eye-patch; shape-shifting to the sounds of the Portuguese diaspora, trap-pop and reggeaton.</p> <p>It helps, of course, that she self-quotes as much as she soaks up. Is Latin pop in vogue? Don\u2019t mind if Madonna seizes upon it. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAxNaLAR2to\" title=\"\">Medell\u00edn</a>, the first track from Madonna\u2019s 14th studio album, arrived like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpzdgmqIHOQ\" title=\"\">La Isla Bonita</a> on steroids: with Madonna in a lather of faith and lust, exercising her long-held fascination with all things Latinate and in sync with a pop mood attuned to the other Americas. A further hook-up with Colombian star Maluma lurks further down this generous tracklisting: Bitch, I\u2019m Loca flirts with reggaeton and Maluma himself, who plays a delivery man instructed by Madonna to \u201cput it inside\u201d. (Note the title: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hPMmzKs62w\" title=\"\">Bitch, I\u2019m Madonna</a>, remixed; throughout the album, you\u2019ll find Madonna saying a \u201clittle prayer\u201d as she did on Like A Prayer (1989), or on her knees \u201clike a virgin\u201d.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is an album whose most memorable songs are definitely its strangest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Colombia is a red herring, however. The songs that became <em>Madame X</em> actually came together during Madonna\u2019s two years in Portugal, where she decamped in 2017 when her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/31/madonna-moves-to-lisbon-as-son-joins-football-youth-academy\" title=\"\">son David enrolled in Benfica\u2019s football academy</a>. Madonna absorbed the local sounds with more of a mature, simpatico rather than asset-stripping eye.</p> <p>One lively Portuguese-diaspora tune, Faz Gostoso, makes a pitstop in Brazil, featuring <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiZ4c_hElf4\" title=\"\">Brazilian singer Anitta</a>. Most \u201cworld\u201d of all, however, are the sounds of batuque on a track called Batuka, a ceremonial good-time music of the Cabo Verde islands.

      "bodyText": "Madonna is in her fourth decade of what we now somewhat suspiciously call appropriation, a pick-and-mix skill set that has previously laid the singer open to accusations of unoriginality or, worse, cultural hijacking. But when the patented Ciccone filtration system gets it right, the process is just shy of alchemy. Sexualised Catholicism, at the dawn of MTV, was Madonna\u2019s first stroke of kismet. The last time Madonna was indisputably on point, she had hooked up with French producer Mirwais for Music (2000) and the sensuous possibilities of club culture. Her latterday output has stuttered somewhat, but for Madame X the stars have aligned with Madonna\u2019s Pinterest mood board once again. There are hot climates and a piratical eye-patch; shape-shifting to the sounds of the Portuguese diaspora, trap-pop and reggeaton. It helps, of course, that she self-quotes as much as she soaks up. Is Latin pop in vogue? Don\u2019t mind if Madonna seizes upon it. Medell\u00edn, the first track from Madonna\u2019s 14th studio album, arrived like La Isla Bonita on steroids: with Madonna in a lather of faith and lust, exercising her long-held fascination with all things Latinate and in sync with a pop mood attuned to the other Americas. A further hook-up with Colombian star Maluma lurks further down this generous tracklisting: Bitch, I\u2019m Loca flirts with reggaeton and Maluma himself, who plays a delivery man instructed by Madonna to \u201cput it inside\u201d. (Note the title: Bitch, I\u2019m Madonna, remixed; throughout the album, you\u2019ll find Madonna saying a \u201clittle prayer\u201d as she did on Like A Prayer (1989), or on her knees \u201clike a virgin\u201d.) Colombia is a red herring, however. The songs that became Madame X actually came together during Madonna\u2019s two years in Portugal, where she decamped in 2017 when her son David enrolled in Benfica\u2019s football academy. Madonna absorbed the local sounds with more of a mature, simpatico rather than asset-stripping eye. One lively Portuguese-diaspora tune, Faz Gostoso, makes a pitstop in Brazil, featuring Brazilian singer Anitta. Most \u201cworld\u201d of all, however, are the sounds of batuque on a track called Batuka, a ceremonial good-time music of the Cabo Verde islands. Batuka finds Portugal\u2019s Orquestra de Batukadeiras \u2013 women from Cabo Verde \u2013 helping out on a spiritual call-and-response track about overcoming adversity. There\u2019s a cute video on their Facebook page of Madonna drumming. Add to this a Diplo reggae production, Future, on which Madonna plays at being Santigold, and the hot-climate half of this album adds up to considerably more than the sum of its parts: a polyglot party that feels spontaneous, an internationalism that feels earned, not tokenistic. Naturally, this Madonna album has to respond to other major trends in US pop. Her selection of guests has an eye on hip-hop heat levels, rather than actual chemistry, calling on Quavo from Migos on Future, and Swae Lee from Rae Sremmurd on Crave. Their performances aren\u2019t quite as game as Maluma\u2019s. To say that the former sounds like a track that might have been done by Ariana Grande isn\u2019t a negative, though: here, Madonna pulls off contemporary R&amp;B-leaning pop with no obvious missteps. The meat of the album, however, lies elsewhere. Hidden away in the lyrics to Batuka are topical allusions: \u201cGet that old man/ Put him in a jail.\u201d Quite apart from the many Spanish and Portuguese passages, Madame X is littered with whispered, rapped or digitally cloaked lyrics. It is a political offering \u2013 the Eurovision palaver, where Madonna hamfistedly tried to engineer peace in the Middle East, was a foreshadowing \u2013 but one in which Madonna\u2019s meanings often perform a kind of seven-veil dance. Easiest to understand is Killers Who Are Partying, a 21st-century digital fado on which Madonna allies herself with the dispossessed and marginalised: virtue signalling, with trap beats on. It\u2019s sanctimonious, coming from a first-world millionaire, but she sings it like she believes it. Often, she obfuscates, but just intriguingly enough. A snippet of Florida school-shooting survivor Emma Gonzalez\u2019s \u201cWe call BS\u201d speech begins one song, I Rise. It follows, therefore, that a song called God Control is probably about gun control, as well as democracy and the state of the US. \u201cThis is your wake-up call!\u201d warns Madonna, before the whole thing is bathed in glitterball disco and topped off with a schoolyard sing-song rap about how Madonna doesn\u2019t take drugs.

And when I found out Bill Nighy was involved, I was over the moon. It\u2019s a really warm comedy, without being soppy or cheesy \u2013 it\u2019s wry and witty, with lots of surprising humour.</p> <p><strong>Like <em>Prevenge</em>, it seems to be about one thing (demonic possession, Scrabble) but actually deals with loss and grief. Is there something in the British psyche that struggles with articulating these things more directly?</strong><br>Definitely. It\u2019s about families not saying what they mean to each other, all that miscommunication. That\u2019s quite a British thing \u2013 everybody knows something\u2019s the case, but it\u2019s just never spoken about. And there\u2019s all this repression. The one positive is that it\u2019s often really funny. For me, <em>Prevenge</em> was an explosion, a primal scream about stuff we don\u2019t talk about, that we keep concealed and civilised. <em>Sometimes Always Never</em>, in a very gentle way, is really cathartic as well. It\u2019s about a family letting those emotions go and being healthier for it.</p> <p><strong>What was Bill Nighy like to work with?</strong><br>Amazing. I was slightly scared \u2013 just before we went to do a rehearsal, he gave this interview where he said he hated it when actors didn\u2019t learn their lines. I use a lot of improvisation, so I was terrified he was going to hate me. Then I turned up and Sam [Riley] was telling exactly the same story about this interview. But Bill could not have been lovelier on set. He\u2019s a consummate entertainer: he has all these amazing stories, where you sit all day and listen to the people he\u2019s met, the stuff he\u2019s done with his life. And Sam and I both really, really learned our lines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I come from live performance, so I really relish giving the audience a reaction, a visceral feeling</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>What did you find most satisfying about creating <em>Prevenge</em>?</strong><br>A sense of freedom. I was just like: \u201cAh, I get to do stuff the way I want, and everybody has to listen to me, because I\u2019m the director.\u201d I can\u2019t wait to direct again, which I\u2019m doing this summer: a film called <em>Time</em><em>stalker</em>, which I\u2019ve been working on for a couple of years. It\u2019s a fantasy, in a way, about reincarnation. It\u2019s going to be funny, but with bits of horror and melancholy.</p> <p><strong>Presumably, now that <em>Prevenge</em> has done well, it gives you more freedom?</strong><br>I think so. My dream is to be allowed to do my thing \u2013 it\u2019s this idea of an auteur. I don\u2019t know how many women get called auteurs, but I like the idea of it. It\u2019s a really pretentious word, which is partly why I like it, but it also means you get to do what you want.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the most challenging part of directing?</strong><br>Probably my fear that I might offend other actors by telling them what to do. The way I get around that is by just trusting them to do whatever they want. It will be different directing with a toddler as well: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/14/alice-lowe-on-violent-british-horror-comedy-prevenge\" title=\"\">before, she was in my tummy</a>, which makes her a lot easier to keep your eye on. Luckily, the company, Western Edge Pictures, who also did <em>Prevenge</em>, are so supportive of me being a mum \u2013 that is vital.</p> <p><strong>Is there a widening understanding of this in the industry?</strong><br>Definitely \u2013 there was a creche for the first time in Cannes this year, and I support Raising Films, a charity all about parents and carers working in the film industry. Being a film-maker shouldn\u2019t mean you have to be completely antisocial and never see your family \u2013 it\u2019s not very self-sustaining.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think it\u2019s taken so long to have women on screen \u2013 in things like <em>Prevenge</em>, <em>Killing Eve</em>, <em>Fleabag</em> \u2013 who behave badly but are still likable and three-dimensional?</strong><br>It\u2019s changed so much. Some of the reason I started writing was my frustration, as an actress, at the lack of diverse roles for women \u2013 they\u2019d be really one-dimensional and boring. But there\u2019s this whole wave coming through, which is really exciting. We pitched <em>Sightseers</em> as a TV idea a few years ago and no-one wanted it; they were like, \u201cYou can\u2019t have violence and comedy in the same show.\u201d That would seem ridiculous now \u2013 that\u2019s changed in just seven, eight years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91477033f7dc11f5b77f8c13b544a78114beebdd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91477033f7dc11f5b77f8c13b544a78114beebdd/0_145_2700_1621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alice Lowe in Prevenge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Primal scream\u2019: Alice Lowe in Prevenge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What do you think the future holds for choose-your-own-adventure type narratives, like <em>Bandersnatch</em>?</strong><br>I think there\u2019ll always be a place for conventional film, because there are always going to be people who want to know what the exact narrative is. It\u2019s like this weird thing with <em>Game of Thrones</em>, people going: \u201cWe want a different ending.\u201d But sometimes the best ending isn\u2019t an ending you want. You might not want the lead character to die, for example, but that\u2019s still the best ending of the film. It\u2019s interesting that people feel like they have the power to choose.</p> <p><strong>When you\u2019re writing, do you second-guess what the audience would want?</strong><br>I do, actually. I come from live performance, so I really relish giving the audience a reaction, a visceral feeling. That\u2019s why I\u2019m attracted to comedy and horror \u2013 there\u2019s a reaction there. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/sep/08/phoebe-waller-bridge-fleabag-killing-eve-transgressive-women\" title=\"\">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> [creator of <em>Fleabag</em> and <em>Killing Eve</em>] said something really interesting: that it\u2019s fine to scare people or shock them, but it\u2019s criminal to bore them \u2013 that\u2019s how I feel.</p> <p><strong>What do most people in the street recognise you for?</strong><br><em>Hot Fuzz</em>, bizarrely, because I think it\u2019s shown on ITV so often. But I don\u2019t get recognised generally. When you talk to taxi drivers or something, they go: \u201cWhat have you been in?\u201d So I list what I\u2019ve been in, and they\u2019re are like: \u201cNah, nah, nah.\u201d If someone does recognise me, it\u2019s actually quite nice, because I know they\u2019re a fan of really obscure comedy. Then I\u2019m like, OK, you\u2019re a nerd like me, nice to meet you.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bkoBWOI8FU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0bkoBWOI8FU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bkoBWOI8FU\">Watch the trailer for Sometimes Always Never.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>How has comedy changed since you first started out?</strong><br>There are a lot more women around, which is brilliant, I remember going to Edinburgh 20 years ago and feeling like I was the only woman there. And I think comedy has become less fantastical: there\u2019s less surrealism, which personally I quite miss. Things always go one way and then back again. So I think there\u2019s room for a return to more craziness in comedy, more weirdness. </p>",

I use a lot of improvisation, so I was terrified he was going to hate me. Then I turned up and Sam [Riley] was telling exactly the same story about this interview. But Bill could not have been lovelier on set. He\u2019s a consummate entertainer: he has all these amazing stories, where you sit all day and listen to the people he\u2019s met, the stuff he\u2019s done with his life. And Sam and I both really, really learned our lines. What did you find most satisfying about creating Prevenge? A sense of freedom. I was just like: \u201cAh, I get to do stuff the way I want, and everybody has to listen to me, because I\u2019m the director.\u201d I can\u2019t wait to direct again, which I\u2019m doing this summer: a film called Timestalker, which I\u2019ve been working on for a couple of years. It\u2019s a fantasy, in a way, about reincarnation. It\u2019s going to be funny, but with bits of horror and melancholy. Presumably, now that Prevenge has done well, it gives you more freedom? I think so. My dream is to be allowed to do my thing \u2013 it\u2019s this idea of an auteur. I don\u2019t know how many women get called auteurs, but I like the idea of it. It\u2019s a really pretentious word, which is partly why I like it, but it also means you get to do what you want. What\u2019s the most challenging part of directing? Probably my fear that I might offend other actors by telling them what to do. The way I get around that is by just trusting them to do whatever they want. It will be different directing with a toddler as well: before, she was in my tummy, which makes her a lot easier to keep your eye on. Luckily, the company, Western Edge Pictures, who also did Prevenge, are so supportive of me being a mum \u2013 that is vital. Is there a widening understanding of this in the industry? Definitely \u2013 there was a creche for the first time in Cannes this year, and I support Raising Films, a charity all about parents and carers working in the film industry. Being a film-maker shouldn\u2019t mean you have to be completely antisocial and never see your family \u2013 it\u2019s not very self-sustaining. Why do you think it\u2019s taken so long to have women on screen \u2013 in things like Prevenge, Killing Eve, Fleabag \u2013 who behave badly but are still likable and three-dimensional? It\u2019s changed so much. Some of the reason I started writing was my frustration, as an actress, at the lack of diverse roles for women \u2013 they\u2019d be really one-dimensional and boring. But there\u2019s this whole wave coming through, which is really exciting. We pitched Sightseers as a TV idea a few years ago and no-one wanted it; they were like, \u201cYou can\u2019t have violence and comedy in the same show.\u201d That would seem ridiculous now \u2013 that\u2019s changed in just seven, eight years. What do you think the future holds for choose-your-own-adventure type narratives, like Bandersnatch? I think there\u2019ll always be a place for conventional film, because there are always going to be people who want to know what the exact narrative is. It\u2019s like this weird thing with Game of Thrones, people going: \u201cWe want a different ending.\u201d But sometimes the best ending isn\u2019t an ending you want. You might not want the lead character to die, for example, but that\u2019s still the best ending of the film. It\u2019s interesting that people feel like they have the power to choose. When you\u2019re writing, do you second-guess what the audience would want? I do, actually. I come from live performance, so I really relish giving the audience a reaction, a visceral feeling. That\u2019s why I\u2019m attracted to comedy and horror \u2013 there\u2019s a reaction there. Phoebe Waller-Bridge [creator of Fleabag and Killing Eve] said something really interesting: that it\u2019s fine to scare people or shock them, but it\u2019s criminal to bore them \u2013 that\u2019s how I feel. What do most people in the street recognise you for? Hot Fuzz, bizarrely, because I think it\u2019s shown on ITV so often. But I don\u2019t get recognised generally. When you talk to taxi drivers or something, they go: \u201cWhat have you been in?\u201d So I list what I\u2019ve been in, and they\u2019re are like: \u201cNah, nah, nah.\u201d If someone does recognise me, it\u2019s actually quite nice, because I know they\u2019re a fan of really obscure comedy. Then I\u2019m like, OK, you\u2019re a nerd like me, nice to meet you. How has comedy changed since you first started out? There are a lot more women around, which is brilliant, I remember going to Edinburgh 20 years ago and feeling like I was the only woman there. And I think comedy has become less fantastical: there\u2019s less surrealism, which personally I quite miss. Things always go one way and then back again. So I think there\u2019s room for a return to more craziness in comedy, more weirdness.",

Colleagues and friends believe he is being targeted for his work on state corruption and business interests.</p> <p>Two separate teams of doctors suggested Golunov be taken to hospital for x-rays but police investigators refused. The injuries were sustained while Golunov was in custody, his lawyer Dmitri Dzhulai confirmed by text message.</p> <p>Golunov was later taken to a Moscow hospital, several Russian outlets reported. He had earlier complained police punched and kicked him about the head and chest because he refused to sign a police report before he had access to a lawyer.</p> <p>He was formally charged on Saturday with drug possession with intent to sell, a crime that carries a prison sentence of between 10 and 20 years. Police said that they found 3.56 grams of the clubbing drug mephedrone in a backpack belonging to Golunov and 5.42 grams of cocaine in an apartment he purportedly rented in Moscow. Golunov has said the drugs were planted.</p> <p>The court placed him under two months\u2019 house arrest while the charges are investigated, rejecting a request from investigators to hold him in custody.</p> <p>Hundreds of people protested against his arrest outside Moscow\u2019s police headquarters on Friday, holding signs in support reading: \u201cMy name is Ivan Golunov. I am a journalist. Arrest me, too.\u201d</p> <p>Police had also demanded Golunov sign a confession, Dzhulai said. Russian investigators often put suspects in criminal cases under pressure in order to sobtain confessions, which makes it far easier to secure a conviction.</p> <p>Police have also tried to limit the public flow of information about the case, demanding that Golunov\u2019s lawyers sign non-disclosure agreements. They have refused.</p> <p>Golunov has investigated family members of a Moscow deputy mayor who amassed a fortune in real estate, predatory lenders who purchased apartments in Moscow, plans to ship Moscow\u2019s waste to the regions, and the efforts of a senior official\u2019s son to corner Russia\u2019s funeral market.</p> <p>He had been receiving threats before his arrest, his editors said.</p> <p>\u201cIvan Golunov is a prominent critic and his investigations into government corruption clearly did not go down well with the authorities. It seems he is now paying the price,\u201d said Natalia Zviagina, the director of Amnesty International\u2019s Russia office . \u201cThe circumstances of Ivan Golunov\u2019s detention sound dubious and follow a depressingly familiar pattern.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A Russian investigative journalist arrested on controversial drug charges has been severely beaten in custody, his lawyer has said. A doctor who inspected Ivan Golunov said he may have suffered broken ribs, concussion and a haematoma. Golunov, a reporter for the independent Meduza news website, was arrested on drug charges on Friday. Colleagues and friends believe he is being targeted for his work on state corruption and business interests. Two separate teams of doctors suggested Golunov be taken to hospital for x-rays but police investigators refused. The injuries were sustained while Golunov was in custody, his lawyer Dmitri Dzhulai confirmed by text message. Golunov was later taken to a Moscow hospital, several Russian outlets reported. He had earlier complained police punched and kicked him about the head and chest because he refused to sign a police report before he had access to a lawyer. He was formally charged on Saturday with drug possession with intent to sell, a crime that carries a prison sentence of between 10 and 20 years. Police said that they found 3.56 grams of the clubbing drug mephedrone in a backpack belonging to Golunov and 5.42 grams of cocaine in an apartment he purportedly rented in Moscow. Golunov has said the drugs were planted. The court placed him under two months\u2019 house arrest while the charges are investigated, rejecting a request from investigators to hold him in custody. Hundreds of people protested against his arrest outside Moscow\u2019s police headquarters on Friday, holding signs in support reading: \u201cMy name is Ivan Golunov. I am a journalist. Arrest me, too.\u201d Police had also demanded Golunov sign a confession, Dzhulai said. Russian investigators often put suspects in criminal cases under pressure in order to sobtain confessions, which makes it far easier to secure a conviction. Police have also tried to limit the public flow of information about the case, demanding that Golunov\u2019s lawyers sign non-disclosure agreements. They have refused. Golunov has investigated family members of a Moscow deputy mayor who amassed a fortune in real estate, predatory lenders who purchased apartments in Moscow, plans to ship Moscow\u2019s waste to the regions, and the efforts of a senior official\u2019s son to corner Russia\u2019s funeral market. He had been receiving threats before his arrest, his editors said. \u201cIvan Golunov is a prominent critic and his investigations into government corruption clearly did not go down well with the authorities. It seems he is now paying the price,\u201d said Natalia Zviagina, the director of Amnesty International\u2019s Russia office . \u201cThe circumstances of Ivan Golunov\u2019s detention sound dubious and follow a depressingly familiar pattern.\u201d",

It\u2019s refreshing to hear how frank and honest she is - so unusual in modern sport. I think netball fans will see some similarities between de Vanna and Collingwood\u2019s Nat Medhurst - from the 1984 birthdate to the willingness to speak her mind to the refusal to accept less than perfection from herself and those around her.

Not at their best until the second half, Melbourne were irrepressible in fighting back from 10-2 down late in the first half in Auckland on Saturday to register a fourth straight win. It was their eighth successive defeat of the Warriors, who slump to a 4-8 record and are gazing at a sizeable task to play finals football.</p> <p>Kiwi-born Hughes was the chief executioner, bagging the first double of his NRL career with crucial tries either side of halftime. The 24-year-old did so after switching to halfback, where he played the last 50 minutes after Brodie Croft was forced off with a head knock. His energy, the craft of Cameron Smith and the toil of a pack led by Dale Finucane allowed Melbourne to take control of a match dogged by blustery winds and a high penalty count.</p> <p>Despite fielding Josh Addo-Carr, Will Chambers, Cameron Munster and Felise Kaufusi three days after their State of Origin duty, they owned the second half, scoring 24 unanswered points. </p> <p>Kodi Nikorima was a central figure in all three first-half tries as the Warriors ground out a 10-8 lead. Nikorima\u2019s speed created space for impressive left winger Ken Maumalo to bag his ninth try of the term. The diminutive five-eighth then crossed courtesy of a Blake Green grubber.</p> <p>However, Nikorima was the villain when Hughes stepped inside him after a neat Smith blindside switch. Hughes strolled over for his second in contentious fashion, with the Bunker ignoring Warriors claims of obstruction from Finucane on Issac Luke.</p> <p>Melbourne\u2019s late dominance resulted in tries to Suliasi Vunivalu, Jesse Bromwich and Marion Seve. The Bromwich try was meritorious given Melbourne had been reduced to 12 players following the sin-binning of Christian Welsh for persistent team offending.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfb60e08f0895eae9512afa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T07:22:18.694Z\">8.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Super Netball: </strong>The Adelaide Thunderbirds nearly caused an almighty upset this afternoon in Darwin, up by one goal going into the final quarter against defending premiers Sunshine Coast Lightning.

The Blues conceded the first six goals of Saturday\u2019s game before mounting a Patrick Cripps-inspired comeback to prevail 11.12 (78) to 9.9 (63), less than a week after sacking fourth-year coach Brendon Bolton.</p> <p>Cripps was sublime for Carlton in just their second win for the season, gathering 38 disposals and booting four goals in another performance certain to net him three Brownlow Medal votes. The brilliant skipper put the result beyond doubt in the dying minutes when he soared out of a pack and kicked truly for his fourth major.</p> <p>Ed Curnow (30 disposals, eight clearances) was also influential in the midfield and helped to quell the influence of Brisbane ball magnet Lachie Neale, while younger brother Charlie booted three goals in his best game of the season. Neale racked up 24 disposals to halftime but managed just seven after Curnow went to him in the second half.</p> <p>After witnessing North Melbourne upset Richmond in Rhyce Shaw\u2019s first game in charge, Carlton fans were hoping their own caretaker coach would conjure something similar. But six minutes into the second quarter, Brisbane held a six-goal lead and the Blues were yet to kick a major. The Blues had 10 of the first 11 inside-50s but continued to waste their opportunities, allowing Brisbane to seize the momentum.</p> <p>Quick goals to Charlie Cameron, Neale and Hugh McCluggage extended the Lions\u2019 lead to six goals before Michael Gibbons finally put the Blues on the board at the 12-minute mark of the second term. Having reduced the margin to three goals at halftime, the Blues came out firing in the third quarter as Cripps booted two goals in quick succession. Mitch McGovern then took a strong contested mark and kicked truly to put Carlton ahead and pave the way for a much-needed victory.</p> <p>Key defender Harris Andrews held Harry McKay goalless and was among Brisbane\u2019s best but the Lions were well-beaten in the midfield. The Blues host the Western Bulldogs at Marvel Stadium next Saturday while the fifth-placed Lions head into their mid-season bye with seven wins and five losses, having blown a golden opportunity to remain in touch with the top four.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf9f4be8f0803f2a595c4c4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/megan-maurice\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T07:05:19.296Z\">8.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Hello and welcome to a big night in sport!

Don\u2019t forget to stay with us for our live blogs of the Cricket World Cup, Women\u2019s World Cup and the French Open during the night. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow to take you through a big Sunday of sport! So long and thanks for all the fish. An upset victory from Adelaide at home will give them no end of confidence, toppling the second placed Giants by 21 points. Josh Jenkins continued his dominance in the second half, ably supported by Taylor Walker. Unbelievably it was a third draw in four games for the West Coast Fever. Netball legend Liz Ellis called for extra time during the week after a glut of draws this season and it looks like many fans will be rallying behind her after this game. Both teams squandered late chances, Kaylia Stanton throwing a baffling pass out the back of the court with 30 seconds remaining, only for the Giants to work it down to Caitlin Bassett who slotted a shot after the final whistle that was ruled no goal. Player of the match and Giants captain Kim Green was noticeably upset with the result. \u201cAt the end of the day, we didn\u2019t come here for a draw, so we\u2019re really disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to become a little bit better in those critical moments. We\u2019re not going to celebrate a draw.\u201d Cricket World Cup: Checking in on our England v Bangladesh live blog and England are doing it fairly easy so far in their innings. Bangladesh will need a big batting performance if they want to cause an upset in Cardiff today. Head on over to the blog to keep up with the latest in this match. A big second half effort from the Sea Eagles got them the two points in Townsville tonight. Two tries to nil in the second half got Manly over the line - a strong effort in attack and defence to keep the Cowboys scoreless for the half. Daly Cherry-Evans backed up from his State of Origin captaincy on Wednesday night and was very happy with his team\u2019s effort. When asked the difference to the Eagles of 2018 he was considered in his answer. \u201cI think we\u2019re making ourselves accountable to play good footy every week,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cWe\u2019re demanding consistency and while the last two weeks maybe didn\u2019t reflect that, we\u2019re working hard on it.\u201d The second half was better than the first for the Waratahs, finishing with a consolation try after the siren, but it wasn\u2019t enough to take the points and creep into second place on the Australian conference ladder. The Brumbies won\u2019t be happy with their second half defence and will need to improve heading into finals in a couple of weeks. Brumbies play maker Christian Lealiifano was happy the team wrapped up top spot with a round remaining. \u201cPleased to get the result tonight, top of the conference is really nice,\u201d he said after the match \u201cWe took our opportunities in the first half, we tried to play reasonably simple and our forward pack did their job.\u201d Cricket World Cup: An update on the injured net bowler from our man on the ground Adam Collins - he has apparently been taken to hospital as a precaution. Hopefully a quick recovery for him. Super Netball: The Giants have the half-time lead at Perth Arena, up 32-28 at half-time. The Giants have both bonus points so far, which is bad news for the Fever who need every point they can get their hands on after a poor start to the season. Also concerning for the home side are goal attack Kaylia Stanton\u2019s shooting stats - yet to score after 30 minutes. AFL: Adelaide hold a narrow lead over GWS at half-time, ahead 4.7 (31) to 3.4 (22). Josh Jenkins doing some great work for the home side so far, with six disposals and two goals to his name in the first half. Cricket World Cup: A local net bowler suffered a head injury during a training session with the Australian team at the Oval. From AAP: A local net bowler had to be stretchered from the ground after being struck in the head by a David Warner straight drive in Australia\u2019s training session at The Oval. Australia were completing preparations for Sunday\u2019s game against India when Warner drove a half-volley back towards the medium pacer. The ball struck the bowler in the head. He went to ground and required urgent medical assistance before being taken off in a medicab. The Australian team showed immediate concern for the bowler, with training stopped for more than 10 minutes. Warner was comforted by assistant coach Ricky Ponting while he checked on the man\u2019s welfare and did not immediately resume batting. Super Rugby: The Waratahs were handed a brilliant opportunity to leapfrog the Rebels into second place on the Australian conference ladder, but they\u2019re not looking like making use of it, trailing the Brumbies 28-3 at half-time. The Brumbies have shared the scoring load, while Christian Lealiifano has been spot on with the boot, nailing all four conversions. NRL: Half time in Townsville and the Cowboys lead the Sea Eagles 20-12. It\u2019s all about Jake Clifford for the North Queenslanders tonight - he has scored all three of their tries, including the clincher right on the siren. The Sea Eagles won\u2019t be happy with their finish to the half, blowing a 12-2 lead to go into the break behind. AFL: Very thought provoking discussion from ID9357571 in the comments regarding the AFL\u2019s apology to Adam Goodes this week: \u201cSo the apology from the AFL - three and half years after the collective crime committed against this generations greatest Indigenous footballer, in direct response to two documentaries outlining their complicity in his despicable and racist treatment - smacks of a brand damage limitation exercise. And embarrassingly not so subtle given the previewing of the documentaries by the AFL. Let me know your thoughts, either in the comments or on Twitter, was it a genuine apology or simply a case of damage control? French Open: We\u2019ve got live blogs galore tonight! Head on over to our French Open blog as we follow along with an exciting semi final between Novak Djokovic and Dominic Thiem. Super Netball: After the dust settled from the Diamonds selections last week, the harsh reality of taking a mid-season break in the Super Netball began to sink in. Already it has had an impact, with the NSW Swifts this week announcing that they will allow English import Natalie Haythornthwaite to rest until the World Cup, not taking the court for her Super Netball franchise until after the completion of the tournament. There are all kinds of complications that arise from this five week break in play, which Erin Delahunty broke down beautifully in her column this week. Well, things didn\u2019t get any better for the Rebels in the second half. If you can believe it, things actually got worse. Brandon Ennor and Sevu Reece each bagged a hat trick for the Crusaders and the Rebels differential has taken one hell of a hammering. A win for the Waratahs over the Brumbies tonight will see them leapfrog their southern rivals into second place on the Australian conference ladder. While they couldn\u2019t stretch the lead further with a conversion attempt after the siren, there is plenty to celebrate for the Sharks tonight. A dominant 20-point win over the Eels will do a lot for their confidence at this stage of the season and will keep them safely inside the eight. In more good news for the boys from the Shire, Wade Graham made a successful return to the field tonight, playing his first game in nine months after rupturing his ACL in last year\u2019s qualifying final. \u201cI felt good,\u201d said Graham after the game. \u201cThe lungs need a bit of work, but it was a relief to get out there. Glad it\u2019s done and now I can get into the season. It was pretty disappointing we let those tries in late, but we got the win and that\u2019s what matters.\u201d Hopefully the team will shout him a soft serve at Engadine Maccas tonight to celebrate. It wasn\u2019t the second half the Kangaroos would have wanted, but they will be pleased to take the four points out of this one. The Suns will take heart from a stronger second half but will rue the fact that it was too little, too late. Kangaroos forward Mason Wood was pleased with his form in the game, but was quick to credit his team for his good work. \u201cI\u2019m a product of how the team\u2019s going - three wins from the last three games has been great,\u201d he said after the game. Cricket World Cup: The England v Bangladesh match is about to get underway in Cardiff. Join Rob Smyth and Adam Collins for over-by-over updates and see if Bangladesh can sneak in a win against the hosts. NBA: Interesting talking point out of the US this week with news that the NBA wants to increase female coaches and referees with the aim to hit 50%. Though I find the line \u201cI\u2019m not sure how it was so male-dominated for so long\u201d from NBA commissioner Adam Silver quite staggering. I have a few ideas, starting with wilful exclusion, that I could share with him if he\u2019s open to it. Cricket World Cup: Have you listened to The Guardian\u2019s new cricket podcast The Spin yet? It\u2019s a cracker of an episode this week as Emma John is joined by Rob Eastaway and Jon Harvey to discuss why cricket was better in the 90s. It\u2019s only 39 minutes long, so plenty of time to listen before England v Bangladesh starts. Super Rugby: Things aren\u2019t looking quite so happy for the Melbourne Rebels, trailing 26-0 to the seemingly unstoppable Crusaders. It illustrates the stark difference between the Australian and New Zealand conferences, with the Crusaders first of the Kiwis and the Rebels second on the Australian ladder. NRL: Half time at Shark Park and the home side are looking happy with a 14-point lead over Parramatta. A Josh Dugan try right on the hooter sets them up for a big second half and the chance to push their advantage home for a much needed boost to their points differential. French Open: If you\u2019re planning to be up late watching Ash Barty play in the French Open final, make sure you check out our Guardian live blog for the best insights live from Roland-Garros. To get you ready for the #BartyParty, have a read of Simon Cambers\u2019 great analysis of the rise of this young star. State of Origin: The NSW team for the women\u2019s State of Origin was named today, with Kezie Apps to lead the team for the first time. 2018 captain Maddie Studdon retains her spot but has been asked to concentrate on her half back duties. I think my favourite story of the team is 43-year-old Kylie Hilder who comes back into the side at hooker after a decade. If that\u2019s not a comeback, I don\u2019t know what is. Women\u2019s World Cup: What a week of build up it\u2019s been - we\u2019re all just itching for the Matildas to get underway against Italy tomorrow night. During the week, our sensational football reporter Richard Parkin caught up with Matildas veteran Lisa de Vanna to get her thoughts on the team\u2019s preparation. It\u2019s refreshing to hear how frank and honest she is - so unusual in modern sport. I think netball fans will see some similarities between de Vanna and Collingwood\u2019s Nat Medhurst - from the 1984 birthdate to the willingness to speak her mind to the refusal to accept less than perfection from herself and those around her. A fascinating read. AFL: Half-time on the Gold Coast sees the Kangaroos with a solid early lead over the Suns 9.5 (59) to 4.3 (27). A big win tonight could put North Melbourne in touch with the top eight, so they will be looking to build in the second half and get a big percentage booster out of this one. NRL: Across the ditch the Storm were too strong for the Warriors, running out 22-point winners over the New Zealanders. From AAP: Hughes stars in Storm win over Warriors A breakout performance from Melbourne fullback Jahrome Hughes has helped orchestrate a 32-10 win over the Warriors that ensures the Storm top the standings at the midway point of the NRL season. Not at their best until the second half, Melbourne were irrepressible in fighting back from 10-2 down late in the first half in Auckland on Saturday to register a fourth straight win. It was their eighth successive defeat of the Warriors, who slump to a 4-8 record and are gazing at a sizeable task to play finals football. Kiwi-born Hughes was the chief executioner, bagging the first double of his NRL career with crucial tries either side of halftime. The 24-year-old did so after switching to halfback, where he played the last 50 minutes after Brodie Croft was forced off with a head knock. His energy, the craft of Cameron Smith and the toil of a pack led by Dale Finucane allowed Melbourne to take control of a match dogged by blustery winds and a high penalty count. Despite fielding Josh Addo-Carr, Will Chambers, Cameron Munster and Felise Kaufusi three days after their State of Origin duty, they owned the second half, scoring 24 unanswered points. Kodi Nikorima was a central figure in all three first-half tries as the Warriors ground out a 10-8 lead. Nikorima\u2019s speed created space for impressive left winger Ken Maumalo to bag his ninth try of the term. The diminutive five-eighth then crossed courtesy of a Blake Green grubber. However, Nikorima was the villain when Hughes stepped inside him after a neat Smith blindside switch. Hughes strolled over for his second in contentious fashion, with the Bunker ignoring Warriors claims of obstruction from Finucane on Issac Luke. Melbourne\u2019s late dominance resulted in tries to Suliasi Vunivalu, Jesse Bromwich and Marion Seve. The Bromwich try was meritorious given Melbourne had been reduced to 12 players following the sin-binning of Christian Welsh for persistent team offending. Super Netball: The Adelaide Thunderbirds nearly caused an almighty upset this afternoon in Darwin, up by one goal going into the final quarter against defending premiers Sunshine Coast Lightning. The late injection of Ugandan star Peace Proscovia sealed the deal for the Queenslanders, but there were promising signs from persistent cellar dwellers the Thunderbirds during the game. Talking to new Super Netball Commission Chair Marina Go during the week, she emphasised that the league is only as strong as its weakest team and the rise of the Thunderbirds will be heartening for competition organisers to see. AFL: Big news for Carlton this afternoon, coming from behind to beat Brisbane in David Teague\u2019s first game as head coach. From AAP: Carlton have climbed off the canvas in David Teague\u2019s first AFL game in charge, coming from behind to defeat Brisbane by 15 points at Marvel Stadium. The Blues conceded the first six goals of Saturday\u2019s game before mounting a Patrick Cripps-inspired comeback to prevail 11.12 (78) to 9.9 (63), less than a week after sacking fourth-year coach Brendon Bolton. Cripps was sublime for Carlton in just their second win for the season, gathering 38 disposals and booting four goals in another performance certain to net him three Brownlow Medal votes. The brilliant skipper put the result beyond doubt in the dying minutes when he soared out of a pack and kicked truly for his fourth major. Ed Curnow (30 disposals, eight clearances) was also influential in the midfield and helped to quell the influence of Brisbane ball magnet Lachie Neale, while younger brother Charlie booted three goals in his best game of the season. Neale racked up 24 disposals to halftime but managed just seven after Curnow went to him in the second half. After witnessing North Melbourne upset Richmond in Rhyce Shaw\u2019s first game in charge, Carlton fans were hoping their own caretaker coach would conjure something similar. But six minutes into the second quarter, Brisbane held a six-goal lead and the Blues were yet to kick a major. The Blues had 10 of the first 11 inside-50s but continued to waste their opportunities, allowing Brisbane to seize the momentum. Quick goals to Charlie Cameron, Neale and Hugh McCluggage extended the Lions\u2019 lead to six goals before Michael Gibbons finally put the Blues on the board at the 12-minute mark of the second term. Having reduced the margin to three goals at halftime, the Blues came out firing in the third quarter as Cripps booted two goals in quick succession. Mitch McGovern then took a strong contested mark and kicked truly to put Carlton ahead and pave the way for a much-needed victory. Key defender Harris Andrews held Harry McKay goalless and was among Brisbane\u2019s best but the Lions were well-beaten in the midfield. The Blues host the Western Bulldogs at Marvel Stadium next Saturday while the fifth-placed Lions head into their mid-season bye with seven wins and five losses, having blown a golden opportunity to remain in touch with the top four. Hello and welcome to a big night in sport! We\u2019ve got lots going on tonight, with NRL, AFL, Super Netball and Super Rugby on the agenda. We\u2019ll also have standalone blogs later in the night for the Cricket World Cup matches, Women\u2019s World Cup and of course the French Open. So let\u2019s get into it!",

It\u2019s not just a pleasant place to eat his lunch; he believes the time spent under the trees\u2019 canopy is a critical factor in the fight against diseases, of the mind and body. Once a month Li spends three days in forests near Tokyo, using all five senses to connect with the environment and clear his mind.

On Wednesday, Biden\u2019s campaign confirmed that the candidate still supports the Hyde amendment, which stops federal Medicaid funding being used for most abortion services. Less than 24 hours later, following intense criticism from reproductive rights groups and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/elizabeth-warren-biden-abortion-video-response-clip-msnbc-town-hall\">other Democratic candidates</a>, Biden announced he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/abortion-joe-biden-hyde-amendment\">didn\u2019t support the amendment</a>, after all.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability ... to exercise their constitutional protected right [to abortion],\u201d Biden said at a fundraising gala on Thursday. The devout Roman Catholic explained that he\u2019d changed his longstanding position on the 43-year-old law because banning federal funding for abortion services hadn\u2019t, he believed, previously prevented low-income women from accessing the procedure.</p> <p>\u201cThere was sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right [to an abortion], women of color, poor women,\u201d Biden said. He further noted that the right to an abortion wasn\u2019t previously under attack \u201cas it is now\u201d.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with politicians changing their minds; however there is a big difference between genuinely evolving your views and disingenuous flip-flopping. Biden\u2019s abrupt reversal on the Hyde amendment would seem to be the latter: women should hold out no hope that Biden will actually act on his new-found beliefs.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s explanation for his U-turn isn\u2019t just disingenuous \u2013 his assertion that the Hyde amendment didn\u2019t previously prevent poorer women from accessing abortion services is downright dishonest. There is a mountain of research from both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups showing that the Hyde amendment prevented huge numbers of women from accessing safe and legal abortions. Studies show that the birthrate among women on Medicaid increased by 13% after the amendment was passed, for example. And a <a href=\"https://s27589.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/OP_hyde_9.28.3.pdf\">2016 report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute</a>, an anti-abortion organization, asserts that since 1976 the amendment is responsible for over two million births.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/abortion-joe-biden-hyde-amendment\">Biden abruptly drops support for 'discriminatory' abortion rule</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Hyde amendment hasn\u2019t just compelled women to give birth against their wishes; it has killed them. Biden\u2019s blithe avowal that there were \u201csufficient monies and circumstances\u201d to help poor women access abortions in the past insults the memory of women like <a href=\"https://www.texasobserver.org/rosie-jimenez-abortion-medicaid/\">Rosie Jimenez</a>, who died because they couldn\u2019t afford a safe abortion.</p> <p>Centrists frequently scold the left for having unreasonable exceptions of politicians, asserting that we shouldn\u2019t expect our politicians to be \u201cideologically pure\u201d. That\u2019s fair enough, but we should expect our politicians to have a functioning moral compass. We should expect them to take responsibility for their actions and apologize when they are wrong. We should expect them to take women\u2019s rights seriously. If Biden had genuinely evolved in his attitudes toward abortion he would have acknowledged the much-documented impact of the Hyde amendment and apologized for supporting it. (Particularly considering that he didn\u2019t just support the law, he repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6127591-biden77letter.html\">tried to prevent rape and incest exceptions</a> from being added to it.) But Biden seems to be allergic to taking responsibility \u2013 \u201cI make no apologies for my last position,\u201d he announced on Thursday.</p> <p>Biden has demonstrated time and time again that he doesn\u2019t take women\u2019s rights seriously, that he doesn\u2019t take women seriously. He\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/25/joe-biden-anita-hill-not-satisfied-with-former-vice-presidents-apology\">declined to take any real responsibility</a> for how he handled Anita Hill\u2019s testimony against Clarence Thomas, for example. And he\u2019s treated allegations of unwanted touching <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-jokes-about-touching-women-new-hampshire-2019-6\">as one big joke</a>. He presents himself as the anti-Trump but the reality is that Trump and Biden are two sides of the same misogynistic coin. Trump\u2019s disdain for women manifests itself in crass braggadocio, Biden\u2019s in patronizing paternalism. Women should cut Biden no slack just because he isn\u2019t Trump: we deserve far better.</p> <h2>My wiiiiiiife, I love my wife</h2> <p>It\u2019s been a big week for Internet Wife Guy analysis, with <a href=\"http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/05/cliff-wife-vs-curvy-wife-online-wife-guys-explained.html\">New York Magazine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/05/arts/internet-wife-guy-robbie-tripp.html\">the New York Times</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/please-my-wife-shes-very-online\">the New Yorker</a> all weighing in on the phenomenon. A Wife Guy, for those who aren\u2019t Extremely Online, is someone who has crafted a personal brand by posting a lot of Wife Content. According to the Times \u201cthe identification and mocking of \u2018wife guys\u2019 evidences a mild discomfort with the tradition of marriage itself \u2026[but is also] a specific reaction to marriage in its current form, as a highly individualized pursuit in which a man may express his purest self\u201d.</p> <h2>Japan\u2019s painful high heel debate</h2> <p>Japan\u2019s health and labour minister, Takumi Nemoto, has said that it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/high-heels-at-work-are-necessary-says-japan-labour-minister\">is \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d</a> for women to wear high heels at work.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. Women deserve better than Biden Congratulations to Joe Biden, who may have just set a new record for the world\u2019s fastest flip-flop. On Wednesday, Biden\u2019s campaign confirmed that the candidate still supports the Hyde amendment, which stops federal Medicaid funding being used for most abortion services. Less than 24 hours later, following intense criticism from reproductive rights groups and other Democratic candidates, Biden announced he didn\u2019t support the amendment, after all. \u201cI can\u2019t justify leaving millions of women without access to the care they need and the ability ... to exercise their constitutional protected right [to abortion],\u201d Biden said at a fundraising gala on Thursday. The devout Roman Catholic explained that he\u2019d changed his longstanding position on the 43-year-old law because banning federal funding for abortion services hadn\u2019t, he believed, previously prevented low-income women from accessing the procedure. \u201cThere was sufficient monies and circumstances where women were able to exercise that right [to an abortion], women of color, poor women,\u201d Biden said. He further noted that the right to an abortion wasn\u2019t previously under attack \u201cas it is now\u201d. There is nothing wrong with politicians changing their minds; however there is a big difference between genuinely evolving your views and disingenuous flip-flopping. Biden\u2019s abrupt reversal on the Hyde amendment would seem to be the latter: women should hold out no hope that Biden will actually act on his new-found beliefs. Biden\u2019s explanation for his U-turn isn\u2019t just disingenuous \u2013 his assertion that the Hyde amendment didn\u2019t previously prevent poorer women from accessing abortion services is downright dishonest. There is a mountain of research from both pro-choice and anti-abortion groups showing that the Hyde amendment prevented huge numbers of women from accessing safe and legal abortions. Studies show that the birthrate among women on Medicaid increased by 13% after the amendment was passed, for example. And a 2016 report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, an anti-abortion organization, asserts that since 1976 the amendment is responsible for over two million births. The Hyde amendment hasn\u2019t just compelled women to give birth against their wishes; it has killed them. Biden\u2019s blithe avowal that there were \u201csufficient monies and circumstances\u201d to help poor women access abortions in the past insults the memory of women like Rosie Jimenez, who died because they couldn\u2019t afford a safe abortion. Centrists frequently scold the left for having unreasonable exceptions of politicians, asserting that we shouldn\u2019t expect our politicians to be \u201cideologically pure\u201d. That\u2019s fair enough, but we should expect our politicians to have a functioning moral compass. We should expect them to take responsibility for their actions and apologize when they are wrong. We should expect them to take women\u2019s rights seriously. If Biden had genuinely evolved in his attitudes toward abortion he would have acknowledged the much-documented impact of the Hyde amendment and apologized for supporting it. (Particularly considering that he didn\u2019t just support the law, he repeatedly tried to prevent rape and incest exceptions from being added to it.) But Biden seems to be allergic to taking responsibility \u2013 \u201cI make no apologies for my last position,\u201d he announced on Thursday. Biden has demonstrated time and time again that he doesn\u2019t take women\u2019s rights seriously, that he doesn\u2019t take women seriously. He\u2019s declined to take any real responsibility for how he handled Anita Hill\u2019s testimony against Clarence Thomas, for example. And he\u2019s treated allegations of unwanted touching as one big joke. He presents himself as the anti-Trump but the reality is that Trump and Biden are two sides of the same misogynistic coin. Trump\u2019s disdain for women manifests itself in crass braggadocio, Biden\u2019s in patronizing paternalism. Women should cut Biden no slack just because he isn\u2019t Trump: we deserve far better. My wiiiiiiife, I love my wife It\u2019s been a big week for Internet Wife Guy analysis, with New York Magazine, the New York Times, and the New Yorker all weighing in on the phenomenon. A Wife Guy, for those who aren\u2019t Extremely Online, is someone who has crafted a personal brand by posting a lot of Wife Content. According to the Times \u201cthe identification and mocking of \u2018wife guys\u2019 evidences a mild discomfort with the tradition of marriage itself \u2026[but is also] a specific reaction to marriage in its current form, as a highly individualized pursuit in which a man may express his purest self\u201d. Japan\u2019s painful high heel debate Japan\u2019s health and labour minister, Takumi Nemoto, has said that it is \u201cnecessary and appropriate\u201d for women to wear high heels at work. Nemoto\u2019s remarks were in response to a campaign called #KuToo, that asks the government to ban employers from forcing professional women to wear heels. I reckon Nemoto should be forced to wear stilettos for a week and see if he still feels the same. Some morons in Boston are planning \u2018Straight Pride\u2019 The organizers aren\u2019t just attention-seeking homophobes, they\u2019ve also got worrying ties to white supremacist groups. Australian female soccer players score a pay victory There\u2019s a huge gender pay gap in professional sports, however some progress is slowly being made to fix it. On Friday, the Football Federation Australia announced that professional women soccer players will get the same base pay as men. Meanwhile, in America, the US women\u2019s national team is suing US Soccer for years of \u201cinstitutionalized gender discrimination\u201d. The quilts that made America quake I had the privilege of interviewing Faith Ringgold, a true feminist icon, recently for the Guardian.

Hirzel wanted to show the value of these efforts: the series felt like a duty, he says, to victims and their families.</p> <p>As part of the project, Hirzel travelled to Senegal, where he met the family of Mamadou; he had been missing for two years and is thought to have been one of the victims of the 18 April sinking. \u201cPeople in Italy say: \u2018Why should we spend all this money when no one is looking for them?\u2019\u201d says Hirzel. \u201cBut Mamadou\u2019s family had been looking for him, in their own way: his brothers visited holy men in Gambia and Senegal to find out what had happened to him. Everybody is waiting.\u201d Red Cross psychologist Miriam Orteiza said to Hirzel: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible for families to face their grief until there\u2019s a body, until there is certainty. This is why it\u2019s important.\u201d</p> <p>In Syracuse, Sicily, police officer <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2017/04/locating-missing-refugees-social-media/\" title=\"\">Angelo Milazzo</a> spent months working on the case of a migrant shipwreck that occurred in August 2014. He set up a Facebook page to share material with families, and eventually identified 23 out of 24 bodies. \u201cOne of these was Bilal,\u201d says Hirzel, \u201cthe 16-year-old brother of Mohamed Matok. Angelo and Mohamed spoke for years over email and Whatsapp, using Google Translate, and they became friends.\u201d Matok obtained a visa to come from Damascus to pray over his brother\u2019s grave; Hirzel photographed the visit. \u201cWhen he met Angelo at the airport they embraced, and Mohamed said to me: \u2018Angelo is an angel. Knowing where my brother is, being able to pick up his belongings \u2013 what he did for me was so important.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Hirzel\u2019s photographs will be on show at <em><a href=\"https://www.sinkwithouttrace.com/\">Sink Without Trace</a></em>, the first UK exhibition to focus specifically on the more than 30,000 migrants who have drowned in the Mediterranean over the past 30 years. It will feature work from 18 artists from 10 countries, including seven who migrated by sea as refugees. \u201cIt\u2019s a subject that\u2019s hardly dealt with in galleries here,\u201d says artist <a href=\"http://www.mayaramsay.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Maya Ramsay</a>, who curated the exhibition with <a href=\"https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/mazzara-federica\">Federica Mazzara</a>, senior lecturer at the University of Westminster. \u201cPart of me wonders whether it\u2019s partly to do with a sense of culpability, that we\u2019re not doing anything about the subject, that we\u2019re partly responsible.

      "bodyText": "It was 2011 when Italian photojournalist Max Hirzel first started thinking about the identification of migrant bodies. He was working on a project in Mali when he met a young man named Alpha, who told him about a grave he\u2019d seen in the desert of a girl from his native Cameroon. Alpha wondered if her parents and siblings knew she was there, adding that this scared him more than death itself: the idea of being buried alone in a graveyard where no one could mourn him. The project began in earnest in 2015, when Hirzel started touring cemeteries in Sicily to photograph migrants\u2019 graves. Then, on 18 April, the deadliest modern shipwreck in the Mediterranean happened: a vessel carrying between 700 and 1,100 people sank between Libya and Italy; only 28 survived. Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister at the time, vowed to salvage the ship in an effort to identify the bodies and give them a proper burial, and the vessel \u2013 now known as \u201cthe boat of innocents\u201d \u2013 was pulled to the surface in June 2016. The bodies on board were taken to a Nato base in Melilli, Sicily, where forensic doctors performed autopsies; further testing was done at the Labanof laboratory in Milan by a team of pathologists, many of them very young, led by Dr Cristina Cattaneo.

But Eleftheratou and her team worked over an area three times that size, discovering close to 50,000 artefacts, including figurines of little-known deities. \u201cThere is an entire hidden layer, earlier ruins beneath the settlement that aren\u2019t visible because we covered them again with earth,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Pandermalis said some of the treasures will also be on show in the exhibition space. A Roman-era copy of an original fourth century BC marble bust of Aristotle is likely to have pride of place when the artefacts go on display next year.</p> <p>With its aquiline nose, protruding forehead and minute eyes and mouth, the bust is considered one of the best likenesses of the Greek philosopher. \u201cHe is well-groomed and well dressed,\u201d smiled Pandermalis, saying the piece had been discovered by chance amid the debris of an archaeological trench.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the image of a man who took great care of himself and that is fitting as we know, unlike other philosophers, Aristotle did indeed care about such things.\u201d</p>",

One of the biggest excavations within the walls of ancient Athens helped archaeologists learn more than any previous dig had about the birthplace of democracy. \u201cIt was complex because there were so many layers, so many dwellings, one on top of the other, all telling the history of Athens,\u201d said Stamatia Eleftheratou, who headed the excavation work. The ancient settlement covers 4,000 square metres, accessed by steel walkways. But Eleftheratou and her team worked over an area three times that size, discovering close to 50,000 artefacts, including figurines of little-known deities. \u201cThere is an entire hidden layer, earlier ruins beneath the settlement that aren\u2019t visible because we covered them again with earth,\u201d she said. Pandermalis said some of the treasures will also be on show in the exhibition space. A Roman-era copy of an original fourth century BC marble bust of Aristotle is likely to have pride of place when the artefacts go on display next year. With its aquiline nose, protruding forehead and minute eyes and mouth, the bust is considered one of the best likenesses of the Greek philosopher. \u201cHe is well-groomed and well dressed,\u201d smiled Pandermalis, saying the piece had been discovered by chance amid the debris of an archaeological trench. \u201cIt is the image of a man who took great care of himself and that is fitting as we know, unlike other philosophers, Aristotle did indeed care about such things.\u201d",

He said: \u201cWhat we can\u2019t have is this paralysing uncertainty, bad for the economy, bad for trust in democracy, bad for the Conservatives \u2013 as we are seeing \u2013 of just going on and on with this prolonged torture of haggling with the EU when we haven\u2019t got a deal in sight.\u201d The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said on Thursday that it was \u201cblindingly obvious\u201d the new Conservative prime minister would not be able to suspend parliament to push through a no-deal Brexit. \u201cThat is simply not going to happen. It is just so blindingly obvious that it almost doesn\u2019t need to be stated, but apparently, it does and therefore I have done,\u201d he told MPs. Following Theresa May\u2019s formal resignation as Tory leader on Friday, the starting gun has been fired in the race to succeed her. The nomination process will take place on Monday, with candidates requiring eight MPs to back them in order to enter the race, with the first round of voting on Thursday.",

All these strands combine in one of the most unorthodox song cycles in the repertoire: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/leos-janacek\" title=\"\">Leo\u0161 Jan\u00e1\u010dek</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-diary-of-one-who-disappeared-by-ivo-van-hove\" title=\"\"><strong>The Diary of One Who Disappeared</strong></a> (1917-20). Consisting of nearly two dozen songs, some just snatches, each seething with erotic passion, it requires not only a tenor and pianist, but also \u2013 minimally \u2013 a mezzo-soprano and three additional female voices. It\u2019s a relative rarity in the concert hall, and a natural for dramatic treatment. Deborah Warner staged it at the National Theatre, in a translation by Seamus Heaney, in 1999. Now the omnipresent Belgian director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ivo-van-hove\" title=\"\">Ivo van Hove</a> has constructed an elaborate and coolly mysterious version with the Flemish company Muziektheater Transparant.</p> <p>As part of a world tour, three performances were given at the Royal Opera\u2019s Linbury theatre, with the British tenor Ed Lyon fierce and intense in the central role and Lada Vale\u0161ov\u00e1 as pianist/music director. New songs by the Belgian composer Annelies Van Parys were incorporated, nominally to give the perspective of the Roma girl, Zefka, sung by the French mezzo-soprano Marie Hamard. If they didn\u2019t add much, sitting discreetly and discretely within Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s untouchable sound world, nor did they disturb. The troubled emotions of the man, here a photographer inhabiting a darkroom-cum-elegant studio home, dominate. An actor, Wim van der Grijn, plays a figure who might be a father, or an older version of the young man, and in the end is clearly Jan\u00e1\u010dek himself, waiting in vain for the object of his infatuation, Kamila St\u00f6sslov\u00e1, to return his passion.</p> <p>Whatever it all meant, in its confusing but suggestive way it was beautifully conceived and performed. Jan Versweyveld\u2019s sinewy, detailed designs, referencing Antonioni\u2019s 1966 film <em>Blow-Up</em>, made exquisite use of dappled light. It\u2019s a pity no one corrected the many errors in the surtitles. For an intricate assessment of Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s painful relationship with St\u00f6sslov\u00e1, I strongly recommend Dennis Marks\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ef1XDi_rJq4\" title=\"\">BBC TV documentary</a> with the tenor Ian Bostridge.

The throat infection may have been to blame. Or had they been instructed not to touch each other when words and texts, admittedly working hard to remove the necessity, screamed sex and passion? The casting of Auty as the noble young hero, scaling his high notes admirably despite occasional dryness, and Stephen Richardson as the suave sugar daddy, Geronte, must have had a specific intention: the \u201cteenage\u201d Manon\u2019s relationship is not, here, a contrast between penniless youth and grey-haired wealth but between two men in various stages of middle age. Paul Carey Jones made the most of his strange portrayal as Manon\u2019s deceitful, self-interested brother, Lescaut. Or perhaps it\u2019s normal to want to wear your sister\u2019s turquoise-glitter pumps. It was a crude, outdated depiction of camp. Despite these reservations, the chance to hear Puccini\u2019s early masterpiece is always worthwhile, and Opera Holland Park, as always, does it with heart.</p> <p>If Manon is fickle, <a href=\"https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/2019/event/il-pomo-doro-with-joyce-didonato-handels-agrippina\" title=\"\"><strong>Agrippina</strong></a>, unloving wife of the Roman emperor Claudius, is pure poison.

      "bodyText": "Brecon Beacons, Wales In a great spot overlooking the Cefn Coed viaduct, halfway point on the 90km traffic-free Taff Trail, The Grange is a well-appointed guesthouse run by cycling fanatics Gethin and Nikki Pearson. The choice of local rides is immense: lonely mountain roads and bridleways crisscross the Brecon Beacons national park and include big-name road climbs, such as the Rhigos and the Tumble, as well as the Gap off-road route. The mountain bike trails of Bike Park Wales are a few minutes away, and a network of gravel tracks along the ridges above the valleys of the south Wales coalfield is ripe for exploration. The set-up is geared to looking after cyclists: Gethin and Nikki maintain a Strava library of recommended routes, there\u2019s a secure lock-up, bike workshop and pressure washer, they serve hearty home-cooked dinners and can arrange transfers and emergency pick-ups. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a385 B&amp;B, thegrangecefncoed.wales Nevis range, Scotland For Londoners, there\u2019s no better start to a Scottish cycling holiday than a night on the Caledonian sleeper, being rocked to sleep as the train trundles north, bike stowed in the guard\u2019s van. It arrives next morning in Fort William, at the end of the West Highland Way and the Great Glen cycling routes. The mountain biking possibilities are unlimited, from gentle family-friendly trails to cross-country marathons and the extreme downhill trails that featured in the UCI World Cup (1-2 June 2019). On the meadows and woodland of an organic farm at the foot of the Nevis range, but only four miles from the station, Great Glen Yurts is an outdoorsy alternative to a hotel or B&amp;B. The yurts, shepherd\u2019s huts and cabins are all cosy and have their own wood-burners, plus there\u2019s a rustic shared kitchen. Bike hire and route advice are available from Nevis Cycles. \u2022 Yurt for four from \u00a370 a night, shepherd\u2019s hut for two from \u00a360, greatglenyurts.com Snowdonia, Wales The 19th-century Romantics who flocked to Wales fell in love with the Mawddach estuary and its broad tidal reach ringed by craggy hills. The old railway line is now a traffic-free cycling and walking path, and just the beginning of the good cycling in this corner of southern Snowdonia. A short ride from Morfa Mawddach station, Graig Wen has rooms and self-catering cottages in a stylishly renovated former slate-cutting shed, plus yurts and a small campsite on a wide expanse of salt marsh, meadow, pasture and oak woodland. There\u2019s good mountain biking on the trails at nearby Coed y Brenin and plenty of quiet country lanes and gravel tracks on the flanks of Cadair Idris, in the Dovey valley and the hills around Bala. For dinner, the George III at Penmaenpool is an easy ride along the estuary, and further upstream is the handsome, granite town of Dolgellau. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a383 B&amp;B, Camping pitches from \u00a315, graigwen.co.uk Brittany, France The mountain passes of the Alps and Pyrenees get the limelight, but the true heartland of French cycling is Brittany, with its rolling hills and rugged coast. La Chaumine is a charming 18th-century farmhouse B&amp;B a few miles from the coast in the south of the region. It\u2019s a two-hour drive from St-Malo ferry port (a two- to three-day ride along waymarked cycle route 3) or an hour\u2019s drive from Nantes. The weather is generally better on this southern side of Brittany, and there\u2019s plenty of space to stretch out in gardens that provide the house with flowers, fruit and vegetables. Hire bikes are available, and there\u2019s a pool to cool off in at the end of the day. Steve, the British host, is an experienced cyclist who can give advice on roads to ride and the best beaches, towns and villages to visit. \u2022 Doubles from \u00a363 B&amp;B, lachaumine-marzan.com French Pyrenees Nick and Mireille, the Anglo-French couple who run B&amp;B Green Bike Pyrenees, are both accomplished cyclists with an encyclopaedic knowledge of routes and cycling events.

Only 15 miles from the TGV station at Pau, they offer transfers for guests with bikes and can provide good quality road and mountain bikes to rent from \u20ac20 a day.

More recently, Colombian guerrillas \u2013 dissidents from the now-demobilized <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/farc\">Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc)</a> and members of the National Liberation Army (ELN) \u2013 have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/30/venezuelans-say-colombian-rebels-to-blame-for-killing-spree-in-mining-zone\">expanded their reach</a> hundreds of miles into Venezuela.</p> <p>The groups are deeply entrenched in local communities, and often work in volatile alliances with parts of the military who privately profit from illegal mining.</p> <p>At least 300,000 people work at wildcat mines which have caused huge environmental damage, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/feb/21/venezuela-crisis-threatens-disease-epidemic-across-continent-experts\">sparked a malaria epidemic</a>.</p> <p>Confrontations between the rival armed groups make southern Venezuela one of the most violent regions in Latin America. \u201cEverybody wants to be boss,\u201d explained a former miner who fled to Colombia to avoid the escalating violence.</p> <p>Numerous sources confirm the army\u2019s participation in illicit mining and report that military death squads have occasionally entered mines to settle disputes. Most killings go unrecorded, but local media have reported more than a dozen massacres since 2016. Municipalities in the mining region cope with homicide far above that of Caracas, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/most-violent-cities-in-the-world-in-2018-2019-3#3-caracas-venezuela-had-9998-homicides-per-100000-residents-48\">the world\u2019s most violent capital city</a>.</p> <p>Of these factions, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/30/venezuelans-say-colombian-rebels-to-blame-for-killing-spree-in-mining-zone\">ELN is one of the most prominent</a>, operating in 13 of Venezuela\u2019s 24 states and extending its reach across the southern mining regions to form a corridor across Venezuela to near its disputed border with Guyana.</p> <p>The ELN\u2019s tactical and ideological alignment with the Venezuelan government is grist to the mill for those arguing for a military intervention against Maduro.</p> <p>But any foreign incursion could potentially trigger a disastrous escalation of violence, possibly leading to a low-intensity conflict that would cause tremendous suffering for Venezuela\u2019s most vulnerable populations.</p> <p>The ELN is now Latin America\u2019s biggest guerrilla army, and has vowed to defend Maduro\u2019s government in the event of a foreign intervention.</p> <p>Local sources have described how the guerrillas embed themselves in local communities, giving political and military training.</p> <p>\u201cThey make [the locals] fall in love, offer them weapons and they indoctrinate them,\u201d said one indigenous leader from Bol\u00edvar state. As in Colombia, the rebels intervene in local disputes and offer a measure of authority in lawless areas \u2013 wildcat miners confirm that they prefer the presence of the guerrillas over the brutal and less tolerant Venezuelan crime syndicates.</p> <p>So what should be done? The freedom with which armed groups operate south of the Orinoco river reflects the weakness of the Venezuelan state.

Even the minerals that are sold by Venezuelan state companies and the Venezuelan central bank (BCV) stem in part from the same mines controlled by armed groups and should therefore be classified as conflict minerals.</p> <p>Forgotten parts of southern Venezuela are of key importance to the political future of the country. Communities abandoned by the state \u2013 and the armed groups that prey on them \u2013 merit more concern from international actors disputing Venezuela\u2019s future.

      "bodyText": "Late 2016, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro tweeted a photograph of himself with a smile on his face and a gleaming ingot in his hands \u2013 but not all that glitters is gold. Venezuela claims to possess some of the largest untapped gold and coltan reserves in the world, and the country\u2019s gold rush picked up when the president decreed the creation of a massive area of 112,000 sq km destined for mining, known as the Orinoco mining arc. In a recently published development plan Venezuela set the goal to produce more than 80,ooo kilos of gold a year by 2025. The project, launched in February 2016, was supposed to drive development, but many mining projects announced by the government have failed to materialize, and the mining arc seems now seems little more than a legal veneer for plunder by an expanding range of armed groups. Multiple non-state armed groups are spreading their hold over southern Venezuela, adding another unpredictable factor to the country\u2019s current crisis \u2013 and complicating any efforts for a peaceful resolution. Their methods and origins may be different, but their motivation is one which has driven violence in Latin America since colonial times: a hunger for gold and other valuable minerals. Venezuelan crime syndicates have run informal mines for years. More recently, Colombian guerrillas \u2013 dissidents from the now-demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) and members of the National Liberation Army (ELN) \u2013 have expanded their reach hundreds of miles into Venezuela. The groups are deeply entrenched in local communities, and often work in volatile alliances with parts of the military who privately profit from illegal mining. At least 300,000 people work at wildcat mines which have caused huge environmental damage, and sparked a malaria epidemic. Confrontations between the rival armed groups make southern Venezuela one of the most violent regions in Latin America. \u201cEverybody wants to be boss,\u201d explained a former miner who fled to Colombia to avoid the escalating violence. Numerous sources confirm the army\u2019s participation in illicit mining and report that military death squads have occasionally entered mines to settle disputes. Most killings go unrecorded, but local media have reported more than a dozen massacres since 2016. Municipalities in the mining region cope with homicide far above that of Caracas, the world\u2019s most violent capital city. Of these factions, the ELN is one of the most prominent, operating in 13 of Venezuela\u2019s 24 states and extending its reach across the southern mining regions to form a corridor across Venezuela to near its disputed border with Guyana. The ELN\u2019s tactical and ideological alignment with the Venezuelan government is grist to the mill for those arguing for a military intervention against Maduro. But any foreign incursion could potentially trigger a disastrous escalation of violence, possibly leading to a low-intensity conflict that would cause tremendous suffering for Venezuela\u2019s most vulnerable populations. The ELN is now Latin America\u2019s biggest guerrilla army, and has vowed to defend Maduro\u2019s government in the event of a foreign intervention. Local sources have described how the guerrillas embed themselves in local communities, giving political and military training. \u201cThey make [the locals] fall in love, offer them weapons and they indoctrinate them,\u201d said one indigenous leader from Bol\u00edvar state. As in Colombia, the rebels intervene in local disputes and offer a measure of authority in lawless areas \u2013 wildcat miners confirm that they prefer the presence of the guerrillas over the brutal and less tolerant Venezuelan crime syndicates. So what should be done? The freedom with which armed groups operate south of the Orinoco river reflects the weakness of the Venezuelan state. But threats of foreign military intervention will simply embolden the guerrillas and strengthen their ties to Caracas. Humanitarian aid is essential for the inhabitants of the region, but its safe entry will depend on the Venezuelan government\u2019s consent \u2013 and will not be served by the sort of forced entry attempted in February. The communities facing the most urgent humanitarian needs are remote and indigenous populations in the south, which are already suffering from epidemics and shortages. Food shortages are exacerbated by the dependence on gold as currency in mining towns. Outside actors should work to clean up Venezuelan mineral supply chains. Foreign states should enforce due diligence frameworks on mineral exporters and commodity exchanges to minimize risks that they buy minerals that finance conflict and human rights abuses. For now, the extraction of gold, coltan and other minerals funds armed groups and harms indigenous communities. Even the minerals that are sold by Venezuelan state companies and the Venezuelan central bank (BCV) stem in part from the same mines controlled by armed groups and should therefore be classified as conflict minerals. Forgotten parts of southern Venezuela are of key importance to the political future of the country. Communities abandoned by the state \u2013 and the armed groups that prey on them \u2013 merit more concern from international actors disputing Venezuela\u2019s future. Peace in Venezuela cannot be achieved without taking the south into account.

      "bodyText": "Puerto Ordaz was once Venezuela\u2019s industrial hub, a modernist dream of broad boulevards and ranks of factories and gateway to a belt of rich oilfields that funded government largesse for decades. As the economy has crumbled though, the modern city of steel and aluminium has been swallowed by its past, transformed into little more than an outpost of the gold mines a few hours\u2019 drive away in the fringes of the Amazon. There, in swampy, malaria-ridden pits controlled by criminal gangs, men labour away much as they would have done centuries ago. The lumps of yellow metal they extract through backbreaking work now power the city; gold has become so pervasive that medieval-style barter is replacing hard currency across the city. Gold also increasingly pays the bills for the national government in distant Caracas. With oil revenues dwindling and US sanctions biting, the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has been relying on wealth from the mines to keep the government afloat during a months-long standoff with the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3. So the government has allowed the illegal industry and the armed groups that run them to flourish, spawning an epidemic of violence, disease and environmental devastation, and drawing in much of the remaining population of Puerto Ordaz. \u201cMore than half our clients want to pay in gold,\u201d said one estate agent in Puerto Ordaz, who described a recent nerve-racking drive through the increasingly lawless city to broker a deal, following buyers carrying an apartment\u2019s worth of precious metal. \u201cThe client said \u2018come in our car\u2019, but I said: \u2018No, we are traveling behind you.\u2019 With the insecurity you don\u2019t know who knows you have gold,\u201d added the agent, who is still struggling with the new norms of doing business, and asked not to be named for her safety. Even the universities have been swept up in the gold rush. \u201cIn November, one of the girls who is studying here told me: \u2018A degree is not expensive, because its only 2.5g of gold [for a semester],\u2019\u201d said Arturo Peraza, rector of the city\u2019s influential Universidad Cat\u00f3lica Andr\u00e9s Bello. \u201cIt was the first time I learned the value of a university education in grams of gold. I could not have imagined it.\u201d Shopping malls have been taken over by metal dealers, who sit idly in rows of shops that once sold electronics or clothes, waiting for miners to arrive with crumbs of yellow to exchange for cash. Men with wary eyes and barely concealed guns stand near the main exits. They are the most discreet public face of an epidemic of violence nurtured in the mines, but already spilling beyond them. Gold fever has fuelled a proliferation of armed gangs, drawn in a Colombian guerrilla group, the ELN, fostered corruption in the national security forces, and insecurity in Puerto Ordaz. Disease has also festered in the mines then followed gold and miners to Puerto Ordaz, reviving malaria in a region where it was once stamped out. Troubles in the country\u2019s remote east usually make fewer headlines than crises along the western border with Colombia, the main route for millions of migrants trying to escape Venezuela\u2019s misery. But locals say the lawlessness brewing in the remote mining camps is an underestimated risk. \u201cHere in Bol\u00edvar state, we have the conditions to finance chaos, because we have gold,\u201d said Peraza. \u201cIn Caracas they don\u2019t know what is going on here. They are so focused on the question of oil, because its been the economic heart of the country for 100 years. But the oil has dried up and no one has realised how reality changed.\u201d Gold is far easier to transport, and less complex to extract, if you have a workforce desperate enough to do the dangerous, dirty work by hand. The men who dig for gold \u2013 and it is all men, women only work as cooks or in brothels at the mines \u2013 include professionals whose jobs were engulfed by the crisis or whose salaries have been eroded by hyperinflation to levels that will buy them a few loaves of bread, or perhaps a bag of rice. Some never return from the brutal pits, whatever deaths they met there not registered, their bodies never officially buried. Among the missing are photographer Wilmer Gonz\u00e1lez, who both chronicled the mines and worked in them. In the region, many who are not directly digging for gold are dependent on the gold economy to survive. Every day a steady stream of passenger cars head to the mines loaded with jerrycans of diesel, many driven by white-collar workers. \u201cI have no choice if we want to eat \u2013 I haven\u2019t been paid for months,\u201d said Lucia, a primary school teacher who twice a week makes the 18 hour round trip with her husband and two small children, risking malaria and violence for a small markup that will keep a roof over their heads, and the most basic of meals on the table. She asked not to use her real name for fear of losing her job. Once a supporter of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, she lost faith in the government as the economy collapsed around her once-prosperous family, destroying her husband\u2019s blue collar factory job and turning her teaching post into a voluntary one. \u201cThis has led us to do things we could never have imagined, selling cheese, dealing hard currency. Then when we didn\u2019t have any other way to make money we decided we had to sell diesel [to the mines],\u201d she said. The lure of the gold buried under the forests of eastern Venezuela is centuries old. Walter Raleigh sailed up the Orinoco river past the current-day site of Puerto Ordaz in search of the mythical El Dorado, city of gold, which was never found but lent its name to an undistinguished town on the road to Brazil. In recent decades, as Venezuela swam in the easy profits from oil, the gold mines seemed more like historic curiosity than going concern. The town of Callao, a regional hub and popular tourist spot, was known mostly for its carnival festivities.

      "bodyText": "\u201cIt\u2019s like being on Tinder but 100 times more awkward,\u201d explains Saschan, a single 26-year-old who is attempting to find someone to have and raise a child with her. This is an understatement. Pregnant and Platonic meets a handful of people who are, for a multitude of reasons, looking to explore \u201cco-parenting\u201d \u2013 that is, an agreement between two parties, romantically unconnected, who want to have a baby. There are 40,000 people currently signed up to co-parenting sites in the UK, which act as a sort of matchmaking service for wannabe parents. Like many of the people this film encounters, Desir\u00e9e, 32, is gay, and has always wanted to be a mother. She found Jamie, 24, on a co-parenting site. He is also gay, and always wanted to be a father. For all of the ills of the internet, there is something sweet and simple about its ability to connect different people on the basis of their shared needs, and allow happiness to flourish.

That\u2019s not to say I don\u2019t cook, but I want to spend the least possible time in the kitchen, so I can make the most of the long evenings outside with my family and friends. All routes point towards dishes that require little to no prep, which to my mind means either salads or bung-it-in-the-oven dishes, such as this pasta bake. It takes 15 minutes to put together, and uses good, flavourful, pre-prepared ingredients such as miso, sun-dried tomato paste and passata. As a bonus, it feeds a crowd, too. Baked pasta with miso, sweet potato and spinach Make sure that the non-dairy milk you use for the white sauce isn\u2019t sweetened. Prep 15 min Cook 1 hr 30 min Serves 6 750g sweet potato (ie, about 3), peeled and cut into 1cm-thick rounds Rapeseed oil Salt 1 x 680g bottle passata 150g sun-dried tomato paste \u00bd tsp kashmiri chilli powder 1 garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped 2 tbsp brown miso 750ml unsweetened non-dairy milk 5 tbsp cornflour 250g wholewheat lasagne sheets 250g young spinach 75g panko breadcrumbs Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas 7. Put the slices of sweet potato on a baking tray, add a tablespoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and toss to coat. Arrange on the tray in a single layer, then roast for 20 minutes, until just softening in the middle. Meanwhile, make the tomato sauce. Put the passata, sun-dried tomato paste, chilli powder, garlic and half a teaspoon of salt in a blender, then blitz smooth. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary. For the white sauce, heat the miso in a saucepan, slowly whisk in the milk, bring to a boil, then turn off the heat. Put the cornflour in a small bowl, stir in four tablespoons of the hot milk mixture to make a thin paste, then slowly whisk this back into the milk pan. Pop the pan back on a low heat for a few minutes, stirring until the sauce thickens to the consistency of custard, then season with a quarter-teaspoon of salt and turn off the heat. To build the lasagne, spread a ladleful of tomato sauce over the base of a 34cm roasting tray, then add a layer of lasagne sheets, followed by, in order, a third of the white sauce, half the spinach, half the sweet potato and half the tomato sauce. Top with another layer of lasagne sheets, then another third of the white sauce, followed by the remaining spinach, sweet potato and tomato sauce. Top with the last of the lasagne sheets and finish with final third of the white sauce. Scatter the breadcrumbs over the top and bake for 45-50 minutes, until the pasta is tender and the top bubbling and golden brown. Leave to rest for 10 minutes, then serve hot, perhaps with a green salad alongside.",

If I\u2019m to harvest potatoes and plant pumpkins, I need a plan of action, a multipronged, throw\u2011everything-at-it approach: chiropractor, shiatsu massage, if necessary, painkillers \u2013 and comfrey.</p> <p>Comfrey may not be an obvious choice, but it has always been such a kind plant to the garden that it should come as no surprise that is kind to the body, too. Once known as knitbone, <em>Symphytum officinale</em> has a long history of wound healing, particularly broken bones, torn muscles, sprains and aches. It was even applied internally, although many herbalists are cautious of using it this way because it contains powerful <a href=\"https://laborveritas.ch/en/articles/spotlight/pyrrolizidine-alkaloids/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMItqmvu-6z4gIV1IXVCh1hWA1aEAAYASAAEgLisPD_BwE\" title=\"\">pyrrolizidine alkaloids</a> that can cause liver damage and abdominal distress. However, only slight absorption occurs with external application. As such, a compress or poultice is considered more suitable for home use.</p> <p>Part of comfrey\u2019s magic is down to the presence of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allantoin\" title=\"\">allantoin</a>, a chemical that stimulates cell production and thus supports wound-healing. I have read that it was even used in the same way for plants: if a branch was damaged or a graft needed to be hurried along, a wrapping of comfrey was called for to do its wonders.</p> <p>Its other use, of course, is as a plant food. For every 1kg of leaves, you need 15 litres of water, but it doesn\u2019t need to be precise. Cut the leaves 5cm from the ground, fill a container, add the water and wait four weeks. Then use this liquid on any plant that needs nourishment: once a week for tomatoes, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jan/20/how-to-grow-chilli\" title=\"\">chillies</a>, aubergines, cucumbers, and other fruit in pots once the flowers appear; every other week for other crops in pots and whenever anything in the ground needs a little boost. The leaves are rich in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous because comfrey\u2019s extensive tap root can mine all the good stuff deep in the soil.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/01/alys-fowler-scented-foliage-gardens\">The best scented flowers and foliage | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Its vigour means it will self-seed with abandon. However, the variety Bocking 14 has been bred to have a higher nutrient content than wild comfrey and produces little seed, so it won\u2019t spread around.</p> <p>Those deep roots mean it is a pain to remove, so make sure you site it well. A mature plant will grow to at least a metre tall and the same again in width. You will need at least two plants, approximately 60cm apart. It does best in part shade, and mulching with grass clippings, compost or manure will mean a greater show of leaves.</p>",

      "bodyText": "My back is a little broken. I blame it on a bag of compost, although my chiropractor blames it on all the tapping I do at the computer. If I\u2019m to harvest potatoes and plant pumpkins, I need a plan of action, a multipronged, throw\u2011everything-at-it approach: chiropractor, shiatsu massage, if necessary, painkillers \u2013 and comfrey. Comfrey may not be an obvious choice, but it has always been such a kind plant to the garden that it should come as no surprise that is kind to the body, too. Once known as knitbone, Symphytum officinale has a long history of wound healing, particularly broken bones, torn muscles, sprains and aches. It was even applied internally, although many herbalists are cautious of using it this way because it contains powerful pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can cause liver damage and abdominal distress. However, only slight absorption occurs with external application. As such, a compress or poultice is considered more suitable for home use. Part of comfrey\u2019s magic is down to the presence of allantoin, a chemical that stimulates cell production and thus supports wound-healing. I have read that it was even used in the same way for plants: if a branch was damaged or a graft needed to be hurried along, a wrapping of comfrey was called for to do its wonders. Its other use, of course, is as a plant food. For every 1kg of leaves, you need 15 litres of water, but it doesn\u2019t need to be precise. Cut the leaves 5cm from the ground, fill a container, add the water and wait four weeks. Then use this liquid on any plant that needs nourishment: once a week for tomatoes, chillies, aubergines, cucumbers, and other fruit in pots once the flowers appear; every other week for other crops in pots and whenever anything in the ground needs a little boost. The leaves are rich in nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous because comfrey\u2019s extensive tap root can mine all the good stuff deep in the soil. Its vigour means it will self-seed with abandon. However, the variety Bocking 14 has been bred to have a higher nutrient content than wild comfrey and produces little seed, so it won\u2019t spread around. Those deep roots mean it is a pain to remove, so make sure you site it well. A mature plant will grow to at least a metre tall and the same again in width. You will need at least two plants, approximately 60cm apart. It does best in part shade, and mulching with grass clippings, compost or manure will mean a greater show of leaves.",

      "bodyText": "Jane Ross knows only too well how tough qualifying for the World Cup can be for a European nation and, as the striker recalls with obvious relief, Scotland\u2019s passage to France hinged on the finest of margins. Only finishing top of a five-team group confirmed safe passage. Finish second and the best four went into play-offs for the eighth available spot. That it was the 2017 European champions, the Netherlands, who scraped through to France in that manner makes Scotland\u2019s automatic qualification for their first World Cup all the more impressive. On the final day of qualifying, Scotland were neck and neck with Switzerland in Group 2, dropping points only against each other. The Swiss had a superior goal difference, leaving Scotland needing to score six more against Albania should they remain level on points. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t in our own hands,\u201d Ross says. \u201cIt was technically in Switzerland\u2019s hands. \u201cFor us players that were on the pitch in the game, we didn\u2019t realise the score in the Switzerland game. So it wasn\u2019t until the final whistle went and all the subs and staff ran on to the pitch celebrating that we realised that, OK, we\u2019ve qualified for the World Cup. \u201cWe were anticipating that we would likely have to go through a play-off. But to directly go through as group winners was an amazing feeling.\u201d The Scots put themselves ahead early on. Kim Little, the Arsenal midfielder, who cruelly missed out on Scotland\u2019s first Euros in 2017 with a cruciate ligament injury, struck inside nine minutes. Against the run of play, Doci caught the Scottish defence napping to level the qualifier on the stroke of half\u2011time. With Switzerland being held in Poland there was still hope. In the 68th minute, Ross headed in the winner from a free-kick. \u201cWe knew that we just had to win the game. And that was all we could control. We done that. And, yeah, as they say, the rest is history,\u201d she says. At 29, the striker, born on the Isle of Bute, is one of the more experienced Scottish players travelling to France. After 104 goals in 118 games with SWPL\u2019s dominant Glasgow City she joined the Swedish side Vittsj\u00f6, then spent three years at Manchester City before moving to West Ham, helping Matt Beard\u2019s side to a Wembley FA Cup final in their first WSL season. She is also one of the players who made the trip to the Netherlands in 2017, but a shoulder injury in their crushing 6-0 loss to England added her to the swollen list of sidelined players. \u201cWe were missing a number of key players,\u201d says Ross. \u201cBut the players that were selected to go were of a good enough standard. It could have been different had it been a full-strength squad, but it is what it is. For the players that were selected, we\u2019ve gained experience from being to a major tournament and being there. To now add the players that were missing to the squad then it\u2019s only going to be stronger.\u201d Seven members of the 23-player squad are part-time. They have benefited from Scottish government funding to be able to train full-time before the World Cup and Scottish women\u2019s football is heading in the right direction. With Hibernian and Glasgow City leading the way, the increased investment of Rangers and the professionalism of Celtic are signs of positive change. For that reason, Ross was not worried that their poor showing at the 2017 Euros could have been their first and last shot at a major tournament. \u201cFootball in Scotland is on the rise, for sure,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s more players now playing professionally and doing it full-time and that\u2019s upping the quality and upping the pool of players for the national team coach to select from, which is helping the game grow.\u201d A strong finish, after three losses between January and March, was almost scuppered by Jamaica\u2019s Khadija Shaw, who scored twice in front of a record crowd at Hampden, but Sophie Howard\u2019s second-half effort ensured a 3-2 victory for the home side. That victory came on the back of an impressive 1-0 defeat of Brazil, Little scoring the winner, in what Ross describes as a \u201cbig confidence boost\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a bit of a mix of results since we started playing our friendly matches at the beginning of the year. But every camp we\u2019ve been learning and growing. Shelley Kerr\u2019s changed up a bit and tried different players and different formations at times.\u201d When Scotland were drawn in Group D alongside England it almost felt a set-up: \u201cI had a feeling we were going to draw England,\u201d says Ross, but it has not put them off their mission. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three difficult matches, but the goal that we set is to get out of the group,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it comes down to tournament football anything can happen.

      "body": "<p>Richard J Williams begins his study in what was once one of the greatest trading cities on earth: Venice. He feels that, as someone who knows art history, he should relish the experience of walking around its architectural splendours. Instead he admits: \u201cI hate Venice\u201d \u2013 a city that clings to the image of gentle decay and aestheticised ruination that first attracted 18th-century tourists. Prevented from modernising by its heritage status, it is today defined by the circulation of tourists: \u201cThe true spectacle of the contemporary Venice is the tourist industry itself.\u201d</p> <p>In this slim and insightful book, Williams explores cities as the function of financial, social and political processes rather than as the result of \u201cdesign and intention\u201d. His focus is on the cities that aim to attract capital from across the world with glitzy shopping malls, bars, restaurants and galleries that feel disconcertingly similar from Beijing to New York.</p> <p>Williams believes too much attention is lavished on headline-grabbing skyscrapers, such as 432 Park Avenue, Manhattan (\u201ca place to park money, not people\u201d). Instead he takes us deep into the city\u2019s \u201cforest of signs\u201d in order to reveal \u201cthe city hidden in plain sight\u201d. In six fascinating chapters he examines the way in which money, work, political power, war, sexual behaviour and culture shape the appearance of cities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d54d9c01cdd82fecfdcafa97fe0a56203e94ba72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d54d9c01cdd82fecfdcafa97fe0a56203e94ba72/0_0_2048_2048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A place to mark money not people \u2026 432 Park Avenue, New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A place to mark money not people \u2026 432 Park Avenue, New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: dbox/CIM Group &amp; Macklowe Properties</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The chapter on work starts with the idea that \u201cthe evisceration of industry is one of the great defining processes of the global city\u201d. It moves on to Amsterdam\u2019s <em>broedplaatsen</em> (breeding places) \u2013 a groundbreaking scheme to seed creative startups in a disused shipyard \u2013 and concludes with Silicon Valley (\u201ca state of mind more than a city\u201d), referring to <em>Seinfeld</em> and <em>Sunset Boulevard</em> on the way. In the chapter on war, he describes how, as the era of total war segues into the war on terror, \u201ca city ostensibly at peace may in reality be violent\u201d. In the 1990s, Rio de Janeiro had a higher murder rate than the besieged city of Sarajevo. On sex, he notes that red light districts have often been subsumed by zones of sexual tolerance, \u201ckey signifiers of globality\u201d. From Manchester\u2019s Gay Village to S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Pride March, \u201cthe capacity of gay culture to generate urban spectacle \u2013 and the attendant capital flows \u2013 is certainly astonishing\u201d.</p> <p>In his conclusion \u2013 which feels like the polemical heart of the book and could be so much longer \u2013 Williams rightly observes that the future of urbanisation may well lie not in spectacular megacities with their soulless towers for the global superrich, but in medium-sized cities such as Leicester. Leicester is, he says, a city \u201cremarkable for its lack of spectacle\u201d. And in its \u201cmixture of grit and neon that flouts conventional good taste\u201d, he finds a visual richness and authenticity that is lacking in many urban areas that strive for global status: \u201cIt has built a life in spite of itself.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 To buy Why Cities Look the Way They Do </em><em>go to <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/why-cities-look-the-way-they-do-9780745691817.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">guardianbookshop.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

Instead he admits: \u201cI hate Venice\u201d \u2013 a city that clings to the image of gentle decay and aestheticised ruination that first attracted 18th-century tourists. Prevented from modernising by its heritage status, it is today defined by the circulation of tourists: \u201cThe true spectacle of the contemporary Venice is the tourist industry itself.\u201d In this slim and insightful book, Williams explores cities as the function of financial, social and political processes rather than as the result of \u201cdesign and intention\u201d. His focus is on the cities that aim to attract capital from across the world with glitzy shopping malls, bars, restaurants and galleries that feel disconcertingly similar from Beijing to New York. Williams believes too much attention is lavished on headline-grabbing skyscrapers, such as 432 Park Avenue, Manhattan (\u201ca place to park money, not people\u201d). Instead he takes us deep into the city\u2019s \u201cforest of signs\u201d in order to reveal \u201cthe city hidden in plain sight\u201d. In six fascinating chapters he examines the way in which money, work, political power, war, sexual behaviour and culture shape the appearance of cities. The chapter on work starts with the idea that \u201cthe evisceration of industry is one of the great defining processes of the global city\u201d. It moves on to Amsterdam\u2019s broedplaatsen (breeding places) \u2013 a groundbreaking scheme to seed creative startups in a disused shipyard \u2013 and concludes with Silicon Valley (\u201ca state of mind more than a city\u201d), referring to Seinfeld and Sunset Boulevard on the way. In the chapter on war, he describes how, as the era of total war segues into the war on terror, \u201ca city ostensibly at peace may in reality be violent\u201d. In the 1990s, Rio de Janeiro had a higher murder rate than the besieged city of Sarajevo. On sex, he notes that red light districts have often been subsumed by zones of sexual tolerance, \u201ckey signifiers of globality\u201d. From Manchester\u2019s Gay Village to S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s Pride March, \u201cthe capacity of gay culture to generate urban spectacle \u2013 and the attendant capital flows \u2013 is certainly astonishing\u201d. In his conclusion \u2013 which feels like the polemical heart of the book and could be so much longer \u2013 Williams rightly observes that the future of urbanisation may well lie not in spectacular megacities with their soulless towers for the global superrich, but in medium-sized cities such as Leicester. Leicester is, he says, a city \u201cremarkable for its lack of spectacle\u201d. And in its \u201cmixture of grit and neon that flouts conventional good taste\u201d, he finds a visual richness and authenticity that is lacking in many urban areas that strive for global status: \u201cIt has built a life in spite of itself.\u201d \u2022 To buy Why Cities Look the Way They Do go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

      "body": "<p>Few things bother Nell Freudenberger more than the way girls and women are still so often held back from studying science. For her new novel, <em>Lost and Wanted</em>, which follows Helen, an eminent theoretical physicist and single mother, as she mourns the death of her closest friend, Freudenberger set out to teach herself as much physics as she could. Growing up in New York City, she was, like so many other young women, encouraged to believe she didn\u2019t \u201chave the right kind of brain for it\u201d. After doing badly in a maths test in her teens, she was told by a teacher that she might as well quit, and by the time she reached Harvard, hoping to study medicine, she was so far behind that \u201cI couldn\u2019t even take a remedial math class\u201d.</p> <p>Abandoning the idea of medical school, she travelled in Asia after college, teaching English for a year in Thailand, and then found early success as a writer, publishing her first story in the New Yorker in her mid-20s after being discovered during an internship there. She hopes her own two children will keep going with maths, \u201cespecially my daughter\u201d, but fears they won\u2019t. \u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d she says of the new book, \u201cto see people on social media, especially women, saying: \u2018I\u2019d like to read this book but I\u2019m a little intimidated, it sounds like it might be hard.\u2019 Please give it a chance. It doesn\u2019t have to be my book; you can read any of the books in the acknowledgments, just read one and prove to yourself that you can understand it. Someone has told you you can\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>She notes that, unfortunately, it\u2019s not only in schools that people are hearing these harmful messages. Indignant, she mentions a lecture given <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/01/physics-was-built-by-men-cern-scientist-alessandro-strumia-remark-sparks-fury\" title=\"\">last year at C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/01/physics-was-built-by-men-cern-scientist-alessandro-strumia-remark-sparks-fury\" title=\"\">ern by Italian physicist Alessandro Strumia</a>, who said that physics was \u201cinvented and built by men, it\u2019s not by invitation\u201d, and claimed that women receive fewer citations in the field because differences in brain structure make them less capable of high level research (Strumia has since been suspended by Cern). \u201cIt seems almost like those arguments aren\u2019t worth answering \u2013 but apparently they need to be answered,\u201d says Freudenberger. For her own part, she found the process of researching the scientific concepts in <em>Lost and Wanted</em> \u201cthrilling\u201d, spending hours in conversation with physicists and reading papers on quantum entanglement. \u201cOne of the really beautiful things about the physics world,\u201d she says, is that all the literature is made available online for anyone to read, and she found that researchers were \u201cexceedingly warm and open and eager to explain their work\u201d. Such was her excitement that a friend who read an early draft of the novel had to gently tell her to cool it on the science.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Physics became 'another country', giving Freudenberger 'that heightened sense of experience that I get from travelling'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All three of Freudenberger\u2019s previous works of fiction, <em>Lucky Girls</em>, <em>The Dissident</em> and <em>The Newlyweds</em>, focus on cultures she did not grow up in, and for her, as she worked on <em>Lost and Wanted</em>, physics became \u201csort of another country\u201d, giving her \u201cthat heightened sense of experience that I get from travelling\u201d. After her early success in the New Yorker, Freudenberger\u2019s story collection <em>Lucky Girls</em> won the PEN/Malamud award, she received a Guggenheim fellowship and a Whiting award and appeared on the New Yorker\u2019s \u201c20 under 40\u201d list in 2010. This time around, she \u201cdid not start out to write a book about a physicist\u201d, and had first intended the novel to be \u201cmore personal\u201d \u2013 in an early abandoned version, the first-person narrator was a novelist: \u201cI should have known how boring that would be,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking!\u201d She found that she couldn\u2019t sustain her own interest when \u201ctrying to do something that\u2019s too close to home\u201d. \u201cI wanted to write a book about a woman who was passionate about her work,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the book was just sort of dead on the page.\u201d There was an astrophysicist in that draft, \u201ca minor character, and he was male, like the only astrophysicists I had ever known\u201d. Then it occurred to her that she could rewrite it, giving her protagonist a new profession.</p> <p>When Freudenberger\u2019s publishers initially asked her, \u201cDid you intend to write somebody who was so cold?\u201d she replied: \u201cI was just trying to write about myself!\u201d More seriously, she talks about wanting to explore a narrator who \u201ckeeps secrets from herself. I was thinking about Chang-Rae Lee\u2019s <em>A Gesture Life</em> or Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/06/kazuo-ishiguro-the-remains-of-the-day-guardian-book-club\" title=\"\">The Remains of the Day</a></em><em> \u2013 </em>of someone<em> </em>who has a real distance between what they\u2019re thinking and what they\u2019re feeling, their feelings are not always clear to them.\u201d Not that she espouses the notion that scientists see the world differently from nonscientists in any fundamental way. When she asked one physicist whether there was something in daily life that he thinks about differently because he\u2019s a physicist, he eventually said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not afraid when I\u2019m on a plane, because I know exactly how planes work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85fc7f1feb50716e423c027a05fd1bd6af5820c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85fc7f1feb50716e423c027a05fd1bd6af5820c9/0_118_2721_1633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emotional distance \u2026 Anthony Hopkins in the film adaptation of The Remains of the Day, a novel that inspired Freudenberger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emotional distance \u2026 Anthony Hopkins in the film adaptation of The Remains of the Day, a novel that inspired Freudenberger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Lost and Wanted</em> is divided into sections titled \u201cEntanglement\u201d, \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201cUncertainty\u201d, but Freudenberger was aware of the dangers of misusing scientific metaphor, knowing that a person like her protagonist \u201cwould disdain the lazy use of the uncertainty principle \u2013 novelists and playwrights love the uncertainty principle.\u201d Nonetheless, she says, \u201cthe concepts just seemed to go with what was happening emotionally for the characters: entanglement is such a beautiful metaphor for friendship, and the collision of two black holes and the gravitational waves that emanate from them is so much like what happens with grief.\u201d Her approach changed after a conversation with a physicist who was using figurative language to explain something to her about black holes, and who gave her something like a \u201cpermission slip\u201d for metaphor. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know, our three-dimensional brains are not equipped to understand these things without analogies \u2013 you just have to make sure that the analogies are the right ones.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The emotional centre of the novel is grief, and while revising the book, Freudenberger lost a close friend, the composer Michael Friedman, who died unexpectedly in his early 40s and to whom the novel is dedicated. She compares the initial shock of losing someone to the feeling she had after childbirth: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that there were people just going about their regular business. I thought I must be a different type of creature, like I didn\u2019t really feel human any more. You just feel so separate from anybody else who hasn\u2019t had the exact same experience.\u201d</p> <p>In one memorable scene Helen goes to the Harvard office of a professor, whose inappropriate advances towards her late friend Charlie had ended her promising academic career years before. The professor is suave and engaged, discussing the finer points of Helen\u2019s book on black holes, giving her his insights on Rousseau, modernity, love and moral ambiguity. It takes him a short while to figure out her connection to his former student.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/apr/07/bethann-mclaughlin-sexual-harassment-in-science\">BethAnn McLaughlin: \u2018Too many women in science have to run the gauntlet of abuse and leave\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Freudenberger, though she \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t set out to write something that had to do with #<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">MeToo</a>\u201d, was interested in how common it is for people to \u201cdescribe their lives being completely derailed\u201d by small, subtle interactions.

She gives her professor character arguments taken from Pankaj Mishra\u2019s <em>Age of Anger,</em> though, she says: \u201cI hate to borrow from somebody who I really admire personally and intellectually and give some of their ideas to a nefarious character. But I wanted him to be intellectually appealing in the way that professors are, to be able to make his case.\u201d</p> <p>The argument made so often by creepy professors to justify crossing the line with their students \u2013 \u201cbut literature is about love, teaching is about seduction\u201d \u2013 strikes her as important to address. We all fall in love with professors, male or female, regardless of sexual preference, she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really have to do with that. You fall in love with someone\u2019s mind. And professors have to figure out how to behave with their students.\u201d </p> <p>So many different obstacles can scotch a woman\u2019s academic career, whether in the arts or the sciences. Freudenberger experienced sexism early in her own trajectory, all the small indignities and public underminings that came along with her first lucky break: \u201chaving my picture taken, having articles written about whether I was just having the story published because my picture looked nice, because I was 26\u201d.

      "body": "<p>On a blustery Saturday morning, I am about to climb Alpe d\u2019Huez near Grenoble. I have waited years for the chance. For followers of the Tour de France, this is hallowed asphalt \u2013 a mountainous ribbon of road where mortals have pedalled into legend. The race I have entered finishes at the summit. My thighs already crackle with heat when the going gets steep.</p> <p>After 21 hairpin bends, eight miles and a final sprint against a Dane called Arne, I cross the line in 44th place. As I slump over my handlebars, my beard dispensing sweat like a full sponge, I receive a text message: \u201cCan you come and do this nappy?\u201d I get off my bike, turn off my iPad and hobble downstairs. Perhaps Arne is doing the same.</p> <p>The next morning, I am transported to New York, where I take part in a spinning class alongside hundreds of other masochists. Robin Arz\u00f3n, the instructor, leads a brutal interval class of sprints separated by \u201cactive recovery\u201d. Each pedal stroke is matched to the beat of the music.

But for the past few weeks I have been riding alone, holed up in a steamy spare room.</p> <p>The temporary cycling gym I have created is my route into a fitness boom led by two startups that are trying to change the way we work out. Peloton sells smart, connected exercise bikes, to which it streams spinning classes from its Manhattan studio; Arz\u00f3n is one of its most popular instructors. The bikes launched in the US in 2014 and <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/peloton-uk-launch-spinning\" title=\"\">the company arrived in Britain last </a><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/peloton-uk-launch-spinning\" title=\"\">autumn</a> with a seemingly bottomless marketing budget and endorsements from celebrities including the Obamas and David Beckham.</p> <p>Peloton\u2019s bikes, which have big touchscreens, cost \u00a31,990, on top of which riders pay \u00a339 a month to access the classes. (An app-based subscription that isn\u2019t compatible with the bike is \u00a319.49 a month.) Calling itself the \u201cNetflix of fitness\u201d, it has doubled its membership in the past year to more than 1 million people. Subscribers can join live classes or choose from a growing on-demand library. A London studio is due to open in Covent Garden next year, and the company is poised to float on the New York stock exchange. Its most recent round of fundraising <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/technology/pelotons-new-infusion-made-it-a-4-billion-company-in-6-years.html\" title=\"\">valued it at </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/technology/pelotons-new-infusion-made-it-a-4-billion-company-in-6-years.html\" title=\"\">$4bn</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/technology/pelotons-new-infusion-made-it-a-4-billion-company-in-6-years.html\" title=\"\"> (\u00a33.2bn)</a>.</p> <p>To climb Alpe d\u2019Huez, I used Zwift, which also has more than 1 million subscribers. If Peloton brings the spin class home, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/06/virtual-world-cycle-training-haute-route-rockies-zwift\" title=\"\">Zwift brings the road</a>. Also launched in 2014, it is essentially a computer game that turns a bike into the controller. I bolt my road bike to a compatible \u201cturbo trainer\u201d. These heavy machines, which start at about \u00a3250 and can cost more than \u00a31,100, pair wirelessly with a laptop or a tablet and apply resistance to a bike\u2019s back wheel or its chain. There is no steering, but the resistance varies automatically to mimic what I am doing in the game. When I ride uphill, it gets harder; when I enter the slipstream of the cyclist ahead, it gets a bit easier.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"415cb66f52b053296a812c65e9d40404a77257fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/415cb66f52b053296a812c65e9d40404a77257fc/0_2730_5615_5344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model virtual cycling with Peloton at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"952\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A model on a Peloton bike. \u2018With a busy job and a toddler, it is hard to find time to maintain a bike, never mind ride it\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the game, which costs \u00a312.99 a month, I can choose to enter a live race, tackle a structured training session or ride around various city-based race circuits recreated for the game. The Alpe d\u2019Huez replica is part of Watopia, an otherwise fictional island paradise of roads set among jungles and volcanoes that dispenses with such inconveniences as potholes, cars or rain.</p> <p>The brands are benefiting from a reversal in the supposed cycling boom. In April, <a href=\"https://www.sportengland.org/news-and-features/news/2019/april/11/record-numbers-of-people-in-england-are-getting-active/\" title=\"\">Sport England revealed a significant drop in the number of people cycling</a> for sport, leisure and commuting \u2013 and a spike in indoor riding. <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/decline-outdoor-cycling-rise-indoor-cycling-makes-uneasy-reading-says-british-cycling-419733\" title=\"\">British Cycling, the sport\u2019s governing body, </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/decline-outdoor-cycling-rise-indoor-cycling-makes-uneasy-reading-says-british-cycling-419733\" title=\"\">blamed </a><a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/decline-outdoor-cycling-rise-indoor-cycling-makes-uneasy-reading-says-british-cycling-419733\" title=\"\">potholes, pollution and death by lorry</a> for putting off even some of the most dedicated riders.</p> <p>Both apps use elements of social media. Peloton has a live leaderboard for each class and the instructors can see who is in each ride. Sometimes they congratulate members for a 100th class, say, or a birthday. When I first tune in and the instructor Ally Love asks: \u201cAre you ready?!\u201d I have a moment\u2019s panic, thinking that she can see me in my dodgy Lycra.</p> <p>Zwift allows riders\u2019 avatars to wave at each other and supports instant messaging. As I mingle with hundreds of other virtual cyclists, it is hard not to imagine each real person, grimacing and perspiring like me, in a basement or garage somewhere. Both services sync with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jun/16/james-quarles-strava-fitness-app-social-network-interview\" title=\"\">fitness-sharing apps such as Strava</a>, allowing members to post their rides more widely. Strava lays Zwift\u2019s virtual routes over real maps; zoom out of a Watopia ride and you discover the fantasy land has been built on Teanu, in the Solomon Islands. In reality, it has no roads.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Historically, indoor cycling has been a dismal experience. The abandoned exercise bike turned clothes horse is a symbol of fitness at its least motivating. Mechanical turbo trainers, through which resistance is controlled by a lever attached to the handlebars, have long been an alternative. While training for events, I have resorted to using one, motivated by nothing more than a stopwatch. It is irredeemably boring, but with a busy job and a toddler, it is hard to find the time to keep my bike maintained, never mind to ride it.</p> <p>Eric Min had the same problem. The Korea-born entrepreneur grew up in New York, where he rode laps of Central Park, just 10 minutes from his apartment. But then he moved to London to start a software company. The city\u2019s popular cycling parks \u2013 Regent\u2019s and Richmond \u2013 were a good 30 minutes away. Then came kids. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started riding indoors,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Min used a basic turbo trainer and tried cycling fitness DVDs, but they required a giant leap of imagination to be distracting. Each session was threatening his love of the sport. \u201cAnd none of them had the social interaction that I craved,\u201d he says. This led him to create Zwift.</p> <p>Min, who believes gaming can get kids more active, offers free subscriptions to under-16s (parents have to sign a consent form). \u201cLet\u2019s use the very thing that\u2019s keeping them inactive to become active,\u201d he says. Among his biggest young fans is Ben Wiggins, 15, the son of Bradley. \u201cHe comes home from school and, rather than go and play Fortnite until 3am, he goes on Zwift,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cyclingweekly.com/news/latest-news/sir-bradley-wiggins-son-comes-home-school-gets-zwift-instead-fortnite-405736\" title=\"\">Wiggins said earlier this year</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, because he doesn\u2019t have to go out in the dark,\u201d Wiggins added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f8040039daea388332f622faec65295aa5f7f886\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8040039daea388332f622faec65295aa5f7f886/0_1803_5661_6163/919.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Usborne virtual cycling with Peloton at home\" width=\"919\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I imagine each real cyclist, grimacing and perspiring like me, in a basement or garage somewhere\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Min has big ambitions for Zwift beyond its safety, convenience and appeal to gamers. As the virtual world has grown, riders have arranged to meet online and race. There is now a busy schedule of races organised by the community. One Saturday, between child-rearing duties, I enter the DIRT DADurday Chase Race for fathers. \u201cMy two-year-old only wakes up early when I\u2019m waaaay down in the basement Zwifting,\u201d one dad says on the chat thread during the warmup. The race, on Watopia, starts at a blistering pace; I hang on to the lead group for only 10 minutes.</p> <p>Now, Zwift is taking virtual racing professional. In December, <a href=\"https://zwift.com/news/10822-kiss-super-league/\" title=\"\">the company launched the K</a><a href=\"https://zwift.com/news/10822-kiss-super-league/\" title=\"\">iss Super League, its first </a><a href=\"https://zwift.com/news/10822-kiss-super-league/\" title=\"\">competition for riders from </a><a href=\"https://zwift.com/news/10822-kiss-super-league/\" title=\"\">pro teams</a>, who race alongside amateur teams drawn from the strongest racers. At the end of March, <a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20190328-road-Rosamund-Bradbury-and-Cameron-Jeffers-win-maiden-eRacing-championship-titles-0\" title=\"\">British Cycling</a><a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20190328-road-Rosamund-Bradbury-and-Cameron-Jeffers-win-maiden-eRacing-championship-titles-0\" title=\"\"> hosted its first e</a><a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20190328-road-Rosamund-Bradbury-and-Cameron-Jeffers-win-maiden-eRacing-championship-titles-0\" title=\"\">-racing </a><a href=\"https://www.britishcycling.org.uk/road/article/20190328-road-Rosamund-Bradbury-and-Cameron-Jeffers-win-maiden-eRacing-championship-titles-0\" title=\"\">championships</a>, in London, which were broadcast live by BT Sport. The riders lined up on turbo trainers and the winner in each event took home a champion\u2019s jersey, as well as a virtual version to wear on Zwift (all riders in the game can earn rewards to customise their avatar, bike and kit).</p> <p>Zwift then staged a race at the Giro d\u2019Italia in May, after recreating one of the event\u2019s time-trial stages in Bologna; four pro riders raced the course at a special event in the city. Min is now in talks with the UCI, the world governing body, about a world championships event. He also hopes to take indoor racing to the Olympics. \u201cI think my answer to that idea is: \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d says Jonathan Rigby, British Cycling\u2019s commercial director.</p> <p>Ian Bibby, a pro rider with the Madison Genesis team, was among the finalists at the British Cycling championships, but missed out on the podium. As a schoolboy racer from Preston, he used to hate indoor training. \u201cI\u2019d try and watch TV, but then I\u2019d end up just sitting on the bike not pedalling,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing could take your mind off the boredom.\u201d He started using Zwift in 2016 and welcomed the escape from winter training. In 2017, he did all his training for a big race in Australia inside his house. \u201cThen I went out and won it,\u201d he says. \u201cNo way would I have done that a few years ago.\u201d</p> <p>Bibby also values the safety of riding inside. He recalls a message his mother sent him after she saw a live stream of one of his Zwift races. \u201cShe said it was the most fun she\u2019d ever had watching me, because she didn\u2019t have to worry about me crashing,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Rachael Elliott, a British amateur racer, is one of the strongest women on Zwift. She has ridden more than 30,000 miles in her house. But the social aspect of indoor riding appeals as much as her many victories. Last February, she suffered a stroke while training on Zwift. Other users noticed she had stopped and helped raise the alarm. \u201cI started getting dizzy during my warmup,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember getting off and lying on the floor thinking I was fainting, then reaching for my phone.\u201d</p> <p>Elliott spent a month in hospital, where doctors said anything could have triggered the stroke. Zwifters sent her an iPad and under-desk pedals so that she could start riding again on the ward. She still has reduced vision; she can ride outside only on the back of a tandem. Many Zwift riders have become friends in real life. \u201cIt really brought home how useful Zwift is as a community tool,\u201d she says. She also says safety comes into her thinking; a stroke on her bike outdoors could have been much worse.</p> <p>***</p> <p>John Foley, CEO of Peloton, is a big road cyclist, but when he was head of digital at Barnes and Noble, the US bookstore giant, life was busy. To stay fit, Foley, who is 48, would attend spinning classes, which have come to dominate gym schedules all over the world and spawned a network of dedicated studios.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Classes are insanely efficient. Within two minutes of leaving my desk, I can be on the bike choosing from 4,000 classes</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The motivation was there \u2013 good spin instructors are equal parts DJ, life coach and drill sergeant \u2013 but Foley, who was involved in launching Nook, a rival to Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-reader, saw a way to bring it home. \u201cI was helping disrupt the book world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had stores to sell the product, a software team and a hardware team in Asia, and relationships with content producers. I was in a spin class and thought: I could do the same here.\u201d </p> <p>I had always looked down my road cyclist\u2019s nose at spin classes, but while I have been amazed at how immersive Zwift is \u2013 I really was on that mountain \u2013 I have surprised myself by using my Peloton a lot more. Partly, it is comfort. I have a new dad\u2019s bad back and I can adjust the Peloton to a more sedate position than my roadbike allows with Zwift. But I have also sweated out my scepticism, because spin classes are insanely efficient. Within two minutes of leaving my desk, I can be on the bike choosing from more than 4,000 classes (I have done only a couple of live rides, which are roughly every hour; Foley says only 20% of rides are undertaken live).</p> <p>I sort the rides by duration first, tending to go for 30- or 45-minute options. You can also filter by music genre or instructor. In every ride, the instructor tells you roughly what resistance to apply to the pedals, via a red knob below the handlebars, and how fast to pedal. Both measurements show on my screen, along with the power I am producing, in watts, and my heart rate, via a chest-strap monitor. In an interval class, I have to spin fast and hard between breaks. \u201cClimbs\u201d involve longer, slower sessions of growing resistance. In Tabata rides, the recovery time is half that of the sprints. I have rarely felt closer to death than when doing 20-second all-out sprints with 10-second recoveries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f09c23115013deb46e3fe88718d49be9dd9cf416\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f09c23115013deb46e3fe88718d49be9dd9cf416/0_1970_5691_6128/929.jpg\" alt=\"Model virtual cycling with Peloton at home\" width=\"929\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018For reluctant or shy spinners, Peloton\u2019s privacy is appealing\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I know the instructors can\u2019t see me, but the illusion is striking. \u201cStay with me,\u201d Arz\u00f3n might say, or: \u201cPut it back on!\u201d It feels like she knows that I am wavering or have taken off some resistance. Meanwhile, the leaderboard ranks users elsewhere according to their power output, adding a sense of competition, but also encouraging the exchange of virtual high-fives.</p> <p>Some instructors have emerged as minor celebrities. Love and Arz\u00f3n, for example, have 385,000 Instagram followers between them. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/leannehainsby/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Leanne Hainsby</a> is one of two British instructors who joined the platform last November. She records Peloton rides at a temporary studio in east London. Next year she will join a bigger team at the Covent Garden site. \u201cBefore, I was teaching 50 people in a studio; now, I have the opportunity to inspire thousands,\u201d says Hainsby, a former backing dancer for Taylor Swift and One Direction. She had started leading spin classes as a sideline before Peloton took her on full-time. \u201cI get some lovely messages on Instagram about how my classes have helped people lose weight or get through something personal,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In its marketing, Peloton has take a premium route, with images of its bikes being used in improbably swish apartments by buff models. But the official Facebook users\u2019 group paints a different picture. In between complaints about buffering, there are daily accounts of dramatic weight loss and recovery from illness, typically from modest suburban homes. For reluctant, shy or snooty spinners, Peloton\u2019s privacy is appealing.</p> <p>The bikes are also easy to parody. In January, <a href=\"https://www.bicycling.com/culture/a26067688/peloton-twitter-parody/\" title=\"\">a Twitter user wrote captions</a> under some of Peloton\u2019s photos of bikes in fancy homes. \u201cI had my carpenter build a $9,000 finished wood riser for my Peloton bike in my glass-enclosed zen garden/home gym,\u201d one read. Elsewhere, Clare O\u2019Connor, a journalist and prospective Peloton buyer in New York, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemcneal/dad-against-peloton-bike\" title=\"\">shared an email from her father</a> in which he slammed the bike\u2019s high price; it went viral. \u201cI have heard of the Peloton, and have concluded that, like the use of cocaine, it\u2019s another way of God saying people have too much money,\u201d he wrote. In its defence, Peloton points out that it is competing with gym fees. (If you were to spread the cost of the bike and the classes over five years, it would work out at \u00a372 a month. A UK gym membership costs <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44766250\" title=\"\">an average of \u00a343 a month</a>.)</p> <p>***</p> <p>The rapid rise of Zwift and Peloton has startled the fitness industry. Established players are racing to catch up. Technogym, the Italian giant of gym equipment, has just announced a rival bike. Rowing studios are popping up as alternatives to spin studios, with the same potential for home streaming. Gyms are worried and will have to up their game, says David Minton, a fitness industry analyst at DB Leisure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81fc212055c8539d32f1162a43bca3c5470a6f89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81fc212055c8539d32f1162a43bca3c5470a6f89/0_2339_5792_5652/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Model virtual cycling with Peloton at home\" width=\"1000\" height=\"976\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In every ride, the instructor tells you roughly what resistance to apply to the pedals, and how fast to pedal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Brooks/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peloton has launched a treadmill in the US with a similar screen; it also streams yoga, stretch and weights classes. When we speak by phone, Foley admits that getting the rights to music has been tricky during the company\u2019s breakneck growth period. A few weeks later, several music publishers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/peloton-interactive-lawsuit/peloton-to-stop-using-songs-named-in-lawsuit-over-bike-workout-classes-idUSL1N21C1PH\" title=\"\">slap Peloton with a $150m lawsuit</a>, prompting it to remove thousands of classes. In a statement, the company called the suit \u201cunfortunate and disappointing\u201d and said it was in talks with the publishers concerned.</p> <p>Demand will fuel further technological advances. I suspect we will see Zwift-compatible simulators that allow steering, leaning, and simulate, say, the rumble of cobbles. Virtual reality may take the immersion further. But isn\u2019t it a bit depressing that a wholesome pursuit of such mechanical simplicity should be brought inside as a digital product?</p> <p>\u201cIt just means I don\u2019t go outside for the sake of it now,\u201d Min says while looking at a giant photo of the renowned Stelvio pass in Italy on the wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to go outside because I\u2019ve got the chance to ride something like this.\u201d His father, who is 85, rides almost every day on Zwift using an old, non-smart Schwinn exercise bike. \u201cHe still doesn\u2019t understand what my last business did, but he gets this one,\u201d Min says, smiling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/11/meet-jools-walker-the-blogger-powering-a-cycle-revolution\">Meet the blogger powering a cycle revolution</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I have done more than 50 activities on Peloton and Zwift.

      "bodyText": "On a blustery Saturday morning, I am about to climb Alpe d\u2019Huez near Grenoble. I have waited years for the chance. For followers of the Tour de France, this is hallowed asphalt \u2013 a mountainous ribbon of road where mortals have pedalled into legend. The race I have entered finishes at the summit. My thighs already crackle with heat when the going gets steep. After 21 hairpin bends, eight miles and a final sprint against a Dane called Arne, I cross the line in 44th place. As I slump over my handlebars, my beard dispensing sweat like a full sponge, I receive a text message: \u201cCan you come and do this nappy?\u201d I get off my bike, turn off my iPad and hobble downstairs. Perhaps Arne is doing the same. The next morning, I am transported to New York, where I take part in a spinning class alongside hundreds of other masochists. Robin Arz\u00f3n, the instructor, leads a brutal interval class of sprints separated by \u201cactive recovery\u201d. Each pedal stroke is matched to the beat of the music. As Britney Spears tells me, \u201cYou better work, bitch,\u201d Arz\u00f3n spits one of her catchphrases: \u201cI don\u2019t babysit on this bike\u2026 you gotta own this hustle!\u201d I have cycled seriously for almost 15 years, clocking up thousands of miles in and around south-east London, where I live, and on famous climbs in the Alps and beyond. My bike brings me freedom, fitness, friendship \u2013 and that wholesome cheek-glow that only follows outdoor exertion. But for the past few weeks I have been riding alone, holed up in a steamy spare room. The temporary cycling gym I have created is my route into a fitness boom led by two startups that are trying to change the way we work out. Peloton sells smart, connected exercise bikes, to which it streams spinning classes from its Manhattan studio; Arz\u00f3n is one of its most popular instructors. The bikes launched in the US in 2014 and the company arrived in Britain last autumn with a seemingly bottomless marketing budget and endorsements from celebrities including the Obamas and David Beckham. Peloton\u2019s bikes, which have big touchscreens, cost \u00a31,990, on top of which riders pay \u00a339 a month to access the classes. (An app-based subscription that isn\u2019t compatible with the bike is \u00a319.49 a month.) Calling itself the \u201cNetflix of fitness\u201d, it has doubled its membership in the past year to more than 1 million people. Subscribers can join live classes or choose from a growing on-demand library. A London studio is due to open in Covent Garden next year, and the company is poised to float on the New York stock exchange. Its most recent round of fundraising valued it at $4bn (\u00a33.2bn). To climb Alpe d\u2019Huez, I used Zwift, which also has more than 1 million subscribers. If Peloton brings the spin class home, Zwift brings the road. Also launched in 2014, it is essentially a computer game that turns a bike into the controller. I bolt my road bike to a compatible \u201cturbo trainer\u201d. These heavy machines, which start at about \u00a3250 and can cost more than \u00a31,100, pair wirelessly with a laptop or a tablet and apply resistance to a bike\u2019s back wheel or its chain. There is no steering, but the resistance varies automatically to mimic what I am doing in the game. When I ride uphill, it gets harder; when I enter the slipstream of the cyclist ahead, it gets a bit easier. In the game, which costs \u00a312.99 a month, I can choose to enter a live race, tackle a structured training session or ride around various city-based race circuits recreated for the game. The Alpe d\u2019Huez replica is part of Watopia, an otherwise fictional island paradise of roads set among jungles and volcanoes that dispenses with such inconveniences as potholes, cars or rain. The brands are benefiting from a reversal in the supposed cycling boom. In April, Sport England revealed a significant drop in the number of people cycling for sport, leisure and commuting \u2013 and a spike in indoor riding. British Cycling, the sport\u2019s governing body, blamed potholes, pollution and death by lorry for putting off even some of the most dedicated riders. Both apps use elements of social media. Peloton has a live leaderboard for each class and the instructors can see who is in each ride. Sometimes they congratulate members for a 100th class, say, or a birthday. When I first tune in and the instructor Ally Love asks: \u201cAre you ready?!\u201d I have a moment\u2019s panic, thinking that she can see me in my dodgy Lycra. Zwift allows riders\u2019 avatars to wave at each other and supports instant messaging. As I mingle with hundreds of other virtual cyclists, it is hard not to imagine each real person, grimacing and perspiring like me, in a basement or garage somewhere. Both services sync with fitness-sharing apps such as Strava, allowing members to post their rides more widely. Strava lays Zwift\u2019s virtual routes over real maps; zoom out of a Watopia ride and you discover the fantasy land has been built on Teanu, in the Solomon Islands. In reality, it has no roads. *** Historically, indoor cycling has been a dismal experience. The abandoned exercise bike turned clothes horse is a symbol of fitness at its least motivating. Mechanical turbo trainers, through which resistance is controlled by a lever attached to the handlebars, have long been an alternative. While training for events, I have resorted to using one, motivated by nothing more than a stopwatch. It is irredeemably boring, but with a busy job and a toddler, it is hard to find the time to keep my bike maintained, never mind to ride it. Eric Min had the same problem. The Korea-born entrepreneur grew up in New York, where he rode laps of Central Park, just 10 minutes from his apartment. But then he moved to London to start a software company. The city\u2019s popular cycling parks \u2013 Regent\u2019s and Richmond \u2013 were a good 30 minutes away. Then came kids. \u201cThat\u2019s when I started riding indoors,\u201d he says. Min used a basic turbo trainer and tried cycling fitness DVDs, but they required a giant leap of imagination to be distracting. Each session was threatening his love of the sport. \u201cAnd none of them had the social interaction that I craved,\u201d he says. This led him to create Zwift. Min, who believes gaming can get kids more active, offers free subscriptions to under-16s (parents have to sign a consent form). \u201cLet\u2019s use the very thing that\u2019s keeping them inactive to become active,\u201d he says. Among his biggest young fans is Ben Wiggins, 15, the son of Bradley. \u201cHe comes home from school and, rather than go and play Fortnite until 3am, he goes on Zwift,\u201d Wiggins said earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019re happy, because he doesn\u2019t have to go out in the dark,\u201d Wiggins added. Min has big ambitions for Zwift beyond its safety, convenience and appeal to gamers. As the virtual world has grown, riders have arranged to meet online and race. There is now a busy schedule of races organised by the community. One Saturday, between child-rearing duties, I enter the DIRT DADurday Chase Race for fathers. \u201cMy two-year-old only wakes up early when I\u2019m waaaay down in the basement Zwifting,\u201d one dad says on the chat thread during the warmup. The race, on Watopia, starts at a blistering pace; I hang on to the lead group for only 10 minutes. Now, Zwift is taking virtual racing professional. In December, the company launched the Kiss Super League, its first competition for riders from pro teams, who race alongside amateur teams drawn from the strongest racers. At the end of March, British Cycling hosted its first e-racing championships, in London, which were broadcast live by BT Sport. The riders lined up on turbo trainers and the winner in each event took home a champion\u2019s jersey, as well as a virtual version to wear on Zwift (all riders in the game can earn rewards to customise their avatar, bike and kit). Zwift then staged a race at the Giro d\u2019Italia in May, after recreating one of the event\u2019s time-trial stages in Bologna; four pro riders raced the course at a special event in the city. Min is now in talks with the UCI, the world governing body, about a world championships event. He also hopes to take indoor racing to the Olympics. \u201cI think my answer to that idea is: \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d says Jonathan Rigby, British Cycling\u2019s commercial director. Ian Bibby, a pro rider with the Madison Genesis team, was among the finalists at the British Cycling championships, but missed out on the podium. As a schoolboy racer from Preston, he used to hate indoor training. \u201cI\u2019d try and watch TV, but then I\u2019d end up just sitting on the bike not pedalling,\u201d he says. \u201cNothing could take your mind off the boredom.\u201d He started using Zwift in 2016 and welcomed the escape from winter training. In 2017, he did all his training for a big race in Australia inside his house. \u201cThen I went out and won it,\u201d he says. \u201cNo way would I have done that a few years ago.\u201d Bibby also values the safety of riding inside. He recalls a message his mother sent him after she saw a live stream of one of his Zwift races. \u201cShe said it was the most fun she\u2019d ever had watching me, because she didn\u2019t have to worry about me crashing,\u201d he says. Rachael Elliott, a British amateur racer, is one of the strongest women on Zwift. She has ridden more than 30,000 miles in her house. But the social aspect of indoor riding appeals as much as her many victories. Last February, she suffered a stroke while training on Zwift. Other users noticed she had stopped and helped raise the alarm. \u201cI started getting dizzy during my warmup,\u201d she says. \u201cI remember getting off and lying on the floor thinking I was fainting, then reaching for my phone.\u201d Elliott spent a month in hospital, where doctors said anything could have triggered the stroke. Zwifters sent her an iPad and under-desk pedals so that she could start riding again on the ward. She still has reduced vision; she can ride outside only on the back of a tandem. Many Zwift riders have become friends in real life. \u201cIt really brought home how useful Zwift is as a community tool,\u201d she says. She also says safety comes into her thinking; a stroke on her bike outdoors could have been much worse. *** John Foley, CEO of Peloton, is a big road cyclist, but when he was head of digital at Barnes and Noble, the US bookstore giant, life was busy. To stay fit, Foley, who is 48, would attend spinning classes, which have come to dominate gym schedules all over the world and spawned a network of dedicated studios. The motivation was there \u2013 good spin instructors are equal parts DJ, life coach and drill sergeant \u2013 but Foley, who was involved in launching Nook, a rival to Amazon\u2019s Kindle e-reader, saw a way to bring it home. \u201cI was helping disrupt the book world,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had stores to sell the product, a software team and a hardware team in Asia, and relationships with content producers. I was in a spin class and thought: I could do the same here.\u201d I had always looked down my road cyclist\u2019s nose at spin classes, but while I have been amazed at how immersive Zwift is \u2013 I really was on that mountain \u2013 I have surprised myself by using my Peloton a lot more. Partly, it is comfort. I have a new dad\u2019s bad back and I can adjust the Peloton to a more sedate position than my roadbike allows with Zwift. But I have also sweated out my scepticism, because spin classes are insanely efficient. Within two minutes of leaving my desk, I can be on the bike choosing from more than 4,000 classes (I have done only a couple of live rides, which are roughly every hour; Foley says only 20% of rides are undertaken live). I sort the rides by duration first, tending to go for 30- or 45-minute options. You can also filter by music genre or instructor. In every ride, the instructor tells you roughly what resistance to apply to the pedals, via a red knob below the handlebars, and how fast to pedal. Both measurements show on my screen, along with the power I am producing, in watts, and my heart rate, via a chest-strap monitor. In an interval class, I have to spin fast and hard between breaks. \u201cClimbs\u201d involve longer, slower sessions of growing resistance. In Tabata rides, the recovery time is half that of the sprints. I have rarely felt closer to death than when doing 20-second all-out sprints with 10-second recoveries. I know the instructors can\u2019t see me, but the illusion is striking. \u201cStay with me,\u201d Arz\u00f3n might say, or: \u201cPut it back on!\u201d It feels like she knows that I am wavering or have taken off some resistance. Meanwhile, the leaderboard ranks users elsewhere according to their power output, adding a sense of competition, but also encouraging the exchange of virtual high-fives. Some instructors have emerged as minor celebrities. Love and Arz\u00f3n, for example, have 385,000 Instagram followers between them. Leanne Hainsby is one of two British instructors who joined the platform last November. She records Peloton rides at a temporary studio in east London. Next year she will join a bigger team at the Covent Garden site. \u201cBefore, I was teaching 50 people in a studio; now, I have the opportunity to inspire thousands,\u201d says Hainsby, a former backing dancer for Taylor Swift and One Direction. She had started leading spin classes as a sideline before Peloton took her on full-time. \u201cI get some lovely messages on Instagram about how my classes have helped people lose weight or get through something personal,\u201d she says. In its marketing, Peloton has take a premium route, with images of its bikes being used in improbably swish apartments by buff models. But the official Facebook users\u2019 group paints a different picture. In between complaints about buffering, there are daily accounts of dramatic weight loss and recovery from illness, typically from modest suburban homes. For reluctant, shy or snooty spinners, Peloton\u2019s privacy is appealing. The bikes are also easy to parody. In January, a Twitter user wrote captions under some of Peloton\u2019s photos of bikes in fancy homes. \u201cI had my carpenter build a $9,000 finished wood riser for my Peloton bike in my glass-enclosed zen garden/home gym,\u201d one read. Elsewhere, Clare O\u2019Connor, a journalist and prospective Peloton buyer in New York, shared an email from her father in which he slammed the bike\u2019s high price; it went viral. \u201cI have heard of the Peloton, and have concluded that, like the use of cocaine, it\u2019s another way of God saying people have too much money,\u201d he wrote. In its defence, Peloton points out that it is competing with gym fees. (If you were to spread the cost of the bike and the classes over five years, it would work out at \u00a372 a month. A UK gym membership costs an average of \u00a343 a month.) *** The rapid rise of Zwift and Peloton has startled the fitness industry. Established players are racing to catch up. Technogym, the Italian giant of gym equipment, has just announced a rival bike. Rowing studios are popping up as alternatives to spin studios, with the same potential for home streaming. Gyms are worried and will have to up their game, says David Minton, a fitness industry analyst at DB Leisure. Peloton has launched a treadmill in the US with a similar screen; it also streams yoga, stretch and weights classes. When we speak by phone, Foley admits that getting the rights to music has been tricky during the company\u2019s breakneck growth period. A few weeks later, several music publishers slap Peloton with a $150m lawsuit, prompting it to remove thousands of classes. In a statement, the company called the suit \u201cunfortunate and disappointing\u201d and said it was in talks with the publishers concerned. Demand will fuel further technological advances. I suspect we will see Zwift-compatible simulators that allow steering, leaning, and simulate, say, the rumble of cobbles. Virtual reality may take the immersion further. But isn\u2019t it a bit depressing that a wholesome pursuit of such mechanical simplicity should be brought inside as a digital product? \u201cIt just means I don\u2019t go outside for the sake of it now,\u201d Min says while looking at a giant photo of the renowned Stelvio pass in Italy on the wall. \u201cI\u2019m going to go outside because I\u2019ve got the chance to ride something like this.\u201d His father, who is 85, rides almost every day on Zwift using an old, non-smart Schwinn exercise bike. \u201cHe still doesn\u2019t understand what my last business did, but he gets this one,\u201d Min says, smiling. I have done more than 50 activities on Peloton and Zwift. I have ridden more than 600 miles and burned tens of thousands of calories \u2013 losing about half a stone of dad bod \u2013 and sweated enough to flood a small village. I would never have exercised so much without the strange machines upstairs. Moreover, I have avoided losing the feeling in my toes to cold, or negotiating potholes or roundabouts or speeding cars. I have stopped inhaling bus exhaust fumes at traffic lights. But after two months of cycling in my spare room, my horizons are closing in. Soon, perhaps this weekend, I will have cleaned my bike, filled my bottles and picked out my favourite jersey. A morning chill will hold the promise of a sun-warmed back and I will wheel my bike outside and head for the hills with a friend. But if it is raining, or life allows me only 45 minutes... well, I will see you upstairs. Posed by models on location. Styling: Kara Kyne.

      "body": "<p>The black typewriter gives a satisfying \u201cclack\u201d when I hit its keys. The antiquated contraption sits on an upstairs windowsill in a house where there is a view on to a bay of graphite-coloured water that laps the shore. Above are tumbling slopes of bog cotton, bracken and foxgloves.</p> <p>In the late 1940s, Barnhill, a stout, white-washed house, on the Scottish island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides, was exactly what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/georgeorwell\">George Orwell</a> was looking for: a remote retreat unreachable by vehicle. He described it as \u201cin an extremely un-get-atable place\u201d; somewhere he could write what would be his final work \u2013 1984.</p> <p>It\u2019s as difficult to reach today as it was when Orwell made Barnhill his temporary home with his sister Avril, his housekeeper Susan and his young son Richard. The journey from the mainland involves two ferries (one from Kennacraig to Islay, then another to Jura), a 20-mile drive and then a four-mile walk along a dirt track.</p> <p>The island has one single-track road which winds and tapers down the eastern side. On my visit, the sun cast shafts of light over the \u201cPaps\u201d, a trio of scree-covered peaks in the middle of the southern half of the island. Red deer seemed utterly untroubled by my presence (they outnumber people 25 to one), and one russet-coloured stag ambled across the road ahead of me before slipping through thick hedgerows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf8d33366cae29582f32e8ded3b03682682bfd02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf8d33366cae29582f32e8ded3b03682682bfd02/0_0_2724_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Orwell at his typewriter in the mid 1940s.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"724\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Orwell at his typewriter in the mid 1940s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even on the sunniest days, there is a brooding, melancholic air to Jura. Swathes of the island are barely touched by man; the mossy corries, lumpy fields of peat, the occasional shadow of a golden eagle flying overhead, the crags, gullies and lochs all contribute to an atmosphere of glorious\u2013yet\u2013eerie emptiness.</p> <p>\u201cLife moves slowly here, even by Hebrides standards,\u201d says Rachael Jones, visitor centre manager at <a href=\"https://www.jurawhisky.com/en/\">Jura Distillery</a>, as we stand outside the entrance to the low, white-brick building whose chimneys dominate Craighouse, the main settlement. Tasting tours of the peaty Jura whiskies are one of the main draws for visitors, alongside trout fishing, deer-stalking and, of course, the landscape. But, as Rachael explains, true understanding of the island requires more than a daytrip from Islay to sip the malts.</p> <p>\u201cI came from Newcastle six years ago to live here with my then boyfriend, who is a local, and it has a charm that really gets under your skin\u201d, she says. </p> <p>\u201cEverybody does know everyone else\u2019s business on Jura \u2013 but it\u2019s a protective thing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all teach newcomers about the island and to be especially careful of Corryvreckan.\u201d</p> <p>Corryvreckan is a name that plays a small but vital part in the story of Orwell\u2019s time here. A whirlpool amid the coastal waters three miles north-west of Barnhill, it almost took the writer\u2019s life when his boat got sucked into it while on the water with his son. They lost the boat and had to swim to a remote cove. It was two hours before father and son were rescued by a passing lobster fisherman.</p> <p>The whirlpool was impossible to make out as the small motorboat I travelled on sailed north from Craighouse to visit Barnhill on waters as still as a boating lake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0488b102653da8c7236f0e683438a551167e2cec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0488b102653da8c7236f0e683438a551167e2cec/0_0_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Orwell came to Barnhill and Jura for the isolation, and it\u2019s still the same today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orwell came to Barnhill and Jura for the isolation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fletcher family, who have owned the house since before Orwell stayed there, only allow self-catering bookings for a minimum of a week. But since 2011 the <a href=\"https://orwellsocietyblog.wordpress.com/\">Orwell Society</a> has been running trips to Barnhill every two years, led by Orwell\u2019s son, Richard Blair, now 75 (the next is in 2020).</p> <p>A spacious, four-bedroom home, Barnhill, with its Aga, now-faded wall maps of post-war Europe, well-thumbed copies of 1984 and comfortably sagging armchairs, seems to have barely changed in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/how-george-orwell-wrote-nineteen-eighty-four-dorian-lynskey\">70-plus years since Orwell </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/how-george-orwell-wrote-nineteen-eighty-four-dorian-lynskey\">began writing </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/how-george-orwell-wrote-nineteen-eighty-four-dorian-lynskey\">1984</a>.

If you stay here, you\u2019re really treading in Orwell\u2019s footsteps. He would recognise the place instantly if he were to step through the door today.\u201d</p> <p>Orwell was battling tuberculosis during his stay on Jura and died seven months after 1984 was published, but Richard remembers his time on the island fondly.</p> <p>\u201cJura was a wonderful place to be a child\u201d, he recalls. \u201cBut this wasn\u2019t a holiday for us. Everything my Dad wrote and said indicates that he wanted to be here full time. For him, Jura was home.\u201d</p> <p>Climbing the creaking stairs that lead to his bedroom, it\u2019s easy to imagine hearing the clatter of the typewriter sounding out from this secluded spot, punching out the dialogue between Winston and Julia, and the concepts behind Big Brother and doublethink \u2013 words and ideas that, seven decades after it was published, are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/legacy-george-orwell-nineteen-eighty-four\">still being read and discussed the world over</a>.</p> <h2>Jura highlights by those who know and love the island</h2> <p><strong>Claire Fletcher, co-founder, <a href=\"https://www.lussagin.com/\">Lussa Distillery</a></strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"060f25859a17274e9f312368021a5a93dd643381\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/060f25859a17274e9f312368021a5a93dd643381/0_244_4274_2566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claire Fletcher (left) collecting sea lettuce, a botanical used in Lussa gin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claire Fletcher (left) collecting sea lettuce, a botanical used in Lussa gin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachel Keenan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><br>One of the best things about the island is the views you get from the top of the Jura Paps: a 360-degree view of the area.

As I work in the music industry, I put on live arts events and house one of the regular social events here \u2013 every Tuesday night. We all gather in Knockrome, where the old school is, and sing and dance through the evenings. We swap stories and tell jokes. Jura is one of the last wildernesses in the UK, unlike a trip to the Lake District or the Yorkshire Dales, you won\u2019t find a lot of managed walks.

      "bodyText": "The black typewriter gives a satisfying \u201cclack\u201d when I hit its keys. The antiquated contraption sits on an upstairs windowsill in a house where there is a view on to a bay of graphite-coloured water that laps the shore. Above are tumbling slopes of bog cotton, bracken and foxgloves. In the late 1940s, Barnhill, a stout, white-washed house, on the Scottish island of Jura in the Inner Hebrides, was exactly what George Orwell was looking for: a remote retreat unreachable by vehicle. He described it as \u201cin an extremely un-get-atable place\u201d; somewhere he could write what would be his final work \u2013 1984. It\u2019s as difficult to reach today as it was when Orwell made Barnhill his temporary home with his sister Avril, his housekeeper Susan and his young son Richard. The journey from the mainland involves two ferries (one from Kennacraig to Islay, then another to Jura), a 20-mile drive and then a four-mile walk along a dirt track. The island has one single-track road which winds and tapers down the eastern side. On my visit, the sun cast shafts of light over the \u201cPaps\u201d, a trio of scree-covered peaks in the middle of the southern half of the island. Red deer seemed utterly untroubled by my presence (they outnumber people 25 to one), and one russet-coloured stag ambled across the road ahead of me before slipping through thick hedgerows. Even on the sunniest days, there is a brooding, melancholic air to Jura. Swathes of the island are barely touched by man; the mossy corries, lumpy fields of peat, the occasional shadow of a golden eagle flying overhead, the crags, gullies and lochs all contribute to an atmosphere of glorious\u2013yet\u2013eerie emptiness. \u201cLife moves slowly here, even by Hebrides standards,\u201d says Rachael Jones, visitor centre manager at Jura Distillery, as we stand outside the entrance to the low, white-brick building whose chimneys dominate Craighouse, the main settlement. Tasting tours of the peaty Jura whiskies are one of the main draws for visitors, alongside trout fishing, deer-stalking and, of course, the landscape. But, as Rachael explains, true understanding of the island requires more than a daytrip from Islay to sip the malts. \u201cI came from Newcastle six years ago to live here with my then boyfriend, who is a local, and it has a charm that really gets under your skin\u201d, she says. \u201cEverybody does know everyone else\u2019s business on Jura \u2013 but it\u2019s a protective thing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all teach newcomers about the island and to be especially careful of Corryvreckan.\u201d Corryvreckan is a name that plays a small but vital part in the story of Orwell\u2019s time here. A whirlpool amid the coastal waters three miles north-west of Barnhill, it almost took the writer\u2019s life when his boat got sucked into it while on the water with his son. They lost the boat and had to swim to a remote cove. It was two hours before father and son were rescued by a passing lobster fisherman. The whirlpool was impossible to make out as the small motorboat I travelled on sailed north from Craighouse to visit Barnhill on waters as still as a boating lake. The Fletcher family, who have owned the house since before Orwell stayed there, only allow self-catering bookings for a minimum of a week. But since 2011 the Orwell Society has been running trips to Barnhill every two years, led by Orwell\u2019s son, Richard Blair, now 75 (the next is in 2020). A spacious, four-bedroom home, Barnhill, with its Aga, now-faded wall maps of post-war Europe, well-thumbed copies of 1984 and comfortably sagging armchairs, seems to have barely changed in the 70-plus years since Orwell began writing 1984. A generator supplies the electricity for light and there is a small gas-powered fridge. \u201cYou have to bring your own supplies if you want to stay here,\u201d says Damaris Fletcher, on hand to provide us with tea and cake, as our small group of Orwell Society members are allowed free reign to explore the home. \u201cIt\u2019s deliberate that we haven\u2019t changed much. If you stay here, you\u2019re really treading in Orwell\u2019s footsteps. He would recognise the place instantly if he were to step through the door today.\u201d Orwell was battling tuberculosis during his stay on Jura and died seven months after 1984 was published, but Richard remembers his time on the island fondly. \u201cJura was a wonderful place to be a child\u201d, he recalls. \u201cBut this wasn\u2019t a holiday for us. Everything my Dad wrote and said indicates that he wanted to be here full time. For him, Jura was home.\u201d Climbing the creaking stairs that lead to his bedroom, it\u2019s easy to imagine hearing the clatter of the typewriter sounding out from this secluded spot, punching out the dialogue between Winston and Julia, and the concepts behind Big Brother and doublethink \u2013 words and ideas that, seven decades after it was published, are still being read and discussed the world over. Jura highlights by those who know and love the island Claire Fletcher, co-founder, Lussa Distillery One of the best things about the island is the views you get from the top of the Jura Paps: a 360-degree view of the area. You get to see the raised features and caves \u2013 if you know where you\u2019re looking. Quite a bit of the island is uninhabited and there\u2019s a great sense of nature and freedom. I am one of the three women running the gin distillery here. We handpick the berries to make the gin from more than 15 botanical varieties. We\u2019re very small, producing only 11,000 bottles in two years, but people make an effort to come and see us and taste what we make. \u2022 Tours by arrangement Giles Perring, music producer and composer, Sound of Jura One of my favourite things is the sense of community we have here. As I work in the music industry, I put on live arts events and house one of the regular social events here \u2013 every Tuesday night. We all gather in Knockrome, where the old school is, and sing and dance through the evenings. We swap stories and tell jokes.

He said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see it barring him from this race in any way. I rather admire his honesty.\u201d</p> \n<p>Raab, who has previously admitted taking cannabis as a student, added: \u201cIt was a long time ago and pretty few and far between. I have never taken cocaine or any class-A drugs.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said class-A drugs were \u201ca bit different\u201d but added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to cast any further aspersions on Michael or anyone else who is just honest about being human and doing the things that some young people do \u2013 not everyone, obviously \u2013 and holding their hand up and saying: \u2018I got that wrong, move on.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Later on the same programme, Craig Oliver, who was ex-prime minister David Cameron\u2019s chief spin doctor, suggested the admission could become an issue that overshadows Gove\u2019s leadership campaign messages. The Tory rank and file were socially conservative, Oliver said, and \u201cit\u2019s not the norm for them to see people taking cocaine at parties and that kind of thing\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe problem I think he\u2019s going to face is that it becomes a big issue that he\u2019s going to have to face,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe next television or radio interview, there\u2019s going to be a bit more probing on what other drugs have you taken, what were the circumstances?</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m also not sure \u2013 although I do think that he\u2019s handling it right in terms of being as honest as possible about it \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that the line that \u2018I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to go into public life\u2019 is a great one. And \u2026 I would be advising him to change that and say: \u2018I was young and foolish I did a few foolish things, I regret that and I would like to move on.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked about Gove\u2019s admission, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cWell, he has decided to tell us what his past was like, that\u2019s his business.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if he believed mistakes in the past should disqualify potential leadership candidates, the Labour leader said: \u201cNo, I think people should tell us what they have done and move on in life. But I\u2019m unconcerned about Michael Gove\u2019s past life or behaviour to be quite honest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked whether he had taken drugs in the past, Corbyn said: \u201cNo, I\u2019ve led a very normal life in many ways.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Green party MP Caroline Lucas <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CarolineLucas/status/1137317396291772417\">tweeted</a>: \u201cRank hypocrisy of minister admitting to \u2018mistakes\u2019 on drug use while backing policies that perpetuate harm. From locking up disproportionate number of young, black men, to treating drug misuse as crime rather than health issue, prohibition fails us all.\u201d</p> \n<p>The environment secretary\u2019s declaration comes ahead of the publication of a book about him by the journalist Owen Bennett titled Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove has admitted to taking cocaine, joining fellow Tory leadership contenders in confessing to drug use. \u201cI took drugs on several occasions at social events more than 20 years ago,\u201d he told the Daily Mail. \u201cAt the time I was a young journalist. It was a mistake. I look back and I think, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that.\u201d The admission comes as Theresa May spends the final days of her premiership in Downing Street, with a number of the prime minister\u2019s Conservative colleagues vying to replace her. Gove, whom the bookmakers have as third in the race behind Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, insisted his past crimes should not be held against him in the leadership race. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that past mistakes disqualify you,\u201d Gove said. Speaking on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Saturday, Gove\u2019s leadership rival Dominic Raab said he did not believe the admission would have an impact on Gove\u2019s chances in the leadership race. He said: \u201cI certainly don\u2019t see it barring him from this race in any way. I rather admire his honesty.\u201d Raab, who has previously admitted taking cannabis as a student, added: \u201cIt was a long time ago and pretty few and far between. I have never taken cocaine or any class-A drugs.\u201d He said class-A drugs were \u201ca bit different\u201d but added: \u201cI\u2019m not going to cast any further aspersions on Michael or anyone else who is just honest about being human and doing the things that some young people do \u2013 not everyone, obviously \u2013 and holding their hand up and saying: \u2018I got that wrong, move on.\u2019\u201d Later on the same programme, Craig Oliver, who was ex-prime minister David Cameron\u2019s chief spin doctor, suggested the admission could become an issue that overshadows Gove\u2019s leadership campaign messages. The Tory rank and file were socially conservative, Oliver said, and \u201cit\u2019s not the norm for them to see people taking cocaine at parties and that kind of thing\u201d. \u201cThe problem I think he\u2019s going to face is that it becomes a big issue that he\u2019s going to have to face,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cThe next television or radio interview, there\u2019s going to be a bit more probing on what other drugs have you taken, what were the circumstances? \u201cI\u2019m also not sure \u2013 although I do think that he\u2019s handling it right in terms of being as honest as possible about it \u2013 I\u2019m not sure that the line that \u2018I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to go into public life\u2019 is a great one. And \u2026 I would be advising him to change that and say: \u2018I was young and foolish I did a few foolish things, I regret that and I would like to move on.\u2019\u201d Asked about Gove\u2019s admission, Jeremy Corbyn said: \u201cWell, he has decided to tell us what his past was like, that\u2019s his business.\u201d Asked if he believed mistakes in the past should disqualify potential leadership candidates, the Labour leader said: \u201cNo, I think people should tell us what they have done and move on in life. But I\u2019m unconcerned about Michael Gove\u2019s past life or behaviour to be quite honest.\u201d Asked whether he had taken drugs in the past, Corbyn said: \u201cNo, I\u2019ve led a very normal life in many ways.\u201d The Green party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: \u201cRank hypocrisy of minister admitting to \u2018mistakes\u2019 on drug use while backing policies that perpetuate harm. From locking up disproportionate number of young, black men, to treating drug misuse as crime rather than health issue, prohibition fails us all.\u201d The environment secretary\u2019s declaration comes ahead of the publication of a book about him by the journalist Owen Bennett titled Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry. According to the book, he admitted to having used cocaine to his advisers during the 2016 Tory leadership contest when they were putting him \u201cthrough his paces\u201d. An inside source reportedly said Gove replied: \u201cYes, cocaine,\u201d when he was asked if he had ever taken drugs. \u201cThe book is correct,\u201d the former justice secretary told the Daily Mail. \u201cI did take drugs. It is something I deeply regret. Drugs damage lives. They are dangerous and it was a mistake. \u201cObviously it will be for my colleagues in parliament and members of the Conservative party to decide now if I should be leader. I think all politicians have lives before politics. Certainly when I was working as a journalist I didn\u2019t imagine I would go into politics or public service. I didn\u2019t act with an eye to that.\u201d Gove joins a growing number of Conservative politicians to have discussed their various transgressions with drugs. Rory Stewart told the Telegraph last week that he had smoked opium in Iran at a wedding, but that his hosts, a poor family, had most likely put very little of the class A drug in the pipe and it had little effect upon him. The foreign secretary has also been asked whether he took drugs when he was younger. Hunt told the Times: \u201cI think I had a cannabis lassi when I went backpacking through India ... That is almost as naughty as wheat fields,\u201d he said, referring to May\u2019s confession when asked the naughtiest thing she ever did. In 2005, on Have I Got News For You, Johnson said: \u201cI think I was once given cocaine, but I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose. In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar.\u201d Years later, he confirmed that he snorted cocaine and smoked \u201cdope\u201d as a teenager. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019. Rory Stewart told the Telegraph last week that he had smoke opium in Iran, not in Afghanistan as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>It is the worst of times and the worst of times. Brighton, May 2017. I am bone-tired, shoving a buggy through jostling crowds. The sun is beating down. People are sitting in deck chairs, enjoying the first blast of early summer. But this is no ordinary Sunday on the seafront. Either side of me, two lines of polished parked cars \u2013 all Minis \u2013 stretch into the distance. There are Minis in every possible colour and style. Some are themed like cartoon characters or sporting heroes. Some have eyelashes. Some have stickers on the bonnet and furry seats inside. Hundreds of people walk \u2013 no, amble \u2013 in between, admiring the cars. The crowd flows one way. I am trapped. On I trudge, trying not to run over any feet, children, or dogs, trying not to make eye contact with the smiling faces, the shiny, happy people basking in the Mini Love.</p> <p>I had set out from my flat not knowing where I was going, just needing to walk, to get out, to put one foot in front of the other, to do something that felt vaguely autonomous. These walks are the only choice I have left. I slammed the door, cursed the lift that never arrives (No 1 Bane of My Life) crossed the road, crossed the perilous cycle path, cursed at a cyclist (Bane No 2) and turned left along the front. I stomped along the promenade, past the i360 viewing tower, past the seafood shacks and the smokehouse, the ice-cream stalls, past the pier, lit up and heaving, the crazy golf and the aquarium. Brighton is a place where people come for holidays, for hen dos and high jinks. It\u2019s a place of merriment and celebration. I am a dark cloud over it. My partner, The Cartoonist, actually said that to me this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s like living with a dark cloud.\u201d He has said kind things, too. He mostly says kind things. He is a man at the end of his rope.</p> <p>I know that I have not been easy to live with lately. My mind has been darkening steadily since December, a month or so after the baby was born. I have accumulated layer upon layer of bad feeling; of negativity, rage and doom. I am swollen with it, waiting to explode. \u201cI think you have postnatal depression,\u201d The Cartoonist says regularly. \u201cI think you should go and talk to someone. A therapist. Your GP.\u201d</p> <p>He is a GP two days a week, when he isn\u2019t being a cartoonist. Even though I got him to check all my moles the first time we were in bed together (apparently this happens to doctors a lot), I am refusing to accept his diagnosis on this. I don\u2019t feel depressed. I feel fucking furious. To make matters worse, in my hazy state of mind I have inadvertently stumbled into the midst of the London to Brighton Mini Run. It\u2019s an annual get-together for Mini owners. The smell of petrol hangs in the air. People have dolled up for the occasion. They smoke rollies and drink tinnies. There is a distinct festival vibe.</p> <p>I haven\u2019t had more than four hours of sleep in a row for seven months. I am jumpy and twitchy, like a person on high alert. I want to shout and scream and lie down and curl into a ball and have someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 just take the baby for a few hours and give me time to regroup. I feel like I am on the edge of a psychic fit; some uncontrollable outburst.</p> <p>The Cartoonist has told me he is worried I am \u201calmost psychotic\u201d more than once. But I have no options. My family are far away and I feel as if I should just be getting on with this. Surely not everyone can find it this hard or they just wouldn\u2019t do it, would they? So here I am, almost psychotic, surrounded by jolly mods and Minis \u2013 my least favourite car.</p> <p>The Cartoonist and I have a Mini. It is an old pigeon-coloured thing with one functioning door. The electrics are bust so the windows don\u2019t open. Pieces of upholstery and dashboard keep falling off inside. The Cartoonist and I argue every time we try and get into (or out of) it. The passenger door has been broken for two years but it will cost more to get it fixed than the car is worth. Getting a baby in and out is a gymnastic feat. I often end up literally on my arse in the street, baby held aloft, bags scattered. Travelling 300 miles to see either set of relatives, in Manchester and Wales respectively, is a logistical nightmare. The Cartoonist refuses to get rid of the Mini (he\u2019s had it for 10 years) and I see this as him digging his heels in, like some kind of eternal bachelor in denial about his new responsibilities. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How did this happen? I am tough, I am smart, I have built a career. Now I am cracking right down the middle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Mini convention feels like something sent from my subconscious to mock me, and I can\u2019t get out. It\u2019s like a bad dream. People must be wondering why I\u2019m charging ahead with such a thunderous look on my face. My phone vibrates in my pocket; I have it on silent so as not to wake the baby in the precious moments that he sleeps. I miss calls, but then people are calling less. My whole life has become one of shutting down, switching off, retreating into darkness. It\u2019s a text from The Cartoonist: Where are you?</p> <p>I text back. It\u2019s hard to type while walking and steering. He\u2019s worried, but I also want to vent at him. I am the master of angry texts, especially angry nocturnal texts when he is away (how come he gets to go away?).</p> <p>\u201cI am stuck in the middle of a Mini convention...\u201d</p> <p>I wait a moment, and then I launch my irresistible punchline.</p> <p>\u201cAnd I fucking hate Minis.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t rise to it, not today. I half expect him to. He\u2019d love it here. He\u2019d blend right in. Not like me, with my three-day-old clothes and scraped-up hair and foul demeanour. He texts back. I look, expecting some lengthy and passionate defence of his beloved Minis, but no. He says: I\u2019m going to get on my bike and meet you at the marina.</p> <p>I do not reply. I do not look for him on the cycle path. I stomp on. Everyone and everything is in my way. Sunday is in my way. Life is in my way. By the time I get to the marina I am a ball of rage, some kind of dying earthbound sun, a red giant on her way out. We buy burgers. As we sit down, where it is quieter, the baby wakes and looks at me. My heart pounds in my chest, as it does in the night, as it does any time he might need me. I pull out his bottle. The baby accepts the bottle and sucks on it. The knot in my chest \u2013 the constant knot \u2013 slackens off a little.</p> <p>I chomp on the burger joylessly, not tasting it, hawking and squeezing it down my dry throat. My love for food \u2013 like my love for most things \u2013 has mostly disappeared. I eat whole packs of biscuits, mindlessly, to stay awake in the afternoon. I shovel in jumbo bars of chocolate, barely chewing. Sugar is my fix \u2013 but also, I sense a self-destruction in these acts. Self-loathing, the like of which I have never known. A darkness that is deepening and widening, right through the centre of me.</p> <p>The Cartoonist watches me eat. I shake my head and scowl. I don\u2019t want to be watched. Don\u2019t want to be scrutinised. Leave me alone in my\u2026 My brain says it before I consciously allow it to. Misery. And there it is.</p> <p>Boom.</p> <p>I am miserable.</p> <p>And I know it.</p> <p>I start to cry. The Cartoonist nods and hugs me.</p> <p>\u201cI think I might be depressed,\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cYes. Will you go and see someone?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll go and see someone else for a potential diagnosis,\u201d I say.</p> <p>His face sort of crumples, but it\u2019s all I can give him right now. I am so ashamed. The floodgates have opened and I can\u2019t stop crying. How did this happen? I am tough. I am smart. I have built a career. I have lived alone. I have spent decades carving out a life for myself that feels fulfilling. Now I am cracking, right down the middle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11dfd99a7bb20018029a4e64057feaf482e24377\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11dfd99a7bb20018029a4e64057feaf482e24377/150_448_5449_3270/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Jane Unsworth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I remember the day I started loving my life again.

My son\u2019s birth was chaotic. I tore badly. I had an instant urge to protect him, but it wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d call bonding. The only thing I was bonding to was the wrong kind of maternity pad. Ouch. Breastfeeding was equally tough. I got mastitis, then thrush, and then my son got teeth \u2013 at 16 weeks. My hips hurt every night \u2013 sometimes so much I cried, maxed out on painkillers, unable to get comfortable. I was told it was \u201cnormal\u201d to have pain for \u201cabout a year\u201d after childbirth. Meanwhile, I was Whac-a-Moling a haemorrhoid every other day.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. The worst of it was the sleep deprivation. My son was a bad sleeper from the start. There are not even words to describe that level of tiredness. \u201cBone-tired\u201d is the closest I can get, but my bones felt like they had dissolved \u2013 along with my frontal lobe. I couldn\u2019t finish sentences. There is a reason sleep deprivation is used as torture. At night, in bed, I get flashes of bright white behind my eyes \u2013 bursts of adrenaline, I learn \u2013 the split second the baby starts crying.

My friend Lauren tells me, on a walk through a bluebell wood, that she had postnatal depression (PND) after the birth of her second child. It feels like a secret confession from one of the strongest, coolest women I know. I sense her shame, and I hate her shame. Lauren recommends a therapist who lives locally, a specialist in family issues. After the Mini convention I email the therapist, Kim.

Over the next few months, Kim helps me piece together a sense of what I\u2019m feeling. Why I\u2019m so angry. Why I hate everyone and everything. Why my previous positivity has shrunk to a black hole of despair and fury. Why I feel, for the first time in my life, like it would sometimes be easier to just be dead.

I suppose that\u2019s because women are ashamed of failing, and that\u2019s what it feels like (or it did to me) \u2013 and because it seems like a betrayal of your child, somehow. I was hesitant to write this article because I thought, what if my son sees it online in 10 years\u2019 time and gets upset, or thinks I didn\u2019t love him in the beginning?

Nothing prepares you for the onslaught and the exhaustion, mainly because we don\u2019t yet talk about motherhood honestly enough. We don\u2019t talk about the \u201cnormal\u201d brokenness nearly enough. I suppose a comparison could be bereavement, where it is arguably \u201cnormal\u201d to feel broken for a while after losing a loved one. But if that brokenness goes on, month after month, to a point where someone feels like they can\u2019t get their life back, then it needs to be addressed.</p> <p>There is no physical test for PND, but if you are struggling then please talk to your doctor. They will talk you through a test and offer help. You are not letting your baby down. You are not letting anyone down. You will feel empowered and informed, and will start to climb out of the hole, I promise. And the more we all talk about this, the more we all learn; it becomes less a thing to feel ashamed of, and more a thing that we can demand support for.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Childbirth and those first six months are so traumatic I think women should be screened like soldiers back from war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We are often told that depression is a clinical, chemical illness, separate from external factors, but I feel as though my PND was somewhere between the two: brought on by sleep-deprivation and feeling like I had to work.

      "bodyText": "It is the worst of times and the worst of times. Brighton, May 2017. I am bone-tired, shoving a buggy through jostling crowds. The sun is beating down. People are sitting in deck chairs, enjoying the first blast of early summer. But this is no ordinary Sunday on the seafront. Either side of me, two lines of polished parked cars \u2013 all Minis \u2013 stretch into the distance. There are Minis in every possible colour and style. Some are themed like cartoon characters or sporting heroes. Some have eyelashes. Some have stickers on the bonnet and furry seats inside. Hundreds of people walk \u2013 no, amble \u2013 in between, admiring the cars. The crowd flows one way. I am trapped. On I trudge, trying not to run over any feet, children, or dogs, trying not to make eye contact with the smiling faces, the shiny, happy people basking in the Mini Love. I had set out from my flat not knowing where I was going, just needing to walk, to get out, to put one foot in front of the other, to do something that felt vaguely autonomous. These walks are the only choice I have left. I slammed the door, cursed the lift that never arrives (No 1 Bane of My Life) crossed the road, crossed the perilous cycle path, cursed at a cyclist (Bane No 2) and turned left along the front. I stomped along the promenade, past the i360 viewing tower, past the seafood shacks and the smokehouse, the ice-cream stalls, past the pier, lit up and heaving, the crazy golf and the aquarium. Brighton is a place where people come for holidays, for hen dos and high jinks. It\u2019s a place of merriment and celebration. I am a dark cloud over it. My partner, The Cartoonist, actually said that to me this morning. \u201cIt\u2019s like living with a dark cloud.\u201d He has said kind things, too. He mostly says kind things. He is a man at the end of his rope. I know that I have not been easy to live with lately. My mind has been darkening steadily since December, a month or so after the baby was born. I have accumulated layer upon layer of bad feeling; of negativity, rage and doom. I am swollen with it, waiting to explode. \u201cI think you have postnatal depression,\u201d The Cartoonist says regularly. \u201cI think you should go and talk to someone. A therapist. Your GP.\u201d He is a GP two days a week, when he isn\u2019t being a cartoonist. Even though I got him to check all my moles the first time we were in bed together (apparently this happens to doctors a lot), I am refusing to accept his diagnosis on this. I don\u2019t feel depressed. I feel fucking furious. To make matters worse, in my hazy state of mind I have inadvertently stumbled into the midst of the London to Brighton Mini Run. It\u2019s an annual get-together for Mini owners. The smell of petrol hangs in the air. People have dolled up for the occasion. They smoke rollies and drink tinnies. There is a distinct festival vibe. I haven\u2019t had more than four hours of sleep in a row for seven months. I am jumpy and twitchy, like a person on high alert. I want to shout and scream and lie down and curl into a ball and have someone \u2013 anyone \u2013 just take the baby for a few hours and give me time to regroup. I feel like I am on the edge of a psychic fit; some uncontrollable outburst. The Cartoonist has told me he is worried I am \u201calmost psychotic\u201d more than once. But I have no options. My family are far away and I feel as if I should just be getting on with this. Surely not everyone can find it this hard or they just wouldn\u2019t do it, would they? So here I am, almost psychotic, surrounded by jolly mods and Minis \u2013 my least favourite car. The Cartoonist and I have a Mini. It is an old pigeon-coloured thing with one functioning door. The electrics are bust so the windows don\u2019t open. Pieces of upholstery and dashboard keep falling off inside. The Cartoonist and I argue every time we try and get into (or out of) it. The passenger door has been broken for two years but it will cost more to get it fixed than the car is worth. Getting a baby in and out is a gymnastic feat. I often end up literally on my arse in the street, baby held aloft, bags scattered. Travelling 300 miles to see either set of relatives, in Manchester and Wales respectively, is a logistical nightmare. The Cartoonist refuses to get rid of the Mini (he\u2019s had it for 10 years) and I see this as him digging his heels in, like some kind of eternal bachelor in denial about his new responsibilities. The Mini convention feels like something sent from my subconscious to mock me, and I can\u2019t get out. It\u2019s like a bad dream. People must be wondering why I\u2019m charging ahead with such a thunderous look on my face. My phone vibrates in my pocket; I have it on silent so as not to wake the baby in the precious moments that he sleeps. I miss calls, but then people are calling less. My whole life has become one of shutting down, switching off, retreating into darkness. It\u2019s a text from The Cartoonist: Where are you? I text back. It\u2019s hard to type while walking and steering. He\u2019s worried, but I also want to vent at him. I am the master of angry texts, especially angry nocturnal texts when he is away (how come he gets to go away?). \u201cI am stuck in the middle of a Mini convention...\u201d I wait a moment, and then I launch my irresistible punchline. \u201cAnd I fucking hate Minis.\u201d He doesn\u2019t rise to it, not today. I half expect him to. He\u2019d love it here. He\u2019d blend right in. Not like me, with my three-day-old clothes and scraped-up hair and foul demeanour. He texts back. I look, expecting some lengthy and passionate defence of his beloved Minis, but no. He says: I\u2019m going to get on my bike and meet you at the marina. I do not reply. I do not look for him on the cycle path. I stomp on. Everyone and everything is in my way. Sunday is in my way. Life is in my way. By the time I get to the marina I am a ball of rage, some kind of dying earthbound sun, a red giant on her way out. We buy burgers. As we sit down, where it is quieter, the baby wakes and looks at me. My heart pounds in my chest, as it does in the night, as it does any time he might need me. I pull out his bottle. The baby accepts the bottle and sucks on it. The knot in my chest \u2013 the constant knot \u2013 slackens off a little. I chomp on the burger joylessly, not tasting it, hawking and squeezing it down my dry throat. My love for food \u2013 like my love for most things \u2013 has mostly disappeared. I eat whole packs of biscuits, mindlessly, to stay awake in the afternoon. I shovel in jumbo bars of chocolate, barely chewing. Sugar is my fix \u2013 but also, I sense a self-destruction in these acts. Self-loathing, the like of which I have never known. A darkness that is deepening and widening, right through the centre of me. The Cartoonist watches me eat. I shake my head and scowl. I don\u2019t want to be watched. Don\u2019t want to be scrutinised. Leave me alone in my\u2026 My brain says it before I consciously allow it to. Misery. And there it is. Boom. I am miserable. And I know it. I start to cry. The Cartoonist nods and hugs me. \u201cI think I might be depressed,\u201d I say. \u201cYes. Will you go and see someone?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll go and see someone else for a potential diagnosis,\u201d I say. His face sort of crumples, but it\u2019s all I can give him right now. I am so ashamed. The floodgates have opened and I can\u2019t stop crying. How did this happen? I am tough. I am smart. I have built a career. I have lived alone. I have spent decades carving out a life for myself that feels fulfilling. Now I am cracking, right down the middle. Rewind six months, to November 2016. My son\u2019s birth was chaotic. I tore badly. I had an instant urge to protect him, but it wasn\u2019t what I\u2019d call bonding. The only thing I was bonding to was the wrong kind of maternity pad. Ouch. Breastfeeding was equally tough. I got mastitis, then thrush, and then my son got teeth \u2013 at 16 weeks. My hips hurt every night \u2013 sometimes so much I cried, maxed out on painkillers, unable to get comfortable. I was told it was \u201cnormal\u201d to have pain for \u201cabout a year\u201d after childbirth. Meanwhile, I was Whac-a-Moling a haemorrhoid every other day. But that wasn\u2019t the worst of it. The worst of it was the sleep deprivation. My son was a bad sleeper from the start. There are not even words to describe that level of tiredness. \u201cBone-tired\u201d is the closest I can get, but my bones felt like they had dissolved \u2013 along with my frontal lobe. I couldn\u2019t finish sentences. There is a reason sleep deprivation is used as torture. At night, in bed, I get flashes of bright white behind my eyes \u2013 bursts of adrenaline, I learn \u2013 the split second the baby starts crying. I run out of supermarkets \u2013 basket abandoned in the aisle \u2013 whenever he cries, dashing home in a panic, crying myself. *** But it becomes more than tiredness, more than \u201cbaby blues\u201d \u2013 it calcifies into something deeper, more lethal. As the months go on, and winter turns to spring, I get darker inside. I have to start working again \u2013 I want to start working again. I am a self-employed writer, and it hasn\u2019t come easy. But new mothers are not supported, financially or holistically, by the state or system. In fact, I feel actively discouraged. The Cartoonist is great, but I have become a person he doesn\u2019t know; a person who screams and shouts, and whom he finds on her knees sobbing in the kitchen as the baby naps. With no extended family nearby, I just have to keep working and not sleeping and feeling like I\u2019m doing a shit job of the lot. When I allow myself to compare myself to other people, my pride clouds things. I feel like a loser for not coping. I lie to my health visitor. I lie to my friends. I am lying to myself.

      "body": "<p>This is a memoir of a very young woman winning a very long horse race in Mongolia. Lara Prior-Palmer was 19 when in 2013, to the surprise of all, she became the first woman to win the 1,000km Mongol Derby (the course of which is based on Genghis Khan\u2019s 13th-century horse messenger system). I am afraid of horses, bored by competitive sports and no more interested in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2018/oct/19/vast-deserts-majestic-mountains-endless-plains-mongolia-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Mongolia</a> than a person of average curiosity should be, and yet I found <em>Rough Magic</em> strangely compelling.</p> <p>It\u2019s not the writing, which veers between adolescent philosophising (\u201canimals were our first teachers\u201d) and moments of raw brilliance. It\u2019s not the quest narrative of the race, because we know from the beginning that our heroine wins. It\u2019s not the landscape, because Prior-Palmer resists romanticism (\u201clittle rock there again, little bush here again\u201d), and if you\u2019re trying to ride across the steppe as fast as possible, landscape is mostly an inconvenience. The charm of <em>Rough Magic </em>is rather that of the narrator herself, an English ing\u00e9nue who could come straight from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/07/behind-the-mask-the-life-of-vita-sackville-west-matthew-dennison-review\" title=\"\">Vita Sackville-West</a> until you see glimpses of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/shirley-jackson\" title=\"\">Shirley Jackson</a>. She enters the race after the deadline, far too late to train or even assemble the right kit for racing such a huge distance on 25 Mongolian horses. She eats all her snacks when bored at start camp before the race begins, and for the same reason takes all her painkillers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatories out of their packaging and jumbles them together unrecognisably. She forgets to take the pill and doesn\u2019t pack sanitary protection so she ends up bleeding on to the saddle. She doesn\u2019t take a change of clothes or toilet paper, is nowhere near the 5kg baggage limit, can\u2019t work the GPS.</p> <p>And yet, in narrative terms, she knows exactly what she is doing: the mythical version of this story, she says, \u201cappealing to a certain British psyche\u201d, is \u201cgirl on erotic power animal traverses the exotic\u201d. For most of the race she is ambivalent about the idea of winning \u2013 such a conformist obsession, unfamiliar to a natural truant, the black sheep of a family committed to getting on and getting in (to Oxford) \u2013 and the moment of triumph brings embarrassment and anticlimax. The effort, anyway, was not exactly to be first, but to stop Devan, a pink-clad Texas blonde from winning. Devan annoys Lara from the beginning by being well-trained, well-prepared, well-sponsored and hubristically certain of her own victory. Someone needs to take her down: \u201cShe does need toppling. Momentarily I imagine her with antlers.\u201d But at the end, when Devan lies weeping, \u201cquaking like a washing machine\u201d, there\u2019s just awkwardness. It\u2019s the resistance to the obvious narratives that makes <em>Rough Magic</em> so appealing: the book undermines lazy women-in-the-wilderness tropes at every turn. The narrator is not \u201cfeisty\u201d or \u201cquirky\u201d, just a bright young woman out of her depth, persisting out of cheerful spite and narrative momentum rather than any noble calling. She\u2019s annoyed by the horses at least as often as in mystical communion with them. She cries when things hurt, argues with her brothers in her head, doesn\u2019t call home even when she wins. The insistence on a messy, mildly malicious and generally uncooperative form of youthful success is fresh and very cheering.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Rough Magic is published by Ebury (\u00a316.99).

A prophet in the wilderness, Batt battled \u2013 often forlornly \u2013 to persuade the FA to open their eyes to the immense potential of women\u2019s football.</p> \n<p>Although the ruling body did lift the ban three months after his rebels returned from Mexico City, it was done in a slightly grudging manner, with women allowed to play at FA-affiliated grounds but advised, albeit tacitly, to \u201cstay in your lane\u201d.</p> \n<p>Batt continued to be largely ostracised by Lancaster Gate\u2019s top brass. He was met with a complete lack of interest, says Jean Williams, professor of sport at Wolverhampton University, as well as \u201coutright chauvinism.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet in Mexico City, in August 1971, his 14-strong squad were treated like royalty from the moment they walked through passport control into a brave new world of flashing cameras and cheering crowds. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to the Mexicans that we were female, it was football,\u201d says Lockwood. \u201cBut it was thanks to Harry and his wife June, who helped run the team, that we were there. Harry had a big vision for women\u2019s football; we hope that now he\u2019ll finally be recognised.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was 20 years before Fifa staged the first official Women\u2019s World Cup but their commercial department was made to look several yards off the pace by Martini &amp; Rossi, sponsors of Mexico \u201971, who funded travel and accommodation for the six participating teams.</p> \n<p>A year earlier, the drinks company had also facilitated the first unofficial women\u2019s World Cup in Italy but 1971 elevated the game to a whole new level, with 110,000 watching Denmark beat Mexico 3-0 in the final.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"21c2c6524e91d7c6420619c9f9b744fb82f8ee06\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21c2c6524e91d7c6420619c9f9b744fb82f8ee06/0_0_5000_2310/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Susanne Augustesen (centre) scores the first goal of her hat-trick as Denmark beat 3-0 in the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup final and captain Inger Pedersen hoist the trophy high as she\u2019s chair around the pitch in celebration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"462\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Susanne Augustesen (centre) scores the first goal of her hat-trick as Denmark beat 3-0 in the 1971 Women\u2019s World Cup final and captain Inger Pedersen hoist the trophy high as she\u2019s chair around the pitch in celebration.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Polfot/Ritzau/Press Association Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By way of heightening marketing appeal to a female audience, the goal frames were painted in pink and white hoops, all stadium staff wore pink outfits and pop-up hair and beauty salons appeared outside the Azteca Stadium.</p> \n<p>\u201cMexico \u201971 was a success because the organisers planned it very well and were very financially shrewd,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThey never assumed it would be a commercial or sporting failure.

It was as if it had never happened. There was nothing \u2013 and no one \u2013 to give us a voice, so we kept our story to ourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>It would be another 15 years before Fifa embraced the women\u2019s game and that came only after a hefty nudge from the Norwegians back in Mexico City \u2013 evidently the early de facto capital of women\u2019s football. Perhaps it had something to do with the rarefied, high altitude, air but, at the 1986 Fifa congress, the delegation from Oslo succeeded in persuading the international ruling body to take \u201cthe fillies\u201d fully under its wing. Seven years later the FA finally followed suit.</p> \n<p>An awful lot of water had passed under the bridge since 1628 and the first recorded match involving women in Europe. Documents from south Lanarkshire dating back almost 400 years detail a Scottish church minister\u2019s outraged condemnation of the men and women spied playing mixed football across Carstairs village green on the sabbath.</p> \n<p>France 2019 may be Scotland\u2019s first World Cup but, like Mexico, the country provided a significant staging post in the world\u2019s game\u2019s history. Edinburgh quite possibly witnessed the birth of international fixtures when, late in the 19th century, a team of English women crossed Hadrian\u2019s Wall to face a home side led by Helen Graham Matthews. A riot erupted among 5,000 extremely excited spectators and, shortly afterwards, women\u2019s football was outlawed across Scotland. Graham Matthews simply decamped to London where she joined forces with Nettie Honeyball in establishing the British Ladies\u2019 Football Club in 1895.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2019/may/31/womens-football-match-crouch-end-1895\">Their first fixture, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2019/may/31/womens-football-match-crouch-end-1895\">at the Crouch End Athletic Ground in Hornsey, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/from-the-archive-blog/2019/may/31/womens-football-match-crouch-end-1895\">north London</a>, attracted a 12,000-strong crowd and stemmed from a newspaper advert placed by Honeyball \u2013 a pseudonym \u2013 seeking players.

For several decades the female game virtually disappeared from public view \u2013 and not only in England.</p> \n<p>France banned it in 1932, West Germany in 1955, Norway in 1931 and Brazil from 1941. They were not alone. As an era of socially conservative rightwing dictatorships assumed power across South America, a sport the continent\u2019s historians had noted women first playing in the early 1900s entered hibernation became an isolated, almost underground, movement.</p> \n<p>West Germany\u2019s DFB depicted their ban as a defence of femininity. \u201cThis aggressive sport is essentially alien to the nature of woman,\u201d it decreed in 1955. \u201cIn the fight for the ball, the feminine grace vanishes, body and soul will inevitably suffer harm \u2026 The display of the woman\u2019s body offends decency and modesty.\u201d</p> \n<p>An Englishman named Percy Ashley was among those infuriated by such blatant sexism. In 1949 he enabled his football-mad daughter, Doris, to play by founding Manchester Corinthians, a side comprised mainly of typists and machinists.</p> \n<p>The Corinthians became so quietly successful that the Red Cross flew them to South America for a series of fundraising matches. Subsequent tours of Europe and North Africa helped raise a collective \u00a3275,000 for the charity and, in 1957, they won an unofficial tournament in Germany with Bert Trautmann, of Manchester City goalkeeping fame, acting as interpreter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fd8293711fa1c74bc578fd9c0c1d17f1ca266dc4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd8293711fa1c74bc578fd9c0c1d17f1ca266dc4/0_0_4582_1592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manchester Corinthians players board a plane to Reims, France, in 1970, for an international tournament, where one of the teams they faced was Juventus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"347\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester Corinthians players board a plane to Reims, France, in 1970, for an international tournament, where one of the teams they faced was Juventus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Football Museum</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet without a national framework and institutionalised support, teams like the Corinthians represented rare oases in a footballing desert.</p> \n<p>The importance of state endorsement was highlighted in the United States in 1972. No matter that North American women were late to the party and did not begin kicking balls in earnest until the 70s; a piece of federal legislation known as Title IX would not merely serve as a catalyst for radical change but alter an entire nation\u2019s sporting topography.</p> \n<p>Title IX is the reason the US remain the foremost power in women\u2019s football and head to France as World Cup holders. In enforcing gender equality in high school and college education, both academic and sporting, it created a legal imperative that female athletes be afforded equal rights to federal financial assistance.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward to a sweltering Californian afternoon in 1999 as, with a single swipe of her supposedly weak left foot, Brandi Chastain converted the final penalty of the tensest of shootouts against China to win the World Cup for the US.</p> \n<p>As she celebrated by whipping off her shirt to reveal a black sports bra, the 90,185 crowd inside Pasadena\u2019s Rose Bowl swayed to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Let\u2019s Get Loud. Admittedly Chastain\u2019s iconic cameo would eventually be seen as a starting gun for evolution rather than revolution but, temporarily at least, the planet woke up to the potential of women\u2019s football.</p> \n<p>A defender with two reconstructed knees dubbed \u201cHollywood\u201d by teammates in homage to her love of big occasions and bright lights, Chastain tricked China\u2019s goalkeeper by deciding against taking the kick with her preferred right foot. \u201cAs I walked up I thought: \u2018Don\u2019t look at the keeper,\u2019\u201d Chastian recalls. \u201cWhen I hit it everything went into slow motion, it was like being in a car accident.

Fifa\u2019s concerns about its brand somehow being tainted by female involvement provoked a compromise whereby the word \u201cCup\u201d was dropped from a tournament sponsored by Mars and named The First Fifa World Championship for Women\u2019s Football. Games lasted only 80 minutes. \u201cFifa was afraid our ovaries were going to fall out,\u201d deadpanned the then-US captain April Heinrichs in Gemma Clarke\u2019s excellent book Soccerwomen.</p> \n<p>Women\u2019s football had been banned in China until 1970 and the tournament was televised merely on domestic channels but, contrary to expectations, grounds were packed. Almost 65,000 filled the Guangdong Stadium to see Michelle Akers score twice as the US beat Norway 2-1 in the final. Considering the Americans suffered debilitating stomach upsets and arrived clutching toilet rolls to equip them for Guangdong\u2019s hole-in-the-ground lavatories it was quite an achievement.</p> \n<p>Other countries started taking note. Denmark, Italy, Norway and Sweden were initially the most enlightened but Germany swiftly caught up. A side propelled by the free-scoring, three-times world footballer of the year Birgit Prinz proceeded to five straight European Championships in addition to the 2003 and 2007 World Cups.

A Japan side starring midfielder Homare Sawa beat the US in the final, with those positions reversed at Canada 2015.</p> \n<p>It was a far cry from 1980 when Japan staged its first women\u2019s tournament.

      "bodyText": "Almost 50 years have passed since they stepped off the plane and into a parallel universe but their memories of the full-scale assault on the senses remain as vivid as ever. \u201cIt was utterly surreal, like going to Narnia; we were being transported to a different world,\u201d says Chris Lockwood. \u201cNothing prepared us for the crowds, the noise. It was amazing. \u201cWe\u2019d gone from playing on park pitches and suddenly we were running out in front of 80,000 people inside huge stadiums and being invited to a cocktail party at the British Embassy. It was an unknown world. We didn\u2019t realise it at the time but it was a moment in history.\u201d Lockwood was part of a band of pioneers who, during an era when the Football Association barred women from playing a game they deemed \u201cquite unsuitable for females\u201d, represented a rebel England side which in 1971 participated in an unofficial World Cup in Mexico. She and her teammates helped rekindle interest in a sport which burgeoned in Britain after the first world war but, in 1921, was banned for 50 years by the FA. Phil Neville\u2019s fully professional England squad would do well to spare a thought for Lockwood, her fellow trailblazers and the man who made it all possible. The late Harry Batt, manager of both that convention-challenging, prejudice-defying, 1971 team and Chiltern Valley Ladies, was a visionary. A prophet in the wilderness, Batt battled \u2013 often forlornly \u2013 to persuade the FA to open their eyes to the immense potential of women\u2019s football. Although the ruling body did lift the ban three months after his rebels returned from Mexico City, it was done in a slightly grudging manner, with women allowed to play at FA-affiliated grounds but advised, albeit tacitly, to \u201cstay in your lane\u201d. Batt continued to be largely ostracised by Lancaster Gate\u2019s top brass. He was met with a complete lack of interest, says Jean Williams, professor of sport at Wolverhampton University, as well as \u201coutright chauvinism.\u201d Yet in Mexico City, in August 1971, his 14-strong squad were treated like royalty from the moment they walked through passport control into a brave new world of flashing cameras and cheering crowds. \u201cIt didn\u2019t matter to the Mexicans that we were female, it was football,\u201d says Lockwood. \u201cBut it was thanks to Harry and his wife June, who helped run the team, that we were there. Harry had a big vision for women\u2019s football; we hope that now he\u2019ll finally be recognised.\u201d It was 20 years before Fifa staged the first official Women\u2019s World Cup but their commercial department was made to look several yards off the pace by Martini &amp; Rossi, sponsors of Mexico \u201971, who funded travel and accommodation for the six participating teams. A year earlier, the drinks company had also facilitated the first unofficial women\u2019s World Cup in Italy but 1971 elevated the game to a whole new level, with 110,000 watching Denmark beat Mexico 3-0 in the final. By way of heightening marketing appeal to a female audience, the goal frames were painted in pink and white hoops, all stadium staff wore pink outfits and pop-up hair and beauty salons appeared outside the Azteca Stadium. \u201cMexico \u201971 was a success because the organisers planned it very well and were very financially shrewd,\u201d says Williams. \u201cThey never assumed it would be a commercial or sporting failure. It was sold and promoted as a proper football tournament that just happened to feature females.\u201d Indeed it was such a hit that Williams discovered the media coverage extended to a Mexican soft porn magazine. \u201cThe match reports were the only non-smutty thing in it,\u201d she says. England lost their three games but, considering they were unable to play on proper pitches at home and their squad contained three teenagers in Lockwood, then 15, Gill Sayell, 14, and Leah Caleb, 13, Batt\u2019s side departed with heads held high. \u201cThe games were extremely physical,\u201d recalls Caleb. \u201cThe one against Argentina was brutal \u2013 two players ended up in plaster casts.\u201d Not that anyone in England seemed remotely interested. The three teenagers simply returned to school and immediate anonymity. \u201cIn Mexico we\u2019d been on television, had police escorts, done interviews, signed autographs and been welcomed by the British Embassy, but nothing was said at school,\u201d says Lockwood. \u201cNo teacher ever mentioned it. It was as if it had never happened. There was nothing \u2013 and no one \u2013 to give us a voice, so we kept our story to ourselves.\u201d It would be another 15 years before Fifa embraced the women\u2019s game and that came only after a hefty nudge from the Norwegians back in Mexico City \u2013 evidently the early de facto capital of women\u2019s football. Perhaps it had something to do with the rarefied, high altitude, air but, at the 1986 Fifa congress, the delegation from Oslo succeeded in persuading the international ruling body to take \u201cthe fillies\u201d fully under its wing. Seven years later the FA finally followed suit. An awful lot of water had passed under the bridge since 1628 and the first recorded match involving women in Europe. Documents from south Lanarkshire dating back almost 400 years detail a Scottish church minister\u2019s outraged condemnation of the men and women spied playing mixed football across Carstairs village green on the sabbath. France 2019 may be Scotland\u2019s first World Cup but, like Mexico, the country provided a significant staging post in the world\u2019s game\u2019s history. Edinburgh quite possibly witnessed the birth of international fixtures when, late in the 19th century, a team of English women crossed Hadrian\u2019s Wall to face a home side led by Helen Graham Matthews. A riot erupted among 5,000 extremely excited spectators and, shortly afterwards, women\u2019s football was outlawed across Scotland. Graham Matthews simply decamped to London where she joined forces with Nettie Honeyball in establishing the British Ladies\u2019 Football Club in 1895. Their first fixture, at the Crouch End Athletic Ground in Hornsey, north London, attracted a 12,000-strong crowd and stemmed from a newspaper advert placed by Honeyball \u2013 a pseudonym \u2013 seeking players. Thirty, mainly middle-class women responded with the sympathies of most resting firmly with the suffragette movement. Women\u2019s football has often developed along parallel lines to feminism, its periods of rapid growth invariably coinciding with waves of wider emancipation. Tellingly, Honeyball was anxious to demonstrate that, liberated from their uncomfortable and oppressively restrictive Victorian clothing, women could be athletic and physically capable. Honeyball found a soulmate in Lady Florence Dixie. A Scottish war correspondent, explorer and feminist, Lady Florence variously reported on South Africa\u2019s Boer and Anglo Zulu wars, traversed Patagonia and became president of the British Ladies. She died of diphtheria before the first world war opened the game to a much broader, more working-class constituency. With so many men suddenly spirited away to fight on foreign fields, women staffed farms and factories and it was not long before many enjoyed regular lunchtime kickabouts. Soon they were playing organised matches with spectators\u2019 admission money funnelled to the charities which fulfilled the societal functions later performed by the NHS and the welfare state. \u201cWomen who had previously been in service worked outside the home for the first time,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIt was a huge change.\u201d Perhaps the most celebrated factory team was Dick, Kerr\u2019s Ladies in Preston, which raised a collective sum equivalent to millions of pounds in today\u2019s money, but the game also blossomed among those employed by munitions factories, particularly in Northumberland and Durham. In 2018 a blue plaque was finally installed at Croft Park, home of Blyth Spartans, in honour of Bella Reay who scored 133 goals in a single season as the club\u2019s Ladies won the Munitionettes\u2019 Cup. Little did she know it but Reay was playing in an era which laid the foundations of female football\u2019s eventual globalisation and has turned some of her north-east-born successors, most notably Lucy Bronze, Steph Houghton and Jill Scott \u2013 very much the nucleus of Neville\u2019s England \u2013 into international stars. Accordingly the war\u2019s end prefaced the advent of European competition and, in 1920, a French team managed by a leading feminist named Alice Milliat crossed the channel for a tour which kicked off with the players arriving in Preston to be serenaded by a brass band and streets lined by thousands of cheering fans. Boxing Day 1920 suggested that women\u2019s football was more popular than the men\u2019s version when Dick, Kerr\u2019s Ladies v St Helens Ladies at Goodison Park attracted 53,000 supporters with a further 15,000 turned away. The famous Lyons coffee houses supported a number of teams, frequently decorating their cake boxes with pictures of women kicking balls. A 21st century equivalent would involve images of Houghton or Bronze adorning Starbucks or Costa merchandise. In 1921 the FA took fright and, after consulting \u201cmedical experts\u201d, made the reactionary decision to bar women from playing on all affiliated grounds. For several decades the female game virtually disappeared from public view \u2013 and not only in England. France banned it in 1932, West Germany in 1955, Norway in 1931 and Brazil from 1941. They were not alone. As an era of socially conservative rightwing dictatorships assumed power across South America, a sport the continent\u2019s historians had noted women first playing in the early 1900s entered hibernation became an isolated, almost underground, movement. West Germany\u2019s DFB depicted their ban as a defence of femininity. \u201cThis aggressive sport is essentially alien to the nature of woman,\u201d it decreed in 1955. \u201cIn the fight for the ball, the feminine grace vanishes, body and soul will inevitably suffer harm \u2026 The display of the woman\u2019s body offends decency and modesty.\u201d An Englishman named Percy Ashley was among those infuriated by such blatant sexism. In 1949 he enabled his football-mad daughter, Doris, to play by founding Manchester Corinthians, a side comprised mainly of typists and machinists. The Corinthians became so quietly successful that the Red Cross flew them to South America for a series of fundraising matches. Subsequent tours of Europe and North Africa helped raise a collective \u00a3275,000 for the charity and, in 1957, they won an unofficial tournament in Germany with Bert Trautmann, of Manchester City goalkeeping fame, acting as interpreter. Yet without a national framework and institutionalised support, teams like the Corinthians represented rare oases in a footballing desert. The importance of state endorsement was highlighted in the United States in 1972. No matter that North American women were late to the party and did not begin kicking balls in earnest until the 70s; a piece of federal legislation known as Title IX would not merely serve as a catalyst for radical change but alter an entire nation\u2019s sporting topography. Title IX is the reason the US remain the foremost power in women\u2019s football and head to France as World Cup holders. In enforcing gender equality in high school and college education, both academic and sporting, it created a legal imperative that female athletes be afforded equal rights to federal financial assistance. Fast-forward to a sweltering Californian afternoon in 1999 as, with a single swipe of her supposedly weak left foot, Brandi Chastain converted the final penalty of the tensest of shootouts against China to win the World Cup for the US. As she celebrated by whipping off her shirt to reveal a black sports bra, the 90,185 crowd inside Pasadena\u2019s Rose Bowl swayed to Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Let\u2019s Get Loud. Admittedly Chastain\u2019s iconic cameo would eventually be seen as a starting gun for evolution rather than revolution but, temporarily at least, the planet woke up to the potential of women\u2019s football. A defender with two reconstructed knees dubbed \u201cHollywood\u201d by teammates in homage to her love of big occasions and bright lights, Chastain tricked China\u2019s goalkeeper by deciding against taking the kick with her preferred right foot. \u201cAs I walked up I thought: \u2018Don\u2019t look at the keeper,\u2019\u201d Chastian recalls. \u201cWhen I hit it everything went into slow motion, it was like being in a car accident. It was life affirming.\u201d Eight years earlier the first official World Cup \u2013 well sort of \u2013 had taken place in China. Fifa\u2019s concerns about its brand somehow being tainted by female involvement provoked a compromise whereby the word \u201cCup\u201d was dropped from a tournament sponsored by Mars and named The First Fifa World Championship for Women\u2019s Football. Games lasted only 80 minutes. \u201cFifa was afraid our ovaries were going to fall out,\u201d deadpanned the then-US captain April Heinrichs in Gemma Clarke\u2019s excellent book Soccerwomen. Women\u2019s football had been banned in China until 1970 and the tournament was televised merely on domestic channels but, contrary to expectations, grounds were packed. Almost 65,000 filled the Guangdong Stadium to see Michelle Akers score twice as the US beat Norway 2-1 in the final. Considering the Americans suffered debilitating stomach upsets and arrived clutching toilet rolls to equip them for Guangdong\u2019s hole-in-the-ground lavatories it was quite an achievement. Other countries started taking note. Denmark, Italy, Norway and Sweden were initially the most enlightened but Germany swiftly caught up. A side propelled by the free-scoring, three-times world footballer of the year Birgit Prinz proceeded to five straight European Championships in addition to the 2003 and 2007 World Cups. After Prinz\u2019s retirement, they defended the Euros in 2013. Germany had aimed for a World Cup hat-trick in 2011, staged on home soil, but a star was rising in the east and the hosts were knocked out by the Nadeshiko in the quarter-finals. A Japan side starring midfielder Homare Sawa beat the US in the final, with those positions reversed at Canada 2015. It was a far cry from 1980 when Japan staged its first women\u2019s tournament. Played eight-a-side on mini pitches using children\u2019s footballs, halves lasted 25 minutes and handballs were permissible if they protected players\u2019 breasts. Change was eventually driven by business behemoths. During the late 1980s, at the height of Japan\u2019s economic boom, leading companies including Nissan began sponsoring teams in a new semi-professional league. Players were allocated office jobs allowing ample time off for training regimes big on technical skills. As the years passed, exceptional women footballers around the world such as Brazil\u2019s Marta \u2013 dubbed \u201cPel\u00e9 in a skirt\u201d \u2013 challenged accepted narratives about patriarchal cultures and male and female behavioural conventions. Yet as Lockwood prepares to cheer the Lionesses on in France she reflects on a wasted opportunity. \u201cMexico \u201971 was the stepping stone for women\u2019s football to move forward but the FA missed a big chance,\u201d she reflects. \u201cI feel sorry for the girls who came after us and didn\u2019t get the same opportunities but I\u2019m so pleased, so thrilled, to see today\u2019s England players finally getting everything they deserve.

I taped daily news articles about it to my school desk until a teacher gently told me that the images of a bandaged baby were upsetting my classmates. This was not the first child-down-a-well news story in the States, and nor was I the first child to become obsessed: in 1949, three-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down a well in California; reports of her ultimately doomed rescue were closely followed by Americans. One was Woody Allen, who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AgS2agDgZfw\" title=\"\">immortalised this sad saga</a> in one of my favourite of his movies, Radio Days, renaming Fiscus as Polly Phelps. In it, he shows himself, as a kid, listening to the story with his parents, who cling to him. The message was that the adults cannot always keep you safe, the most formative lesson of all.</p> <p>The so-called <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/17/nyregion/beaten-jogger-testifies-but-cannot-recall-attack.html?rref=collection%2Ftimestopic%2FCentral%20Park%20Jogger%20Case%20(1989)&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=timestopics&amp;region=stream&amp;module=stream_unit&amp;version=latest&amp;contentPlacement=210&amp;pgtype=collection\" title=\"\">Central Park jogger case</a> was a different kind of story. For a start, the person who the papers reported was the victim \u2013 the jogger \u2013 wasn\u2019t a child. She was a 28-year-old woman, later named as Trisha Meili. But she worked in the same office as my father, and lived three streets away from us in New York, so felt entirely knowable to me. On the evening of 19 April 1989, Meili went jogging in Central Park, where she was brutally raped and left for dead. Five teenage boys \u2013 none of whom were white, as Meili is \u2013 were convicted of the crime, despite a complete lack of DNA evidence. They became known as the Central Park Five, and their lives are now told in Ava DuVernay\u2019s new Netflix series, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/arts/television/when-they-see-us-real-story.html\" title=\"\">When They See Us</a>. (I still prefer non-fiction to fiction when it comes to crime stories, too, and so lean more towards Ken Burns\u2019 2012 documentary about the case. But no sensible person should dismiss DuVernay\u2019s beautifully heartfelt take.)</p> <p>For those who lived lives of privilege like mine on the Upper East Side, the lesson of the case seemed to be that people from the outside were dangerous, even if those people were teenagers, and \u201coutside\u201d meant Harlem, which is almost walking distance. Certainly one fellow Upper East Sider <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a27586174/when-they-see-us-central-park-5-donald-trump/\" title=\"\">pushed that narrative</a>: Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/central-park-five-donald-trump-jogger-rape-case-new-york\" title=\"\">took out newspaper adverts</a> demanding the death penalty be reinstated, referring to the boys as \u201cmurderers\u201d, even though Meili survived.</p> <p>I understand people\u2019s queasiness about the current popularity of true-crime documentaries and podcasts; no question, some err on the side of prurience. But the Central Park case is especially instructive because the lesson changed over time: in 2002 the actual rapist confessed, and the five were fully cleared. It was painfully clear that, as well as Meili, there had been child victims here: teenagers who were thrown in prison because they were the wrong colour and wrong social class. It was a shaming lesson for those of us who ever took a narcissistic interest in true crime, searching the narrative only for people who looked like them. (Trump still insists that the boys \u2013 now men \u2013 were guilty, and that has been another lesson: that a blatant racist can be elected US president.)</p> <p>I still have a weakness for spiralling out over crime stories about children, but now read them from the paranoid perspective of a parent rather than the wide-eyed one of a child. My early obsession taught me many things, but it also made me certain a bad man was around every corner. I grew up fearful of the world, and now I fear passing this on to my kids. But <em>\u201c</em><em>How do you say it will be all right / When you know that it mightn\u2019t be true?</em>\u201d Sondheim asks in Into The Woods.</p> <p>It might be that this is just an error of perspective. True crime, like fairytales, focuses on the villains, forgetting the people who overturn the wrongful convictions, who rescue the children from the wells, who fight the dragons. There are wolves in the world, but also princes and princesses.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Fairytales \u2013 particularly in their original and frankly sadistic glory \u2013 have long been a way of teaching children about the dangers that lurk outside the home. \u201cPrinces wait there in the world, it\u2019s true / Princes, yes, but wolves and humans, too,\u201d the witch warns Rapunzel in Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Into The Woods, still the smartest take on the way these stories both maintain and destroy childhood innocence. But I never liked fairytales as a kid. I just couldn\u2019t understand the point of these upsetting stories that weren\u2019t even true. Instead, it will possibly not surprise anyone that I was the kind of kid who was obsessed with the news, invariably latching on to stories that involved children who lived lives similar to mine. The killing of six-year-old Lisa Steinberg in 1987 by her lawyer father Joel was the story that taught me that not all parents were like mine, even ones who looked like them. It also taught me about domestic abuse: the brutalised face of Lisa\u2019s mother, Hedda Nussbaum, stared out from newspaper front pages throughout the case. Nussbaum was an author and editor of children\u2019s books, and I had several of them at home, many of which she lovingly dedicated to Joel. The wolf wasn\u2019t in my bedroom, but his shadow was. The rescue of Jessica McClure, the 18-month-old who fell down a well in 1987, was another story that fascinated me. I taped daily news articles about it to my school desk until a teacher gently told me that the images of a bandaged baby were upsetting my classmates. This was not the first child-down-a-well news story in the States, and nor was I the first child to become obsessed: in 1949, three-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down a well in California; reports of her ultimately doomed rescue were closely followed by Americans. One was Woody Allen, who immortalised this sad saga in one of my favourite of his movies, Radio Days, renaming Fiscus as Polly Phelps. In it, he shows himself, as a kid, listening to the story with his parents, who cling to him. The message was that the adults cannot always keep you safe, the most formative lesson of all. The so-called Central Park jogger case was a different kind of story. For a start, the person who the papers reported was the victim \u2013 the jogger \u2013 wasn\u2019t a child. She was a 28-year-old woman, later named as Trisha Meili. But she worked in the same office as my father, and lived three streets away from us in New York, so felt entirely knowable to me. On the evening of 19 April 1989, Meili went jogging in Central Park, where she was brutally raped and left for dead. Five teenage boys \u2013 none of whom were white, as Meili is \u2013 were convicted of the crime, despite a complete lack of DNA evidence. They became known as the Central Park Five, and their lives are now told in Ava DuVernay\u2019s new Netflix series, When They See Us. (I still prefer non-fiction to fiction when it comes to crime stories, too, and so lean more towards Ken Burns\u2019 2012 documentary about the case. But no sensible person should dismiss DuVernay\u2019s beautifully heartfelt take.) For those who lived lives of privilege like mine on the Upper East Side, the lesson of the case seemed to be that people from the outside were dangerous, even if those people were teenagers, and \u201coutside\u201d meant Harlem, which is almost walking distance. Certainly one fellow Upper East Sider pushed that narrative: Donald Trump took out newspaper adverts demanding the death penalty be reinstated, referring to the boys as \u201cmurderers\u201d, even though Meili survived. I understand people\u2019s queasiness about the current popularity of true-crime documentaries and podcasts; no question, some err on the side of prurience. But the Central Park case is especially instructive because the lesson changed over time: in 2002 the actual rapist confessed, and the five were fully cleared. It was painfully clear that, as well as Meili, there had been child victims here: teenagers who were thrown in prison because they were the wrong colour and wrong social class. It was a shaming lesson for those of us who ever took a narcissistic interest in true crime, searching the narrative only for people who looked like them. (Trump still insists that the boys \u2013 now men \u2013 were guilty, and that has been another lesson: that a blatant racist can be elected US president.) I still have a weakness for spiralling out over crime stories about children, but now read them from the paranoid perspective of a parent rather than the wide-eyed one of a child. My early obsession taught me many things, but it also made me certain a bad man was around every corner. I grew up fearful of the world, and now I fear passing this on to my kids. But \u201cHow do you say it will be all right / When you know that it mightn\u2019t be true?\u201d Sondheim asks in Into The Woods. It might be that this is just an error of perspective. True crime, like fairytales, focuses on the villains, forgetting the people who overturn the wrongful convictions, who rescue the children from the wells, who fight the dragons. There are wolves in the world, but also princes and princesses.",

Digital is binary - it either works or it doesn\u2019t. You won\u2019t get a better picture from a gold cable.</p> <h2>Nylon braided or Kevlar reinforced</h2> <p>As much use as a Ferrari in a snowstorm, fancy Kevlar or nylon braided cables add nothing unless you\u2019re working them hard. Most cables spend their life plugged in and left alone, but those taken on the road \u2013 here\u2019s looking at you, phone cable \u2013 might last a bit longer with some strengthening.</p> <h2>Watch for HDMI cable specs</h2> <p>The materials don\u2019t really matter for digital cables, but their specifications do. Most are mercifully straightforward.</p> <p>HDMI \u2013 most commonly used to connect things to your TV \u2013 comes in various versions including 1.4, 2.0 and 2.1, which are backwards compatible, for example a 2.1 cable will work with anything earlier. Version 2.0 has been the main standard since 2013, meaning most HDMI cables sold over the last five or so years work with 2.0a/b.</p> <p>In January 2017 HDMI 2.1 was released to support higher than 4K content, but very few devices actually use it and most existing cables already support the majority of the new features. Only if you\u2019re trying to watch 4K at 120Hz (60Hz is standard) or 8K video do you need new \u201cultra high speed\u201d HDMI 2.1 cables \u2013 an unlikely event for most consumers.</p> <p>There are also HDMI cables that support ethernet connectivity, which are backwards compatible but as barely anything in the home actually uses the ethernet bit don\u2019t spend extra on them.</p> <p>A good quality high speed HDMI 2.0 cable should cost about \u00a35.</p> <h2>Ethernet cables have categories</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b1d3bb252e9374f21ee988e8886518db0e191d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b1d3bb252e9374f21ee988e8886518db0e191d1/164_325_4823_2895/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ethernet cables are cheap, but there are a few difference between them that aren\u2019t immediately obvious.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ethernet cables are cheap, but there are a few difference between them that aren\u2019t immediately obvious.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Speaking of ethernet, not all ethernet cables are born equal. While all the connectors are the same RJ45 jack, you commonly find cat5/5e or cat6 cables. The \u201ccat\u201d number indicates the quality of the materials and insulation within the cable, which affects its maximum transmission speed.</p> <p>The cheaper cat5 can support speeds up to 1Gbps where cat6 supports up to 10Gbps - for reference the average UK broadband speed is just 55Mbps or 0.055Gbps. The actual speed you get is entirely dependent on what you\u2019re connecting \u2013 a slow internet connection is not going to be made faster by a high spec cable \u2013 so unless you know you need to transfer data over 1Gbps don\u2019t spend the extra on cat6 cables. You want \u201cpatch\u201d cables if you\u2019re connecting a computer or similar to a router. If you\u2019re laying ethernet cable into walls or under the floor buy the best you can so you don\u2019t have to rip it all up again in the future.</p> <p>Cat5 ethernet cables cost as little as \u00a31, while cat6 ethernet cables cost go from \u00a34.</p> <h2>You don\u2019t need your original phone cables to charge</h2> <p>Charging cables for phones are probably the most lost or broken cables around. The good news is that most phones support a variety of cables: you don\u2019t need to use the one that came with it.</p> <p>Apple\u2019s iPhone uses the proprietary Lighting cable, but you don\u2019t have to buy Apple\u2019s \u00a319 cable each time you break or lose it. Quality certified Lightning cables cost just \u00a35 from Amazon. But if you want to charge your iPhone faster, you\u2019ll need a Lightning to USB-C cable, which Apple charges \u00a319 for 1m or \u00a335 for 2m \u2013 but yours for just \u00a312 on Amazon.</p> <p>For Android phones you have a choice of the old microUSB or the new USB-C. Both cables are universal and available from a variety of third-party manufacturers, with quality versions costing as little as \u00a36.</p> <p>Some smartphones have proprietary fast charging standards, including OnePlus and Huawei, which need special cables to go with special chargers to hit their max charging speeds. But they will still fast charge with standard USB-C cables and third-party chargers.</p> <h2>Nor do you need your original phone charger</h2> <p>Just like cables, you don\u2019t need to use the charger that came with your phone. There are many third-party chargers that can not only charge your phone faster but also have multiple ports for powering up more than one device at a time.</p> <p>There are multiple charging standards, including Qualcomm\u2019s Quick Charge, the standard USB-PD (Power Delivery) and special fast-charging tech such as OnePlus Warp Charge or Huawei SuperCharge. The good news is that most of them are cross compatible with USB-C chargers that use USB-PD, meaning you can fast charge almost any modern smartphone, tablet or laptop with a USB-C charger.</p> <p>Apple, for instance, still ships its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/04/apple-iphone-xs-review-battery-life-camera-design-performance\">\u00a3999 iPhones</a> with weak 5W USB chargers. With a USB-PD supporting 18W or greater and a USB-C to Lighting cable you can fast charge the iPhone 8 or later to <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208137\">50% in 30 minutes</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S smartphones support Qualcomm QuickCharge 2, but can fast charge on any USB-PD power adapter.</p> <p>USB-C chargers come in various shapes and sizes rated by wattage. 18W or higher will fast charge most phones, while 30W or higher will handle tablets and smaller laptops. Some laptops need 45W or higher, with high performance machines needing above 80W.</p> <p>Quality USB-C chargers start at under \u00a320. Look out for Anker, Aukey and RavPower brands at the cheaper end or Apple\u2019s high-powered laptop chargers at the top end.</p> <h2>Ditch the cable and go wireless</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd9285697413324cfbe7440e43b14f3a9f76c5b5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd9285697413324cfbe7440e43b14f3a9f76c5b5/0_0_3678_2207/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wireless chargers come in various forms, from stands to pads, but you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money on a good one.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wireless chargers come in various forms, from stands to pads, but you don\u2019t need to spend a lot of money on a good one.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Google</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s 2019 - you probably don\u2019t need a cable at all to charge your top-end phone.

Faster wireless chargers are available including 10W and 15W. The iPhone will wirelessly charge at a maximum of 7.5W, but Huawei, Samsung and other manufacturers support up to 15W charging. Some phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the Huawei P30 Pro can even wirelessly charge other devices too.</p> <p>Quality wireless chargers start at around \u00a318.</p> <h2>USB-C adapters or cables</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af0bc8e75c8dc100be1fa178ede7f8db13695c8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af0bc8e75c8dc100be1fa178ede7f8db13695c8b/3_0_4604_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You can buy USB-C adapters, but often it\u2019s cheaper to buy a purpose made USB-C cable for the job.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You can buy USB-C adapters, but often it\u2019s cheaper to buy a purpose made USB-C cable for the job.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The brave new world of USB-C isn\u2019t just about charging.

It is just a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_connector\">standard DC plug</a> that comes in a variety of different sizes.

Education inspectors released the pictures as they announced the university had failed to get accreditation for falling short of basic academic requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of the facade that is the Peruvian university system,\u201d says Ricardo Cuenca, director of the Institute of Peruvian Studies. \u201cIt was presenting an image with nothing behind it.\u201d M\u00e1ximo Estupi\u00f1an, a spokesman for the university, has denied the trompe l\u2019oeil effect was a \u201cfalse facade.\u201d He described it as a \u201ccurtain wall, an architectural category and concept which was implemented for purely aesthetic reasons\u201d. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Estupi\u00f1an said the fake three floors were a temporary construction while work on the building continued. Such arguments may be purely academic, as Sunedu, the state body which regulates higher education standards, blocked fresh student enrollments and gave Telesup two years to shut down for good. Meanwhile, most of Telesup\u2019s 20,000-odd students will complete their studies at licensed educational institutions, according to Sunedu\u2019s chief, Martin Benavides. \u201cWe evaluate the essential conditions for a university service. The infrastructure is one of them and [the facade] is part of the reality of this university,\u201d Benavides told local media. Over recent decades, Peru\u2019s tertiary education sector has grown dramatically, and the country currently has more than 140 universities \u2013 more than four times more than in the 1980s. Most are fee-paying private institutions which do not offer degrees which would be recognized outside the country, education officials admit. During the 1980s public universities were often used as recruiting grounds by the Shining Path, a violent Maoist guerrilla group. Then in the late 1990s, the now jailed former president Alberto Fujimori passed a law promoting for-profit private universities with deregulation and tax breaks. The subsequent boom meant what was on offer for students was \u201cdisorderly, of poor quality and very fragmented\u201d, Cuenca said. \u201cPoor higher education means poor quality professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sign that a country can grow economically but fail educationally.\u201d",

Both Cineworld and Odeon now offer unlimited monthly memberships where you can watch as many films as you like. But it is the Vue cinema chain that has arguably had the most dramatic price change. In 2018 Vue slashed its ticket prices by more than 50% in some places. There are currently about 40 Vue cinemas that charge an \u201cevery film every day\u201d price of \u00a34.99. This typically applies to a 2D film in a standard seat and excludes booking fees. And in Cardiff, Vue charges just \u00a34 (in fact, Wales is one of the cheapest places to go to the cinema in the UK).

The cinema currently charges \u00a35 full price and \u00a34 concessions for most screenings. They also have \u201ccheap\u201d nights where you pay less.

The for-profit Picturedrome, a small independent chain predominantly in the south of England and Wales, has some of the lowest ticket prices in the country: at the majority of its cinemas, tickets cost between \u00a33.50 and \u00a34.50.</p> <p>The chain\u2019s managing director, Adam Cunard, took over the then-struggling Bognor Regis Picturedrome in 2007. \u201cIt was very sad. There were five people in some days,\u201d he recalls. After bringing the Grade II-listed building back to life, Cunard expanded to other rural and seaside towns such as Westgate-on-Sea in Kent and Clacton in Essex \u2013 in some cases reviving cinemas that had been closed for decades.</p> <p>Attracting people who had previously written off going to the cinema as unaffordable is just one part of his strategy. By offering cheaper tickets, Cunard and others aim to turn cinema-going into a regular habit rather than an occasional treat. After all, people are more likely to take a punt on a film if it only costs them a few pounds. And it is a strategy that seems to be working. \u201cWe have people coming to the cinema week in, week out,\u201d says Cunard.</p> <h2><strong>\u00a31 tickets and free screenings</strong></h2> <p>Many of the independents seem to have a genuine desire to make cinema accessible to all \u2013 particularly for those who would find even \u00a33.50 unaffordable.</p> <p>For example, the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle upon Tyne offers \u00a31 daytime tickets to the unemployed, refugees and asylum seekers. And at both the Cube and Hebden Bridge Picture House in West Yorkshire, asylum seekers and refugees get in for free. However, with many people housed in nearby Halifax rather than Hebden Bridge itself, the Friends of the Picture House also secured charitable funding so they could run monthly group cinema trips with transport, and sometimes lunch, provided. As an aside, Hebden Bridge Picture House also runs its young person\u2019s concession rate up to the age of 25, in recognition of the fact that many people are still finding their feet financially in their early 20s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7b8f9369dbe0ffaee69200b38cd9ff7d9e4595be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7b8f9369dbe0ffaee69200b38cd9ff7d9e4595be/0_103_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hebden Bridge Picture House, cinema and arts venue\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hebden Bridge Picture House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: West Yorkshire Images/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The desire to widen access was partly what motivated Neil Johns when he co-founded the Peckham and Nunhead Free Film Festival in 2010 (this year\u2019s takes place between 5 and 15 September). \u201cWe wanted to make everything free so that there were no barriers to people coming along,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Since then, there have been free film festivals in other London boroughs and locations including Glasgow, Weston-super-Mare and Guildford.

Miller is getting notes of leather and suede but can probably smell money too. The sought-after Nike Jordan 1s \u2013 designed by the rapper Travis Scott - are among the most coveted on StockX, a fast-growing stock exchange-style trading platform for \u201csneakerheads\u201d, who collect or trade trainers and are willing to pay in excess of \u00a31,000 for a pair.</p> <p>\u201cI blindfold test all the time,\u201d says Miller, who is one of the site\u2019s London-based staff tasked with weeding out fakes in the global trainer (or sneaker, for the Americans) resale market, which is now estimated to be worth as much as $7bn (\u00a35.5bn) a year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74d9ff210f6a697aa9b01188535342405f11d19a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74d9ff210f6a697aa9b01188535342405f11d19a/0_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 trainers, from the Kanye West range.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 trainers, from the Kanye West range.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: None</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou look for general quality of sneaker, the stitching, the smell. I tell my best authenticators to close their eyes and tell me what shoe it is.

The site\u2019s users, who are predominantly male and in their teens and twenties, have traded $1bn worth of unworn gear in the past year. The UK market is worth \u00a3200m.</p> <p>\u201cA stock market is the most efficient way to create a market price for any asset,\u201d says Josh Luber, a former IBM consultant who co-founded StockX with US billionaire Dan Gilbert four years ago. \u201cWe have brought the efficiency and transparency [of that model] to make it easier to buy products where supply and demand is constrained.\u201d</p> <p>The sneakerhead scene used to be a subculture but the internet and sites such as Instagram have forced it into the mainstream as the fashion and music worlds collide with huge social media audiences online. At the same time there has been a shift towards casual dressing across generations, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/03/athleisure-threatens-to-put-jeans-out-of-fashion-kanye\">athleisure</a> trend last week helping to propel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/jd-sports\">JD Sports Fashion</a> into<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/01/jd-sports-marks-and-spencer-ftse-100\"> the FTSE 100 index</a> of top UK companies.</p> <p>\u201cThe growth that we see today is down to the arrival of Instagram,\u201d says Luber. \u201cAll sneakerheads ever wanted to do was show off their shoes and see what other people are wearing. Brands are bringing in fashion designers and artists to make shoes: Kaws [the American artist and designer Brian Donnelly] does shoes with Nike so it crosses many different parts of culture.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c9410abad0cf5f50bfe5ec8bbf41b7026487df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c9410abad0cf5f50bfe5ec8bbf41b7026487df5/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A pair of Air Jordans at StockX.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of Air Jordans at StockX.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are no profit warnings on StockX but market forces still apply as celebrity stock rises and fall. Justin Timberlake gave the price of Air Jordan 3s a boost when he wore them to the Superbowl but the personal travails of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo made his Nikes hard to shift for a while.</p> <p>Detroit-based StockX\u2019s financial backers include Gilbert, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, and GV, the venture capital arm of Google owner Alphabet. It also has a string of celebrity investors including Marshall Mathers, better-known as Eminem, Mark Wahlberg and the supermodel Karlie Kloss. So far it has raked in $50m to fund expansion \u2013 Luber says more fundraising rounds will follow.</p> <p>StockX is currently focused on expansion in Europe; it recently opened an office in London as well as the region\u2019s first authentication centre, to ensure the products being sold are genuine, on a west London industrial estate.</p> <p>\u201cLondon is the centre of the European sneaker world \u2026 as a marketplace we have to make it a local experience and get the product to people fast,\u201d says Luber, who with his combat trousers and orange-soled trainers looks dressed for a rap battle rather than meetings with City suits. The 41-year-old owns 400 pairs of trainers but says it is a tally that in the \u201cpantheon of big sneaker collections doesn\u2019t even register\u201d.</p> <p>The London depot \u2013 another site four times its size will open soon in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands \u2013 is the focal point for trade in the region. Each day several lorry loads of shoes and clothing are dropped at the back door for staff to vet, with the mountain of stock gradually sifted through the hands of an expert such as Miller before it can be okayed and sent on to the buyer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab435d5b68bc8df324bb2b662df4f08bc520f9a7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab435d5b68bc8df324bb2b662df4f08bc520f9a7/0_167_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Checking for fakes at the StockX site.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Checking for fakes at the StockX site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The average seller is a sole trader \u2013 literally \u2013 who has queued for new shoe releases or taken a punt on styles they think will increase in value. Sales attract a 3% payment processing charge and a transaction fee of 9.5%. But the shopper base is increasingly mainstream. \u201cIt started with core sneakerheads,\u201d says Luber. \u201cBut now it\u2019s about people who may have just bought their last pair of shoes at JD Sports or Footlocker but would never wade through eBay listings. The retail and resale market has started to blur together.\u201d</p> <p>In the London depot there are boxes of trainers piled to the ceiling but the reality is few of the trainers will ever be worn, as traders speculate that their value will increase. Miller, a collector with hundreds of pairs, confesses he has bought eight pairs of the Travis Scott Nikes \u2013 which stand out thanks to the reversal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nike\">Nike</a>\u2019s famous swoosh on the side \u2013 but he wouldn\u2019t even contemplate trying them on. \u201cI\u2019m saving them for when they go up in price. I wear cheap sneakers myself, $200 max. For me to put $1,000 sneakers on my feet \u2013 I can\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <h2>Hot shoes on StockX</h2> <p><strong>Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3934fe5b62fa788300f1a0602d1772b10f251c2b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3934fe5b62fa788300f1a0602d1772b10f251c2b/0_0_750_1334/562.jpg\" alt=\"The price for a pair of Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott on StockX\" width=\"562\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The price for a pair of Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott on StockX</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StockX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of the most hyped and anticipated releases of the year.

      "bodyText": "Sniffing strangers\u2019 trainers for a living sounds like a bad job, but standing at his work station Matt Miller is inhaling a Nike Air Jordan shoe with the enthusiasm of a sommelier. Mercifully, the shoe has never been worn. Miller is getting notes of leather and suede but can probably smell money too. The sought-after Nike Jordan 1s \u2013 designed by the rapper Travis Scott - are among the most coveted on StockX, a fast-growing stock exchange-style trading platform for \u201csneakerheads\u201d, who collect or trade trainers and are willing to pay in excess of \u00a31,000 for a pair. \u201cI blindfold test all the time,\u201d says Miller, who is one of the site\u2019s London-based staff tasked with weeding out fakes in the global trainer (or sneaker, for the Americans) resale market, which is now estimated to be worth as much as $7bn (\u00a35.5bn) a year. \u201cYou look for general quality of sneaker, the stitching, the smell. I tell my best authenticators to close their eyes and tell me what shoe it is. Every sneaker has a unique smell.\u201d At a time when many traditional fashion retailers are struggling to appeal to fickle young shoppers, the major sports brands have struck gold by teaming up with tastemakers such as Pharrell Williams and Kanye West to release limited-edition footwear collections. West\u2019s latest Yeezy shoes are so sought after that British shoppers were queuing in the early hours of Friday to get their hands on the latest iteration, which cost \u00a3180. With demand outstripping supply for these highly prized products, StockX bills itself as a \u201cstock market for things\u201d, enabling individuals to speculate on the most sought after shoes \u2013 and hoodies too \u2013 as if they are shares in a quoted company. The site\u2019s users, who are predominantly male and in their teens and twenties, have traded $1bn worth of unworn gear in the past year. The UK market is worth \u00a3200m. \u201cA stock market is the most efficient way to create a market price for any asset,\u201d says Josh Luber, a former IBM consultant who co-founded StockX with US billionaire Dan Gilbert four years ago. \u201cWe have brought the efficiency and transparency [of that model] to make it easier to buy products where supply and demand is constrained.\u201d The sneakerhead scene used to be a subculture but the internet and sites such as Instagram have forced it into the mainstream as the fashion and music worlds collide with huge social media audiences online. At the same time there has been a shift towards casual dressing across generations, with the athleisure trend last week helping to propel JD Sports Fashion into the FTSE 100 index of top UK companies. \u201cThe growth that we see today is down to the arrival of Instagram,\u201d says Luber. \u201cAll sneakerheads ever wanted to do was show off their shoes and see what other people are wearing. Brands are bringing in fashion designers and artists to make shoes: Kaws [the American artist and designer Brian Donnelly] does shoes with Nike so it crosses many different parts of culture.\u201d There are no profit warnings on StockX but market forces still apply as celebrity stock rises and fall. Justin Timberlake gave the price of Air Jordan 3s a boost when he wore them to the Superbowl but the personal travails of footballer Cristiano Ronaldo made his Nikes hard to shift for a while. Detroit-based StockX\u2019s financial backers include Gilbert, owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team, and GV, the venture capital arm of Google owner Alphabet. It also has a string of celebrity investors including Marshall Mathers, better-known as Eminem, Mark Wahlberg and the supermodel Karlie Kloss. So far it has raked in $50m to fund expansion \u2013 Luber says more fundraising rounds will follow. StockX is currently focused on expansion in Europe; it recently opened an office in London as well as the region\u2019s first authentication centre, to ensure the products being sold are genuine, on a west London industrial estate. \u201cLondon is the centre of the European sneaker world \u2026 as a marketplace we have to make it a local experience and get the product to people fast,\u201d says Luber, who with his combat trousers and orange-soled trainers looks dressed for a rap battle rather than meetings with City suits. The 41-year-old owns 400 pairs of trainers but says it is a tally that in the \u201cpantheon of big sneaker collections doesn\u2019t even register\u201d. The London depot \u2013 another site four times its size will open soon in Eindhoven, in the Netherlands \u2013 is the focal point for trade in the region. Each day several lorry loads of shoes and clothing are dropped at the back door for staff to vet, with the mountain of stock gradually sifted through the hands of an expert such as Miller before it can be okayed and sent on to the buyer. The average seller is a sole trader \u2013 literally \u2013 who has queued for new shoe releases or taken a punt on styles they think will increase in value. Sales attract a 3% payment processing charge and a transaction fee of 9.5%. But the shopper base is increasingly mainstream. \u201cIt started with core sneakerheads,\u201d says Luber. \u201cBut now it\u2019s about people who may have just bought their last pair of shoes at JD Sports or Footlocker but would never wade through eBay listings. The retail and resale market has started to blur together.\u201d In the London depot there are boxes of trainers piled to the ceiling but the reality is few of the trainers will ever be worn, as traders speculate that their value will increase. Miller, a collector with hundreds of pairs, confesses he has bought eight pairs of the Travis Scott Nikes \u2013 which stand out thanks to the reversal of Nike\u2019s famous swoosh on the side \u2013 but he wouldn\u2019t even contemplate trying them on. \u201cI\u2019m saving them for when they go up in price. I wear cheap sneakers myself, $200 max. For me to put $1,000 sneakers on my feet \u2013 I can\u2019t do it.\u201d Hot shoes on StockX Jordan 1 Retro High Travis Scott One of the most hyped and anticipated releases of the year. Travis released around 5,000 early pairs in to the market on the day of the Super Bowl and a similar amount on his birthday. Early pairs spiked at almost \u00a32,100 on StockX because they weren\u2019t released to the general public, making them extremely sought after. The market has now settled down with smaller sizes reaching around \u00a3900-\u00a31,300 with bigger sizes from \u00a3550-\u00a3800. Nike LD Waffle Sacai Blue Multi Sacai, a luxury Japanese fashion brand, collaborated with Nike to release the Waffle. Early pairs traded for \u00a3800-\u00a31,500 on StockX, which people were prepared to pay because they loved the shoe and weren\u2019t sure if it was ever going to be released more widely. The sneaker has now settled in price from \u00a3240 to \u00a3350 depending on size as they were eventually released in quantity. Adidas Yeezy Boost 350 v2 TRFRM Kanye West has been a huge influence in the sneaker industry for a long time now and his Yeezy True Form was particularly sought after as it was an EU only release \u2013 driving demand for them in Asia and North America.

Many women at the deeper end of the shade spectrum assume it\u2019s for others, those at the pale end worry it will make them orange, while those anywhere in the middle are frequently so fearful of inexpert technique and tiger-striped cheeks that they buy once and use never. Which is why I say, not at all lightly, that <strong><a href=\"https://www.boots.com/beauty/luxury-beauty-skincare/luxury-beauty-makeup/becca-sunlit-bronzer-sun-kissed-glow-10263280\" title=\"\">Becca Sunlit Bronzer</a></strong> (\u00a327), is now legitimately my favourite bronzing powder for everyone.</p> <p>Here\u2019s why. It\u2019s neither matte nor glittery. The barely perceptible trace of glimmering iridescence is just enough to make skin appear healthy and vital without being remotely spangly or unnatural. The colours are few but cover a wide range \u2013 my shade is Bali Sands, which I\u2019ve worn daily since February. It\u2019s the perfectly flattering golden brown for anyone who thinks themselves too white for realistic bronzing. Maui Nights is an unusual, yet tonally correct, deep, burnished bronze, that illuminates dark brown skin sublimely (bronzer\u2019s job is not to darken, but to warm). The coverage is sheer \u2013 no chance of muddy stripes \u2013 but lasting, and this clearer pigment hides novice application errors. Oh, and it makes a fast, easy eyeshadow (fluff over lids to just beyond the crease). It is also cruelty-free.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/may/25/the-best-sunscreens-for-the-most-sensitive-of-skins\">The best sunscreens for the most sensitive of skins | Sali Hughes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As utterly perfect as the Becca bronzer is, I know from experience that I\u2019ll have lost many of you at the mere mention of glimmer.

      "bodyText": "Bronzing powder. So misunderstood. Many women at the deeper end of the shade spectrum assume it\u2019s for others, those at the pale end worry it will make them orange, while those anywhere in the middle are frequently so fearful of inexpert technique and tiger-striped cheeks that they buy once and use never. Which is why I say, not at all lightly, that Becca Sunlit Bronzer (\u00a327), is now legitimately my favourite bronzing powder for everyone. Here\u2019s why. It\u2019s neither matte nor glittery. The barely perceptible trace of glimmering iridescence is just enough to make skin appear healthy and vital without being remotely spangly or unnatural. The colours are few but cover a wide range \u2013 my shade is Bali Sands, which I\u2019ve worn daily since February. It\u2019s the perfectly flattering golden brown for anyone who thinks themselves too white for realistic bronzing. Maui Nights is an unusual, yet tonally correct, deep, burnished bronze, that illuminates dark brown skin sublimely (bronzer\u2019s job is not to darken, but to warm). The coverage is sheer \u2013 no chance of muddy stripes \u2013 but lasting, and this clearer pigment hides novice application errors. Oh, and it makes a fast, easy eyeshadow (fluff over lids to just beyond the crease). It is also cruelty-free. As utterly perfect as the Becca bronzer is, I know from experience that I\u2019ll have lost many of you at the mere mention of glimmer. Matte seems less risky. I don\u2019t agree, since it\u2019s usually more pigmented and defined. But if I must go there, I\u2019ll divide the best into skin tones, since few brands cater for all at the same level. If your skin is olive, brown or black, Huda Beauty Tantour (\u00a326) is terrific. The colours are thoughtfully conceived and complement not only skin colour, but differing undertones. They all have serious pigment in common and so a light touch is essential if you would like a sunny glow rather than sculpted tan, but the upside is these bronzers last all day, even on oily skins. Unless obvious is your thing (and hats off to you), Tantour\u2019s offering for Caucasian skin is limited, which makes a novel change. For the pale and shimmer-averse, I suggest e.l.f. Cosmetics\u2019 bargain Bronzer Palette, which is only \u00a37.50 for four flattering tones that swirl together to make up a convincing glow. In all cases, take a fat, fluffy brush and buff over bronzer in a figure three (temples, cheeks, jawline) on your right side, mirroring it on your left.",

But as Vivian puts it, \u201cexile in New York is no exile at all\u201d. The city is all glamour and excitement, with a hysterical edge familiar to readers in a contemporary world on the brink of global crisis.</p> <p>Sent to live at her bohemian Aunt Peg\u2019s down-at-heel mid-town theatre, The Lily, Vivian falls headlong in lust with a colourful world that has little in common with her privileged Wasp upbringing.</p> <p>Worldly showgirl Celia Ray, streetwise leading man Anthony Roccella, grande dame Edna Parker Watson and her beautiful-but-dim actor husband Arthur, along with Hollywood wheeler-dealer Billy Buell, are like nothing and no one Vivian has ever encountered before. She\u2019s not slow to cast off the moral and emotional shackles of her strait-laced, buttoned-down upbringing, embarking on a series of affairs and acquiring for herself a very different sort of education from the one that her parents would have deemed appropriate.</p> <p>If this all sounds like something straight out of vaudeville, it is. And intentionally so. This is a work of historical fiction, and Gilbert\u2019s prose, while not immaculate, zings with the mood of the era. In fact, like Gilbert\u2019s previous novel, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/06/signature-all-things-elizabeth-gilbert-review\" title=\"\"><em>A Signature of All Things</em></a>, it\u2019s so true to life in places \u2013 including real historical figures in the story \u2013 that it occasionally feels like pastiche.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d0763a3c9225be7e8a98934afa3e5ea369a1eb80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0763a3c9225be7e8a98934afa3e5ea369a1eb80/397_253_1631_1781/916.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Gilbert\" width=\"916\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Gilbert</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Gilbert is nothing if not emotionally intuitive, and while <em>City of Girls</em> is unquestionably a sexy, glamorous romp, its similarities with vaudeville end there. The plot bristles with moral intent: Vivian\u2019s fall, when it inevitably comes, is complete and damning and utterly gendered, its repercussions shadowing the rest of her life. Yet Gilbert wouldn\u2019t be the woman she is \u2013 one who \u201cspoke her truth\u201d and left her husband to embark on a relationship with her female best friend, even as the friend was dying from pancreatic cancer \u2013 if she was to allow her female characters to be destroyed by society\u2019s disapproval. And it\u2019s at this point that the novel\u2019s true heart is revealed.</p> <p>Shame and scandal have taken on renewed meaning in the internet age: it\u2019s almost becoming a cliche to assess creative work in the context of #MeToo, Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and co. At the same time, it\u2019s impossible to divorce artists from the climate in which they work, and Gilbert has been vocal in her concern that women\u2019s sexual agency, always under threat, is particularly at risk right now. \u201cWe\u2019re at this incredibly explosive moment of female anger and resistance, in terms of abuse against women,\u201d she has said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see lost [is] the idea of women pursuing sex because it\u2019s something they want to have.\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert has long since severed her bond with shame \u2013 and thank goodness. In other hands, this novel could have had all the adventure and enjoyment, but none of the depth; instead she makes it into a glorious, multilayered, emotionally astute celebration of womanhood.</p> <p>It would be easy to dismiss <em>City of Girls</em> as joyous escapism, and God knows there\u2019s little enough of that around right now. But look more closely and what you\u2019ll see is an eloquently persuasive treatise on the judgment and punishment of women, and a heartfelt call to reclaim female sexual agency. \u201cAt some point in a woman\u2019s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,\u201d says Vivian as she looks back on her life. \u201cAfter that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Gilbert is right.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sam Baker\u2019s The Woman Who Ran is published by HarperFiction.

But as Vivian puts it, \u201cexile in New York is no exile at all\u201d. The city is all glamour and excitement, with a hysterical edge familiar to readers in a contemporary world on the brink of global crisis. Sent to live at her bohemian Aunt Peg\u2019s down-at-heel mid-town theatre, The Lily, Vivian falls headlong in lust with a colourful world that has little in common with her privileged Wasp upbringing. Worldly showgirl Celia Ray, streetwise leading man Anthony Roccella, grande dame Edna Parker Watson and her beautiful-but-dim actor husband Arthur, along with Hollywood wheeler-dealer Billy Buell, are like nothing and no one Vivian has ever encountered before. She\u2019s not slow to cast off the moral and emotional shackles of her strait-laced, buttoned-down upbringing, embarking on a series of affairs and acquiring for herself a very different sort of education from the one that her parents would have deemed appropriate. If this all sounds like something straight out of vaudeville, it is. And intentionally so. This is a work of historical fiction, and Gilbert\u2019s prose, while not immaculate, zings with the mood of the era. In fact, like Gilbert\u2019s previous novel, A Signature of All Things, it\u2019s so true to life in places \u2013 including real historical figures in the story \u2013 that it occasionally feels like pastiche. But Gilbert is nothing if not emotionally intuitive, and while City of Girls is unquestionably a sexy, glamorous romp, its similarities with vaudeville end there. The plot bristles with moral intent: Vivian\u2019s fall, when it inevitably comes, is complete and damning and utterly gendered, its repercussions shadowing the rest of her life. Yet Gilbert wouldn\u2019t be the woman she is \u2013 one who \u201cspoke her truth\u201d and left her husband to embark on a relationship with her female best friend, even as the friend was dying from pancreatic cancer \u2013 if she was to allow her female characters to be destroyed by society\u2019s disapproval. And it\u2019s at this point that the novel\u2019s true heart is revealed. Shame and scandal have taken on renewed meaning in the internet age: it\u2019s almost becoming a cliche to assess creative work in the context of #MeToo, Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and co. At the same time, it\u2019s impossible to divorce artists from the climate in which they work, and Gilbert has been vocal in her concern that women\u2019s sexual agency, always under threat, is particularly at risk right now. \u201cWe\u2019re at this incredibly explosive moment of female anger and resistance, in terms of abuse against women,\u201d she has said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see lost [is] the idea of women pursuing sex because it\u2019s something they want to have.\u201d Gilbert has long since severed her bond with shame \u2013 and thank goodness. In other hands, this novel could have had all the adventure and enjoyment, but none of the depth; instead she makes it into a glorious, multilayered, emotionally astute celebration of womanhood. It would be easy to dismiss City of Girls as joyous escapism, and God knows there\u2019s little enough of that around right now. But look more closely and what you\u2019ll see is an eloquently persuasive treatise on the judgment and punishment of women, and a heartfelt call to reclaim female sexual agency. \u201cAt some point in a woman\u2019s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,\u201d says Vivian as she looks back on her life. \u201cAfter that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Gilbert is right. \u2022 Sam Baker\u2019s The Woman Who Ran is published by HarperFiction.

      "bodyText": "Reese Witherspoon has been sharing snaps of her Big Little Lies castmates \u2013 and, possibly, actual mates \u2013 on Instagram for months now. Her 17.8 million followers have seen them going bowling, catching a movie and goofing around for \u201cGalentine\u2019s Day\u201d. Last week, however, came the squad-shot supreme: Witherspoon, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Laura Dern, Shailene Woodley, Nicole Kidman and new addition Meryl Streep arm-in-arm and laughing it up, as they posed for photographers at the NYC season two premiere. Her caption read: \u201cThe power of sisterhood and friendship is limitless! So proud to work with these remarkable ladies. Can\u2019t wait to share Season 2 of @biglittlies with y\u2019all! June 9th on @hbo\u201d. That down-home \u201cy\u2019all\u201d, the girl power platitudes and all of it wrapped up with a seamless plug? To say Witherspoon\u2019s Insta is \u201con brand\u201d hardly begins to cover it. Big Little Lies\u2019 movie-star cast has always been a draw, but since debuting on US television in 2017, it has positioned itself within a sorority of shows that not only centre on female friendship, but depict these relationships as the ultimate in glamorous empowerment. In Amazon Prime Video\u2019s The Bold Type, junior employees of a Cosmopolitan-like women\u2019s magazine love, laugh and like each other\u2019s posts in an idealised version of New York. In BBC Three\u2019s Clique, a group of students in Edinburgh experience an accelerated version of complex, intriguing female friendship. The settings differ but the message is the same one we have been absorbing since Carrie Bradshaw first got splashed on a Manhattan sidewalk: you may have the adoring family, the fulfilling career and the designer wardrobe, but who are you without your girls? And what Sex and the City originated has now been perfected: Big Little Lies pulls off glossy TV feminism with all the type-A aplomb of Witherspoon\u2019s character, Madeline, organising a PTA fundraiser. You would be forgiven for assuming this was a show about something entirely different. The first season was adapted from Liane Moriarty\u2019s 2014 novel by Ally McBeal creator David E Kelley and told the story of a murder investigation in a wealthy Californian town. By the end of the first season, however, that mystery element had been sidelined, and in the opening episodes of season two, it\u2019s barely even paid lip service to. When we return to Monterey, on the first day of a new school year, the lie told by the central characters doesn\u2019t seem quite so \u201cbig little\u201d any more. The events of last season are important, but mainly because of how they threaten to drive a wedge between the five women, and much less because of any palpable anxiety over the police or Perry\u2019s mother, Mary Louise (Streep), discovering the truth about his death. Meanwhile, season two\u2019s stabs at social commentary are tellingly facile. There is Bonnie\u2019s visiting mother (Crystal Fox) briefly skirting around whether her daughter\u2019s feelings of isolation might be connected to her being the only black person in town. Or the line from Madeline\u2019s daughter, Abigail (Kathryn Newton), about college kids \u201cmulling a sex change\u201d. It\u2019s the kind of dismissive jibe that a grumpy middle-aged dad would come up with, and sounds odd coming from the mouth of a supposedly cool and conscientious teen. Elsewhere, the dialogue is as quippy and emotionally astute as ever, but the best scenes aren\u2019t those that further the plot; they\u2019re those in which the women are together in any configuration: bonding, or bitching, or bonding-through-bitching. And if you are not here for those central relationships, then you must be here for all their luxe lifestyle trappings. Celeste, Renata and Madeline\u2019s beachfront mansions have been the subject of numerous property porn write-ups in interiors magazines, while Monterey itself has become an increasingly popular destination, much to the delight of the city\u2019s tourism officials, who have devised special tours. The opening credits sequence, featuring the five women driving central California\u2019s spectacular coastal routes is clearly also a boon for Sky Atlantic\u2019s official show sponsors, car manufacturers Volvo. There\u2019s more: the season one soundtrack album reached No 1 on the US\u2019s Americana/Folk chart, and this season, HBO is partnering with $215-a-month, women-only private members\u2019 club The Wing on screening events and a \u201ccustom retail capsule\u201d comprising items from female-owned clothing and accessories brands.

      "body": "<p>As Twitter became too angry and the news cycle too tense, it is no accident that I fell face first into the unfettered joy of podcasts \u2013 light, illuminating chat and people enthusing about their passions. I listen to them in the dark, just as I used to listen to DJ Tom Ferrie on BBC Radio Scotland in the 80s. There is something so soothing about a warm duvet, a blacked out room and a link between you and some strangers who are on your wavelength. Now my radio is the iPhone under my pillow.</p> <p>I find that podcasts are so personal, they are actually quite difficult to \u201csell\u201d to a friend. For example, I love Something Rhymes With Purple presented by Gyles Brandreth and Susie Dent. It\u2019s a podcast about semantics. No, come back. It\u2019s brilliant! Here are two people who love language and take enormous pleasure in discussing how \u201cscurryfunge\u201d means to rush about tidying before guests arrive, or how \u201cpandiculating\u201d is stretching and yawning at the same time. Brandreth, of course, is also a hive of royal anecdotes and eccentric off-topic chat. I have loved him since I was a little girl when he wrote practical joke books, teaching children how to make an apple-pie bed. Now, I can listen in as he and Dent discuss their student days and family lives.</p> <p>As a Radio 4 presenter, I often think double-act, chitchat podcasts like these capture the essence of how studios feel before recording starts. Before people begin to read scripts, self-edit or worry they are not keeping things broad enough. With podcasts the hosts can be as obscure or gorgeously self-indulgent as they desire. Only the most cynical podcasters tailor their content for mass-market numbers; the best ones have a \u201cThis is us: like it, or shove off\u201d attitude.</p> <p>Dear Joan And Jericha, with Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis, is so wilfully filthy and dark that I think twice before sharing it with friends. Here the world\u2019s worst, least sympathetic agony aunts take on bleak sexual problems, such as what to do if your partner only wants to kick your vagina with his athlete\u2019s foot-ridden toes while he reads the rugby results. It makes Davis\u2019s previous television output look like The Good Life. It is wholly strange, clever on a dozen levels and makes me gasp for air laughing.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been a guest on Fortunately... with Fi Glover and Jane Garvey, which was marvellous as I was a big fan, and I can confirm that this podcast really is just two friends chuntering waspishly about fellow BBC talent and their own lives. They don\u2019t set out to be cool, shocking or candid, and by default they are all three.</p> <p>My very favourite podcast has one host, but a changing roster of guests. On Looks Unfamiliar, Tim Worthington and friends ruminate over obscure things from the 70s and 80s that they remember, but, vitally, no one else seems to. (Not Spacehoppers or Um Bongo \u2013 more like Big Daddy\u2019s thwarted Saturday morning show, or the Boots Global Collection makeup range). I do not know a single other soul who listens to it, and I\u2019m happy that way.</p> <p>Podcasts can be far ruder, more irreverent, sillier or unfocused than any other medium. They can be uploaded to a global platform sounding like a bit of a dog\u2019s dinner, the presenter streaming with cold and the sound levels thoroughly wonky. As a listener, I care little. I know these teams are doing this mainly for love and for the happiness of being heard. And we get it for free \u2013 normal 21st-century rules and expectations do not apply here.</p> <p>It\u2019s exciting. We live in interesting times. If I ever get out of bed, I may possibly see them. <strong>Grace Dent</strong></p> <h2><strong>\u2018There is probably a vagina in every episode\u2019 Dear Joan And Jericha</strong></h2> <p>Actors and writers Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine have been friends for more than 20 years, working together often. Mainstays of the British comedy scene, they are probably best known for the black comedy Nighty Night. Their podcast, <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/dear-joan-and-jericha-julia-davis-and-vicki-pepperdine\">Dear Joan And Jericha</a>, in which the duo play local radio agony aunts who tackle listeners\u2019 sex, life and relationship issues in an entirely inappropriate manner, became a near instant word-of-mouth hit when it was launched a year ago, and went on to win best comedy at the 2019 British Podcast Awards.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The characters emerged. We didn\u2019t want anyone to tell us what to do, which is what happens in TV</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Series one (a snappy eight 20-minute episodes) calls to mind the absurd sex tips from women\u2019s magazines, mixed in with your mum\u2019s most insensitive and outrageous off-hand comments. In true Davis and Pepperdine form, it is filthy. It\u2019s not just the hilarious improvised asides that have won the podcast a multitude of fans, but the way it openly addresses messy sex, bodily functions and anatomy, as well as emphasising that it\u2019s not always men who are responsible for exacerbating women\u2019s insecurities.</p> <p><strong>Why did you want to start a podcast?</strong></p> <p><strong>Vicki:</strong> Well, we didn\u2019t even think about a podcast in the beginning. We were just playing around with ideas.</p> <p><strong>Julia:</strong> The characters emerged. We didn\u2019t want anyone to tell us what to do, which is what happens in TV.</p> <p><strong>V:</strong> <em>[To Julia]<strong> </strong></em>I think you suggested a podcast. And I didn\u2019t really know about podcasts. It\u2019s a generational thing, I guess. Then we did it and people said, \u201cYou need to advertise it.\u201d And we said, \u201cShall we just see if people find it?\u201d \u2013 and they did.</p> <p><strong>What are your red lines \u2013 where wouldn\u2019t you go?</strong></p> <p><strong>J:</strong> It comes down to the tone of it. You can go almost anywhere. But you can listen back and go: \u201cThat\u2019s actually really sick and distressing.\u201d It\u2019s whether or not you are still finding it funny.</p> <p><strong>V:</strong> I think there\u2019s something about talking very openly about what, for years, has been a sort of no-go, gynae area \u2013 young women in particular seem to be emboldened by it.</p> <p><strong>Who are your podcast/radio heroes?</strong></p> <p><strong>V:</strong> I listen to My Dad Wrote A Porno. I think that\u2019s great.</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> Derek and Clive. I\u2019m a massive Peter Cook fan. Obviously they\u2019re not podcasters. I think, similarly to Vicki, I didn\u2019t listen to a lot of podcasts. On a train I always just want to look at people and listen to their conversations.</p> <p><strong>What has been your favourite episode to date?</strong></p> <p><strong>J:</strong> That\u2019s a really hard one. The godson one we quite liked.<br> I certainly can\u2019t remember whole episodes. We like it when we get a bit carried away describing men. Going into the detail of their physicality.</p> <p><strong>V:</strong> Inappropriate appraisals. We try to group the subjects, so there\u2019s not three vaginas in every episode.</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> Although there probably is a vagina in every episode.</p> <p><strong>Is there such a thing as an overshare?</strong></p> <p><strong>J:</strong> I would say no.</p> <p><strong>V:</strong> I don\u2019t think we could ever overshare with one another. It\u2019s a bond of trust.</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> I would say that, with any really close friend, you should be able to say anything. Whereas our parents\u2019 generation \u2013 I\u2019m sure my mum, who is no longer here, didn\u2019t have anything like that. And that must be quite horrible. Because you want someone to say, \u201cI get things.\u201d But we\u2019ve definitely recorded things that we think, \u201cThat\u2019s gone sick in a way we don\u2019t find funny.\u201d</p> <p><strong>V:</strong> We don\u2019t censor ourselves when recording, and then sometimes it\u2019s come out in a way that might be misinterpreted. So we edit.</p> <p><strong>When can we expect the new series to be out?</strong></p> <p><strong>V:</strong> We are towards the end of recording it, so we don\u2019t know exactly yet. But it will happen. That\u2019s as precise as we can be. We record it in Julia\u2019s kitchen. We thought it was going to be just for us, and it turns out people like it.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We gained a reputation as a pair of wisecracking broads\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04x5pd7/episodes/downloads\">Fortunately...</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95dfdb1d28b619bf2e7fdf4e186107800bde0062\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95dfdb1d28b619bf2e7fdf4e186107800bde0062/79_401_3541_4426/800.jpg\" alt=\"Fi Glover (left) and Jane Garvey, hosts of Fortunately...\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fi Glover (left) and Jane Garvey, hosts of Fortunately... photographed at this year\u2019s British Podcast awards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Broadcasters Jane Garvey and Fi Glover are the co-hosts of Radio 4\u2019s hit podcast Fortunately... Each week they share musings on their lives, from pet deaths and garden hose repairs to the trouble with HRT patches, before being joined by a radio, TV or podcast star such as political journalist Laura Kuenssberg or actor and comedian London Hughes. It\u2019s like sitting in on a tipsy conversation in a BBC green room.</p> <p>Radio 4 listeners will be familiar with both hosts \u2013 Garvey presents Women\u2019s Hour and Glover The Listening Project \u2013 but the podcast is far more intimate than the station\u2019s usual output, earning it a devoted fanbase.<br></p> <p><strong>What is the story of your friendship?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jane:</strong> I knew of Fi for a while before we met. We both worked at 5 Live but I avoided her. I didn\u2019t like her because I was quite jealous. I thought Fi was a bit of a metropolitan know-it-all. But I knew she was good.</p> <p><strong>Fi:</strong> Well, I\u2019ve always loved and admired Jane. We worked in the same station but were at different ends of the day. Then we hosted the Radio Festival together in 2013. We just had such a laugh.</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> There\u2019s a low bar set for women being funny, so I think the fact that we didn\u2019t need scripts and were moderately amusing was enough to gain us a reputation as a pair of wisecracking broads. Eventually, we recorded a pilot.</p> <p><strong>What can you get away with on the podcast that you can\u2019t on the radio?</strong></p> <p><strong>F:</strong> Quite a lot actually. They\u2019d never let us take the piss out of each other if we were doing the Today programme together.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Podcasting zigs and zags all over the place, and I think that suits the way lots of women talk to their friends</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>J:</strong> Not much joshery on that show is there?</p> <p><strong>F:</strong> That\u2019s the joy of podcasts. There\u2019s a very clearly defined structure to a radio show. Podcasting zigs and zags all over the place, and I think that suits the way lots of women talk to their friends.</p> <p><strong>Did you expect the show to become so popular?</strong></p> <p><strong>J:</strong> Yes, we were expecting massive success. Absolutely massive.</p> <p><strong>F:</strong> Come on, let\u2019s leave it Jane.</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> OK, yes, sorry. To be perfectly honest, I\u2019m angry that I didn\u2019t spot the obvious gap in the market. We talk about serious things, but we also talk utter shit, as you do with your female friends down the pub. The fact that no one spotted that\u2019s what women wanted \u2013 because for years, women had to put up with just men talking at them \u2013 is almost a failure of radio.</p> <p><strong>Who is your dream guest to have on the show?</strong></p> <p><strong>F:</strong> I\u2019d do Debbie Harry.</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> Deborah, she prefers. I know because she was on Women\u2019s Hour. I couldn\u2019t speak, I was agog, one of the worst interviews of my life.</p> <p><strong>F:</strong> Was she worth it?</p> <p><strong>J:</strong> I don\u2019t know, because I couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to ask her. So yes, I could make amends for that terrible interview.</p> <p><strong>Do you show different personalities in the podcasts?</strong></p> <p><strong>J:</strong> I\u2019m substantially more restrained on the Hour. On the podcast we give away more of our real selves. Like that I\u2019m a hopeless case, a nervous wreck, I\u2019m riddled with anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, single.</p> <p><strong>You have become these unlikely role models\u2026</strong></p> <p><strong>J:</strong> Unlikely! Seems a bit harsh but OK, I really don\u2019t mind. <em>[To Fi] </em>She\u2019s younger than us, isn\u2019t she?</p> <p><strong>F:</strong> I don\u2019t think either of us would say we\u2019re role models but we\u2019re working women who have managed to produce families in various shapes and sizes. There\u2019s nothing perfect about either of our lives \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s refreshing.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018I\u2019m not a representative of Islam.

It is now in its second series; each week they are joined by a special guest (model Munroe Bergdorf, comedian Nish Kumar and singer Grace Carter have all made appearances) covering topics such as polyamory, dating as a Muslim, self-care and body positivity.</p> <p>The joy of the show lies in the duo\u2019s rapport. If it sounds like listening to a conversation between old friends over a cup of tea, that\u2019s because it pretty much is \u2013 the young women used to work together in banking. Azmat went on to become a standup comedian, and was spotted by the BBC. They asked her to propose a co-host for a possible podcast, and she knew just the person to call.</p> <p><strong>Why do you record in a cafe?</strong></p> <p><strong>Monty:</strong> For access to food.</p> <p><strong>Sadia:</strong> So it\u2019s less formal and more impromptu. We don\u2019t want to sound presentery.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> We\u2019re not broadcasters by trade, so a studio would make us feel like it\u2019s work. But it doesn\u2019t feel like work when we catch up in a coffee house and have a chinwag.</p> <p><strong>Monty, you regularly speak frankly about sex. Why do you feel so passionately about doing this?</strong></p> <p><strong>M:</strong> Among my friends I am the one who speaks most graphically about sex. It winds me up that it\u2019s OK for men to enjoy sex and share their experiences. But if a woman does so she\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d. I don\u2019t subscribe to that narrative and I want to encourage young people to understand what turns us on. In fact, I want all people to do that \u2013 I am pretty sure I have some aunties who don\u2019t know where their clitoris is and some uncles who haven\u2019t found it. We\u2019re all discussing mental health at the minute; well, a good shag works wonders.</p> <p><strong>You still work at an investment bank \u2013 have the two worlds collided?</strong></p> <p><strong>M:</strong> When we first started the podcast, I used to catch the train home with our chief operating officer, and of course we\u2019d talk. I told him about the show and he promoted it on the office newsletters, even though I\u2019d just spoken to Sadia about how I\u2019d given someone a blowjob.</p> <p><strong>Sadia, you\u2019re a Muslim woman with a podcast that discusses sex. Has this made you the subject of criticism from the community?</strong></p> <p><strong>S:</strong> Not much. Although I did recently write an article (\u201cHorny Muslim women like me aren\u2019t supposed to exist during Ramadan\u201d) and got a couple of \u201cyou\u2019re going to burn in hell\u201d type of messages. All I said in the article is that trying to keep sex and sexuality hush-hush is not good.</p> <p>I do like challenging the image that Muslim women are all covered up, repressed and don\u2019t enjoy sex. I provide balance. But I\u2019m not a representative of Islam. I\u2019m just me.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> We\u2019ve grown up in cultures that tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that,\u201d but we live in a country where we\u2019re a mishmash of cultures and you can find what\u2019s right for you.</p> <p><strong>S:</strong> The pressure isn\u2019t fair. I\u2019m tired of being a brown person who is not allowed to fail, and has to be perfect to everyone all the time, when people are fluid, and who they are and what they need changes.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m interested in the idea that being mediocre as a woman of colour is a revolutionary act</strong></p> <p><strong>S:</strong> Yes! It reminds me of something Chris Rock said. On his street he lives with Jay-Z, one of the most successful rappers in the world, and Mary J Blige, one of the most successful singers in the world. And his white neighbour is a dentist. It would be great to not have to work twice as hard.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> We shouldn\u2019t settle for mediocre, though.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We should be allowed to discuss failure. On our podcast we do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>S:</strong> I guess it\u2019s more about failure. As an Asian child I wasn\u2019t allowed to get Cs and Ds. I had to get As.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> Right. We should be allowed to discuss failure. On our podcast we do.</p> <p><strong>S:</strong> And without doom and gloom.

A typical episode might flit between international politics and celebrity news, all the while discussing the presenters\u2019 own lives as young men navigating sex, family and friendships.</p> <p>They also act as agony uncles to their listeners, who send in dilemmas for the trio to solve, and the conversation continues online under the hashtag #3ShotsofTequila. They have created a dedicated community that over the last three years has helped them sell out Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, tour international music festivals, and land themselves an exclusive streaming deal with Spotify.</p> <p><strong>Why do you think the podcast is so popular?</strong></p> <p><strong>Keith:</strong> Because it\u2019s real, and organic. We are ourselves. When we were putting it together, the image I had in mind was James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson. If you look at the dynamic between them, whatever they talk about is interesting because of how they interact. We can\u2019t say we speak for all men but we definitely speak for some.</p> <p><strong>Marvin:</strong> The trendy ones. It\u2019s a black voice as well \u2013 I feel, in the UK, the voice of the youth and of certain groups isn\u2019t heard on podcasts.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re friends in real life. How do you keep it fresh? Don\u2019t you get sick of each other?</strong></p> <p><strong>Tazer:</strong> We are sick of each other.</p> <p><strong>K:</strong> It\u2019s because we\u2019re around each other so much that we always have fresh content. Marv can tell a story and I can say, \u201cI was there, but that\u2019s not how it happened.\u201d</p> <p><strong>As a voice of youth, especially young black men, do you feel any pressure to represent?</strong></p> <p><strong>K:</strong> Nah, we just be ourselves. We want to show anyone who listens that you can be yourself.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> I feel like, if you think about it too much it\u2019ll mess you up.</p> <p><strong>T:</strong> We represent people from our area. A lot of our fans have grown up with us so they\u2019ve heard our struggles.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> It\u2019s why we can\u2019t lie. People know us too well; we\u2019d never get away with it.</p> <p><strong>You guys talk a lot about sex and relationships on your podcast</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> [<em>Looks at Marv</em>] Because he\u2019s very active.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> If I\u2019m active, we\u2019re all active.</p> <p><strong>K:</strong> Excuse me, I\u2019m a pillar of my community.</p> <p><strong>What do your families think of the podcast?</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> My mum listens.</p> <p><strong>K:</strong> My sister listens; my mum\u2019s not allowed.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> My mum and dad do not.</p> <p><strong>K:</strong> <em>[To Marvin]</em> They\u2019re not even aware you have a podcast, are they?</p> <p><strong>M: </strong>They are now, but they don\u2019t listen. My dad asked me where to find it. I told him to search for BBC Proms.</p> <p><strong>K:</strong> My dad asked me, \u201cHow do you listen?\u201d, too. I thought, \u201cWhat do you mean how do I listen? You don\u2019t!\u201d Mind your business, Dad.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Everything felt depressing.

The key to this shift is <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/reasonstobecheerful\">Reasons To Be Cheerful</a>, the podcast he co-hosts with broadcaster Geoff Lloyd where, far from the grip of political advisers, Miliband gets to be himself.</p> <p>Each week, Reasons focuses on ideas and social movements that might make the world a better place, from universal basic income to robust transgender rights. It includes appearances from academics and activists, while also providing ample time for the ramblings of Lloyd and Miliband, whose warmth, rapport and gentle ribbing of each other has helped to catapult the show to the top of the podcast charts. Alongside the regular podcast is a live show that travels around the country.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about your friendship</strong></p> <p><strong>Ed:</strong> It\u2019s what Geoff\u2019s wife calls our \u201clate-in-life friendship\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Geoff:</strong> It\u2019s the first great bromance of the 21st century.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> Other than Brangelina?</p> <p><strong>G:</strong> I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bromance, Ed. More straight romance. Anyway, I interviewed Ed on a radio show in the run-up to the 2015 general election. It was considered one of the best interviews Ed had done.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> I was nearly human in it.</p> <p><strong>G:</strong> Eighteen months later I was thinking of starting a podcast and thought, \u201cI know who will have some time on his hands.\u201d</p> <p>Everything felt a bit depressing \u2013 the country divided, the insanity of Trump. I thought, \u201cWhat about a podcast with some optimism?\u201d</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> Also, I wanted to find a way to promote the ideas I cared about and this seemed like a good way to reach people.</p> <p><strong>Why have you never covered Brexit?</strong></p> <p><strong>G:</strong> Because what\u2019s there to be positive about?</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> If you want to know about Brexit you can read the newspapers, listen to radio. I think what people feel viscerally is there are all these other things that aren\u2019t being addressed. We\u2019re trying to fill that gap.</p> <p><strong>In the podcast, there is a setup called the Geoffocracy, what is that?</strong></p> <p><strong>E:</strong> The Geoffocracy is where Geoff is the supreme, benign-ish ruler.</p> <p><strong>G:</strong> You keep saying benign-ish, but I would definitely be benign.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> So, we always ask our guests at the end of every interview what they would do in the Geoffocracy. It\u2019s a good mechanism to force them to ask what\u2019s actually going to solve the problem.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next for the show? Will you take it international?</strong></p> <p><strong>E:</strong> We\u2019ve actually got a little spin-off which will come out later this year \u2013 a book club. Increasingly, publishers come to us with interesting books which don\u2019t quite fit into our format, so we\u2019ll be making another podcast focused on books and authors. We also want to make all the research that goes into each show available for listeners who want to find out more. And on the international front, we did Reasons To Be Icelandic.</p> <p><strong>G:</strong> Ed and I went into the geothermal hot spa together which took our relationship to the next level. We made a video but Ed is suppressing it.</p> <p><strong>E:</strong> I refuse to release it.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018One guy told us to stop giving girls confidence!\u2019 <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/thereceiptspodcast\">The Receipts</a></strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"223bfde95c2d1305b5582d7d6a45549cc3964560\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/223bfde95c2d1305b5582d7d6a45549cc3964560/0_164_3678_4598/800.jpg\" alt=\"Audrey Akande, Tolani Shoneye and Milena Sanchez, hosts of The Receipts\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From left: Audrey Akande, Tolani Shoneye and Milena Sanchez, hosts of The Receipts, photographed at this year\u2019s British Podcast awards</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tolani Shoneye was working at Buzzfeed as a journalist when, inspired by the men\u2019s podcast 3 Shots Of Tequila, she asked on Twitter if any other young women would be interested in creating a similarly unadulterated chat about life and sex for women.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I listen to a lot of podcasts and felt there was no one who sounded like me. It was just white men\u2019s voices</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She whittled down the responses, eventually arranging a meet-up in a pub with Audrey Akande, then a PA at an advertising agency, and Milena Sanchez, a former retail worker. The chemistry between the three was instant. An hour-long meeting turned into a five-hour laugh-fest and the podcast was born. The name is taken from a Whitney Houston quote. Each week the trio discuss relationships, health, race and more, with refreshing frankness. They also include episodes dedicated to their listeners\u2019 problems. Their approach is carefree, raucous and sisterly.</p> <p><strong>How would you describe the podcast?</strong></p> <p><strong>Tolani:</strong> It\u2019s like a women\u2019s group chat, so things you would say to your friends. Filthy, but also inspirational.</p> <p><strong>What inspired you to get started?</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> I listen to a lot of podcasts and felt there was no one who sounded like me. It was just white men\u2019s voices, doing documentaries or reporting.</p> <p><strong>Audrey:</strong> My reasons were a bit more selfish. This was like therapy, to just get into a room and talk.</p> <p><strong>You started your podcast on your own. How did it feel sending that first episode out into the world?</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> I turned my phone off. I was so nervous.</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I was the opposite, I was looking at Twitter every second. And the reception was brilliant. We had 3,500 plays on the first day.</p> <p><strong>Milena:</strong> I don\u2019t think any of us understood what was going to happen.</p> <p><strong>T:</strong> That\u2019s the beauty of audio: it can be makeshift. Our first episodes are awful\u2026</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> Our first 10 episodes.</p> <p><strong>T:</strong> The sound quality is awful, I can\u2019t believe people listened to it. It was trial and error.</p> <p><strong>Have you given any bad advice to your listeners?</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> Loads.</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> We\u2019re quite good at saying we don\u2019t know the answer if we don\u2019t, because some things are above our pay grade.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> But we have the hashtag on Twitter, so if people do think we\u2019ve given bad advice, they can tell us.</p> <p><strong>T:</strong> And they tell us. I once made a comment about flushing tampons and all these people started sending me links about why I shouldn\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the feedback you get from male listeners?</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> One of the funniest bits of feedback we\u2019ve had was from a guy at a party. He came up to us and said, \u201cOi, you lot. Stop giving girls confidence.\u201d</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> We get that a lot from guys. They often say, \u201cStop spilling the secrets, stop telling women to leave us.\u201d I think our male listeners are more open about listening to us now. I respect them; you have to have balls to listen to us.</p> <p><strong>T:</strong> And they definitely come to our live shows to meet girls.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel like role models, and is that a lot of pressure?</strong></p> <p><strong>T:</strong> The role model thing is a bother to me. I am problematic. I\u2019m aware I am a flawed individual. I don\u2019t want people saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this because Tolani did it\u201d, because I really don\u2019t know anything.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> When people say they look up to me, I think, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, that\u2019s a bit scary.\u201d We\u2019re human so you can hear our journey from episode one \u2013 you can hear how our opinions have changed.</p> <p><strong>Listening to the three of you, there is obviously a lot of love, but you also make fun of each other</strong></p> <p><strong>A:</strong> We argue, we fight, we get on with it. If someone\u2019s got a problem we say so.</p> <p><strong>M:</strong> We don\u2019t hold grudges.</p> <p><strong>T:</strong> I wonder if it is a cultural thing, too. We\u2019re all second-generation immigrants, but within our cultures we talk about our issues. My mum won\u2019t say, \u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of tea.\u201d She\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat\u2019s good?

      "bodyText": "As Twitter became too angry and the news cycle too tense, it is no accident that I fell face first into the unfettered joy of podcasts \u2013 light, illuminating chat and people enthusing about their passions. I listen to them in the dark, just as I used to listen to DJ Tom Ferrie on BBC Radio Scotland in the 80s. There is something so soothing about a warm duvet, a blacked out room and a link between you and some strangers who are on your wavelength. Now my radio is the iPhone under my pillow. I find that podcasts are so personal, they are actually quite difficult to \u201csell\u201d to a friend. For example, I love Something Rhymes With Purple presented by Gyles Brandreth and Susie Dent. It\u2019s a podcast about semantics. No, come back. It\u2019s brilliant! Here are two people who love language and take enormous pleasure in discussing how \u201cscurryfunge\u201d means to rush about tidying before guests arrive, or how \u201cpandiculating\u201d is stretching and yawning at the same time. Brandreth, of course, is also a hive of royal anecdotes and eccentric off-topic chat. I have loved him since I was a little girl when he wrote practical joke books, teaching children how to make an apple-pie bed. Now, I can listen in as he and Dent discuss their student days and family lives. As a Radio 4 presenter, I often think double-act, chitchat podcasts like these capture the essence of how studios feel before recording starts. Before people begin to read scripts, self-edit or worry they are not keeping things broad enough. With podcasts the hosts can be as obscure or gorgeously self-indulgent as they desire. Only the most cynical podcasters tailor their content for mass-market numbers; the best ones have a \u201cThis is us: like it, or shove off\u201d attitude. Dear Joan And Jericha, with Vicki Pepperdine and Julia Davis, is so wilfully filthy and dark that I think twice before sharing it with friends. Here the world\u2019s worst, least sympathetic agony aunts take on bleak sexual problems, such as what to do if your partner only wants to kick your vagina with his athlete\u2019s foot-ridden toes while he reads the rugby results. It makes Davis\u2019s previous television output look like The Good Life. It is wholly strange, clever on a dozen levels and makes me gasp for air laughing. I\u2019ve been a guest on Fortunately... with Fi Glover and Jane Garvey, which was marvellous as I was a big fan, and I can confirm that this podcast really is just two friends chuntering waspishly about fellow BBC talent and their own lives. They don\u2019t set out to be cool, shocking or candid, and by default they are all three. My very favourite podcast has one host, but a changing roster of guests. On Looks Unfamiliar, Tim Worthington and friends ruminate over obscure things from the 70s and 80s that they remember, but, vitally, no one else seems to. (Not Spacehoppers or Um Bongo \u2013 more like Big Daddy\u2019s thwarted Saturday morning show, or the Boots Global Collection makeup range). I do not know a single other soul who listens to it, and I\u2019m happy that way. Podcasts can be far ruder, more irreverent, sillier or unfocused than any other medium. They can be uploaded to a global platform sounding like a bit of a dog\u2019s dinner, the presenter streaming with cold and the sound levels thoroughly wonky. As a listener, I care little. I know these teams are doing this mainly for love and for the happiness of being heard. And we get it for free \u2013 normal 21st-century rules and expectations do not apply here. It\u2019s exciting. We live in interesting times. If I ever get out of bed, I may possibly see them. Grace Dent \u2018There is probably a vagina in every episode\u2019 Dear Joan And Jericha Actors and writers Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine have been friends for more than 20 years, working together often. Mainstays of the British comedy scene, they are probably best known for the black comedy Nighty Night. Their podcast, Dear Joan And Jericha, in which the duo play local radio agony aunts who tackle listeners\u2019 sex, life and relationship issues in an entirely inappropriate manner, became a near instant word-of-mouth hit when it was launched a year ago, and went on to win best comedy at the 2019 British Podcast Awards. Series one (a snappy eight 20-minute episodes) calls to mind the absurd sex tips from women\u2019s magazines, mixed in with your mum\u2019s most insensitive and outrageous off-hand comments. In true Davis and Pepperdine form, it is filthy. It\u2019s not just the hilarious improvised asides that have won the podcast a multitude of fans, but the way it openly addresses messy sex, bodily functions and anatomy, as well as emphasising that it\u2019s not always men who are responsible for exacerbating women\u2019s insecurities. Why did you want to start a podcast? Vicki: Well, we didn\u2019t even think about a podcast in the beginning. We were just playing around with ideas. Julia: The characters emerged. We didn\u2019t want anyone to tell us what to do, which is what happens in TV. V: [To Julia] I think you suggested a podcast. And I didn\u2019t really know about podcasts. It\u2019s a generational thing, I guess. Then we did it and people said, \u201cYou need to advertise it.\u201d And we said, \u201cShall we just see if people find it?\u201d \u2013 and they did. What are your red lines \u2013 where wouldn\u2019t you go? J: It comes down to the tone of it. You can go almost anywhere. But you can listen back and go: \u201cThat\u2019s actually really sick and distressing.\u201d It\u2019s whether or not you are still finding it funny. V: I think there\u2019s something about talking very openly about what, for years, has been a sort of no-go, gynae area \u2013 young women in particular seem to be emboldened by it. Who are your podcast/radio heroes? V: I listen to My Dad Wrote A Porno. I think that\u2019s great. J: Derek and Clive. I\u2019m a massive Peter Cook fan. Obviously they\u2019re not podcasters. I think, similarly to Vicki, I didn\u2019t listen to a lot of podcasts. On a train I always just want to look at people and listen to their conversations. What has been your favourite episode to date? J: That\u2019s a really hard one. The godson one we quite liked. I certainly can\u2019t remember whole episodes. We like it when we get a bit carried away describing men. Going into the detail of their physicality. V: Inappropriate appraisals. We try to group the subjects, so there\u2019s not three vaginas in every episode. J: Although there probably is a vagina in every episode. Is there such a thing as an overshare? J: I would say no. V: I don\u2019t think we could ever overshare with one another. It\u2019s a bond of trust. J: I would say that, with any really close friend, you should be able to say anything. Whereas our parents\u2019 generation \u2013 I\u2019m sure my mum, who is no longer here, didn\u2019t have anything like that. And that must be quite horrible. Because you want someone to say, \u201cI get things.\u201d But we\u2019ve definitely recorded things that we think, \u201cThat\u2019s gone sick in a way we don\u2019t find funny.\u201d V: We don\u2019t censor ourselves when recording, and then sometimes it\u2019s come out in a way that might be misinterpreted. So we edit. When can we expect the new series to be out? V: We are towards the end of recording it, so we don\u2019t know exactly yet. But it will happen. That\u2019s as precise as we can be. We record it in Julia\u2019s kitchen. We thought it was going to be just for us, and it turns out people like it. \u2018We gained a reputation as a pair of wisecracking broads\u2019 Fortunately... Broadcasters Jane Garvey and Fi Glover are the co-hosts of Radio 4\u2019s hit podcast Fortunately... Each week they share musings on their lives, from pet deaths and garden hose repairs to the trouble with HRT patches, before being joined by a radio, TV or podcast star such as political journalist Laura Kuenssberg or actor and comedian London Hughes. It\u2019s like sitting in on a tipsy conversation in a BBC green room. Radio 4 listeners will be familiar with both hosts \u2013 Garvey presents Women\u2019s Hour and Glover The Listening Project \u2013 but the podcast is far more intimate than the station\u2019s usual output, earning it a devoted fanbase. What is the story of your friendship? Jane: I knew of Fi for a while before we met. We both worked at 5 Live but I avoided her. I didn\u2019t like her because I was quite jealous. I thought Fi was a bit of a metropolitan know-it-all. But I knew she was good. Fi: Well, I\u2019ve always loved and admired Jane. We worked in the same station but were at different ends of the day. Then we hosted the Radio Festival together in 2013. We just had such a laugh. J: There\u2019s a low bar set for women being funny, so I think the fact that we didn\u2019t need scripts and were moderately amusing was enough to gain us a reputation as a pair of wisecracking broads. Eventually, we recorded a pilot. What can you get away with on the podcast that you can\u2019t on the radio? F: Quite a lot actually. They\u2019d never let us take the piss out of each other if we were doing the Today programme together. J: Not much joshery on that show is there? F: That\u2019s the joy of podcasts. There\u2019s a very clearly defined structure to a radio show. Podcasting zigs and zags all over the place, and I think that suits the way lots of women talk to their friends. Did you expect the show to become so popular? J: Yes, we were expecting massive success. Absolutely massive. F: Come on, let\u2019s leave it Jane. J: OK, yes, sorry. To be perfectly honest, I\u2019m angry that I didn\u2019t spot the obvious gap in the market. We talk about serious things, but we also talk utter shit, as you do with your female friends down the pub. The fact that no one spotted that\u2019s what women wanted \u2013 because for years, women had to put up with just men talking at them \u2013 is almost a failure of radio. Who is your dream guest to have on the show? F: I\u2019d do Debbie Harry. J: Deborah, she prefers. I know because she was on Women\u2019s Hour. I couldn\u2019t speak, I was agog, one of the worst interviews of my life. F: Was she worth it? J: I don\u2019t know, because I couldn\u2019t think of a single thing to ask her. So yes, I could make amends for that terrible interview. Do you show different personalities in the podcasts? J: I\u2019m substantially more restrained on the Hour. On the podcast we give away more of our real selves. Like that I\u2019m a hopeless case, a nervous wreck, I\u2019m riddled with anxiety, irritable bowel syndrome, single. You have become these unlikely role models\u2026 J: Unlikely! Seems a bit harsh but OK, I really don\u2019t mind. [To Fi] She\u2019s younger than us, isn\u2019t she? F: I don\u2019t think either of us would say we\u2019re role models but we\u2019re working women who have managed to produce families in various shapes and sizes. There\u2019s nothing perfect about either of our lives \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s refreshing. \u2018I\u2019m not a representative of Islam. I\u2019m just me\u2019 No Country For Young Women Monty Onanuga and Sadia Azmat were friends well before they became the co-hosts of No Country For Young Women, a BBC Sounds podcast discussing life and love as British women of colour. It is now in its second series; each week they are joined by a special guest (model Munroe Bergdorf, comedian Nish Kumar and singer Grace Carter have all made appearances) covering topics such as polyamory, dating as a Muslim, self-care and body positivity. The joy of the show lies in the duo\u2019s rapport. If it sounds like listening to a conversation between old friends over a cup of tea, that\u2019s because it pretty much is \u2013 the young women used to work together in banking. Azmat went on to become a standup comedian, and was spotted by the BBC. They asked her to propose a co-host for a possible podcast, and she knew just the person to call. Why do you record in a cafe? Monty: For access to food. Sadia: So it\u2019s less formal and more impromptu. We don\u2019t want to sound presentery. M: We\u2019re not broadcasters by trade, so a studio would make us feel like it\u2019s work. But it doesn\u2019t feel like work when we catch up in a coffee house and have a chinwag. Monty, you regularly speak frankly about sex. Why do you feel so passionately about doing this? M: Among my friends I am the one who speaks most graphically about sex. It winds me up that it\u2019s OK for men to enjoy sex and share their experiences. But if a woman does so she\u2019s \u201ceasy\u201d. I don\u2019t subscribe to that narrative and I want to encourage young people to understand what turns us on. In fact, I want all people to do that \u2013 I am pretty sure I have some aunties who don\u2019t know where their clitoris is and some uncles who haven\u2019t found it. We\u2019re all discussing mental health at the minute; well, a good shag works wonders. You still work at an investment bank \u2013 have the two worlds collided? M: When we first started the podcast, I used to catch the train home with our chief operating officer, and of course we\u2019d talk. I told him about the show and he promoted it on the office newsletters, even though I\u2019d just spoken to Sadia about how I\u2019d given someone a blowjob. Sadia, you\u2019re a Muslim woman with a podcast that discusses sex. Has this made you the subject of criticism from the community? S: Not much. Although I did recently write an article (\u201cHorny Muslim women like me aren\u2019t supposed to exist during Ramadan\u201d) and got a couple of \u201cyou\u2019re going to burn in hell\u201d type of messages. All I said in the article is that trying to keep sex and sexuality hush-hush is not good. I do like challenging the image that Muslim women are all covered up, repressed and don\u2019t enjoy sex. I provide balance. But I\u2019m not a representative of Islam. I\u2019m just me. M: We\u2019ve grown up in cultures that tell you, \u201cDon\u2019t do this, don\u2019t do that,\u201d but we live in a country where we\u2019re a mishmash of cultures and you can find what\u2019s right for you. S: The pressure isn\u2019t fair. I\u2019m tired of being a brown person who is not allowed to fail, and has to be perfect to everyone all the time, when people are fluid, and who they are and what they need changes. I\u2019m interested in the idea that being mediocre as a woman of colour is a revolutionary act S: Yes! It reminds me of something Chris Rock said. On his street he lives with Jay-Z, one of the most successful rappers in the world, and Mary J Blige, one of the most successful singers in the world. And his white neighbour is a dentist. It would be great to not have to work twice as hard. M: We shouldn\u2019t settle for mediocre, though. S: I guess it\u2019s more about failure. As an Asian child I wasn\u2019t allowed to get Cs and Ds. I had to get As. M: Right. We should be allowed to discuss failure. On our podcast we do. S: And without doom and gloom. Neither of us is crying about the cards we\u2019ve been dealt. \u2018We don\u2019t speak for all men, but we definitely speak for some\u2019 3 Shots Of Tequila Marvin Abbey, Keith Dube and Tazer Black have known each other for so long, it\u2019s not quite clear exactly how they first met. But since 2016, they have co-hosted 3 Shots Of Tequila, an unfiltered, banter-packed weekly podcast where the conversation can go anywhere. A typical episode might flit between international politics and celebrity news, all the while discussing the presenters\u2019 own lives as young men navigating sex, family and friendships. They also act as agony uncles to their listeners, who send in dilemmas for the trio to solve, and the conversation continues online under the hashtag #3ShotsofTequila. They have created a dedicated community that over the last three years has helped them sell out Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire, tour international music festivals, and land themselves an exclusive streaming deal with Spotify. Why do you think the podcast is so popular? Keith: Because it\u2019s real, and organic. We are ourselves. When we were putting it together, the image I had in mind was James May, Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson. If you look at the dynamic between them, whatever they talk about is interesting because of how they interact. We can\u2019t say we speak for all men but we definitely speak for some. Marvin: The trendy ones. It\u2019s a black voice as well \u2013 I feel, in the UK, the voice of the youth and of certain groups isn\u2019t heard on podcasts. You\u2019re friends in real life. How do you keep it fresh? Don\u2019t you get sick of each other? Tazer: We are sick of each other. K: It\u2019s because we\u2019re around each other so much that we always have fresh content. Marv can tell a story and I can say, \u201cI was there, but that\u2019s not how it happened.\u201d As a voice of youth, especially young black men, do you feel any pressure to represent? K: Nah, we just be ourselves. We want to show anyone who listens that you can be yourself. M: I feel like, if you think about it too much it\u2019ll mess you up. T: We represent people from our area. A lot of our fans have grown up with us so they\u2019ve heard our struggles. M: It\u2019s why we can\u2019t lie. People know us too well; we\u2019d never get away with it. You guys talk a lot about sex and relationships on your podcast T: [Looks at Marv] Because he\u2019s very active. M: If I\u2019m active, we\u2019re all active. K: Excuse me, I\u2019m a pillar of my community. What do your families think of the podcast? T: My mum listens. K: My sister listens; my mum\u2019s not allowed. M: My mum and dad do not. K: [To Marvin] They\u2019re not even aware you have a podcast, are they? M: They are now, but they don\u2019t listen. My dad asked me where to find it. I told him to search for BBC Proms. K: My dad asked me, \u201cHow do you listen?\u201d, too. I thought, \u201cWhat do you mean how do I listen? You don\u2019t!\u201d Mind your business, Dad. \u2018Everything felt depressing. I thought, what about some optimism?\u2019 Reasons To Be Cheerful Since Ed Miliband resigned as leader of the Labour party in 2015, he has been steadily transforming his reputation from unrelatable gaffe-magnet, to an insightful, warm and genuinely funny media personality. The key to this shift is Reasons To Be Cheerful, the podcast he co-hosts with broadcaster Geoff Lloyd where, far from the grip of political advisers, Miliband gets to be himself. Each week, Reasons focuses on ideas and social movements that might make the world a better place, from universal basic income to robust transgender rights. It includes appearances from academics and activists, while also providing ample time for the ramblings of Lloyd and Miliband, whose warmth, rapport and gentle ribbing of each other has helped to catapult the show to the top of the podcast charts. Alongside the regular podcast is a live show that travels around the country. Tell me about your friendship Ed: It\u2019s what Geoff\u2019s wife calls our \u201clate-in-life friendship\u201d. Geoff: It\u2019s the first great bromance of the 21st century. E: Other than Brangelina? G: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bromance, Ed. More straight romance. Anyway, I interviewed Ed on a radio show in the run-up to the 2015 general election. It was considered one of the best interviews Ed had done. E: I was nearly human in it. G: Eighteen months later I was thinking of starting a podcast and thought, \u201cI know who will have some time on his hands.\u201d Everything felt a bit depressing \u2013 the country divided, the insanity of Trump. I thought, \u201cWhat about a podcast with some optimism?\u201d E: Also, I wanted to find a way to promote the ideas I cared about and this seemed like a good way to reach people. Why have you never covered Brexit? G: Because what\u2019s there to be positive about? E: If you want to know about Brexit you can read the newspapers, listen to radio. I think what people feel viscerally is there are all these other things that aren\u2019t being addressed. We\u2019re trying to fill that gap. In the podcast, there is a setup called the Geoffocracy, what is that? E: The Geoffocracy is where Geoff is the supreme, benign-ish ruler. G: You keep saying benign-ish, but I would definitely be benign. E: So, we always ask our guests at the end of every interview what they would do in the Geoffocracy. It\u2019s a good mechanism to force them to ask what\u2019s actually going to solve the problem. What\u2019s next for the show? Will you take it international? E: We\u2019ve actually got a little spin-off which will come out later this year \u2013 a book club. Increasingly, publishers come to us with interesting books which don\u2019t quite fit into our format, so we\u2019ll be making another podcast focused on books and authors. We also want to make all the research that goes into each show available for listeners who want to find out more. And on the international front, we did Reasons To Be Icelandic. G: Ed and I went into the geothermal hot spa together which took our relationship to the next level. We made a video but Ed is suppressing it. E: I refuse to release it. \u2018One guy told us to stop giving girls confidence!\u2019 The Receipts Tolani Shoneye was working at Buzzfeed as a journalist when, inspired by the men\u2019s podcast 3 Shots Of Tequila, she asked on Twitter if any other young women would be interested in creating a similarly unadulterated chat about life and sex for women. She whittled down the responses, eventually arranging a meet-up in a pub with Audrey Akande, then a PA at an advertising agency, and Milena Sanchez, a former retail worker. The chemistry between the three was instant. An hour-long meeting turned into a five-hour laugh-fest and the podcast was born. The name is taken from a Whitney Houston quote. Each week the trio discuss relationships, health, race and more, with refreshing frankness. They also include episodes dedicated to their listeners\u2019 problems. Their approach is carefree, raucous and sisterly. How would you describe the podcast? Tolani: It\u2019s like a women\u2019s group chat, so things you would say to your friends. Filthy, but also inspirational. What inspired you to get started? T: I listen to a lot of podcasts and felt there was no one who sounded like me. It was just white men\u2019s voices, doing documentaries or reporting. Audrey: My reasons were a bit more selfish. This was like therapy, to just get into a room and talk. You started your podcast on your own. How did it feel sending that first episode out into the world? T: I turned my phone off. I was so nervous. A: I was the opposite, I was looking at Twitter every second. And the reception was brilliant. We had 3,500 plays on the first day. Milena: I don\u2019t think any of us understood what was going to happen. T: That\u2019s the beauty of audio: it can be makeshift. Our first episodes are awful\u2026 M: Our first 10 episodes. T: The sound quality is awful, I can\u2019t believe people listened to it. It was trial and error. Have you given any bad advice to your listeners? T: Loads. A: We\u2019re quite good at saying we don\u2019t know the answer if we don\u2019t, because some things are above our pay grade. M: But we have the hashtag on Twitter, so if people do think we\u2019ve given bad advice, they can tell us. T: And they tell us. I once made a comment about flushing tampons and all these people started sending me links about why I shouldn\u2019t. What\u2019s the feedback you get from male listeners? T: One of the funniest bits of feedback we\u2019ve had was from a guy at a party. He came up to us and said, \u201cOi, you lot. Stop giving girls confidence.\u201d A: We get that a lot from guys. They often say, \u201cStop spilling the secrets, stop telling women to leave us.\u201d I think our male listeners are more open about listening to us now. I respect them; you have to have balls to listen to us. T: And they definitely come to our live shows to meet girls. Do you feel like role models, and is that a lot of pressure? T: The role model thing is a bother to me. I am problematic. I\u2019m aware I am a flawed individual. I don\u2019t want people saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to do this because Tolani did it\u201d, because I really don\u2019t know anything. M: When people say they look up to me, I think, \u201cPlease don\u2019t, that\u2019s a bit scary.\u201d We\u2019re human so you can hear our journey from episode one \u2013 you can hear how our opinions have changed. Listening to the three of you, there is obviously a lot of love, but you also make fun of each other A: We argue, we fight, we get on with it. If someone\u2019s got a problem we say so. M: We don\u2019t hold grudges. T: I wonder if it is a cultural thing, too. We\u2019re all second-generation immigrants, but within our cultures we talk about our issues. My mum won\u2019t say, \u201cLet\u2019s have a cup of tea.\u201d She\u2019ll say, \u201cWhat\u2019s good? Let\u2019s fight.\u201d \u2022 Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine interviewed by Hannah Jane Parkinson If you would like a comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "It is just over three years since the \u201cGrand Bargain\u201d was struck. It was signed by the world\u2019s major donors and aid providers, promising structural reform and committed to getting more money directly through to local and national organisations. But the deal has seen little change. The system remains dominated by a familiar group of UN agencies and international NGOs. Progress is at a glacial pace. A lot of criticism for the lack of change is aimed at the UN system \u2013 much of it justified. But NGOs need to look at themselves too. Many carry out life-saving work often in some of the world\u2019s most challenging places. This spectrum of aid organisations has sometimes been called an ecosystem , drawing resilience from its diversity. However, the world is evolving \u2013 not always in good ways \u2013 and so must our response. Increasingly, poverty is concentrated in pockets of protracted crises and fragility \u2013 conflict causes 80% of humanitarian needs. The Democratic Republic of the Congo has more than 13 million people in need of aid. Syria has a similar number. Yemen, Iraq, South Sudan and Somalia are among the most unsafe places to be a human being \u2013 particularly if you are a woman or a child. More than two billion people live in the most insecure and fragile parts of the world. If we are to truly Leave No One Behind in delivering the sustainable development goals, these are the places we need to reach. To do this we must reform the aid ecosystem, which is out of balance. Humanitarian and development assistance is siloed, inefficient and expensive, falling short of achieving lasting impact at scale. There are often too many small to medium-sized NGOs that are too similar, competing with local and national organisations across too many geographies, rather than offering something different. It has long been recognised that local agencies, embedded in communities and with lower overhead costs, are best placed to deliver aid and programmes where they can.

People think about the fashion industry and think you can only be a fashion designer but think about the hundreds of different jobs involved in fashion. From design to manufacturing to content to production, it\u2019s a huge business and it\u2019s always very important to try and encourage young people. A lot of these teenagers don\u2019t leave their borough and its difficult to draw a line between their situations and people in the fashion industry.

Fast fashion is terrible, not only for the environment, but for the halo effect it has on the whole of the industry in total. If you look at a lot of the luxury brands, they are making goods to last. Think of a Herm\u00e8s handbag, you\u2019re not buying a new one every six months. That\u2019s investment buying, which is what menswear has always been about.\u201d Presenting their collections this weekend are several designers celebrated for adopting an ethical and considered approach, including Ahluwalia Studio, Samuel Ross and Bethany Williams, who was awarded the Queen Elizabeth award in February for her endeavours. Also joining proceedings will be sustainable designers Christopher Raeburn and Duran Lantinck, who will take part in an upcycling masterclass with producer, actor and activist Lena Waithe. While LFWM is held in London, the BFC is currently actively incubating talent from around the UK. Three years ago, it launched its Saturday Clubs in collaboration with the Sorrell Foundation. It\u2019s an initiative that aims to give young people aged 14 to 16 the chance to study at a local institution for free. The aim, says Jones, is to give future talent the support and advice needed to be pursue successful careers. \u201cIt\u2019s a version of apprenticeship,\u201d says Jones. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s missing is a vertical line of people getting into our industry. People think about the fashion industry and think you can only be a fashion designer but think about the hundreds of different jobs involved in fashion. From design to manufacturing to content to production, it\u2019s a huge business and it\u2019s always very important to try and encourage young people. A lot of these teenagers don\u2019t leave their borough and its difficult to draw a line between their situations and people in the fashion industry. It\u2019s incumbent on us to do the outreach \u2013 we need to go into these communities to try and help.\u201d",

If Hull has its swagger back, there\u2019s good reason.</p> <p>The numbers that surrounded Hull\u2019s City of Culture were impressive: \u00a3219m of investment, 800 jobs created and 95% of residents who said they participated in at least one event. The bid\u2019s volunteer scheme attracted thousands who continue to give their time at art events around the city.</p> <p>And data released to the Guardian by the University of Hull\u2019s Culture, Place and Policy Institute suggests there has been a lasting effect: in 2018 and early 2019 there has been an 11% increase in attendance at culture events in the city and surrounding area. Tourism has seen a lift, a 15% increase in trips to the city compared 2016 figures.</p> <p>Katy Fuller is the outgoing chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.absolutelycultured.co.uk/\">Absolutely Cultured</a>, the charity that grew out of the company which ran City of Culture and is now charged with securing its legacy.

Fuller admits that funding the arts after the legacy money from the City of Culture has run out will be difficult (Absolutely Cultured had an ambitious fundraising target of \u00a311m, which has now been revised) but thinks 2017 helped local artists and groups learn how to access arts money.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s certainly hard, but one of the things that has changed now is there\u2019s been a huge leap in applications for Arts Council funding from individual artists and smaller theatre groups,\u201d she says. \u201cThey have the confidence now to go for that money.\u201d</p> <p>Art Council bids have grown.

At the start of a spring conference where the Green faithful will celebrate successful local and European elections, as well as national polling putting the party\u2019s support at up to 9%, Jonathan Bartley and Si\u00e2n Berry said it would be up to Labour or the Liberal Democrats to pursue the Greens. Berry, who became co-leader with Bartley last September, taking over from Caroline Lucas, said: \u201cThere\u2019s a very good case in many constituencies for us to be seen as being in the strongest position to beat the Brexit party. \u201cThe other parties would have to come to us, and we wouldn\u2019t be giving anything away in talks.

He said of any future deal: \u201cOn any issue where there\u2019s common ground, we\u2019re always willing to have a conversation. But at the same time, it\u2019s going to have to be a very robust conversation.

In the local elections in May, the Greens were the biggest proportional gainers of the national parties, winning 194 new councillors. Later that month, the party beat the Conservatives in the European elections, taking almost 12% of the vote. The co-leaders said the surge was also the result of many years of patient organising at a local level, building up what Bartley called a \u201cnetwork of field organisers\u201d. Berry said: \u201cWhen the local election results came in, every time it was, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve been there, Jonathan\u2019s been there, I recognise those people, I know why they won.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t a protest vote, a flash in the pan, a single issue.

Other initiatives will be new ways to measure the strength of the economy and transport policies based around the \u00a350bn-plus saved by scrapping HS2. Bartley said: \u201cWe think it\u2019s time to pull the plug on the project and put that money into the rail revolution that we need \u2013 cross-country and city links, getting more freight on to rail, electrifying lines, plus new bus routes for rural communities. \u201cAnd to find an alternative to short-haul flights, to get people out of their cars.

      "body": "<p>Michigan is a state in which Democrats <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/11/how-democrats-won-big-michigan-midterms/576043/\">drubbed</a> Republicans in the 2018 midterms, a Democrat governor has promised to veto anti-abortion legislation, and polling shows the population is solidly supportive of reproductive rights.</p> <p>Still, it could soon effectively ban abortion.</p> <p>Conservative activists here with Right To Life and the Michigan Heartbeat Coalition are planning to team up with Republican lawmakers to exploit a constitutional loophole that allows groups to use citizen ballot initiatives to dodge a governor\u2019s veto and implement anti-abortion laws without putting them to voters.</p> <p>Michigan law permits activist groups to participate in legislating or amending the state\u2019s constitution via ballot drives that let citizens vote on proposed laws. However, there is a loophole that allows the state legislature to make such citizen-initiated proposals straight into law before they are actually put to voters. If a proposal gets enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, the state legislature can simply approve it \u2013 foregoing a public vote and also making the law immune to a veto from the governor.</p> <p>Legal experts say the loophole exists to avoid the cost and resources required to put such proposals to a popular vote. But rightwing special interest groups are increasingly using it to push through unpopular laws without the support of the majority of the electorate or the governor.</p> <p>Now anti-abortion groups the Heartbeat Coalition and Right To Life are respectively planning initiatives that would ban abortions after six weeks and outlaw dilation and evacuation, which is the most common procedure for second trimester abortions. If they collect enough signatures, they will probably succeed in pushing through the laws, even though the overwhelming majority of Michigan voters and the governor will have no say in the matter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/29/louisiana-abortion-ban-passes-house\">Louisiana becomes latest US state to pass six-week abortion ban</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The anti-abortion groups are able to attempt their plan because Republicans control the state\u2019s legislature as Michigan\u2019s legislative districts are <a href=\"https://www.bridgemi.com/public-sector/gerrymandering-michigan-among-nations-worst-new-test-claims\">among the nation\u2019s most gerrymandered</a>. Though Michigan Democrats <a href=\"https://www.metrotimes.com/news-hits/archives/2018/11/07/once-again-michigan-dems-get-more-state-senate-and-house-votes-but-gop-keeps-power\">won far more votes</a> than Republicans in 2018, Republicans still hold solid majorities in the state house and senate.</p> <p>The anti-abortion groups thus each need to collect about 340,000 signatures \u2013 or about 4% of the electorate \u2013 to get the laws enacted by the Republican-controlled legislature. Opponents say the whole process is \u201cundemocratic\u201d and amounts to \u201cminority rule\u201d.</p> <p>The moves come as anti-abortion activists and Republicans seek to take advantage of the supreme court\u2019s new conservative majority to challenge the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision that guaranteed abortion rights for women nationwide. If they pass, Michigan could join nine other states that have this year passed laws severely restricting or effectively banning abortions.</p> <p>But Michigan\u2019s unique loophole means that would happen even though Pew <a href=\"https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/\">found</a> in 2014 that 54% of residents think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A June <a href=\"https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/06/06/poll-abortion-restriction-opposed-michigan-voters/1334853001/\">poll</a> also found that 58% of voters oppose banning the dilation and evacuation procedure that Right To Life is targeting.</p> <p>\u201cPublic opinion overwhelmingly shows that these [proposals] are not popular positions,\u201d said Merissa Kovachs, policy strategist with the ACLU of Michigan. \u201cPublic opinion overwhelmingly shows that people want to preserve Roe v Wade, and that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.\u201d</p> <p>Local Democrats are outraged.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a growing consensus that the system we have is broken. A lot of people don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re appropriately represented,\u201d the state senator Mallory McMorrow said. \u201cI think we have to keep in mind that the governor won by 10 percentage points, and this could get through with 4% of the population dictating laws counter to what the majority of residents are asking for.\u201d</p> <p>Heartbeat Coalition spokesman Mark Gurley seemed to confirm that objective in a recent <a href=\"https://www.michiganradio.org/post/group-backs-initiative-abortion-ban-after-first-heartbeat\">interview</a> with Michigan Public Radio. He said the group planned to \u201cskip that part\u201d, in reference to putting the proposal before voters. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make this a circus and a parade,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Right To Life is not new to this type of work. It\u2019s well-funded and organized, uses its alliances with the state\u2019s Catholic churches to efficiently collect signatures, and four times in recent decades has pushed through restrictive anti-abortion measures that Democrat and Republican governors vetoed.</p> <p>That includes banning public funds from being used to pay for abortions for welfare recipients in 1987. In 1990 it pushed through an initiative requiring parental consent before a minor can get an abortion, while in 2004 and 2013, respectively, it pushed through initiatives defining a legal birth and requiring women to purchase a health insurance rider if they want to have coverage for an abortion.</p> <p>The latter, dubbed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/13/michigans-abortion-rider-_n_4958517.html\">rape insurance</a>\u201d, polled between 36% and 41%, but Right To Life and the GOP successfully made it law with signatures from just 4% of voters.

      "bodyText": "Michigan is a state in which Democrats drubbed Republicans in the 2018 midterms, a Democrat governor has promised to veto anti-abortion legislation, and polling shows the population is solidly supportive of reproductive rights. Still, it could soon effectively ban abortion. Conservative activists here with Right To Life and the Michigan Heartbeat Coalition are planning to team up with Republican lawmakers to exploit a constitutional loophole that allows groups to use citizen ballot initiatives to dodge a governor\u2019s veto and implement anti-abortion laws without putting them to voters. Michigan law permits activist groups to participate in legislating or amending the state\u2019s constitution via ballot drives that let citizens vote on proposed laws. However, there is a loophole that allows the state legislature to make such citizen-initiated proposals straight into law before they are actually put to voters. If a proposal gets enough signatures to qualify for the ballot, the state legislature can simply approve it \u2013 foregoing a public vote and also making the law immune to a veto from the governor. Legal experts say the loophole exists to avoid the cost and resources required to put such proposals to a popular vote. But rightwing special interest groups are increasingly using it to push through unpopular laws without the support of the majority of the electorate or the governor. Now anti-abortion groups the Heartbeat Coalition and Right To Life are respectively planning initiatives that would ban abortions after six weeks and outlaw dilation and evacuation, which is the most common procedure for second trimester abortions. If they collect enough signatures, they will probably succeed in pushing through the laws, even though the overwhelming majority of Michigan voters and the governor will have no say in the matter. The anti-abortion groups are able to attempt their plan because Republicans control the state\u2019s legislature as Michigan\u2019s legislative districts are among the nation\u2019s most gerrymandered. Though Michigan Democrats won far more votes than Republicans in 2018, Republicans still hold solid majorities in the state house and senate. The anti-abortion groups thus each need to collect about 340,000 signatures \u2013 or about 4% of the electorate \u2013 to get the laws enacted by the Republican-controlled legislature. Opponents say the whole process is \u201cundemocratic\u201d and amounts to \u201cminority rule\u201d. The moves come as anti-abortion activists and Republicans seek to take advantage of the supreme court\u2019s new conservative majority to challenge the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision that guaranteed abortion rights for women nationwide. If they pass, Michigan could join nine other states that have this year passed laws severely restricting or effectively banning abortions. But Michigan\u2019s unique loophole means that would happen even though Pew found in 2014 that 54% of residents think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. A June poll also found that 58% of voters oppose banning the dilation and evacuation procedure that Right To Life is targeting. \u201cPublic opinion overwhelmingly shows that these [proposals] are not popular positions,\u201d said Merissa Kovachs, policy strategist with the ACLU of Michigan. \u201cPublic opinion overwhelmingly shows that people want to preserve Roe v Wade, and that women have a constitutional right to an abortion.\u201d Local Democrats are outraged. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing consensus that the system we have is broken. A lot of people don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re appropriately represented,\u201d the state senator Mallory McMorrow said. \u201cI think we have to keep in mind that the governor won by 10 percentage points, and this could get through with 4% of the population dictating laws counter to what the majority of residents are asking for.\u201d Heartbeat Coalition spokesman Mark Gurley seemed to confirm that objective in a recent interview with Michigan Public Radio. He said the group planned to \u201cskip that part\u201d, in reference to putting the proposal before voters. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make this a circus and a parade,\u201d he added. Right To Life is not new to this type of work. It\u2019s well-funded and organized, uses its alliances with the state\u2019s Catholic churches to efficiently collect signatures, and four times in recent decades has pushed through restrictive anti-abortion measures that Democrat and Republican governors vetoed. That includes banning public funds from being used to pay for abortions for welfare recipients in 1987. In 1990 it pushed through an initiative requiring parental consent before a minor can get an abortion, while in 2004 and 2013, respectively, it pushed through initiatives defining a legal birth and requiring women to purchase a health insurance rider if they want to have coverage for an abortion. The latter, dubbed \u201crape insurance\u201d, polled between 36% and 41%, but Right To Life and the GOP successfully made it law with signatures from just 4% of voters. It remains law today. \u201cThey have no intention of putting these proposals before voters,\u201d said Angela Vasquez-Giroux, director of communications for Planned Parenthood Advocacy of Michigan. \u201cIt\u2019s really an abuse of the democratic process.\u201d Right To Life sees its work differently. Genevieve Marnon, the group\u2019s legislative director, bristled at the suggestion that Right To Life\u2019s actions were \u201cundemocratic\u201d. \u201cYou better go to back to our founders on that one,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ca majority of voters\u201d put a pro-life legislature in place in the state, though Republicans in the Michigan senate and house did not get a majority of the popular vote. With the proposals likely to pass, the ACLU\u2019s Kovachs says litigation is on the table. \u201cThe six-week ban is just patently unconstitutional, women have a right to abortion before viability, and it\u2019s so extreme that it just flies in the face of Roe v Wade,\u201d she said, adding that the ACLU successfully blocked multiple other GOP attempts to ban dilation and evacuation bans. Perhaps the best option is for reproductive rights activists is to wield the citizen ballot initiative for its intended purpose \u2013 to put the matter in front of voters. State senator Jeff Irwin said a countermeasure is possible, and he supports the idea of \u201cputting something on the ballot that sorts out this issue once and for all.\u201d And though Right To Life may have previously passed restrictive legislation with little consequence, 2019 politics are a very different game. \u201cPeople are paying attention to this,\u201d McMorrow said. \u201cI think people have their finger on the pulse of what\u2019s happening and if they\u2019re trying to sneak things through, then they have to be aware that there\u2019s going to be a political backlash,\u201d she said, noting the 2018 state election in which Democrat women swept statewide office and made legislature gains despite severely gerrymandered districts. \u201cThis will galvanize women,\u201d she said.",

After all, that\u2019s how they got their start; their rambling conversations eventually \u201ccongealed\u201d (Talbot\u2019s word, enunciated with a theatrical relish) into an outline of something that could be a story. Over the next couple of years of grassroots development, the proof-of-concept trailer they put together as a calling card drew the attention of creative types sharing in his crusade. Talbot takes issue with this characterization of his narrative, though: \u201cPeople were inspired by Jimmie.\u201d</p> \n<p>A short film titled American Paradise got them into Sundance\u2019s good graces in 2017, and a Kickstarter fundraiser brought them the money required to complete their first feature-length effort. Two years later, Sundance welcomed them back as returning heroes, sending Talbot off with US dramatic directing award. San Francisco raised them and took care of them when their careers were still in the fledgling stages, and they used their resources to return the favor.</p> \n<p>Talbot and Fails attracted the best and brightest of San Francisco\u2019s thriving arts scene and put them to work on both sides of the camera. They packed the cast with actors with an innate feel for what makes the neighborhood unlike any other, scoring their first big name with born-and-raised Bay Area guy Danny Glover. Other behind-the-scenes personnel contributed perspective and expertise; ride-or-die producer Khaliah Neal knew the terrain like the back of her hand, while Berkeley-bred consultant Emma Nicholls brought a facility for performance art that shaped Jimmie and Montgomery\u2019s act of artistic rebellion in the film\u2019s final stretch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"fab09f5d-c8ad-45d1-bb3c-a9ee4b2795aa\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2JLYBGyqBn8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt was important to us that a lot of the cast be from San Francisco,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cPeople like the Greek chorus, they\u2019ve been in the city forever. It\u2019s about authenticity, sure, but it\u2019s also about showing how fuckin\u2019 talented the city is. People have been doing incredible work for decades, and we wanted to show off some of the ones we grew up with.\u201d</p> \n<p>That spirit of pride comes through in every aspect of Talbot and Fails\u2019 style, their method packed with touches of specificity to convey maximum adoration. Jimmie and Montgomery get around by doubling up on a single skateboard, a nod to the city\u2019s history as a cradle for black skating culture in America. \u201cBack in the \u201990s,\u201d Fails recalls, \u201cSan Francisco was a mecca for skateboarders. The hills attract a lot of people \u2014 black, Asian, Latino. That\u2019s where the melting-pot thing feels strongest.\u201d</p> \n<p>At every possible opportunity, they made the choice that would enhance their film\u2019s street cred, and that included the soundtrack. A more somber cover of \u201860s pop standard <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7I0vkKy504U\">\u201cSan Francisco\u201d</a> from R&amp;B crooner Michael Marshall scores one pivotal scene and gave the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0FnJDhY9-0\">trailer</a> a stirring musical component, but it represented something more significant to Talbot and Fails. \u201cIt was great to have it adapted by Mike, his soulful voice was perfect,\u201d Fails says. \u201cHe made it sound like gospel. I\u2019d never really heard the song until I heard his version. It never hit me that way, and that\u2019s been a common reaction.\u201d</p> \n<p>Talbot adds: \u201cIt was really written for Monterey Pop, for locals nervous about the kids that would descend on Monterey, both reassuring them that the kids would come peacefully \u2013 \u2018wear flowers in your hair\u2019 \u2013 and urging the kids to do just that. Kind of bizarre. Over time, a new warming nostalgia has formed around what\u2019s really a pretty song. But today\u2019s San Francisco isn\u2019t the same city it was in the \u201960s, and we wanted the song to reflect that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6e6d32df9f2aadbe6fdd6a50edf91897c540b3aa\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e6d32df9f2aadbe6fdd6a50edf91897c540b3aa/0_0_3600_2485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Talbot and Jimmie Fails at the Last Black Man in San Francisco premiere.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"690\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Talbot and Jimmie Fails at the Last Black Man in San Francisco premiere.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: imageSPACE for/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps most crucially, Talbot and Fails extended their guiding principles of empathy and respectful engagement past their relationship to the city, and applied them to their relationship to one another. They both recognized the fraught optics of a white man assuming the position of steward to a black man\u2019s life story, but felt that the racial dimension had little bearing on their process. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to say you don\u2019t see color,\u201d Fails says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like, this is my best friend. We\u2019re not just collaborators, like, he\u2019s telling my story and I\u2019m OK with that. This is my best friend.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a worthy discussion,\u201d Talbot clarifies. \u201cThere really are a lot of stories in San Francisco that I\u2019m not the right person to tell. But because Jimmie and I have worked together for so long and been close for even longer, it just felt natural to do it this way.\u201d</p> \n<p>They don\u2019t labor under any delusions that the movie they\u2019ve made can be a substitute for activism, but hope that it might be a catalyst for the same. They agree that only through purposeful unity can collective action be made possible, and strive to foster that ideal through their film\u2019s big, open heart. Their fondness for the city only gets stronger as tech moguls continue to carve it up. Talbot and Fails posit love as resistance, cinema as call to action, and themselves as servants to a higher cause.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe feel critical of the city, and take issue with what\u2019s happening there,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that the battle\u2019s lost. I think there\u2019s still hope for San Francisco.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about coming together, the real San Franciscans who are still there,\u201d says Fails. \u201cCreating one voice to represent everyone. You can fight back with art, that worked for them in the \u201960s. But only because they banded together and had that community feeling. That\u2019s the way to do it.\u201d</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The Last Black Man in San Francisco is now out in the US and will be released in the UK later this year</p></li> \n</ul>",

Over the next couple of years of grassroots development, the proof-of-concept trailer they put together as a calling card drew the attention of creative types sharing in his crusade. Talbot takes issue with this characterization of his narrative, though: \u201cPeople were inspired by Jimmie.\u201d A short film titled American Paradise got them into Sundance\u2019s good graces in 2017, and a Kickstarter fundraiser brought them the money required to complete their first feature-length effort. Two years later, Sundance welcomed them back as returning heroes, sending Talbot off with US dramatic directing award. San Francisco raised them and took care of them when their careers were still in the fledgling stages, and they used their resources to return the favor. Talbot and Fails attracted the best and brightest of San Francisco\u2019s thriving arts scene and put them to work on both sides of the camera. They packed the cast with actors with an innate feel for what makes the neighborhood unlike any other, scoring their first big name with born-and-raised Bay Area guy Danny Glover. Other behind-the-scenes personnel contributed perspective and expertise; ride-or-die producer Khaliah Neal knew the terrain like the back of her hand, while Berkeley-bred consultant Emma Nicholls brought a facility for performance art that shaped Jimmie and Montgomery\u2019s act of artistic rebellion in the film\u2019s final stretch. \u201cIt was important to us that a lot of the cast be from San Francisco,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cPeople like the Greek chorus, they\u2019ve been in the city forever. It\u2019s about authenticity, sure, but it\u2019s also about showing how fuckin\u2019 talented the city is. People have been doing incredible work for decades, and we wanted to show off some of the ones we grew up with.\u201d That spirit of pride comes through in every aspect of Talbot and Fails\u2019 style, their method packed with touches of specificity to convey maximum adoration. Jimmie and Montgomery get around by doubling up on a single skateboard, a nod to the city\u2019s history as a cradle for black skating culture in America. \u201cBack in the \u201990s,\u201d Fails recalls, \u201cSan Francisco was a mecca for skateboarders. The hills attract a lot of people \u2014 black, Asian, Latino. That\u2019s where the melting-pot thing feels strongest.\u201d At every possible opportunity, they made the choice that would enhance their film\u2019s street cred, and that included the soundtrack. A more somber cover of \u201860s pop standard \u201cSan Francisco\u201d from R&amp;B crooner Michael Marshall scores one pivotal scene and gave the trailer a stirring musical component, but it represented something more significant to Talbot and Fails. \u201cIt was great to have it adapted by Mike, his soulful voice was perfect,\u201d Fails says. \u201cHe made it sound like gospel. I\u2019d never really heard the song until I heard his version. It never hit me that way, and that\u2019s been a common reaction.\u201d Talbot adds: \u201cIt was really written for Monterey Pop, for locals nervous about the kids that would descend on Monterey, both reassuring them that the kids would come peacefully \u2013 \u2018wear flowers in your hair\u2019 \u2013 and urging the kids to do just that. Kind of bizarre. Over time, a new warming nostalgia has formed around what\u2019s really a pretty song. But today\u2019s San Francisco isn\u2019t the same city it was in the \u201960s, and we wanted the song to reflect that.\u201d Perhaps most crucially, Talbot and Fails extended their guiding principles of empathy and respectful engagement past their relationship to the city, and applied them to their relationship to one another. They both recognized the fraught optics of a white man assuming the position of steward to a black man\u2019s life story, but felt that the racial dimension had little bearing on their process. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to say you don\u2019t see color,\u201d Fails says. \u201cBut it\u2019s like, this is my best friend. We\u2019re not just collaborators, like, he\u2019s telling my story and I\u2019m OK with that. This is my best friend.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a worthy discussion,\u201d Talbot clarifies. \u201cThere really are a lot of stories in San Francisco that I\u2019m not the right person to tell. But because Jimmie and I have worked together for so long and been close for even longer, it just felt natural to do it this way.\u201d They don\u2019t labor under any delusions that the movie they\u2019ve made can be a substitute for activism, but hope that it might be a catalyst for the same. They agree that only through purposeful unity can collective action be made possible, and strive to foster that ideal through their film\u2019s big, open heart. Their fondness for the city only gets stronger as tech moguls continue to carve it up. Talbot and Fails posit love as resistance, cinema as call to action, and themselves as servants to a higher cause. \u201cWe feel critical of the city, and take issue with what\u2019s happening there,\u201d Talbot says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that the battle\u2019s lost. I think there\u2019s still hope for San Francisco.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s about coming together, the real San Franciscans who are still there,\u201d says Fails. \u201cCreating one voice to represent everyone. You can fight back with art, that worked for them in the \u201960s. But only because they banded together and had that community feeling. That\u2019s the way to do it.\u201d The Last Black Man in San Francisco is now out in the US and will be released in the UK later this year",

      "bodyText": "Federal Labor has demanded that home affairs minister Peter Dutton explain whether he or his office were involved in leaking national security advice during a political storm over Nauru and Manus Island medical evacuations. The Australian federal police announced late on Friday afternoon they had dropped their investigation into how the security briefing was leaked to the media. The leaked advice, reported in the Australian, came during a heated political debate in February over the medical transfer bill, which ultimately passed parliament against the government\u2019s wishes. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said Dutton needed to clarify whether he or his office had anything to do with the leak. Albanese said he did not know who was behind the leak but there were curious circumstances around the timing. \u201cQuite clearly that sort of national security advice wasn\u2019t circulating around the [Parliament] on Post-it notes,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney on Saturday. \u201cThe leak [was] on the front page of the newspaper. Peter Dutton gave an interview on the record where he spoke about that national security advice on that day. That was entirely inappropriate for him to do so and he did so too in order to secure a political advantage,\u201d he said. The newspaper report quoting home affairs department advice earned an extraordinary rebuke from Australia\u2019s top spy chief for misrepresenting the advice as coming from Asio. The federal police received a referral from the home affairs department on 7 February to investigate the alleged unauthorised disclosure of protected information. A spokeswoman said it had been assessed according to standard protocols. \u201cDue to the limited prospects of identifying a suspect, it was not accepted for investigation,\u201d an AFP spokeswoman said in a statement. \u201cThe AFP considers this matter finalised.\u201d Labor\u2019s home affairs spokeswoman, Kristina Keneally, said the decision not to investigate the leak was an \u201cabsolutely breathtaking development\u201d. \u201cIn light of this week\u2019s media raids, many Australian citizens and media outlets will have questions about why some leaks of classified information lead to raids and other leaks do not,\u201d Keneally said. Keneally said a perception of bias was being created whereby only leaks that embarrassed the government were investigated with rigour. \u201cThere is that very real perception of bias and interference, and that problem lies with the government,\u201d she told reporters in Sydney. The federal police have been under fire this week after two days of unprecedented media raids. Officers raided the home of News Corp Australia journalist Annika Smethurst investigating the publication of a leaked proposal to allow government spying on Australians. Then the ABC was targeted over a series of articles the broadcaster ran in 2017 into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The ABC\u2019s chair, Ita Buttrose, has said raids by the federal police on its headquarters were \u201cdesigned to intimidate\u201d and warned the government she would fight \u201cany attempts to muzzle\u201d the national broadcaster. The former journalist and publisher said she had registered her \u201cgrave concern\u201d about the raids on the ABC and News Corp over two days and would not countenance any interference with the public\u2019s right to know. \u201cAn untrammeled media is important to the public discourse and to democracy,\u201d Buttrose said. \u201cIt is the way in which Australian citizens are kept informed about the world and its impact on their daily lives.\u201d",

Priscilla Brooten was formally reported missing in December last year but the 46-year-old was last seen in July, in Bracken Ridge. The police confirmed that the cold case disappearance was now a homicide investigation. They were also forensically examining the house and a car at the property. \u201cI can confirm there\u2019s a 42-year-old gentleman from Bracken Ridge who is assisting police with their inquiries,\u201d detective senior sergeant Michael Hogan told reporters in Brisbane on Saturday. The pair had been in a relationship for a year before Brooten disappeared and police say the man failed to report her missing. Brooten has been described as an outgoing and friendly yoga and Zumba enthusiast. Police dogs had pinpointed a narrow strip of land in the front yard alongside the driveway where the search was concentrated. Brooten\u2019s blue Volkswagen Golf hatchback was found abandoned in Bunton Street, Scarborough about 9pm on Friday, 6 July 2018, and police had urged people who might have seen it to come forward. They believe the car was moved from Bracken Ridge. Hogan said Brooten was a keen gamer and appealed to her friends in the online gaming community to come forward with information. \u201cIt is certainly a possibility that we are keen to explore,\u201d he said. \u201cThey might not have even known she was missing.\u201d Brooten\u2019s mother and daughter live in California and have been kept up to date with the search.

      "body": "<p>Good-quality chicken that\u2019s been reared slowly outdoors using the best environmental farming methods, isn\u2019t cheap, but it can be economical. If you use every last morsel, a high-quality, plump bird can be broken down into 12 or more portions costing less than \u00a31.50 each. Your butcher may even do all the work for you, separating it into drumsticks, thighs, breasts, wings, bones, head, feet and giblets.

After an ultraviolent warm-up, everyone\u2019s favourite international assassin heads for London to get her revenge. Mike Bradley D-Day 75: Return to the Beaches 6pm, BBC Two Three hundred veterans of the largest seaborne landing operation ever staged board a ship to return to the D-day beaches in Normandy to commemorate the thousands of their comrades who never made it home. Touchingly, one former soldier says he just wants to \u201craise a salute to the real heroes\u201d.

The third series kicks off with a particularly seasoned guest list as Martine McCutcheon, Les Dennis, Alison Hammond and Sir Tom Courtenay heroically send themselves up in service to Harry\u2019s daft skits and silly bits, including an unexpected tribute to Raiders of the Lost Ark.

So begins a new series of The Voice Kids, with Jessie J joining coaches Will.i.am, Danny Jones and Pixie Lott.

      "bodyText": "When Harry spoke to the press in his dazed and delighted way after Meghan had given birth, he said: \u201cHow any woman does what they do is beyond comprehension.\u201d I guess he meant labour, childbirth, that everyday agony and ecstasy that is part of women\u2019s lives. How do we do that? After months of feeling not too grand while exposed to every myth going and being told what to eat, wear and how to behave, we have to get the baby out somehow. It\u2019s what we do. Some women love being pregnant, some really don\u2019t. Some sail through feeling mostly normal; others are sick, exhausted, permanently worried and just want it to end. Being pregnant is an ordinary thing that happens to women and yet it is absolutely extraordinary. Few tell the whole truth about it, as so often we are told to enjoy what is the most dangerous and precarious rollercoaster we will ever get on. I remember a woman telling me when I was first pregnant that the whole deal was like \u201ca major car accident\u201d and that it would take me two years to get over it. Wow, thanks mate. Luckily I was young enough to carry on life as normal \u2013 but each woman is different and each pregnancy is different. None of us are helped by exhortations to be blooming, nor by the assumption that we have joined some communal petting zoo in which strangers can pat our bellies or give us unsolicited advice about cheese and wine. Some women are traumatised by the whole experience because it is so primal, so totally blood and guts (have you ever seen a placenta?) and yet we have built an entire culture of fluff and cuteness around baby stuff as if in complete denial. Growing another person inside you and then pushing them out or having them cut out of you (if you think I am being too graphic, I wonder if you know where babies come from) is as basic as it gets. Let no one tell us that female biology is somehow a construct. Uterus transplants remain a while away. Try telling a woman in the throes of labour that biology is optional and she may well deck you. So far, so female. But to be a woman is so often to be told what you already instinctively know by a man in authority. This time by one Herman Pontzer of Duke University, North Carolina, in a journal called Science Advances. He has been reviewing the world\u2019s most physically demanding pastimes. Obviously one is the Tour de France. Days and days on a bike; more than 2,000 miles and years of training to get a yellow top. These guys are working at maximum lung capacity. What heroes. What an endurance test. The human ability to extract energy from food shows us the limits of what our bodies can do. Certain athletes are burning several times the amount of calories at peak performance than they are at their resting metabolic rate. And guess what? So are pregnant and breastfeeding women, who are of course pregnant for a lot longer than the duration of the Tour de France. \u201cIf you think about pregnancy, it is the ultimate endurance activity,\u201d concludes Pontzer. Apparently, Ironman triathlons and polar trekking don\u2019t come close to the body energy expenditure of being pregnant, with rates levelling off after 20 or so days on the road. What is key is the metabolic resting rate: marathon runners perform at 16 times theirs, cyclists at five times and an Antarctic trekker at 3.5 times. In contrast, a pregnant woman, who is usually working and carrying on as normal, is functioning at 2.2 times her resting rate. But she will do this for 280 days, something these mega athletes could only dream of. No one cheers pregnant women over the finishing line. None of us get a trophy. A normal pregnancy is not an illness but it certainly feels like an endurance test: perhaps I didn\u2019t need a study to tell me that, but we have one anyway. Growing new humans is the hardest work any of us do. We don\u2019t need medals for it, although some actual support would be nice. Yes, I am looking at you guys who don\u2019t offer seats on the bus to pregnant women. Yes, I am looking at all you employers who think maternity pay is unearned and optional.

      "body": "<p>It started with Michael Jackson. It was 2014, and Mira Jacob\u2019s six-year-old son Z had moved on from being obsessed with Freddie Mercury (\u201cHe demanded fake moustaches for a solid year\u201d), to being obsessed with Jackson. He knew all the moves and was never without a fedora. \u201cSo my husband and I, thinking we were geniuses, got him all the albums,\u201d Jacob explains. \u201cThe problem is, when you give a mixed-race kid albums from the trajectory of Michael Jackson\u2019s career, he gets really puzzled.\u201d And so the questions started: What colour was Jackson? How did he turn white? Why did he want to turn white?</p> <p>\u201cThe funny part was that Z didn\u2019t even know at that point what colour he was himself,\u201d Jacob says. \u201cHe would say things like, \u2018You\u2019re brown! Daddy\u2019s white!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Around the same time, Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\" title=\"\">shot dead by </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/12/ferguson-missouri-shooting-michael-brown-civil-rights-police-brutality\" title=\"\">police in Ferguson</a>, Missouri. Z started connecting the dots and \u201casking whether that\u2019s why someone would turn white \u2013 so that what happened in Ferguson doesn\u2019t happen to them? I could see it forming in his head,\u201d says Jacob: \u201c\u2018Is it not OK to be a brown person?\u2019; \u2018What is this that\u2019s happening?\u2019 Those questions are really hard to answer when Trump is rising and it\u2019s clearly not OK to be a brown person.\u201d</p> <p>Over the next few years, Z\u2019s questions, and Jacob\u2019s answers, turned into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/racism-bigotry-good-talk-graphic-novel-excerpt\" title=\"\">graphic </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/20/racism-bigotry-good-talk-graphic-novel-excerpt\" title=\"\">journal</a>, Good Talk: A Memoir In Conversations. Z\u2019s questions growing up as a half-Jewish, half-Indian, all-American kid in Brooklyn are interspersed with Jacob\u2019s experience growing up in New Mexico, the daughter of Indian immigrants.</p> <p>When Jacob first pitched the book to publishers in 2015, she imagined it would be a lot funnier (although it is still a funny book). \u201cI thought the clear arc was that things are getting very tense right now but we are going to come out of this moment.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t happen. Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cSo when America changed, the book changed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I think he thinks the president doesn\u2019t like kids who look like him. That\u2019s a complicated thing to figure out</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cFor years I had been telling myself that America was changing for the better, and that the pain and confusion I\u2019d felt growing up here would soon be a thing of the past,\u201d Jacob writes at the beginning of Good Talk. \u201cNow every question Z asked me made me realise the growing gap between the America I\u2019d been raised to believe in and the one rising fast all around us.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t to say, of course, that America hasn\u2019t changed for the better in many ways. It\u2019s worth remembering that interracial marriage was still illegal as recently as 50 years ago. Now families like Jacob\u2019s are increasingly common. \u201cSo Z doesn\u2019t feel singled out. But I think he thinks the president doesn\u2019t like kids who look like him. That\u2019s a complicated thing to figure out.\u201d</p> <p>Also complicated is trying to strike a balance between protecting your brown son from a world in which he won\u2019t always be welcome, and preparing him for it. \u201cThat is the question of the decade \u2013 and I don\u2019t have a great answer, other than I try to answer the question I\u2019m asked and not the pile of things I am anxious about in my head.</p> <p>\u201cPlenty of our parent friends have teenage black and brown sons, and have had to prepare them for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/oct/09/how-20-years-of-stop-and-search-has-widened-americas-racial-divide\" title=\"\">stop-and-frisk incidents</a>. So when Z asked me about Ferguson, I started thinking about that. My brain wants to tell him, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the thing you\u2019re going to need to know for the next 10 years of your life.\u2019 Then I have to stop myself and say, he doesn\u2019t need to know that yet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da67a1810dfe327e94f7c0cb5a8550fa6c6602eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da67a1810dfe327e94f7c0cb5a8550fa6c6602eb/7_23_1267_910/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mira Jacob with her husband Jed Rothstein and son in 2015.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"718\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mira Jacob with her husband Jed Rothstein and son in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: courtesy of Jed Rothstein</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are moments of brightness, however. Jacob remembers that one day, when Z was reeling from watching the news, she suggested they watch a Netflix special by the Indian-American comedian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/17/hari-kondabolu-american-hour-soho-theatre-the-problem-with-apu-death-threats-interview\" title=\"\">Hari Kondabolu</a>. \u201cWe watched it [and Z] was laughing so hard, and getting this idea \u2013 which I never had growing up \u2013 that Indians are cool. \u2018Look how cool this guy is! This guy is so funny!\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Oh, thank you Hari Kondabolu \u2013 you have saved us today.\u2019\u201d</p> <p> How do you strike a balance between protecting a curious, news-loving child from what is happening in the world, while keeping them educated and informed? It\u2019s difficult. Jacob has resorted to turning off the news a lot lately, in an attempt to keep some of the ugliness out.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The white side of the family tell him race doesn\u2019t matter</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it\u2019s not always possible. In 2017, white nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, among other things: \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d Jacob remembers Z turning away from the TV and asking: \u201cIs it bad to be brown and Jewish because those are two things no one likes?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt that moment, my heart is pounding for my son,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m furious and terrified. Whenever I\u2019m that scared, I feel like my parental reaction is to throw myself to a very calm place so I\u2019m not projecting the anxiety I feel.\u201d</p> <p>Do people ever tell Z race doesn\u2019t matter? \u201cOf course. Yeah, the entire white side of the family would say that to him. It\u2019s always interesting when people who never experience something say it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s sort of like saying: \u2018Your experience, whatever you might be feeling, just doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 The line that I\u2019ve kind of stuck to with him is: all of your white family, even when they say these baffling things, they do love you. They might not always know the right thing to say, and they might say things that upset you sometimes, and you should tell them.\u201d</p> <p>In recent years, politics has become increasingly personal on both sides of the Atlantic. Jacob\u2019s in-laws supported Trump, but wouldn\u2019t broach the subject with her, thinking it was better not to talk about it. \u201cAnd I thought, well, that\u2019s very convenient for you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel like my skin is coming off every time I walk into this house.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s hard, because of course Jacob loves her in-laws and they love her. \u201c[But] this isn\u2019t about love.

      "bodyText": "It started with Michael Jackson. It was 2014, and Mira Jacob\u2019s six-year-old son Z had moved on from being obsessed with Freddie Mercury (\u201cHe demanded fake moustaches for a solid year\u201d), to being obsessed with Jackson. He knew all the moves and was never without a fedora. \u201cSo my husband and I, thinking we were geniuses, got him all the albums,\u201d Jacob explains. \u201cThe problem is, when you give a mixed-race kid albums from the trajectory of Michael Jackson\u2019s career, he gets really puzzled.\u201d And so the questions started: What colour was Jackson? How did he turn white? Why did he want to turn white? \u201cThe funny part was that Z didn\u2019t even know at that point what colour he was himself,\u201d Jacob says. \u201cHe would say things like, \u2018You\u2019re brown! Daddy\u2019s white!\u2019\u201d Around the same time, Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was shot dead by police in Ferguson, Missouri. Z started connecting the dots and \u201casking whether that\u2019s why someone would turn white \u2013 so that what happened in Ferguson doesn\u2019t happen to them? I could see it forming in his head,\u201d says Jacob: \u201c\u2018Is it not OK to be a brown person?\u2019; \u2018What is this that\u2019s happening?\u2019 Those questions are really hard to answer when Trump is rising and it\u2019s clearly not OK to be a brown person.\u201d Over the next few years, Z\u2019s questions, and Jacob\u2019s answers, turned into a graphic journal, Good Talk: A Memoir In Conversations. Z\u2019s questions growing up as a half-Jewish, half-Indian, all-American kid in Brooklyn are interspersed with Jacob\u2019s experience growing up in New Mexico, the daughter of Indian immigrants. When Jacob first pitched the book to publishers in 2015, she imagined it would be a lot funnier (although it is still a funny book). \u201cI thought the clear arc was that things are getting very tense right now but we are going to come out of this moment.\u201d Of course, that didn\u2019t happen. Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cSo when America changed, the book changed. \u201cFor years I had been telling myself that America was changing for the better, and that the pain and confusion I\u2019d felt growing up here would soon be a thing of the past,\u201d Jacob writes at the beginning of Good Talk. \u201cNow every question Z asked me made me realise the growing gap between the America I\u2019d been raised to believe in and the one rising fast all around us.\u201d This isn\u2019t to say, of course, that America hasn\u2019t changed for the better in many ways. It\u2019s worth remembering that interracial marriage was still illegal as recently as 50 years ago. Now families like Jacob\u2019s are increasingly common. \u201cSo Z doesn\u2019t feel singled out. But I think he thinks the president doesn\u2019t like kids who look like him. That\u2019s a complicated thing to figure out.\u201d Also complicated is trying to strike a balance between protecting your brown son from a world in which he won\u2019t always be welcome, and preparing him for it. \u201cThat is the question of the decade \u2013 and I don\u2019t have a great answer, other than I try to answer the question I\u2019m asked and not the pile of things I am anxious about in my head. \u201cPlenty of our parent friends have teenage black and brown sons, and have had to prepare them for stop-and-frisk incidents. So when Z asked me about Ferguson, I started thinking about that. My brain wants to tell him, \u2018OK, here\u2019s the thing you\u2019re going to need to know for the next 10 years of your life.\u2019 Then I have to stop myself and say, he doesn\u2019t need to know that yet.\u201d There are moments of brightness, however. Jacob remembers that one day, when Z was reeling from watching the news, she suggested they watch a Netflix special by the Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu. \u201cWe watched it [and Z] was laughing so hard, and getting this idea \u2013 which I never had growing up \u2013 that Indians are cool. \u2018Look how cool this guy is! This guy is so funny!\u2019 I was, like, \u2018Oh, thank you Hari Kondabolu \u2013 you have saved us today.\u2019\u201d How do you strike a balance between protecting a curious, news-loving child from what is happening in the world, while keeping them educated and informed? It\u2019s difficult. Jacob has resorted to turning off the news a lot lately, in an attempt to keep some of the ugliness out. But it\u2019s not always possible. In 2017, white nationalists marched on Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting, among other things: \u201cJews will not replace us!\u201d Jacob remembers Z turning away from the TV and asking: \u201cIs it bad to be brown and Jewish because those are two things no one likes?\u201d \u201cAt that moment, my heart is pounding for my son,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m furious and terrified. Whenever I\u2019m that scared, I feel like my parental reaction is to throw myself to a very calm place so I\u2019m not projecting the anxiety I feel.\u201d Do people ever tell Z race doesn\u2019t matter? \u201cOf course. Yeah, the entire white side of the family would say that to him. It\u2019s always interesting when people who never experience something say it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s sort of like saying: \u2018Your experience, whatever you might be feeling, just doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 The line that I\u2019ve kind of stuck to with him is: all of your white family, even when they say these baffling things, they do love you. They might not always know the right thing to say, and they might say things that upset you sometimes, and you should tell them.\u201d In recent years, politics has become increasingly personal on both sides of the Atlantic. Jacob\u2019s in-laws supported Trump, but wouldn\u2019t broach the subject with her, thinking it was better not to talk about it. \u201cAnd I thought, well, that\u2019s very convenient for you,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I feel like my skin is coming off every time I walk into this house.\u201d It\u2019s hard, because of course Jacob loves her in-laws and they love her. \u201c[But] this isn\u2019t about love. I think that\u2019s the part that\u2019s hardest for them to understand. When they talk to me they say, \u2018We want you to know we love you.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018I know that. You are wonderful to me on many levels. You are also ignoring this thing which is terrifying and true. You are making the country less safe for me and my son.

Fallon said the row over abortion was a microcosm of the kind of challenges Biden might encounter at the progressive gatherings he has thus far avoided. \u201cThere\u2019s been a recognition that the backbone of the party are people of color and women,\u201d he said, while adding the Biden campaign had \u201cmisjudged\u201d the temperature within the party on abortion rights. \u201cIt is not an issue that you can \u2018find a middle ground on\u2019. \u201cI suspect that there\u2019s going to be more issues that are going to come up where his approach of positioning himself as the centrist \u2013 and appealing to the moderates of the party \u2013 is going to run headlong into some positions where they might think they can stiff arm the left, but in the context of a debate stage are not going to play well.\u201d",

Kawhi Leonard (36 points and 12 rebounds) nailed back-to-back three-pointers in the opening minute of the second-half to give the Raptors their first lead of the game, 48-46. The Raptors went on to outscore the Warriors 37-21 in the period, turning an 11-point first-quarter deficit into a 13-point third quarter advantage, a 24-point reversal. The Raptors outshot the Warriors, 54.5% to 35% in the period. And they made five of their seven three-point attempts, after shooting a dismal 2-for-17 from beyond the arc in the first half.</p> <p>\u201cKawhi\u2019s two big threes to start the half really I thought changed the whole feel of everybody,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cI just thought everybody was like, \u2018OK, man, we know we are here. Let\u2019s go.\u2019 And we just kind of kept going.\u201d</p> <p>The shellshocked Warriors cut their hole to eight points with just under three minutes left after Stephen Curry made a three-pointer, but they couldn\u2019t complete the comeback. The Warriors, so famous for their third-quarter pushes, finally got a taste of their own medicine.</p> <p>\u201cIt sucks really bad,\u201d said Draymond Green, who finished with 10 points, nine rebounds and 12 assists. \u201cYou just try and do whatever you can to change it. Get a stop, get a bucket, get some momentum. Every time we did, they answered.\u201d</p> <p>It was a surprising turn of events considering the Raptors struggled from the get-go, with Leonard scoring 14 of the team\u2019s 17 first-quarter points. The rest of the Raptors were a dismal 1-for-13 from the field in the first 12 minutes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc6490b373c768a798ab730476907e14f255676c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6490b373c768a798ab730476907e14f255676c/0_52_4696_2820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Warriors bench takes in their second home loss in two games\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Warriors bench takes in their second home loss in two games.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Margot/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the Raptors managed to stay in the game despite shooting 34.1% from the field in the first half, entering halftime trailing by just four points, 46-42. The Warriors greatly helped them along the way, notching 10 turnovers during the period, en route to a woeful 19 in the game.</p> <p>\u201cI had faith that it was going to turn around for us,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe were missing a lot of wide-open shots.\u201d</p> <p>Leonard led the Raptors with a NBA finals career-high 36 points on 11-for-22 shooting, including making five of his nine three-point shots.

      "bodyText": "The Toronto Raptors have accomplished the improbable, beating the two-time defending NBA champion Golden State Warriors twice on their home court to push them to the brink of elimination. With a 105-92 win in Friday night\u2019s Game 4 of the NBA finals, the Raptors took a commanding 3-1 series lead. They are now one win away from the franchise\u2019s first ever championship, while the powerhouse Warriors\u2019 season dangles by a thread. Toronto broke it open during a stunning third quarter. Kawhi Leonard (36 points and 12 rebounds) nailed back-to-back three-pointers in the opening minute of the second-half to give the Raptors their first lead of the game, 48-46. The Raptors went on to outscore the Warriors 37-21 in the period, turning an 11-point first-quarter deficit into a 13-point third quarter advantage, a 24-point reversal. The Raptors outshot the Warriors, 54.5% to 35% in the period. And they made five of their seven three-point attempts, after shooting a dismal 2-for-17 from beyond the arc in the first half. \u201cKawhi\u2019s two big threes to start the half really I thought changed the whole feel of everybody,\u201d Raptors coach Nick Nurse said. \u201cI just thought everybody was like, \u2018OK, man, we know we are here. Let\u2019s go.\u2019 And we just kind of kept going.\u201d The shellshocked Warriors cut their hole to eight points with just under three minutes left after Stephen Curry made a three-pointer, but they couldn\u2019t complete the comeback. The Warriors, so famous for their third-quarter pushes, finally got a taste of their own medicine. \u201cIt sucks really bad,\u201d said Draymond Green, who finished with 10 points, nine rebounds and 12 assists. \u201cYou just try and do whatever you can to change it. Get a stop, get a bucket, get some momentum. Every time we did, they answered.\u201d It was a surprising turn of events considering the Raptors struggled from the get-go, with Leonard scoring 14 of the team\u2019s 17 first-quarter points. The rest of the Raptors were a dismal 1-for-13 from the field in the first 12 minutes. But the Raptors managed to stay in the game despite shooting 34.1% from the field in the first half, entering halftime trailing by just four points, 46-42. The Warriors greatly helped them along the way, notching 10 turnovers during the period, en route to a woeful 19 in the game. \u201cI had faith that it was going to turn around for us,\u201d Leonard said. \u201cWe were missing a lot of wide-open shots.\u201d Leonard led the Raptors with a NBA finals career-high 36 points on 11-for-22 shooting, including making five of his nine three-point shots. He also had 12 rebounds and four steals. Serge Ibaka had 20 points on 9-for-12 shooting and two blocked shots. Pascal Siakam added 19 points. Fred VanVleet had a bit of a scare after getting inadvertently elbowed in the face by Shaun Livingston with 9:35 left. VanVleet laid on the court for a few moments bleeding with a cut under his right eye. He went on to have seven stitches and was cleared to return. He did not suffer a concussion. Klay Thompson, who missed Game 3 because of a left hamstring sprain that he sustained in Game 2, returned for Game 4. He opened the game with 14 points in 16 minutes on six-for-nine shooting. Normally even-keeled and understated, Thompson couldn\u2019t help losing himself in celebration after making a turnaround jumper with 3:48 left in the first half to put the Warriors up, 42-34. He pointed his finger toward the floor while emphatically nodding his head and even made an obscene gesture with his hands while running downcourt. But the Raptors went on to spoil his return, despite him finishing with a team-high 28 points on 11-for-18 shooting, including 6-for-10 shooting from beyond the arc. Stephen Curry had 27 points, but it took him 22 shots to get them. Kevon Looney (right 1st costal cartilage non-displaced fracture) also returned in Game 4 after he was initially ruled out for the rest of the finals after sustaining the injury in Game 2. He gave the Warriors a boost off the bench with 10 points on 5-for-8 shooting. Kevin Durant missed his ninth straight playoff game because of a right calf strain. Warriors\u2019 coach Steve Kerr said he\u2019s hopeful that he\u2019ll return in Game 5 or 6 \u2013 if there is one. It was an emotional, frenetic contest with nine lead changes. But the Raptors got the best of the experienced Warriors, and they did it in a dramatic fashion in front of a hostile crowd. Now they\u2019re just one game away from making history.",

Either way, we could see something memorable and it could come about as soon as Monday\u2019s Game 5 when the series continues, and possibly concludes, in Toronto. One can only imagine what the atmosphere will be like then. </p> <p>We will continue to cover the NBA Finals here at the Guardian until its conclusion, but this will be all of today\u2019s live coverage.

Despite a disjointed first half performance, the Raptors found themselves in the second half. Kawhi Leonard had a spectacular game, he scored 36 points and racked up 12 rebounds, and Serge Ibaka was absolutely ridiculous of the bench. Right now, they very much look like the better team, with an emphasis on \u201cteam.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfb2e208f08ff012e2707c3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-08T03:41:37.673Z\">4.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Email from Dan Carter:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So this is the whole story, right?

His behavior, which included directly cursing out Lowry, has led to universal condemnation around the NBA. Lowry seemed to speak for players in general <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/06/warriors-fan-ejected-shoving-kyle-lowry\">with his comments</a> about Stevens:</p> <p> \u201cThere\u2019s no place for that.

In a stretch of games where the Golden State Warriors have been without Kevin Durant, their best player, the Raptors won an emotional Game 1 at home and then took advantage of the additional absences of Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/05/nba-finals-game-3-toronto-raptors-golden-state-warriors-basketball\">in Game 3</a>. With that, the Raptors struck their opponents when they\u2019ve been at their weakest and now lead the series 2-1.</p> <p>To say this is not to deny the Raptors their due credit. Heck, they even had their chances in Game 2 where they had a genuine chance to tie the game in the final minute. In an alternate universe, they have a 3-0 lead in the Finals right now. They\u2019ve done all of this without even a hero game from Kawhi Leonard yet.<br></p> <p>Now it\u2019s the Warriors who have a must-win before them as they can\u2019t afford to fall to 3-1. Golden State is too banged up and the Raptors are too formidable of an opponent for them to just assume that they can pull off three straight wins, two of them on the road. The good news for the Warriors is that the reinforcements are coming. While Durant is still out, Thompson and (somehow) Kevon Looney, playing with a broken collarbone, will be returning for tonight\u2019s Game 4.</p> <p>While it\u2019s a shame that injuries have played a factor here, it can\u2019t be denied that this has become a quite interesting Finals to this point. In fact, it\u2019s difficult to predict where we\u2019re headed from here, which feels rather unusual considering the usual air of inevitability that accompanies the Warriors. Could Game 4 be the point where this series finally comes into focus? Let\u2019s find out together, shall we?

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s the game report So, we\u2019re either going to have the first NBA championship by a team from Canada or the Golden State Warriors are going to pull off a comeback after falling into a 3-1 Finals deficit. Either way, we could see something memorable and it could come about as soon as Monday\u2019s Game 5 when the series continues, and possibly concludes, in Toronto. One can only imagine what the atmosphere will be like then. We will continue to cover the NBA Finals here at the Guardian until its conclusion, but this will be all of today\u2019s live coverage. Thanks to everybody for following along, particularly those who contributed. Ciao! Still this wasn\u2019t about the Warriors losing, although that might be the sexier story, it was about a great game played by the Raptors. Despite a disjointed first half performance, the Raptors found themselves in the second half. Kawhi Leonard had a spectacular game, he scored 36 points and racked up 12 rebounds, and Serge Ibaka was absolutely ridiculous of the bench. Right now, they very much look like the better team, with an emphasis on \u201cteam.\u201d Email from Dan Carter: So this is the whole story, right? Toronto can own the \u2018regular\u2019 warriors, but Durant comes back at 1-3 down and they take it 4-3, assuring his status as an all timer, rather than a bandwagon-er. Well that\u2019s the hope for the Warriors but there\u2019s a lot of \u201cifs\u201d there and, again, two of the next three potential games will be in Toronto. Certainly, Kevin Durant will be the big story over the next few days. The Toronto Raptors have taken a 3-1 lead in the NBA Finals. Can you believe it? The Golden State Warriors are now a game away from elimination and we may have seen the last game ever played at Oracle Arena. Raptors 105-92 Warriors, FINAL Raptors just showing off not. Siakam rattles one home from around ten feet. At that point, both sides realize its over and Toronto holds for the final buzzer. The Raptors win! Raptors 103-92 Warriors, 1:28, 4th quarter Lowry gets the fans to start heading for the exits with his shot. Curry keeps things something close to interesting by completing a three-point play. Raptors 101-89 Warriors, 1:53, 4th quarter Siakam with a jumper. That might be the game right there. Raptors 99-89 Warriors, 2:48, 4th quarter Curry hits a three-pointer! There\u2019s life still here. Draymond Green decides to immediately suck all the momentum out of the game by pushing Siakam who goes to the line where he nails both of them. Just a completely boneheaded foul by Green. Raptors 97-86 Warriors, 3:05, 4th quarter Kawhi Leonard? He doesn\u2019t miss free throws. He increases Toronto\u2019s lead by beyond-calmly hitting two. Curry gets the points right back for the Warriors. They still have a pulse. Raptors 95-84 Warriors, 3:43, 4th quarter In other news, VanVleet has gotten stitched up and apparently doesn\u2019t have a concussion, which is good news. He\u2019s on the bench here. Iguodala gets to the line and makes\u2026 one of two free throws. Raptors fans are starting to feel it. Raptors 95-83 Warriors, 4:19, 4th quarter Missed opportunity for the Warriors to cut Toronto\u2019s lead into single-digits. Looney gets to the line but can\u2019t convert either shot. Inevitably, the Raptors respond. They keep a possession alive thanks to a Danny Green rebound and Siakam makes a layup. The Warriors call a timeout. Raptors 93-83 Warriors, 4:54, 4th quarter The Warriors start to chip away a bit after Draymond banks a shot home and Curry gets to the line where he makes both. It\u2019s a 10-point game and there\u2019s still plenty of time, especially considering Golden State\u2019s weapons. Raptors 93-81 Warriors, 6:08, 4th quarter The crowd gets loud at a Klay Thompson three-pointer but there\u2019s no stopping Serge Ibaka in this half and he lands a tremendous dunk to raise his total to 20 points. Raptors 91-76 Warriors, 7:34, 4th quarter Danny Green breaks his oh-fer with a trademark ridiculous three-pointer. Email from Kai Soltys, on the VanVleet injury: Fine the floor $500 000 and suspend it for a season Raptors 88-76 Warriors, 7:48, 4th quarter Can\u2019t say anything bad about Kevon Looney in this game. Draymond Green finds him for an alley-oop dunk and that\u2019s going to be enough to get Toronto to calm things down with a timeout. Raptors 88-74 Warriors, 8:19, 4th quarter Draymond Green gets Kawhi Leonard to pick up his fourth foul. Green grinds out two more free throws. Every one of those might be crucial for the Warriors. Raptors 88-72 Warriors, 8:33, 4th quarter Leonard with a three-pointer and it\u2019s a 16 point lead and\u2026 is this actually about to get away from the Warriors? Are we witnessing the end of an era right here and now? Raptors 85-72 Warriors, 8:57, 4th quarter Ibaka scores again and picks up a foul. He\u2019s not going to miss that free throw, not in this game. Raptors 82-72 Warriors, 9:35, 4th quarter VanVleet walks to the back on his own, he looks shaken up from the hit and I\u2019m shaken up just looking at him to be honest. Meanwhile, Ibaka has picked up a foul that puts Shaun Livingston on the line. He makes both free throws. Raptors 82-70 Warriors, 9:35, 4th quarter The two teams go on one of those offensive-challenged stretches of play before VanVleet hits the floor and he\u2019s bleeding from the eye. Raptors 82-70 Warriors, 11:28, 4th quarter Okay this is starting to get into dangerous territory for Golden State. VanVleet nails a three right off the bat, but Thompson does promptly answer. Email from Redmond Grimes: I was at the TFc game tonight. They are showing the Raptors on the big screen at the stadium and the beer is still flowing! I have to imagine that it\u2019s getting pretty loud after that offensive explosion. Raptors 79-67 Warriors, end of the 3rd quarter Leonard adds to the Raptors lead: two free throws and another jumper. The Warriors need to get something going here and it\u2019s going to be on Steph. He completes a three-point play after drawing a foul on Ibaka that cuts the lead to 10 points. There\u2019s no stopping Leonard though. The Raptors hold for the last shot before getting the ball to their main guy as VanVleet finds him for the final basket of the quarter. What a quarter for the Raptors who score 37 points in the frame. Raptors 73-64 Warriors, 1:21, 3rd quarter Ibaka has been Toronto\u2019s secret weapon. He scores again and it\u2019s an 8 point lead for the Raptors. Steph Curry gets to the line and, somehow, misses one of two free throws. That helps the Warriors a bit but it would help them more if they could stop Ibaka who scores YET again. Raptors 69-63 Warriors, 2:14, 3rd quarter Leonard gets back to the line where he should be paying rent. He hits both free throws to increase the Raptors lead. Phil Rawlinson: Hi hunter I am really enjoying this series but am a bit of a novice. With my ignorant hat on, it seems unfair one team has steph curry, hes really quite good. And yet Toronto are right at them I appreciate this adds nothing but I want Toronto to win Steph Curry really is a Human Cheat Code. Raptors 67-63 Warriors, 2:50, 3rd quarter You\u2019ll never believe it but Draymond Green just picked up a technical foul for saying something to an official. Leonard takes the technical free throw for Toronto and drills it. He also makes the next Raptors\u2019 basket. Warriors want another timeout here. \u201cRight Place, Wrong Time\u201d takes us to the commercial break. R.I.P. Dr. John, the Night Tripper. Raptors 64-63 Warriors, 3:17, 3rd quarter Curry gets to the line and of course he makes both free throws. What else do you expect from him? Raptors 64-61 Warriors, 4:00, 3rd quarter Siakam goes to the line for free throws and makes both. We\u2019re all tied up which sounds about right, neither team seems quite able to break away from the other. Although Ibaka wants to change that he hits a three to give the Raptors their biggest lead of the game. Raptors 59-61 Warriors, 4:29, 3rd quarter Thompson hits another three. Quite a different half here. And Lowry lands on his ankle awkwardly. He stays in the game however. Raptors 59-58 Warriors, 5:32, 3rd quarter Out of the timeout, Iguodala misses a layup. Gasol hits a three-pointer and the see-saw second half continues. Raptors 56-58 Warriors, 6:14, 3rd quarter Wow, an incredible block by Draymond Green on Pascal Siakam to prevent an easy score. The Warriors take a timeout. Raptors 56-58 Warriors, 6:39, 3rd quarter Draymond Green fouls Siakam on a made basket. Unlike Cousins, he completes the old-fashioned three pointer and the Raptors regain a lead for the blink of an eye before Thompson hits one from downtown. Raptors 53-55 Warriors, 7:36, 3rd quarter Raptors have regained their long-distance shooting. VanVleet nails his first three-pointer and then\u2026 should pick up a foul on the next position it feels like. Instead the Raptors end up turning the ball over. Raptors 50-55 Warriors, 8:29, 3rd quarter And Iguodala blocks a Kyle Lowry three out of bounds. Hey look, DeMarcus Cousins is doing something good too! He hits a jumper and picks up a foul\u2026 but he doesn\u2019t make the free throw to complete the three-point play. Raptors 50-53 Warriors, 9:33, 3rd quarter Gasol with a jumper, Toronto back up front for a split second. It doesn\u2019t last. Thompson scores yet again and, oh hey, Andre Iguodala sighting, he unleashes a vicious dunk. Raptors 48-49 Warriors, 10:36, 3rd quarter Leonard hits two three-pointers and just like that they have the lead. Briefly, Curry hits his first three of the game. Okay, this is looking more like what we were expecting. Raptors 42-46 Warriors, 12:00, 3rd quarter And the second half has begun! Email from Phil Rawlinson: Hi hunter Hope you are well. What do you call a donkey with three legs? Wonkey While I don\u2019t think this is actually related to this game in the slightest, this is also the punchline for \u201cWhat do you call a non-Kawhi Raptors player\u2019s shot for three points.\u201d The good news for the Warriors? The miraculous recoveries of Thompson and Looney: How bizarre was that first half offensively? There were exactly four three-pointers made. Leonard hit two for Toronto, Thompson hit two for the Warriors. That\u2019s it. How is that even possible? Is everybody tired? Raptors 42-46 Warriors, end of the first half And that will do it for the first half. What a sloppy weird first half. Warriors have the lead, the Raptors are right behind them though. Raptors 42-46 Warriors, 33.2 Gasol with a dunk and the Warriors cannot get much separation from the Raptors, who they\u2019re out-playing in just about every respect. Who knows where\u2019d they be without Looney, who dunks on Golden State\u2019s end. Lowry gets fouled and makes both free throws. Raptors 38-44 Warriors, 2:02, 2nd quarter Marc Gasol\u2019s been dead quiet, but he gets to the line and dutifully knocks down his free throws. Raptors 36-44 Warriors, 2:02, 2nd quarter Curry scores and we hit another stretch where neither team looks like they know what they\u2019re doing offensively. This has\u2026 this has not been super-great basketball to be honest. The Oracle crowd is appreciating it though. Raptors 36-42 Warriors, 3:31, 2nd quarter Lowry takes out his anger at the Warriors\u2019 ownership with a quick basket out of the timeout. Thompson can\u2019t connect on the other end this time around. Raptors 34-42 Warriors, 3:48, 2nd quarter Thompson drills another three. That\u2019s 12 points for him already. Wait, he just scored again, make that 14 points. Raptors are going to call a timeout. Raptors 34-37 Warriors, 4:40, 2nd quarter Curry with a jumper and Ibaka continues his great quarter by corralling a rebound and depositing it in the basket with a little hook shot. Lowry adds two free throws to Toronto\u2019s total and it\u2019s a one-possession game. Raptors 30-35 Warriors, 5:42, 2nd quarter Draymond Green scores and Oracle gets on their feet. Every time they seem to do that, the Raptors manage to score. This time around Siakam drives to the basket, finishes on the rim and picks up a foul. He successfully completes the three-point play at the line. Raptors 27-33 Warriors, 6:18, 2nd quarter Thompson scores out of the timeout. Medical staff looking pretty good right now for the Warriors. McKinnie gets fouled by Lowry, who has been fouling a bunch this series. He misses both free throws though. Raptors 27-31 Warriors, 6:59, 2nd quarter Thompson with a jumper, he doesn\u2019t look too bad either. Danny Green misses yet another shot, he hasn\u2019t a single one. Meanwhile, Livingston has made another. Golden State definitely playing with more energy now. And as soon as I type that, Toronto find a bit of a spark thanks to back-to-back baskets by VanVleet and Siakam and the Warriors are going to want to take a timeout here. Raptors 23-27 Warriors, 8:38, 2nd quarter Shaun Livingston scores for the Warriors and Ibaka hits his third shot of the quarter, a long two. Raptors 21-25 Warriors, 9:25, 2nd quarter Cousins and Ibaka trade baskets and then both teams go on one of those weird stretches where they can\u2019t score. Not really a smooth game so far. Raptors 19-23 Warriors, 11:32, 2nd quarter It looks like that Curry shot didn\u2019t beat the shot clock, so they take it off the board. Ibaka then makes the first shot of the game. That\u2019s one way to cut a lead down real quick on just one made basket. Raptors 17-25 Warriors, end of the 1st quarter Curry\u2019s layup is no good but Looney\u2019s tip-in is great. Raptors need a score here and, no surprise, it\u2019s Leonard who provides the spark by hitting two straight shots. That will do it for the first quarter. A crazy shot but a dominant stretch by the Warriors towards the end. Raptors 12-23 Warriors, 1:43, 1st quarter Alfonzo McKinnie scores and the Warriors already have a double-digit lead. Raptors 12-21 Warriors, 2:18, 1st quarter Raptors just have 2.9 to score but that\u2019s enough time for Leonard to heave up a shot to cut into the Warriors lead but Looney scores again. I guess that second opinion he got from the doctors wasn\u2019t a lie. Curry adds to the lead with a shot that may or may not have escaped being a shot clock violation. I\u2019ve hit the Stockholm Syndrome portion of watching the NBA Finals where I\u2019m starting to be curious about these cheesy ABC shows. Extreme mini-golf? I\u2019m starting to come around to the idea. Raptors 10-17 Warriors, 4:06, 1st quarter Leonard gets called on a foul. Draymond Green goes to the line and he\u2019s automatic as usual. Curry gets another three after a Fred VanVleet miss and the Raptors are going to cash in a timeout right here. Raptors 10-13 Warriors, 4:39, 1st quarter Klay Thompson with a beautiful three that\u2019s immediately answered by Lowry. Raptors 7-10 Warriors, 6:02, 1st quarter Danny Green misses an open look, proof that it sometimes happens. An alley-oop to Looney who scores to a huge hand from the Warriors fans. Leonard gets to the line, something he\u2019s been doing frequently this entire postseason, making both of his free throws. Raptors 5-8 Warriors, 6:45, 1st quarter Draymond Green makes the first bucket of the game. Leonard misses a three. On the other end, Cousins makes a layup. The crowd gets loud but Lowry quickly quiets them with a quick score. We reach our first timeout of the game. That was an\u2026 interesting start. Raptors 3-4 Warriors, 8:30, 1st quarter Siakam gets fouled by Cousins, which puts him on the line. He makes one of two free throws for the Raptors\u2019 first point. Thompson scores on one end, Leonard on the other. Okay now we\u2019re starting to cook here. Raptors 0-2 Warriors, 9:19, 1st quarter Warriors get a bunch of chances to score here and don\u2019t manage to do it. This is getting comical here. Siakam misses on Toronto\u2019s end. DeMarcus Cousins loses the grip on the ball, turns it over. Raptors again get a chance for the first score and THEY turn it over. Finally, Curry gets a jumper to go for the first score of the game. Raptors 0-0 Warriors, 10:43, 1st quarter Raptors don\u2019t score in their first possession. The Warriors turn it over on theirs. The Raptors turn it over\u2026 the Warriors turn it over. Green misses a three. Both teams are a little ragged to start things out here. Raptors 0-0 Warriors, 12:00, 1st quarter And we\u2019re off! \u201cThis could be the last game in Oracle Arena\u201d is the theme of the broadcast it seems. We\u2019re heading towards Opening Tip here after the post-pregame pregame finishes. Paul Pierce thinks the Raptors are winning today and tomorrow. Jalen Rose agrees with me that the Warriors win in double-digits tonight. I feel better about my prediction. A band called Walk Off The Earth play a weird folked-up version of \u201cO Canada.\u201d I, uh, appreciate the ingenuity but am not sure about the execution. Meanwhile, the \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d is performed by (rolls dice) Ne-Yo. Sure, why not. Golden State Warriors starters Steph Curry, G Klay Thompson, G Andre Iguodala, F Draymond Green, F DeMarcus Cousins, C NBA Commissioner Adam Silver joins \u201cNBA Countdown\u201d to talk about Mark Stevens\u2019s punishment: a 1 year ban and a $500,000 fine. Jalen Rose grills him on the size of the fine, which really does feel a bit like a slap on the wrist. Overall, the NBA seems to be handling this rather well, at least compared to say how you\u2019d expect the likes of a Roger Goodell to bungle it. Toronto Raptors starters Nothing shocking here. Kyle Lowry, G Danny Green, G Kawhi Leonard, F Pascal Siakam, F Marc Gasol, C Warriors fans and Raptors fans both going \u201cnot it, not it, not it,\u201d right now. Predictions So it\u2019s time for a prediction for tonight\u2019s game. Well, since I got my predictions right for Games 1 &amp; 2, I\u2019m feeling pretty cocky here. I\u2019m going to say that there\u2019s no way that the Warriors don\u2019t even it up tonight 2-2. Steph Curry remains red hot but this time around he will have help. Thompson will be back and the supporting cast will rebound from their rough Game 3. I say they win and win rather easily. Let\u2019s say a final score of about like 120-107. Agree? Disagree? Feel free to send your predictions here either through email (hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or Twitter (@HunterFelt). One person who will not be at Oracle Arena is Golden State Warriors part-owner Mark Stevens, who has been banned from the rest of the finals after his confrontation with the Raptors\u2019 Kyle Lowry in Game 3. His behavior, which included directly cursing out Lowry, has led to universal condemnation around the NBA. Lowry seemed to speak for players in general with his comments about Stevens: \u201cThere\u2019s no place for that. He had no reason to touch me. He had no reason to reach over two seats and then say some vulgar language to me. There\u2019s no place for people like that in our league.\u201d In one respect, the Toronto Raptors have only done what they absolutely had to do to have a realistic shot of winning the NBA Finals. In a stretch of games where the Golden State Warriors have been without Kevin Durant, their best player, the Raptors won an emotional Game 1 at home and then took advantage of the additional absences of Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney in Game 3. With that, the Raptors struck their opponents when they\u2019ve been at their weakest and now lead the series 2-1. To say this is not to deny the Raptors their due credit. Heck, they even had their chances in Game 2 where they had a genuine chance to tie the game in the final minute. In an alternate universe, they have a 3-0 lead in the Finals right now. They\u2019ve done all of this without even a hero game from Kawhi Leonard yet. Now it\u2019s the Warriors who have a must-win before them as they can\u2019t afford to fall to 3-1. Golden State is too banged up and the Raptors are too formidable of an opponent for them to just assume that they can pull off three straight wins, two of them on the road. The good news for the Warriors is that the reinforcements are coming. While Durant is still out, Thompson and (somehow) Kevon Looney, playing with a broken collarbone, will be returning for tonight\u2019s Game 4. While it\u2019s a shame that injuries have played a factor here, it can\u2019t be denied that this has become a quite interesting Finals to this point. In fact, it\u2019s difficult to predict where we\u2019re headed from here, which feels rather unusual considering the usual air of inevitability that accompanies the Warriors. Could Game 4 be the point where this series finally comes into focus? Let\u2019s find out together, shall we? As always, you can contribute to this blog by either sending us email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweets (to @HunterFelt). Opening tip is set sometime around 9:00pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back before then to document the leadup to Game 4 of the NBA Finals between the Toronto Raptors and the Golden State Warriors at Oracle Arena. Hunter will be here shortly. In the meantime here\u2019s Oliver Connolly\u2019s look back at Game 3.",

      "bodyText": "Lawns are turning brown, playing fields are becoming dustbowls and residents are cutting back on household water use as water restrictions prompted by the continuing drought intensify. Parched front and backyards in regional towns across central and western parts of New South Wales are particularly under strain from the big dry, and could be pushed to the brink as councils clamp down on sprinkler use, ban the watering of lawns or mandate the use of only grey water for this purpose. Orange, Armidale and Tamworth have moved to stage four water restrictions in recent months. Tamworth\u2019s Chaffey Dam has dropped to a capacity of 24.2% and Armidale\u2019s Malpas Dam to 51% while at Orange, the combined storage of the Suma Park and Spring Creek dams is at 35.99%. The Tamworth mayor, Col Murray, says that if nothing changes, the town of 62,000 people will have about a year\u2019s supply of water left. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t rain, we\u2019ll inevitably go to level five restrictions. That will happen before Christmas,\u201d he says. Sue McLean, a former Tamworth nursery owner, says there are no green nature strips in town and a lot of plants that have been coping with the dry conditions are now succumbing to winter frost. \u201cPeople find it difficult in the winter time because although you may be able to bucket grey water, if it\u2019s already dark and cold when you get home from work, the last thing you want to do is go out and bucket water,\u201d she says. \u201cThe elderly can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s heartbreaking because they are house proud and keen gardeners.\u201d At her grandchildren\u2019s primary school, pupils have to eat their lunch inside because the playground has become too dusty. For the next couple of weeks, the school has arranged with the council for the children to be taken to a public park across the street to play on the grass. McLean says people in Tamworth had been \u201cscoffing\u201d when they read headlines in January that Sydney residents could be hit with a $40 increase in water bills. It\u2019s an insignificant amount, she says, when compared with price increases in regional areas. \u201cOnce upon a time it was government for everybody and you weren\u2019t crucified for living in a less urban area,\u201d she says. Almost two hours south at Murrurundi, water restrictions have been at level six since July last year. Residents have been asked to reduce their water consumption from an average of 166 litres per person per day to 140 litres. Upper Hunter shire councillor Josh Brown says people have been encouraged to have three-minute showers and reduce their washing-machine use to two loads a week. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a family of four, or five or six, that\u2019s pretty tough,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you\u2019re having a bath or bathing your kids, you can have one 10cm deep bath per person per day.\u201d In January, the council started carting water to Murrurundi, which has a population of about 1,000. The bulk of its water supply comes from an emergency bore and the town is pinning hopes on a pipeline project to Scone next year. Walgett, west of Tamworth, has had to rely on bore water for drinking for almost 18 months after the rivers ran dry. Level five water restrictions started on Thursday, mandating that only grey water could be used for residential gardens, car washing and window cleaning. This week, the town\u2019s only supermarket burnt down, prompting the NSW agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, to tell state parliament the township \u201cis on its knees\u201d. Walgett shire deputy mayor Ian Woodcock says the mood in town \u201cis not very good\u201d. Drought conditions delayed the start of the local rugby league season because the ground was too dry. Tens of thousands of dollars have gone into re-grassing the football field, with a grant from the NRL. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t water it this year, we had to let most of it die,\u201d Woodcock says. \u201cWe\u2019ve started to water it again [with bore water] and it\u2019s starting to come good.\u201d Bathurst adopted stage three water restrictions last November and the council is considering more drastic measures in coming months, while Sydney-siders were hit with stage one water restrictions at the start of June. Garden Clubs of Australia president George Hoad, who frequently travels around NSW and interstate inspecting gardens, says climate change and drought will force a dramatic rethink of how Australians plan their garden. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve had a garden you\u2019ve created or it was your parents\u2019 and it\u2019s been there for 30, 40, 50, 60 years and suddenly there is no water to water those shrubs and trees and plants, and you have to watch them die one by one \u2013 it\u2019s like losing a child in some ways, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t have the elaborate English gardens anymore \u2026 I love big English colourful borders, but they are just not practical. So my remedy is to slip across to the Chelsea Flower show every second year and visit some English gardens.\u201d Hoad began establishing his six-acre garden on the NSW\u2019s mid-north coast near Taree in 2005 and is reliant on water tanks and a half-full dam to keep it alive. \u201cI\u2019ve had to pull back a bit on more extravagant plantings of annuals, perennials, lots of colour, that\u2019s gone hand-in-hand with the drought over the past four or five years,\u201d he says. \u201cYou dig a hole and it\u2019s bone dry.\u201d Despite the gloomy climate outlook, he is amazed by the resilience of gardeners. \u201cAlways with a smile on their face, they say \u2018oh it might rain next week\u2019,\u201d he says. Water restrictions outside NSW aren\u2019t as tough. In Western Australia, there is a winter sprinkler ban in place for Perth, Mandurah and the state\u2019s south-west including Albany. Melbourne\u2019s water storage is at 49.9%, its lowest level since 2011 when the city was still recovering from the millennium drought. Melbourne Water says the downward trend in storage levels over the past five years reflects population-driven growth in demand and less water entering reservoirs. While Melbourne does not have water restrictions, there is a voluntary target for householders to reduce their consumption to 155 litres per person per day. The Victorian opposition wants a return to restrictions for the city but the state government has ruled that out for now. Instead, the Andrews government ordered in March for 125 gigalitres of water (or the equivalent of 55,500 Olympic swimming pools) for the 2019-20 financial year from the state\u2019s desalination plant. In Tasmania, a lack of significant rain and continuing dry conditions on King Island have resulted in TasWater extending level two water restrictions for Currie until 30 June. South Australia has permanent \u201cwater wise\u201d measures, which allow households to water gardens and lawns by hand at any time with a trigger nozzle hose, a watering can, bucket, or a drip-feed irrigation system. Sprinklers can be used for watering before 10am, or after 5pm.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along! Some key links and events from the day: US and Mexico reached an agreement to stave off import tariffs on Mexican goods, officials announced late Friday. The president sparked confusion when he tweeted about his administration\u2019s space policy, saying, \u201cFor all of the money we are spending, NASA should NOT be talking about going to the Moon - We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on the much bigger things we are doing, including Mars (of which the Moon is a part), Defense and Science!\u201d A day after Joe Biden affirmed his support for the Hyde amendment \u2013 a measure that prohibits the use of federal funding for abortions \u2013 the former vice president reversed course and announced that he could no longer support the ban. Growth in the US employment market decelerated sharply in May, as the economy added just 75,000 jobs \u2013 holding the unemployment rate steady at 3.6%, matching its lowest level since 1969. Trump boasted about having \u201cautomatic chemistry\u201d with the Queen during his state visit to the UK. Gun violence organizations led by black and brown activists used National Gun Violence Awareness Day to put focus on the daily toll of violence. Trump\u2019s golf course in Ireland posted a tweet promoting the president\u2019s stay there, an apparent violation of the Trump Organization\u2019s promise not to reference Trump\u2019s role as president. A US judge ruled that the FBI must release some of the redacted sections of memos written by James Comey about his conversations with the president. The Texas governor signed a law banning cities and counties from doing business with Planned Parenthood. US officials are planning to open three emergency shelters this month to house 3,000 to 4,000 unaccompanied migrant children who have crossed the border. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, has also confirmed the deal to avoid tariffs in a tweet, saying officials would soon announce details of the arrangement: The Mexican foreign minister has confirmed Trump\u2019s tweets saying the US has reached a deal with Mexico to avoid tariffs, after twelve hours at the state department: For background on the events leading up to the agreement, some details from an AP report earlier today: Companies are rushing to ship as many goods as possible out of Mexico to get ahead of the tariffs threatened by President Donald Trump, hurriedly sending cars, appliances and construction materials across the border to beat Monday\u2019s deadline. Mexican-made tiles are piled up on the pavement next to a warehouse in New Mexico. A furniture factory and a jalapeno exporter are fretting about a huge financial hit next week. And hundreds of semi-trailers carrying medical devices, televisions and Toyota pickups idled in line Friday at the truck crossing in Tijuana. Even before the tariff threat, Tijuana shipped $80 million worth of goods across the border every day. Now companies are spending millions to hire freight carriers and secure warehouse space in the U.S. in a massive shift of inventory happening over a matter of days along the nearly 2,000-mile (3,200 kilometer) border. Trump has just now tweeted that the US has signed an agreement with Mexico to avoid the tariffs he was threatening to impose: I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended. Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to.... ....stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you! The Texas governor has signed a law banning cities and counties from doing business with Planned Parenthood and any affiliate of an abortion provider, according to local reports: The law is scheduled to into effect on 1 September: US officials are planning to open three emergency shelters this month to house 3,000 to 4,000 unaccompanied migrant children who have crossed the border, according to the Washington Post. The shelters will be located on two US military bases and at a south Texas facility, officials told the Post. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will shelter 2,000 children at the military facilities and 1,600 at a temporary emergency influx shelter in Carrizo Springs, Texas, according to the report. A private contractor is expected to run the Texas facility, and HHS will run the military shelters. The news follows reports that the Trump administration is canceling English classes, legal aid and recreational programs for unaccompanied minors staying in shelters. More details on the new facilities here: An important update from the Texas Tribune today: There are now more than 5,800 migrant children held in the state. The 5,800 unaccompanied migrant children are now living in 35 shelters across Texas, according to the publication. Trump\u2019s golf vacations have now cost taxpayers nearly $106m in the last two and a half years, according to a new HuffPost report: The figure jumped this week following Trump\u2019s $3.6m detour to his golf course in Ireland. The visit sparked controversy earlier in the day after his golf course in Doonbeg promoted the president\u2019s stay in a tweet, which appeared to be a violation of the Trump Organization\u2019s promise not to reference Trump\u2019s position as president in social media posts. The club later deleted the tweet. Here\u2019s a thread worth reading from Justin Amash, the only Republican in Congress to call for the impeachment of Donald Trump: Amash said he \u201cinitially fell for Attorney General Barr\u2019s March 24 letter of principal conclusions\u201d until he read Mueller\u2019s report. Some more from his tweets: Mueller\u2019s report describes acts of obstruction by President Trump, and it clearly says Mueller chose not to decide whether Trump had committed a crime because Mueller was prohibited from actually charging him... It\u2019s not that Mueller couldn\u2019t make up his mind, chose not to make a decision, and then said Trump wasn\u2019t exonerated; rather, Mueller had decided that it was inappropriate to make a determination as to whether Trump had committed a crime, and he sought to make that fact clearer... When Barr\u2019s letter came out, the White House abruptly changed its tone. Trump said \u201cthe Mueller report was great\u201d and that Mueller had acted honorably, and he touted the report as a \u201ctotal exoneration.\u201d Kellyanne Conway referred to the investigation as \u201cthe gold standard.\u201d But, as we later found out, Mueller\u2019s report is damning for the president. If Barr\u2019s letter had accurately reflected the report, the White House would not have reacted positively. Trump said \u201cwe\u2019re doing all right\u201d when asked now about his talks with Mexico regarding his tariffs threat, according to the latest White House pool report: Read background on the tariff threat here. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg warned today that that the US Supreme Court is likely to be very divided in some of the \u201cmost watched\u201d cases that remain in the coming weeks, CNN reports: From her remarks to the Second Circuit Judicial Conference in New York: As of today, we have announced 43 decisions in argued cases. That leaves a large number (27) to be announced in the remaining June days. Of the 43 argued cases resolved so far, only 11, or just over 25%, were decided by a vote of 5 to 4 or 5 to 3. Given the number of most watched cases still unannounced, I cannot predict that the relatively low sharp divisions ratio will hold. A US judge has ruled that the FBI must release some of the redacted sections of memos written by James Comey about his conversations with the president, reports Zoe Tillman: The former FBI director carefully described each of his interactions with the president starting in January 2017 in memos that he shared with deputies and lawyers within the agency. The redacted sections relate to Trump and Comey conversations about Michael Flynn the president\u2019s former national security advisor who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and discussions about foreign leaders, according to the ruling. Some breaking media industry news: Vox Media\u2019s union has announced that it has reached a tentative agreement with the company after \u201c29 straight hours\u201d of negotiations. The union had staged a walkout yesterday, saying it was demanding stronger agreements on wage scales, severance pay and limits on subcontracting. Vox Media includes Vox.com, SB Nation, Eater, the Verge, Curbed, Polygon and other news sites. The University of Alabama has returned a philanthropist\u2019s $26.5m donation after he called on students to boycott the institution due to the state\u2019s new abortion ban. The university also took Hugh F Culverhouse Jr\u2019s name off the law school today, one week after he advocated the boycott: Culverhouse\u2019s contribution, announced in September, was the biggest ever made to the university, the AP reported. Last week, he had called for the boycott, saying: I don\u2019t want anybody to go to that law school, especially women, until the state gets its act together. University officials have denied that the decision to return the donation had anything to do with Culverhouse\u2019s comments on the abortion law and said it was prompted by a dispute over his requests for how his contribution should be spent, according to the AP. A US appeals court has lifted a judge\u2019s injunction that blocked construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to the US. Last year, a federal judge ordered a temporary halt to the controversial project, ruling that the Trump administration hadn\u2019t properly considered environmental consequences before moving forward with the massive oil project. From the AP: The ruling was a victory for TC Energy, a Calgary, Alberta-based company that wants to build the line, though company officials have said it already missed the 2019 construction season because of court delays. \u201cWe are pleased with the ruling,\u201d TC Energy spokesman Matthew John said. \u201cWe look forward to advancing the project.\u201d He did not respond to questions on whether the ruling would change the construction schedule. Days after his inauguration in 2017, Trump outraged Native American groups and environmentalists when he signed executive orders to allow construction of the Dakota Access and Keystone XL oil pipelines. The Obama administration had blocked the projects. Environmental groups have vowed to continue fighting the project: More fallout for Linda Fairstein, the former New York prosecutor who oversaw the wrongful convictions of the Central Park Five teens for the rape and beating of a jogger in 1989: Farstein, a best-selling crime novelist, has been dropped by her publisher, the AP reports. The author has been facing widespread scrutiny and backlash over the last week following the release of When They See Us, Ava DuVernay\u2019s devastating fact-based drama series on the Central Park Five. From the AP: On Friday, Dutton spokeswoman Amanda Walker confirmed a statement that the publisher\u2019s customer service line has been giving to inquiring callers, saying that it had \u201cterminated its relationship\u201d with the bestselling crime novelist. The publicist declined further comment... Fairstein had already resigned from at least two not-for-profit boards as backlash intensified and a #CancelLindaFairstein movement spread on social media. Last year, the Mystery Writers of America took the rare step of withdrawing a lifetime achievement after other authors protested, citing Fairstein\u2019s role in the Central Park case. Trump is referenced in DuVernay\u2019s series, which includes clips of his television interviews in the aftermath of the rape. Trump infamously took out ads in all of the major New York daily newspapers calling for the five boys to be executed. Fairstein was reportedly an inspiration for the popular Law and Order: Special Victims Unit TV show. Hello - Sam Levin here in the San Francisco office, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. The White House \u201cinterfered directly and aggressively\u201d with the House oversight committee\u2019s interview of Kris Kobach, the former Kansas secretary of state, according to a new memo from the committee\u2019s chairman. Kobach, the Trump ally known for pushing anti-immigrant policies, was facing questions about his role in the controversial effort to add a citizenship question to the 2020 US census: The committee alleged: The White House intervened repeatedly to block Kobach from answering the Committee\u2019s questions about his meetings with President Trump and other top White House officials, sending multiple letters purporting to assert Executive Privilege over Kobach, who was not an employee of the Executive Branch. More on the census controversy here: Rep. Jerry Nadler has been endorsed for re-election by the abortion rights group NARAL. The prominent Judiciary Committee chairman may seem like a shoo-in in his liberal New York district, but as the New York Daily News reports, the endorsement is significant because he\u2019s been taking heat from some on the left who wanted him to go harder against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Those activists pushed him to use his committee\u2019s authority to seek records of anything written by Kavanaugh related to Roe v Wade, which they hoped could force him to recuse himself from related rulings. Three women candidates have declared primary challenges against Nadler. \u201cWith reproductive freedom under attack across the country, we need proven champions like Congressman Nadler to keep standing up for us in Congress,\u201d said NARAL Pro-Choice America political director Nicole Brener-Schmitz. \u201cDonald Trump and his anti-choice Republican allies have launched a full-blown assault on reproductive freedom. They are stacking the courts with anti-choice judges and pushing a wave of extreme bans on abortion in states aimed at gutting Roe v. Wade, and eroding the rights of women and families at every turn possible. NARAL stands with Congressman Nadler as he works to fight back against these attacks on our fundamental rights and we are proud to endorse his re-election to Congress.\u201d More than a year after a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, that left 17 people dead, we\u2019re still talking about the Parkland student activists and their fight for gun control. But the student activism inspired by daily gun violence has also made waves across the country. In Washington, DC, where even Democratic members of Congress pay little attention to the daily gun violence crisis playing out in the nation\u2019s capital, one teenager organized the creation of a mural to honor her boyfriend, who was shot to death in a robbery, as well as the other teens killed last year. More on Lauryn Renford\u2019s Washington, DC mural project here, from the Washington Post last year. And here\u2019s Lauryn speaking recently about her project: The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt - reporting from Earth (of which New York is a part) - called NASA to ask whether the moon is a part of Mars, as Donald Trump asserted today. They did not immediately respond. The Trump administration is rejecting requests from US embassies around the world to fly the rainbow pride flag on their flagpoles during LGBT pride month, NBC News reports. Embassies in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Latvia have all requested permission to display the flag in June and were shot down. The Obama administration routinely allowed embassies to put the flag on their flagpoles during pride month. The denial in Germany is particularly notable because the ambassador there, Richard Grenell, is heading the Trump administration\u2019s global push to get countries to decriminalize homosexuality and is the highest ranking openly gay person in the administration. \u201cThe President\u2019s recognition of Pride Month and his tweet encouraging our decriminalization campaign gives me even more pride to once again march in the Berlin Pride parade, hang a huge banner on the side of the Embassy recognizing our pride, host multiple events at the Embassy and the residence, and fly the gay pride flag,\u201d Grenell told NBC. Joe Biden adviser Symone Sanders and actor Alyssa Milano were among those pushing him to change his position on the Hyde Amendment, the Atlantic reports. Biden, who had long supported the prohibition on federal money being used for abortion, reversed himself Thursday night and opposed it. Today is National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Democratic members of Congress have been marking another milestone on the calendar: more than 100 days since the Democrats used their new House majority to pass a landmark bill to expand background checks on gun sales. They are once again pressuring the Republican-controlled house to take up the legislation to require background checks on all gun sales, which polls have repeatedly shown that the vast majority of Americans support. Lawmakers introduced amendments Friday to block a $4,500 pay increase for members of Congress, the Hill reported. A spending package pending in Congress would allow the cost of living increase to take effect at the beginning of next year. Since 2010, language has been inserted to block the lawmakers\u2019 raise. A number of freshman lawmakers joined the effort to keep the pay freeze in place. Media Matters identifies a possible trigger for Donald Trump\u2019s seemingly out of nowhere tweet about the moon. Fox Business Network host Neil Cavuto had discussed NASA\u2019s plans for a 2024 moon trip shortly beforehand. We\u2019re still not sure about Trump\u2019s assertion that the moon is part of Mars, but he could be referring to how returning to the moon is seen by NASA as part of a plan to eventually get to Mars. If that\u2019s the case, maybe he\u2019s not against going to the moon after all? Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who have called for a tougher approach to big tech companies, have each attracted large amounts of contributions from people connected to Google and other tech companies, the Wall Street Journal reports. For Warren, who has called for breaking up big tech companies, employees at Google and its parent company have made up the largest source of higher-dollar donations. Sanders and Warren each received roughly $30,000 in higher-dollar donations from people affiliated with Google, its parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon. Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee says the best way to honor gun violence victims is to \u201cresolutely fight back against the @NRA at every turn.\u201d Donald Trump does not want NASA going to the moon. He also says the moon is a part of Mars. We\u2019re not sure what he means by that one. House Democrats are calling on the Senate to pass two gun bills, which would require universal background checks to buy a gun and extend the time for background checks to ten days from three. The legislation has already passed the House. Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda has also weighed in on gun violence awareness day. Donald Trump says \u201cthere is a good chance\u201d the US and Mexico will reach a deal to avert tariffs by Monday. FEMA auditors were directed to produce \u201cfeel-good reports\u201d that left out the serious problems in the agency\u2019s emergency response, the Washington Post reports. An internal review and interviews with the paper showed that the audits gave an inaccurate picture of FEMA\u2019s handling of flooding in Louisiana in 2016 and other disaster responses. Former Homeland Security secretary John Kelly, who later became White House chief of staff, was identified as responsible for the distortions. Donald Trump claimed in his Fox News interview aired last night that the head of NATO said, \u201cWithout Donald Trump, maybe there would be no NATO.\u201d The quote is completely made up, the Washington Post reports. There is no record of NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who Trump called \u201cmaybe Trump\u2019s biggest fan,\u201d saying any such thing. Donald Trump\u2019s Ireland golf club has now deleted tweets promoting the president\u2019s stay there, per the Washington Post. Donald Trump is railing against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for her comment to fellow Democrats that he should be \u201cin prison\u201d instead of getting impeached. He called her a \u201ca disgrace to herself and her family.\u201d Gun violence organizations led by black and brown activists are using National Gun Violence Awareness Day to put focus on the daily toll of violence, and the need to fight for strategies that help prevent community violence, not just mass shootings: It\u2019s a tough task running for president while also running the nation\u2019s biggest city. The latest example for Mayor Bill de Blasio: He\u2019s taking heat for skipping Sunday\u2019s Puerto Rican Day parade, when he will instead be campaigning in Iowa. He defended the decision on Friday, the New York Post reports. \u201cWhen you\u2019re running for president of United States this is always a challenge, to balance the schedules,\u201d he said on WNYC radio. \u201cWhat\u2019s happening Sunday is one of the biggest Democratic party events of the year in Iowa.\u201d \u201cMy respect, my commitment, to the Puerto Rican community is very, very well known in the community, and it will continue deeply,\u201d de Blasio added. The Iraqi journalist best known for throwing his shoes at former President George W Bush has endorsed Mike Gravel for president. The former Alaska senator and longshot 2020 candidate announced the endorsement Friday from Muntadher al-Zaidi. He threw his shoes at Bush in 2008 in a show of dissatisfaction with the Iraq war, making him a cult hero in much of the Arab world, and was sentenced to three years in prison. Gravel\u2019s campaign said that al-Zaidi expressed his wishes \u201cfor your success in the elections\u201d and asked that his endorsement be announced via press release after learning about Gravel\u2019s platform of withdrawing US troops from foreign theaters. Alabama voters are divided on a new law to criminalize nearly all abortions in the state, according to a new poll. The poll found that 33% approve of the law signed by governor Kay Ivey that would threaten doctors with up to 99 years in prison for performing an abortion, and 38% disapprove. Among those, an evenly matched 23% strongly approve and strongly disapprove of the governor signing the bill. A substantial 29% are undecided. The poll was jointly conducted by Democrat-aligned Bold Blue Campaigns and GOP-aligned JMC Analytics and Polling. It found that 14% of voters say they support prohibiting abortion without exceptions, 13% say it should be prohibited with exceptions for rape and incest (which the legislation does not have), 15% say it should be legal up until a certain point at pregnancy, and 10% say it should be legal at any point. Another 48% are undecided. The White House is moving forward with Donald Trump\u2019s plan to have Air Force One painted red, white, and blue, Bloomberg News reports. Trump broached the idea last year, asking that new Air Force One jets, made by Boeing, be painted in the colors of the American flag, replacing the blue and white design used since the 1960s. The White House is now \u201cevaluating specific red, white, and blue livery (paint scheme) options,\u201d the Air Force told Bloomberg in a statement. Virginia\u2019s governor has set a July 9 start date for a special legislative session on gun-related legislation after last week\u2019s deadly shooting rampage in Virginia Beach. Gov. Ralph Northam announced the date Friday, the Associated Press reports: The Democratic governor says the best way to respond to the May 31 mass shooting at a municipal building is with \u201cvotes and laws, not thoughts and prayers.\u201d He wants the Republican-led General Assembly to consider gun-control measures including universal background checks and a ban on silencers. Police say the gunman who fatally shot 12 people used a silencer. Northam can call the session but can\u2019t dictate how it\u2019s conducted. Republican leaders have given little indication they plan to follow his agenda. Instead, they\u2019ve said they\u2019ll propose tougher penalties for those who use guns to commit crimes. Beto O\u2019Rourke, in a video from the Atlanta airport, says the US will continue to lose 100 lives a day to gun violence \u201cuntil we adopt universal background checks, close all loopholes, stop selling weapons of war into our communities - leave those on the battlefield - and until we enact red flag laws everywhere so that anyone who is a danger to themselves or someone else is stopped before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Donald Trump may decide over the weekend to delay his planned tariffs on Mexico, a White House official said. Marc Short, chief of staff to the vice-president, Mike Pence, said the tariffs may be delayed if negotiations between the US and Mexico go well, the Washington Post reported. \u201cThere\u2019s a long way to go still, that\u2019s the bottom line,\u201d he said, according to the Post. \u201cBut I think that there is the ability, if negotiations continue to go well, that the president can turn that off at some point over the weekend.\u201d Trump has said a 5% tariff on Mexican goods will go into effect Monday, and could increase to 25% over time, because of his displeasure with immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border. US and Mexican officials have been in negotiations, discussing a plan that could keep Central American asylum seekers out of the US and allow the government to quickly deport those who do make it in. Rep. Eric Swalwell has released the first ad of his presidential campaign, targeting gun violence. The ad began running Friday in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and other states, the Hill reported. Launched on gun violence awareness day, it makes Swalwell one of the first Democrats running TV ads, before several better known rivals. The ad shows clips of protests and vigils for gun violence victims, according to the Hill. \u201cI say keep your hunting rifles, keep your pistols, keep your shotguns, but let\u2019s ban and buy back every single assault weapon in America,\u201d Swalwell says in the ad. Vice President Mike Pence turns 60 today. Indiana farmers battered by tornadoes and storms are also bracing for the effects of Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, the Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe reports. Trump has threatened tariffs on Mexico, a major buyer of Indiana corn. He says there will be a 5% levy on Mexican imports starting next week and has said the fees could rise to 25% unless Mexico does more to stem the flow of migrants. Already, exports of soybeans to China have all but dried up thanks to the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing trade dispute with Beijing. Puerto Rican grounds are concerned about the lack of attention to the island\u2019s plight after Hurrican Maria from presidential candidates. Senator Elizabeth Warren and former housing secretary Julian Castro are the only candidates to have visited Puerto Rico so far, CBS News reports. Warren has released a plan to restructure Puerto Rico\u2019s debt. But several campaigns - those of Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, and Pete Buttigieg - did not respond to requests by CBS News to elaborate on their platforms for Puerto Rico and reveal whether the candidates are planning to visit the island during the campaign. Former President Barack Obama says \u201cwe can\u2019t get numb\u201d to the families and communities \u201cshattered by senseless gun violence.\u201d Presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg and husband Chasten\u2019s dogs get in on the act with orange bandanas marking gun violence awareness day. Senator Elizabeth Warren calls for ending \u201cthe NRA\u2019s death grip on our federal government.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Doonbeg, Ireland posted a tweet promoting the president\u2019s stay there, in an apparent violation of the Trump Organization\u2019s promise not to reference Trump\u2019s role as president of the United States. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said tariffs on Mexican goods are still scheduled to take effect Monday. \u201cOur position hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she told reporters aboard Air Force One, according to a pool report. \u201cTariffs are going to take effect on Monday.\u201d US and Mexican officials have been discussing a potential deal that would require Central American migrants to apply for asylum in countries other than the United States, and send troops to Mexico\u2019s southern border. \u201cThey\u2019ve made a lot of progress,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThe meetings have gone well but as of now we\u2019re still on track for tariffs on Monday.\u201d Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords marks gun violence awareness day. Alec Baldwin says he is \u201cso done\u201d with playing Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live. Baldwin told USA Today he\u2019d be fine with the job going to Trump impersonator Anthony Atamanuik. \u201cHe can have it. I\u2019ve done that. I mean, I had a lot of fun...and when Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider wrote (Trump sketches in 2016 and 2017), that was new, it was fresh and the ratings were good,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m done with that now. I\u2019m so done with that.\u201d Baldwin said he \u201ccan\u2019t imagine\u201d he would return to SNL next season. House Democrats may open a probe into Rudy Giuliani for his overseas political and security consulting work. The Daily Beast reports that top members are actively discussing a possible investigation of the Donald Trump lawyer and former New York mayor. The investigation would likely look at whether Giuliani\u2019s relationships with foreign politicos interfered or intersected with American foreign policy efforts, the Daily Beast reported. Of particular interest is his trip to Ukraine to push for an inquiry into Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter\u2019s involvement in a Ukrainian gas company. \u201cIf they want to come after me, I gladly accept it, because we could just make the Biden stuff bigger news,\u201d Giuliani told The Daily Beast. \u201cDo it! Give me a chance to give a couple speeches about it and hold a press conference. I\u2019d love that.\u201d Billionaire Charles Koch\u2019s conservative political network is launching four new PACs, CNN reports. The groups will back incumbents in primaries who have sided with Koch\u2019s positions on trade, immigration and other issues. His organization, Americans for Prosperity, is working to distance itself from Donald Trump and his wing of the Republican party, CNN reports. There will be four separate PACs devoted to trade, immigration, free speech issues and \u201ceconomic opportunity,\u201d and they will be open to backing politicians from either party allied with their libertarian-leaning positions. Of course, many Democrats may not find it helpful to get backing from the well-known billionaire. More than three quarters of Americans support upholding the Roe v Wade decision legalizing abortion, according to a new poll. In the NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll, a total of 77% of Americans said they support keeping the landmark decision in place in some form, while 13% want it overturned. Americans are split, however, on how many restrictions there should be on abortion access: 26% say they want to keep Roe but add more restrictions, 21% want to expand it to allow abortion in any circumstance, 16% want to keep it in its current form, and 14% want to keep it while removing some abortion restrictions. Several states have passed bans on abortion with the aim of getting to the Supreme Court and getting Roe v Wade overturned. Family members of people killed by guns explain why they are pushing for action: Filmmaker Spike Lee called for Hollywood production companies to pull out of Georgia over its law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. The Associated Press reports: Most studios that have commented have said they\u2019re waiting to see if the so-called \u201cheartbeat\u201d law actually takes effect next year, or if the courts will block it. But at the arrivals line for Denzel Washington\u2019s AFI Lifetime Achievement tribute Thursday, Lee said now is the time for Georgia-based productions to \u201cshut it down\u201d and boycott the state\u2019s booming film industry to drive change. Lee acknowledged that a mass exodus could dent livelihoods, but cited black bus drivers affected by the Civil Rights Movement-era boycott in Montgomery. Georgia\u2019s economy currently gets a $9.5 billion annual boost from the industry. Presidential rival Seth Moulton offered some backhanded praise after former Vice President Joe Biden reversed himself last night and opposed the ban on using federal money for abortions, known as the Hyde amendment. \u201cNow do the Iraq War,\u201d tweeted Moulton, a Massachusetts congressman. Rep. Eric Swalwell is running a presidential campaign specifically targeted at ending America\u2019s epidemic of gun violence, as the Guardian\u2019s Richard Luscombe reports today. He launched his campaign two months ago near Parkland, Florida, alongside survivors and families of victims of the high school mass shooting there. \u201cWe\u2019re on this carousel where loss, grief, anger and then thoughts and prayers from Washington is an alibi for doing nothing,\u201d Swalwell told the Guardian. He has several proposals to tackle the guns crisis and remove military-style assault weapons from the streets of the US, including a controversial buy-back program that goes further than any of his rivals vying for the Democratic presidential nomination for 2020. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it has to be the new normal,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the lives lost but the trauma and anxiety that every kid in America is going through right now, that you can\u2019t quantify so easily, but will have lasting effects on their lives because of gun violence in our schools. Today, activists across the United States will be marking National Gun Violence Awareness Day, and wearing orange as a symbolic call for safety and an end to shootings. Wearing Orange Day started as a tribute to Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old from Chicago who was shot to death in 2013, just a week after performing at Barack Obama\u2019s second inaguration. The murder of Hadiya, a charismatic honor student was one of the few Chicago shootings to get national attention. Michelle Obama attended her funeral. But it was Hadiya\u2019s high school friends, including Nza-Ari Khepra, who began organizing locally to break the cycle of violence, including trying to address structural inequities in Chicago and asking people to wear orange -- the color of hunter safety -- for gun violence prevention. By 2015, national gun control organizations, including Everytown for Gun Safety, had picked up on the campaign and worked to make it national, with celebrities and athletes wearing orange for gun violence prevention activism, and sharing photos under the hashtag #wearingorange. National Gun Violence Awareness day falls near Hadiya Pendleton\u2019s birthday, June 2. She would have been 22 this year. In past years, her parents have had crowds of protesters at rallies for gun control and violence prevention pause their political speeches, and sing their daughter Happy Birthday.",
