In 1969, at the age of 21, he cast his first vote for Gough Whitlam, and was a member of the party during the reforming Hawke-Keating governments of the 1980s and 90s. After almost a decade of \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d defeats in the New South Wales and federal elections, he was feeling \u201cinvigorated\u201d on Friday afternoon after attending Bob Hawke\u2019s memorial service at Sydney\u2019s Opera House. \u201cBut it made me sad because I think \u2013 if only we had half the quality of that cabinet in the Hawke and Keating governments,\u201d he said. \u201cIf only we could get a leader like Bob Hawke, or Neville Wran for that matter. But they don\u2019t come along every day. You don\u2019t go down to the shop and buy a leader like that, it\u2019s something that just happens.\u201d A Labor member for more than 50 years, Sheils, from Dolls Point in Sydney\u2019s south, is supporting his local MP Chris Minns against the Strathfield MP Jodi McKay in the NSW Labor leadership contest. Delayed after Michael Daley\u2019s defeat to Gladys Berejiklian in March because of the federal election, the contest has been slowly bubbling away since the end of May. Minns, 39, is campaigning on a platform of generational change after two consecutive defeats in NSW and has said he will end Sydney\u2019s lockout laws, introduce pill testing at music festivals and ban donations from the fossil fuel industry. A former assistant secretary of the NSW Labor party, he entered parliament as the MP for Kogarah at the 2015 election and has served as the shadow minister for water since 2016. His opponent, McKay, 49, is a former Newcastle MP, who served as a junior minister in the Rees and Keneally governments before losing at the landslide 2011 election that swept Labor from power after 16 years in government. She returned to parliament in 2015 as the MP for Strathfield after an Independent Commission Against Corruption inquiry into illegal donations, which revealed she had been the victim of a campaign \u2013 orchestrated by Labor\u2019s right-wing faction boss Joe Tripodi and Newcastle businessman Nathan Tinkler to defeat her. The inquiry also found that McKay had rejected an attempt by Tinkler to offer her illegal donations, leading the former Labor leader Luke Foley to describe her as \u201cincorruptible\u201d. McKay, who is now the opposition spokeswoman for transport, is using that reputation to put restoring trust in the Labor brand at the centre of her pitch. Backed by the party\u2019s head office and most of the current frontbench, she says she\u2019ll use her upbringing in Gloucester in the Hunter Valley to reconnect the party with regional voters. While the Labor head office has backed her, the right\u2019s loyalties are split and the left has not fallen in behind either candidate, which means how the caucus vote will shape out remains unclear. It is also the first time NSW has given the party rank and file a 50% say in who the new state leader will be, adding an element of uncertainty to the mix. In the Hunter region, for example, while most of the region\u2019s MPs have publicly backed McKay, some senior figures in the party\u2019s branches, including former Newcastle federal MP Sharon Grierson, are supporting Minns, at least in part, because of a more-than decade-old grudge relating to McKay\u2019s preselection over the then sitting MP in Newcastle, Bryce Gaudry, in 2006. Further north towards the coal mining areas around the Hunter Valley, the support among members is more clearly defined for McKay. Spooked by the high One Nation vote in the seats of Paterson and Hunter at the federal election, many members there see McKay as better able to win back traditional working class voters because of her ties to the area. John Leao, 18, from the Maitland branch of the ALP, said he was voting for McKay because \u201cshe\u2019s a local\u201d. \u201cShe grew up in Gloucester and spent many years here as a local journalist so she\u2019s in touch with the needs in our region \u2013 for example issues with youth unemployment and amongst Novocastrians in general,\u201d he said. The policy tussle has failed to set things alight so far and there remains an air of awkwardness about two right-faction MPs trying to differentiate themselves to the party\u2019s 17,000 members. At a debate at the Teacher\u2019s Federation in Sydney on Wednesday night, McKay and Minns often seemed to be trying hard to find ways to appear to disagree. Consider this back-and-forth on the 2.5% wages cap on the NSW public service introduced by the Liberal government in 2011, which Labor opposes: Minns: \u201cOne thing that\u2019s really hampered wage growth in this state in particular has been the wages cap on public servants.

It\u2019s hurting productivity in NSW.\u201d McKay: \u201cI said it has to go.\u201d If exchanges like that don\u2019t exactly suggest a cavernous policy difference between the candidates, rest assured that behind the scenes NSW Labor is not giving up on its reputation as a home for political blood sport. Minns was the target of an invoice leaked to the ABC last week, which showed that in 2013 he received $5,000 of a $100,000 donation from a Chinese businessman to federal frontbencher Chris Bowen. The money was to help Minns move back from the US to run Bowen\u2019s campaign for re-election that year. A document circulated internally among Labor members recently described long-term members of the NSW right as believing Minns\u2019 leadership would be \u201ccatastrophic\u201d for the party. Many of the current frontbench are privately scathing, too. Minns is often described as a party apparatchik because of his time in the Labor head office, and his opponents describe him as overly ambitious and lacking in team spirit. The Port Stephens MP and shadow minister for childcare, Kate Washington, told Guardian Australia she was supporting McKay because she was a \u201chardworking team player with integrity\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to me and our membership, that we have a leader who\u2019s focused on the needs of communities right across NSW, especially outside of Sydney,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve known Jodi for years, and I know she truly understands rural and regional NSW. \u201cWe need someone who can unify our movement, rebuild trust and earn the respect of communities across NSW.

      "body": "<p>Britain will be hampered in its ability to retain influence after Brexit as core spending on diplomatic services falls to a 20-year low, ministers will be warned.</p> <p>An analysis of the Foreign Office\u2019s budget since the 1970s, published this week, finds that successive governments have presided over cuts, which have affected Britain\u2019s ability to advance its foreign policy aims.</p> <p>Since the UK joined the EU, core diplomatic spending has fallen from 0.5% of public sector current expenditure to 0.1%, according to a report by the British Foreign Policy Group. It finds that if the government continues with its projected cuts, core diplomatic funding will fall to its lowest level in 20 years.</p> <p>The report has alarmed senior MPs and will be launched by Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, and Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee. It warns that further cuts will cause irreversible damage to the UK\u2019s diplomatic capacity at a time when the country can least afford it.</p> <p>Theo Clarke, chief executive of the not-for-profit Coalition for Global Prosperity, which is also supporting the findings, said: \u201cAn effective development budget, alongside an active diplomatic and defence strategy, keeps Britain at the forefront of bringing freedom, security and prosperity to those who need it most.</p> <p>\u201cAs we leave the EU, we must reaffirm our commitment to engaging with the international community and building prosperity across the globe.\u201d</p> <p>It comes after the foreign affairs select committee concluded last year that the Foreign Office was facing an \u201cunsustainable\u201d lack of funding and that British diplomats needed a pay rise.

      "bodyText": "Britain will be hampered in its ability to retain influence after Brexit as core spending on diplomatic services falls to a 20-year low, ministers will be warned. An analysis of the Foreign Office\u2019s budget since the 1970s, published this week, finds that successive governments have presided over cuts, which have affected Britain\u2019s ability to advance its foreign policy aims. Since the UK joined the EU, core diplomatic spending has fallen from 0.5% of public sector current expenditure to 0.1%, according to a report by the British Foreign Policy Group. It finds that if the government continues with its projected cuts, core diplomatic funding will fall to its lowest level in 20 years. The report has alarmed senior MPs and will be launched by Tom Tugendhat, the Tory chair of the foreign affairs select committee, and Hilary Benn, the Labour chair of the Brexit select committee. It warns that further cuts will cause irreversible damage to the UK\u2019s diplomatic capacity at a time when the country can least afford it. Theo Clarke, chief executive of the not-for-profit Coalition for Global Prosperity, which is also supporting the findings, said: \u201cAn effective development budget, alongside an active diplomatic and defence strategy, keeps Britain at the forefront of bringing freedom, security and prosperity to those who need it most. \u201cAs we leave the EU, we must reaffirm our commitment to engaging with the international community and building prosperity across the globe.\u201d It comes after the foreign affairs select committee concluded last year that the Foreign Office was facing an \u201cunsustainable\u201d lack of funding and that British diplomats needed a pay rise. Its report found that the Foreign Office has the lowest median pay of any government department for policy officers and middle management officers. Last year, the foreign office sold its embassy in Bangkok to fund modernisation projects across its global estate. The sale represented the largest land deal in Thai history and the Foreign Office\u2019s biggest ever sale. The department said the proceeds, equivalent to a third of its core annual budget of \u00a31.2bn, would pay for 30-40 modernisation projects around the world.",

On the television news that night, a stern-faced presenter announced: \u201cSo quite literally by scoring this goal, Maradona made a big mess.\u201d A year and a half later, Napoli were champions of Italy, their first <em>scudetto</em> in a long, underwhelming history. The party went on for two months. Hundreds of newborn boys were named Diego, the girls Diega.</p> <p>These are details from the riveting, immersive new documentary <em>Diego Maradona</em>, made by Asif Kapadia, whose previous films have traced the extraordinary lives and premature demises of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/05/ayrton-senna-alain-prost\" title=\"\">Ayrton Senna</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a>. Much of <em>Diego Maradona </em>is preoccupied with the crazy tale of how the best player in the world ended up at one of Italy\u2019s least desirable clubs and what happened next. The fact that the Argentinian, within three seasons, almost single-footedly took Napoli from perennial relegation-dodgers to the summit of the best and toughest league in the world is often used by his admirers to explain why he should be regarded as the greatest player ever to step on a football pitch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/07/maradona-naples-documentary\">Maradona and Naples created an unearthly and sometimes dark magic.

      "bodyText": "When Napoli beat Juventus 1-0 in November 1985, thanks to a Diego Maradona free-kick, five people fainted in the stadium and two had heart attacks. On the television news that night, a stern-faced presenter announced: \u201cSo quite literally by scoring this goal, Maradona made a big mess.\u201d A year and a half later, Napoli were champions of Italy, their first scudetto in a long, underwhelming history. The party went on for two months. Hundreds of newborn boys were named Diego, the girls Diega. These are details from the riveting, immersive new documentary Diego Maradona, made by Asif Kapadia, whose previous films have traced the extraordinary lives and premature demises of Ayrton Senna and Amy Winehouse. Much of Diego Maradona is preoccupied with the crazy tale of how the best player in the world ended up at one of Italy\u2019s least desirable clubs and what happened next. The fact that the Argentinian, within three seasons, almost single-footedly took Napoli from perennial relegation-dodgers to the summit of the best and toughest league in the world is often used by his admirers to explain why he should be regarded as the greatest player ever to step on a football pitch. I was in Naples last month and it\u2019s easy to find people who remember the first title \u2013 in 1986-87 \u2013 as if it was five minutes ago. Gennaro Montuori, an ultra who directed 20,000 fans in Curva B at Napoli\u2019s Stadio San Paolo, was one. Now in his early 60s, he pulled out his hearing aid to show me what happens when you stand in front of 50 drummers every fortnight for decades (Maradona apparently paid for some of the drums, so the atmosphere would be especially intense). Asked what that first title felt like, Montuori said: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to explain.

The One That Got Away. This doesn\u2019t feature much in Kapadia\u2019s film, perhaps because Maradona\u2019s life was enough of a soap opera without it. But it was a year that still perplexed Neapolitans, niggled at them more than 30 years on. And hearing them talk about it, it was not hard to understand why it rankled. The champions started the next season in ruthless form. Maradona had been joined by the Brazilian striker Careca, one of the stars of the 1986 World Cup. Together with the Italian Bruno Giordano, they became known as \u201cMa-Gi-Ca\u201d, the most feared frontline in Serie A. Milan, meanwhile, seemed to be in transition.

In their last five matches, they drew one and lost four, including a dramatic showdown against Milan at home that ended in a 3-2 defeat. Winning the scudetto had inspired the biggest party in the history of Naples. Now, one year later, there was almost a wake. Of course, dramatic collapses happen all the time in sport. Think of Greg Norman at the 1996 Masters or Jean van de Velde \u2013 three strokes ahead on the final hole \u2013 at the 1999 Open. There\u2019s Newcastle United, 12 points clear in mid-January in 1995-96, or even Barcelona losing the plot against Liverpool last month. Pressure builds, nerves crack; it\u2019s one of the main reasons we all tune in and keep watching even when a result seems determined. But Napoli\u2019s choke in 1987-88 has always been wrapped up in deep folds of suspicion. The city has been home to the Camorra crime syndicate since the 17th century.

      "bodyText": "A gold and copper mine proposed for the Sepik region in Papua New Guinea by an Australian-based company threatens to destroy the health of a major river system, poison fish stocks and cause violent unrest, a report has found. The Chinese-owned company, PanAust, says the Frieda river project could have a 45-year life span and generate A$12.45bn in tax, royalties and production levies for the PNG government and landholders. But the report, from research centre Jubilee Australia and Project Sepik, raises serious environmental and social concerns about the mine. \u201cThe lack of information released by the company about its environmental management plans are continuing to cause uncertainty about whether the company\u2019s environmental management plans will be fit for purpose,\u201d it says. \u201cThe potential for this project to lead to damaging social conflict and unrest is real and must be taken seriously.\u201d Papua New Guinea has a chequered mining history, including an environmental disaster when the BHP Ok Tedi copper mine\u2019s tailings dam failed and the decade-long civil war on Bougainville, which was triggered by the Rio Tinto majority-owned Panguna copper mine and cost an estimated 20,000 lives. The report notes that one of the PanAust project\u2019s biggest challenges will be building a safe storage facility for the mine\u2019s tailings (waste material left over after separating the valuable mineral from the ore) to prevent acid rock drainage. That occurs when mine waste is exposed to oxygen and produces sulphuric acid, which dissolves heavy metals such as mercury from nearby rocks, which can then leach into rivers. The report says the size of the ore body, combined with the relatively low grade of copper in the deposit, means the mine will generate substantial tailings. \u201cThe inaccessibility of the terrain will pose challenges when it comes to finding a large enough site or sites for storage,\u201d it says. \u201cThe extremely high rainfall in the area and the fact that the area is a site of seismic activity add to the risks of a dam collapse. The technical complexity of the feat facing the mining engineers, the extremely large costs involved, and the weather and seismic situation all adds up to a very expensive environmental management problem and one with considerable risks.\u201d Locals also have concerns about environmental damage from an increase in the number of large vessels operating on the Freida river. PanAust promised in April it would shortly release an environmental impact statement to nearby villages, but researchers say it has not done so. In response to to questions from Guardian Australia, the company said PanAust had not received a copy of the Jubilee report and \u201cas such, the company is not in a position to comment on its contents\u201d. It did however say that PanAust had submitted its plans and an environmental impact statement to PNG regulators and was working with them on its approval. The report also accused PanAust of a flawed consultation process with indigenous communities downstream from the mine which has created an \u201catmosphere of animosity and lack of trust\u201d and resulted in acts of sabotage. \u201cThere are reports of official (mainly police) intimidation of anti-mine activists,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn 2017 a youth leader from Oum 2 village led a group of young men to attack a tugboat and pontoon with homemade wire sling shots.\u201d In October researchers visited 23 nearby villages, where locals repeatedly raised concerns about river and fish health as a result of increased sedimentation from increased tugboat traffic connected with the project. The Freida river joins the 1,126km Sepik river, which flows across the provinces of West Sepik and East Sepik provinces. The local economy is built on the sale of sago (starch from a tropical palm stem), fish, freshwater prawn, eels, turtles and crocodile eggs. Crocodiles are also harvested for their skins and teeth. Locals are worried about the mine affecting their food security, the report says. In a company announcement in December, PanAust characterised the mine project as a \u201cnation building development\u201d.

Listeria is caused by the bacterium <em>Listeria monocytogenes </em>and can trigger very severe disease in humans. It usually affects people whose immune systems have been weakened \u2013 such as the elderly, pregnant women or patients taking immuno-suppressant drugs. The disease is caught by eating contaminated food.</p> <p>The first three deaths were at Manchester University NHS foundation trust and Aintree University Hospital NHS foundation trust in Liverpool. One of the two new cases is understood to have died after these three cases. However, the other patient died before the three succumbed. Doctors have only just discovered the death was linked to the same strain of the bacterium.</p> <p>\u201cThese two cases had already been reported to Public Health England but were re-analysed using whole genome sequence data,\u201d said Dr Catherine Rees, associate professor in microbiology at Nottingham University. \u201cThis showed that the listeria isolated from these patients were highly likely to have come from the same source.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3239098f73769d9de3793cd7fd33f9a631d90257\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3239098f73769d9de3793cd7fd33f9a631d90257/473_236_3324_1995/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The trusts where the latest two victims were receiving treatment have not yet been named, although PHE said there are now seven trusts across the country dealing with listeria cases. The first case showed symptoms on 25 April and sandwiches and salads were withdrawn on 25 May. It is understood that some of the products were sold at hospitals, while others were given to patients.</p> <p>\u201cPre-packed sandwiches are recurrently incriminated in the UK in listeriosis episodes,\u201d added Professor Jose Vazquez-Boland of Edinburgh University. \u201cFor example, in 2017 there was an outbreak in Yorkshire and the Humber that also involved sandwiches supplied to hospitals. There is clearly a warning here that microbiological controls for listeria need to be stepped up with pre-packed sandwiches.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, foods involved in listeria infections are industrially processed foods that are kept at refrigeration temperatures and are consumed without previous cooking.\u201d</p> <p>The Good Food Chain, which supplied 43 NHS trusts across the UK, voluntarily ceased production. The company was supplied with meats from North Country Cooked Meat. Some of these have since tested positive for the outbreak strain of <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> and the company has also stopped production. \u201cSince the source has been traced, there should be no more exposure, but the bacterium\u2019s long incubation period means that the risk of new cases coming to light cannot be ruled out yet,\u201d added Rees.</p> <p>In a statement, The Good Food Chain said: \u201cThe underlying cause of it [the outbreak] remains unclear. We understand the investigations being carried out are complicated, but we hope the authorities will pursue their inquiries with all urgency so the wider industry can learn any lessons as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <h2>The lunchbox killer<br></h2> <p><em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> is probably the deadliest bacterial foodborne pathogen in the western world, and while it mainly affects individuals such as the elderly, pregnant women, infants, and those taking immuno-suppressant drugs, it can also affect other people. It is also one of three foodborne pathogens that put the highest burden on healthcare facilities. There are around 200 cases of listeriosis per year in England and Wales and about 30 deaths. However, that fatality rate can reach higher levels in some groups, such as pregnant women.</p> <p>Listeriosis is a problem because it is present in the environment and can easily contaminate pre-packed foods. Furthermore, in many cases it does not occur as a normal foodborne illness that is associated with diarrhoea and vomiting but as an infection of the foetus or as meningitis. Survivors can be left with permanent damage, such as brain damage.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Protection relies heavily on having a well-monitored system of food production and distribution</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Kimon Andreas Karatzas</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite the major advances in food safety, <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em> still finds its way into foods. Our protection relies heavily on having a well-monitored system of food production and distribution combined with a good centralised surveillance process that can raise the alarm when cases appear. Then the disease can be linked to specific foods. As we have seen with this outbreak, good surveillance was key to identifying cases. The food responsible (sandwiches) was pinpointed and the contaminated ingredient (meat) was identified, leading to the immediate removal of the product.</p> <p>However, the disease\u2019s long incubation period \u2013 up to 70 days \u2013 often makes it difficult to identify the guilty food product. In this outbreak, there were cases where authorities could not originally identify the source. However, once they discovered the outbreak they were able to link new cases with the outbreak.</p> <p>It is clear that, without good surveillance, authorities would have been unaware of the outbreak for a very long time. This was the case with last year\u2019s listeriosis outbreak in South Africa that had been occurring for more than a year and had killed 216 people before it was pinpointed.</p> <p>Clearly the public should not be worried this time as the contaminated products have been removed. Some cases may still appear due to the disease\u2019s long incubation period, but this should not be a cause of concern for the public. The decision to review food sold in hospitals is a sound step, nevertheless, as patients and pregnant women remain at risk.</p> <p><strong>Dr Kimon Andreas Karatzas</strong><strong>,</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Reading University</strong></p>",

It is understood that some of the products were sold at hospitals, while others were given to patients. \u201cPre-packed sandwiches are recurrently incriminated in the UK in listeriosis episodes,\u201d added Professor Jose Vazquez-Boland of Edinburgh University. \u201cFor example, in 2017 there was an outbreak in Yorkshire and the Humber that also involved sandwiches supplied to hospitals. There is clearly a warning here that microbiological controls for listeria need to be stepped up with pre-packed sandwiches. \u201cIn general, foods involved in listeria infections are industrially processed foods that are kept at refrigeration temperatures and are consumed without previous cooking.\u201d The Good Food Chain, which supplied 43 NHS trusts across the UK, voluntarily ceased production. The company was supplied with meats from North Country Cooked Meat. Some of these have since tested positive for the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes and the company has also stopped production. \u201cSince the source has been traced, there should be no more exposure, but the bacterium\u2019s long incubation period means that the risk of new cases coming to light cannot be ruled out yet,\u201d added Rees. In a statement, The Good Food Chain said: \u201cThe underlying cause of it [the outbreak] remains unclear. We understand the investigations being carried out are complicated, but we hope the authorities will pursue their inquiries with all urgency so the wider industry can learn any lessons as soon as possible.\u201d The lunchbox killer Listeria monocytogenes is probably the deadliest bacterial foodborne pathogen in the western world, and while it mainly affects individuals such as the elderly, pregnant women, infants, and those taking immuno-suppressant drugs, it can also affect other people. It is also one of three foodborne pathogens that put the highest burden on healthcare facilities. There are around 200 cases of listeriosis per year in England and Wales and about 30 deaths. However, that fatality rate can reach higher levels in some groups, such as pregnant women. Listeriosis is a problem because it is present in the environment and can easily contaminate pre-packed foods. Furthermore, in many cases it does not occur as a normal foodborne illness that is associated with diarrhoea and vomiting but as an infection of the foetus or as meningitis. Survivors can be left with permanent damage, such as brain damage. Despite the major advances in food safety, Listeria monocytogenes still finds its way into foods. Our protection relies heavily on having a well-monitored system of food production and distribution combined with a good centralised surveillance process that can raise the alarm when cases appear. Then the disease can be linked to specific foods. As we have seen with this outbreak, good surveillance was key to identifying cases. The food responsible (sandwiches) was pinpointed and the contaminated ingredient (meat) was identified, leading to the immediate removal of the product. However, the disease\u2019s long incubation period \u2013 up to 70 days \u2013 often makes it difficult to identify the guilty food product. In this outbreak, there were cases where authorities could not originally identify the source. However, once they discovered the outbreak they were able to link new cases with the outbreak. It is clear that, without good surveillance, authorities would have been unaware of the outbreak for a very long time. This was the case with last year\u2019s listeriosis outbreak in South Africa that had been occurring for more than a year and had killed 216 people before it was pinpointed. Clearly the public should not be worried this time as the contaminated products have been removed. Some cases may still appear due to the disease\u2019s long incubation period, but this should not be a cause of concern for the public. The decision to review food sold in hospitals is a sound step, nevertheless, as patients and pregnant women remain at risk. Dr Kimon Andreas Karatzas, Reading University",

Residents in at least 590 homes in Wainfleet and Thorpe Culvert were told to leave as waters continued to surge on Saturday. The town first flooded on Wednesday after more than two months\u2019 worth of rain fell in two days, causing the River Steeping to burst its banks. On Friday, three RAF helicopters dropped 270 one-tonne sandbags in an attempt to repair the bank. Conservative MP for Boston and Skegness, Matt Warman, told the Press Association on Saturday evening that \u201cthe Environment Agency is in the process of putting together two pumps that will start taking away some quantities of water\u201d, but he was unsure when they would be up and running. He also suggested the Environment Agency and other authorities may need to consider in future what could have been done better to prevent the deluge, but said \u201cultimately, that level of water was always going to cause problems\u201d. Warman also praised the multi-agency response to the flooding. He added: \u201cIn terms of the response, we have seen an incredible working together of the agencies. \u201cLocal people should keep an eye on the police because there is still the potential for risk to homes and lives. \u201cBut in the long term, it will always just be a huge thank you.\u201d Lincolnshire police have shared a list of more than 100 postcodes, all in the PE23 and PE24 area, where evacuations are possible. The force said on Saturday afternoon: \u201cSome occupiers in this area were advised to leave in this area yesterday. Our advice still remains and has been extended to around 300 homes (in addition to the 290 already advised and assisted to evacuate).\u201d The Maritime and Coastguard Agency are assisting with the evacuations. They said: \u201cHM Coastguard is assisting other emergency services and authorities in Lincolnshire this afternoon in response to further flooding. \u201cOn Saturday 15 June, HM Coastguard is assisting with the evacuation of approximately 300 properties in Wainfleet. \u201cThree coastguard rescue teams are on scene through the afternoon and the teams which are responding are from Mablethorpe, Skegness and Wrangle in Lincolnshire.\u201d City of Lincoln council said the temporary repairs had since \u201cstarted to deteriorate\u201d and another military helicopter had been deployed to deliver more ballast. Among the residents already affected by the floods was Jean Hart, who said she and her husband had been left with only their pets and the clothes they were wearing after the river burst its banks on Wednesday. \u201cThe whole of the bottom of our house is completely gone. Everything\u2019s floating, including our beds,\u201d Hart told Lincolnshire Live. \u201cWe recently renovated the whole of the first floor, but now everything we own is in foul water at the moment.\u201d River levels in Wainfleet are expected to remain very high for the next few days and residents have been advised to leave and stay with friends or family, or at the Richmond school in Skegness. Lincolnshire police asked the public not to \u201cimpede\u201d their work by flying drones in the area while they attempt to rescue residents and monitor the river with a helicopter. During a washout week of intense rainfall, the Environment Agency issued dozens of flood warnings \u2013 largely across the Midlands, the north-west and the north-east \u2013 with 16 still in place across England. On Thursday, passengers on a London-to-Nottingham service were stranded in Corby, Northamptonshire, for up to eight hours after torrential rain caused a landslip. Commuters were eventually transferred to a second train but that also became stuck because of flooding on the line. East Midlands Trains were still experiencing disruption due to flooding on Saturday, with passengers advised to completely avoid travelling to and from Skegness. There is little respite expected as the Met Office warned that another batch of bad weather is on the horizon. Meteorologist Simon Partridge said: \u201cThere is the potential for some thundery and heavy rain on Tuesday and Wednesday. A little bit of uncertainty about when it will arrive but it will be pushing in from the south and will leave from north-east England. \u201cEngland and Wales will have spells of heavy and thundery rain.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "If Karen Bardsley had collected a pound every time a man told her female goalkeepers are rubbish she would be very rich indeed. \u201cWhether it\u2019s people feeling threatened by women\u2019s football, I don\u2019t know,\u201d she says in her distinctive Californian accent. \u201cI don\u2019t know why some people can\u2019t praise when they see something done well \u2013 even if it is by a woman. I\u2019m not here trying to burn a bra or anything and say: \u2018We need to take over,\u2019 but give credit where it\u2019s due.\u201d The England and Manchester City goalkeeper \u2013 who was rested from Friday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Argentina \u2013 sometimes suspects that patronising comments about the supposed limitations of her female counterparts are really a form of shorthand for dismissing the entire women\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of a cop-out, isn\u2019t it, just an easy way out,\u201d says the 34-year-old, who was born and raised in Santa Monica. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve seen my share of bad goalkeeping. I\u2019ve had my moments too. But I\u2019ve also seen some excellent female goalkeeping. \u201cIt does frustrate me; it makes me think: \u2018Come on, let\u2019s see you do better.\u2019 It would be fun to get the general population doing stuff with us. To say: \u2018If you think it\u2019s so easy, get in goal.\u201d Bardsley, who opted to represent England because of family connections in Stockport, believes mixed education is the way to eradicate such prejudice. \u201cFemale goalkeepers are seen as equals in academies now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set a good example for the younger boys so they\u2019re used to seeing us women around, making great saves and scoring great goals. Just normalising the idea of women playing football is a massive part of what we need to do.\u201d As befits a highly articulate product of California State University, where she majored in graphic design, Bardsley has a compelling blueprint for change. \u201cBoys and girls should play alongside each other in academies [at professional clubs],\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past but health and safety have stepped in and stopped us. But I did it when I was growing up in the US. I trained alongside full-grown men at college and worked with some great male keepers. It helped me 100% with speed of play, speed of reactions and strength. The mindset they gave me was invaluable. \u201cIf you speak to girls who play football alongside lads they\u2019ll tell you that you almost have to earn the right to play with them. It\u2019s annoying that you have to do that, but once you\u2019ve done it the barriers are down.\u201d Technically, the differences between the sexes are perhaps surprisingly small. \u201cTypically, male goalkeepers play a bit higher,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir reaction speed in terms of angles and parrying shots means they\u2019ll probably be three yards further out than us. But, technically, the set positions are just the same.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes, has reopened a long-running debate about whether female goalkeepers\u2019 invariably smaller stature dictates that the frames of their goals should be contracted. \u201cWhat are the social implications?\u201d says Bardsley. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought so hard to change the perception of female athletes across the planet and I don\u2019t know that it would be beneficial.\u201d Hers is a powerful, distinctive voice epitomised by the opening exchanges to this interview with a handful of journalists on the Normandy coast. KB: \u201cBonjour, tout le monde. Are we good?\u201d Press: \u201cYes, Deauville\u2019s a nice town KB: \u201cIt looks like a fake town, doesn\u2019t it?

Look at Ederson, Alisson and the impacts they\u2019ve made by playing out, but also being good shot stoppers and having a presence. It\u2019s an impactful position now. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you influence the back four, how you communicate with those in front of you.

Jermain Defoe and Peter Crouch scored in that 2-1 win but defeats by Italy and Portugal followed.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2004&nbsp;</b>England struggled in qualifying, finishing third, 11 points behind group winners Turkey. Joey Barton, Joe Cole and Phil Jagielka featured.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2006&nbsp;</b>Another failure to get to the finals, this time with Peter Taylor as coach.

If they haven\u2019t, then changing leader is not going to change our fortunes.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, Lord (John) Kerr, former UK ambassador to Brussels and the author of article 50, attacks the leadership candidates for making promises on Brexit that they will never be able to meet.</p> <p>\u201cWhat alarms me most about the current Conservative party leadership race is that fiction and fantasy are back, and harsh facts again forgotten, as new promises, no less unrealistic, are made. The unicorns are back, frolicking in the Tory forest. Claims that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated ignore the solemn undertakings given by the UK government in March that it will not seek to do so, as well as the EU\u2019s repeated statements saying it will not do so.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, former Tory leadership contender Esther McVey has come out in support of Boris Johnson. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, McVey \u2013 who was eliminated in the first ballot of MPs \u2013 said Johnson had agreed to back her agenda for \u201cblue collar Conservatism\u201d.</p>",

Will he respond by suspending parliament? Will he seek a general election? This lack of clarity is helping him maintain a broad base of support for now but it won\u2019t survive the autumn. This is why his position on Brexit needs to be tested thoroughly now.\u201d Alistair Burt, the former foreign office minister, said: \u201cThe risk of a serious confrontation in the party seems to be growing \u2013 the only way to avoid this is to get a deal. Jeremy Hunt is the best bet to open up the impasse, otherwise \u2026 we seem to be heading for a disastrous general election, with all the risks.\u201d It comes as former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke reveals he would be prepared to vote down a Conservative government led by a new prime minister who tried to push through a no-deal Brexit, which a majority of MPs in parliament oppose. In an interview with the Observer, Clarke said that in those circumstances \u201cthen you have to bring that government down\u201d. \u201cIf some idiot was sailing into a no-deal Brexit I\u2019d decide politics had finally gone mad and vote against it.\u201d Clarke also said that if it came down to a choice between no deal and a second referendum, he would abandon his lifelong opposition to referendums and back a second public vote. \u201cIf the choice eventually became no deal or a second referendum, then they\u2019d try to win my support \u2013 I\u2019d stop abstaining and I\u2019d vote for it.\u201d Writing in Sunday\u2019s Observer, Johnson\u2019s closest challenger for the leadership, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt, takes a swipe at Johnson over his lack of credibility on the world stage. Hunt says that with the UK facing not only Brexit but a series of threats, including Russian aggression, Chinese resurgence and instability in the Middle East, the UK needs a leader with an internationalist outlook. \u201cWe cannot become the party that pulls up the drawbridge or sticks two fingers up to the rest of world,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt has never been more important to re-engage.\u201d Tory moderates are already convinced Johnson has adopted a Brexit strategy that is impossible to deliver. Former universities minister Sam Gyimah said: \u201cThere is no sweet spot between what the [European Research Group] sees as the ideal resolution and what is right for the party and country. You either please them and imperil the government, country and party, or you pivot away from them and your own position is at risk. This is going to come to a head pretty quickly. \u201cFor all the differences, this is Theresa May\u2019s script. He will try to say he believes in the project and wants to deliver Brexit, but it is parliament that is standing in the way. This is what Theresa May attempted.\u201d Alan Duncan, a senior foreign office minister, said: \u201cThose more moderate colleagues who are tempted by Johnson need to think if the arithmetic or issues have in any way changed. If they haven\u2019t, then changing leader is not going to change our fortunes.\u201d On Sunday, Lord (John) Kerr, former UK ambassador to Brussels and the author of article 50, attacks the leadership candidates for making promises on Brexit that they will never be able to meet. \u201cWhat alarms me most about the current Conservative party leadership race is that fiction and fantasy are back, and harsh facts again forgotten, as new promises, no less unrealistic, are made. The unicorns are back, frolicking in the Tory forest. Claims that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated ignore the solemn undertakings given by the UK government in March that it will not seek to do so, as well as the EU\u2019s repeated statements saying it will not do so.\u201d Meanwhile, former Tory leadership contender Esther McVey has come out in support of Boris Johnson. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, McVey \u2013 who was eliminated in the first ballot of MPs \u2013 said Johnson had agreed to back her agenda for \u201cblue collar Conservatism\u201d.",

Several people used the opportunity to ask an urgent query: \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p> <p>Then there was his launch event, which featured the slogan: \u201cPromising, Delivering, Brexit.\u201d Except, there was a pink line through \u201cpromising\u201d. Was it highlighted? Was it crossed out? Was he having the decency to renege on his Brexit pledge immediately, saving us the bother of the inevitable implosion? It still isn\u2019t clear.

      "bodyText": "Quote of the week \u2018I am personally pining for Big Ben\u2019s bongs\u2019 For a candidate who had recently admitting taking cannabis, this was a brave way for Andrea Leadsom to talk about parliament\u2019s refurbishment. Tweet of the week \u2018Could be worse\u2026\u2019 Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls has his say over whether \u201cHancock Out\u201d is an appropriate headline for the end of Matt Hancock\u2019s leadership bid. Endorsement of the week Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly both backed Boris Johnson. The pair had been so impressed with his skills during their time working with him as London mayor that they both initially ran against him for the leadership. It\u2019s still unclear what had made them nervous about a man who commissioned buses without windows and a cable car that has fewer users than Johnson\u2019s estuary airport, which was never actually built. Before any crucial EU talks, it was surely his negotiating skills that convinced them. Who could deny his credentials, having bought three water cannon from Germany, refurbished them, and sold them for scrap at a \u00a3300,000 loss? That should put Angela Merkel on notice. Theme of the week No deal. The Tory leadership race has often resembled a battle to replace the captain of the Titanic halfway through its maiden voyage. Yet this spectacle now has another unlikely twist, with contenders openly cheering on the iceberg. Yes, a willingness to embrace a no-deal Brexit has become an essential part of any candidate\u2019s armoury \u2013 in this case, in the form of a gun pointing straight at the country\u2019s temples. Dom Raab and Johnson have their revolvers primed. Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Michael Gove just want it lying casually on the desk at EU talks. That just leaves Rory Stewart, the only contender sane enough to rule out no deal. But in this catch-22 contest, if you\u2019re sane, you\u2019ll never be leader. Gaffe of the week Asked about her past misdemeanours, Leadsom admitted: \u201cI may have occasionally cycled on a pavement as a child.\u201d Her pathetic rap sheet made her bid for Downing St look laughable. Taking class A drugs is the bare minimum for any serious contender. Frontrunners really need to have discussed beating up a journalist and, ideally, imperilled a British citizen held captive abroad. Come back when you\u2019ve robbed a bank or two, Andrea. Campaign of the week Mark Harper No one could have failed to be captivated by Mark Harper\u2019s bid for No 10, but just in case, let\u2019s recap. Spontaneity wasn\u2019t a strong suit. At his launch, Harper insisted: \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to be that scripted.\u201d Unfortunately, that was one of several lines pre-released to the media. His Twitter game seemed strong, asking social media users to \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d. Several people used the opportunity to ask an urgent query: \u201cWho are you?\u201d Then there was his launch event, which featured the slogan: \u201cPromising, Delivering, Brexit.\u201d Except, there was a pink line through \u201cpromising\u201d. Was it highlighted? Was it crossed out? Was he having the decency to renege on his Brexit pledge immediately, saving us the bother of the inevitable implosion? It still isn\u2019t clear. At the end of all this, Harper\u2019s bid ended in inexplicable failure. Good week Purveyors of canned goods Stock up the larder. Ready the tins of fruit cocktail. The leadership race is making no-deal Brexit more likely. Lorraine Kelly Having made her dislike of former colleague Esther McVey clear, the daytime TV queen spoke for the nation, saying she was \u201csick to the back teeth of the whole toxic political atmosphere\u201d. Next week, Anthea Turner on the housing crisis. Bad week Transparency Several hustings have been held in private, meaning the success or otherwise of the candidates has been mediated to the press via their supporters (\u201cJeremy was amazing, better than Churchill. People were weeping! You had to be there\u2026\u201d). Never one to let sunshine in on magic, Johnson continues to lie low, having been Sellotaped to a chair in Lynton Crosby\u2019s basement. The candidate markets UP: Michael Gove, Rory Stewart After his cocaine admission, his team have managed to draw a line under the issue. Stewart\u2019s walking tour of Britain saw the outsider secure enough support to carry on rambling. DOWN (and out): Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper, Esther McVey So long. See you for the next contest later this year? Just so you don\u2019t forget him, that\u2019s Matt Hancock pictured left.",

This game of golf, it\u2019s a gentleman\u2019s game.\u201d Handily, Reed carries three versions of the wedge in question to each tournament, meaning he had another one in his bag for a third round of 72. He labels the clubs, which have 61 degrees of loft, \u201c61 and done\u201d. Reed explained: \u201cUsually it gets me out of jail, it kept me in jail on that one. \u201cPlayers, even at this level and whether you are playing well or poorly, any time you hit a bad golf shot or find a really bad spot, you are always upset. You aren\u2019t going to be happy and smiling when you hit a bad golf shot, especially when you hit four in a row after a solid drive.\u201d The double bogey racked up by Reed at the hole in question meant he survived the halfway cut by only one shot. Saturday\u2019s round moved him to an aggregate of plus three, meaning he remains outside the US Open top 50 with 18 holes to play. In his previous four major starts before Pebble Beach, Reed had a best finish of tied 28th and two missed cuts. Frustration about the general state of his game is not difficult to trace. \u201cI knew [what the cut was] but I wasn\u2019t worried about the cut line,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not out here to just make cuts, I\u2019m out here trying to win golf tournaments. It didn\u2019t matter to me whether the cut was one over, two over, seven over. I was more upset about making double bogey on the last than just making a cut.\u201d Reed offered a smile when asked when he last snapped a club. \u201cIt happened three times last year; I got off commercial flights and there was a broken club in my bag,\u201d said the 28-year-old. \u201cI have no clue when I last did it.\u201d That he \u201cdid it\u201d here will linger as one of the abiding memories of the tournament.",

      "body": "<p>Since he entered parliament in 1970, Kenneth Clarke has served under eight Conservative leaders, from Edward Heath to Theresa May. He has also stood three times, in 1997, 2001 and 2005, to be Tory leader himself during difficult periods for his party. But throughout it all he has never known a political crisis remotely like the present.</p> <p>Now aged 78, he still describes himself as \u201ca natural optimist\u201d. But a combination of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are testing his positive thinking to its limits.</p> <p>\u201cAs someone who has seen a few leadership elections in my time, this one\u2019s quite different,\u201d Clarke said in an interview with the <em>Observer </em>last week, within hours of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/13/conservative-leadership-tory-mps-start-voting-for-new-leader-live-news\" title=\"\">the announcement that Boris Johnson had stormed into the lead </a>in the first round. \u201cThis is a tragic farce of a crisis in which anger and protest are wide sentiments across the public scene. The Conservative party is in turmoil internally and deeply unpopular with the general public.\u201d</p> <p>As a lifelong europhile its hurts Clarke, who as father of the House of Commons is its most senior MP, to think that he will be retiring at the next election with what he calls this \u201cextreme crisis\u201d caused by Brexit overshadowing everything. He describes leaving the EU as a \u201ccrazy decision\u201d \u2013 one which will leave in ruins much of what he has tried to do over the past five decades.</p> <p>\u201cMy entire political career has been based on building up Britain\u2019s political standing and economic prosperity through our membership of the EU and the European project,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s all come to an end and the political system and parliament is in such mayhem and incapable of dealing with the crisis that this referendum has provoked.\u201d</p> <p>He is also dismayed by the way the Tory party is going about choosing its new leader and the country\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cThere\u2019s an air of fantasy about just about every candidate\u2019s campaign,\u201d he says, with promises being made on Brexit that cannot be met. And the way the eventual decision will be handed over to the Tory membership, he finds simply \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cMost dictatorships have a better way of choosing their leader than this one.\u201d</p> <p>On Boris Johnson, Clarke is withering in a way that borders on contempt. He says he was a \u201cdisaster\u201d as foreign secretary, and when asked if he could be equally terrible as prime minister, he answers in an instant. \u201cYes, he certainly has the potential to be. Unless he suddenly starts taking it seriously. I am not sure he knows what he would do to get us through the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWith the exception of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/11/tory-leadership-campaigns-hancock-claims-early-commons-brexit-vote-could-lead-to-eu-offering-backstop-concessions-live-news\" title=\"\">Rory Stewart</a> [the most pro-EU candidate, who Clarke is backing] they seem to be implying that they have some magic key to changing reality and getting the withdrawal agreement re-opened, or getting some marvellous technology that can check every lorry crossing the Irish border without having to have any customs officers there. The idea that we just leave on 31 October with no deal is utterly farcical.\u201d</p> <p>That the Tory party\u2019s most senior MP and highly respected elder statesman, who has been chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, health secretary, education secretary and lord chancellor, can describe the probable next Conservative prime minister in such a way, and the entire political system as in the grip of a self-inflicted crisis, is remarkable. And it is not just an isolated view from one veteran politician.</p> <p>Many at Westminster share Clarke\u2019s analysis that politics is utterly broken, and that what is currently happening, particularly with the Tory party leadership, could well make things worse. Most MPs, though, are far more discreet about saying so, as their careers lie ahead of them. Clarke, by contrast, no longer has ambitions to fulfil nor does he feel he has to answer to his local party. He says precisely what he thinks. And much of what he says resonates very widely with the public, as shown by the striking polling and focus group work <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/15/divided-pessimistic-angry-survey-reveals-bleak-mood-of-pre-brexit-uk\">conducted by Britain Thinks that we publish today</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d792836b83f2e41b52aaf1cd69dbf3693090d79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d792836b83f2e41b52aaf1cd69dbf3693090d79/1134_685_3690_2214/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart, who has the backing of Ken Clarke, launches his bid to become leader of the Conservative party and prime minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart, who has the backing of Ken Clarke, launches his bid to become leader of the Conservative party and prime minister.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Britain Thinks examination of the nation\u2019s confidence levels and views of its leaders uncovered a deep pessimism and extraordinary distrust of politicians.</p> <p>Some 74% of voters say the British political system is not fit for purpose, with only 6% saying that UK politicians understand them, and 72% saying they don\u2019t. Some 52% think that Johnson will be the next prime minister, but only 21% have faith that the next prime minister, whoever it may be, will be up to the job.</p> <p>The polling found people felt more engaged with politics post-Brexit, but that extra engagement seems to have left them more frustrated than ever at their politicians\u2019 failings.</p> <p>\u201cI feel pessimistic about the future simply because of the uncertainty, not knowing what\u2019s to come and the lack of trust I have in all politicians and all parties,\u201d said one focus group participant in Leicester. Increasingly, also, Britain\u2019s inability to cope with its political crisis is being noticed abroad.</p> <p>The latest cover of <em>Time</em> magazine is headlined \u201cHow Britain went Bonkers. The Brexit fiasco\u201d with a picture of Theresa May and Tory leadership contenders, including Johnson, on top of a London bus grinning, as the bus sinks.</p> <p>Scott Wightman, Britain\u2019s outgoing senior diplomat in Singapore <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/brexit-shambles-has-ruined-uk-reputation-says-senior-diplomat\" title=\"\">said in a valedictory note last week</a> that the UK was now seen overseas as a country beset by division and oblivious to truth. The nation that Singaporeans \u201cadmired for stability, common sense, tolerance and realism grounded in fact, they see beset by division, obsessed with ideology, careless of the truth \u2026\u201d He added: \u201cI fear many around the world share their view.\u201d</p> <p>Today John Kerr, a former UK ambassador to the EU and the author of article 50, says he is dismayed by the false promises being pushed out by the Tory leadership candidates, which will be treated with disdain by the EU if and when they have to try to deliver on them.</p> <p>\u201cWhat alarms me most about the current Conservative party leadership race is that fiction and fantasy are back, and harsh facts again forgotten,\u201d Kerr says. \u201cThe unicorns are back, frolicking in the Tory forest.\u201d</p> <p>He says the claims by Johnson and others that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated \u201cignore the solemn undertakings given by the UK government in March that it will not seek to do so, as well as the EU\u2019s repeated statements saying it will not do so\u201d.</p> <p>All this feeds the impression abroad that UK politicians are not operating in the real world any more. \u201cMargaret Thatcher and John Major knew that bluff and bravado doesn\u2019t work in Brussels. Not paying what we owe, and have promised to pay, wouldn\u2019t change the game in our favour: it would end it. And, as the CBI and TUC rightly warn, leaving with no deal, and hence no transition period, would be catastrophic. \u201cNo deal isn\u2019t backed by the country, or the Commons. So it really matters that an auction of promises to ultras doesn\u2019t become determinant of our nation\u2019s future. Facts matter.</p> <p>The central promise of Johnson\u2019s campaign is that he will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, saying that not to do so would be a betrayal. The implication is that parliament will not be allowed to stand in the way of Brexit.</p> <p>His supporters hope that if he wins among Tory members in the country, he could instantly revive morale and win back the many Brexit-supporting voters who have deserted to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Some believe he could then call a general election in early autumn, to gain his own mandate from the country to take the UK out of the EU on time.</p> <p>But while Johnson looks on course to win the leadership of the Tory party, that is as much as it would be wise to predict. Honouring his promise to deliver Brexit will be no easy task. \u201cIf we get lured into thinking that Boris solves everything, we could be in for a very nasty surprise indeed,\u201d said one former minister last week. \u201cHe could actually make this whole crisis much, much worse.\u201d</p> <p>If and when he enters No 10, Labour will almost certainly table a vote of no confidence in a Johnson government that tries to take the country out of the EU without a deal, against the majority will of MPs in parliament. Last Wednesday the Tory MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would be prepared to vote down any government if it tried to act in defiance of parliament\u2019s will.</p> <p>In an emotional statement in the Commons he told MPs that \u201cthe only way of stopping that prime minister [implementing a no-deal Brexit] would be to bring down that prime minister\u2019s government... I will not hesitate to do that ... Even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party.\u201d</p> <p>Clarke told the <em>Observer</em> he, too, would feel bound to do the same and thinks other Conservatives could follow suit, though he does not know how many. Tory MPs bringing down a Tory government? Would that not elevate the political crisis to new levels?</p> <p>\u201cWell, I mean, if there\u2019s no other way ... then you\u2019ve got to bring that government down,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have somebody saying \u2018I\u2019m going to be a dictatorial president for a month or two and fix everything despite parliamentary disapproval. If ... some idiot was sailing onto a no-deal Brexit, I\u2019d decide politics had finally gone mad and I was not going to support this.\u201d </p>",

He has also stood three times, in 1997, 2001 and 2005, to be Tory leader himself during difficult periods for his party. But throughout it all he has never known a political crisis remotely like the present. Now aged 78, he still describes himself as \u201ca natural optimist\u201d. But a combination of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are testing his positive thinking to its limits. \u201cAs someone who has seen a few leadership elections in my time, this one\u2019s quite different,\u201d Clarke said in an interview with the Observer last week, within hours of the announcement that Boris Johnson had stormed into the lead in the first round. \u201cThis is a tragic farce of a crisis in which anger and protest are wide sentiments across the public scene. The Conservative party is in turmoil internally and deeply unpopular with the general public.\u201d As a lifelong europhile its hurts Clarke, who as father of the House of Commons is its most senior MP, to think that he will be retiring at the next election with what he calls this \u201cextreme crisis\u201d caused by Brexit overshadowing everything. He describes leaving the EU as a \u201ccrazy decision\u201d \u2013 one which will leave in ruins much of what he has tried to do over the past five decades. \u201cMy entire political career has been based on building up Britain\u2019s political standing and economic prosperity through our membership of the EU and the European project,\u201d he says. \u201cNow it\u2019s all come to an end and the political system and parliament is in such mayhem and incapable of dealing with the crisis that this referendum has provoked.\u201d He is also dismayed by the way the Tory party is going about choosing its new leader and the country\u2019s next prime minister. \u201cThere\u2019s an air of fantasy about just about every candidate\u2019s campaign,\u201d he says, with promises being made on Brexit that cannot be met. And the way the eventual decision will be handed over to the Tory membership, he finds simply \u201cextraordinary\u201d. \u201cMost dictatorships have a better way of choosing their leader than this one.\u201d On Boris Johnson, Clarke is withering in a way that borders on contempt. He says he was a \u201cdisaster\u201d as foreign secretary, and when asked if he could be equally terrible as prime minister, he answers in an instant. \u201cYes, he certainly has the potential to be. Unless he suddenly starts taking it seriously. I am not sure he knows what he would do to get us through the crisis. \u201cWith the exception of Rory Stewart [the most pro-EU candidate, who Clarke is backing] they seem to be implying that they have some magic key to changing reality and getting the withdrawal agreement re-opened, or getting some marvellous technology that can check every lorry crossing the Irish border without having to have any customs officers there. The idea that we just leave on 31 October with no deal is utterly farcical.\u201d That the Tory party\u2019s most senior MP and highly respected elder statesman, who has been chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, health secretary, education secretary and lord chancellor, can describe the probable next Conservative prime minister in such a way, and the entire political system as in the grip of a self-inflicted crisis, is remarkable. And it is not just an isolated view from one veteran politician. Many at Westminster share Clarke\u2019s analysis that politics is utterly broken, and that what is currently happening, particularly with the Tory party leadership, could well make things worse. Most MPs, though, are far more discreet about saying so, as their careers lie ahead of them. Clarke, by contrast, no longer has ambitions to fulfil nor does he feel he has to answer to his local party. He says precisely what he thinks. And much of what he says resonates very widely with the public, as shown by the striking polling and focus group work conducted by Britain Thinks that we publish today. The Britain Thinks examination of the nation\u2019s confidence levels and views of its leaders uncovered a deep pessimism and extraordinary distrust of politicians. Some 74% of voters say the British political system is not fit for purpose, with only 6% saying that UK politicians understand them, and 72% saying they don\u2019t. Some 52% think that Johnson will be the next prime minister, but only 21% have faith that the next prime minister, whoever it may be, will be up to the job. The polling found people felt more engaged with politics post-Brexit, but that extra engagement seems to have left them more frustrated than ever at their politicians\u2019 failings. \u201cI feel pessimistic about the future simply because of the uncertainty, not knowing what\u2019s to come and the lack of trust I have in all politicians and all parties,\u201d said one focus group participant in Leicester. Increasingly, also, Britain\u2019s inability to cope with its political crisis is being noticed abroad. The latest cover of Time magazine is headlined \u201cHow Britain went Bonkers. The Brexit fiasco\u201d with a picture of Theresa May and Tory leadership contenders, including Johnson, on top of a London bus grinning, as the bus sinks. Scott Wightman, Britain\u2019s outgoing senior diplomat in Singapore said in a valedictory note last week that the UK was now seen overseas as a country beset by division and oblivious to truth. The nation that Singaporeans \u201cadmired for stability, common sense, tolerance and realism grounded in fact, they see beset by division, obsessed with ideology, careless of the truth \u2026\u201d He added: \u201cI fear many around the world share their view.\u201d Today John Kerr, a former UK ambassador to the EU and the author of article 50, says he is dismayed by the false promises being pushed out by the Tory leadership candidates, which will be treated with disdain by the EU if and when they have to try to deliver on them. \u201cWhat alarms me most about the current Conservative party leadership race is that fiction and fantasy are back, and harsh facts again forgotten,\u201d Kerr says. \u201cThe unicorns are back, frolicking in the Tory forest.\u201d He says the claims by Johnson and others that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated \u201cignore the solemn undertakings given by the UK government in March that it will not seek to do so, as well as the EU\u2019s repeated statements saying it will not do so\u201d. All this feeds the impression abroad that UK politicians are not operating in the real world any more. \u201cMargaret Thatcher and John Major knew that bluff and bravado doesn\u2019t work in Brussels. Not paying what we owe, and have promised to pay, wouldn\u2019t change the game in our favour: it would end it. And, as the CBI and TUC rightly warn, leaving with no deal, and hence no transition period, would be catastrophic. \u201cNo deal isn\u2019t backed by the country, or the Commons. So it really matters that an auction of promises to ultras doesn\u2019t become determinant of our nation\u2019s future. Facts matter. The central promise of Johnson\u2019s campaign is that he will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d, saying that not to do so would be a betrayal. The implication is that parliament will not be allowed to stand in the way of Brexit. His supporters hope that if he wins among Tory members in the country, he could instantly revive morale and win back the many Brexit-supporting voters who have deserted to Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Some believe he could then call a general election in early autumn, to gain his own mandate from the country to take the UK out of the EU on time. But while Johnson looks on course to win the leadership of the Tory party, that is as much as it would be wise to predict. Honouring his promise to deliver Brexit will be no easy task. \u201cIf we get lured into thinking that Boris solves everything, we could be in for a very nasty surprise indeed,\u201d said one former minister last week. \u201cHe could actually make this whole crisis much, much worse.\u201d If and when he enters No 10, Labour will almost certainly table a vote of no confidence in a Johnson government that tries to take the country out of the EU without a deal, against the majority will of MPs in parliament. Last Wednesday the Tory MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would be prepared to vote down any government if it tried to act in defiance of parliament\u2019s will. In an emotional statement in the Commons he told MPs that \u201cthe only way of stopping that prime minister [implementing a no-deal Brexit] would be to bring down that prime minister\u2019s government... I will not hesitate to do that ... Even if it means my resigning the whip and leaving the party.\u201d Clarke told the Observer he, too, would feel bound to do the same and thinks other Conservatives could follow suit, though he does not know how many. Tory MPs bringing down a Tory government? Would that not elevate the political crisis to new levels? \u201cWell, I mean, if there\u2019s no other way ... then you\u2019ve got to bring that government down,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have somebody saying \u2018I\u2019m going to be a dictatorial president for a month or two and fix everything despite parliamentary disapproval. If ... some idiot was sailing onto a no-deal Brexit, I\u2019d decide politics had finally gone mad and I was not going to support this.\u201d",

He argues that the tenor of Pezzullo\u2019s speeches and essays tend to present views as personally held, rather than the agenda of the government. His at-times combative approach to Senate estimates also separates him from contemporary custom and practice. \u201cI always thought, no matter what I thought of the senator or the question, you behave as a very humble public servant.\u201d</p> <p>The former Labor foreign minister Gareth Evans, who brought Pezzullo into his political office from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet after the 1993 election, says his former adviser is a formidable talent and a \u201cfiercely committed public servant and fiercely loyal to the government of the day\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/11/senator-accuses-home-affairs-boss-mike-pezzullo-of-intimidation-after-afp-media-raids\">PM 'concerned' that Mike Pezzullo allegedly tried to silence senator after AFP media raids</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Evans persists with \u201cfierce\u201d in his descriptions.

This thinking is arrayed through his wide-ranging public speeches and essays. <a href=\"https://www.themandarin.com.au/100625-michael-pezzullo-know-thy-place-public-servants-and-focus-on-the-facts/\">In a recent speech</a> to the Institute of Public Administration Australia, Pezzullo outlined his vision of the role of public servants. The public service was a creature of traditional Westminster principles, Pezzullo said, an apolitical body, there to support and respect democratically elected ministers, while offering up its extensive policy and strategic experience. Mulgan says it\u2019s a vision that should be applauded.</p> <p>But he worries how that thinking fits with the recent controversy involving Patrick. Mulgan\u2019s concerns are not about political neutrality. Rather, he worries Pezzullo\u2019s intervention could be seen as interfering in Senate estimates, where Patrick is a regular interrogator of senior public servants.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>We look the least independent police force in Australia</p> <footer> <cite>AFPA president Angela Smith</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think the main criticism here would be that the Senate committees are one of the few places where the public service is scrutinised and held to account, particularly senior public servants themselves, who are otherwise faceless, pretty well,\u201d Mulgan says. \u201cIt\u2019s impolite, or a breach of conventional manner, to berate somebody to whom you are expected to give account.

Most notable among the resentments is the Australian Federal Police, which was subsumed into home affairs in late 2017. Before the federal election, the Australian Federal Police Association campaigned to have the AFP excised from home affairs, saying the structure was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/15/federal-police-must-split-from-dutton-ministry-to-save-integrity-says-union\">putting its independence and integrity at risk</a>.

      "bodyText": "In June 1999, the federal Labor leader, Kim Beazley, copped a lemon meringue pie to the face during a public event in Melbourne. Beazley laughed it off. But Mike Pezzullo, now head of the home affairs department, then on the Labor leader\u2019s political staff, didn\u2019t see the humour. Worried about his boss\u2019s personal safety, he took off after the assailant and performed a citizen\u2019s arrest. Colleagues from the time recount the citizen\u2019s arrest story as illustrative of the Pezzullo personality: a person inclined to taking charge, and more inclined to seek forgiveness than permission. They also recall Beazley sending another member of staff after Pezzullo to ensure any ad hoc security intervention played out without incident. Pezzullo was always visible as a staffer, which is unusual in Canberra\u2019s backroom culture, where advisers, Peta Credlin excepted, are inclined to be small targets. He was a big personality \u2013 combative, ambitious and relentless \u2013 controversially something of an enforcer and cat herder with members of the caucus, diligently pursuing the interests of his genial political boss. It was a quality that wasn\u2019t universally appreciated. As one of Australia\u2019s most powerful public servants, Pezzullo has maintained all those qualities, particularly visibility and relentlessness, which makes him a stand-out figure in the risk-averse federal bureaucracy of 2019. John Blaxland, professor of international security and intelligence studies at the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre at the Australian National University, sees Pezzullo as a genuine throwback: an old-school, sharp-elbowed, empire-building Canberra mandarin with a Manichean view of the world who would have been at home roaming the corridors of Old Parliament House in the post-war period; a breed of bureaucrat generally thought to be extinct. Blaxland compares Pezzullo\u2019s ambition to create the controversial home affairs apparatus \u2013 a concept he\u2019s pursued doggedly since at least 2001 \u2013 to Arthur Tange\u2019s amalgamation of the Australian defence apparatus in the 1970s, a revolution for that period, and a controversial one. \u201cHe\u2019s had Sir Arthur in his mind, I think, and he\u2019s been very persuasive,\u201d Blaxland, a critic of the home affairs structure, says. \u201cVery few people have thought about home affairs as much as Mike has, so his arguments are hard to counter. He\u2019s been able to persuade successive prime ministers and ministers that this structure is the way forward.\u201d Some bureaucratic colleagues disapprove of Pezzullo\u2019s high profile. One former department head who declines to be named says senior public servants shouldn\u2019t cultivate their own brands. \u201cI think a secretary should do everything he can to maintain a low profile and not cultivate a separate public persona,\u201d the official says. He argues that the tenor of Pezzullo\u2019s speeches and essays tend to present views as personally held, rather than the agenda of the government. His at-times combative approach to Senate estimates also separates him from contemporary custom and practice. \u201cI always thought, no matter what I thought of the senator or the question, you behave as a very humble public servant.\u201d The former Labor foreign minister Gareth Evans, who brought Pezzullo into his political office from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet after the 1993 election, says his former adviser is a formidable talent and a \u201cfiercely committed public servant and fiercely loyal to the government of the day\u201d. Evans persists with \u201cfierce\u201d in his descriptions. Pezzullo, he says, has always been a \u201cfierce warrior\u201d for the home affairs apparatus he now heads. He says Pezzullo is a hawk on defence issues (\u201cmore so than me\u201d), but is also \u201cprincipled on questions of liberty\u201d. Evans says Pezzullo is a much more complex character than the standard caricature that paints him as a \u201cDutton warrior\u201d - a gung-ho spear-carrier for his portfolio minister, Peter Dutton. Pezzullo\u2019s commitment, Evans insists, is to ideas and public service, not to partisan intrigues and power plays. Simon Crean, who also knows Pezzullo well from his time in the parliament, says the home affairs chief was \u201ca valuable resource for us\u201d because he was always meticulous and thorough during internal discussions about policy and political strategy in the late 1990s and early 2000s. \u201cMike came with a considered point of view, and he\u2019d hammer it,\u201d Crean recalls. \u201cLook, he\u2019s a control freak \u2013 but in that job, home affairs, you need to be\u201d. Pezzullo courts fresh controversy People who know Pezzullo well describe a tough-minded workaholic, a pushy patriot long obsessed with defence and security issues. Some say he can be impulsive, and quick to wade in to scraps. He is also, according to colleagues, very attentive to his reputation, which would be a taxing preoccupation at this historical juncture. Intra-day politics is powered with conflict, and public discourse is replete with ad hominem attacks. Abuse has few limits in the roiling social media age. Being attentive to slights on your reputation is a hobby that could easily lead a bureaucrat into trouble. The home affairs chief invited a fresh round of public controversy this week by getting on the phone to a cross bench senator, Rex Patrick. The general atmosphere was heightened in the wake of two police raids contentious enough to have attracted international scrutiny about Australia\u2019s commitment, or more pertinently, its lack of commitment, to a free press. Australia\u2019s creeping security state, and the lack of countervailing protections for expression and public interest disclosure, loomed large in the post-raid analysis, with open debate about whether journalism had been criminalised in the rush to beef up the power of agencies to combat security threats. For once, Australia\u2019s squabbling media companies were on the same page and ready to rumble. Pezzullo took issue with media comments Patrick made about him in connection to the raids on News Corp and ABC journalists. Patrick had been one of the fiercest critics of the raids, including suggesting there had been a double standard, with leaks embarrassing to the government pursued more vigorously than others. He contended Pezzullo and Dutton \u201cclearly hate media scrutiny\u201d. Pezzullo objected to the commentary, according to Patrick\u2019s account of the conversation. \u201cHe took the view that while I was in my rights as a senator to comment about and indeed criticise his minister, Peter Dutton, I should refrain from commentary about him, the secretary of home affairs,\u201d Patrick said on Facebook. Patrick used his Facebook account of the conversation to wonder whether Pezzullo\u2019s true intent had been intimidation. Patrick has been a voluble critic not only of the police raids but also of the home affairs apparatus. \u201cA phone call from the chief bureaucrat overseeing a national security juggernaut, effectively a ministry of state security, that now includes the national police force, the domestic security agency, the border control agency and a striking array of covert investigative and surveillance capabilities \u2013 a phone call from the home affairs boss is not quite the same as call from the secretary of veteran\u2019s affairs or the health department,\u201d he noted. Pezzullo told the ABC shortly after the story broke that the idea his true intent was intimidatory was bunkum. He said he had \u201cno view and nor should I express a view on how senator Patrick conducts himself on the issues that he chooses to pursue as a senator. My sole request made to him by telephone was to ask that he reflect on his adverse references to my purported view of media scrutiny. His comments were unfounded and not able to be responded to by me in the media as quite properly I lack the public platform that he has, and uses.\u201d Colleagues see the approach to Patrick as more na\u00efve than malicious, although it was clearly ill-considered. Richard Mulgan, an expert on public sector ethics at ANU\u2019s Crawford School of Public Policy, says Pezzullo thinks deeply about public sector practice and tradition. This thinking is arrayed through his wide-ranging public speeches and essays.

The public service was a creature of traditional Westminster principles, Pezzullo said, an apolitical body, there to support and respect democratically elected ministers, while offering up its extensive policy and strategic experience. Mulgan says it\u2019s a vision that should be applauded. But he worries how that thinking fits with the recent controversy involving Patrick. Mulgan\u2019s concerns are not about political neutrality. Rather, he worries Pezzullo\u2019s intervention could be seen as interfering in Senate estimates, where Patrick is a regular interrogator of senior public servants. \u201cI think the main criticism here would be that the Senate committees are one of the few places where the public service is scrutinised and held to account, particularly senior public servants themselves, who are otherwise faceless, pretty well,\u201d Mulgan says. \u201cIt\u2019s impolite, or a breach of conventional manner, to berate somebody to whom you are expected to give account.

It was a little harbinger of professional mortality, a reminder that no one, however useful, is invincible. The words were \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ccounterproductive\u201d. All-consuming expansion of home affairs The home affairs construct is controversial within Canberra\u2019s security community. The proposal to create the super-department was also controversial within the Turnbull government. George Brandis, Turnbull\u2019s attorney general, reportedly used a farewell speech at Asio before departing for his diplomatic posting to London to raise concerns about the power and scope of the new home affairs apparatus. The all-consuming expansion of the Dutton/Pezzullo agency has caused resentment in some of Australia\u2019s most powerful agencies. Most notable among the resentments is the Australian Federal Police, which was subsumed into home affairs in late 2017. Before the federal election, the Australian Federal Police Association campaigned to have the AFP excised from home affairs, saying the structure was putting its independence and integrity at risk. The situation, the AFPA warned, was untenable. \u201cIt\u2019s an embarrassing situation,\u201d AFPA president Angela Smith told Guardian Australia in March. \u201cWe look the least independent police force in Australia - surely the other police forces are laughing at us.\u201d Turnbull agreed to establish the home affairs bureaucracy from a position of political weakness. Dutton, the government\u2019s most powerful conservative, and then a key member of the prime minister\u2019s Praetorian guard, wanted his mega-department, and it would have been almost impossible in the circumstances for Turnbull to decline that ambition. Realpolitik, as much as operational need, drove the on-balance decision to say yes. While home affairs is Dutton\u2019s ambition made bureaucratic flesh, insiders insist it was Pezzullo who pitched it as he moved through public service positions after leaving the world of political staffing. This is hardly surprising. Pezzullo pitched it first to Beazley, who agreed to create a home affairs portfolio, and a coastguard. It is unquestionably his baby. Beazley announced the proposed overhaul in October 2001. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Beazley said Labor would implement a \u201cpowerful, Cabinet-level ministry of home affairs\u201d which would take in law enforcement, including the AFP and the National Crime Authority, counter terrorism, coastal surveillance, including the new coastguard, aviation security, security intelligence, including Asio, homeland security, including the federal protection service, telecommunications interception, responsibility for the protection of national information infrastructure, the customs service and national disaster response. The language is familiar. The proposed ministry, Beazley said, would provide a \u201cpowerful and coordinated focal point for strengthening Australia\u2019s national security and fighting global terrorism\u201d. It would \u201cguarantee\u201d enhanced cooperation between police and intelligence services and defence. \u201cThe home affairs ministry will be the most powerful and focused peacetime ministerial arrangement for coordinating Australia\u2019s domestic security in our history,\u201d Beazley said. \u201cIts time has come and the times demand it.\u201d Its time wouldn\u2019t actually come until the tail end of the Turnbull government, and Blaxland is one of a number of experts who has reservations about whether the apparatus is a good idea. The super-department remains contentious in bureaucratic circles. There are queries about the quality of the departmental culture and debate about whether the problems are systemic or a function of personalities. Blaxland says there are valid arguments that consolidating various law enforcement functions creates operational efficiencies, but he\u2019s concerned about the concentration of power, both because of the \u201coptics\u201d \u2013 particularly bad with the recent example of the police raids \u2013 and because the structure doesn\u2019t promote contestability of advice. \u201cExecutives in home affairs are conscientious and honourable people, but they are in a construct that encourages conformity,\u201d the ANU expert says. He says if home affairs is now part of the Canberra architecture, and his view is it\u2019s now not really viable to pull it apart, then there needs to be mechanisms to guard against the risks. A separate statutory authority, a national security adviser, could provide contestable advice, and there needs to be effective oversight. Blaxland has a new paper coming out shortly that traverses the coexistent problems of great power contestation, environmental catastrophe, and disorder in governance on an unprecedented scale. These are real threats and contemporary challenges, he says, that generate a dark space both intellectually and operationally. \u201cThat dark space consumes Mike\u2019s mind,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a bad thing that someone does this thinking because this is important and necessary work.\u201d But he says it\u2019s important in the defence against the forces of darkness that sunlight is also permitted. \u201cMy concern is to ensure Australia\u2019s security architecture doesn\u2019t corrode,\u201d he says.",

Carlo Robbie, 32, who lives and works in east London, says \u201cthe expenses scandal didn\u2019t change the way I viewed politicians necessarily\u201d, but that the current political crisis has had him in utter despair. \u201cI got very emotionally involved and had to take steps to find a way to detach from it.\u201d He is now retraining to become a psychotherapist and does regular volunteer work. Like 72% of those polled, he does not believe that politicians understand the British public. \u201cAny solution has to come from the middle: it can\u2019t come from the far right or the far left because it won\u2019t unify the country. Somehow the majority in the middle needs to be heard above all the name-calling rhetoric about Remoaners and Leavers.\u201d",

That\u2019s about the shape of it. South Africa sit ninth in the 10-team table ahead of this game, against the only side below them, after three defeats and a washout in their first four (Afghanistan have played one game fewer). Any more slip-ups would render their last four fixtures, for them at least, irrelevant.</p> <p>\u201cWeek one was a bad start to the tournament but that\u2019s done now,\u201d Du Plessis continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put all our energy and focus into the now and what\u2019s coming up next. I truly believe that if we carry those ghosts of the last week with us it\u2019s going to be tough to get out of the hole. But the conversations in the last couple of days, especially with all the rain around, has given me more time to make sure that the guys are on the right path.\u201d</p> <p>Even in this bloated, extended opening group stage it has not taken long for us to get what is in effect the tournament\u2019s first knockout game. Whoever loses this one is essentially doomed. South Africa\u2019s efforts to turn their tournament around could be assisted by the return of Lungi Ngidi, who has missed their last two games, but then again it might not be. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one with fast bowlers as to when they do come back,\u201d says Faf. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position now where we need to win five games out of five so you want your best available for selection. But if he\u2019s not 100%, or even 90%, in a shortened game with a bit of rain around is it worth the risk?\u201d </p> <p>It looks like we should get a full day\u2019s play in Cardiff, though some rain is forecast tonight. This could be considered the most important game of the World Cup so far. There should be fireworks. Welcome!</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And check out the latest standings after the bottom of the table clash \u2026 Ground out it may have been, but South Africa did the job, a win at last. Four more wins needed for that semi-final place. Eeek! Let\u2019s hope they can find some acceleration from somewhere, anywhere.... Afghanistan\u2019s batsmen fell at the hands of Imran Tahir, whose four for 29 wins him the man of the match award. Curtains for Afghanistan I\u2019m afraid. As many of the wise commentators have said in their emails, why aren\u2019t they getting more opportunities? This is THE feel-good story in cricket, the fairy-tale, the miracle. Anyway, that\u2019s it from me. The sky is blue in Manchester -at the moment. The Old Trafford gates open tomorrow at 8.30am. Good evening! Phehlukwayo nails it, twinkling his toes, with a huge six off Nabi over the sightscreen and beyond. Amla 41 not out, Phehlukwayo 17 not out 28th over: South Africa 124-1 (Amla 40, Phehlukwayo 11) Aftab comes back. Amla upper cuts a pedestrian ball which potters down to the third man fielder who potters after it. Aftab pulls out the bouncers, one of them is over head high and called wide. A super yorker nearly crushes Phehlukwayo\u2019s toes, he digs it out just in time. Another wide down the leg side. Let me just quickly file my nails. Amla 40 off 81 balls. 27th over: South Africa 118-1 (Amla 37, Phehlukwayo 10) Three off Nabi\u2019s over, including a big heave from Phehlukwayo. Six needed. Peter Rowntree writes: \u201cTotally agree with Romeo. Not just about Afghanistan but other cricketing developing nations. Problem is that to give a one-off game does little good, and with the mismatch against a full England side creates the same situation we have here. But for goodness sake, let us put out some Lion\u2019s sides and invite these countries to have a series of 4 day games here during our season.\u201d Super idea! 26th over: South Africa 118-1 (Amla 37, Phehlukwayo 10) Rashid again. First ball Phehlukwayo slog sweeps for four, then tries to reverse-sweep but misses, ah that\u2019s better, a cut for four. Just nine needed. 25th over: South Africa 108-1 (Amla 36, Phehlukwayo 1) I can tell South Africa a bedtime story about net run rate. It starts, \u201conce upon a time in 1999, England were eliminated in their own world cup by virtue of ...\u201dthe ending isn\u2019t pretty. As Nabi, smart in his blue pyjamas, bowls on. Amla pulls out his best forward defensive. Two from the over. 24th over: South Africa 106-1 (Amla 35, Phehlukwayo 0) Phehlukwayo has never batted above No.7 in the tournament... what tactics are these? Whatever they are, being thrown in against Rashid Khan isn\u2019t the easiest of situations. Amla squirts a single, Phehlukwayo bats out a couple of dots. 23rd over: South Africa 104-1 (Amla 34, Phehlukwayo 0) de Kock is furious with himself, that not out star was calling for him. Is Phehlukwayo coming out with instructions to up the tempo? In the USA, Anna hopes so: \u201cAt some point, maybe when the RRR went under 1.5, with Faf waiting in the wings, you\u2019d think South Africa would say \u201chell, let\u2019s slog it out now and get it over with\u201d. But no.Maybe they get paid by the hour?\u201d Just after bringing up the hundred partnership, de Kock whips Gulbadin off his toes and is well caught by Nabi at mid-wicket at hip height. 22nd over: South Africa 99-0 (Amla 33, de Kock 64) Nabi bowls, four off the over. And we\u2019ve got an \u201cI agree with Nick\u201d situation on our hands. Tone White writes: \u201c I don\u2019t know who \u201cRomeo\u201d is but I agree thoroughly with his assessment. That\u2019s all!\u201d Old King Cole too: \u201cI agree with Romeo! You\u2019ve got to give minnows a chance to cause an upset.\u201d 21st over: South Africa 95-0 (Amla 31, de Kock 63) Ok, here we go again. Can South Africa up that run-rate at the last? Gulbadin, squinting into the sun, is on the button again. Afghanistan not making this easy for South Africa. You wonder what they could have done had their batsmen managed to bat out the fifty overs in any of their games. Afghanistan\u2019s next two games are against England and India. 20th over: South Africa 91-0 (Amla 30, de Kock 60) Nabi keeps it tight till the fourth ball when Amla, feet firmly not dancing, hauls the ball over his shoulder for four. That be drinks, and any hope of a crazy wicket-tumble off, gone and far away. Amla might even play himself into form. 19th over: South Africa 86-0 (Amla 26, de Kock 59) At the River Taff end Gulbadin takes the ball from Rashid and says, \u201cI\u2019m the daddy.\u201d Four balls later he has his hands on his hips as de Kock pulls and the mid-wicket fielder, Rahmat Shah, loses all track of the ball and it wobbles over the rope. Things aren\u2019t going so well here for Afghanistan to be honest. 18th over: South Africa 80-0 (Amla 25, de Kock 54) A boundary! A boundary! Amla hauls that reverse-sweep out of the memory bank and dabs Nabi down to the rope. And breathe. South Africa hit cruise-control. 17th over: South Africa 73-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 53) And de Kock goes to his fifty, his second of the tournament, with a stunning thwack over mid-wicket off Rashid for four. His second boundary of the over. 16th over: South Africa 62-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 42) Ah Nabi, where have you been? Amla and de Kock are watchful, obvs. One off the over. In my inbox, Romeo\u2019s typewriter is hot with fury about the world cup in general and treatment of Afghanistan in particular. I think most people who know anything about world cricket and how it\u2019s run knew before all this started that India, England and Australia would be in the semi finals and then it would be luck/good performance on the day which decided it. The only bit of interest was always going to be who would be the fourth semi-finalists, and rather than South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka or West Indies it will be New Zealand. I don\u2019t include Afghanistan in that list as they have been marginalised because they are the \u2018other\u2019, more the \u2018other\u2019 than any of the \u2018others\u2019. And restricting the world cup to ten teams is pathetic. No jeopardy for India or England or Australia like this, none at all. At least two groups, better four, have Nepal, Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands or whoever qualifies. The qualifying tournament was much better sport than this, miles better. Since they became full members, only India, Ireland and Scotland have welcomed them. The South African commentators on this match are making fun of them. There is not a single Afghan commentator working in the TV coverage of the tournament. Every other country/team has at least one, and most have loads - and nearly all of them are either irritating, useless, narcissistic or just plain twats. Sometimes all of those. The ICC say you can get stuff in Hindi, Bengali and Urdu on their website but nothing in Pashto. The amount of patronising is shameful. 15th over: South Africa 62-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 42) On Sky, they point out how Rashid is at his best when the batsmen have to attack him. This they most definitely do not have to do today. Unless they suddenly have an attack of the run-rate collie-wobbles. \u201cPlaying with fear, playing for places,\u201d they say on TMS. Amla doesn\u2019t look too fearful to be honest, just rather prosaically out of touch. 14th over: South Africa 57-0 (Amla 19, de Kock 37) A punch and a pull, a pocketful of singles from Amla and de Kock. The current run-rate is 4.07, run rate required 2.06. 13th over: South Africa 53-0 (Amla 17, de Kock 35) Ah, it\u2019s lovely to watch Rashid Khan bowl, right-arm high, whirling, all that expectation in a single wrist. That said, eight comes from the over, including a leg-break cut down to the boundary by de Kock. And that\u2019s the South African fifty. It turns out they do know what they\u2019re doing after all. 11th over: South Africa 45-0 (Amla 16, de Kock 28) Gulbain runs in, is that a rather resigned look he has on that face? Tippety, tappety go the batsmen as the crowd bask, BASK, in the late afternoon sunshine. The Sky win predictor gives Afghanistan a generous one per cent chance. 11th over: South Africa 40-0 (Amla 15, de Kock 24) Rashid Khan again. de Kock is watchful. Our most loyal correspondent Abhijato Sensarma writes: I loved a term The Guardian contributer Geoff Lemon came up with alongside Mr Collins on a podcast during their daily match reviews. He said that if the Proteas lost another match, the only way they would qualify was if we witnessed an egalitarian tournament - \u201cA Lennon &amp; Trotsky World Cup\u201d, as he puts it! So far, just two \u2018mini-upsets\u2019 have really occurred, during Pakistan v England and Bangladesh v Proteas respectively... With both the assured results of today\u2019s matches not really doing much in changing the dynamic of the ground standings, we are indeed in need of a socialist cricketing revolution during the remainder of the tournament! You\u2019re right, in that the way this World Cup is going, we\u2019re going to end up with rather a lot of dead games at the end of the group stages. Which was not the plan at all. 10th over: South Africa 35-0 (Amla 14, de Kock 20) A double bowling change, as Gulbadin comes on. Then a terrible comedy bit of fielding on the boundary by Asghar turns a thick edge one and a bit into four. And at the end of the power play, South Africa have crept into second gear. 9th over: South Africa 30-0 (Amla 14, de Kock 15) Imran Tahir started with a wicket-taking googly, Rahid Khan starts with a short ball that de Kock eyes up then pulls it towards the deep mid-wicket boundary. He gets better, mixing up some googlies and keeping de Kock in the crease. 8th over: South Africa 25-0 (Amla 14, de Kock 10) Hassan again: dot, dot ,dot, then at last an Amla on-drive, green pads straight, bat perfectly balanced. Four. 7th over: South Africa 19-0 (Amla 9, de Kock 9) De Kock plays and misses at one from Aftab that nips off the seam. Then he loses altogether the next ball, only to look down in some confusion to find it down by his toes. If only Afghanistan had another hundred runs, darn it. What did I say? de Kock leans into a cover drive and sends it spinning to the boundary. 6th over: South Africa 15-0 (Amla 9, de Kock 5) Hassan, who has a look of Johnny Depp, is on target once again. Probing with enough bounce to get Amla on his tip toes. The crowd watch on quietly. A maiden! 5th over: South Africa 15-0 (Amla 9, de Kock 5) South Africa struggling to pierce the field, or perhaps they\u2019re not bothered about piercing the field. Caution has not always been their friend in the past. Anyway... a large appeal by Aftab against Amla - they review... I think this is more in hope than expectation to be honest...yes, its missing and Afghanistan have lost their review. 4th over: South Africa 11-0 (Amla 6, de Kock 4) Hassan is tight again and they trot through for three singles A correspondent wonders why there is no Afghan commentator on the sunset and vine rosta. Anyone know? We could do with the expertise really. 3rd over: South Africa 8-0 (Amla 5, de Kock 2) An inside edge no less from Amla off Aftab which goes down to fine leg for four. Amla sensing danger then shoulders arms, then shows us his best forward defensive. There are shadow on the pitch you hear, real shadows. 2nd over: South Africa 3-0 (Amla 1, de Kock 1) Hamid Hassan pulls on his headband and bustles in. Amla is watchful and more watchful and gets his first run with a dab down to third man. They scurry a quick single. And that\u2019s that. 1st over: South Africa 1-0 (Amla 0, de Kock 0) The medium pace of Aftab Alam to open and just a leg bye from the over. No fireworks yet to up the run--rate, but plenty of time for that, plenty of time. The players are in the middle, the sun is out: this shouldn\u2019t take long. Bottom of the table v second bottom of the table. Loser is out. The teams again: South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla, Aiden Markram, Faf du Plessis (c), Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Beuran Hendricks, Imran Tahir. Afghanistan: Hazratullah Zazai, Noor Ali Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Asghar Afghan, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Rashid Khan, Aftab Alam, Hamid Hassan. The game will restart in about ten minutes, with South Africa needing 127 in a rain-adjusted 48 overs. They\u2019re peering at the pitch on Sky - it\u2019s looking good. Graeme Smith, whose dark blue suit is cut to impress, thinks South Africa should finish the game in 25 overs. Afghanistan, remember, were going ok, till they lost five for eight. Do write to me if you have a free moments at tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com with any thoughts. An aside for those interested in tomorrow\u2019s India v Pakistan game: I write this from Manchester where it rained heavily this afternoon and was very squidgy underfoot in the nets at Old Trafford this morning. But it is currently dry and the sun is pretending to be just behind the next cloud. Hi everyone - what a crying shame that collapse was for Afghanistan, from a boring but smart-shoes respectable 69 for two at the rain break to a see-through trousers nightmarish 77 for 7. Some big hitting from Rashid Khan took them into three figures, but South Africa should knock that off quickly, will want to knock that off quickly to improve their hopeless run-rate. But they are in touching distance of ticking off one of the boxes in the five wins they need to get to the semi-finals. Afghanistan, I\u2019m afraid, are down and out. South Africa need 127 in 48 overs. Well after the second rain break Afghanistan\u2019s innings went distinctly raindrop-shaped, very quickly indeed. Tanya Aldred will take you through South Africa\u2019s run chase. All emails to her here, please. Bye! Hamid Hassan sends the first ball of Morris\u2019s over steepling into the skies, and Du Plessis eventually takes the catch only a couple of yards from the bat! 34th over: Afghanistan 125-9 (Hassan 0, Aftab 0) The ball was missing leg stump by a distance, and anyway that over had quite enough drama already. Rashid takes the fight to Tahir, with explosive results! The first two are swept to the rope, and the next two are chipped over coverish. Three boundaries and 14 runs from four balls, and he lifts the next to deep midwicket, where Van der Dussen takes a high catch - another foot higher and that was a six. \u201cThe ball before Rashid was out looked like a no-ball to me,\u201d writes Romeo. \u201cShould have been a free hit if it was.\u201d They think Aftab Alam is out lbw first ball, but the umpire disagrees. Du Plessis sends it upstairs. Rashid Khan has a bit of fun with Imran Tahir, thumping him all over the shop - and, eventually, straight to a fielder! 33rd over: Afghanistan 111-8 (Rashid 21, Hassan 0) Hamid Hassan has a wild swing at the last ball of the over, at perfect yorker length, completely misses it and the ball flies a couple of inches wide of off stump! Still, a wicket maiden from Morris. Morris, probably South Africa\u2019s best bowler today, comes back and he makes the breakthrough, bowling into the left-hander, who has to play and diverts it to first slip, where Amla holds a regulation catch! 32nd over: Afghanistan 111-7 (Ikram 9, Rashid 21) Imran Tahir continues, and both batsmen have a go at hitting down the ground, one high and one low. Both get singles. 31st over: Afghanistan 105-7 (Ikram 7, Rashid 17) Rabada starts with a short one, which Rashid deals with extremely unconvincingly but ultimately successfully, dead-batting it with one hand on the handle while looking in the other direction entirely. 30th over: Afghanistan 104-7 (Ikram 7, Rashid 16) Some minty-fresh preview action for you, if you would like some wider reading at this point: 29th over: Afghanistan 102-7 (Ikram 6, Rashid 15) Rabada gets a little overenthusiastic, with successive wides the result. Then Rashid hoists him back down the ground for a one-bounce four! Another fairly expensive over, which would have been even worse had Rashid actually connected with the wild roundhouse with which he attempted to launch the final delivery into the ether. 28th over: Afghanistan 95-7 (Ikram 5, Rashid 11) Bonus runs! Rashid tries to sweep, misses completely and the ball flicks off his hip and away for four leg byes. 27th over: Afghanistan 84-7 (Ikram 3, Rashid 10) Rabada returns as South Africa attempt to tie up the loose ends of Afghanistan\u2019s innings. The closest he gets is a fine inside edge from Rashid Khan, but the ball doesn\u2019t carry to De Kock and flies wide of him anyway. The previous ball had also gone to the rope, though that was a proper shot, driven past mid-off. 26th over: Afghanistan 78-7 (Ikram 2, Rashid 1) That ball was really travelling, which make\u2019s Markrab\u2019s grab all the sweeter. This has been a horrible crumble from Afghanistan, whose reaction to the game being reduced to 48 overs a side has been to ensure that neither will need even that many. Not a great delivery from Tahir, and Gulbadin leans back and tries to hoist it over midwicket. He fails, Markram plucking a great catch out of the sky! 25th over: Afghanistan 77-6 (Ikram 2, Gulbadin 5) Phehlukwayo v Ikram Alikhil seems to be a one-sided battle. The bowler\u2019s first three deliveries all whip just past the edge of the left-hander\u2019s bat, before Ikram finally gets off strike with a single to backward point. 24th over: Afghanistan 75-6 (Ikram 1, Gulbadin 4) Two wickets in Imran\u2019s last over; two runs in this one. 23rd over: Afghanistan 73-6 (Ikram 0, Gulbadin 3) After Nabi\u2019s dismissal Afghanistan had lost four wickets for one run in 10 deliveries and about five minutes of pure havoc. Afghanistan now really need this pair to dig in. Unpromisingly this is Ikram\u2019s fourth ODI innings; his top score so far is 5*. Another one! Nabi drags onto his stumps and this over starts with a wicket as well! 22nd over: Afghanistan 69-5 (Nabi 1, Ikram 0) What an introduction for Imran Tahir, who in no time at all sets off on two enthusiastic wide-armed celebratory sprints. The first wicket was just a gorgeous delivery, the second a leading edge that fell nicely in what became an extended follow-through. And another one! Afghanistan have lost three wickets for one run since the rain break, and perhaps the game has gone with them! Imran Tahir strikes with his first ball of the day, a googly that rips through the gate! 21st over: Afghanistan 69-3 (Noor Ali 32, Afghan 0) Asghar Afghan, the one change to Afghanistan\u2019s team today, is the new batsman, Phehlukwayo having restarted proceedings with a wicket maiden. South Africa strike in the first over after the break! An edge finally carries to the cordon, where Du Plessis makes no mistake! The players are back out and play has resumed, with Phehlukwayo back in action. Play will resume in 10 minutes, at 4.35pm BST. With the two rain delays a total of four overs have been lost, so each side will bat for just the 48 overs. I\u2019m told the covers are coming off in Cardiff, and that play should be back under way in short order. \u201cThis innings\u2019 syntax is a throwback to associate cricket matches - slow batting for the longest time, which one might sneer at when held in contrast to the high-scoring games played by the elite ODI nations,\u201d writes Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIn reality, the more minor teams learn to play within themselves, and play the best way they realistically can. This is exactly what Afghanistan are doing now. With the likes of Nabi and Rashid batting down the order, late runs shouldn\u2019t be a worry. Batting out the 50 overs and getting anything above 260 is clearly their main priority now! Nabi and Rashid can wreak havoc with the ball too, after all...\u201d No news from Cardiff, I\u2019m afraid. My rain radar map suggests this might hang around for another half an hour or so. There\u2019s a bit of mizzle about, and the covers are coming back on! 20th over: Afghanistan 69-2 (Noor Ali 32, Hashmatullah 8) Du Plessis has so far given Rabada, Hendricks, Phehlukwayo and now Morris unbroken five-over spells. So we can presumably expect a couple more bowling changes pretty soon. Morris\u2019s fifth over follows the recent pattern, bringing a couple of singles and not a lot else. 19th over: Afghanistan 67-2 (Noor Ali 31, Hashmatullah 7) Still no wicket for Phehlukwayo, then, but another decent over for South Africa, just the single off it. Snicko shows a very slight edge, and the batsman is saved! You\u2019d have thought that he\u2019d have reviewed instantly if he was aware of the edge, rather than consulting Hashmatullah first, but whatever, it worked. The finger\u2019s up, and that looks dead on! The umpire\u2019s finger goes up, but Afghanistan go for another review. 18th over: Afghanistan 66-2 (Noor Ali 30, Hashmatullah 7) A single off the first ball of Morris\u2019s fourth over, and then five dots to finish. His first four overs have cost an average 2.75 apiece. Afghanistan are dawdling a little, and on course for an underwhelming 220. 17th over: Afghanistan 65-2 (Noor Ali 29, Hashmatullah 7) Phehlukwayo gives Hashmatullah some width, and it\u2019s cut away for four. The next is hit half-heartedly past cover for a couple, and that\u2019s drinks. Both teams will probably be reasonably, but not overwhelmingly, happy with their efforts so far. 16th over: Afghanistan 57-2 (Noor Ali 29, Hashmatullah 1) This is a lovely spell from Morris, who has offered absolutely no freebies and really bothered the batsmen. Afghanistan score three off the over though none of them are intentional, Hashmatullah trying to leave, failing and getting a single for it, and then Noor Ali edging for a couple to deep backward point. The ball would have clipped the stump, and that will very much do! Chris Morris thought so. The umpire thought so. Afghanistan hope not. There\u2019s a chance it might have been missing leg stump... 15th over: Afghanistan 56-1 (Noor Ali 27, Shah 6) Three overs into his spell, Phehlukwayo is yet to concede a boundary and is going at precisely 2.0 an over. There\u2019s another edge off the last, this one bouncing past slip and away for a couple. 14th over: Afghanistan 52-1 (Noor Ali 23, Shah 5) Morris is pushing and probing here, sending down little heat-seeking missiles programmed to locate the batsman\u2019s edge. They\u2019re just very slightly misprogrammed, keep narrowly avoiding the edge, and then Rahmat Shah clobbers the last over square leg for four. 13th over: Afghanistan 45-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) Noor Ali gets a single, one of two scoring shots in the last five overs. 12th over: Afghanistan 44-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) A double change, with Chris Morris having a go now. He bowls an excellent yorker, with Shah getting an edge to the ball before it clatters his pads, which is what saves him. And then he edges the last as well, but it doesn\u2019t carry to the keeper, who dives to his right but can\u2019t reach it, and is way short of Amla at first slip. 11th over: Afghanistan 44-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 1) South Africa make their first bowling change, and it\u2019s a drama-packed first over from Andile Phehlukwayo. First Shah goes for a sharp single, and Morris\u2019s shy at the stumps hits a divot in the turf and bounces wildly, way over the stumps! Then Noor Ali edges, it\u2019s gathered at second slip but the ball bounced a couple of inches before Du Plessis\u2019 hands! 10th over: Afghanistan 43-1 (Noor Ali 20, Shah 0) Shot! After four dots, Noor Ali cuts square away four, right off the sweet spot. Then the next gets a thick outside edge, but gets nowhere near reaching gully. 9th over: Afghanistan 39-1 (Noor Ali 16, Shah 0) Rahmat Shah negotiates the last four balls of the over without scoring, or for that matter trying to score. Rabada with the breakthrough! Hazratullah pulls, and Van der Dussen runs in from the deep to take a good low catch! 8th over: Afghanistan 39-0 (Hazratullah 22, Noor Ali 16) Hendricks continues, and his over starts with a loud appeal for LBW against Hazratullah, but the umpire isn\u2019t interested and neither is Faf du Plessis, the ball surely heading down the leg side. Then one comes off the gloves, but doesn\u2019t carry to the keeper. After three dots and a bit of dangers, Hazratullah clubs one through the covers for four. 7th over: Afghanistan 34-0 (Hazratullah 17, Noor Ali 16) Ripper! Rabada\u2019s short ball rears up past Noor Ali\u2019s chin, and then the next is fuller and on a lovely line, getting the batsman pushing again. 6th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 16) Hendricks completes his third over at no additional cost. Now it\u2019s actually sunny. The players are back out, and we\u2019ll get back under way very shortly. Happy news! The covers are coming off! The break allows me to see Isuru Udana execute two brilliant run-outs in three balls in today\u2019s other game. Follow it here: Apparently this rain is not expected to linger long, so this will be but a brief pause. For now, though, it is raining. 5.5 overs: Afghanistan 33-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 16) What seems a pretty light rain starts to fall. Noor Ali hits the first past cover for four, and tickles the fifth fine for another, at which the umpires decide to take the players off. 5th over: Afghanistan 25-0 (Hazratullah 16, Noor Ali 8) Two very close shaves here! Noor Ali goes for a risky second, and gets away with it thanks to an enthusiastic throw back to De Kock, which forces him to collect with his right hand high in the air before throwing down the stumps, giving the batsman time to ground his bat. Then Hazratullah hits the last high over midwicket, and this time two fielders sprint backwards in chase. Morris dives, tries to catch but instead shovels it with his fingers further on towards the rope, and the other fails to prevent the four despite a decent dive. 4th over: Afghanistan 17-0 (Hazratullah 11, Noor Ali 5) \u201cI\u2019m getting it as well,\u201d says David in Tooting of the mysterious Sky voices, as Noor Ali spears the ball through cover for four. \u201cSounds like it\u2019s the director calling the shots and graphics, but it\u2019s slightly too low to be able to understand. Very frustrating, as I\u2019m sure it would be a refreshing alternative to the actual commentary for a change. A bit of a glimpse behind the curtain...\u201d That is clearly what it is. It sounds extremely full-on. 3rd over: Afghanistan 9-0 (Hazratullah 9, Noor Ali 0) Hazratullah gets a couple to backward square leg, and then hoists one over midwicket, safely clear of the field but it gets nowhere near the boundary, pretty much stopping as soon as it lands. 2nd over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Hazratullah 4, Noor Ali 0) Hendricks bowls across Noor Ali Zadran, who looks unhappy about it. He waves his bat at the third, which just passes the edge, and thereafter attempts little but survival. Maiden. 1st over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Hazratullah 4, Noor Ali 0) The first ball is a ripper, and nearly saws Hazratullah in half. Rabada can\u2019t keep that up, though - indeed he can\u2019t keep himself up, slipping in the process of sending down his second delivery and calling for some extra sawdust - and after five dots Hazratullah clips a full toss away for four. Anthems done, the opening batsmen head to the middle. Cricket incoming! The teams are out and ready to enjoy their anthems. \u201cSound yellow! Yellow! Sound!\u201d says the mysterious muffled Sky voice, as an ad break comes to an end. Today\u2019s teams in full: South Africa: Quinton de Kock (wk), Hashim Amla, Aiden Markram, Faf du Plessis (c), Rassie van der Dussen, David Miller, Andile Phehlukwayo, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Beuran Hendricks, Imran Tahir. Afghanistan: Hazratullah Zazai, Noor Ali Zadran, Rahmat Shah, Hashmatullah Shahidi, Mohammad Nabi, Gulbadin Naib, Asghar Afghan, Ikram Alikhil (wk), Rashid Khan, Aftab Alam, Hamid Hassan. Though I\u2019m also quite impressed by anyone who can hold four or more cricket balls in one hand. I still think the apples are one of the most impressive things about this World Cup. Is anyone else getting funny muffled bonus voices on their Sky coverage? I certainly am, and I\u2019m annoyed about it. There\u2019s plenty of green on the surface, and it\u2019s really quite windy. Kagiso Rabada will be liking what he\u2019s seeing, you\u2019d have thought. \u201cJust the nature of the week. The pitch has been under covers,\u201d says Faf du Plessis. The team is unchanged, so no Ngidi. \u201cThere was a bit of space for us to make a mistake here or there before, but now our backs are against the wall,\u201d says Faf du Plessis. That\u2019s about the shape of it. South Africa sit ninth in the 10-team table ahead of this game, against the only side below them, after three defeats and a washout in their first four (Afghanistan have played one game fewer). Any more slip-ups would render their last four fixtures, for them at least, irrelevant. \u201cWeek one was a bad start to the tournament but that\u2019s done now,\u201d Du Plessis continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to put all our energy and focus into the now and what\u2019s coming up next. I truly believe that if we carry those ghosts of the last week with us it\u2019s going to be tough to get out of the hole. But the conversations in the last couple of days, especially with all the rain around, has given me more time to make sure that the guys are on the right path.\u201d Even in this bloated, extended opening group stage it has not taken long for us to get what is in effect the tournament\u2019s first knockout game. Whoever loses this one is essentially doomed. South Africa\u2019s efforts to turn their tournament around could be assisted by the return of Lungi Ngidi, who has missed their last two games, but then again it might not be. \u201cIt\u2019s a tricky one with fast bowlers as to when they do come back,\u201d says Faf. \u201cWe\u2019re in a position now where we need to win five games out of five so you want your best available for selection. But if he\u2019s not 100%, or even 90%, in a shortened game with a bit of rain around is it worth the risk?\u201d It looks like we should get a full day\u2019s play in Cardiff, though some rain is forecast tonight. This could be considered the most important game of the World Cup so far. There should be fireworks. Welcome!",

      "bodyText": "Divisions over responsibility for last week\u2019s attack on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman deepened this weekend amid warnings over the danger of a major confrontation in the region, despite hints by Donald Trump about possible negotiations with Iran. Politicians in Britain traded angry blows over the incident, after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, questioned whether there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Iran had attacked the two ships as they passed by its coast on Thursday, rebuffing a Foreign Office assessment that it was \u201calmost certain\u201d that a \u201cbranch of the Iranian military\u201d had carried out the strikes. \u201cBritain should act to ease tensions in the Gulf, not fuel a military escalation that began with US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement,\u201d Corbyn tweeted. \u201cWithout credible evidence about the tanker attacks, the government\u2019s rhetoric will only increase the threat of war.\u201d The comments drew an immediate rebuke from the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who described them as \u201cpathetic and predictable\u201d. Earlier the FCO had said: \u201cNo other state or non-state actor could plausibly have been responsible,\u201d and pointed to a \u201crecent precedent for attacks by Iran against oil tankers\u201d. The row came as tensions between the regional heavyweight and Washington remained high, three days after an attack that sent tremors through oil markets and sparked fears of widespread disruption to the global oil trade, much of which passes through Gulf waters. Iran has denied carrying out the attacks \u2013 the second strikes in a month on Gulf shipping \u2013 disputing footage released by the US military that purports to show Iranian naval commandos removing an unexploded mine from the hull of one of the crippled tankers. US defence officials said on Friday that prior to the attack, Iranian forces had fired an anti-aircraft missile at a US drone that had been monitoring their activity close to the tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Officials said the Reaper drone took images of Iranian vessels closing in on the two tankers that were attacked but did not say whether there was any visual evidence of the attack itself. President Trump has sent mixed signals over how he wants to address the crisis, which erupted as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was in Tehran, carrying an offer of talks from the White House. After Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected the offer, Trump disowned Abe\u2019s mission and tweeted that it was \u201ctoo soon to even think about making a deal\u201d with Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cThey are not ready, and neither are we!\u201d However, in the same interview on his favourite television talk show, Fox &amp; Friends, on Friday morning, in which he said \u201cIran did it\u201d, the US president also said: \u201cThey\u2019ve been told in very strong terms we want to get them back to the table.\u201d Hunt was among several candidates for the Tory leadership to attack Corbyn for his remarks.

He\u2019s me looking on in disbelief, really,\u201d said Spencer. He has never had contact with the actor, \u201cbut surely someone must have pointed out that he\u2019s on the front of <em>Time </em>magazine? I\u2019d like to think he\u2019s got a copy in a drawer.\u201d</p> <p>The <em>Time </em>commission came out of the blue as Spencer was shopping for tartar sauce in Asda. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking I\u2019d like to do something in America, it\u2019s such a rich seam, but I didn\u2019t know how to get a foot in the door. Then this email came, asking me if I\u2019d be interested in doing an illustration for<em> Time</em>. The next day they said they wanted it to be the cover of the international edition. It was mind-blowing.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer, who usually creates his collages on his phone, often on the bus on his way to work as a probation officer, had never before worked to a detailed brief. \u201cIt was very specific. They wanted lots of cliched British references \u2013 Westminster, Big Ben, London taxis, red buses. But I thought, this is <em>Time</em> magazine, I\u2019m not going to be precious.\u201d</p> <p>He had concerns about whether his \u201cquintessentially British humour\u201d would work in the US, and whether his loyal Twitter following would regard the commission as \u201cselling out\u201d. And he was unprepared for the lengthy negotiations with <em>Time</em>\u2019s editors on the detail of the illustration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Coldwar_Steve/status/1139262741796007936\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/tAxFXwEl8v\">pic.twitter.com/tAxFXwEl8v</a></p>&mdash; Cold War Steve (@Coldwar_Steve) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Coldwar_Steve/status/1139262741796007936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 13, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019d get the proofs back, with someone\u2019s face circled and the question \u2018who is this?\u2019 They didn\u2019t like the naked mole-rat coming out of a sewer. They said the image I\u2019d chosen for May was too cruel. They asked for Harry and Meghan to be included; I\u2019d never have put them in myself. And they wanted Sadiq Khan in, even though I kept telling them he\u2019s one of the good guys. So I put him in flying the Trump baby blimp, though his hand is obscured by Roger Daltrey.\u201d</p> <p>He worried that he was compromising too far in \u201cheated negotiations\u201d. But he insisted on keeping Phil Mitchell and Cilla, and had Prince Philip driving the bus (\u201cI\u2019m not sure they got the joke\u201d). \u201cIn the end I was happy with the result. I mean, it\u2019s the cover of <em>Time</em>!\u201d</p> <p>Spencer, 44, grew up in a socialist family in the West Midlands. His father worked at the British Leyland car plant in Longbridge; his mother later became an English teacher. He loved art as a child, but after his application to study fine art at Wolverhampton University was rejected, he had a series of jobs in factories and warehouses. Over the years, depression and alcoholism took a hold, and in 2016 he had a \u201ccomplete breakdown\u201d and attempted suicide.</p> <p>After a period in hospital, he began to make collages on his phone and sharing them on Twitter. \u201cIt was a coping mechanism. If I was creating things, I could focus my mind on that rather than crashing anxiety attacks.\u201d Cold War Steve \u2013 a series of images of Phil Mitchell/Steve McFadden superimposed into cold war scenes \u2013 \u201cdefinitely helped my recovery\u201d.

I could have had a relapse, back to drink and stuff, but this outlet was there for me. It certainly helped me get through it.\u201d</p> <p>Spencer has raised money for the mental health charity Mind from his work, contributing around \u00a310,000 so far from sales of postcards, Christmas cards and other items. \u201cI\u2019ve never before been able to have any influence. Mind helped me, so as things have started to pick up, I wanted to do something \u2013 both financially and promoting discussion around mental health issues.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t know what I would do if couldn\u2019t satirise these repellent, grotesque imbeciles</p> <footer> <cite>Christopher Spencer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He is currently on unpaid leave from the probation services. \u201cIt was getting quite hard to juggle a stressful job with this.\u201d His wife Katy works long hours at a care home, and the couple and their three daughters live in a small rented house in Sutton Coldfield. Katy \u201ckeeps me grounded\u201d, he said, and his eldest daughter, who is 13, finds her father\u2019s new public exposure \u201ctotally embarrassing\u201d.</p> <p>Spencer still sketches out collages on his phone, but now uses a tablet and laptop to finish his pieces. He works at a small kitchen table, listening to the radio \u2013 BBC 6 Music and James O\u2019Brien on LBC \u2013 and occasionally drinking a can of Red Bull.</p> <p>He draws inspiration from the medieval Dutch artists Bosch and Pieter Brueghel. In the foreword to his book, the author Jon Savage also references two historical satirists. \u201cIn his sharp moral sense and his ability to create his own complex, detailed worlds, Spencer is the contemporary equivalent of <a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/an-election-1-the-entertainment-123981/search/actor:hogarth-william-16971764/page/1/view_as/grid\" title=\"\">[William] Hogarth</a> or <a href=\"http://www.james-gillray.org/people.html\" title=\"\">[James] Gillray</a>, both unsparing satirists and social chroniclers,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>\u201cFuture social historians will find much beneath the Brexit headlines if they study these works: they will find an anatomy of contemporary England \u2013 or, to be specific, one particular part of its anatomy, the arse-end \u2013 that might help explain the delusion that has descended on the land.\u201d</p> <p>As Spencer spoke to the <em>Observer</em>, the results of the first ballot of the Tory leadership race came through on the radio. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if couldn\u2019t satirise these repellent, grotesque imbeciles. From the point of view of creating art, it\u2019s a fantastic time, there\u2019s so much material.</p> <p>\u201cBut thinking of my daughters growing up in this world is frightening \u2013 a small, shrinking island, bitter little England.

He has produced a book of his work, The Festival of Brexit, and has begun selling limited edition prints and giant postcards of his collages. But Twitter, where he interacts with 176,000 followers, remains his favourite showcase. His work features public figures in typically English settings \u2013 seaside towns, low-cost supermarkets, working men\u2019s clubs, car boot sales, a nostalgic place of \u201cFray Bentos pies and insipid high streets\u201d. Among the Brexit cast list are Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Theresa May, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn and the Queen. An international presence is supplied by Trump and North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-Un. There are also a handful of figures who epitomise Britishness \u2013 Cilla Black, Noel Edmonds and, most notably, Phil Mitchell, the EastEnders character played by Steve McFadden. Mitchell appears in almost every collage created by Spencer. \u201cHe\u2019s an everyman, an observer, the hero of the pieces, the anchor to the real world. He\u2019s me looking on in disbelief, really,\u201d said Spencer. He has never had contact with the actor, \u201cbut surely someone must have pointed out that he\u2019s on the front of Time magazine? I\u2019d like to think he\u2019s got a copy in a drawer.\u201d The Time commission came out of the blue as Spencer was shopping for tartar sauce in Asda. \u201cI\u2019d been thinking I\u2019d like to do something in America, it\u2019s such a rich seam, but I didn\u2019t know how to get a foot in the door. Then this email came, asking me if I\u2019d be interested in doing an illustration for Time. The next day they said they wanted it to be the cover of the international edition. It was mind-blowing.\u201d Spencer, who usually creates his collages on his phone, often on the bus on his way to work as a probation officer, had never before worked to a detailed brief. \u201cIt was very specific. They wanted lots of cliched British references \u2013 Westminster, Big Ben, London taxis, red buses. But I thought, this is Time magazine, I\u2019m not going to be precious.\u201d He had concerns about whether his \u201cquintessentially British humour\u201d would work in the US, and whether his loyal Twitter following would regard the commission as \u201cselling out\u201d. And he was unprepared for the lengthy negotiations with Time\u2019s editors on the detail of the illustration. \u201cI\u2019d get the proofs back, with someone\u2019s face circled and the question \u2018who is this?\u2019 They didn\u2019t like the naked mole-rat coming out of a sewer. They said the image I\u2019d chosen for May was too cruel. They asked for Harry and Meghan to be included; I\u2019d never have put them in myself. And they wanted Sadiq Khan in, even though I kept telling them he\u2019s one of the good guys. So I put him in flying the Trump baby blimp, though his hand is obscured by Roger Daltrey.\u201d He worried that he was compromising too far in \u201cheated negotiations\u201d. But he insisted on keeping Phil Mitchell and Cilla, and had Prince Philip driving the bus (\u201cI\u2019m not sure they got the joke\u201d). \u201cIn the end I was happy with the result. I mean, it\u2019s the cover of Time!\u201d Spencer, 44, grew up in a socialist family in the West Midlands. His father worked at the British Leyland car plant in Longbridge; his mother later became an English teacher. He loved art as a child, but after his application to study fine art at Wolverhampton University was rejected, he had a series of jobs in factories and warehouses. Over the years, depression and alcoholism took a hold, and in 2016 he had a \u201ccomplete breakdown\u201d and attempted suicide. After a period in hospital, he began to make collages on his phone and sharing them on Twitter. \u201cIt was a coping mechanism. If I was creating things, I could focus my mind on that rather than crashing anxiety attacks.\u201d Cold War Steve \u2013 a series of images of Phil Mitchell/Steve McFadden superimposed into cold war scenes \u2013 \u201cdefinitely helped my recovery\u201d. He has not touched alcohol for more than three years. Then came the Brexit referendum. \u201cThe day after, I sat on the sofa like a husk. I could have had a relapse, back to drink and stuff, but this outlet was there for me. It certainly helped me get through it.\u201d Spencer has raised money for the mental health charity Mind from his work, contributing around \u00a310,000 so far from sales of postcards, Christmas cards and other items. \u201cI\u2019ve never before been able to have any influence. Mind helped me, so as things have started to pick up, I wanted to do something \u2013 both financially and promoting discussion around mental health issues.\u201d He is currently on unpaid leave from the probation services. \u201cIt was getting quite hard to juggle a stressful job with this.\u201d His wife Katy works long hours at a care home, and the couple and their three daughters live in a small rented house in Sutton Coldfield. Katy \u201ckeeps me grounded\u201d, he said, and his eldest daughter, who is 13, finds her father\u2019s new public exposure \u201ctotally embarrassing\u201d. Spencer still sketches out collages on his phone, but now uses a tablet and laptop to finish his pieces. He works at a small kitchen table, listening to the radio \u2013 BBC 6 Music and James O\u2019Brien on LBC \u2013 and occasionally drinking a can of Red Bull. He draws inspiration from the medieval Dutch artists Bosch and Pieter Brueghel. In the foreword to his book, the author Jon Savage also references two historical satirists. \u201cIn his sharp moral sense and his ability to create his own complex, detailed worlds, Spencer is the contemporary equivalent of [William] Hogarth or [James] Gillray, both unsparing satirists and social chroniclers,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFuture social historians will find much beneath the Brexit headlines if they study these works: they will find an anatomy of contemporary England \u2013 or, to be specific, one particular part of its anatomy, the arse-end \u2013 that might help explain the delusion that has descended on the land.\u201d As Spencer spoke to the Observer, the results of the first ballot of the Tory leadership race came through on the radio. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I would do if couldn\u2019t satirise these repellent, grotesque imbeciles. From the point of view of creating art, it\u2019s a fantastic time, there\u2019s so much material. \u201cBut thinking of my daughters growing up in this world is frightening \u2013 a small, shrinking island, bitter little England. I just hope good will prevail in the end.\u201d",

Pradeep used the fast bowler\u2019s method and tried a bouncer. Maxwell hooked it over the keeper for four. The over cost 22. Maxwellball. As Sri Lanka\u2019s death bowlers tightened up and wickets fell at the other end, Maxwell still squeezed each yorker for a single, hustling down the wicket, even finding a three off an outside edge to no-man\u2019s land. Against Sri Lanka at the previous World Cup he shook off the burden of having never scored a century for his country, blasting Australia\u2019s fastest one-day hundred from 51 balls at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Four years later time was against him and he had to settle for 46 from 25. The entertainment of it, and the fact it does not always work, drives some people spare. But the very nature of Maxwell is that he cannot do what he does every game. No one can. His is not an easy repeatable approach. You have to accept that if you want to appreciate his best. From the last ball of the innings, everyone in the ground expected him to try for a six. One last ungainly heave. Instead he stepped across to Thisara Perera, got down low and elegantly swept the fast bowler behind square, exactly where the gap was, between the boundary riders. No one was left in any doubt whose game they had just been watching. It has his name in the title.",

Warren is a member of the faith-based humanitarian aid group <a href=\"http://forms.nomoredeaths.org/en/\" title=\"\">No More Deaths</a>. In January, <a href=\"https://time.com/5508196/no-more-deaths-migrants-border/\" title=\"\">four members were convicted</a> of \u201cabandoning personal property\u201d in a wildlife refuge after they left water jugs in the desert to help migrants. \u201cIf giving water to someone dying of thirst is illegal,\u201d said No More Deaths volunteer Catherine Gaffney, \u201cwhat humanity is left in the law of this country?\u201d</p> <p>In both Europe and America, the authorities claim that aid for migrants acts as a \u201cpull factor\u201d, increasing the numbers willing to risk a dangerous journey. The idea that someone treks across the Sahara, through war-torn Libya and into a rubber dinghy to brave a sea that has become the graveyard for at least 30,000 others attempting that same journey, on the off-chance that they might meet a rescue ship, or sets off on an arduous march through Central America and faces the perils of a life-sapping desert because they are convinced they will find a jug of water at the end, stretches credulity. <a href=\"https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2017/03/border-deaths\" title=\"\">Many studies</a> have, indeed, shown that rescue ships on the Mediterranean do not increase <a href=\"https://blamingtherescuers.org/\" title=\"\">numbers of migrants</a>, but abandoning rescue attempts increases the number of deaths.</p> <p>The authorities are deliberately seeking to erase the distinction between people trafficking, human smuggling and acts of solidarity; to suggest that providing food and water, or rescuing someone from drowning, is of the same character as coercing people across borders to exploit them as forced labour or sex workers. It\u2019s a perversion of the legal system and a warping of our moral sensibility.</p> <p>It\u2019s an approach that suggests that only certain kinds of people are deserving of humanitarian aid. Had Warren been helping Americans or Klemp rescuing Europeans, they would have been hailed as heroes. Their crime was to help the wrong kind of human beings \u2013 those wearing the wrong colour skin, believing in the wrong God, possessing the wrong passport or no passport at all.</p> <p>That\u2019s an obscene moral standard and one that would be unacceptable in any other context. Yet so successful has been the anti-migrant agenda of recent years that there is barely a discussion of such practices. It\u2019s important to resist the criminalisation of solidarity, not just to defend migrants\u2019 rights but also because it is corrosive of civil society and, in the words of the lawyer Frances Webber, helps outlaw \u201cdecency itself\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

In Arizona on 11 June, a jury was unable to reach a verdict on Scott Daniel Warren, a college lecturer accused of conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants after providing them with food and shelter. He faced up to 20 years in jail. He may still do if there\u2019s a retrial. Meanwhile, in Sicily, Pia Klemp, the German captain of the boat Sea-Watch 3, was charged with assisting in illegal immigration after rescuing migrants in distress in the Mediterranean. She, too, faces up to 20 years in prison. Warren and Klemp are the latest victims of a disturbing trend that has gone almost unnoticed: the threat by the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to put on trial anyone who provides rescue or humanitarian help for migrants. An investigation by the website openDemocracy suggests that over the past five years at least 250 people in 14 European countries have been arrested or charged for providing food, shelter, transport or other support to migrants without legal papers. Cases include Martine Landry, a 73-year-old Frenchwoman who helped two 15-year-old Guinean asylum seekers, taking them to a police station to register. She was charged with \u201chaving aided the entry of two foreign minors in an irregular situation\u201d, but was eventually acquitted. Then there\u2019s Dragan Umi\u010devi\u0107, a retired Croatian army officer and a volunteer with the organisation AYS, which provides help for refugees. In March last year, AYS was contacted by a group of Afghan refugees who had entered Croatia from Serbia. He, in turn, contacted the police and accompanied the refugees to the police station to help them with their asylum claims. Umi\u010devi\u0107 was charged with aiding migrants by helping them across the border. The case fell apart when GPS data showed that he had always been on Croatian territory. Nevertheless, Umi\u010devi\u0107 was found guilty of \u201cunwitting negligence\u201d and fined 60,000 kunas (around \u00a37,000). Lise Ramslog, a 70-year-old Danish woman, was charged with people smuggling after giving a lift to the Swedish border to two young immigrant couples, with a small child and a newborn baby. She was fined 25,000 Danish krone (\u00a33,000). There have been similar cases in America. Warren is a member of the faith-based humanitarian aid group No More Deaths. In January, four members were convicted of \u201cabandoning personal property\u201d in a wildlife refuge after they left water jugs in the desert to help migrants. \u201cIf giving water to someone dying of thirst is illegal,\u201d said No More Deaths volunteer Catherine Gaffney, \u201cwhat humanity is left in the law of this country?\u201d In both Europe and America, the authorities claim that aid for migrants acts as a \u201cpull factor\u201d, increasing the numbers willing to risk a dangerous journey. The idea that someone treks across the Sahara, through war-torn Libya and into a rubber dinghy to brave a sea that has become the graveyard for at least 30,000 others attempting that same journey, on the off-chance that they might meet a rescue ship, or sets off on an arduous march through Central America and faces the perils of a life-sapping desert because they are convinced they will find a jug of water at the end, stretches credulity. Many studies have, indeed, shown that rescue ships on the Mediterranean do not increase numbers of migrants, but abandoning rescue attempts increases the number of deaths. The authorities are deliberately seeking to erase the distinction between people trafficking, human smuggling and acts of solidarity; to suggest that providing food and water, or rescuing someone from drowning, is of the same character as coercing people across borders to exploit them as forced labour or sex workers. It\u2019s a perversion of the legal system and a warping of our moral sensibility. It\u2019s an approach that suggests that only certain kinds of people are deserving of humanitarian aid. Had Warren been helping Americans or Klemp rescuing Europeans, they would have been hailed as heroes. Their crime was to help the wrong kind of human beings \u2013 those wearing the wrong colour skin, believing in the wrong God, possessing the wrong passport or no passport at all. That\u2019s an obscene moral standard and one that would be unacceptable in any other context. Yet so successful has been the anti-migrant agenda of recent years that there is barely a discussion of such practices. It\u2019s important to resist the criminalisation of solidarity, not just to defend migrants\u2019 rights but also because it is corrosive of civil society and, in the words of the lawyer Frances Webber, helps outlaw \u201cdecency itself\u201d. \u2022 Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/franco-zeffirelli\" title=\"\">Franco Zeffirelli</a>, who has died aged 96, was not only one of Italy\u2019s most talented directors and designers in the theatrical arts, but was also involved with cinema and television for more than half a century. In any medium, he generally preferred a grand canvas. His work was dominated by adaptations of the classics and lush biographies or histories, told with flamboyance and sentimentality. He had an unerring eye for attractive stars of both sexes such that, whatever their weaknesses, his productions invariably looked good. </p> <p>Though he earned respect and admiration in the many countries where he worked, it hurt him deeply that in his homeland he was not always appreciated as he felt he deserved. Zeffirelli had himself to blame if he often became a target in the Italian press, the result of his mania for freely expressing his controversial views on almost every subject concerning Italian society.</p> <p>Born in Florence, Franco was the son of a dressmaker, Alaide Garosi Cipriani, with an ailing husband. She had become pregnant by Ottorino Corsi, a drapery merchant, whose own wife was to persecute the young Franco for many years, calling him \u201cbastard\u201d in front of other children. Alaide chose the surname \u201cZeffiretti\u201d (little breezes) for her son \u2013 inspired by the title of <a href=\"https://www.opera-arias.com/mozart/idomeneo/zeffiretti-lusinghieri/&amp;yt=27621\" title=\"\">an aria from Mozart\u2019s opera Idomeneo</a> \u2013 but a mistake led to \u201cZeffirelli\u201d being recorded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"040d1dffcae2bc41af77e8d2aaaddffe74e02c4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/040d1dffcae2bc41af77e8d2aaaddffe74e02c4b/0_154_2448_1468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cher with Franco Zeffirelli on the set of Tea With Mussolini, 1999.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cher with Franco Zeffirelli on the set of Tea With Mussolini, 1999.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Franco was six his mother died, and he was brought up by his father\u2019s cousin Lide, who was to remain a substitute mother until she died in 1968. He attended a Roman Catholic school in Florence where, as he revealed many years later in his autobiography, he was sexually assaulted by a priest. He enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence in 1938 and, in his late teens, began studies at the architecture faculty of Florence University, but these were interrupted by the second world war. The atmosphere in the city at this time was somewhat romantically recreated in Zeffirelli\u2019s film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian/0,,39139,00.html\" title=\"\">Tea With Mussolini</a> (1999), and his lifelong love of culture and literature stemmed from the teacher Mary O\u2019Neill (played in that film by Joan Plowright), who gave him private lessons from 1930 onwards.</p> <p>After the armistice of September 1943, Zeffirelli joined a partisan group. During the struggle that followed, as the allies continued to drive the Nazis out of Italy, he came into contact with a battalion of Scots Guards, who took him on as interpreter. </p> <p>Returning to Florence after the war, he decided that the theatre interested him more than architecture. While working as a scene painter, he met the director <a href=\"https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/fast-track-fandom-where-begin-luchino-visconti\" title=\"\">Luchino Visconti</a>, who offered him a small part in his next stage production, Crime and Punishment, due to open in Rome, to which Zeffirelli moved in 1946.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e464c7800adbc5d93f46dae2a3f0682265cd4be6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e464c7800adbc5d93f46dae2a3f0682265cd4be6/0_172_2194_2740/801.jpg\" alt=\"Franco Zeffirelli as an actor, in Luigi Zampa\u2019s film L\u2019Onorevole Angelina, 1947.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franco Zeffirelli as an actor, in Luigi Zampa\u2019s film L\u2019Onorevole Angelina, 1947.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the run ended, he played the juvenile lead in the film L\u2019Onorevole Angelina (Angelina: Member of Parliament, 1947), directed by Luigi Zampa and starring <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1973/09/27/archives/anna-magnani-the-actress-dies-at-65-vesuvian-temperament-a-child-of.html\" title=\"\">Anna Magnani</a>. Instead of pursuing an acting career, he decamped to Sicily as an assistant director on Visconti\u2019s film La Terra Trema (The Earth Trembles, 1948). He was never to regret his choice. Though irritated by Visconti\u2019s double identity as aristocrat and communist sympathiser, he became more intensely involved with the director during the shooting of the film, and when back in Rome he moved into Visconti\u2019s villa. Zeffirelli later said that his relationship with Visconti was one of his \u201cserious love affairs\u201d, in which he was \u201chit right on the forehead and in the heart\u201d.</p> <p>He served as \u201cart director\u201d for Salvador Dal\u00ed when the painter designed Visconti\u2019s exotic stage production of As You Like It in Rome in 1948. The following year he received critical attention for his first designer credit, on Visconti\u2019s production of Tennessee Williams\u2019s A Streetcar Named Desire. In the spring of 1949, he was entrusted by Visconti to transform the Boboli Gardens of the Palazzo Pitti in Florence into a magical \u201cPersian miniature\u201d Troy for an opulent one-off staging of Troilus and Cressida. In 1951 Visconti employed him again as assistant director, this time on the film Bellissima, starring Magnani.</p> <p>When Zeffirelli made his debut as a stage director with Carlo Bertolazzi\u2019s Lul\u00f9, Visconti mocked his protege\u2019s sign of rebellion. Nevertheless, Zeffirelli was tempted back into what many maliciously called the \u201cVisconti stables\u201d to do the sets for Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters (1952). He was also called in as assistant director on the film Senso (1954). After being treated roughly on the set by the ever more despotic Visconti, he was relieved to be released before filming ended, since he had been engaged to design the sets at La Scala, Milan, for Rossini\u2019s L\u2019Italiana in Algeri.</p> <p>His sets so pleased the Scala\u2019s manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, that he was invited back the next season to design another Rossini opera, La Cenerentola. This time he ended up directing it, too. He now found himself hailed as a promising new opera director. In 1954, Maria Callas appeared at La Scala in Spontini\u2019s La Vestale, directed by Visconti. Zeffirelli\u2019s production of Donizetti\u2019s L\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore was due to open in the same week, and inevitably was treated as less important. But he won Callas\u2019s confidence and succeeded in convincing her that she should try lighter roles. She was delighted to let Zeffirelli direct her in Il Turco in Italia, which was a great success for both of them in 1955.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5315d8e8ef4afb34473f355af23a0c066079aaf2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5315d8e8ef4afb34473f355af23a0c066079aaf2/85_0_2446_3056/800.jpg\" alt=\"Judi Dench John Stride in in the title roles of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic theatre, London, directed By Franco Zeffirelli, 1960.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judi Dench and John Stride in the title roles of Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic theatre, London, directed By Franco Zeffirelli, 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daily Mail/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thanks to the conductor Tullio Serafin, whom he respected as another of his mentors, Zeffirelli was invited to London in 1959 to direct Lucia di Lammermoor at Covent Garden with the newcomer Joan Sutherland, with whom he was often to work afterwards. Covent Garden then had the brilliant idea of inviting him to direct the double bill of \u201cCav and Pag\u201d (Cavalleria Rusticana and I Pagliacci). British operagoers were stunned by his realistic staging of the former, and it was this production that convinced <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1974/09/09/archives/michael-benthall-is-dead-at-55-directed-the-old-vic-for-9-years.html\" title=\"\">Michael Benthall</a> to invite Zeffirelli to the Old Vic to direct an \u201cItalian-style\u201d Romeo and Juliet, starring John Stride and Judi Dench, in 1960. The younger actors of the Old Vic company were at first disconcerted when Zeffirelli instructed them to grow their hair long, but later recognised that it made them feel at home in the piazza of Verona, if not in Waterloo Road.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kenneth-tynan\" title=\"\">Kenneth Tynan</a> recognised it as a breakthrough in Shakespearean production. Zeffirelli succeeded in bringing out the genuine Italian feeling in the tragedy, sometimes at the expense of the verse \u2013 as many other British critics were quick to note. He was not to be so successful with his next production in Britain, a confusing Othello with John Gielgud at Stratford-upon-Avon. His third Shakespeare production in English came in 1965 with Much Ado About Nothing at the National, which was a hit.</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/23/how-we-made-zeffirelli-callas-tosca\" title=\"\">he had directed Callas in Tosca at Covent Garden</a> and in Norma in Paris. He had also been back to Italy where, in Venice in 1963, he staged Edward Albee\u2019s Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, one of the last times Italian theatre critics were to give him unanimously good reviews. His Italian version of Romeo and Juliet, first seen in the open-air Roman theatre in Verona in 1964 and then on tour, was even more robust than in London, but again it was to please audiences more than the critics. Back in London, at the Old Vic in 1964, his Hamlet, performed in Italian by the Proclemer-Albertazzi company, was respectfully received.</p> <p>Zeffirelli\u2019s umbilical-shaped set for Hamlet and the \u201ccorridor of the mind\u201d set which he invented for Arthur Miller\u2019s autobiographical play After the Fall, covering up the play\u2019s weakness, were examples of how, as a designer, he was getting close to the visionary concepts of <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Edward-Gordon-Craig\" title=\"\">Edward Gordon Craig</a>. Miller went to Naples in December 1965 to see Zeffirelli\u2019s production of his play, and was particularly impressed by the set and the offbeat casting of Monica Vitti in the Marilyn Monroe role. However, Zeffirelli\u2019s war with the Italian critics continued when he refused to invite them to review his 1965 production of Verga\u2019s La Lupa, which gave Magnani a triumphant stage comeback. His greatest theatrical work in the following years was done for the Old Vic, where he staged Eduardo De Filippo\u2019s plays Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Filumena Marturano, both starring Plowright. </p> <p>In the US, too, in the 1960s, Zeffirelli thrived with operatic productions. He directed an elegant and evocative version of Verdi\u2019s Falstaff, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1964. Two years later, he directed Samuel Barber\u2019s Antony and Cleopatra, which opened the new opera house in Lincoln Center, to which he returned frequently over the following decades.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2781bed89e98e848f566e6e3d8545262967600d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f2781bed89e98e848f566e6e3d8545262967600d/9_57_5662_3397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Franco Zeffirelli, centre, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the stars of his film version of The Taming of the Shrew.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franco Zeffirelli, centre, with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, the stars of his film version of The Taming of the Shrew.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Lees/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1957 Zeffirelli had directed a rather inconsequential Italian film comedy, Camping. His real debut as a film-maker came 10 years later with The Taming of the Shrew, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. As he wrote in his autobiography: \u201cI had already worked with difficult performers like Callas and Magnani so Liz and Richard didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d Even so he had a lot of problems on the set.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d55b320b9e8b9dc9d2a6052ab503b03e99be3ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d55b320b9e8b9dc9d2a6052ab503b03e99be3ae/0_190_3392_2035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Taylor in Zeffirelli\u2019s film of The Taming of the Shrew, 1967.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Taylor in Zeffirelli\u2019s film of The Taming of the Shrew, 1967.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Snap/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The film was well received, and this prompted Paramount to back his English-language film of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/romeo-and-juliet-review-zeffirelli-shakespeare\" title=\"\">Romeo and Juliet</a> (1968), starring the attractive newcomers Leonard Whiting and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/01/olivia-hussey-romeo-and-juliet-film-franco-zeffirelli\" title=\"\">Olivia Hussey</a>, photographed by the incomparable Pasqualino de Santis and dressed by Danilo Donati. It was shot on location in various parts of Italy, piecing together an authentic-looking period Verona. The film was a huge box-office hit \u2013 especially with young audiences not normally attracted to Shakespeare \u2013 and finally solved Zeffirelli\u2019s financial worries, as he had a percentage of the profits. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/18/letter-john-francis-lane\">Letter: John Francis Lane was the ultimate film industry insider</a> </p> </aside>  <p>De Santis and Donati both won Oscars, and Zeffirelli was nominated for best director, but he was unable to attend the ceremony because he had been involved in a car crash when Gina Lollobrigida was driving him to a football match. He suffered severe head injuries and though he was to have facial surgery which more or less restored his appearance, close friends believed that the accident was to blame for his subsequent erratic behaviour.</p> <p>Certainly it prompted a bout ofreligious zeal, as he believed that a miracle had saved him. He dedicated himself to religious films such as Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972), about Saint Francis of Assisi, and the very popular TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth (1977), with Robert Powell, which he considered to be a God-sent mission. He also became the regular <em>metteur en sc\u00e8ne</em> of important Vatican events.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f96730dfeb686787739b08954a62abbda2455361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f96730dfeb686787739b08954a62abbda2455361/0_157_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Powell, centre, and Franco Zeffirelli during the filming of Jesus of Nazareth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Powell, centre, and Franco Zeffirelli during the filming of Jesus of Nazareth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His remake of The Champ (1979), starring Ricky Schroder, proved to be a box office hit. It was pure schmaltz, but the young star and a manipulative screenplay ensured its success. He tried for another hit, reworking Romeo and Juliet as Endless Love (1981), but it was only modestly popular, marking his last foray into the youth market.</p> <p>Zeffirelli then concentrated on a cycle of films of operas. In La Traviata (1982), he made effective use of the flashback device that had not been appreciated at his 1964 Scala production. His 1986 film of Otello was perhaps underrated. However, the Italian musical world would never forgive him for his fanciful film The Young Toscanini (1988).</p> <p>In 1990, he had a popular success with a concise movie version of Hamlet, with Mel Gibson in the lead role. Gibson made a creditable stab at the character, but it did not have the powerful impact of Zeffirelli\u2019s Italian stage production. At home and abroad, he had always loved to work with the biggest stars. In the 80s, he directed two of the Italian theatre\u2019s most adored leading ladies, Valentina Cortese and Rossella Falk, in Schiller\u2019s Mary Stuart. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7c3901def107ffec3d76381357be2ebf07e3986\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7c3901def107ffec3d76381357be2ebf07e3986/0_113_2048_1228/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Franco Zeffirelli joking with the tenor Luciano Pavarotti at the time of their centenary production of Tosca in Rome, 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Franco Zeffirelli joking with the tenor Luciano Pavarotti at the time of their centenary production of Tosca in Rome, 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the mid-90s he made his debut at the Arena of Verona with the most sumptuous Carmen ever staged, even in that home of grandiosity, with 28 Spanish dancers in the ballet. The crowds were ecstatic and it has been revived regularly. A \u201csemi-staged\u201d and star-studded one-off production in 2000 at the Rome Opera House marked the centenary of the first performance there of Puccini\u2019s Tosca, with triumphs for Luciano Pavarotti as Mario and In\u00e9s Salazar as Tosca. Zeffirelli won unanimous praise for the simplicity of the staging on a central rostrum, with the orchestra seated in a semi-circle around it.

      "bodyText": "Franco Zeffirelli, who has died aged 96, was not only one of Italy\u2019s most talented directors and designers in the theatrical arts, but was also involved with cinema and television for more than half a century. In any medium, he generally preferred a grand canvas. His work was dominated by adaptations of the classics and lush biographies or histories, told with flamboyance and sentimentality. He had an unerring eye for attractive stars of both sexes such that, whatever their weaknesses, his productions invariably looked good. Though he earned respect and admiration in the many countries where he worked, it hurt him deeply that in his homeland he was not always appreciated as he felt he deserved. Zeffirelli had himself to blame if he often became a target in the Italian press, the result of his mania for freely expressing his controversial views on almost every subject concerning Italian society. Born in Florence, Franco was the son of a dressmaker, Alaide Garosi Cipriani, with an ailing husband. She had become pregnant by Ottorino Corsi, a drapery merchant, whose own wife was to persecute the young Franco for many years, calling him \u201cbastard\u201d in front of other children. Alaide chose the surname \u201cZeffiretti\u201d (little breezes) for her son \u2013 inspired by the title of an aria from Mozart\u2019s opera Idomeneo \u2013 but a mistake led to \u201cZeffirelli\u201d being recorded. When Franco was six his mother died, and he was brought up by his father\u2019s cousin Lide, who was to remain a substitute mother until she died in 1968. He attended a Roman Catholic school in Florence where, as he revealed many years later in his autobiography, he was sexually assaulted by a priest. He enrolled at the Academy of Fine Arts in Florence in 1938 and, in his late teens, began studies at the architecture faculty of Florence University, but these were interrupted by the second world war. The atmosphere in the city at this time was somewhat romantically recreated in Zeffirelli\u2019s film Tea With Mussolini (1999), and his lifelong love of culture and literature stemmed from the teacher Mary O\u2019Neill (played in that film by Joan Plowright), who gave him private lessons from 1930 onwards. After the armistice of September 1943, Zeffirelli joined a partisan group. During the struggle that followed, as the allies continued to drive the Nazis out of Italy, he came into contact with a battalion of Scots Guards, who took him on as interpreter. Returning to Florence after the war, he decided that the theatre interested him more than architecture. While working as a scene painter, he met the director Luchino Visconti, who offered him a small part in his next stage production, Crime and Punishment, due to open in Rome, to which Zeffirelli moved in 1946. After the run ended, he played the juvenile lead in the film L\u2019Onorevole Angelina (Angelina: Member of Parliament, 1947), directed by Luigi Zampa and starring Anna Magnani. Instead of pursuing an acting career, he decamped to Sicily as an assistant director on Visconti\u2019s film La Terra Trema (The Earth Trembles, 1948). He was never to regret his choice. Though irritated by Visconti\u2019s double identity as aristocrat and communist sympathiser, he became more intensely involved with the director during the shooting of the film, and when back in Rome he moved into Visconti\u2019s villa. Zeffirelli later said that his relationship with Visconti was one of his \u201cserious love affairs\u201d, in which he was \u201chit right on the forehead and in the heart\u201d. He served as \u201cart director\u201d for Salvador Dal\u00ed when the painter designed Visconti\u2019s exotic stage production of As You Like It in Rome in 1948. The following year he received critical attention for his first designer credit, on Visconti\u2019s production of Tennessee Williams\u2019s A Streetcar Named Desire. In the spring of 1949, he was entrusted by Visconti to transform the Boboli Gardens of the Palazzo Pitti in Florence into a magical \u201cPersian miniature\u201d Troy for an opulent one-off staging of Troilus and Cressida. In 1951 Visconti employed him again as assistant director, this time on the film Bellissima, starring Magnani. When Zeffirelli made his debut as a stage director with Carlo Bertolazzi\u2019s Lul\u00f9, Visconti mocked his protege\u2019s sign of rebellion. Nevertheless, Zeffirelli was tempted back into what many maliciously called the \u201cVisconti stables\u201d to do the sets for Chekhov\u2019s Three Sisters (1952). He was also called in as assistant director on the film Senso (1954). After being treated roughly on the set by the ever more despotic Visconti, he was relieved to be released before filming ended, since he had been engaged to design the sets at La Scala, Milan, for Rossini\u2019s L\u2019Italiana in Algeri. His sets so pleased the Scala\u2019s manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, that he was invited back the next season to design another Rossini opera, La Cenerentola. This time he ended up directing it, too. He now found himself hailed as a promising new opera director. In 1954, Maria Callas appeared at La Scala in Spontini\u2019s La Vestale, directed by Visconti. Zeffirelli\u2019s production of Donizetti\u2019s L\u2019Elisir d\u2019Amore was due to open in the same week, and inevitably was treated as less important. But he won Callas\u2019s confidence and succeeded in convincing her that she should try lighter roles. She was delighted to let Zeffirelli direct her in Il Turco in Italia, which was a great success for both of them in 1955. Thanks to the conductor Tullio Serafin, whom he respected as another of his mentors, Zeffirelli was invited to London in 1959 to direct Lucia di Lammermoor at Covent Garden with the newcomer Joan Sutherland, with whom he was often to work afterwards. Covent Garden then had the brilliant idea of inviting him to direct the double bill of \u201cCav and Pag\u201d (Cavalleria Rusticana and I Pagliacci). British operagoers were stunned by his realistic staging of the former, and it was this production that convinced Michael Benthall to invite Zeffirelli to the Old Vic to direct an \u201cItalian-style\u201d Romeo and Juliet, starring John Stride and Judi Dench, in 1960. The younger actors of the Old Vic company were at first disconcerted when Zeffirelli instructed them to grow their hair long, but later recognised that it made them feel at home in the piazza of Verona, if not in Waterloo Road. Kenneth Tynan recognised it as a breakthrough in Shakespearean production. Zeffirelli succeeded in bringing out the genuine Italian feeling in the tragedy, sometimes at the expense of the verse \u2013 as many other British critics were quick to note. He was not to be so successful with his next production in Britain, a confusing Othello with John Gielgud at Stratford-upon-Avon. His third Shakespeare production in English came in 1965 with Much Ado About Nothing at the National, which was a hit. Meanwhile, he had directed Callas in Tosca at Covent Garden and in Norma in Paris. He had also been back to Italy where, in Venice in 1963, he staged Edward Albee\u2019s Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, one of the last times Italian theatre critics were to give him unanimously good reviews. His Italian version of Romeo and Juliet, first seen in the open-air Roman theatre in Verona in 1964 and then on tour, was even more robust than in London, but again it was to please audiences more than the critics. Back in London, at the Old Vic in 1964, his Hamlet, performed in Italian by the Proclemer-Albertazzi company, was respectfully received. Zeffirelli\u2019s umbilical-shaped set for Hamlet and the \u201ccorridor of the mind\u201d set which he invented for Arthur Miller\u2019s autobiographical play After the Fall, covering up the play\u2019s weakness, were examples of how, as a designer, he was getting close to the visionary concepts of Edward Gordon Craig. Miller went to Naples in December 1965 to see Zeffirelli\u2019s production of his play, and was particularly impressed by the set and the offbeat casting of Monica Vitti in the Marilyn Monroe role. However, Zeffirelli\u2019s war with the Italian critics continued when he refused to invite them to review his 1965 production of Verga\u2019s La Lupa, which gave Magnani a triumphant stage comeback. His greatest theatrical work in the following years was done for the Old Vic, where he staged Eduardo De Filippo\u2019s plays Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Filumena Marturano, both starring Plowright. In the US, too, in the 1960s, Zeffirelli thrived with operatic productions. He directed an elegant and evocative version of Verdi\u2019s Falstaff, conducted by Leonard Bernstein, at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1964. Two years later, he directed Samuel Barber\u2019s Antony and Cleopatra, which opened the new opera house in Lincoln Center, to which he returned frequently over the following decades. In 1957 Zeffirelli had directed a rather inconsequential Italian film comedy, Camping. His real debut as a film-maker came 10 years later with The Taming of the Shrew, starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. As he wrote in his autobiography: \u201cI had already worked with difficult performers like Callas and Magnani so Liz and Richard didn\u2019t scare me.\u201d Even so he had a lot of problems on the set. The film was well received, and this prompted Paramount to back his English-language film of Romeo and Juliet (1968), starring the attractive newcomers Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, photographed by the incomparable Pasqualino de Santis and dressed by Danilo Donati. It was shot on location in various parts of Italy, piecing together an authentic-looking period Verona. The film was a huge box-office hit \u2013 especially with young audiences not normally attracted to Shakespeare \u2013 and finally solved Zeffirelli\u2019s financial worries, as he had a percentage of the profits. De Santis and Donati both won Oscars, and Zeffirelli was nominated for best director, but he was unable to attend the ceremony because he had been involved in a car crash when Gina Lollobrigida was driving him to a football match. He suffered severe head injuries and though he was to have facial surgery which more or less restored his appearance, close friends believed that the accident was to blame for his subsequent erratic behaviour. Certainly it prompted a bout ofreligious zeal, as he believed that a miracle had saved him. He dedicated himself to religious films such as Brother Sun, Sister Moon (1972), about Saint Francis of Assisi, and the very popular TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth (1977), with Robert Powell, which he considered to be a God-sent mission. He also became the regular metteur en sc\u00e8ne of important Vatican events. His remake of The Champ (1979), starring Ricky Schroder, proved to be a box office hit. It was pure schmaltz, but the young star and a manipulative screenplay ensured its success. He tried for another hit, reworking Romeo and Juliet as Endless Love (1981), but it was only modestly popular, marking his last foray into the youth market. Zeffirelli then concentrated on a cycle of films of operas. In La Traviata (1982), he made effective use of the flashback device that had not been appreciated at his 1964 Scala production. His 1986 film of Otello was perhaps underrated. However, the Italian musical world would never forgive him for his fanciful film The Young Toscanini (1988). In 1990, he had a popular success with a concise movie version of Hamlet, with Mel Gibson in the lead role. Gibson made a creditable stab at the character, but it did not have the powerful impact of Zeffirelli\u2019s Italian stage production. At home and abroad, he had always loved to work with the biggest stars. In the 80s, he directed two of the Italian theatre\u2019s most adored leading ladies, Valentina Cortese and Rossella Falk, in Schiller\u2019s Mary Stuart. In the mid-90s he made his debut at the Arena of Verona with the most sumptuous Carmen ever staged, even in that home of grandiosity, with 28 Spanish dancers in the ballet. The crowds were ecstatic and it has been revived regularly. A \u201csemi-staged\u201d and star-studded one-off production in 2000 at the Rome Opera House marked the centenary of the first performance there of Puccini\u2019s Tosca, with triumphs for Luciano Pavarotti as Mario and In\u00e9s Salazar as Tosca. Zeffirelli won unanimous praise for the simplicity of the staging on a central rostrum, with the orchestra seated in a semi-circle around it. For a director sometimes criticised for over-sumptuous productions, it was an example of professional acumen for an event that necessitated economy but also dignified execution. Having failed to get elected to the city council of Florence in the 1980s, Zeffirelli seized on the chance offered by Silvio Berlusconi to stand for the senate in a safe seat in Sicily in the 1994 general elections. Two years later he was re-elected, and served until 2001. Berlusconi\u2019s company Medusa then co-produced the film about Callas that Zeffirelli had been wanting to make for many years. Callas Forever (2002), starring Fanny Ardant, was more a homage than a biopic. It was difficult to be convinced by the imaginary story of her sad last months in Paris, where a gay impresario (played by Jeremy Irons, interpreted by some reviewers as a Zeffirelli figure) convinces the star that modern technology would make it possible for her to do a film of Carmen, redubbing her voice from better days. In 2001, at the pocket-sized Teatro Verdi in Busseto, he staged an exquisitely tasteful production of Aida, an opera that he had always staged so opulently on larger stages. It was revived in 2003 and toured on larger stages, but still in minimalist form, winning praise all round. It made up for his less-appreciated return to another of his warhorses, La Traviata, also in Busseto, staged around a Plexiglas cube. In 2003 he directed Plowright in Absolutely! (Perhaps), from Pirandello\u2019s Cos\u00ec \u00c8 (Se Vi Pare), at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London. His lavish opera sets and designs distinguished his 2006 production of Aida at La Scala, billed by Zeffirelli himself as \u201cthe sum of all the others \u2013 the Aida of Aidas\u201d, but it was also notable for a gala performance that included a clamorous exit during the first act by Roberto Alagna who, after singing Celeste Aida, had been booed by half of the audience. Throughout his 80s, Zeffirelli\u2019s operatic productions continued to be staged at the Teatro dell\u2019Opera in Rome and the Arena in Verona. In 2004, he received an honorary knighthood from Britain, having two years earlier finally received the lifetime achievement prize at the David di Donatello awards (the Italian Oscars). It was his first really significant accolade from the Italian cinema world, which he felt had never recognised him as an \u201cauteur\u201d. It was a pity, because outside the social whirl, Zeffirelli had endearing personal charisma and generosity, and he was gifted with a creative flair in the tradition of the great Renaissance craftsmen. In 2013 he was given Florence\u2019s highest honour, the Fiorino d\u2019Oro, or golden florin, and bequeathed his archives to the city. He is survived by the adult sons he adopted in 2000, Pippo and Luciano. \u2022 Gianfranco Corsi Zeffirelli, opera, theatre and film director, born 12 February 1923; died 15 June 2019 \u2022 John Francis Lane died in 2018",

They have great players who can take the game away so quickly. It\u2019s tough, you want to hit the top of the off-stump but when they are hitting balls off there you have to change up and we didn\u2019t quickly enough early. It was nice for Maxwell to have that long boundary. It was tough with the short boundary at Taunton; players back themselves to take him on. So it was nice here being able to bowl properly, having that real estate. In each game we have improved in the middle overs. The way we dragged it back was really impressive. Then Starcy, as soon as he gets a sniff of a new batsman he is all over them. The next game we have is a Trent Bridge so we have to assess if we can get ten overs out of a part-time option otherwise you have to go with an all-round option to bowl with Maxwell. We have played some really good cricket in patches but with plenty of room to improve, which is a positive.\u201d <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d0527898f08263b930f03bb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-15T17:17:10.635Z\">6.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Dimuth Karunaratne speaks. </strong>\u201cIt is a pretty good wicket.

They are class bowlers but we\u2019ve played against them for a long time and know what they\u2019re going to do. We need to keep a plan with what to do in those periods. That\u2019s what is missing.

How? The usual way in a World Cup fixture: Mitch Starc. After knocking over Kusal Perera (52), the run rate slumped for Sri Lanka after their rapid 87-0 start in the first ten overs. All four of Australia\u2019s quicks battled to begin but fought back well to share the ten wickets between them. Maxwell, the fifth bowler, was excellent as well getting through his ten overs giving up just 46 runs. Aaron Finch will be very happy with that, especially given they don\u2019t have access to Marcus Stoinis at the moment. Down to the post-game presentations.

Richardson bowls a wide then finds his line, Dhananjaya\u2019s scoop falling an inch short of Behrendorff.

Like a cyclist running out of puff riding uphill Australia just seemed unable to do anything to jolt themselves out of their growing slumber, one that accounted for the uncharacteristically somnolent Warner (26) and Khawaja (10). </p> <p>The introduction of Smith at the halfway mark with his side 100-2 proved the decisive moment of the innings. His energy at the crease rebooted Finch and together the pair plundered 173 in 20 overs to take the game away from Sri Lanka. Finch eventually perished for a magnificent 153 with his runs accumulated all round the wicket with all manner of craft and strength. If he has ever played better than today it must have been a fine innings to watch. Smith fell shortly afterwards for 73, the second of five dismissals in the closing eight overs as the wheels fell off somewhat for Australia.</p> <p>Glenn Maxwell survived the carnage to smash 46 from 25 balls but around him there was an absence of targeted slogging with Shaun Marsh\u2019s three from nine likely to draw plenty of ire.</p> <p>Sri Lanka deserve great credit for how they bowled late on. Udana and Malinga in particular executed their slower balls and yorkers to perfection and Udana\u2019s fielding off his own bowling to effect two run outs in an over was memorable.</p> <p>334 should be plenty for Australia with their attack but it is short of what they should have achieved after such a strong start and then that massive Finch-Smith partnership.

Then of course there is the rare hapax legomenon - words which appear only once in a era, community, text or oeuvre - Shakespeare only ever used \u2018satyr\u2019 once. There\u2019s about 400 hapax legomenons in the Hebrew Bible, and they get acsribed a fair bit of significance in that Hebrew Bible sort of way.\u201d We should OBO Countdown sometime. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d04c5e78f08374cc578e95b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-15T10:25:13.431Z\">11.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>12th over: Australia 63-0 (Warner 21, Finch 37) </strong>Better from Perera, including that very tight LBW appeal.

After suffering a hammering at the hands of a merciless New Zealand in their tournament opener Sri Lanka have endured the misfortune of consecutive washouts against Pakistan and Bangladesh, two opponents they would have fancied their chances against. Results are now required against four of the top five ranked teams in ODI cricket, starting with the defending champions.<br></p> <p>For Australia it\u2019s a welcome chance to tinker with their sub-optimal approach before the knockout phase. The good news for Justin Langer is his big names have delivered under pressure, notably David Warner with the bat and Mitchell Starc with the ball, but the drop off in standard from the stars to the role players has been alarming. Moreover, there still appears a lack of clarity in selection and strategy leading to Usman Khawaja hovering like a bad smell in the batting order and captain Aaron Finch pressganged into lobbing down some auxiliary overs. The best of their best has largely been good enough to paper over cracks so far but the form of the other likely semi-finalists suggests improvement across the board is required for a sixth Australian triumph since 1987.<br></p> <p>Start time is 10.30am local (7.30pm AET) which means there\u2019s plenty of time to chew the fat about all things CWC beforehand.

      "bodyText": "Here are the latest standings ... Barney Ronay\u2019s match report. That\u2019s all from from me at The Oval. Thanks for your company throughout the afternoon. I\u2019ll be with you again from Old Trafford tomorrow for the biggest game in the group stage: India vs Pakistan. Until then, have a lovely Saturday night. Bye! Aaron Finch speaks. \u201cI thought we were a touch short with the new ball. They have great players who can take the game away so quickly. It\u2019s tough, you want to hit the top of the off-stump but when they are hitting balls off there you have to change up and we didn\u2019t quickly enough early. It was nice for Maxwell to have that long boundary. It was tough with the short boundary at Taunton; players back themselves to take him on. So it was nice here being able to bowl properly, having that real estate. In each game we have improved in the middle overs. The way we dragged it back was really impressive. Then Starcy, as soon as he gets a sniff of a new batsman he is all over them. The next game we have is a Trent Bridge so we have to assess if we can get ten overs out of a part-time option otherwise you have to go with an all-round option to bowl with Maxwell. We have played some really good cricket in patches but with plenty of room to improve, which is a positive.\u201d Dimuth Karunaratne speaks. \u201cIt is a pretty good wicket. We thought there would be some seam movement but it was a good batting track. We bowled well in the first 25 overs but then Finch and Smith batted really well. We fought back strongly but it wasn\u2019t enough. We got a good start with myself and Kusal but we couldn\u2019t capitalise and keep the momentum on. They are class bowlers but we\u2019ve played against them for a long time and know what they\u2019re going to do. We need to keep a plan with what to do in those periods. That\u2019s what is missing. We\u2019ve lost a couple of matches due to the rain but we need to win a couple of matches against the big sides and if we can do that we can make the top four. We want to get into the semi-finals.\u201d Aaron Finch is player of the match. Talking about his 153, he paid a lot of credit to Steve Smith for helping him get through the gears in their big stand and Glenn Maxwell for his hitting leading into the death. We\u2019ll hear from him again in a moment when his captains\u2019 hat is on. It was a fantastic knock from the skipper. Australia did that well. From 115/0, Sri Lanka lost 10/132. How? The usual way in a World Cup fixture: Mitch Starc. After knocking over Kusal Perera (52), the run rate slumped for Sri Lanka after their rapid 87-0 start in the first ten overs. All four of Australia\u2019s quicks battled to begin but fought back well to share the ten wickets between them. Maxwell, the fifth bowler, was excellent as well getting through his ten overs giving up just 46 runs. Aaron Finch will be very happy with that, especially given they don\u2019t have access to Marcus Stoinis at the moment. Down to the post-game presentations. Back in a tick with Aaron Finch and co. Cummins (2/38) gets the tenth and that\u2019s the game! Pradeep backs away and gets an edge at last. Australia win, the two points taking them to the top of the ladder. 45th over: Sri Lanka 246-9 (Dhananjaya 15, Pradeep 0) Target 335 Thinking on my feet, this is the problem with using Net Run Rate as a tiebreak decider. You don\u2019t see this kind of trash cricket if, say, sixes struck (or something like that) split the teams. Anyway. Richardson bowls a wide then finds his line, Dhananjaya\u2019s scoop falling an inch short of Behrendorff. But they go upstairs to check it anyway, the TV umpire taking waaay too long to confirm what everyone knew after one replay: it\u2019s NOT OUT. He plays the very same trick shot from the next ball but clears Benrendorff\u2019s right hand on the edge of the circle for four. He gives Pradeep the strike for one ball after hacking into midwicket. Gross. Pradeep backs away again, swinging and missing. These are minutes of our lives we are never getting back. I know Matthew Engel hates NRR. Why would I disagree with him? 44th over: Sri Lanka 240-9 (Dhananjaya 10, Pradeep 0) Target 335 Gosh, make it stop. Dhananjaya repeats the pattern of the previous over, denying Cummins a crack at Pradeep until the penultimate ball of the over. The No11 backs away so far that he can\u2019t reach a ball that misses off stump by a coat of varnish, repeating that in response to the final ball, sailing over middle stump by about six inches. Yuk. 43rd over: Sri Lanka 238-9 (Dhananjaya 9, Pradeep 0) Target 335 For what little it matters to Net Run Rate in the unlikely event that they can bat out the overs, Dhananjaya is protecting Pradeep from the strike when picking out sweepers. He gets one chance at the No11 to finish the game (and his spell with a fifth wicket but it isn\u2019t to be), but the delivery is steered to third man. They elect not to take the single so that Dhananjaya keeps the strike. Grim cricket. He finishes with 4/55. 42nd over: Sri Lanka 237-9 (Dhananjaya 8, Pradeep 0) Target 335 Pradeep keeps out two Richardson yorkers, extending the game by an over. They have lost 6/32. Richardson gets himself a third. Malinga, wanting nothing to do with the pace, spoons the easiest of chances to Khawaja at cover. Start the car. 41st over: Sri Lanka 237-8 (Dhananjaya 8, Malinga 1) Target 335 I neglected to mention in the previous Starc over that he was actually on a hat-trick. He\u2019s in here now looking for a fifth, attacking the stumps of Dhananjaya who is just able to keep out the yorkers and low full tosses. Not to be, but he has one to come. Brendon McCullum makes a very good point on the TV commentary: why didn\u2019t they go after Glenn Maxwell, Australia\u2019s fifth bowler, when they were going so nicely earlier in the innings? It\u2019s as though they got to ten overs and put the anchor down. It made no sense at the time and even less now that the chase is in ruins. \u201cTypically shabby Australian spoil-sportery denying a much-needed underdog victory,\u201d says a frustrated Brian Withington. \u201cFor a team supposedly not exactly firing on full cylinders, it\u2019s looking rather ominous for the opposition if they ever get their act together.\u201d Something like that. I didn\u2019t agree with this view until today but I nearly do now. Richardson ends his over with a short ball that Udana tries to smack back over his head with the horizontal bat, but he isn\u2019t getting it over Aaron Finch running backwards with the flight from mid-off to take the straightforward chance over his head. The Australian captain throws a smiling thumbs up to his fans in the OSC Stand after taking the chance. Sri Lanka are floudering and Australia know it. 40th over: Sri Lanka 236-8 (Dhananjaya 8) Target 335 39th over: Sri Lanka 229-7 (Dhananjaya 8, Udana 2) Target 335 Dhananjaya ends the successful Starc over with a delightful drive down the ground for four. With Mendis\u2019 wicket goes any realistic hope for Sri Lanka, edging a ball angled across him that he was trying to whack into the legside. Starc has four, making 13 for the World Cup. What an amazing record he has in these tournaments. 38th over: Sri Lanka 222-6 (Mendis 30, Dhananjaya 3) Target 335 Dhanahjaya de Silva is the new man, who can do plenty of damage with the blade, as Australia well know. Behrendorff is turned to by Finch, once again using the fall of A wickets to swing a change and squeeze out a frugal over. It works: five from it. Huge, huge, huge game tomorrow. I\u2019m off to Manchester tonight. Can\u2019t wait. Six and out! First ball at the crease, Perera makes good enough contact to clear the rope at fine leg. But two balls later, trying to smash him over mid-on, he fails to clear Warner on the 30m circle, who takes a good catch moving to his right. That makes two in the over for Starc, leaving Sri Lanka in serious trouble. 37th over: Sri Lanka 217-6 (Mendis 28) Target 335 Starc hits the stumps once again! How often do we see it? To the new man, the left-handed Siriwardana, Starc angles in at pace and hits leg stump, the ball finding the woodward via his back pad. They\u2019re in for the kill now. 36th over: Sri Lanka 208-4 (Mendis 27, Siriwardana 3) Target 335 Siriwardana is off the mark with a couple to midwicket to get off the mark, ending Cummins\u2019 first over back. An important one that saw the end of Angelo Mathews. Once again a Finch bowling change brings a big reward. Mathews out hooking! Back into the attack, Cummins\u2019 bumper isn\u2019t online but the shot is no good, helped into the waiting hands of Carey. Just as it was the last time Mendis hit a straight six, it has been followed the next over by his partner getting out caught behind. Sri Lanka are wobbling. They need a hero. 35th over: Sri Lanka 204-3 (Mendis 26, Mathews 9) Target 335 Starc is back and MENDIS LOVES IT! What a shot to begin, stepping into a full ball and smashing him back over his head for SIX! After taking ownership early in the over, Mathews does the same to finish with a powerful pull into the gap behind squre for four. 11 off it all up. Could this be the start of something? Sri Lanka still need 8.8 an over. 34th over: Sri Lanka 193-3 (Mendis 19, Mathews 5) Target 335 Glenn Maxwell: 10-0-46-0. Can\u2019t ask for much more than that our of your fifth bowler; just the three singles from this final over. Clarke is discussing his progress in the national sides. \u201cI don\u2019t think he and Steve Smith saw eye to eye when he was captain.\u201d Meanwhile at the other game, Afghanistan are continuing to collapse. 33rd over: Sri Lanka 190-3 (Mendis 17, Mathews 4) Target 335 Karunaratne departs with Sri Lanka now needing 8.35 an over to win. After such a brisk start, he fell on 97 from 108 balls, sorted out after a period where Australia slowed the game down nicely. He will have to wait for his maiden ODI ton. Angelo Mathews is the new man to the middle and is away first ball with a lovely on-driven four! As you do. But Richardson uses the short ball well, twice bumping the new man with accurate bouncers and squeezing out four dots to end his successful over. I Am Australian is playing over here between overs. Such a powerful and inclusive song during in the 1990s, it would be written off as virtue signalling nowadays. Karunaratne has gifted Maxwell the easiest of chances in the gully! The cut was probably on but he got too cute, paying the price just three runs short of what would have been a wonderful World Cup ton. 32nd over: Sri Lanka 186-2 (Karunaratne 97, Mendis 17) Target 335 That\u2019s one way! What is looking like another limp over for the chasing side - 17 runs from the previous 4.5 overs - ends with a BIG SIX over Maxwell\u2019s head! The Sri Lankan gun was down the track waiting for the off-break, getting to the pitch and nailing it. 31st over: Sri Lanka 178-2 (Karunaratne 96, Mendis 10) Target 335 There is a lot to like about Richardson, such a resilient cricketer. Justin Langer said that a year ago he didn\u2019t think the South Australian had the \u201cbottle\u201d for international cricket. Now, he\u2019s being turned to at a clutch time. Four dots and two singles make it a very good over, Mendis not far away from gifting his wicket with a miscued hook. The squeeze is on and Sri Lanka need to find a way out of it. 30th over: Sri Lanka 176-2 (Karunaratne 95, Mendis 9) Target 335 Clever bowling from Maxwell, cramping up both batsmen by attacking the stumps. Finch is throwing it around, milking overs out in spells of two or three overs. 20 overs remain and Sri Lanka need just on eight an over to pull off a massive win. 29th over: Sri Lanka 173-2 (Karunaratne 93, Mendis 8) Target 335 Richardson has to follow the example of Behrendorff, the other seamer who took some tap from the opening pair during the opening power play. He\u2019ll be happy with this re-start, five runs taken but no boundary balls. Karunaratne is into the 90s. Mark Nicholas and Michael Clarke note that Australia also went through a quiet period in their innings and that\u2019s true. They were 110 at the halfway mark, for what it\u2019s worth. 28th over: Sri Lanka 168-2 (Karunaratne 89, Mendis 7) Target 335 Behrendorff has done his job in this his second spell, yet to give up a boundary and collecting the wicket of Thirimanne. Karunaratne is trying to lift the tempo against him but there is nothing there for it, missing a pre-meditated hoick to the legside. The rate required is most of of the way to eight an over now. Meanwhile, Afghanistan are in strife at Cardiff, South Africa taking a fifth wicket. 27th over: Sri Lanka 159-2 (Karunaratne 83, Mendis 4) Target 335 Just 24 from the last five overs as these two work their way into it, Cummins through his fifth with four singles taken to the fielders at fine leg and third man. He won\u2019t mind that. Kumar Sangakkara notes that Sri Lanka are 40 runs ahead of where Australia were at the same stage of the innings but it doesn\u2019t quite feel like that right now. \u201cSpeaking as a disinterested England supporter,\u201d emails Brian Withington, \u201can improbable Sri Lanka win today and Pakistan squeaking a thriller tomorrow would be simply marvellous for the dynamic of the tournament. Just saying.\u201d Agreed. A couple of underdog wins would do a lot of good in terms of setting up a scrap in the final week of round-robin games. This a potential downside of a long group stage, of course - dead rubbers (see 1996). But we\u2019re not there yet. 26th over: Sri Lanka 159-2 (Karunaratne 83, Mendis 4) Target 335 Karunaratne is playing like a man who knows he needs to make this a very big ton, happy to defend with patience after a few singles are taken from Behrendorff. If he throws it away this game will change in an instant. A tough balance to strike in a big chase. 25th over: Sri Lanka 156-2 (Karunaratne 82, Mendis 2) Target 335 Fairly handy time for Finch to bring Cummins back, who only bowled three overs earlier today. He sends one down the legside to Mendis but other than that, keeps him honest with an set full of dots banged in short of a length at genuine pace. \u201cYou can\u2019t be a cricket fan and not like statistics,\u201d writes Simon McMahon in reference to Kusal Perera\u2019s 153 and calculations that had it dubbed the best ever. \u201cMy favourite definition of the appeal of the cricket actually came from a previous OBO and is along the lines of \u2018basically all day drinking, with statistics\u2019, which is right up there alongside \u2018organised loafing\u2019. The fact that half of all statistics are made up, and the other 60% just inaccurate, is neither here nor there.\u201d 24th over: Sri Lanka 154-2 (Karunaratne 82, Mendis 1) Target 335 Kusal Mendis is a name that prompts respect (and probably fear) in the Australian camp after his heroics three years ago. He\u2019s off the mark with one to backward square first ball, completing Behrendorff\u2019s successful over; Thirimanne his first World Cup scalp. How disappointing for Sri Lanka. After copping a whack to the arm then responding with a lavish boundary through point, Thirimanne tries to play a glide from way too close to his body, edging to Carey who pouches an easy chance. 23rd over: Sri Lanka 145-1 (Karunaratne 81, Thirimanne 10) Target 335 Maxwell finds the inside edge of Karunaratne to begin, which could easily have been the end of his day. Not to be. But again, with only four runs taken, the degree of difficulty is slowly rising up for Sri Lanka. Maxwell only has three more to bowl. \u201cI wonder if there is a sport anywhere where the standards have improved so dramatically over the past decade?\u201d asks Gideon Cleary. \u201cI\u2019m talking about the fielding, across every team, the catching them tossing up because you were crossing over the rope was a once a season happening, now it\u2019s every power-play. I watch cricket in London Fields and the only thing that stops a cover drive is either a pedigree toy dog or if it hits the bag that said dog is carried around in.\u201d Today not the best for a few tins in London Fields (too cold), but also something I also enjoy doing when the sun is shining. To your actual point: I completely agree. T20 has brought plenty to our sport. Something, something, Hundred, something. 22nd over: Sri Lanka 141-1 (Karunaratne 79, Thirimanne 8) Target 335 This is just tilting back Australia\u2019s way. Behrendorff has found his range after being roughed up a bit earlier, two singles to the sweepers on the off side the only runs on offer here. The last five overs have brought 20 runs, the required rate now above seven. \u201cI know Australia are going to win this game and go top,\u201d begins Andy Bradshaw, frustratedly, I assume. \u201cBut their batting has to be a real worry. 335 after that start is pretty disappointing and a better team than Sri Lanka should be able to chase it down, unless Starc has a special day.\u201d Debatable. Nothing wrong with 335. And sure, they should have got to 350. Did you see the death bowling, though? It was quite outstanding. Important to note. 21st over: Sri Lanka 139-1 (Karunaratne 78, Thirimanne 7) Target 335 Finch may as well bowl Maxwell out here, zipping through his sixth set with just four singles taken. He\u2019s bowled six overs now for 28 runs. Perfectly acceptable. 20th over: Sri Lanka 135-1 (Karunaratne 76, Thirimanne 5) Target 335 Good from Finch to get Behrendorff back while this new partnership builds having copped some serious tap from his second and third overs during the opening power play when Perera and Karunaratne were carving it up. Four off this with three dots can only help his confidence. He has to give his captain six more dependable overs. \u201cDammit,\u201d emails Jonathan Salisbury, for mozzing Perera moments before he fell. The commentator curse works on the OBO as well. On this, I stitched up Aaron Finch a beauty on radio earlier, rattling off all the player he was about to overtake just as he was dismissed. I\u2019ve burned Mitch Marsh DOZENS of times like this. 19th over: Sri Lanka 131-1 (Karunaratne 73, Thirimanne 4) Target 335 Maxwell is into his fifth over now, which is good news for Aaron Finch. He\u2019s keeping them relatively quiet, happy to pluck off singles. Oh, that\u2019s until the final delivery when he gives just enough width to Karunaratne, who uses it to steer the off-spinner down to the third man rope. Sri Lanka require 6.58 an over from here. 18th over: Sri Lanka 123-1 (Karunaratne 67, Thirimanne 2) Target 335 Very good captaincy from Finch to get his main man Starc back on after Maxwell slowed the run rate somewhat. He\u2019s sticking with him here after drinks Karunaratne, playing him carefully then nearly running himself out! Khawaja had to run him out there! Racing in from midwicket, the Aussie No3 had plenty of time to collect and underarm from about eight minutes but he\u2019s missed. Michael Clarke notes the medical tape on Khawaja\u2019s hand and says that \u201cso many players\u201d in the Australian team have it on their fingers. \u201cIt makes such a difference when trying to throw.\u201d 17th over: Sri Lanka 122-1 (Karunaratne 66, Thirimanne 2) Target 335 Top over from Maxwell to take Australia to drinks in better shape, just two singles given as the new man Thirimanne finds his feet. 16th over: Sri Lanka 120-1 (Karunaratne 65, Thirimanne 1) Target 335 As usual, there is confusion when Thirimanne/Thirimanna is batting, his name appearing both ways depending on where you wish to look. He\u2019s off the mark first ball with a glance, Karunaratne then finishing the successful Starc over with four off through about second slip. It\u2019s not quite on purpose but it does the job. I\u2019m moving inside at drinks - it\u2019s very cold all of a sudden. Starc as his best. It takes only three balls to send down his most dangerous delivery, swinging a full ball through the gate of Perera who was trying to pop him over midwicket. Lovely delivery; not the best shot. At last, Australia has one. 15th over: Sri Lanka 112-0 (Karunaratne 58, K Perera 52) Target 335 With such a great start, this pair can now build the innings without any further risks for the time being. Six taken here from Maxwell, all along the carpet. Very good batting. \u201cHi Adam.\u201d Hi Jonathan Salisbury. \u201cBy the time you get this he\u2019ll probably be out but has anyone mentioned his 153* in the Test at Durban. The definition of \u2018in the zone\u2019, and maybe here?\u201d Not wrong. Yes, in case this passed anyone in the cricket world by, earlier this year Perera did play the innings that one mathmetician adjudged the best of all time. 14th over: Sri Lanka 106-0 (Karunaratne 54, K Perera 50) Target 335 Starc is back to replace Kane Richardson from the Vauxhall End, giving up four singles to the sweepers, the last of those a yorker that Perera does well to dig out... moving his half-century in the process! He\u2019s faced just 33 balls to get there. \u201cSri Lanka couldn\u2019t have wished for a better start,\u201d observes Mark Nicholas on telly. 13th over: Sri Lanka 102-0 (Karunaratne 52, K Perera 48) Target 335 The 100 is up and the fans are very much up and about again! They are lucky to progress without losing their captain, who is pinned on the back pad by Maxwell but because they have blown their review they can\u2019t do anything about it after Richard Illingworth says no. The TV confirms that the decision would have been overturned. Oh dear. Needless to say, this isn\u2019t dwelled on by the TV commentary (G\u2019day, Mikey Holding, if you\u2019re reading). Brian Withington is straight into my inbox on that point. \u201cWhere\u2019s Michael Holding when you need an umpiring decision dissected in the commentary box?\u201d [Jim Maxwell] Hmmmmmmmmmmmm. [/Jim Maxwell] 12th over: Sri Lanka 98-0 (Karunaratne 50, K Perera 46) Target 335 The captain moves to his half-century from 45 balls with his seventh boundary, creaming Richardson through midwicket. Looking to my right, there are quite a few neutral fans in today by the looks and they are ALL on their feet and ALL with Sri Lanka. Great stuff. This is what a World Cup is all about: loud and brilliant. \u201cDon\u2019t know about moving north from the Oval,\u201d writes Peter Rowntree. \u201cTook a squint at the weather forecast for Arundel the other night, because of the Sussex v Gloucestershire game, and unbelievably the weather forecast looks good for about a week. Lovely setting for cricket as well.\u201d Was always going to be so. 11th over: Sri Lanka 91-0 (Karunaratne 46, K Perera 43) Target 335 With the field out - four men permitted outside the circle until the end of the 40th - Maxwell is brought straight on by Finch. His overs are very important for Finch now without another all-rounder - he has to do the job. It\u2019s a very good start from him too, sending one down leg but other than that, ripping his accurate off-breaks, keeping them quiet after such a powerful end to the power play. 10th over: Sri Lanka 87-0 (Karunaratne 44, K Perera 42) Target 335 Before the appeal, Perera had the pro Sri Lankan crowd on their feet once more when pulling a ball across the line to the midwicket boundary. Have that! Richardson isn\u2019t quite quick enough to drop short unless it is right at the badge of the helmet. 87 from the power play. The perfect way to take on a big chase. They\u2019re a big shout now. NOT OUT! The technology - ultraedge - shows nothing. Australia lose their review! HAS RICHARDSON FOUND PERERA\u2019S OUTSIDE EDGE? Umpire Dar says no, Finch says yes. The latter sends it upstairs to find out for sure. Stand by. 9th over: Sri Lanka 79-0 (Karunaratne 43, K Perera 35) Target 335 This is getting a bit out of hand for Australia now; they need to break this stand up ASAP. 18 from the Behrendorff over! Perera hits a superb shot over cover to begin that goes all the way for SIX! That\u2019s the shorter side of the ground today and the wind is blowing in that direction so that\u2019s clever batting with the field up. Finch gives up the next boundary, taking a ping at Perera\u2019s stumps but with nobody backing up four overthrows help the Sri Lankan cause. To finish, Perera is at it again with a little tuck that beats short fine man for four more! After a great start, Behrendorff is really battling now. One more over in this power play, they have to keep going! 8th over: Sri Lanka 61-0 (Karunaratne 42, K Perera 18) Target 335 When talking to Kane Richardson after his World Cup debut on Thursday he wasn\u2019t sure if he would get enough chance, but with Coulter-Nile sore he\u2019s very much an important cog in the Australian machine today. There is a fair bit going on in the over too, which includes another Karunaratne tuck for four - he can\u2019t bowl there with fine leg up. The captain, not known for his lavish strokeplay, is already 42 from 34! 7th over: Sri Lanka 53-0 (Karunaratne 37, K Perera 15) Target 335 I tell you what, Sri Lanka aren\u2019t mucking around here. After taking a look at Behrendorff\u2019s first over and feeling their way through it unsuccessfully, they collect 13 this time to keep the good times rolling. Rotating the strike early in the over, Karunaratne safely hooks a bumper away for four then - in a repeat of the previous set - inside edges the next to the rope as well! He keeps the strike with a clip and the Sri Lankan fans are making a LOT of noise. Don\u2019t forget, this is where they chased down a decent Indian tally in 2017 Champions Trophy - three wickets down. \u201cSettling in for the evening here, Cricket and Crierium du Dauphin\u00e9,\u201d emails Damien McLean. \u201cI think Australia has done enough but Sri Lanka would like to make a statement even if they don\u2019t make the semi-finals. Disappointing once again from the middle order after a great start from the top. I\u2019m not the biggest Shaun Marsh fan, even though I know he has seemed at his best in ODI\u2019s of late, but replacing Marcus Stoinis? I don\u2019t think so... Cover for the top order, where you have time to get yourself in, I get that. Not at 6 though. Thoughts? Who could be a better inclusion? Maybe Mitchell Marsh if they take Stoinis out of the squad? Shuffle Warner to 6, Khawaja to open and SMarsh to first drop? I doesn\u2019t seem to be sitting right at the moment anyhow. Thanks for your work.\u201d I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll keep Marsh and Khawaja in the same XI. Today, sure. No big deal. Against England, they won\u2019t run the gauntlet with four quicks plus Maxwell. Oh, and sorry about the score misprint a couple of overs ago. The good thing about the OBO is that I\u2019ve already edited the post, so it never actually happened. 6th over: Sri Lanka 40-0 (Karunaratne 25, K Perera 14) Target 335 Pat Cummins has by far the most dot balls in the tournament so far (159 of them before today, Archer in second place about 30 or so behind) but he\u2019s going around a little bit today to begin. Karunaratne does as Perera did from this end a couple of overs ago, pulling a short ball away to the rope with real authority. Shot. A top ball in response from Cummins, jagging back and collecting an inside edge, but it misses the stumps and runs away for four more. Cummins changes up to go around the wicket, Karunaratne keeping the strike with deflecting one to third man. 5th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (Karunaratne 16, K Perera 14) Target 335 Behrendorff starts his World Cup career with an excellent over from the Pavilion End. His left arm pace has been so effective in white-ball cricket for WA over many years, between various injuries. He twice beats the bat of Karunaratne and is also up for a leg before shout when going beyond his inside edge. The maiden is spoiled by Sri Lanka\u2019s skipper from the final ball, clipping one. Still, a lovely set to begin. \u201cAfternoon Adam.\u201d Hello Brian Withington. \u201cThe Sri Lankan openers appear determined not to die wondering. In passing, how can this possibly be the last use of the Oval in the tournament - surely some mistake?\u201d I\u2019m afraid this is correct. Just how the tournament was set up, moving from venue to venue after a clump of games. This is the fifth fixture here, it is worth remembering. We move north of the river to Lord\u2019s the week after next. 4th over: Sri Lanka 30-0 (Karunaratne 15, K Perera 14) Target 335 Cummins is back to his happy place as the artificial light completely takes over. It\u2019s very, very dark. Perera picks out the fielders on the off side a couple of times before getting down the other end via an inside edge. Karunaratne\u2019s turn, who is beaten outside the off stump when missing a cut shot, more convincing to finish with three off the front foot to cover. A tiny bit of rain falls at the end of the over as well. Surely not... 3rd over: Sri Lanka 26-0 (Karunaratne 12, K Perera 13) Target 335 Starc reverts to the toes and helmet approach after Karunaratne takes another couple from a length ball, this time to point. The yorker he sends down hits the radar at 90mph, nearly flooring the captain, then cramping him with a short one to finish. Better. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 24-0 (Karunaratne 10, K Perera 13) Target 335 This is a superb start! \u201cA statement is being made early,\u201d says Mel Jones on TV and she\u2019s spot on, Karunaratne tucking three to square, Perera smashing four to midwicket then slapping again for four more! Stand and deliver stuff, all off the front foot. 1st over: Sri Lanka 12-0 (Karunaratne 7, K Perera 4) Target 335 The skipper is off the mark first up with one to third man, albeit off the outside edge. Starc pulls out of his approach from the next ball before giving Perera enough width to cut a boundary to get his own afternoon underway. It was uppish but there is nobody at point. \u201cI like the tempo of this stroke,\u201d says Kumar Sangakkara on TV. I spoke to the Sri Lankan great on the radio call earlier today and it is fair to say he isn\u2019t a fan of the current domestic set up in his homeland. Back to Starc, who slips a quicker ball past Perera\u2019s inside edge, appealing for lbw, but it is denied with Finch also denying his quick a review. Karunaratne finishes with four of his own, timing a wonderfully timed punch off the back foot to the point rope. Excellent start. The players are on the field. Dimuth Karunaratne and Kusal Perera are opening for the Sri Lankans, Mitch Starc starting Australia off from the pavilion end. PLAY! Afternoon. Thanks, JP. 33 in the final five overs wasn\u2019t quite what Australia were hoping for after Finch, Smith and Maxwell toyed with the Sri Lankans for the ten overs prior, but they still will be satisfied with 334/7 having bee sent in at the toss. Some magnificent death bowling prevented a final surge, Udana especially classy. If Australia can defend this, it will move them to outright first on the table as we near the middle of the group stage. For Sri Lanka\u2019s part, chasing 335 down will move then into equal second (on points, not net run rate), would you believe. Looking forward to your company throughout the afternoon. I\u2019m coning to you from the front row of the outside press tributes in the OSC Stand. The Cricketeer Volunteers have just been paraded across the field with this being the final match at The Oval for the tournament. Too soon, I say. Let\u2019s talk throughout the chase. That was a peculiar old innings from Australia wasn\u2019t it? Finch and Warner looked in superb touch to begin with - the skipper in particular with his elegant drives within the V - before the introduction of de Silva slowed their momentum. Like a cyclist running out of puff riding uphill Australia just seemed unable to do anything to jolt themselves out of their growing slumber, one that accounted for the uncharacteristically somnolent Warner (26) and Khawaja (10). The introduction of Smith at the halfway mark with his side 100-2 proved the decisive moment of the innings. His energy at the crease rebooted Finch and together the pair plundered 173 in 20 overs to take the game away from Sri Lanka. Finch eventually perished for a magnificent 153 with his runs accumulated all round the wicket with all manner of craft and strength. If he has ever played better than today it must have been a fine innings to watch. Smith fell shortly afterwards for 73, the second of five dismissals in the closing eight overs as the wheels fell off somewhat for Australia. Glenn Maxwell survived the carnage to smash 46 from 25 balls but around him there was an absence of targeted slogging with Shaun Marsh\u2019s three from nine likely to draw plenty of ire. Sri Lanka deserve great credit for how they bowled late on. Udana and Malinga in particular executed their slower balls and yorkers to perfection and Udana\u2019s fielding off his own bowling to effect two run outs in an over was memorable. 334 should be plenty for Australia with their attack but it is short of what they should have achieved after such a strong start and then that massive Finch-Smith partnership. The questions that were asked of Australia\u2019s batting before this innings remain and there is work to do before the semi-finals. Find out if Sri Lanka can get themselves over the line and remain a going concern in this World Cup shortly with Adam Collins at the keys. I\u2019ll catch you again soon. Thanks for all your superb contributions. 50th over: Australia 334-7 (Maxwell 46, Starc 5) Perera to bowl the final over of the innings and it begins brilliantly with four singles and a two before Maxwell manipulates a boundary through midwicket from the final delivery. Weirdly, Sri Lanka will probably head to the interval the more upbeat of the two sides following that performance in the death overs. Still, Australia have more than enough runs to assure themselves of a semi-final berth. 49th over: Australia 324-7 (Maxwell 40, Starc 1) Superb death overs bowling from Udana and backed up by his own superb fielding. Not the conclusion to Australia\u2019s innings that they were looking for. Bad to worse for Australia. Another Udana yorker collected in his follow through but this time he throws down the striker\u2019s stumps and Cummins is out for a golden duck. The ball between that and the previous run out almost bagged a wicket too but the thick edge that spiraled off Maxwell\u2019s bat just cleared Angelo Mathews in the gully. Australia\u2019s late-innings collapse continues apace. Carey is the latest to go, run out brilliantly by Udana, the bowler gathering a superb yorker in his follow through, spinning and, on his knees, throwing down the non-striker\u2019s stumps. 48th over: Australia 317-5 (Maxwell 34, Carey 4) Another excellent death over by Malinga, seven from it, and it would have been tighter than that but for some questionable Sri Lankan fielding. Australia are going to post a total that is likely matchwinning, but again they have failed to address glaring issues with their batting. Terrific over by Udana, like Malinga before him landing a host of slower balls and yorkers to deny Australia any boundaries then jagging the wicket of a frustrated Marsh at the end of it, holding out to midwicket after labouring to just three runs from nine balls. 47th over: Australia 310-5 (Maxwell 31) Meanwhile, in other cricket news... 46th over: Australia 306-4 (Maxwell 29, Marsh 2) After the carnage of the previous over Sri Lanka will be overjoyed at Malinga\u2019s ability to concede just three singles and a leg-bye in a set full of yorkers and change-ups. 45th over: Australia 302-4 (Maxwell 27, Marsh 1) Oi oi! It\u2019s Maxy magic time! 22 from Pradeep\u2019s over. He begins short so Maxwell slaps it like a forehand smash wide of long on. The second is length and goes the journey over the bowler\u2019s head. The third is dug out for a dot but the fourth is whipped with immense bottom hand force for four through midwicket. Ball five is a full toss carted through cow corner and salt is rubbed into the wound with a top edged pull over the keeper four more. 44th over: Australia 280-4 (Maxwell 5, Marsh 1) Well, that was unexpected. A wicket and just five runs from that Malinga over. Australia\u2019s inability to put together a full 50 over innings is again coming back to haunt them. Bosh! Vintage Malinga. Perfectly executed yorker from around the wicket to Smith and even the very best struggle to play them. Two quick wickets to Sri Lanka and that may buy them some hope at the innings break. Excellent knock from Smith. Not only his 73 runs but his ability to play as Finch\u2019s foil and add some impetus to the innings following the lacklustre displays of Warner and Khawaja. 43rd over: Australia 275-3 (Smith 73, Maxwell 1) Well played skipper. A massive individual knock and with the good grace to allow us a few overs of Glenn Maxwell before the close. The fielding has been pretty ordinary. The bowling hasn\u2019t been that bad (in my opinion) especially during that middle phase led by de Silva. Like most sides in the modern era they lack an ability to force a breakthrough when a batting side takes control. No double century for Finch. He fails to pick an Udana slower ball and his mighty heave skews off the top edge and into the hands of Karunaratne at cover. Superb innings nonetheless featuring some exquisite timing, brutal hitting, and no shortage of patience as well. Top stuff. 42nd over: Australia 269-2 (Finch 152, Smith 69) Can Malinga stem the bleeding? No. Finch stands and delivers, muscling the ball through midwicket for four then Smith scythes a mighty blow across the line, sending the ball miles over cow corner accompanied by the sweetest \u201cclack\u201d you could wish to hear. That was pure ball striking. 41st over: Australia 255-2 (Finch 137, Smith 62) Smith may be the most awkward batsman in the world to bowl to once set. He ends up in such unfamiliar positions at the crease which allows him to work the ball to indefensible areas. Pradeep does nothing wrong at the start of his ninth over but a leg stump yorker ends up beating square-leg for four then length on off stump disappears to the third-man boundary. A single brings Finch on strike and with it creativity replaced by brute force. Poor Pradeep has nowhere to go as Finch wallops him over cover for a one bounce four then pulls him disdainfully for four more. 40th over: Australia 237-2 (Finch 137, Smith 53) Here we go! Finch has been winding up for a few overs now and he enters tee-off beast mode with a mighty heave across the line, depositing Perera into the stand behind square leg. He follows that up with a powerful cut for four. 39th over: Australia 224-2 (Finch 126, Smith 51) Pradeep\u2019s back for another dart but he\u2019s powerless to stop the insatiable Steve Smith from reaching his eighth 50 in ten World Cup matches. He might have been out of international cricket for a year but he hasn\u2019t missed a beat on his return. Impossible to bowl to and his intent has revitalised Australia\u2019s innings. 38th over: Australia 218-2 (Finch 122, Smith 49) This partnership is operating effectively at the moment. Smith is happy to rotate the strike and Finch is happy to smite boundaries, the latest a sledgehammer of a square drive. Remember when I asked if he could make 200+? In response to Stephen Barnes (35th over) the mysterious Yum has an answer. \u201cThe former is the most heinous possible for the bowling side which is obvious if a wicket falls. Further logic would say that a front foot no ball would rate fairly highly on the heinousness scale because it is in fact cheating, in the sense of being able to get the ball to the batter an inch faster.\u201d And so does Geoff Wignall: \u201cI guess the logic is that if the batsman knew at the time of delivery that a ball would be called wide he or she would leave it alone and avoid any risk of being caught, whereas with early warning of a no-ball they\u2019d throw everything at it without risk of dismissal.\u201d 37th over: Australia 210-2 (Finch 116, Smith 47) It\u2019s getting a little gloomy at the Oval. The lights are on and the wind\u2019s up. I wonder if we\u2019re in for a shower at some point? Udana enjoys the change in conditions, sending down a ball that makes the rare journey past the outside edge of Smith\u2019s bat but he can\u2019t complete the set to Finch, his final delivery ending up at the extra cover fence after the Aussie skipper was allowed enough room to free his arms. 36th over: Australia 203-2 (Finch 111, Smith 45) The second and final drinks break heralds what should be a 15-over thrash to the line for Australia. It begins promisingly for the defending champions with a thick edge from Smith sending Perera to the third-man fence for four. 35th over: Australia 194-2 (Finch 108, Smith 39) Australia\u2019s decision to attack is eased by Sri Lanka\u2019s to recall Udana. Finch has looked to attack the left-arm paceman all day and he cracks another drive through extra cover to keep momentum flowing his side\u2019s way. \u201cWhat is the logic of a free hit for a no ball but not for a wide?\u201d asks Stephen Barnes. \u201cSurely the latter is a more heinous crime? (Another sole buddy word pair, incidentally).\u201d 34th over: Australia 190-2 (Finch 104, Smith 39) Sri Lanka are under the pump a bit now so they turn to Perera whose heavy line and length helped wrestle back control earlier in the day. He does a decent job but this match is now all about Australia deciding when to launch for home. With Glenn Maxwell padded up they don\u2019t want to waste too many overs nudging ones and twos. 33rd over: Australia 183-2 (Finch 102, Smith 36) Siriwardana\u2019s second over instills little confidence he deserves a third. Finch\u2019s six to reach his ton was dismissive. After that session in the doldrums Australia are sailing along at a rate of knots again. Aaron Finch brings up his century with a clean strike over long-off for six. This has been an innings of three parts but deserving of three figures. Superb batting by the Australian skipper. 32nd over: Australia 176-2 (Finch 95, Smith 35) Malinga overpitches first ball of his sixth over and Finch presents the full face of his bat with enough encouragement to add four to his total. It\u2019s a messy over for Sri Lanka, containing a wide and a no-ball for failing to adhere to the Powerplay fielding restrictions. \u201cIs it not ridiculous that a wide ball is given when a ball goes down the leg side off a spinner?\u201d asks David Brown. \u201cThis ball is food and drink to a decent under 13 batsman but Australia are awarded a run and an extra ball when Finch fails to connect with a de Silva long hop.\u201d It remains, as it always has been, a batsman\u2019s game. 31st over: Australia 168-2 (Finch 94, Smith 30) Siriwardana is invited to bowl his left-arm spin but he has the misfortune of bowling to Smith with his eye in. His first delivery is worked away behind square for four and there\u2019s only one dot thereafter. 30th over: Australia 159-2 (Finch 93, Smith 22) Australia\u2019s counterpunch prompts the return of Malinga back into the attack and he delivers a boundaryless over, one full of those shots from Smith that look suicidal - stepping to off and uncovering his pegs - but end in easy ones and twos. Peter Salmon again: \u201cTo Paul Griffin - I am a copy-editor, and hate the hyphen too. Unfortunately it is still standard in most style guides, so I tend to use it, but the hyphen in general is slowly being excised from the English language, retained only in cases where there is a possible ambiguity, which I don\u2019t think there is in copy-editor. I\u2019ve unilaterally decided to get rid of all hyphens in \u2018-ly\u2019 words for instance, eg. newly-wed - the \u2018-ly\u2019 makes it obvious the second word is modified by the first. We can all make a small difference.\u201d 29th over: Australia 152-2 (Finch 91, Smith 18) Intent is such an interesting phenomenon in cricket. Australia began with lots of it then watched it ebb away, but since Steve Smith came out it\u2019s returned again. After upping the ante in previous minutes the big over arrives, Finch taking de Silva to task for 4,6,6, in a rare flurry of brute force. Quite why Australia allowed themselves to be so becalmed for that spell remains a mystery, especially when Finch shows such control with his hitting. 28th over: Australia 132-2 (Finch 73, Smith 17) Michaels Clarke and Slater are on commentary together. In the blink of an eye the subject turns to Bon Jovi. That chat is mercifully cut short by Smith\u2019s intent converting to four runs with a well-timed square drive. Udana is again the bowler to concede runs. 27th over: Australia 124-2 (Finch 71, Smith 11) Smith is starting to work through the gears, hustling and shuffling like a toddler ready for the loo. De Silva\u2019s accuracy restricts Australia to singles but there\u2019s a change of vibe out in the middle after that long spell of Sri Lankan control. 26th over: Australia 119-2 (Finch 69, Smith 9) Udana\u2019s back into the attack but he sends down the first over in an age that Australia find easy to score from, Smith in particular getting into line early and showing intent. The highlight is a whip to midwicket for four that he took from around off stump after stepping a mile to off to the left-arm over bowler. Paul Griffin\u2019s joined in: \u201cForgive the impertinent pedantry but are we sure that \u201ccopy-editor\u201d should be hyphenated? I\u2019m on Greek beach and have neglected to pack a style guide. This also explains the mauve swimwear, with which the locals remain unwowed (or possibly un-wowed?).\u201d 25th over: Australia 110-2 (Finch 67, Smith 2) Any thoughts of that mighty hit breaking the shackles are quickly dashed by de Silva\u2019s sixth over and his latest demonstration of control on a two-paced surface. \u201cI would just like to point out to Bill Pairman that not all dells are dingly. Some, at least, are bosky.\u201d Thanks Martin Wright. 24th over: Australia 108-2 (Finch 66, Smith 1) This is a splendid duel between Pradeep and Finch. The bowler has enjoyed the upper hand for a while now and again challenges Australia\u2019s skipper but the over ends with Finch pulling hard to a delivery outside the line of off stump that bounced grille-high. He connected superbly and the ball soared behind square leg for a much needed six. \u201cSplendid stuff from Peter Salmon,\u201d commends Brian Withington. \u201cI found myself wanting to see \u2018spittle\u2019 (partner, \u2018lick\u2019) amongst his list of fossil/binomial words but not sure if it qualifies? His reference to once in an era words had me segueing to the sort of (very) occasional bowler that you let loose just once in a competition, probably in the grand final when the chips are down, introduced ominously by the umpire as \u2018right arm, hapax legomenon\u2019.\u201d All that pressure has earned another wicket, and another for de Silva. Khawaja looked to break the shackles, slog-sweeping firmly but straight into the hands of the midwicket sweeper. 23rd over: Australia 100-2 (Finch 60, Smith 0) 22nd over: Australia 97-1 (Finch 56, Khawaja 10) Sri Lanka are now well on top of this passage of play and Pradeep is all over Australia, appealing unsuccessfully for an edge against Khawaja then whistling one through Finch\u2019s unconvincing pull before testing Khawaja\u2019s reflexes with a slippery lifter. 21st over: Australia 95-1 (Finch 55, Khawaja 9) Brendon McCullum on commentary has mentioned how the Oval can exhibit \u201cspongy\u201d bounce on occasion and it does appear that may be a factor in Australia\u2019s declining run-rate. Especially against spin the ball is just holding up or popping up, forcing the batsmen to check their drives and reconsider any abandon. \u201cI refer John Starbuck (over 17) to oxforddictionaries.com: In the phrase wrought havoc, as in they wrought havoc on the countryside, wrought is an archaic past tense of work and is not, as is sometimes assumed, a past tense of wreak.\u201d Thanks, Andy Killeen. 20th over: Australia 93-1 (Finch 54, Khawaja 8) Sensing an opportunity to strike Karunaratne recalls Pradeep and it so nearly does the trick. The opener begins his second spell by beating Khawaja\u2019s outside edge, then he finds a thick edge next ball before the normal service of tight lines and watchful batting resumes. Ok, so I\u2019ve been out of my depth with all this wordplay for a while, but this from Dom Cole might have tipped me into delirium. \u201cSurely it should be hapax legomena and not hapax legomenons. Though There are perhaps different criterions to support the other point of view.\u201d 19th over: Australia 87-1 (Finch 53, Khawaja 3) More of the same: decent bowling, conservative batting, and de Silva restricts Australia to four singles. My favourite OBO emailing homonym Matt Dony is around. \u201cCalling back to Ian Forth\u2019s musings on nouns that are followed by their adjective, I once \u2018enjoyed\u2019 a lively debate about \u2018Gins and tonic\u2019 vs \u2018Gin and tonics.\u2019 I guess it all comes down to how you treat the word \u2018tonic\u2019. If it is an abbreviation of \u2018Tonic water\u2019, then that\u2019s where the plural sits. But if it\u2019s being used in terms of its effect on the gin, that it acts as a tonic to the gin, then \u2018Gin\u2019 gets the S. Either way, it wroted havoc on the bar order.\u201d 18th over: Australia 83-1 (Finch 51, Khawaja 1) Aaron Finch shrugs off the loss of his opening partner to reach his third half-century of this World Cup. He looked superbly early on but has since been becalmed. Australia really have relinquished the impetus here. It may be decent bowling, it may be the pitch becoming a tad two-paced once the hardness of the new ball has disappeared, but there\u2019s a diminishing amount of intent on display at the crease. Brian Withington again: \u201cApparently \u2018havoc\u2019 is a military order permitting seizure of goods after victory, as in Mark Antony\u2019s call of \u2018Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war\u2019. A good rallying call in the dressing room before unleashing a pack of fast bowlers on a lively green top. By the way, I think Mark (Charles Jefford) Nicholas could just about pull off the Mr Darcy role in the commentary box.\u201d 17th over: Australia 80-1 (Finch 49, Khawaja 0) No messing around today, Khawaja is in at three. John Starbuck\u2019s returned, drawing a line from Richard I to Buffy, as you do. \u201c\u2018Time immemorial\u2019 is a well-established legal phrase, used to refer to English statute law dating from the reign of Richard I. This is an inaccurate credit to Richard, who didn\u2019t much care for England except as a money source for fighting wars, but leaves out his father Henry II who pulled together and created the foundations of our current legal set-up. Also, I don\u2019t much care for \u2018wreaked\u2019 as a past tense. It probably comes from American usage, who are notoriously poor at handling irregular verbs. An early episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer demonstrates this, with Anthony Head having to say \u2018slayed\u2019 should be used instead of \u2018slain\u2019; while it was in the script and he didn\u2019t have much choice, he should still be thoroughly ashamed.\u201d Sri Lanka have been tightening the tourniquet slowly over a number of overs and it finally pays dividends. Australia\u2019s openers have been content working ones and twos against some solid bowling but the moment Warner looks to improvise he\u2019s undone. Stepping back and across he gives himself room to cut de Silva but doesn\u2019t pick the quicker arm ball that skids through and sends the zing bails skywards. Excellent bowling from the spinner and a reward for a long spell of patient cricket from Sri Lanka. 16th over: Australia 79-0 (Warner 26, Finch 48) Another solid over from Perera and Sri Lanka. It\u2019s been a while since we saw a boundary. The bowlers are landing in good areas and the batters are respecting it. Tidy cricket. 15th over: Australia 76-0 (Warner 25, Finch 46) Time for spin with Dhananjaya de Silva brought on from the Vauxhall end and it\u2019s a promising start, especially to Warner with the right-arm bowler coming around the wicket and making a couple misbehave, forcing rare false shots. Nothing of great alarm for the batsmen, but in the context of their serene progress so far worth keeping a close eye on. David Farrelly must be tired or wired. \u201cIt is 4:15 ish am here in the Rockies so apologies if I lower the tenor of the conversation; but didn\u2019t Titus Andronicus invoke the gods to send down justice to wreak our wrongs? Or was that Shane Warne?\u201d I think Warnie was sent down to tweak our wrong\u2019uns wasn\u2019t he? Boom and indeed tish. Try the veal. 14th over: Australia 73-0 (Warner 24, Finch 44) Sri Lanka are enjoying a decent spell with Udana and Perera after Australia\u2019s confident start. Length has been key and Perera is again in the right areas, restricting Warner and Finch to a diet of singles. 13th over: Australia 69-0 (Warner 22, Finch 42) Udana continues his tidy spell. Nothing fancy going on, just consistent line and length keeping Australia honest. The grammar chat really has got you all interested, hasn\u2019t it? Back to Peter Salmon: \u201cBeing a copy-editor, I\u2019m enjoying the word chat as much as the cricket. What you\u2019ve got with \u2018wreak/havoc\u2019 is a binomial. \u2018Dingly\u2019 is a fossil word - one which only occurs in one context (often in a binomial) - other examples include bygones, champing, eke, fettle, fro, kith, petard, riddance, shebang, spick and yore - I won\u2019t supply the context. Then of course there is the rare hapax legomenon - words which appear only once in a era, community, text or oeuvre - Shakespeare only ever used \u2018satyr\u2019 once. There\u2019s about 400 hapax legomenons in the Hebrew Bible, and they get acsribed a fair bit of significance in that Hebrew Bible sort of way.\u201d We should OBO Countdown sometime. 12th over: Australia 63-0 (Warner 21, Finch 37) Better from Perera, including that very tight LBW appeal. An over of heavily bowled length deliveries that Australia are happy in the main to play from the crease with angled bats in search of ones and twos behind square. One of the joys of the OBO is unearthing the likes of Nick Cherkas. \u201cThe term is \u201ccollocation\u201d; words which are frequently found together. The example of \u201cwreak havoc\u201d is a strong collocation, as those words are, as we\u2019ve seen, good mates. Collocations are great fun and, for those learning English, arguably more important to be aware of than grammatical rules. They help in building vocabulary, as in \u201cslip fielder\u201d (a strong collocation) and \u201cmaiden over\u201d (a fairly strong collocation).\u201d It looked optimistic in real time but it was much closer than I expected on review. Perera struck Finch\u2019s front pad on the press forward and the ball was going on to hit the stumps but the batsman was saved by umpire\u2019s call for contact point outside the line of off stump. Perera calls for a review of an LBW shout against Finch that was declined onfield... 11th over: Australia 57-0 (Warner 20, Finch 35) Udana again does well, landing his left-arm over pace on a decent length around a testing fourth stump line. However, there is no indication Australia will lose a wicket any time soon. 10th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 17, Finch 34) It\u2019s a double change for Sri Lanka with Perera entering the attack but he is popgun to Finch on a surface this true. The Aussie skipper tucks in, hitting sweetly and with poise through the line of the ball to collect fours through the covers and point. I\u2019ve never seen Finch bat better than this. He could end with 200+. \u201cThinking of havoc and that mighty cricketing legend The Judge. I am put in mind not so much the havoc wrought by Robin Smith back in the day as the havoc wrought by that bloody Ray Illingworth, who if memory serves me correctly was the self styled supremo of English cricket who did so little for so many England players. I am thinking Tuffnell, Malcolm, Smith, Hick, Ramprakash; well all those who played during that era. Illingworth was such a self righteous known all, I think he managed to get the worst out of a lot of teams and players. He wroak a whole load of havoc.\u201d Gah! Thanks for the PTSD flashback Charlie Jeffery. 9th over: Australia 44-0 (Warner 16, Finch 26) Udana has recovered well enough from his early injury to join the attack and he begins smartly, restricting Australia\u2019s openers to just a single. Brian Withington is in the building. \u201cIan Forth\u2019s splendid literary references to Isa Guha had me wandering further back and idly picturing a Pride and Prejudice mash up in the commentary box, with Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy exchanging zingers during the high tea interval. Expertly acerbic analysis laced with smoulderingly repressed sexual tension - what\u2019s not to like?\u201d I can picture it now... Darcy: \u201cShe is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me - outside off stump.\u201d 8th over: Australia 43-0 (Warner 15, Finch 26) Australia are turning the screw here, presenting the full face of the bat to every delivery, selecting their shots well, and playing with that puffed out chest masculinity that so intimidates opponents. Warner converts that equation into four runs off Pradeep\u2019s first delivery, crunching it square, then he and Finch rotate the strike with ease. Finch does so holding every shot long after the ball has entered the fielding side\u2019s purview in another intimidatory display of body language. Back to words with - and without - friends... \u201cImmemorial prefers to hang out with \u2018time\u2019 in the vocabulary playground,\u201d offers Ian Forth, \u201cbut also allows us to pivot to adjectives that come after their nouns. See also \u2018court martial\u2019, \u2018poet laureate\u2019 and \u2018attorney general\u2019. A lesser man than me would make a cheap joke about David Warner and \u2018something fishy\u2019 but fortunately I\u2019m better than that.\u201d \u201cI would like to point out that I am pretty sure that the past tense of \u201cwreak havoc\u201d is surely \u201cwreaked havoc\u201d ! As in Botham wreaked havoc against Australia in 1981.\u201d Thanks Ralph Jennings (but don\u2019t forget Bob). 7th over: Australia 33-0 (Warner 8, Finch 25) Yet another sumptuous straight drive for four from Finch who is timing the ball gloriously this morning. Malinga responds by moving around the wicket in an effort to force the Australian skipper to play outside his V. Finch declines the offer, drilling another four straight through mid-off who - to misquote an old World Cup goals video I once had - was as much use as a lace curtain interrupting the path of a bullet. 6th over: Australia 23-0 (Warner 8, Finch 15) Better from Pradeep who lands an over on a tight line and length to keep Australia honest. Some quick housekeeping: the pitch is doing nothing, and neither is the ball. \u201cI think \u2018wreak\u2019 is very happy to work with \u2018vengeance\u2019 as well as \u2018havoc\u2019\u201d emails Tim Wiseman. Is it just me or did reading that provoke the image of Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction in everyone? 5th over: Australia 20-0 (Warner 6, Finch 14) Another tight Malinga over respected by Australia\u2019s openers. The only delivery of note was a slower ball that just held up on the surface and forced a checked drive from Warner that almost induced a c&amp;b. Isuru Udana is back on the field. \u201cAs an Indian born in this century, I experienced neither the pleasure of watching Robin Smith live nor the pain of witnessing yet another Indian bowling attack getting pummeled all around the ground in the 90s,\u201d emails Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cBut I have watched highlights featuring Mr Smith in the past, and the one you have provided today solidifies my opinion: he was rather good.\u201d Delighted you agree. As I\u2019ve mentioned before he was one of my first cricketing idols and his yellow bat grip was the first item of cricketing equipment I selected to emulate a professional. Unfortunately I was, and remain, cack with bat in hand. 4th over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 4, Finch 13) The ball is finding the middle of Finch\u2019s bat regularly, and most of the time with the kind of timing normally associated with Deontay Wilder and another man\u2019s jaw. Pradeep does some excellent fielding off his own bowling to deny another on-driven four but there\u2019s nothing he can do with a boundary clipped forward of midwicket. Isuru Udana did his best trying to haul that shot in before the rope but he failed, and in doing so dived headlong into the LCD advertising boards, jarring his left shoulder in the process. He has now left the field in some discomfort. 3rd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 8) In a sign of Warner\u2019s new-found maturity he\u2019s happy to allow Malinga to sling down a maiden, respecting the line and length and his inability to pierce the infield with those meaty defensive-ish strokes of his. \u201cAnother interesting aspect of \u2018wreaking havoc\u2019 is that there is no proper past tense,\u201d emails John Starbuck. \u201cYou have to use \u2018wrought havoc\u2019 or adopt versions of \u2018play havoc (with)\u2018. Havoc is obviously a difficult customer.\u201d 2nd over: Australia 12-0 (Warner 4, Finch 8) Goodness me, how\u2019s the touch from Aaron Finch!? First delivery of the day from Nuwan Pradeep is on a decent line and length but the Aussie skipper stands tall and caresses a textbook off drive on the up for four: think vintage Michael Vaughan. Four balls later he times another sweet sweet boundary, this one driven with the full face of the bat past the non-striker in a stroke that Finch holds for so long it looks as though the wind has caught him and he might never change. This would actually be fine because it was such a glorious follow through to a perfect on drive. \u201cNice shout out for words with only one friend\u201d emails Bill Pairman. \u201cMy favourite is \u201cdingly dell\u201d which works both ways. The only dingly thing is a dell, all dells are dingly. They\u2019re like an elderly couple who have been together since childhood, ever-faithful to each other, still as deeply enamoured as the day they first kissed.\u201d Very high standard of emails this morning. High fives all round. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 4, Finch 0) Malinga opens from the Vauxhall end and he begins superbly, swinging one into Warner\u2019s pads then beating the outside edge with a length delivery. Warner is typically unfussed, clipping the next off his pads through midwicket with a firm push that races away for four like it\u2019s hopped on an airport travelator. This is a fast outfield. Aaron Finch and David Warner are out in the middle. Lasith Malinga has the white ball in his hand. There\u2019s plenty of blue sky among the fluffy clouds in south London. Time for cricket. If today\u2019s lopsided looking contest fails to deliver, just wait until tomorrow... It is a match that \u2013 on the surface at least \u2013 is just one of 48 at this rain-splattered Cricket World Cup. But when India and Pakistan face off in Manchester on Sunday the sporting contest will be magnified and warped by so much else: the 70-plus years of shared history and antipathy between the two countries, the recent political tensions in Kashmir, and the stultifying pressure that comes when several hundred million eyeballs are watching on. Anthem time. A quick opportunity to inform you that today\u2019s officials are Aleem Dar and Richard Illingworth with Michael Gough keeping his eye on DRS. \u201cMy new number one cricket journo is without doubt Isa Guha. She has the ironic air of a daughter in an Ivy Compton-Burnett novel - trapped inside a Victorian country house with her father, a tyrannical male landowner, and his bumptious son, with only her native wit and charm available to combat them.\u201d I told you Ian Forth logging on was good, didn\u2019t I? Isa Guha is indeed brilliant. In Australia she is often saddled with some unenviable commentary box assignments which he handles with a grace I doubt I could emulate. Just staying with The Judge a little longer, it may well contain the greatest cover quote of all time from Mike Selvey in reference to Smith\u2019s famed Square Cut. \u201cShould I ever be condemned to beheading, I would like Robin Smith to be the swordsman,\u201d he wrote. Brilliant. \u201cPleased to see the word \u2018pundit\u2019 here,\u201d emails Peter Salmon. \u201cMy friends and I got obsessed with the word a while ago in relation to Aussie Rules football - we loved that the pundits were always \u2018being proved wrong\u2019. Looking into the etymology it turns out pundit comes from the Sanskrit \u2018pandita\u2019, meaning a teacher of any field of knowledge in Hinduism particularly the Vedic scriptures, dahrma, Hindi philosophy, or secular subjects such as music. So it seemed eminently reasonable they didn\u2019t know much about Aussie Rules, hence getting it wrong. More generally it means \u2018knowledge owner\u2019 and I have to say Alistair Cook\u2019s first stint on the wireless yesterday showed him as a pretty good \u2018knowledge owner.\u2019\u201d I haven\u2019t heard much from the Chef so I\u2019ll withhold judgement, but I\u2019m delighted he\u2019s made a good start to life behind the mic. The last time I was on here (Australia vs Pakistan) I shared that Robin Smith was one of my cricketing heroes growing up. That was in reference to a new autobiography being published about Smith\u2019s eventful life (written with OBO guru Rob Smyth). Smith recently spoke to Donald McRae and provided a glimpse at how raw some passages of The Judge are likely to be. \u201cWhat do you think about Lasit Malinga?\u201d asks CS Pancham. \u201cWill he cause problems for Australian batsmen?\u201d I would expect so, yes. I think he\u2019s a terrific bowler and ideally suited to the kinds of pitches we\u2019ve seen so far this tournament which have benefited that two-length approach (very full or very short). He averages 24.65 against Australia in ODIs with a strike rate of two wickets per ten overs. Ian Forth has logged on, which is always an enjoyable moment on the OBO. \u201cOB Jato makes a very pertinent point but my eye was drawn to \u201cwreck havoc\u201d. It\u2019s more usually \u201cwreak havoc\u201d but wreak\u2019s one of those funny words that only really likes hanging out with one friend, to wit, in its case, \u2018havoc\u2019. See also: \u2018fell swoop\u2019; Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali; Teresa May and her cat.\u201d One change also for Sri Lanka with Milinda Siriwardana replacing Suranag Lakmal. That means doubts over both Nuwan Pradeep (injured finger) and Lasith Malinga (flew home to attend funeral) have been resolved with the two bowlers making the starting line. Sri Lanka XI: Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Perera (wk), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Milinda Siriwardana, Nuwan Pradeep, Lasith Malinga One change to Australia\u2019s line-up with Jason Behrendorff replacing Nathan Coulter-Nile. Finch indicated the hero of his side\u2019s win over the Windies was a little stiff and sore. That still means a four-man pace attack with ten overs to be found from Glenn Maxwell, Aaron Finch, or even the lesser spotted Steve Smith, who was seen rolling his arm over in the nets this week. Australia XI: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Shaun Marsh, Glenn Maxwell, Alex Carey (wk), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Jason Behrendorff, Kane Richardson. Aaron Finch called incorrectly (his fifth lost toss in a row this World Cup) and Dimuth Karunaratne wasted no time sticking Australia in. Finch agreed with the strategy suggesting he would also have bowled first to take advantage of some overcast conditions and any life in the new pitch. Want to know what the Oval\u2019s like behind the scenes? Of course you do! And as luck would have it here\u2019s Mark Butcher to show you around. This is also an opportunity for me to segue into nominating Butch as my favourite cricketing pundit (and your chance to email or tweet me with your alternatives - with supporting information, of course). I\u2019ve long enjoyed his well-informed perspective on the game, his ability to move with the times, and most crucially how he argues his point confidently but respectfully in a manner that advances debate. This is a lovely read from Barney Ronay on the presence of rain during the early phase of this World Cup. Rain tells you the summer game is also about melancholy and boredom, that this is a story told often in minor chords too, its moments of colour bordered by vital passages of grey. In the current battle for the sport\u2019s soul rain stands on one side saying this is not a product to be sold by the yard. Formats will come and go. But you have to be made to love cricket, not simply offered it up ready-made. In England, at least, the uncertainty remains. Cricket will always fight with the skies. If you missed any of yesterday\u2019s action you can catch up here in written and audio formats. TLDR: England hammered the Windies but Roy and Morgan picked up injuries. \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s pacers could wreck unlikely havoc today, but I am concerned with only one query regarding Australia right now,\u201d emails OB Jato, \u201cStoinis?\u201d. Indeed, Australia\u2019s line-up is unbalanced without their allrounder and the selection strategy against Pakistan did not look like one capable of winning a World Cup. Marcus Stoinis remains unavailable for selection with the side strain he suffered against India but he is expected to return to training next week. Mel Jones has had a look at the pitch for Australian TV and she likes what she sees. It\u2019s a fresh surface and Jones reckons it\u2019ll have plenty of pace, unlike the worn tracks that have been used at the Oval so far this tournament that have lacked the venue\u2019s customary pace and bounce. Let\u2019s get the weather out of the way early - it\u2019s dry, and it is forecast to remain dry for the majority of play with just the slight risk of a shower during the afternoon. It\u2019s a bit nippy out still though with the temperature unlikely to get out of the teens while a brisk southerly will keep everyone on their toes. Hello everybody and welcome to match 20 of Cricket World Cup 2019 featuring Australia and Sri Lanka from the Oval. For Sri Lanka it\u2019s the first in a series of intimidating must-win fixtures if they are to make the semi-finals. After suffering a hammering at the hands of a merciless New Zealand in their tournament opener Sri Lanka have endured the misfortune of consecutive washouts against Pakistan and Bangladesh, two opponents they would have fancied their chances against. Results are now required against four of the top five ranked teams in ODI cricket, starting with the defending champions. For Australia it\u2019s a welcome chance to tinker with their sub-optimal approach before the knockout phase. The good news for Justin Langer is his big names have delivered under pressure, notably David Warner with the bat and Mitchell Starc with the ball, but the drop off in standard from the stars to the role players has been alarming. Moreover, there still appears a lack of clarity in selection and strategy leading to Usman Khawaja hovering like a bad smell in the batting order and captain Aaron Finch pressganged into lobbing down some auxiliary overs. The best of their best has largely been good enough to paper over cracks so far but the form of the other likely semi-finalists suggests improvement across the board is required for a sixth Australian triumph since 1987. Start time is 10.30am local (7.30pm AET) which means there\u2019s plenty of time to chew the fat about all things CWC beforehand. If you would like to contribute (and like Mr Kipling\u2019s cakes your input so far this tournament has been exceedingly good) you can send me an email or a tweet and I will do my best to add you to the coverage.",

On the other: the others. Is there really no better seam and swing bowling option than the fast-medium blah of Jason Behrendorff? Who tries to win a World Cup without a specialist spin bowler? Australia could yet end up winning but they will do so with one hand tied behind their backs.</p>",

Finch, Warner and Smith is, as they say on Channel Nine, a champion top order. Add in Starc and Pat Cummins and this is a team weighted with A-list qualities at the top end. Is also isn\u2019t hard to see how they might lose it, too. The batting lineup is unbalanced. Khawaja continues to skulk reproachfully around the top six like the ghost of Banquo. Australia\u2019s bowling also divides up into two sections. On the one hand Starc and Cummins. On the other: the others. Is there really no better seam and swing bowling option than the fast-medium blah of Jason Behrendorff? Who tries to win a World Cup without a specialist spin bowler? Australia could yet end up winning but they will do so with one hand tied behind their backs.",

A poor thing, you might say, and one whose deference to \u201cBoris\u201d has been a disgrace. But as his first press briefing showed, our next PM treats reporters who call him \u201cJohnson\u201d and hold him to account with a hostility he never shows to the flunkies on first name terms. Instead of being a moment where journalists questioned a politician, it was a new type of press conference where politicians who supported Johnson <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/12/boris-johnson-is-every-bit-as-dull-and-evasive-as-his-minders-hoped\" title=\"\">booed reporters</a> for asking questions.</p> <p>I could go on. An independent civil service is a check, if only a reality check, on deluded politicians. The Institute for Government tells me what I had already guessed: Brexit has produced an unprecedented rise in the number of political attacks on civil servants. One of the first acts of a Johnson regime will be to fire Olly Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s Brexit adviser. He has become a George Soros-style <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-5940011/ANDREW-PIERCE-Prime-Ministers-adviser-Europhile-zealot-bring-down\" title=\"\">hate figure</a> on the British right: the sinister manipulator its partisans blame for the inevitable failure of their impossible project.</p> <p>Once the greatest check on runaway power was the opposition. Jeremy Corbyn agrees with Johnson and Farage on the need for Brexit, however, and only queries the detail. His failure to support Remain has fractured the centre left, opening the prospect of a united right coming through the middle in a general election. In any case, look at my description of rightwing authoritarianism. It applies as well to the far left. Corbyn and his network of post-communists don\u2019t want to stop a recession. They are \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/16/why-are-labour-party-leaders-so-quiet-on-europe---maybe-it-is-the-lure-of-disaster\" title=\"\">disaster socialists</a>\u201d who hope, as Lenin hoped, that economic collapse will turn the masses to their cause. They would happily suspend parliament to force through a radical programme and nothing in their ideology suggests they believe in press freedom or civil service independence. They won\u2019t oppose what they yearn for.</p> <p>Opposition must now be as much without as within parliament. I am heartened to see that the next <a href=\"https://infacts.org/march-for-change-on-july-20-march-against-boris/\" title=\"\">pro-European march</a> on 20 July will be the start of a full-throated defence of EU membership rather than a process argument about the need for a second referendum. Protests on the streets will not occur in isolation. If any government risks no deal, the financial markets will go wild and employers will warn staff about their jobs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/13/rory-stewart-threatens-alternative-parliament-to-avoid-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">MPs may act independently</a> and reconvene away from a shuttered Westminster. It will be the greatest economic, social and political crisis of our lifetime.</p> <p>Whenever you talk about the far right or left, or make comparisons with Putinism and fascism, you are told it can\u2019t happen here. Don\u2019t be hysterical, old chap: Johnson is a joke, Farage a pub bore and Corbyn a passive-aggressive crank. They can\u2019t hurt us. The critics don\u2019t realise <em>it</em> has never happened here before because enough \u201chysterical\u201d citizens have stamped on <em>it</em> early and hard. We are late in the day this time around and the moment to start stamping is now.</p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",

What kind of popular democracy do you expect when the decisive voice in choosing the national leader is not the electorate\u2019s but the voices of 160,000 Tory activists? What of my trade of journalism? A poor thing, you might say, and one whose deference to \u201cBoris\u201d has been a disgrace. But as his first press briefing showed, our next PM treats reporters who call him \u201cJohnson\u201d and hold him to account with a hostility he never shows to the flunkies on first name terms. Instead of being a moment where journalists questioned a politician, it was a new type of press conference where politicians who supported Johnson booed reporters for asking questions. I could go on. An independent civil service is a check, if only a reality check, on deluded politicians. The Institute for Government tells me what I had already guessed: Brexit has produced an unprecedented rise in the number of political attacks on civil servants. One of the first acts of a Johnson regime will be to fire Olly Robbins, the prime minister\u2019s Brexit adviser. He has become a George Soros-style hate figure on the British right: the sinister manipulator its partisans blame for the inevitable failure of their impossible project. Once the greatest check on runaway power was the opposition. Jeremy Corbyn agrees with Johnson and Farage on the need for Brexit, however, and only queries the detail. His failure to support Remain has fractured the centre left, opening the prospect of a united right coming through the middle in a general election. In any case, look at my description of rightwing authoritarianism. It applies as well to the far left. Corbyn and his network of post-communists don\u2019t want to stop a recession. They are \u201cdisaster socialists\u201d who hope, as Lenin hoped, that economic collapse will turn the masses to their cause. They would happily suspend parliament to force through a radical programme and nothing in their ideology suggests they believe in press freedom or civil service independence. They won\u2019t oppose what they yearn for. Opposition must now be as much without as within parliament. I am heartened to see that the next pro-European march on 20 July will be the start of a full-throated defence of EU membership rather than a process argument about the need for a second referendum. Protests on the streets will not occur in isolation. If any government risks no deal, the financial markets will go wild and employers will warn staff about their jobs. MPs may act independently and reconvene away from a shuttered Westminster. It will be the greatest economic, social and political crisis of our lifetime. Whenever you talk about the far right or left, or make comparisons with Putinism and fascism, you are told it can\u2019t happen here. Don\u2019t be hysterical, old chap: Johnson is a joke, Farage a pub bore and Corbyn a passive-aggressive crank. They can\u2019t hurt us. The critics don\u2019t realise it has never happened here before because enough \u201chysterical\u201d citizens have stamped on it early and hard. We are late in the day this time around and the moment to start stamping is now. \u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist",

Had you collected scraps from interviewees?</strong><br>It was really hard, because I\u2019m good at observing. To create someone in order to observe them is a really big game of imagination, and I don\u2019t usually ever have to rely on my imagination. But once I had a character in mind, it was easy for me to say, \u201cWhat would he do now?\u201d because I believe most people operate from the same impulses. [I didn\u2019t collect] from interviewees but friends. When I turned 40, my friends started getting divorced. I wanted to understand it better because I had so much anxiety about divorce \u2013 from the minute I agreed to marry my husband, I have been in an obsessive defence against our marriage ending.</p> <p><strong>Did you have to resist trying to create the perfect character \u2013 how you\u2019d want someone to behave in a profile?</strong><br>I got into journalism because screenwriting and fiction weren\u2019t working out for me. Back when I started out trying to write [fiction], I made people too perfect because I didn\u2019t know if anyone would ever believe that a loving stable mother could also have seditious dreams of leaving her suburb. Or that a loving father would do whatever he can to make sure he\u2019s having sex every night. Finally I was able to see that I could worship someone like Gwyneth Paltrow and hate her at the same time, and that was something people responded to. What I\u2019ve learned is that people really love how messy the truth is. Then I could approach fiction with the same messiness.</p> <p><strong>Why do you have Toby as the centre of the story </strong><strong>and not Rachel?</strong><br>I told the story of a male synchronised swimmer a few years ago, and I loved that it was this white man fighting discrimination. It tickled me \u2013 putting a problem in the not-usually-oppressed person\u2019s hands is a really easy way for people to understand it. And of the friends who told me their [divorce] stories, the men were having so much more fun. The women dating on apps had so much anxiety. Men keep sending them dick pics, it\u2019s demoralising, they\u2019re worried that they don\u2019t look good any more.</p> <p><strong>The book is bleak </strong><strong>on female ambition.</strong><br>I remember on election day thinking, of course she [Hillary Clinton] lost \u2013 people hate women. All these people wearing \u201cThe future is female\u201d T-shirts made me forget. I was so disappointed in myself for allowing the winds of my optimism to gather. The next day, I wrote [the part] about how it will always be in the future that the future is female. There was a time when I wanted the writing to be timeless, but then I thought, that\u2019s not who I am: I can only write about what is going on at this particular minute, and at this particular minute, I am devastated over the state of gender relations.</p> <p><strong>In the book Rachel </strong><strong>is very high-achieving \u2013 how do women deal with the pressure that brings?</strong><br>The only thing that can help me is feeling less alone. I don\u2019t ever want to hear that someone did five hours of kundalini yoga; I want to hear about the roiling dissatisfaction that makes them do it. I will never take tips from anyone. I have spent hours with Gwyneth Paltrow. If I could be like that, I promise you I would be! Instead, the only things that were helpful for me was like when we were talking about her divorce. She said her divorce was the worst thing that happened to her. I do want to hear that nobody thinks they\u2019re making the right decisions; I want to stop asking myself if it comes easier to everyone else, because honestly, it isn\u2019t coming easily to me. Every decision I make I worry is the wrong decision.</p> <p><strong>Did writing this book assuage or exacerbate your anxiety about divorce?</strong><br>It assuaged it. I wrote this years ago now, and so the issues in it feel resolved to me. I was obviously struggling so much with something. I have resolved that the book is clearly not about my marriage. I don\u2019t think I ever really gave credit to how traumatic my parents\u2019 divorce was for me. I\u2019m very judgmental about people whose childhood issues [stem from] low-grade trauma \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about molestation, but everyone\u2019s parents get divorced. I think that stopped me from really understanding that a divorce is something you can move on from when it\u2019s your parents \u2013 until you get married.</p> <p><strong>You tweeted recently</strong><strong>: \u201cI have a certain kind of book that I like.\u201d What kind is that?</strong><br>I like a difficult book. I don\u2019t mean intellectually devouring; I mean it should make you think about hard things and play with your levels of compassion and invoke all your fears and make you ask yourself hard questions. I like full and total absorption, which happens to me with Donna Tartt, Elena Ferrante, Jonathan Franzen, Phillip Roth, John Irving.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite literary portrayal of a marriage or a divorce?</strong><br><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/542405/the-pistachio-prescription-by-paula-danziger/9780142406823/\" title=\"\"><em>The Pistachio Prescription by Paula Danziger</em></a> was the first book I ever read about divorce. I was 10. It was the first time I ever saw that this thing that had happened in my life had happened to others \u2013 my family were the first people on our block to get divorced and it was very exotic at the time.</p> <p><strong>Which other authors have stayed with you since childhood?</strong><br>When something has an emotional impact on me, I revisit it again and again from a craft perspective to figure out how it did that. So I read all the Judy Blumes and Paula Danzigers. Once you get me, you get me for ever. And from age 11, I was reading Philip Roth, and I reread those over and over \u2013 mostly because every time I reread them every two years, I literally understood new things.</p> <p><strong>Why were you reading Roth at 11?</strong><br>My mother was very religious and always on the lookout for smut. Everyone in fifth grade was reading the Sweet Valley High books. My mother took one look at those twin girls and she was like: \u201cNo way, there is sex in this book, those girls are clearly easy!\u201d My mother was an Israeli immigrant and didn\u2019t have the same kind of literary education we\u2019d had, so my older sister started bringing home Philip Roth books, which only had text on the cover and so we were able to get away with reading them. That\u2019s how I ended up with a confused, traumatised, filthy mind as a 12-year-old.</p> <p><strong>Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read?</strong><br>It\u2019s not a book but I\u2019ve never read <em>Macbeth</em> and I don\u2019t understand any <em>Macbeth</em> references.

[I didn\u2019t collect] from interviewees but friends. When I turned 40, my friends started getting divorced. I wanted to understand it better because I had so much anxiety about divorce \u2013 from the minute I agreed to marry my husband, I have been in an obsessive defence against our marriage ending. Did you have to resist trying to create the perfect character \u2013 how you\u2019d want someone to behave in a profile? I got into journalism because screenwriting and fiction weren\u2019t working out for me. Back when I started out trying to write [fiction], I made people too perfect because I didn\u2019t know if anyone would ever believe that a loving stable mother could also have seditious dreams of leaving her suburb. Or that a loving father would do whatever he can to make sure he\u2019s having sex every night. Finally I was able to see that I could worship someone like Gwyneth Paltrow and hate her at the same time, and that was something people responded to. What I\u2019ve learned is that people really love how messy the truth is. Then I could approach fiction with the same messiness. Why do you have Toby as the centre of the story and not Rachel? I told the story of a male synchronised swimmer a few years ago, and I loved that it was this white man fighting discrimination. It tickled me \u2013 putting a problem in the not-usually-oppressed person\u2019s hands is a really easy way for people to understand it. And of the friends who told me their [divorce] stories, the men were having so much more fun. The women dating on apps had so much anxiety. Men keep sending them dick pics, it\u2019s demoralising, they\u2019re worried that they don\u2019t look good any more. The book is bleak on female ambition. I remember on election day thinking, of course she [Hillary Clinton] lost \u2013 people hate women. All these people wearing \u201cThe future is female\u201d T-shirts made me forget. I was so disappointed in myself for allowing the winds of my optimism to gather. The next day, I wrote [the part] about how it will always be in the future that the future is female. There was a time when I wanted the writing to be timeless, but then I thought, that\u2019s not who I am: I can only write about what is going on at this particular minute, and at this particular minute, I am devastated over the state of gender relations. In the book Rachel is very high-achieving \u2013 how do women deal with the pressure that brings? The only thing that can help me is feeling less alone. I don\u2019t ever want to hear that someone did five hours of kundalini yoga; I want to hear about the roiling dissatisfaction that makes them do it. I will never take tips from anyone. I have spent hours with Gwyneth Paltrow. If I could be like that, I promise you I would be! Instead, the only things that were helpful for me was like when we were talking about her divorce. She said her divorce was the worst thing that happened to her. I do want to hear that nobody thinks they\u2019re making the right decisions; I want to stop asking myself if it comes easier to everyone else, because honestly, it isn\u2019t coming easily to me. Every decision I make I worry is the wrong decision. Did writing this book assuage or exacerbate your anxiety about divorce? It assuaged it. I wrote this years ago now, and so the issues in it feel resolved to me. I was obviously struggling so much with something. I have resolved that the book is clearly not about my marriage. I don\u2019t think I ever really gave credit to how traumatic my parents\u2019 divorce was for me. I\u2019m very judgmental about people whose childhood issues [stem from] low-grade trauma \u2013 I\u2019m not talking about molestation, but everyone\u2019s parents get divorced. I think that stopped me from really understanding that a divorce is something you can move on from when it\u2019s your parents \u2013 until you get married. You tweeted recently: \u201cI have a certain kind of book that I like.\u201d What kind is that? I like a difficult book. I don\u2019t mean intellectually devouring; I mean it should make you think about hard things and play with your levels of compassion and invoke all your fears and make you ask yourself hard questions. I like full and total absorption, which happens to me with Donna Tartt, Elena Ferrante, Jonathan Franzen, Phillip Roth, John Irving. What\u2019s your favourite literary portrayal of a marriage or a divorce? The Pistachio Prescription by Paula Danziger was the first book I ever read about divorce. I was 10. It was the first time I ever saw that this thing that had happened in my life had happened to others \u2013 my family were the first people on our block to get divorced and it was very exotic at the time. Which other authors have stayed with you since childhood? When something has an emotional impact on me, I revisit it again and again from a craft perspective to figure out how it did that. So I read all the Judy Blumes and Paula Danzigers. Once you get me, you get me for ever. And from age 11, I was reading Philip Roth, and I reread those over and over \u2013 mostly because every time I reread them every two years, I literally understood new things. Why were you reading Roth at 11? My mother was very religious and always on the lookout for smut. Everyone in fifth grade was reading the Sweet Valley High books. My mother took one look at those twin girls and she was like: \u201cNo way, there is sex in this book, those girls are clearly easy!\u201d My mother was an Israeli immigrant and didn\u2019t have the same kind of literary education we\u2019d had, so my older sister started bringing home Philip Roth books, which only had text on the cover and so we were able to get away with reading them. That\u2019s how I ended up with a confused, traumatised, filthy mind as a 12-year-old. Which classic novel are you most ashamed not to have read? It\u2019s not a book but I\u2019ve never read Macbeth and I don\u2019t understand any Macbeth references. I keep meaning to just read the Wikipedia page. \u2022 Fleishman Is in Trouble by Taffy Brodesser-Akner is published by Wildfire (\u00a318.99)",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has been forced into a humiliating concession after a week of mass protests, promising to indefinitely suspend efforts to pass a controversial new extradition law ahead of another demonstration that has been called for Sunday. Lam\u2019s announcement represented perhaps the most serious government climbdown in the face of public pressure since a security law was dropped in 2003, an important democratic moment for a city where people are free to demonstrate but not able to choose their leaders. However, opponents warned they saw it more as a tactical retreat than an admission of defeat, aimed at buying time to intimidate or demoralise opponents. There have already been reports of arrests in hospitals, as people sought treatment, and of digital activists. \u201cYou can say it was a partial victory, in the sense she has halted this bill at this moment,\u201d said the opposition lawmaker Charles Mok. \u201cWe are not celebrating. Many of us were still not satisfied that she hasn\u2019t withdrawn it completely, and the way she talked about police [brutality].\u201d He joined other activists and critics in urging residents to take to the streets again on Sunday to keep up pressure on the government and chief executive. Lam has proved a lightening rod for protesters, with many demanding her resignation. In a combative press conference after three days of silence, Lam repeatedly described herself as \u201cheartbroken\u201d, and admitted that the bill had \u201ccaused a lot of division\u201d in Hong Kong. But she insisted her only errors were of communication, defended the law as vital to security and promised to relaunch an improved version after further consultation. She also played down the size of demonstrations and repeatedly claimed police use of force was defensive. Earlier in the week she added fuel to public anger when she doubled down on support for the law and criticised protesters who had endured a day of teargas, rubber bullets and police beatings as \u201cspoiled children\u201d. Her abrupt reversal \u2013 reportedly made after meeting with one of China\u2019s most powerful leaders on Friday \u2013 was apparently aimed at warding off further chaos on Sunday, although Lam denied she was trying to appease the crowds. \u201cThe decision I made is not about pacifying people or, as some have said, restoring my damaged reputation,\u201d Lam told journalists, claiming she acted to stop violence escalating. \u201cThis is time to restore as quickly as possible calmness in society.\u201d The rise in tensions was almost entirely self-inflicted, after Lam tried to ram the hugely unpopular bill through the legislature before it broke up for the summer, leaving minimal time for consultation or debate despite its sweeping implications for everyone from dissidents to entrepreneurs. If the extradition bill becomes law, it would allow both residents and visitors to be sent to China for trial in opaque courts controlled by the Communist party. Critics say that would destroy the judicial \u201cfirewall\u201d that protects Hong Kong, and fatally undermine its economy and way of life. Some Hong Kong tycoons have already started moving assets abroad amid concern about the extradition law, Reuters has reported, citing financial advisers, bankers and lawyers. Lam\u2019s hurry was ostensibly aimed at bringing to justice a man who brutally murdered his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan, but authorities there worried it could affect their sovereignty and so said they would not use it. In response, hundreds of thousands of protesters thronged Hong Kong\u2019s streets to oppose it at the weekend and prevent legislators reaching parliament Wednesday to vote it through. The scale of the protests prompted intense international scrutiny, with the US presidential hopeful Joe Biden the latest figure to weigh in on the showdown, praising protesters\u2019 bravery and warning officials that the \u201cworld is watching\u201d. Lam and officials in Beijing now appear to have calculated that the political cost of temporary retreat and caving to public pressure would be less than that of further confrontation. Lam met one of China\u2019s most senior politicians, Han Zheng, in the Chinese border city of Shenzhen on Friday night to discuss the situation, the pro-Beijing Sing Tao reported. Zheng is the central government\u2019s point man on Hong Kong, a vice-premier and one of just seven members of the elite politburo standing committee. The legislature is due to go on summer recess in July, and Lam said it would not be possible for lawmakers to examine the bill within this year; it is possible it will not be reopened for even longer. \u201cIt looks unlikely they would dare to resume the controversy in the near future, not within this year,\u201d said Claudia Mo, another opposition lawmaker, although she feared the bill would return. \u201cA suspension is essentially a postponement. They are just delaying the pain.\u201d Others were more hopeful that, particularly if public pressure continues, the government might back away permanently as it did after mass protests about a new security law in 2003. \u201cThere is some historical precedent here. Article 23 that was supposed to regulate national security was also indefinitely shelved, and it hasn\u2019t come back since,\u201d said Lokman Tsui, Assistant Professor at the School of Journalism and Communication of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. \u201cSo if you look at that, it might mean that it won\u2019t come back. But at the same time, I think people are right to insist on more forceful language including the actual retraction of [the law].\u201d Organisers of Sunday\u2019s march said it was going ahead and called on Hong Kong residents to turn out again in large numbers, to protest police violence and a round-up of many demonstrators, as well as the law itself. \u201cWe saw so many innocent citizens subject to police force,\u201d said Sham Tsz kit, convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, which is helping organise the demonstration. \u201cOur anger is unprecedented, we call on people to protest tomorrow, we need to tell people we are guarding Hong Kong,\u201d The group has also set up a trust to support arrested and injured protestors. A small crowd of protesters already gathered near government headquarters on Saturday said they had no faith in Lam\u2019s promises of greater consultation, and were bracing for a long fight. \u201cIt\u2019s a temporary measure to cool our anger.

Restaurant Ikoyi, London I\u2019ve been to this modern west African restaurant in central London a few times recently and I really like it. They\u2019re experimenting with traditional Nigerian dishes such as jollof rice and suya and finding new and interesting ways of presenting them. Visually, the dishes are really exciting: for one starter, a fried slice of plantain is dipped in raspberry dust and served on a black plate with a white Scotch bonnet sauce. It\u2019s all very beautifully displayed, but delicious too. The interiors are great as well, and there\u2019s a nice ambience: it all makes sense. If I could afford it, I\u2019d eat there every day. 5. Book For Every One by Jason Reynolds I designed the cover of this book, which is a rallying-cry for dreamers. It\u2019s written as a poem in the form of a letter and it says that no matter how young or old you are, it\u2019s OK to dream, and you should hold on to your dreams and never let them go. Jason Reynolds is an American author who writes mostly for a younger audience, but this book is for people of all ages. It\u2019s very easy to read, and that\u2019s the beauty of it. It gives you energy to be what you want to be and keep going, no matter how big your dream is. 6. Poetry Poetry Slam at the Roundhouse, London A friend of mine invited me to the annual Poetry Slam final at the Roundhouse a couple of weeks ago. I\u2019d been to rap battles before, but this was my first time going to a poetry event and I\u2019m so glad I went. It\u2019s an open-mic affair with 12 poets on stage doing two rounds of poems each. The standard was really high and the guy who won, Kareem Parkins-Brown, really made me laugh \u2013 his winning poem was very funny on gentrification, but with a serious point. It was an incredible evening. I\u2019ll be going to a lot more poetry events from now on.",

He wants to write about what interests him, but within that he\u2019s also fascinated, regardless of gender, by all the characters he\u2019s writing. That\u2019s surprisingly rare. This play ticks every single box: it\u2019s full of ideas, it\u2019s a wonderful character for a woman of my age, all the other characters are interesting and it\u2019s a play I\u2019d pay money to see.</p> <p><strong>Can you tell me a bit about it?</strong><br>It takes you through three decades, from 1997 to 2017, in the life of a family and you find out how their ideas change. It\u2019s about the casual slights and hurts and the intense connections and love that run in a complicated, well-meaning family.</p> <p><strong>Is it political?</strong><br>The political landscape is part and parcel of what\u2019s going on, because the mother and father are a couple whose relationship with politics began in the 1980s with their response to Margaret Thatcher.

For older women that\u2019s definitely true because writing mirrors society, and women in their 50s are regarded as having waning powers, whereas men of the same age are seen as being at the height of their powers.

      "body": "<p>Has working-hours drinking culture died or is it just slumped in an office lavatory cubicle, sleeping off a liquid lunch?</p> <p>I ask, because the London Metal Exchange has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/14/london-metal-exchange-bans-traders-from-daytime-drinking-alcohol\" title=\"\">banned staff from drinking</a> during working hours, just as Lloyds of London did in 2017. Which has to be good. (City traders, dealing in millions and billions, probably need to be sober? Discuss). Though maybe it\u2019s yet another sign of the end of an era.</p> <p>The first thing to note is that drinking during working hours is totally different to socialising at night. Compared with daytime inebriation, drinking at night is amateur hour. Nor is this the European form, where nice, elegant people enjoy the subtle bouquet of a glass of merlot. I\u2019m talking about people leaving work for \u201clunch\u201d, drinking copiously, then returning to work, fully convinced of their competence. A quintessentially British phenomenon that I was surprised to discover wasn\u2019t entirely confined to journalists and politicians. Arguably, what\u2019s interesting isn\u2019t that this culture is ending, rather, that it was ever allowed to begin.</p> <p>The key to understanding the day-drinking personality is to ignore their actual job and realise that inside, where it matters (maaan!), they are bohemians refusing to bow to societal convention. Think: Charles Bukowski meets Hunter S Thompson with a whiff of <em>The Likely Lads</em> \u2013 in certain circles, teamed with an exclusionary boys\u2019 club mentality.</p> <p>It\u2019s not only men who are guilty of macho showboating over who can drink the most for the longest. While I never regretted my daytime drinking, other people did on my behalf. That\u2019s the other thing about working-hours drinkers \u2013 most of us are royal pains in the arse.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s not all bad news. Without wishing to glorify dysfunctional daytime drinking (which can lead to serious problems with alcohol), the reason it kept happening was because it could be fun, sometimes even strangely creative and productive. One of the problems with any kind of drinking in the day is that there\u2019s no natural break for sleeping, unless you\u2019re resourceful (see previous point about lavatory cubicles), which meant that days often morphed into endless, nightmarish, gonzo road-movies. There\u2019s also the fact that, for some, daylight drinking boosts the impact of alcohol.</p> <p>What stopped my daytime drinking is what stops most people \u2013 ageing. I couldn\u2019t hack it any more. However, that flags another key change. Traditionally, there would be a new younger generation of working-hours drinkers, proudly returning pissed to the office on behalf of all those who couldn\u2019t any more. Instead, increasingly, you hear about young people shirking alcohol. Or workplaces banning it.</p> <p>With the odd pocket of resistance, perhaps the culture of working-hours drinking truly is dying out. Time was, life was too serious not to have a drink. Now, it\u2019s too serious to have one.</p> <h2>Have a heart, Harry: Meghan wasn\u2019t to the palace born</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"53b8b7bdb9e7cf851fb26627efbc90c466bd1701\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b8b7bdb9e7cf851fb26627efbc90c466bd1701/0_79_874_524/500.jpg\" alt=\"Harry and Meghan\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harry and Meghan: a sharp lesson in royal ways.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How long do you think it would take to master the intricacies of being royal?

      "bodyText": "Has working-hours drinking culture died or is it just slumped in an office lavatory cubicle, sleeping off a liquid lunch? I ask, because the London Metal Exchange has banned staff from drinking during working hours, just as Lloyds of London did in 2017. Which has to be good. (City traders, dealing in millions and billions, probably need to be sober? Discuss). Though maybe it\u2019s yet another sign of the end of an era. The first thing to note is that drinking during working hours is totally different to socialising at night. Compared with daytime inebriation, drinking at night is amateur hour. Nor is this the European form, where nice, elegant people enjoy the subtle bouquet of a glass of merlot. I\u2019m talking about people leaving work for \u201clunch\u201d, drinking copiously, then returning to work, fully convinced of their competence. A quintessentially British phenomenon that I was surprised to discover wasn\u2019t entirely confined to journalists and politicians. Arguably, what\u2019s interesting isn\u2019t that this culture is ending, rather, that it was ever allowed to begin. The key to understanding the day-drinking personality is to ignore their actual job and realise that inside, where it matters (maaan!), they are bohemians refusing to bow to societal convention. Think: Charles Bukowski meets Hunter S Thompson with a whiff of The Likely Lads \u2013 in certain circles, teamed with an exclusionary boys\u2019 club mentality. It\u2019s not only men who are guilty of macho showboating over who can drink the most for the longest. While I never regretted my daytime drinking, other people did on my behalf. That\u2019s the other thing about working-hours drinkers \u2013 most of us are royal pains in the arse. However, it\u2019s not all bad news. Without wishing to glorify dysfunctional daytime drinking (which can lead to serious problems with alcohol), the reason it kept happening was because it could be fun, sometimes even strangely creative and productive. One of the problems with any kind of drinking in the day is that there\u2019s no natural break for sleeping, unless you\u2019re resourceful (see previous point about lavatory cubicles), which meant that days often morphed into endless, nightmarish, gonzo road-movies. There\u2019s also the fact that, for some, daylight drinking boosts the impact of alcohol. What stopped my daytime drinking is what stops most people \u2013 ageing. I couldn\u2019t hack it any more. However, that flags another key change. Traditionally, there would be a new younger generation of working-hours drinkers, proudly returning pissed to the office on behalf of all those who couldn\u2019t any more. Instead, increasingly, you hear about young people shirking alcohol. Or workplaces banning it. With the odd pocket of resistance, perhaps the culture of working-hours drinking truly is dying out. Time was, life was too serious not to have a drink. Now, it\u2019s too serious to have one. Have a heart, Harry: Meghan wasn\u2019t to the palace born How long do you think it would take to master the intricacies of being royal? I pondered this, as a bizarre video clip emerged of Prince Harry appearing to snap at his wife, Meghan Markle, as they stood on the balcony with the rest of the royal family during the recent trooping the colour. Unless my imagination is running away with me, Harry appears to be, not asking, but ordering (yes, you read right, ordering) his wife to \u201cturn around\u201d. It\u2019s not what\u2019s said, it\u2019s the brusque, cold way it\u2019s done. When Markle turns around, she appears chastened and a little upset. Could a royal aide please help Harry \u2013 his mask appears to have slipped. OK, maybe that\u2019s a bit much, but still, this was disquieting. Markle gave birth a matter of weeks ago \u2013 she, if anyone, should be the one who\u2019s entitled to snap. Obviously, she needed to turn the right way, especially as the national anthem was about to play. However, you\u2019d have thought she had rocked up in a bikini, smoking a spliff, making peace signs, to warrant such treatment \u2013 not committed the great crime of turning to speak to her husband for all of two seconds. Give her credit \u2013 she always seems to try her best with royal duties. She\u2019s even submitted to being dressed in weird stiff, dowdy outfits as though she\u2019s trapped permanently in some existential royal racing enclosure sponsored by Fenn Wright Manson. Of course trooping the colour is important, but whatever she (briefly) did \u201cwrong\u201d on the balcony, it was clearly not intentionally disrespectful. It\u2019s the royal attitude that\u2019s at fault here. Harry and other born-and-bred royals should realise they\u2019ve had a lifetime to master deportment and protocol and, even then, they\u2019ve frequently screwed up. Nazi fancy-dress outfits, anyone? Chuka Umunna at least gave it a go, so save your sneers Oh, the irony of anybody deriding the former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna for being some kind of scheming careerist for joining the Liberal Democrats. I mean, seriously? Change UK performed poorly at the European elections, so Umunna decided to join the Lib Dems. In the past, he has criticised them for forming a coalition with the Tories, but then, who didn\u2019t? The party deserved to be criticised then, just as it deserves to be supported now.

Umunna announced his decision to join the Liberal Democrats on Thursday, 10 days after leaving Change UK and four months after leaving the Labour party. The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Vince Cable, announced this weekend that he was appointing Umunna as the party\u2019s Treasury and business spokesman. \u201cChuka has agreed to work in the Commons with our business and economy team, alongside Susan Kramer and Chris Fox who speak on these issues in the House of Lords,\u201d said Cable. \u201cHis experience as shadow business secretary will be invaluable to the party in pursuing our shared values.\u201d Senior Lib Dem MPs including Jo Swinson, the frontrunner to be the next Lib Dem leader, and Ed Davey, the other contender in the leadership battle, were quick to welcome Umunna to the party last week. In the hours following his move the Liberal Democrats\u2019 head of membership and engagement reported a surge of 800 new members. In Umunna\u2019s south London constituency this weekend, many of his supporters remain undeterred by his latest political move, including the antiques shop owner Steve Wright, 67, who said: \u201cI think they should just leave him alone. He\u2019s doing a good job for Streatham anyway, so why rock the boat and elect somebody else?\u201d Wright said he did not think Umunna should face a byelection in Streatham as he felt a general election was imminent anyway. \u201cI would probably vote for him because he\u2019s a man of principle.

      "bodyText": "And here are the top scorers in the tournament. Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report. Confirmed, the Dutch are through Vivianne Miedema\u2019s two goals have done the damage here. Cameroon were a threat until her second, a lovely finish to make it 3-1, with Onguene, the pantomime villain, the pick of their players. Cameroon are not done yet; they can beat New Zealand and still go through. 90+2 min: Leuko pushes over the lively Beerensteyn, who has been a threat since coming on. The free-kick will be taken slowly. Spitse smashes it in what may well be a shot, and the goalkeeper flaps at it, but the ball goes out the other side for a throw...and that\u2019s it. 90 min: There will be just two minutes added on at full-time. 89 min: The Dutch looking so much more confident now. Spitse, from long distance, has a hearty dig. The ball flies over, but vital time is being eaten up. 88 min: Cameroon, who can go through if they get a decent win against New Zealand, have been a little too vulnerable in defence, specifically the flanks of their defence. 86 min: Miedema\u2019s finishing has been the difference, and in a game where she has onky flitted in and out of proceedings. Miedema finds the ball in space down a left-hand channel, and unleashes a shot. That makes her the record Dutch goalscorer at 22, and that will be that. The Dutch will be in the last 16. 83 min: A Dutch break is rather spoiled by Miedema slowing down its pace by playing an overly casual ball. Her team retain it, which is their best route to seeing this game out. Cameroon, though, soon force the Dutch to go back to the goalie. 81 min: Close for Cameroon! Onguene has switched side and cuts in from the right, beating Bloodworth for pace, and then Akaba gets a shot in. It is deflected narrowly wide. The Dutch are living on their nerves and look tired, too. 79 min: Like so many games in the tournament, aside from you know what, this has been a close contest, with the overriding favourite unable to put the underdog away. 77 min: Both teams a little ragged at this point. The Dutch look nervy while Cameroon are struggling to piece much in the way of attacking moves together. Onguene and Nchout are having to try solo efforts to force matters. 75 min: Final Cameroon sub: Enganamouit, who has tired, is replaced by Akaba. 73 min: It\u2019s a corner to Cameroon. Can they exploit it? Nchout drills the ball low and the Dutch have little problem clearing their lines. 72 min: An Onguene break is tackled well by Dekker, to many cheers from the Dutch fans. Miedema gets a sighter at goal, but cannot get enough purchase on the ball. 71 min: Dutch substitution: Van de Donk, who has been quiet, comes off for Jill Roord, yet another Arsenal player. 70 min: Beerensteyn, down that Cameroon left, makes an impressive dart but is unable to find a team-mate. Cameroon break, with Nchout, who has played well since coming on, causing trouble. 68 min: Another Cameroon yellow. Martens cuts inside and is hacked down by Feudjio. 66 min: Dutch sub: van de Sanden for Beerensteyn. Cameroon sub: Mbelek off for Menene. 65 min: Onguene charges down the left, finds Nchout, but Yango\u2019s shot is miles over. 64 min: Martens, who has been quiet since the opening moments, shows off her skills with superb control to make room to get in a cross. The left-hand side has not seen much traffic in this game. 63 min: More needle as van de Donk buys a foul by her own goal-line, receiving the expected clattering. 62 min: A look at that Miedema goal if you fancy. 60 min: Cameroon sub: Abam goes off for Nchout. 59 min: The Dutch sitting back now, and looking to go the break. \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d rings out from those in Oranje, with backing of a band, which seems to have much more of a repetoire than that group of atonal Englishmen. 57 min: Cameroon mount a rare passing move in the opposition half but cannot get the ball to Onguene. Van de Sanden cuts into the box at the other end, but is tackled just at the moment of release before Miedema, on the end of a Groenen cross, slashes a volley wide. She couldn\u2019t get her foot over the ball. 55 min: Another Dutch attack down their right, Cameroon\u2019s left, but this time they can\u2019t exploit that weak spot. Van de Sanden tries to find Miedema but the pass is cut out. 53 min: Rather unsporting jeers for Onguene as she leaves the field, though she will soon be coming back on, and to more unsporting jeers. 51 min: The Dutch fans back in full voice, and booing Onguene for staying down after another tackle on her. She looks in genuine pain this time as well. Van Lunteren came across her and knocked her to the floor. The Cameroon coach again up in arms on the sideline. An elbow is the claim made, but that doesn\u2019t look to be the case. 49 min: That Cameroon defence has definite weak spot down its left and that\u2019s twice the Dutch have used it to score goals. It didn\u2019t help that the defence went to sleep. A well-worked free-kick, as the ball is played out to the right, the cross comes in for Bloodworth, who gets a second bite and scores from close in. 46 min: Let\u2019s hope for more of that needle. Both teams have really been mixing it, with the Dutch getting distracted by all the shenanigans. Makes for good viewing, mind you. How Mbeleck was not sent off for that high kick I still can\u2019t tell you. Off we go for the second half... That is probably a fair scoreline on the balance of play, as Onguene has been excellent for Cameroon and the Dutch were a little off their game. Miedema\u2019s finish was superb, but she has not seen enough of the ball. 45+3 min: Spitse\u2019s free-kick is cleared by the Cameroon defence, which is the last action of the half. 45 min+1: First corner of the game and it\u2019s gone to Cameroon, which is cleared. The Dutch blaze to the other end and Miedema gets on the ball. She takes too much time on the ball and is crowded out. 45 min: Well, well. The noise in the crowd is now coming from the Dutch fans. There will be three minutes added on at the end of this half. The thorn in the Dutch side equalises just 150 seconds after their goal. A long ball is launched down the centre of their defence and Onguene seizes on it and finishes smartly. 42 min: Just as it looked Cameroon had knocked the Dutch off their game, Miedema, so quiet before, scores her first ever World Cup goal. She was unmarked and was never going to miss from there. Van de Sanden finally gets some space down the right and her cross is headed in by the Arsenal goal machine. 40 min: Cameroon pressing high and are cutting off the Dutch\u2019s attempts to play across the back. 38 min: Yellow card! The Dutch have lost their mojo and the game is being reduced to a pitched battle. Mbeleck\u2019s tackle on Groenen was decent enough but it was followed by a high follow through that reminds of Paul Gascoigne on Gary Parker in 1991. That could have been red as it looked like a loss of control. Gazza should have been sent off, too. He doubtless now wishes he had been. 34 min: Van Lunteren leaves the field but comes back on again, but only after a delay during which Cameroon mount an attack but fail to get a shot in. 33 min: Van Lunteren jumps for a high ball but comes over the top of Enganamouit and crashes to the floor. She is being given the concussion test, as she does look dazed. 31 min: Van de Sanden looked to have escaped down the right side of Cameroon\u2019s box, only for Leuko to rob her. 30 min: Alain Djeumfa, the Cameroon coach, has calmed down from before, but continues to prowl the sideline. His team are responding to him at the moment. 28 min: A long, through ball is aimed at Miedema but doesn\u2019t reach its target. The Dutch resorting to going long already? 26 min: Ongueune down the left, skips past one, but cannot beat a firm challenge from Van Lunteren. Cameroon causing real problems now, and the Dutch team has lost its previous fluency. 25 min: Van de Sanden, she of the leopardskin hair, changes her boots. She needed to, since she has kept slipping over. 24 min: Spitse takes out Onguene with a tackle, and the forward stays down to heavy boos. She is the central figure in the game so far. She gets some magic spray and will be OK to carry on, though that never looked in much doubt. 22 min: Onguene, being booed by the Dutch fans, finds space down the left-hand channel and gets a shot in. There are signs that the Cameroon attack can present some danger for the Dutch defence, which looks ropey to say the least. 20 min: There are ructions, and the ref has to come over to warn Onguene, who it seems was guilty of throwing water over the Dutch subs\u2019 bench. Seems to be a bit of needle out there, and perhaps the game might be the better for that. 18 min: Van de Sanden escapes what looks like a ready booking for a heavy tackle. The Cameroon coach is not happy at all with that decision. 16 min: First chorus of Dj Otzi\u2019s Hey Baby from the Dutch hordes. The original version was Brian Channel, no less. 15 min: Yellow card. Van de Donk is fouled by Manie, and a card is unsheathed and waved in her direction. Spitse takes the free-kick and the ball is hacked away. 12 min: Close for Cameroon! Onguene launches one from long range and it goes narrowly wide. 10 mins Martens takes the ball down with a neat touch, cutting inside off the left with her right foot in the Dutch style of inverted wingers. This time, as keeps happening, she runs into heavy traffic. 9 min: The Dutch are ever pushing onwards while Cameroon, as they did against Canada, are sat deep, which seems a waste of their attacking qualities. 7 min: Van de Donk takes a sighter at goal. It drifts over but she is fully in the mood today. Then, Cameroon goalkeeper Ngo makes something of a mess of a lofted ball and Miedema was lurking. Ngo clasps the ball with some relief. 6 min: Martens\u2019 solo run takes her deep into the Cameroon box, and there is panic as the ball loops its way back to van de Donk. Last-ditch stuff already from the African team. 4 min: This is a very noisy affair so far. Every Dutch attack is greeted with a roar. 2 min: The Dutch settle into a passing rhythm and try to get van de Donk away, but the ball is overhit. And away we go...and Miedema gets knocked over immediately when a Cameroon pass hits her firmly in the chest. That looked painful. Something of a shock to see Dominique Bloodworth line up at centre-back when she has played in midfield for Arsenal. That\u2019s total football for you. Here come the teams, and they are greeted by a Seven Nations Army chorus. There is something of \u201cO Little Town Of Bethlehem\u201d in the Dutch anthem. The Dutch support is making all the noise, with 13,000 estimated to be in Valenciennes, which is in the French north and highly accessible from the Netherlands. The teams have arrived in Valenciennes, and a few of the Cameroon players are grooving away to a boombox as they get off the coach. There is that possibility that one of these teams might face England in the next round. Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s analysis of last night\u2019s 1-0 defeat of Argentina. Those teams in a more analogue fashion. Netherlands: Van Veenendaal, Van Lunteren, Bloodworth, Dekker, Van Es, Spitse, van de Donk, Groenen, van de Sanden, Miedema, Martens. Subs: Kop, van Dongen, Pelova, Renate Jansen, Kaagman, Ellen Jansen, Kerkdijk, Roord, Beerensteyn, van der Most, Geurts. Cameroon: Ngo, Feudjio, Leuko, Manie, Johnson, Meffometou, Abam, Yango, Ngo Mbeleck, Onguene, Enganamouit. Subs: Mambingo, Nchout, Ejangue, Ngono Mani, Awona, Menene, Abena, Sonkeng, Akaba, Ngo Ndoumbouk, Takounda, Ongmahan. Referee: Casey Reibelt (Australia) The Dutch fans seem up for it. Some Women\u2019s World Cup reading matter ahead of the big kick-off. Here are the teams. It has to be said that the Dutch team rather disappointed in their opener with New Zealand, but Jill Roord\u2019s late winner was a real fillip. Win this game as expected - Cameroon are 25/1 for the win - and the knock-out stages beckon.

Four Arsenal stars and WSL champions in Sari van Veenendaal, Vivianne Miedema, Dani\u00eblle van de Donk and Dominique Bloodworth are expected to start, though the latter has now fled the Gunners nest to join Wolfsburg and the goalie is without a club after her contract expired. Cameroon, meanwhile, need a win to keep hopes alive, having lost 1-0 to Canada in their opening match. The Indomitable Lionesses showed that they are decent in defence but could do with some attacking quality if they are to do some damage to the Dutch. Kick-off: 2pm BST and in Cameroon (3pm local).",

      "bodyText": "Tory leadership candidates have insisted there must be no unchallenged \u201ccoronation\u201d for frontrunner Boris Johnson at the latest round of hustings. Senior cabinet ministers were reported to have hatched plans to force other candidates to withdraw from the race after Johnson comfortably topped the poll in the first ballot of MPs this week. Among the rivals condemning the revelation were the home secretary, Sajid Javid, and Rory Stewart, who both insisted there must be a proper contest. As he arrived at leadership hustings for the party grassroots organised by the National Conservative Convention on Saturday, Javid said senior figures should learn from the mistakes of the last leadership contest in which Theresa May went through without opposition after Andrea Leadsom dropped out. \u201cThe party and the country deserve a good choice,\u201d he told reporters outside the event. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see a coronation. There needs to be a proper process that\u2019s followed through. \u201cWe had a coronation the last time. That didn\u2019t work out well so let\u2019s not make the same mistake again.\u201d Stewart, the international development secretary, said: \u201cThe members of the Conservative party, who are wise, sensible, experienced people, deserve to have a choice. \u201cWe should have learned from the last time round coronations are not the way to do democratic politics.\u201d Johnson, who has been criticised by his fellow candidates for his reluctance to appear on television debates and submit to greater public scrutiny, avoided reporters after his Range Rover parked at a side door at a London hotel where the event was held. Stewart, something of an outsider in the contest and among the keenest critics of Johnson, accused the frontrunner of adopting a presidential approach. \u201cThe whole genius of British politics is that we don\u2019t behave like American presidents sweeping up in a motorcade. We\u2019re all about talking to people,\u201d he said. On Sunday, Channel 4 will represent the former foreign secretary and London mayor with an empty podium after he declined an invitation to participate in a television debate with his five remaining rivals. Earlier, the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab lashed out at Johnson, claiming that party members would reject a leader who could be viewed as part of the \u201cprivileged elite\u201d and questioning his \u201cmettle\u201d to be prime minister. Asked how he would stop Johnson from winning as he left he hustings, Raab said: \u201cWe should have proper scrutiny of everyone. The longer this goes on, the more the underdog gets their shot.\u201d The foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, took a less critical approach, refusing to say whether Johnson should take the blame for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention in Iran. On her latest decision to go on hunger strike \u2013 which her husband will also take part in from London \u2013 he added: \u201cOur message to Iran is whatever the disagreements you may have with the United Kingdom, there is an innocent woman at the heart of this.\u201d",

Indian mining group <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/adani-cleared-to-start-carmichael-coalmine-work-as-groundwater-plans-approved\" title=\"\">Adani last week announced plans to start work on a A$2bn (\u00a31bn) coal mine in Australia</a> after a decade of opposition from climate campaigners.</p> <p>The Queensland mine is expected to produce coal that, once burned in power plants, will emit 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year for more than 50 years.</p> <p> Wind and solar renewable power is the world\u2019s fastest-growing energy source: it grew by 14.5% last year, led by a surge of investment in China. But the strides do not go far enough, fast enough. \u201cYou have to run very fast just to stand still,\u201d Dale says.</p> <p>The global power generation picture is \u201cdepressingly\u201d unchanged from 20 years ago, he says. Three flat lines show an unwavering breakdown of the global electricity mix: last year coal made up 38%, non-fossil fuels reached 36% and the rest of the world\u2019s power was generated by gas and oil. This is the same as in 1998.</p> <p>\u201cIf rising demand was to be met by renewable energy, renewable generation would need to have grown more than twice as quickly over the past three years than it actually did,\u201d Dale says. \u201cAlternatively, the same reduction in carbon emissions could have been achieved by replacing around 10% of coal in the power sector with natural gas.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Wider temperature swings seem to be making homes and businesses turn up heating and air-conditioning more often</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>BP\u2019s backing for gas is unsurprising and self-serving: the company owns a vast portfolio of gas fields, and it plans to expand this within the business as oil falls from favour. It also makes sense: gas generation emits around half the carbon of coal, and avoids much of the air pollution which has become a major concern in Asia\u2019s growing cities.</p> <p>However, gas is still a hydrocarbon and its use cannot grow unchecked within the energy system without driving carbon emissions higher.</p> <p>The demand for gas increased by 5.3% in 2018, one of its strongest growth rates for over 30 years. Its use accounted for 45% of the increase in global energy consumption last year.</p> <p>The gas \u201cbonanza\u201d was led by the US shale boom, says Dale. The US shale heartlands in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Permian basins produced an extra 78 billion cubic metres of gas last year. This is the same growth in one year as the previous 12 combined. </p> <p>The surge in US gas production was used mainly to meet its own booming domestic demand. The US recorded the third-highest growth for energy consumption last year: it is the only G7 nation at the top of the energy growth league table; the rest of the top 10 are developing economies.</p> <p>Dale points to a worrying vicious climate cycle to explain part of the US boom. Research suggests that wider swings in temperature are nudging homes and businesses to turn up either heating systems or air conditioners more often. Last year, the number of particularly hot or cold days in the US was the highest for 50 years. And temperature swings in the first months of 2019 are proving to be just as wide of seasonal norms.</p> <p>This may reflect \u201crandom variation\u201d in weather patterns, says Dale. Or it may signal a worrying climate feedback loop which will make it harder to tackle the climate crisis.</p> <p>\u201cIf there is a link between the growing levels of carbon in the atmosphere and the weather patterns observed in 2018,\u201d he says, \u201cthis would raise the possibility of a vicious cycle: increasing levels of carbon leading to more extreme weather patterns, which in turn trigger stronger growth in energy usage \u2013 and emissions.\u201d</p>",

Last week, Norway\u2019s parliament confirmed by unanimous vote that its $1tn sovereign wealth fund would dump $13bn of fossil fuel investments \u2013 and start investing billions in renewables. The move is designed to protect Norway\u2019s state-owned investment fund from the decline in fossil fuels that will be vital if full-blown climate catastrophe is to be averted. But fossil fuels are by no means in terminal decline, according to a recent review of the global energy industry. BP\u2019s annual energy review revealed only days before the Norwegian vote that carbon emissions rose at the fastest rate in almost a decade last year. The figures revealed that the unexpected spike was caused by a growing appetite for energy, that was being met by fossil fuels. And the biggest offender in climate terms is coal. Spencer Dale, BP\u2019s chief economist, says the world\u2019s surging demand for energy \u2013 it rose by 2.9% last year \u2013 has cemented the defiant growth of coal. Consumption had climbed for a second consecutive year following three years of decline. \u201cThe peak in global coal consumption, which many thought had occurred in 2013, now looks less certain,\u201d Dale says. \u201cAnother couple of years of increases close to last year\u2019s would take global consumption comfortably above 2013 levels.\u201d The creeping growth of coal worldwide has come via the electricity generation sector, but in the UK, coal-fired power is to be entirely snuffed out by 2025 under government plans. The process is already under way. Coal-fired electricity was just 5% of all power generation in the UK last year, which allowed the National Grid to trumpet its greenest-ever winter. Since then, the closure of two coal plants has been announced, which will cut number of UK coal plants to five from next year. Britain\u2019s battle to wean itself off coal is helped by a rise in renewables but also \u2013 crucially \u2013 by the fact that in a country of sluggish growth and rising energy efficiency, demand for power has flatlined. The same cannot be said for fast-developing countries in Asia, for example, where the appetite for electricity is growing rapidly, and renewable energy is not increasing anything like fast enough to keep coal at bay. Asia\u2019s appetite for coal-fired electricity is keeping coal production alive too. Indian mining group Adani last week announced plans to start work on a A$2bn (\u00a31bn) coal mine in Australia after a decade of opposition from climate campaigners. The Queensland mine is expected to produce coal that, once burned in power plants, will emit 700 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year for more than 50 years. Wind and solar renewable power is the world\u2019s fastest-growing energy source: it grew by 14.5% last year, led by a surge of investment in China. But the strides do not go far enough, fast enough. \u201cYou have to run very fast just to stand still,\u201d Dale says. The global power generation picture is \u201cdepressingly\u201d unchanged from 20 years ago, he says. Three flat lines show an unwavering breakdown of the global electricity mix: last year coal made up 38%, non-fossil fuels reached 36% and the rest of the world\u2019s power was generated by gas and oil. This is the same as in 1998. \u201cIf rising demand was to be met by renewable energy, renewable generation would need to have grown more than twice as quickly over the past three years than it actually did,\u201d Dale says. \u201cAlternatively, the same reduction in carbon emissions could have been achieved by replacing around 10% of coal in the power sector with natural gas.\u201d BP\u2019s backing for gas is unsurprising and self-serving: the company owns a vast portfolio of gas fields, and it plans to expand this within the business as oil falls from favour. It also makes sense: gas generation emits around half the carbon of coal, and avoids much of the air pollution which has become a major concern in Asia\u2019s growing cities. However, gas is still a hydrocarbon and its use cannot grow unchecked within the energy system without driving carbon emissions higher. The demand for gas increased by 5.3% in 2018, one of its strongest growth rates for over 30 years. Its use accounted for 45% of the increase in global energy consumption last year. The gas \u201cbonanza\u201d was led by the US shale boom, says Dale. The US shale heartlands in the Marcellus, Haynesville and Permian basins produced an extra 78 billion cubic metres of gas last year. This is the same growth in one year as the previous 12 combined. The surge in US gas production was used mainly to meet its own booming domestic demand. The US recorded the third-highest growth for energy consumption last year: it is the only G7 nation at the top of the energy growth league table; the rest of the top 10 are developing economies. Dale points to a worrying vicious climate cycle to explain part of the US boom. Research suggests that wider swings in temperature are nudging homes and businesses to turn up either heating systems or air conditioners more often. Last year, the number of particularly hot or cold days in the US was the highest for 50 years. And temperature swings in the first months of 2019 are proving to be just as wide of seasonal norms. This may reflect \u201crandom variation\u201d in weather patterns, says Dale. Or it may signal a worrying climate feedback loop which will make it harder to tackle the climate crisis. \u201cIf there is a link between the growing levels of carbon in the atmosphere and the weather patterns observed in 2018,\u201d he says, \u201cthis would raise the possibility of a vicious cycle: increasing levels of carbon leading to more extreme weather patterns, which in turn trigger stronger growth in energy usage \u2013 and emissions.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s lunchtime on a sunny day in early June. I\u2019m standing on London\u2019s Fleet Street outside an imposing door that\u2019s sandwiched between a solicitor\u2019s office and Ye Olde Cock Tavern. I feel nervous and sticky-palmed. A message pings into my phone. It\u2019s from my 17-year-old daughter. It says: \u201cTry not to worry Dad, it\u2019s only an hour and then it\u2019s over forever, and you never need to do it again. Love you!\u201d I swallow hard and ring the bell. There\u2019s no going back. I\u2019m about to have my first ever singing lesson.</p> <p>In the same way that some people are non-drivers or non-swimmers, I am a non-singer. I do not sing. Other than croaking out Happy Birthday or groaning through the occasional hymn, I just don\u2019t sing. Like so many people, early criticism of my quavering vocals cut me to the quick and turned me into a life-long mimer. My lips move, but the volume is set at zero. Two events stand out. In the first I am seven years old. I\u2019m in the gym and one by one we are summoned to walk across the wooden floor to the music teacher, who sits behind a piano. When we get there she plays two notes and asks which is higher. To me they sound the same. I take a random guess\u2026 and the whole class collapses into hysterics. I walk back across the floor with my cheeks on fire. In the second event, answering the headmaster\u2019s call that the choir needs more members, I join my friends for an open practice session. It\u2019s all very jolly. Half way through Kumbaya My Lord, a teacher puts his hand in the air and melodramatically cries: \u201cHalt!\u201d Has he been wounded? What\u2019s happened? He swivels round slowly and singles me out: \u201cYou! No thank you!\u201d My friends collapse in hysterics once more and my cheeks explode into colour. That\u2019s it, I think, never again.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure why I felt the shame of being a bad singer so acutely. I\u2019m rubbish at all kinds of things. My football, cooking and dancing are all laughable, but I don\u2019t care what anyone else thinks. If they don\u2019t appreciate my aubergine surprise, more fool them. So why am I so stumped by my singing? I once heard a critic describe Bob Dylan\u2019s voice as like a truck reversing out of a gravel pit. And that hasn\u2019t held him back.</p> <p>When I announced my plan to have a singing lesson, I was met with various responses by friends and family. None were positive. One asked what my aim was: \u201cWill you go busking?\u201d she said, before laughing at her comic genius. Another asked me to record a before and after \u2013 rubbing his hands at the aural car crash in store. My wife wondered what I might ask to sing. \u201cHow about La Donna \u00e8 Mobile from Verdi\u2019s <em>Rigoletto</em>?\u201d she joked. Actually, my goal is less lofty. I want to sing a line or two from <em>any</em> song, with no one listening, but in an unselfconscious way. Surely, even for me, that\u2019s achievable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Michael runs his fingers over the piano keys. I think I might faint</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p> I hear someone coming to answer the door. If there is a piano in a small room and the teacher plays a couple of notes, I\u2019ll just walk out. The door swings open and <a href=\"https://www.michaelvickersbaritone.com/\" title=\"\">Michael Vickers</a> greets me with a warm smile. \u201cCome in,\u201d he says, and leads me into a small room with a piano. He runs his fingers over a few keys and I think I might faint. Then, somehow, even I realise this is all quite ridiculous, and I pull myself together.</p> <p>Michael\u2019s students are on the whole not like me. They are, in fact, opera singers. \u201cMostly I work with professionals and ensembles across the UK and Europe,\u201d he says, though he does make the point that he often works with amateurs and teaches a range of styles. If my throat was dry before, it now feels like sandpaper. We get started by tackling the great question that perplexes all non-singers. \u201cNo one is tone deaf,\u201d Michael assures me. \u201cUnless, possibly, you have a hearing impairment. We can all detect shifts in tone and inflection. It\u2019s just a case of learning to recognise that.\u201d Maybe there is hope for me after all, I think, as I shift awkwardly on the piano stool.</p> <p>I\u2019m particularly dreading the moment when I have to open my mouth and go: \u201cLaaaaa.\u201d The prospect feels insurmountable. But Michael outflanks me by getting me to hum first. He plays three ascending notes on the keyboard and then, in his caramelly baritone, sings: \u201cHmmmmmm.\u201d To my amazement I find myself joining in. His voice is so firm and beguiling it\u2019s all I can do not to follow his lead. We go up and down several scales and then he turns to me and says, \u201cThere, that wasn\u2019t so bad, was it?\u201d No, actually, it wasn\u2019t. I quite liked it. How odd.</p> <p>We talk about why people feel so shy about singing. Michael thinks it\u2019s because our voice is so intimately bound up with who we are. \u201cIf people say they don\u2019t like your singing, they are effectively saying they don\u2019t like your voice, which is then the same as saying they don\u2019t like you.\u201d He might be right. I\u2019m a terrible cook, but cooking isn\u2019t me. If you don\u2019t like the slop that I serve up it doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like me.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s why I always start with humming. You are putting less out there so you feel less vulnerable.\u201d He then points out that truly great singers are not so much the ones with the most technically perfect voices but the ones who let their voices be vulnerable. \u201cThink of Adele,\u201d he says, \u201cher emotion is carried through in every note.\u201d It seems bizarre that Michael, my vocal coach as I now think of him, is talking about my singing and Adele\u2019s singing in the <em>same</em> sentence.</p> <p>After more humming and a fun sliding game where we make our voices helter-skelter up and down an imaginary slide, Michael ups the ante by opening his mouth and replacing the hmmmmmm with a teeth-baring eeeeeeee. Up and down we go. My eeeeeees sound good to me and Michael is encouraging. The eeeeeeees give way to babababababas \u2013 they\u2019re great fun, and up and down we go again.</p> <p>We take a break from the scales and Michael explains where people so often go wrong. \u201cWe tend to think that singing requires something different from speaking, so we contort our throats and chests to make the noises we think we should be making. But singing is about communication and emotion, just like speaking is. What we need to try to do is use the same voice for both.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Let\u2019s sing a song,\u2019 says Michael. Panic flutters in my chest</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back to the keyboard, but I\u2019m now feeling pretty cool. I\u2019m beginning to relax. I\u2019m just going to use my speaking voice as my singing voice \u2013 and put like that it suddenly doesn\u2019t seem so daunting. \u201cRight,\u201d says Michael, \u201ctime for some actual words.\u201d We ease ourselves in with some counting: one, two, three, four, five, four, three, two, one. More up and down stuff. Always holding the last note for a few beats. This is my favourite bit so far. I\u2019m wondering where all this is going. In some ways, I think, I\u2019ve mastered this and would now like to quit. I\u2019ll go to weddings and just go bababababa or maybe do some counting and everyone will be happy.</p> <p>Michael has other plans. \u201cI think we should sing a song now,\u201d he says. I am stunned. A song? But what did I think? Singing is for songs. It had to happen. He leafs through a stack of papers. I wonder what he\u2019ll pull out. I\u2019m a big country and western fan, and I\u2019ve always thought Willie Nelson has a shocker of a voice so maybe that would work\u2026 but no, it\u2019s the Beatles. \u201cHow about <em>Yesterday</em>?\u201d Michael suggests. He explains that we tend to sing in either chest voice or head voice \u2013 and men cope better with a chest voice. <em>Yesterday</em> lends itself to that perfectly.</p> <p>I feel the fluttering of panic in my chest. While Michael gets ready at the piano, I clear my throat about six times. Would Adele do that? What about Willie? Michael starts singing and playing the piano. It\u2019s really lovely. I\u2019d like to sit here and just listen to him. After one go through, he nods at me and, to my utter disbelief I hear: \u201cYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away\u201d coming out of my very own throat. I\u2019ve smashed it. I\u2019m not sure what I\u2019ve conquered, but I feel I\u2019ve struggled over some splintery old wooden fence into a bright new place where I can sing \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t matter what it sounds like.</p> <p>I tell Michael he is at this point the first and only person I\u2019ve ever sung in front of in such an earnest way. I\u2019ve astonished myself. He is delighted.</p> <p>Later that day, I cycle home. I reach the top of the long final downhill to where I live. It\u2019s a glorious summer evening and I let the brakes off and freewheel. And as I do, at the top of my lungs, I sing: \u201cYesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away.\u201d</p> <p><em>The London Singing Institute offers lessons and courses in all genres of music in one-to-one and group sessions.

It was once a wimpy bacteria \u2013 mundane and harmless \u2013 but its superpower is its ability to acquire antibiotic-resistant genes. It now <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed\">tops the World Health Organization\u2019s list</a> of the 12 mostly deadly superbugs to human health. It has infiltrated clinics and hospitals all around the world and sticks to hospital linens. Tom likely picked it up in Egypt while we were vacationing there in late 2015 \u2013 sequencing later showed it was an Egyptian strain. He came down in Egypt with what turned out to be acute pancreatitis, caused by a gallstone blocking his bile duct. He could have got [the superbug] from the Egyptian clinic we got him to. It could also have come from the swirling red dust we were exposed to while exploring pyramids \u2013 the pathogen is also found in soil. We really don\u2019t know. But the football-sized cyst that formed in his abdomen as a complication of the gallstone provided a nice little apartment for the superbug to settle in and fester.</p> <p><strong>What is phage therapy and how does it work?</strong><br>Phage therapy is the use of bacteriophages \u2013 viruses that attack bacteria \u2013 to treat infections. There are trillions and trillions of phages on the planet and they have evolved over millennia to become the prefect predators to bacteria. The phage latches on to and enters the bacterial cell where it takes over its machinery and turns it into a phage manufacturing plant. The newly minted phages then burst out and the bacterial cell dies. To work, phages have to be matched to the bacterial infection. But just how close the match needs to be depends on the bacterial species.</p> <p><strong>Phage therapy has been neglected in the </strong><strong>west. Why?</strong><br>Phages were first discovered in 1917 by a French-Canadian, F\u00e9lix d\u2019Herelle, but he had a hard time getting his work accepted \u2013 he wasn\u2019t formally trained and was considered a vagabond scholar. Then, while phage preparations were being manufactured in the west up until the late 1930s, the scientific method hadn\u2019t really been worked out. They were, for example, not being matched to specific bacteria and they were sold without being purified, so some actually could cause harm. After penicillin came to market in the early 1940s, phage therapy fell out of favour and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/09/cold-war-politics-hampered-life-saving-phage-therapy-research\">political reasons kept it there</a>. Former Soviet countries \u2013 where penicillin wasn\u2019t so consistently available \u2013 had taken up phage therapy very vigorously. Western researchers and companies feared being labelled \u201cpinko commie\u201d sympathisers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Luckily the navy found a phage that would match in the murky waters of a sewage treatment</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You got Tom out of Egypt and eventually into </strong><strong>intensive care at your institution, UCSD. What turned you on to phage therapy and where did you find Tom\u2019s phages?</strong><br>We were running out of options to save Tom, whose infection had spread throughout his body, so I started exploring unconventional cures. I found a paper that mentioned phage therapy. Although I\u2019d learned of phages in college, this was the first I had heard of using them as a treatment. My colleague Chip Schooley, chief of infectious diseases at the UCSD school of medicine, agreed it was an interesting idea and said if I could find phages that matched Tom\u2019s bacterial infection he would contact the Food and Drug Administration and get approval to use them for compassionate use. I knew what that meant: officially, Tom was dying.</p> <p>I began cold-emailing phage researchers asking for help. A phage researcher at Texas A&amp;M University turned his lab into a kind of command centre, looking for phages active against Tom\u2019s specific infection in his centre\u2019s phage library and in sewage and barnyard waste \u2013 wherever you find a lot of bacteria is where you find the phages that kill them! He also wrote to researchers all over the world asking them to send any phages they had that might work, which they did. But phages for <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em> are very picky. Tom\u2019s life depended on finding a match in time. In three weeks, which included a week spent on purification, a cocktail of four phages was ready to give to Tom. The navy \u2013 who our FDA contact also put us in touch with \u2013 produced a second four-phage cocktail from their phage library.</p> <p><strong>Did it work at once?</strong><br>We began the intravenous phage therapy, but Tom\u2019s bacteria quickly became resistant to all the phages except one in the navy\u2019s cocktail. We didn\u2019t realise that a lot of the phages across both cocktails were very similar to one another and were all trying to enter the bacteria by the same receptor. The bacteria\u2019s successful attempt at evading one phage therefore offered resistance to the rest. Luckily, looking again for more phages that would match, the navy found another in the murky waters of a sewage treatment plant in Maryland. From bog to bedside, so we say! It was powerful because it hit a different receptor. Coincidentally, we found there was synergy with one of the antibiotics Tom was getting. Tom woke up three days after we began the treatment and he fully cleared his infection within three months.</p> <p><strong>How did Tom\u2019s case break new medical ground?</strong><br>He was the first in the US to get intravenous phage therapy for a systemic superbug infection. In the past when phage therapy has been used, it has usually been topically \u2013 sprinkled on somebody\u2019s skin \u2013 or inhaled with a nebuliser. Going intravenous was really risky. Even in the former Soviet countries, where phage therapy has been used for decades, they don\u2019t often treat intravenously because they don\u2019t have the hi-tech capability to purify their phage of the bacterial debris that accumulates when you prepare them in large quantities, so there\u2019s the risk of septic shock. We think of what Tom received as 21st-century phage therapy.</p> <p><strong>Since Tom\u2019s case, you have assisted other patients to get phage therapy and you now, in addition to your day job, co-direct a new phage therapy centre at UCSD \u2013 the Centre for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics \u2013 the first in North America. How many people have you helped to date?</strong><br>After Tom\u2019s case was publicised, people contacted me from all over the world wanting phage therapy. Strangers had helped us, and I felt I had an obligation to help them. So far, we\u2019ve treated six other patients here at UCSD, and advised on a couple of dozen cases elsewhere across the US and internationally. We haven\u2019t always been successful, because sometimes we have been contacted too late. But the FDA is now making it easier for people to get phage therapy earlier in the course of their infections. What\u2019s needed now are clinical trials to see if it works on a broader scale.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/10/antibiotic-resistance-phages-gm-virus-isabelle-holdaway-drugs\">The race to beat antibiotic resistance is on \u2013 so where do phages fit in? | Richard James</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>I understand your centre helped in the case reported last month of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/08/teenager-recovers-from-near-death-in-world-first-gm-virus-treatment\" title=\"\">the British teenager Isabelle Holdaway</a>. She became the first person to be treated successfully with a genetically modified phage for a superbug infection following a double lung transplant.</strong><br>Her mother had heard about Tom\u2019s case and asked her UK doctor whether he could consider phage therapy. He contacted Schooley, the doctor who ended up treated Tom and now co-directs the centre with me. Isabelle\u2019s infection \u2013 <em>Mycobacterium abscessus</em> \u2013 is in the same genus as tuberculosis and was fully resistant to antibiotics. She was receiving hospice care. The team asked a researcher with a mycobacterium phage library at the University of Pittsburgh to help, but most of the phages he found that matched were not predatory enough. So they tweaked one genetically \u2013 clipping out a gene \u2013 to ensure it killed the bacteria rather than going dormant. The phage was administered intravenously, like with Tom, and Isabelle left the hospital in a week. I wept for joy. Isabelle is now finishing her A-levels and learning to drive.</p> <p><strong>Even if phage therapy is proven to work, is widespread use ever going to be achievable when it is essentially personalised therapy? How does it scale up?</strong><br>What is needed are readily available phages to match whatever organisms we face in the bacterial world. Instead of having to resort to environmental sources every time \u2013 like we did in Tom\u2019s case with the sewage \u2013 imagine a large, ever-expanding, open-source phage library that researchers and students contribute to from around the world, which could be accessible globally as a resource. Genetic tweaking is also clearly a way of expanding the range of bacteria that picky phages like Tom\u2019s or Isabelle\u2019s are able to attack.</p> <p><strong>What about the problem of the bacteria becoming phage-resistant?</strong><br>Bacterial resistance to phage can be expected, but how quickly it occurs depends on a number of factors. In Tom\u2019s case, it emerged fast. Isabelle has been treated for about a year and resistance hasn\u2019t emerged yet, since her bacteria is slow-growing. And there are a few ways that issue can be overcome, like using a phage cocktail where different phages \u201chit\u201d different bacterial receptors. In the future, genetically modified or synthetic phages could be developed that are harder for bacterial resistance to overcome.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your advice to people who do find their loved ones hospitali</strong><strong>sed with superbug infections? Shout for phage therapy?</strong><br>For any serious illness, you need to be an advocate. Get educated about what\u2019s going on and be actively involved in your loved one\u2019s care. In the case of a superbug, understand what options are left in terms of antibiotics and also what kinds of side effects exist, because some last-resort antibiotics, like colistin, can be very hard on the body. Because phage therapy is experimental, you can\u2019t necessarily get it if there are still antibiotic options available. If there are not, phage therapy may be possible. <a href=\"https://profiles.ucsd.edu/steffanie.strathdee\" title=\"\">Email us</a>.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-perfect-predator-a-scientist-s-race-to-save-her-husband-9780316418089.html\">The Perfect Predator</a> is published by Hachette Books (\u00a320)</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A retired high court judge will preside over a hearing into allegations of \u201cimmoral, scandalous or disgraceful\u201d conduct by the dean of Christ Church, Oxford, which are believed to relate to a dispute over pay and governance at the ancient college. Sir Andrew Smith will assess claims made against the Very Rev Martyn Percy, suspended from his job since last September. The hearing, to be held in private, is expected to last eight days and is estimated to cost at least \u00a3500,000. Although details of the complaints against Percy have not been disclosed, the college told alumni in a letter in January that the row related to pay. Percy, who has not commented on the dispute, is believed to earn about \u00a390,000 a year plus accommodation and generous perks \u2013 relatively low compared with other college heads. Percy also heads Christ Church cathedral. He has strong support from within the Church of England and from some Oxford college heads, but a group within Christ Church\u2019s governing body is thought to be firmly opposed to his efforts at modernisation. The Charity Commission, which has oversight of Christ Church and other Oxford colleges, has said it was aware of \u201cissues around the governance and leadership\u201d at the college. Christ Church, founded by Henry VIII in 1546, is the alma mater of 13 British prime ministers, 10 chancellors of the exchequer and 17 archbishops. It is one of Oxford\u2019s richest colleges, with funds of more than \u00a3500m. Percy has been dean since 2014. Under the college\u2019s statutes, there are limited circumstances in which the dean can be removed. These include persistent failure or neglect of duties; being convicted of an offence that renders the dean unfit for office; physical or mental incapacity; and behaviour of an \u201cimmoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Life is easy for the toads and bats of Staines-upon-Thames: the disused railway line has formed a woodland corridor that runs north towards Heathrow. Terminal 5 is just a mile or so further on as the bat flies. But to reach it from Staines station would take a hapless rail passenger almost two hours via three trains.</p> <p>That could drop to just six minutes under plans to link Staines and other parts of Surrey to the airport. Yet as Heathrow prepares for a major consultation on its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/heathrow-third-runway\" title=\"\">third runway</a> on Tuesday, new rail links are just an option, despite the argument that they would help tackle the airport\u2019s pollution problem. They would also be a clear answer to transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s call for \u201cmarket-led\u201d proposals for new railway lines.</p> <p>As a precondition of Heathrow expansion, parliament has stipulated that the proportion of passengers travelling to and from the airport on public transport must rise from 39% to 50%. The Department for Transport officially supports the idea of a rail link, and says it is \u201cworking closely with interested parties to progress this project\u201d. Yet the promoters believe the schemes \u2013 a light rail plan favoured by Staines council, as well as fully integrated rail lines \u2013 have been left languishing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/heathrowlinks-zip/giv-3902Cle5Pfkka8v6/\" data-alt=\"staines graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/heathrowlinks-zip/giv-3902Cle5Pfkka8v6/\">staines graphic</a> </figure>  <p>Graham Cross, chief executive of Heathrow Southern Railway (HSRL), one of the proposed schemes, is frustrated. \u201cGrayling was talking about the market coming up with ideas. Investors were interested. Now we\u2019ve had six months of drift.\u201d</p> <p>Cross says HSRL, which is backed by US firm Aecom, doesn\u2019t need government money for its \u00a31.3bn-\u00a31.6bn proposal. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe DfT does have to facilitate it.\u201d That means a pledge that rail franchises will deliver a certain number of services to Heathrow using their line.</p> <p>Standing on a bridge over the existing line from Waterloo to Windsor, Cross points to where the offshoot would go, curving round the perimeter of Staines Moor, a site of special scientific interest, into a tunnel.</p> <p>The plan would, he concedes, eat up a stretch of field, and require demolition of one house and its surrounding willow trees. But the soundtrack to this bucolic scene is the extraordinary roar of the M25, at this point 12 lanes of thundering traffic, directly behind where Cross is standing.</p> <p>The line running north-west from Staines was closed in the Beeching cuts and then severed by the motorway. A new link could switch three million car journeys a year to rail, \u201cimproving air quality and reducing congestion here, and bringing more jobs and investment to a town that could use a boost\u201d, according to Cross.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just Staines: the extension would link the airport directly to towns such as Woking, Basingstoke and Guildford, as well as London Waterloo via Clapham Junction.</p> <p>Heathrow agrees that the economic and environmental benefits are clear. A spokeswoman said: \u201cHeathrow is keen that this project is moved forward at the earliest opportunity, and we will pay our share towards the cost.\u201d</p> <p>But the airport is fighting shy. One reason is evident in faded signs in the woods, telling visitors about the wildlife on the former railway. They note plans by BAA, as Heathrow\u2019s owner was then known, to reopen the line as Airtrack. The scheme went as far as public consultation in 2008, but when the original third runway plan was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/may/24/third-runway-heathrow-scrapped-baa\" title=\"\">scrapped in 2010</a>, Airtrack died too.</p> <p>Still, an empty space for a station stands under Terminal 5, built in readiness for future rail links. Another part of the equation could come first: a four-mile link to the Great Western mainline, planned by Network Rail to take passengers travelling from the west to Heathrow without going into London Paddington.</p> <p>Regardless, Heathrow must now convince planners that upgrades of the Piccadilly line and the eventual opening of Crossrail will meet the public transport target \u2013 along with a congestion charge on cars to encourage a \u201cmodal shift\u201d. Critics, however, believe that the charge would need to exceed \u00a340 to deter motorists.</p> <p>Heathrow\u2019s 12-week public consultation starts this week, outlining in detail its expansion masterplan. Over it now looms the fresh spectre of cancellation under a Boris Johnson premiership \u2013 although many expect him to shelve past opposition to the third runway. Either way, with green issues returning to the fore, investors will look to see whether the DfT will help make the rail link a reality.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Life is easy for the toads and bats of Staines-upon-Thames: the disused railway line has formed a woodland corridor that runs north towards Heathrow. Terminal 5 is just a mile or so further on as the bat flies. But to reach it from Staines station would take a hapless rail passenger almost two hours via three trains. That could drop to just six minutes under plans to link Staines and other parts of Surrey to the airport. Yet as Heathrow prepares for a major consultation on its third runway on Tuesday, new rail links are just an option, despite the argument that they would help tackle the airport\u2019s pollution problem. They would also be a clear answer to transport secretary Chris Grayling\u2019s call for \u201cmarket-led\u201d proposals for new railway lines. As a precondition of Heathrow expansion, parliament has stipulated that the proportion of passengers travelling to and from the airport on public transport must rise from 39% to 50%. The Department for Transport officially supports the idea of a rail link, and says it is \u201cworking closely with interested parties to progress this project\u201d. Yet the promoters believe the schemes \u2013 a light rail plan favoured by Staines council, as well as fully integrated rail lines \u2013 have been left languishing. Graham Cross, chief executive of Heathrow Southern Railway (HSRL), one of the proposed schemes, is frustrated. \u201cGrayling was talking about the market coming up with ideas. Investors were interested. Now we\u2019ve had six months of drift.\u201d Cross says HSRL, which is backed by US firm Aecom, doesn\u2019t need government money for its \u00a31.3bn-\u00a31.6bn proposal. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe DfT does have to facilitate it.\u201d That means a pledge that rail franchises will deliver a certain number of services to Heathrow using their line. Standing on a bridge over the existing line from Waterloo to Windsor, Cross points to where the offshoot would go, curving round the perimeter of Staines Moor, a site of special scientific interest, into a tunnel. The plan would, he concedes, eat up a stretch of field, and require demolition of one house and its surrounding willow trees. But the soundtrack to this bucolic scene is the extraordinary roar of the M25, at this point 12 lanes of thundering traffic, directly behind where Cross is standing. The line running north-west from Staines was closed in the Beeching cuts and then severed by the motorway. A new link could switch three million car journeys a year to rail, \u201cimproving air quality and reducing congestion here, and bringing more jobs and investment to a town that could use a boost\u201d, according to Cross. And it\u2019s not just Staines: the extension would link the airport directly to towns such as Woking, Basingstoke and Guildford, as well as London Waterloo via Clapham Junction. Heathrow agrees that the economic and environmental benefits are clear. A spokeswoman said: \u201cHeathrow is keen that this project is moved forward at the earliest opportunity, and we will pay our share towards the cost.\u201d But the airport is fighting shy. One reason is evident in faded signs in the woods, telling visitors about the wildlife on the former railway. They note plans by BAA, as Heathrow\u2019s owner was then known, to reopen the line as Airtrack. The scheme went as far as public consultation in 2008, but when the original third runway plan was scrapped in 2010, Airtrack died too. Still, an empty space for a station stands under Terminal 5, built in readiness for future rail links. Another part of the equation could come first: a four-mile link to the Great Western mainline, planned by Network Rail to take passengers travelling from the west to Heathrow without going into London Paddington. Regardless, Heathrow must now convince planners that upgrades of the Piccadilly line and the eventual opening of Crossrail will meet the public transport target \u2013 along with a congestion charge on cars to encourage a \u201cmodal shift\u201d. Critics, however, believe that the charge would need to exceed \u00a340 to deter motorists. Heathrow\u2019s 12-week public consultation starts this week, outlining in detail its expansion masterplan. Over it now looms the fresh spectre of cancellation under a Boris Johnson premiership \u2013 although many expect him to shelve past opposition to the third runway. Either way, with green issues returning to the fore, investors will look to see whether the DfT will help make the rail link a reality.",

The \u201cBasic Law\u201d constitution guarantees to protect, for the next 50 years, the democratic institutions that make&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;distinct from Communist-ruled mainland China.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2003:&nbsp;</b>Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s leaders introduce legislation that would forbid acts of treason and subversion against the Chinese government. The bill resembles laws used to charge dissidents on the mainland. An estimated half a million people turn out to protest against the bill. As a result of the backlash, further action on the proposal is halted.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2007:&nbsp;</b>The Basic Law stated that the ultimate aim was for&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s voters to achieve a complete democracy, but China decides in 2007 that universal suffrage in elections for the chief executive cannot be implemented until 2017. Some lawmakers are chosen by business and trade groups, while others are elected by vote. In a bid to accelerate a decision on universal suffrage, five lawmakers resign. But this act is followed by the adoption of the Beijing-backed electoral changes, which expand the chief executive\u2019s selection committee and add more seats for lawmakers elected by direct vote. The legislation divides Hong&nbsp;Kong's pro-democracy camp, as some support the reforms while others say they will only delay full democracy while reinforcing a structure that favors Beijing.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2014:&nbsp;</b>The Chinese government introduces a bill allowing Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;residents to vote for their leader in 2017, but with one major caveat: the candidates must be approved by Beijing. Pro-democracy lawmakers are incensed by the bill, which they call an example of \u201cfake universal suffrage\u201d and \u201cfake democracy\u201d. The move triggers a massive protest as crowds occupy some of&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong\u2019s most crowded districts for 70 days. In June 2015,&nbsp;Hong&nbsp;Kong&nbsp;legislators formally reject the bill, and electoral reform stalls. The current chief executive, Carrie Lam, widely seen as the Chinese Communist party\u2019s favoured candidate, is hand-picked in 2017 by a 1,200-person committee dominated by pro-Beijing elites.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p><b>2019:&nbsp;</b>Lam pushes amendments to extradition laws that would allow people to be sent to mainland China to face charges. The proposed legislation triggers a huge protest, with organisers putting the turnout at 1 million, and a standoff that forces the legislature to postpone debate on the bills. After weeks of protest, often meeting with violent reprisals from the Hong Kong police, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/04/hong-kong-lam-to-withdraw-extradition-bill-say-reports\">Lam announced that she would withdraw the bill</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>To a barrage of questions on whether she should resign over her decision to carry on pushing the bill despite the million-strong protest last Sunday, Lam adopted a defiant tone, stressing that she had served Hong Kong for 40 years and would continue to \u201cuse my experience to create a better future\u201d.</p> \n<p>She thanked the pro-government legislators and those who had supported the bill, but did not mention her political opponents and citizens who had blocked it, and emphasised that it had only been suspended to restore peace.</p> \n<p>The press conference was stopped abruptly after 90 minutes; Lam simply walked out, ignoring dozens of journalists who continued to shout out questions.</p>",

In addition, I am so thankful to the emergency services and everyone at Roanne Hospital who assisted and stabilised me, as well as the surgeons, doctors and nurses at the University Hospital of St Etienne, who have really gone above and beyond the call of duty, for which I am ever so grateful.\u201d Froome took his hand off his handlebars to blow his nose before a gust of wind destabilised his bike. He crashed into a wall and lost consciousness. The Briton was airlifted to hospital where he has since been joined by his wife Michelle. Meanwhile, Wout Poels gave Team Ineos something to celebrate by winning stage seven of the Dauphin\u00e9, as Britain\u2019s Adam Yates lost his grip on the overall lead. The Dutchman let out a huge roar as he won on the Montee de Pipay, having bridged across to leading duo Jakob Fuglsang and Emanuel Buchmann in the last kilometre before beating the pair to the finish line. Astana\u2019s Fuglsang did enough to claim the yellow jersey from Yates, who will start Sunday\u2019s final stage with an eight-second disadvantage. Poels\u2019s first stage victory of the year moved him up to fifth, 28 seconds behind Fuglsang. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice for the team and it\u2019s a gift for Chris also,\u201d said Poels. \u201cI felt pretty strong all day. The team did an amazing job.\u201d Speaking to Eurosport, Poels added: \u201cI hope he watches this one, it was really for Chris, especially with what happened this week. [It\u2019s] really nice for the team and I also hope it gives Chris strength to be come really strong back.\u201d",

They more than likely will play on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The Colombian hotshots won in Barcelona and Rome, reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros and are leading the race to London for the ATP World Tour Finals. It will not be a quiet hit in the park for Murray who is returning to the game after four months out, recovering from his second hip surgery.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/10/boris-becker-mens-under-28s-wimbledon-big-three-over-30s\">Boris Becker: we should question the quality and attitude of the under-28 men</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Watching Murray and L\u00f3pez work out at Queen\u2019s this week was the defending Fever-Tree tournament singles champion, Marin Cilic, and he had words of encouragement and caution for the Scot. \u201cHe was hitting with Feliciano, just practising,\u201d the Croat said. \u201cI was watching from over two courts away.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe was hitting incredibly cleanly and really well. I didn\u2019t see much moving. The question is always with the movement, especially on grass, a little bit difficult. But if he\u2019s in the tournament, he definitely must feel OK.\u201d</p> \n<p>Cilic, struggling with form this summer and who will have problems of his own in the first round against the fast-rising Chilean Cristian Gar\u00edn, added: \u201cI was talking a little bit with him at the Australian Open [where Murray last played, losing in the first round in five tough sets against Roberto Bautista Agut] and wishing him all the best for his recovery, hoping to see him back as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s been an incredible figure for our sport for so many years, especially here in England. It\u2019s incredible to see him back. I\u2019m just hoping his recovery is going to go even better and better and that he\u2019s going to be feeling really well. Hopefully, he will also continue to play at a high level.\u201d</p> \n<p>Hope is in the air, then. What Murray will not know until he gets into the contest is how his rebuilt body will react to the unscripted pressure of match conditions on a surface that can be hazardous if damp. The forecast is good for the first few days of the week, so the surface should have calmed down by midweek.</p> \n<p>Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, who plays the young Canadian Denis Shapovalov in the first round, says Murray \u201chas nothing to lose\u201d. The Argentinian, who knows more about injuries than your local A&amp;E department, said: \u201cIf he plays a tennis match without pain, it will be even bigger than winning a tournament.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f3a44473-9a59-456d-a377-fe5a2e800b31\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q9buPHKXgx8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>After Queen\u2019s, Murray wants to further explore the state of his recovery by playing in Eastbourne before contemplating a return to Wimbledon, although it is uncertain if L\u00f3pez will be able to accompany him, given he is unsure if he has to qualify for the singles there. The All England Club could cooperate by giving the Spaniard a wildcard, even though Murray says he will happily play with any of a few non-specialists he has spoken to about doubles.</p> \n<p>If the chosen player were to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/16/roger-federer-rafael-nadal-italian-open-tennis\" title=\"\">Nick Kyrgios</a>, they would pack any court on which they appeared, perhaps for not all the right reasons. The Australian refused this week to row back on recent attacks on \u201ccringeworthy\u201d Novak Djokovic and \u201csuper-salty\u201d Rafael Nadal. \u201cA couple of people have loved it actually,\u201d he said at the Surbiton tournament. \u201cI\u2019m not going to mention names but, regardless if people like it or don\u2019t like it, they were just my honest thoughts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kyrgios, whose motivation dips and soars like a hawk, plays France\u2019s Adrian Mannarino in the first round, in the same quarter as the first seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has drawn the British No 1, Kyle Edmund. Dan Evans, who has been in sparkling form, will need to be at his best in his opening match against Stan Wawrinka.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Rarely can a doubles draw have attracted so much interest as the one at the Queen\u2019s Club in London on Saturday and, when the balls of fate dropped, Andy Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez were matched against the best team in the world, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah. They more than likely will play on Wednesday. The Colombian hotshots won in Barcelona and Rome, reached the semi-finals at Roland Garros and are leading the race to London for the ATP World Tour Finals. It will not be a quiet hit in the park for Murray who is returning to the game after four months out, recovering from his second hip surgery. Watching Murray and L\u00f3pez work out at Queen\u2019s this week was the defending Fever-Tree tournament singles champion, Marin Cilic, and he had words of encouragement and caution for the Scot. \u201cHe was hitting with Feliciano, just practising,\u201d the Croat said. \u201cI was watching from over two courts away. \u201cHe was hitting incredibly cleanly and really well. I didn\u2019t see much moving. The question is always with the movement, especially on grass, a little bit difficult. But if he\u2019s in the tournament, he definitely must feel OK.\u201d Cilic, struggling with form this summer and who will have problems of his own in the first round against the fast-rising Chilean Cristian Gar\u00edn, added: \u201cI was talking a little bit with him at the Australian Open [where Murray last played, losing in the first round in five tough sets against Roberto Bautista Agut] and wishing him all the best for his recovery, hoping to see him back as quickly as possible. \u201cHe\u2019s been an incredible figure for our sport for so many years, especially here in England. It\u2019s incredible to see him back. I\u2019m just hoping his recovery is going to go even better and better and that he\u2019s going to be feeling really well. Hopefully, he will also continue to play at a high level.\u201d Hope is in the air, then. What Murray will not know until he gets into the contest is how his rebuilt body will react to the unscripted pressure of match conditions on a surface that can be hazardous if damp. The forecast is good for the first few days of the week, so the surface should have calmed down by midweek. Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro, who plays the young Canadian Denis Shapovalov in the first round, says Murray \u201chas nothing to lose\u201d. The Argentinian, who knows more about injuries than your local A&amp;E department, said: \u201cIf he plays a tennis match without pain, it will be even bigger than winning a tournament.\u201d After Queen\u2019s, Murray wants to further explore the state of his recovery by playing in Eastbourne before contemplating a return to Wimbledon, although it is uncertain if L\u00f3pez will be able to accompany him, given he is unsure if he has to qualify for the singles there. The All England Club could cooperate by giving the Spaniard a wildcard, even though Murray says he will happily play with any of a few non-specialists he has spoken to about doubles. If the chosen player were to be Nick Kyrgios, they would pack any court on which they appeared, perhaps for not all the right reasons. The Australian refused this week to row back on recent attacks on \u201ccringeworthy\u201d Novak Djokovic and \u201csuper-salty\u201d Rafael Nadal. \u201cA couple of people have loved it actually,\u201d he said at the Surbiton tournament. \u201cI\u2019m not going to mention names but, regardless if people like it or don\u2019t like it, they were just my honest thoughts.\u201d Kyrgios, whose motivation dips and soars like a hawk, plays France\u2019s Adrian Mannarino in the first round, in the same quarter as the first seed, Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has drawn the British No 1, Kyle Edmund. Dan Evans, who has been in sparkling form, will need to be at his best in his opening match against Stan Wawrinka.",

There\u2019s a boudoir-aesthetic space called the Love hotel \u2013 previously an art installation with film screenings; it\u2019s now seemingly a whole area. Camping is free, with a limited number of hotel rooms for tent-phobes. Try this if you like: Experimental festivals like Unsound in Poland, CTM in Berlin or Notting Hill carnival sound systems in London. Llandudno jazz festival Bodafom Farm Park, Llandudno, 26-28 July The vibe A bucolic display of some of the UK jazz scene\u2019s stalwarts and rising stars, set against the backdrop of the north Wales coastline. Expect daytime discoveries and late-night jam sessions.

Look out for\u2026 Dean Masser\u2019s tribute to bebop saxophone pioneer Dexter Gordon and an innovative sponsorship scheme: the public can pledge money towards booking new acts. What else? There\u2019s ample time to have an ice-cream on the beach at Llandudno, or explore the nearby Great Orme Country Park and Conwy Castle. Try this if you like\u2026 Cheltenham jazz festival, North Sea Jazz in Rotterdam, or Jazzkaar in Tallinn. AK Houghton festival Houghton Hall, King\u2019s Lynn, Norfolk, 8-11 Aug The vibe A woodland hideaway featuring everything electronic from Detroit techno to Chicago house, footwork and drum\u2019n\u2019bass, curated by longtime Fabric resident Craig Richards. The crowd LSD-microdosing 90s ravers meet university students on summer break. See the performers pop up in the crowd and expect glitter, faux fur and bucket hats.

Look out for\u2026 The man with perhaps the best name (and selection of rare electro) in the game, Intergalactic Gary; trumpeter Matthew Halsall; rising techno producer Bruce. What else? At a festival with a 24-hour music licence, making time for some wellness is key. Houghton has a selection of yoga classes, a woodland sauna, and even a massage parlour on site. Try this if you like\u2026 Fabric pre-2016 closure, Dimensions festival in Croatia, or London\u2019s Field Day. AK We Out Here Abbots Ripton, Cambridgeshire, 15-18 Aug The vibe New Gilles Peterson-curated festival where you can hobnob with the stars of the UK jazz scene and leftfield clubs, but in a field instead of south London. The crowd Younger than you\u2019d think, refreshingly diverse and better dressed than your average jazz fan: think African prints, berets and 90s sportswear. The main events A multigenerational mix of big bands and club DJs, from US saxophonist Gary Bartz and Deptford collective Steam Down to house overlord Theo Parrish and Berlin beatsmith Objekt. Look out for\u2026 Rising electro-popper Charlotte Adig\u00e9ry, returning post-punkers Maximum Joy and party selectors from Worldwide FM \u2013 it\u2019s not just improv jamming that\u2019s catered for here. What else? East London gem Brawn is one of the gourmet restaurants on site. They\u2019ll be serving snacks and natural wine till late, which means you might end up not seeing much music after all. Try this if you like\u2026 Arguing over whether A Love Supreme is superior to The Shape of Jazz to Come and settling it via dance-off. KH Beautiful Days Escot Park, Devon, 16-18 Aug The vibe A late 80s folk-punk Glastonbury, plus kids: this is the festival run by the Levellers, all grown up.

JR ArcTanGent Fernhill Farm, Bristol, 15-17 Aug The vibe Download festival may be the daddy of rock and metal, but this small Bristol weekender offers heavy beats across genres including experimental emo, druidy drone or searing post-rock. The crowd Don\u2019t let the men with black T-shirts, lumber jackets and stern looks fool you: this is a fest for feminist math-rockers, sensitive moshers, craft ale appreciators and anyone with a beard. The main events Big-haired shredders Coheed and Cambria and \u201cblack metal bluesman\u201d Zeal &amp; Ardor will play on Friday; Battles, Russian Circles and 65DaysOfStatic provide expansive noise on Saturday. Look out for\u2026 Cocaine Piss, Mammoth Weed Wizard Bastard, Colossal Squid and plenty more bands who sound like they picked their name from a Cards Against Humanity randomiser. What else? ArcTanGent is more music-focused than most \u2013 the closest it gets to gentrified festival fare is local beer and glamping options \u2013 but it does offer a late-night silent disco till 3am. Try this if you like\u2026 Whiplash and more time-signature changes than there are portable toilets. KH The Delaware Road New Zealand Farm Camp, Wiltshire, 17-18 Aug The vibe Occult folk horror atmospheres inspired by landscape and myth, with music, film and art to match, inside a secret military base on Salisbury Plain. The crowd Radiophonic Workshop obsessives, experimental electronica fans, and Wicker Man extras. The main events Musicians and DJs ( DJ Food, Warp\u2019s Andrea Parker, snooker champ turned feted prog DJ Steve Davis) tell the story of Alan Gubby\u2019s cult novel The Delaware Road, a fantastical alternative vision of late 20th-century Britain.

Look out for\u2026 Underground favourites such as Charlotte Adig\u00e9ry and James Holden &amp; the Animal Spirits; feasts provided by Indian restaurant chain Dishoom. What else? With a focus on wellness, there\u2019s lakeside yoga, creative workshops and an extensive vegan menu (we\u2019ve heard great things about the vegan waffles). Try this if you like\u2026 splitting your time at Glastonbury between the Healing Field and the south-east corner. TJ Field Maneuvers Secret outdoor location, 30 Aug-1 Sep The vibe Frenzied excitement: only 800 attendees and a selection of the world\u2019s finest headline DJ talent. For fans of the music first and foremost. The crowd A joyous mix of techno-heads, aspiring DJs scrutinising setlists and older ravers. Not for profit, so all involved just want to stage a great party. The main events Cult house DJ the Black Madonna brings her ecstatic vinyl sets, while New York\u2019s Umfang and Paris\u2019s Teki Latex cover the heavier end of the spectrum. Look out for\u2026 Bristol\u2019s punk-cum-techno duo Giant Swan for shirtless electronics, rising techno turntablist Or:la, and what promises to be a mind-melting jungle set from Mark Archer and Hectick.

      "body": "<p>When Belgian architect Ewald Van Der Straeten discovered a flat for sale in east London\u2019s Trevelyan House in 2012, he jumped at the chance to view it, and then put in an offer the very next day. \u201cMy big dream would have been to live in a Barbican apartment. I love the robust beauty of the concrete and the well-proportioned interiors,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was pure luck that I found a flat in this building; it has many of the qualities I was seeking, which you just don\u2019t find in the majority of new builds.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1246883\" title=\"\">Trevelyan House</a> was built in 1958 by Sir Denys Lasdun, the British architect behind the National Theatre\u2019s boldly Brutalist design. Lasdun devised the then radical idea of a butterfly plan, which saw the rear unit on each floor of this block of flats set at right angles to the other two, with a central core containing the stairs and lift. Not only did this improve the aspect of each apartment, it also negated the need for long access corridors and gave residents more privacy while maintaining a neighbourly atmosphere. Its \u201ccluster block\u201d design allowed for 24 new residences to be created on a relatively small Second World War bomb site in Bethnal Green, without disturbing the existing character of the street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d31ff49aef2dad505735d176bab55ecb36e59fb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d31ff49aef2dad505735d176bab55ecb36e59fb1/0_667_7296_4378/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The living area, with grey sofa and multi-coloured cushions\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour splashes: the living area, with sofa by Innovation Living.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While Ewald was instantly enamoured of the thoughtfully configured flat, his fianc\u00e9e, opera singer Louise Lloyd, took a little longer to adjust to life in the grey and boxy 1950s block. \u201cWhen we started dating I was living in a modern apartment building in west London, just minutes from Hyde Park, which I loved,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt really was a testament to our relationship that I gave that up to move in here with Ewald. I didn\u2019t have a huge appreciation for the architecture at that point, and I found the block a little unattractive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was pure luck that I found a flat in this building; it has many qualities you don\u2019t find in new builds</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They now share their two-bedroom Bethnal Green maisonette with their baby daughter, Maya. With its open-plan living area and split-level layout, the flat works extremely well for the young family, even though Ewald initially designed it for himself and a housemate. This is thanks to a considered remodel, which saw the original series of compartmentalised spaces reworked into a fluid, more functional floor plan.</p> <p>Ewald enlisted fellow architect George Bradley, long-time friend and co-founder of the pair\u2019s studio, Bradley Van Der Straeten Architects, to help with the project. Together, the duo came up with a \u201croom-within-a-room\u201d concept for the lower level, where the kitchen is conceived as a separate cube slotted into the living area. As well as zoning the space, the design is an ingenious response to building regulations, which prevented Ewald from removing the interior walls.</p> <p>The cube itself is built from Plyboo, a sustainable material made from sheets of bamboo \u2013 it looks like oak but is stronger and more affordable. The exterior is clad in dark grey MDF (made using a coloured resin rather than from painted MDF), applied as panels to create the impression of a box rather than a partition wall. Shadow gaps also add to this effect \u2013 a trick borrowed from the ancient Egyptians \u2013 which can be seen where the structure meets the floor and the ceiling.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2da22b0e86a12c8e3b7a276c7d83696556a4851f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2da22b0e86a12c8e3b7a276c7d83696556a4851f/0_1938_5809_3485/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ewald and Louise with baby Maya.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family living: Ewald and Louise with baby Maya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The work was undertaken in two stages: the upper floor was remodelled in just six weeks, and then, a year later, it took two months to complete the lower level. \u201cThe design took longer, of course,\u201d adds Ewald. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare as an architect that you get the chance to do your own house up, but we were lucky to have some extra resources at the studio to help, so I took a long time to plan what I wanted to do.\u201d</p> <p>To complement the building\u2019s architectural origins, Ewald originally decorated the interior with pops of primary colour and a mix of midcentury furniture. Louise has since added a few flourishes of her own, which required patience and a little persuasiveness on her part. \u201cEwald was a bit protective over the flat,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe saw it quite differently to how I did, and it took a couple of years to come to a compromise that suited both of us.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87c0c4ebf9fd1d43934ee1415d9497ddec9bff97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87c0c4ebf9fd1d43934ee1415d9497ddec9bff97/0_4288_6667_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue and yellow in the bedroom.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sweet dreams: blue and yellow in the bedroom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rachael Smith/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Love won out and now the home is a happy mix of both their tastes, with Ewald\u2019s modernist pieces sitting comfortably alongside Louise\u2019s cheerful tonal colour and tactile fabrics. \u201cEverything we have now has been a joint decision \u2013 even the cushions,\u201d says Louise, who has come to appreciate why Ewald was so drawn to the space to begin with. \u201cLiving in a maisonette feels almost like a small house, so it\u2019s never claustrophobic, plus there\u2019s always so much light coming in. The way Ewald redesigned the flat is really clever, and I now have a much greater appreciation of the architecture through experiencing it on a daily basis. It just shows that you should never judge a book by its cover.\u201d</p> <p>Ewald is just as content. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I\u2019d change, other than adding bi-fold doors to open up the living area to the balcony. That would really make the most of the elevated aspect, and the sunsets and sunrises we get to watch. You feel very connected to the elements up here, and having a long view in London is such a luxury.\u201d</p> <p><em>For details about Bradley Van Der Straeten, visit <a href=\"https://b-vds.co.uk/\" title=\"\">b-vds.co.uk</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "When Belgian architect Ewald Van Der Straeten discovered a flat for sale in east London\u2019s Trevelyan House in 2012, he jumped at the chance to view it, and then put in an offer the very next day. \u201cMy big dream would have been to live in a Barbican apartment. I love the robust beauty of the concrete and the well-proportioned interiors,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was pure luck that I found a flat in this building; it has many of the qualities I was seeking, which you just don\u2019t find in the majority of new builds.\u201d Trevelyan House was built in 1958 by Sir Denys Lasdun, the British architect behind the National Theatre\u2019s boldly Brutalist design. Lasdun devised the then radical idea of a butterfly plan, which saw the rear unit on each floor of this block of flats set at right angles to the other two, with a central core containing the stairs and lift. Not only did this improve the aspect of each apartment, it also negated the need for long access corridors and gave residents more privacy while maintaining a neighbourly atmosphere. Its \u201ccluster block\u201d design allowed for 24 new residences to be created on a relatively small Second World War bomb site in Bethnal Green, without disturbing the existing character of the street. While Ewald was instantly enamoured of the thoughtfully configured flat, his fianc\u00e9e, opera singer Louise Lloyd, took a little longer to adjust to life in the grey and boxy 1950s block. \u201cWhen we started dating I was living in a modern apartment building in west London, just minutes from Hyde Park, which I loved,\u201d she recalls. \u201cIt really was a testament to our relationship that I gave that up to move in here with Ewald. I didn\u2019t have a huge appreciation for the architecture at that point, and I found the block a little unattractive.\u201d They now share their two-bedroom Bethnal Green maisonette with their baby daughter, Maya. With its open-plan living area and split-level layout, the flat works extremely well for the young family, even though Ewald initially designed it for himself and a housemate. This is thanks to a considered remodel, which saw the original series of compartmentalised spaces reworked into a fluid, more functional floor plan. Ewald enlisted fellow architect George Bradley, long-time friend and co-founder of the pair\u2019s studio, Bradley Van Der Straeten Architects, to help with the project. Together, the duo came up with a \u201croom-within-a-room\u201d concept for the lower level, where the kitchen is conceived as a separate cube slotted into the living area. As well as zoning the space, the design is an ingenious response to building regulations, which prevented Ewald from removing the interior walls. The cube itself is built from Plyboo, a sustainable material made from sheets of bamboo \u2013 it looks like oak but is stronger and more affordable. The exterior is clad in dark grey MDF (made using a coloured resin rather than from painted MDF), applied as panels to create the impression of a box rather than a partition wall. Shadow gaps also add to this effect \u2013 a trick borrowed from the ancient Egyptians \u2013 which can be seen where the structure meets the floor and the ceiling. The work was undertaken in two stages: the upper floor was remodelled in just six weeks, and then, a year later, it took two months to complete the lower level. \u201cThe design took longer, of course,\u201d adds Ewald. \u201cIt\u2019s quite rare as an architect that you get the chance to do your own house up, but we were lucky to have some extra resources at the studio to help, so I took a long time to plan what I wanted to do.\u201d To complement the building\u2019s architectural origins, Ewald originally decorated the interior with pops of primary colour and a mix of midcentury furniture. Louise has since added a few flourishes of her own, which required patience and a little persuasiveness on her part. \u201cEwald was a bit protective over the flat,\u201d she laughs. \u201cHe saw it quite differently to how I did, and it took a couple of years to come to a compromise that suited both of us.\u201d Love won out and now the home is a happy mix of both their tastes, with Ewald\u2019s modernist pieces sitting comfortably alongside Louise\u2019s cheerful tonal colour and tactile fabrics. \u201cEverything we have now has been a joint decision \u2013 even the cushions,\u201d says Louise, who has come to appreciate why Ewald was so drawn to the space to begin with. \u201cLiving in a maisonette feels almost like a small house, so it\u2019s never claustrophobic, plus there\u2019s always so much light coming in. The way Ewald redesigned the flat is really clever, and I now have a much greater appreciation of the architecture through experiencing it on a daily basis. It just shows that you should never judge a book by its cover.\u201d Ewald is just as content. \u201cThere\u2019s not much I\u2019d change, other than adding bi-fold doors to open up the living area to the balcony. That would really make the most of the elevated aspect, and the sunsets and sunrises we get to watch. You feel very connected to the elements up here, and having a long view in London is such a luxury.\u201d For details about Bradley Van Der Straeten, visit b-vds.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Richie remembers the first time he sang properly: mouth wide open, lungs full of air. \u201cIt gave me freedom within,\u201d says the 53-year-old. \u201cI was suddenly able to see colour, life.\u201d The sense of freedom felt novel. Not only because Richie felt trapped by the terrible crime he had committed, but also because he was incarcerated deep inside Wandsworth prison.</p> <p>More precisely, Richie was locked within the jail\u2019s Trinity wing, a triple-storeyed Victorian corridor in an overcrowded prison repeatedly criticised by inspectors and where drugs and violence were rife.</p> <p>When word went round in April 2014 that volunteers from a community choir were about to enter the jail, Richie was curious. Along with 20 others he went along to Trinity\u2019s chapel and sang. It was a decision which, he says, saved his life. \u201cI would have ended it. I had nothing to live for. All the pain that had held me back drained away as my brain ran riot with harmonies,\u201d says Richie, grinning at the memory.</p> <p>Among those who attended the first visit into Wandsworth by Liberty Choir was Ross, a former senior army officer who took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq with the King\u2019s Regiment and who, after entering civvy street, was jailed for VAT fraud.</p> <p>Ross entered Trinity\u2019s chapel five years ago at the \u201clowest point of my life\u201d. As with Richie, the impact of what happened next was profound.</p> <p>\u201cFrom then I knew there was a space I could be safe in,\u201d recalls Ross. \u201cI could be free in that room with the choir for a couple of hours a week. There was genuine freedom in that room. The love from those people that came to see us was so important,\u201d adds the 47-year-old.</p> <p>One of those people was an American vocal coach MJ Paranzino who urged Richie and Ross to sing at the limit of their emotional and technical capacity.</p> <p>By then Paranzino had spent nearly a decade trying to persuade government officials to let her into Wandsworth prison. Her work \u2013 through MJ\u2019s Choirs, four community choirs in London and the South East \u2013 in homes for the elderly and neurological hospital wards had convinced her that communal singing transformed the mindset of vulnerable and traumatised individuals. \u201cThese were places people didn\u2019t normally visit, where people were forgotten.\u201d</p> <p>Paranzino also had harrowing firsthand experience of how a justice system that offered no prospect of rehabilitation or hope promised only bleak outcomes.</p> <p>George, her dear friend and relative, was a heroin user on the merry-go-round of short prison stays and rehabilitation. In February 2002 George left his latest rehabilitation session and slid back into heroin dependency.

      "bodyText": "Richie remembers the first time he sang properly: mouth wide open, lungs full of air. \u201cIt gave me freedom within,\u201d says the 53-year-old. \u201cI was suddenly able to see colour, life.\u201d The sense of freedom felt novel. Not only because Richie felt trapped by the terrible crime he had committed, but also because he was incarcerated deep inside Wandsworth prison. More precisely, Richie was locked within the jail\u2019s Trinity wing, a triple-storeyed Victorian corridor in an overcrowded prison repeatedly criticised by inspectors and where drugs and violence were rife. When word went round in April 2014 that volunteers from a community choir were about to enter the jail, Richie was curious. Along with 20 others he went along to Trinity\u2019s chapel and sang. It was a decision which, he says, saved his life. \u201cI would have ended it. I had nothing to live for. All the pain that had held me back drained away as my brain ran riot with harmonies,\u201d says Richie, grinning at the memory. Among those who attended the first visit into Wandsworth by Liberty Choir was Ross, a former senior army officer who took part in the 2003 invasion of Iraq with the King\u2019s Regiment and who, after entering civvy street, was jailed for VAT fraud. Ross entered Trinity\u2019s chapel five years ago at the \u201clowest point of my life\u201d. As with Richie, the impact of what happened next was profound. \u201cFrom then I knew there was a space I could be safe in,\u201d recalls Ross. \u201cI could be free in that room with the choir for a couple of hours a week. There was genuine freedom in that room. The love from those people that came to see us was so important,\u201d adds the 47-year-old. One of those people was an American vocal coach MJ Paranzino who urged Richie and Ross to sing at the limit of their emotional and technical capacity. By then Paranzino had spent nearly a decade trying to persuade government officials to let her into Wandsworth prison. Her work \u2013 through MJ\u2019s Choirs, four community choirs in London and the South East \u2013 in homes for the elderly and neurological hospital wards had convinced her that communal singing transformed the mindset of vulnerable and traumatised individuals. \u201cThese were places people didn\u2019t normally visit, where people were forgotten.\u201d Paranzino also had harrowing firsthand experience of how a justice system that offered no prospect of rehabilitation or hope promised only bleak outcomes. George, her dear friend and relative, was a heroin user on the merry-go-round of short prison stays and rehabilitation. In February 2002 George left his latest rehabilitation session and slid back into heroin dependency. Not long afterwards he hung himself, aged 43. Paranzino said: \u201cI do this for George because he was a good guy, a hard worker who had many skills. He was loved by all who knew him but he suffered from bipolar, abuse in early life and the prison of addiction. \u201c Since that first meeting with Richie and Ross, Paranzino\u2019s Liberty Choir has inspired hundreds of Wandsworth prisoners through 250 weekly sessions where volunteers and prisoners sing alongside one another. Many of those have since escaped the cycle of crime and punishment. Ross was stunned at how abruptly the posturing and rivalries of prison life were swept away when the choir began singing tracks such as Jessie J\u2019s Price Tag or ran through classic show tunes. \u201cNo matter how tough their background, they were all emotionally vulnerable. Opening your lungs and singing at top notch makes you vulnerable \u2013 but when you get it right, what a feeling,\u201d he said. There was also a sense of reclaiming something that had been taken away. \u201cYou feel society has rejected you. It has committed an act of calculated violence against you by removing your liberty,\u201d added Ross. At its most minimal the Liberty Choir, according to former inmates, loosens the pressure cooker tension of prison.

In a single year \u2013 1964 \u2013 he created 10 operas, and he was still directing in his late 80s. Italians use titles profusely. Anyone with a university degree must be greeted as dottore or dottoressa. Those who go into the professions will feel positively slighted unless they are addressed as architetto, ingegnere or whatever. Franco was immensely proud of having been given an honorary British knighthood (the first Italian ever to be honoured in that way). But, though as a renowned artist he more than qualified for the title of maestro, he would cut you off with an \u201cOh, for goodness sake,\u201d if you ever tried to use it.",

      "body": "<p>An emotional Amanda Knox has castigated the media for depicting her as a \u201cdirty man-eater\u201d when she was on trial for the murder of the British student Meredith Kercher.</p> \n<p>Knox, now 31, was twice convicted and twice acquitted of killing Kercher, 21, in the home they shared in the Italian university town of Perugia in November 2007.</p> \n<p>She returned to Italy this week for the first time since being released from prison in 2011, to participate in a debate entitled \u201cTrial by Media\u201d at the Criminal Justice festival in Modena.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the Kerchers\u2019 lawyer, Francesco Maresca, said Knox\u2019s public appearances were painful for the family.</p> \n<p>\u201cAll these insistences and appearances are only ever done to keep the attention on herself,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cThe murder is a tragic memory for the Kercher family. They lost their daughter and sister in such a terrible way. It\u2019s also an injustice for them as they still don\u2019t know the full truth.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/amanda-knox-meredith-kercher-family-label-return-italy-inappropriate\">Knox\u2019s return to Italy and involvement in the conference was </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/amanda-knox-meredith-kercher-family-label-return-italy-inappropriate\">inappropriate</a>, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s unjustified because her process was not a classic case of \u2018judicial error\u2019. There was a swing in the decisions: some judges decided one way, and others in another way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Knox, who had always declared her innocence, spoke about the moment she was found guilty for the first time and sentenced to 26 years in jail in 2009.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy innocence didn\u2019t save me because the media created a story \u2026 and people liked that story,\u201d she told a packed room on Saturday. \u201cI was the dirty man-eater, Foxy Knoxy.\u201d</p> \n<p>She accused the media of producing \u201cclickbait\u201d stories while she was imprisoned instead of examining the evidence of the case. She also spoke about her family being tormented by the press.</p> \n<p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t innocent until proven guilty, I was a wise, drugged-up whore \u2013 it was unfounded but it awoke people\u2019s imagination. These sensational and defamatory images also entered the courtroom. The investigation was contaminated and the jury corrupted. It was impossible for me to have a fair trial.\u201d</p> \n<p>Knox added: \u201cOn 1 November 2007 the robber Rudy Guede entered the house and raped and killed my housemate Meredith. His DNA was left and then he escaped the country. He was tried and convicted. But despite all the attention [on the case] hardly anyone heard of the name Rudy Guede, because all of the focus was on me.\u201d</p> \n<p>The body of Kercher, a student from Coulsdon, Surrey, who was in Italy on an Erasmus programme, was found under a duvet in her bedroom, partly undressed with multiple stab wounds.</p> \n<p>Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, spent four years in prison after initially being convicted of the murder. For Knox, three of those years were for a defamation conviction after she wrongly accused Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner, of the crime. Lumumba spent two weeks in jail and was released after someone came forward with an alibi for him. Knox had told investigators that she \u201ccovered her ears as he [Lumumba] killed\u201d. She later said she had made the allegation under police coercion.</p> \n<p>On Saturday she said she had retracted the accusation hours after making it, but had been ignored by the police.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey arrested Patrick, Raffaele and I,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next day they organised a press conference to say that the case is closed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Carlo Pacelli, the lawyer who represented Lumumba, told the Observer his client had not received any compensation over the defamation.</p> \n<p>\u201cPatrick was the victim of slander [by] Amanda Knox and for this she was given a three-year term for accusing a man she knew was innocent,\u201d Pacelli said.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe also never apologised to him,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d</p> \n<p>Knox and Sollecito were acquitted in 2011 before being convicted again in 2014 by the Florence appeals court, which ruled that the extent of the injuries inflicted on Kercher was such that Guede, the Ivorian man serving time for the murder, could not have acted alone. Italy\u2019s highest court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/07/amanda-knox-acquitted-because-of-stunning-flaws-in-investigation\">quashed the convictions</a> in a definitive ruling in 2015 because of \u201cstunning flaws\u201d in the investigation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/28/meredith-kercher-amanda-knox-raffaele-sollecito-italy-case\">Eight years on, Italy asks: so who were Meredith Kercher\u2019s killers?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Italy Innocence Project, the event organiser, has been criticised for inviting Knox to take part.</p> \n<p>\u201cShe was invited as she is an icon of trial by media,\u201d said Guido Sola, a lawyer with the organisation. \u201cKnox is a free person who is speaking about being slammed on the front pages and having her privacy violated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Knox described Kercher as a \u201cbrilliant girl\u201d whose friendship she had enjoyed for \u201ca very short time\u201d, and expressed her condolences to the family.</p> \n<p>The Kercher family rarely respond to the publicity generated by Knox, who reportedly earned \u00a33.5m for her memoir, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/28/inside-netflixs-amanda-knox-she-was-cast-as-a-she-devil\">took part in a Netflix documentary</a> about the case in 2016 and has been the subject of other books and films.</p> \n<p>\u201cNo system is perfect and this case wasn\u2019t perfectly done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of confusion and the Kercher family had to live with this anxiety \u2026 with false information \u2026 I am sorry for them.

      "bodyText": "An emotional Amanda Knox has castigated the media for depicting her as a \u201cdirty man-eater\u201d when she was on trial for the murder of the British student Meredith Kercher. Knox, now 31, was twice convicted and twice acquitted of killing Kercher, 21, in the home they shared in the Italian university town of Perugia in November 2007. She returned to Italy this week for the first time since being released from prison in 2011, to participate in a debate entitled \u201cTrial by Media\u201d at the Criminal Justice festival in Modena. Earlier this week, the Kerchers\u2019 lawyer, Francesco Maresca, said Knox\u2019s public appearances were painful for the family. \u201cAll these insistences and appearances are only ever done to keep the attention on herself,\u201d Maresca said. \u201cThe murder is a tragic memory for the Kercher family. They lost their daughter and sister in such a terrible way. It\u2019s also an injustice for them as they still don\u2019t know the full truth.\u201d He said Knox\u2019s return to Italy and involvement in the conference was inappropriate, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s unjustified because her process was not a classic case of \u2018judicial error\u2019. There was a swing in the decisions: some judges decided one way, and others in another way.\u201d Knox, who had always declared her innocence, spoke about the moment she was found guilty for the first time and sentenced to 26 years in jail in 2009. \u201cMy innocence didn\u2019t save me because the media created a story \u2026 and people liked that story,\u201d she told a packed room on Saturday. \u201cI was the dirty man-eater, Foxy Knoxy.\u201d She accused the media of producing \u201cclickbait\u201d stories while she was imprisoned instead of examining the evidence of the case. She also spoke about her family being tormented by the press. \u201cI wasn\u2019t innocent until proven guilty, I was a wise, drugged-up whore \u2013 it was unfounded but it awoke people\u2019s imagination. These sensational and defamatory images also entered the courtroom. The investigation was contaminated and the jury corrupted. It was impossible for me to have a fair trial.\u201d Knox added: \u201cOn 1 November 2007 the robber Rudy Guede entered the house and raped and killed my housemate Meredith. His DNA was left and then he escaped the country. He was tried and convicted. But despite all the attention [on the case] hardly anyone heard of the name Rudy Guede, because all of the focus was on me.\u201d The body of Kercher, a student from Coulsdon, Surrey, who was in Italy on an Erasmus programme, was found under a duvet in her bedroom, partly undressed with multiple stab wounds. Knox and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, spent four years in prison after initially being convicted of the murder. For Knox, three of those years were for a defamation conviction after she wrongly accused Patrick Lumumba, a bar owner, of the crime. Lumumba spent two weeks in jail and was released after someone came forward with an alibi for him. Knox had told investigators that she \u201ccovered her ears as he [Lumumba] killed\u201d. She later said she had made the allegation under police coercion. On Saturday she said she had retracted the accusation hours after making it, but had been ignored by the police. \u201cThey arrested Patrick, Raffaele and I,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next day they organised a press conference to say that the case is closed.\u201d Carlo Pacelli, the lawyer who represented Lumumba, told the Observer his client had not received any compensation over the defamation. \u201cPatrick was the victim of slander [by] Amanda Knox and for this she was given a three-year term for accusing a man she knew was innocent,\u201d Pacelli said. \u201cShe also never apologised to him,\u201d he claimed. \u201cIt\u2019s shameful.\u201d Knox and Sollecito were acquitted in 2011 before being convicted again in 2014 by the Florence appeals court, which ruled that the extent of the injuries inflicted on Kercher was such that Guede, the Ivorian man serving time for the murder, could not have acted alone. Italy\u2019s highest court quashed the convictions in a definitive ruling in 2015 because of \u201cstunning flaws\u201d in the investigation. Italy Innocence Project, the event organiser, has been criticised for inviting Knox to take part. \u201cShe was invited as she is an icon of trial by media,\u201d said Guido Sola, a lawyer with the organisation. \u201cKnox is a free person who is speaking about being slammed on the front pages and having her privacy violated.\u201d Knox described Kercher as a \u201cbrilliant girl\u201d whose friendship she had enjoyed for \u201ca very short time\u201d, and expressed her condolences to the family. The Kercher family rarely respond to the publicity generated by Knox, who reportedly earned \u00a33.5m for her memoir, took part in a Netflix documentary about the case in 2016 and has been the subject of other books and films. \u201cNo system is perfect and this case wasn\u2019t perfectly done,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of confusion and the Kercher family had to live with this anxiety \u2026 with false information \u2026 I am sorry for them. But the assassin is in jail.\u201d",

However, it\u2019s with his latest, impressive set that vocalist, multi-instrumentalist and producer Jordan Rakei is coming into his own. Rakei moved to London from Australia four years ago, and quickly became immersed in the UK scene. Though he appeared in 2015 on Masterpiece, from dance duo Disclosure\u2019s Caracal album, Rakei is perhaps best known for his work with frequent collaborators Loyle Carner and Tom Misch. In his solo work, Rakei makes jazz-imbued sounds that lean intricately into hip-hop and soul alike. He has found fans in seminal producers such as Robert Glasper and Terrace Martin, while Nile Rodgers is also an admirer. It was after spending time in the studio with the Chic mastermind that Rakei decided to explore hookier, funkier territory than before. His latest LP, Origin, is full of a rich, cinematic musicality that feels poppier, sparklier and more breezily ambitious. Lyrically, too, things are more expansive and conceptual: yes, there are still considerations of love, dreams and anxieties; but Rakei is also interrogating broader questions of technology and its disruption of everyday experience. As Rakei explained in a recent interview, \u201cI had more lyrics about my life experience, but I wanted to test my own comfort zone and try to write something that projects my vision of a future dystopian world.\u201d \u2022 Origin is out now on Ninja Tune",

      "bodyText": "Madrid\u2019s city council has swung sharply to the right after the conservative People\u2019s party (PP) and the centre-right Citizens party enlisted the controversial support of the far-right Vox to take control of the Spanish capital. On Saturday morning, three weeks after local and regional elections were held, the PP\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Luis Mart\u00ednez-Almeida was sworn in as mayor, with Citizens\u2019 Bego\u00f1a Villac\u00eds as his deputy. Mart\u00ednez-Almeida succeeds Manuela Carmena, a leftwing former judge whose four-year stint as mayor was marked by a commitment to diversity and the environment. The new mayor shrugged off criticism of his party\u2019s decision to work with Vox, challenging anyone \u201cto find anything that lies outside the legal order\u201d in his deals. But he also promised to serve all the people of Madrid. \u201cBetween us, we will build Madrid,\u201d said Mart\u00ednez-Almeida. \u201cWe won\u2019t leave behind those who want a more open Madrid. We want to write the future and not remember the past.\u201d Carmena congratulated her successor and reminded him of the importance of both feminism and democracy. \u201cWe need to look after democracy because we know what it cost to bring democracy to this country,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took so much, such an effort and so many lives that we cannot forget it.\u201d The PP has signalled that one of its first acts in office will be rethinking and possibly scrapping Carmena\u2019s urban low emissions zone, known as Madrid Central. Both the PP and Citizens have shifted further to the right over recent months in the hope of stopping their voters drifting towards Vox, whose tough line on Catalan independence, anti-immigration stance and tirades against feminism have attracted some traditional PP supporters. Citizens was subjected to fierce criticism last December after it cut a similar deal with Vox to govern the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda. Earlier this week, the French government explicitly warned Citizens \u2013 which is part of the new liberal group in the European parliament led by Emmanuel Macron \u2013 that any further cosying up to the far right would have consequences. On Friday, France\u2019s secretary of state for European affairs, Am\u00e9lie de Montchalin, expressed \u201cgrave concerns\u201d over such deals, adding: \u201cWe think that an alliance with the far right, like we have seen in Spain, is not an option.\u201d France\u2019s intervention led Vox to urge Spain\u2019s acting prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, to \u201cdefend Spaniards\u2019 independence\u201d in the face of \u201cunacceptable\u201d interference. The former French prime minister Manuel Valls, who staged an unsuccessful bid to become the mayor of Barcelona in last month\u2019s election, has also repeatedly warned his Citizens allies not to collaborate with Vox and called for a cordon sanitaire against the far right. Valls, who campaigned on a staunchly unionist platform, has thrown his weight behind Ada Colau, the leftwing mayor of Barcelona, who secured a second term in the Catalan capital in a vote on Saturday afternoon. The pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party won marginally more votes than Colau\u2019s group, but Colau retained office after reaching an agreement with the Catalan branch of the socialist party and Valls\u2019 councillors. Her election drew an angry response from some Catalan secessionists, who gathered in central Barcelona to protest and to chant, \u201cColau \u00e9s un frau!\u201d (\u201cColau is a fraud!\u201d). The wealthy northeastern region is governed by pro-independence parties. Although Citizens won the most seats and the largest share of the vote in the last regional election in December 2017, it could not assemble a governing coalition. The focus will now be on S\u00e1nchez\u2019s efforts to form a national government. While his Spanish Socialist Workers\u2019 party finished first in the general election at the end of April, it fell well short of a majority in the congress of deputies. S\u00e1nchez has agreed to cooperate with the anti-austerity Podemos party to work towards building a government, but has ruled out a coalition deal. He has also raised the possibility of holding another general election if his efforts to resume office are thwarted in parliament. Another vote \u2013 which would be Spain\u2019s fourth in under four years \u2013 would favour the socialists as it would hurt Podemos and see the three rightwing parties in renewed competition for votes.",

The book explores the lack of diversity in education, tackling topics including access, curriculums, mental health, relationships and activism. The two women, both 22, graduated from Cambridge University last year, Kwakye with a degree in history and Ogunbiyi in human, social and political sciences. Kwakye was born and raised in Chingford and is studying at the University of Law in preparation for a training contract with a City law firm. Ogunbiyi was born in Croydon, moved to Nigeria aged seven, then back to England aged 13, when she attended a boarding school. She has just completed a master\u2019s in journalism at Columbia University in New York.</p> <p><strong>How did </strong><strong>the book come about?</strong><br><strong>Chelsea Kwakye </strong>In December 2017, Ore wrote an article titled <a href=\"https://www.varsity.co.uk/features/14214\" title=\"\">\u201cA letter to my fresher self: surviving Cambridge as a black girl\u201d</a> [for the student newspaper <em>Varsity</em>], which detailed everything from impostor syndrome and relationships at university to stagnant curriculums. Previously, we were both heavily involved in black access to Cambridge initiatives, setting up Cambridge University African Caribbean Society\u2019s first access conference and mentoring scheme. Earlier that year we shot the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cambridge.acs/posts/1881865065434347\" title=\"\">#BlackMenofCambridge</a> campaign, which thrust us and our society into the spotlight. We gained a lot of media attention and conversation was buzzing around what it means and looks like to be black within predominately white universities and institutions.</p> <p> It was my sister who suggested we write a book. Then someone from #Merky reached out to us \u2013 having heard about our efforts at Cambridge \u2013 and the next thing we knew we were in a meeting with Penguin. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75a21aea5afef3a78f1a6960e7b0964aaed4ca80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75a21aea5afef3a78f1a6960e7b0964aaed4ca80/0_0_2048_1356/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The viral #BlackMenofCambridge photo taken by Cambridge African Caribbean Society.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The viral #BlackMenofCambridge photo taken by Cambridge African Caribbean Society.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @CambridgeACS/Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Ore, tell </strong><strong>us </strong><strong>about </strong><strong>\u201cA Letter to My Fresher Self</strong><strong>\u201d</strong><strong> \u2013 in it you reassure </strong><strong>your younger self: \u201cyou belong here\u201d</strong><strong>.</strong><br><strong>Ore Ogunbiyi </strong>I had just lost an election for president of my college students\u2019 union and felt strongly I had lost to someone who did not have as much experience as me.

What was it like day to day? Did you fit in?</strong><br><strong>CK </strong>What I struggled with the most was expectation. There was an expectation that I was a \u201cprofessional black person\u201d. Someone who supposedly knew everything about race or black feminism or \u201cAfrica\u201d. I felt a constant pressure to be a representative for the whole black population because that was the burden put on my shoulders. [She was the only black woman in her 2015 history cohort.] I feel like lecturers and tutors expected you to contribute something different all the time just by virtue of being black. </p> <p><strong>Ore, you write that an aim of the book is to share in a \u201cremarkable sisterhood\u201d\u2026</strong><br><strong>OO </strong>I couldn\u2019t have survived without my girlfriends. I was lucky at my college as I had two other black girls in my year who I\u2019m still very close with, and with Chelsea, that was our squad. We needed each other, we thrived off each other, and each others\u2019 energies are what kept us going when things got bad and our mental health suffered and we needed a little cry. It\u2019s about making sure that even if you have no one, you have this book and you find some kind of solace in reading about our experiences. You don\u2019t ever want to be the black girl who\u2019s done really well but not left the door open for everyone else to come behind you. You don\u2019t ever want to be that person.</p> <p><strong>You write how you don\u2019t like the term \u201cBAME</strong><strong>\u201d. Why not?</strong><br><strong>OO </strong>I don\u2019t like the term BAME because it conflates the different issues that groups face and glosses over them. Chelsea talks about access and how black international students do relatively well. There\u2019s also an issue of conflating Africans and Caribbeans, because in access stats, Caribbean students perform worse than black Africans, so if you just talk about black students you\u2019re conflating that. Also, anti-black racism doesn\u2019t just come from white people. I was asked if I went to the other university in Cambridge (Anglia Ruskin) by a south Asian boy.</p> <p><strong>A chapter by Chelsea describes relationships and desirability</strong><strong>.</strong><br><strong>CK </strong>I have a white boyfriend, and interracial relationships can be quite tricky and complicated \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re aware of the structures that surround them, such as racism and power dynamics. Joe and I have a really positive relationship, which prioritises conversations about race rather than sweeping them under the carpet. But it wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. A few black male students felt they could comment on my relationship and what I should be doing. I learned that I wasn\u2019t obliged to explain to anyone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e1668e8542378bb5638eac949f70fcd50f84ac66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1668e8542378bb5638eac949f70fcd50f84ac66/0_287_1968_2458/801.jpg\" alt=\"Sonita Alleyne, the new master of Jesus College, and the first black head of an Oxbridge college.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sonita Alleyne, the new master of Jesus College, and the first black head of an Oxbridge college.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jesus College Cambridge/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>OO</strong> It\u2019s funny to watch <em>Love Island</em> \u2013 a friend made a point about how we\u2019re all laughing at Yewande\u2019s situation, but that was us at Cambridge. We all think \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t anyone want her? She\u2019s been very quiet \u2013 it feels like her light has been dimmed. It\u2019s interesting to see how many parallels that draws with Cambridge. It\u2019s partly society\u2019s fault, conditioning white boys to not see black girls, specifically dark-skinned black girls, as beautiful. At Cambridge, as black women we outnumber black men. It was hard, definitely. It felt like you were dimming your light and being less you so people didn\u2019t think you\u2019re intimidating, or all these derogatory tropes. I had conversations with people about my own wellbeing, and self-love \u2013 it got easier and more bearable. I had great friends and support systems, so I realised it wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me but with society.</p> <p><strong>Chelsea, you write a chapter that movingly explores mental health</strong><strong>. W</strong><strong>as it important for you to talk about that?</strong><br><strong>CK </strong>Mental health can be awful at university. Once you add race, class and gender it [vulnerability] triples. Being open can help people understand.

      "bodyText": "CChelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi are the co-authors of Taking Up Space: The Black Girl\u2019s Manifesto for Change, the second title from #Merky Books, a partnership between Penguin and grime star Stormzy, who has also announced he is funding two Cambridge scholarships for black students in the UK. The book explores the lack of diversity in education, tackling topics including access, curriculums, mental health, relationships and activism. The two women, both 22, graduated from Cambridge University last year, Kwakye with a degree in history and Ogunbiyi in human, social and political sciences. Kwakye was born and raised in Chingford and is studying at the University of Law in preparation for a training contract with a City law firm. Ogunbiyi was born in Croydon, moved to Nigeria aged seven, then back to England aged 13, when she attended a boarding school. She has just completed a master\u2019s in journalism at Columbia University in New York. How did the book come about? Chelsea Kwakye In December 2017, Ore wrote an article titled \u201cA letter to my fresher self: surviving Cambridge as a black girl\u201d [for the student newspaper Varsity], which detailed everything from impostor syndrome and relationships at university to stagnant curriculums. Previously, we were both heavily involved in black access to Cambridge initiatives, setting up Cambridge University African Caribbean Society\u2019s first access conference and mentoring scheme. Earlier that year we shot the #BlackMenofCambridge campaign, which thrust us and our society into the spotlight. We gained a lot of media attention and conversation was buzzing around what it means and looks like to be black within predominately white universities and institutions. It was my sister who suggested we write a book. Then someone from #Merky reached out to us \u2013 having heard about our efforts at Cambridge \u2013 and the next thing we knew we were in a meeting with Penguin. Ore, tell us about \u201cA Letter to My Fresher Self\u201d \u2013 in it you reassure your younger self: \u201cyou belong here\u201d. Ore Ogunbiyi I had just lost an election for president of my college students\u2019 union and felt strongly I had lost to someone who did not have as much experience as me. I felt very isolated \u2013 it was a difficult time and I was at a very low place when I wrote that. But I thought: how can I see some kind of bright side in this Cambridge experience and not be like, \u201cI\u2019m really sad because I\u2019m a black girl in this space\u201d?

The stats are pretty shocking \u2013 1.8% of all academic staff in the UK are black, and it\u2019s 0.6% at professorial level. And it\u2019s not because we\u2019re not clever. How does that create impostor syndrome? OO Even though some people are telling us we\u2019re welcome, there\u2019s so much else telling us that we\u2019re not, whether that be the portraits on the wall or that there are more black people being employed as cleaners and porters and receptionists than there are as academics [as revealed in 2017 data released by the Higher Education Statistics Agency]. It\u2019s important to understand impostor syndrome in that way \u2013 it\u2019s not just \u201cI don\u2019t feel good enough\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s I don\u2019t feel good enough because there are all these things telling me I don\u2019t belong here. Were you treated differently at Cambridge? What was it like day to day? Did you fit in? CK What I struggled with the most was expectation. There was an expectation that I was a \u201cprofessional black person\u201d. Someone who supposedly knew everything about race or black feminism or \u201cAfrica\u201d. I felt a constant pressure to be a representative for the whole black population because that was the burden put on my shoulders. [She was the only black woman in her 2015 history cohort.] I feel like lecturers and tutors expected you to contribute something different all the time just by virtue of being black. Ore, you write that an aim of the book is to share in a \u201cremarkable sisterhood\u201d\u2026 OO I couldn\u2019t have survived without my girlfriends. I was lucky at my college as I had two other black girls in my year who I\u2019m still very close with, and with Chelsea, that was our squad. We needed each other, we thrived off each other, and each others\u2019 energies are what kept us going when things got bad and our mental health suffered and we needed a little cry. It\u2019s about making sure that even if you have no one, you have this book and you find some kind of solace in reading about our experiences. You don\u2019t ever want to be the black girl who\u2019s done really well but not left the door open for everyone else to come behind you. You don\u2019t ever want to be that person. You write how you don\u2019t like the term \u201cBAME\u201d. Why not? OO I don\u2019t like the term BAME because it conflates the different issues that groups face and glosses over them. Chelsea talks about access and how black international students do relatively well. There\u2019s also an issue of conflating Africans and Caribbeans, because in access stats, Caribbean students perform worse than black Africans, so if you just talk about black students you\u2019re conflating that. Also, anti-black racism doesn\u2019t just come from white people. I was asked if I went to the other university in Cambridge (Anglia Ruskin) by a south Asian boy. A chapter by Chelsea describes relationships and desirability. CK I have a white boyfriend, and interracial relationships can be quite tricky and complicated \u2013 particularly if you\u2019re aware of the structures that surround them, such as racism and power dynamics. Joe and I have a really positive relationship, which prioritises conversations about race rather than sweeping them under the carpet. But it wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. A few black male students felt they could comment on my relationship and what I should be doing. I learned that I wasn\u2019t obliged to explain to anyone. OO It\u2019s funny to watch Love Island \u2013 a friend made a point about how we\u2019re all laughing at Yewande\u2019s situation, but that was us at Cambridge. We all think \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t anyone want her? She\u2019s been very quiet \u2013 it feels like her light has been dimmed. It\u2019s interesting to see how many parallels that draws with Cambridge. It\u2019s partly society\u2019s fault, conditioning white boys to not see black girls, specifically dark-skinned black girls, as beautiful. At Cambridge, as black women we outnumber black men. It was hard, definitely. It felt like you were dimming your light and being less you so people didn\u2019t think you\u2019re intimidating, or all these derogatory tropes. I had conversations with people about my own wellbeing, and self-love \u2013 it got easier and more bearable. I had great friends and support systems, so I realised it wasn\u2019t anything wrong with me but with society. Chelsea, you write a chapter that movingly explores mental health. Was it important for you to talk about that? CK Mental health can be awful at university. Once you add race, class and gender it [vulnerability] triples. Being open can help people understand. When we talk about mental health, it\u2019s not frameworks or theories, it\u2019s our lives, our experience, which we went through daily \u2013 that has to sink in for people to understand the gravity of the book. Recently, the first black person was to appointed to lead an Oxbridge college. What was your reaction? OO At first I didn\u2019t believe it. I got wind of it a few days before and I was like no way, someone\u2019s messing with me, there\u2019s no way a Cambridge college is about to put a black woman in charge. And then I saw the announcement and I was like, oh my goodness, it\u2019s really happening. She is packed with credentials, she was voted into that position, it\u2019s great to see that representation, and I\u2019m proud it\u2019s at Jesus College, where I went.

This is a national issue. There\u2019s a crisis in the sector that\u2019s been heading down the tracks for some time.\u201d</p> <p>Corporate donations to medium-sized charities such as Shooting Star Children\u2019s Hospices have fallen by more than \u00a3250,000 a year as companies \u201csit on their hands, waiting for Brexit and saving their cash,\u201d he said. The charity receives government funding of less than \u00a3700,000 a year, a sum that has gone up by just \u00a340,000 in 11 years, and must raise more than \u00a310m of funding from donations. It made 12 staff redundant last year and Harding would not rule out further redundancies: \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t know what the future holds for us.\u201d</p> <p>For Harding, hearing candidates in the Conservative leadership talk about tax cuts was the last straw. \u201cIf they can fund tax cuts, what about the dying? Our society is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable. Who is more vulnerable than children with life-limiting illnesses and severe disabilities?\u201d</p> <p>Last month, he wrote to all the MPs in his catchment area, including Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, John McDonnell and Philip Hammond, warning them about the cuts at the hospice. Only Vince Cable and the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh replied.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cHospices have always been part-funded by local NHS organisations, and local areas are responsible for ensuring services they commission meet the needs of their communities. The NHS long-term plan prioritises improvements in children\u2019s palliative care, and the NHS has committed to increase funding for these services, including hospices, by up to \u00a37m a year.\u201d</p>",

The Birmingham-based Acorns Children\u2019s Hospice announced this month that it was shutting its Walsall branch after 20 years of helping more than 200 children with life-limiting illnesses. Harding is calling on the government to increase its annual grant to children\u2019s hospices, and said if the cuts he makes this year are not enough next year Shooting Star would also be forced to consider closing a hospice. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just affecting us. This is a national issue. There\u2019s a crisis in the sector that\u2019s been heading down the tracks for some time.\u201d Corporate donations to medium-sized charities such as Shooting Star Children\u2019s Hospices have fallen by more than \u00a3250,000 a year as companies \u201csit on their hands, waiting for Brexit and saving their cash,\u201d he said. The charity receives government funding of less than \u00a3700,000 a year, a sum that has gone up by just \u00a340,000 in 11 years, and must raise more than \u00a310m of funding from donations. It made 12 staff redundant last year and Harding would not rule out further redundancies: \u201cQuite honestly, I don\u2019t know what the future holds for us.\u201d For Harding, hearing candidates in the Conservative leadership talk about tax cuts was the last straw. \u201cIf they can fund tax cuts, what about the dying? Our society is judged by the way it treats its most vulnerable. Who is more vulnerable than children with life-limiting illnesses and severe disabilities?\u201d Last month, he wrote to all the MPs in his catchment area, including Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, John McDonnell and Philip Hammond, warning them about the cuts at the hospice. Only Vince Cable and the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh replied. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cHospices have always been part-funded by local NHS organisations, and local areas are responsible for ensuring services they commission meet the needs of their communities. The NHS long-term plan prioritises improvements in children\u2019s palliative care, and the NHS has committed to increase funding for these services, including hospices, by up to \u00a37m a year.\u201d",

His lavish opera productions brought sensational performances by Joan Sutherland and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jul/23/how-we-made-zeffirelli-callas-tosca\">Maria Callas</a>; 25 years after the latter\u2019s death he directed a biopic, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n_f3-y7sW8\">Callas Forever</a>, starring Fanny Ardant. His filmed operas reached large TV audiences and he was celebrated as a great populariser.</p> <p>Zeffirelli believed he had inherited his passion for music from his grandfather, a conductor. He was born on 12 February 1923 and raised in Florence, the illegitimate son of a fashion designer, Alaide Garosi Cipriani, and wool merchant Ottorino Corsi, both of whom were married to other people. He was named by his mother after a line about <em>zeffiretti</em> (breezes) in a Mozart aria. Cipriani, whose career was damaged by the scandal, died when her son was six and he was taken in by his aunt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/15/franco-zeffirelli-obituary\">Franco Zeffirelli obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>His passion for theatre was sparked as a child during holidays spent in Tuscany where he saw performances by travelling players. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed anything at the theatre as much as the fantasies those storytellers brought us,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.</p> <p>He attended a Roman Catholic school in Florence where he said he was <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/film-director-zeffirelli-tells-of-being-abused-by-priest-1.1031715\">sexually assaulted by a priest</a>. When the second world war broke out, he joined the partisan effort, twice escaped death by firing squad and became an interpreter for the Scots Guards. In the postwar years he switched from plans to be an architect and began a career as an actor in radio productions, including a role alongside Anna Magnani in L\u2019Onorevole Angelina.

Visconti directed him in a small role in a stage adaptation of Crime and Punishment in Rome, then made him assistant director on his 1948 neo-realist classic La Terra Trema, filmed in Sicily using non-professional actors. Zeffirelli then assisted Salvador Dal\u00ed on his designs for As You Like It, directed by Visconti. His first task, he recalled, was persuading Dal\u00ed to use stuffed goats rather than real ones in the stage production.</p> <p>In the mid-1950s, Zeffirelli directed Callas for the first time, at her request, in Rossini\u2019s Il Turco in Italia. He went on to direct her in a series of spectacular operas including La Traviata in Dallas in 1958, which broke with tradition by opening with her character dying and then unfolding in flashback. He also directed Bellini\u2019s Norma in Paris in 1964, featuring his own set designs, and Callas\u2019s final operatic role, Tosca at Covent Garden in 1965.</p> <p>The other soprano Zeffirelli enjoyed a lengthy collaboration with was Sutherland whose career exploded into stardom after he directed her in a blood-soaked version of Lucia di Lammermoor, conducted by Tullio Serafin, at the Royal Opera House in London in 1959.</p> <p>Later that year, also at the ROH, Zeffirelli staged the short operas Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci, giving them both an authentically realised Sicilian setting. These led to the Old Vic asking him to stage Romeo and Juliet with a similarly realistic Italian setting.

      "bodyText": "Franco Zeffirelli, one of Italy\u2019s most revered artistic figures, has died at the age of 96. In a career spanning more than 60 years, Zeffirelli was staggeringly prolific and equally celebrated as a director of films, theatre and opera. Several of his stage productions became successes on screen \u2013 most notably a vibrant version of Romeo and Juliet which starred a young Judi Dench at the Old Vic in London and led to an Oscar-winning box-office smash in the late 1960s. Shakespeare inspired other hit movies for Zeffirelli: The Taming of the Shrew with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, Hamlet with Mel Gibson and Glenn Close, and a film of Verdi\u2019s Otello with Pl\u00e1cido Domingo. His lavish opera productions brought sensational performances by Joan Sutherland and Maria Callas; 25 years after the latter\u2019s death he directed a biopic, Callas Forever, starring Fanny Ardant. His filmed operas reached large TV audiences and he was celebrated as a great populariser. Zeffirelli believed he had inherited his passion for music from his grandfather, a conductor. He was born on 12 February 1923 and raised in Florence, the illegitimate son of a fashion designer, Alaide Garosi Cipriani, and wool merchant Ottorino Corsi, both of whom were married to other people. He was named by his mother after a line about zeffiretti (breezes) in a Mozart aria. Cipriani, whose career was damaged by the scandal, died when her son was six and he was taken in by his aunt. His passion for theatre was sparked as a child during holidays spent in Tuscany where he saw performances by travelling players. \u201cI\u2019ve never believed anything at the theatre as much as the fantasies those storytellers brought us,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography. He attended a Roman Catholic school in Florence where he said he was sexually assaulted by a priest. When the second world war broke out, he joined the partisan effort, twice escaped death by firing squad and became an interpreter for the Scots Guards. In the postwar years he switched from plans to be an architect and began a career as an actor in radio productions, including a role alongside Anna Magnani in L\u2019Onorevole Angelina. Many years later, he would direct Magnani\u2019s return to the stage in the long-running show La Lupa. Zeffirelli credited Luchino Visconti with changing his life. Visconti directed him in a small role in a stage adaptation of Crime and Punishment in Rome, then made him assistant director on his 1948 neo-realist classic La Terra Trema, filmed in Sicily using non-professional actors. Zeffirelli then assisted Salvador Dal\u00ed on his designs for As You Like It, directed by Visconti. His first task, he recalled, was persuading Dal\u00ed to use stuffed goats rather than real ones in the stage production. In the mid-1950s, Zeffirelli directed Callas for the first time, at her request, in Rossini\u2019s Il Turco in Italia. He went on to direct her in a series of spectacular operas including La Traviata in Dallas in 1958, which broke with tradition by opening with her character dying and then unfolding in flashback. He also directed Bellini\u2019s Norma in Paris in 1964, featuring his own set designs, and Callas\u2019s final operatic role, Tosca at Covent Garden in 1965. The other soprano Zeffirelli enjoyed a lengthy collaboration with was Sutherland whose career exploded into stardom after he directed her in a blood-soaked version of Lucia di Lammermoor, conducted by Tullio Serafin, at the Royal Opera House in London in 1959. Later that year, also at the ROH, Zeffirelli staged the short operas Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci, giving them both an authentically realised Sicilian setting. These led to the Old Vic asking him to stage Romeo and Juliet with a similarly realistic Italian setting. Although anxious about directing Shakespeare in English and in England, Zeffirelli launched a youthful production of the tragedy, starring Dench and John Stride. It was dismissed by many critics but championed by the Observer\u2019s Kenneth Tynan, who wrote that Zeffirelli: \u201capproached Shakespeare with fresh eyes, quick wits and no stylistic preconceptions; and what he worked was a miracle \u2026 The director has taken the simple and startling course of treating [the characters] as if they were real people in a real situation.\u201d Zeffirelli\u2019s film version of Romeo and Juliet was also a breath of fresh air. Starring teenagers Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, it was partly shot outdoors, had an unstagy feel and reached a young audience. The film helped make Zeffirelli rich. For many years, he claimed, he had been getting by on freelance director fees and had supplemented his income by selling off a series of Matisse drawings given to him as a gift by Coco Chanel. In between the theatre and film versions of Romeo, he staged a Sicilian-style Much Ado About Nothing at the Old Vic with Maggie Smith, Robert Stephens and Albert Finney, and shot The Taming of the Shrew with the combustible star power of Taylor and Burton. The couple partly funded the film, which was shot at Dino De Laurentiis\u2019s studios in Rome. Zeffirelli grew accustomed to stepping from one grandly ambitious project to the next, juggling theatre, TV and opera productions. In 1976, he directed Otello at La Scala with Domingo; the following year his epic TV film Jesus of Nazareth, with Robert Powell as Christ, Ian McShane as Judas Iscariot and Anne Bancroft as Mary Magdalene, was broadcast to a large audience. By 1978 he was preparing a remake of the sentimental drama The Champ, which would star Jon Voight and Faye Dunaway and become a box-office hit. Further film projects included the 1981 romance Endless Love, starring Brooke Shields and released in an edit that upset Zeffirelli, a 1988 biopic of the conductor Arturo Toscanini and a 1996 adaptation of Jane Eyre with the title role shared by Anna Paquin and Charlotte Gainsbourg. The semi-autobiographical Tea With Mussolini (1999), starring Smith, Dench and Joan Plowright, was co-written by Zeffirelli and John Mortimer.

      "bodyText": "\ufeffAn indigenous campesino woman who pledges to root out racism is hoping to cause a historic upset in Guatemala\u2019s elections on Sunday, amid simmering voter anger over political corruption. Thelma Cabrera P\u00e9rez, 49, has unexpectedly risen in presidential polls after a frenetic campaign across Guatemala\u2019s rural heartlands where organised crime and agriculture magnates have controlled land and politics since the 36-year civil war ended in 1996. Cabrera, a Maya Mam indigenous rights defender, is currently polling fifth in a crowded field of 20 candidates, but Guatemalan polls are notoriously weighted towards urban areas, and analysts believe she has a serious chance of getting through to a runoff vote in August. Win or lose, her political ascent marks a historic achievement at a time when trust in the country\u2019s status quo is at rock bottom. About 60% of the Guatemalan population is indigenous, but Cabrera is only the second indigenous person to run for president after the Nobel Peace prize winner Rigoberta Menchu. Indigenous groups suffer the highest rates of malnutrition, illiteracy, landlessness, social exclusion and poverty \u2013 all of which have helped drive waves of emigration. In November, Guatemalans overtook Mexicans as the largest group detained at the US border, and the regions where most migrants set out from are overwhelmingly indigenous. Cabrera pledges to tackle the inequalities of Guatemalan society with a sweeping constitutional reform to ensure fair representation for the country\u2019s indigenous, Afro-Guatemalan and mestizo peoples. Other priorities include stopping illegal land-grabs, ending immunity for elected officials, nationalisation of electricity, and legal scrutiny of mining, dam and agricultural licences sanctioned without consultation. \u201cI didn\u2019t ask for this role or buy it \u2013 I was elected for this mission by the people, and I\u2019m daring to break the silence as a Mam woman,\u201d Cabrera told the Observer. Cabrera, who speaks Spanish as a second language, grew up in El Asintal, an impoverished community on the west coast, where she worked on coffee fincas with her parents and siblings, and was married at 15. \u201cI came from nothing \u2013 from under the rubbish. But for many years I\u2019ve worked with communities suffering lack of opportunities, undignified wages, migration and violence as a result of structural problems and corruption,\u201d she said. She was selected by grassroots members of Codeca, the country\u2019s largest campesino organisation to represent its newly formed political party the Movement for the Liberation of Peoples (MLP). Cabrera\u2019s political hopes were given a major boost by a recent online campaign organised by volunteer communication experts who designed the slogan Yo Elijo Dignidad (I choose dignity). As the buzz around Cabrera got louder, the criticism got uglier. She\u2019s been derided as uneducated and uncouth, and condemned as a radical communist who wants to turn Guatemala into the next Venezuela \u2013 an accusation she denies. \u201cShe\u2019s given a face and voice to the excluded majority with a radical political project to disrupt and transform the oppressive state. She\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve seen since the 1940s,\u201d said Andrea Ixchiu, a member of her communications team. \u201cThis candidacy is historic.\u201d The election race has been marred by repeated accusations of corruption as a UN-backed commission against impunity (Cicig) prepares to leave the country after President Jimmy Morales unilaterally declared an end of its mandate. The current frontrunner is Sandra Torres, a former first lady accused of money laundering and illicit campaign financing. In second place is Alejandro Giammattei who was director of prisons while a clandestine death squad carried out extrajudicial killings of detainees. In third place is the businessman Roberto Arz\u00fa, who faces sanctions in Miami for failing to comply with a court order to pay off multimillion-dollar debts to his political strategist. The odds are stacked against Cabrera, who closed her campaign last Saturday by thanking in Mam her supporters who had travelled overnight from remote villages with homemade signs. But for many at the event, the hopeful atmosphere was reminiscent of the 2015 anti-corruption protests that eventually led to the resignation, arrest and imprisonment of the then president, Otto P\u00e9rez Molina. \u201cIt\u2019s time the state stopped being racist \u2013 and for that we need structural reforms,\u201d said Linda Rabanales, 24, an anthropology student. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m voting for Thelma.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Born in 1963, Maxim Osipov has been publishing his clear-eyed tales of life in contemporary Russia since 2007. His widely admired stories have won several prizes there and this extraordinary collection is his first to be translated into English. In the title story, a provincial teacher tries to make sense of his past. Many of the boys he once taught are now dead (\u201cdrugs, war, \u2018business\u2019 \u2026\u201d), and the people who control the town are cruel, dishonest, paranoid; nostalgic for old Soviet certainties. The story\u2019s small town is a microcosm of modern Russia, where corruption permeates almost every thread of the social fabric and power is often synonymous with theft.</p> <p>Nobel prize-winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/svetlana-alexievich\" title=\"\">Svetlana Alexievich</a>, whose own bleak reportage provides similarly forensic insights, has written a short preface to <em>Rock, Paper, Scissors</em>. With a nod to Osipov\u2019s other profession as a cardiologist, she describes his prose as \u201can accurate, unforgiving diagnosis of Russian life\u201d. The stories leave you thinking \u201chow difficult it is to love humanity \u2013 wonderful, repulsive, and terrifying as it is\u201d, but are also suffused with compassion.</p> <p>The opening piece is set in a provincial hospital. It includes a micro-manifesto for writers: in order to love humanity and the wider world, they must \u201cnotice, recall, invent\u201d. The details of Russian life are evocative \u2013 pelmeni dumplings, pickles and salted fish. It begins: \u201cThe Provinces as home: warm, grubby, ours.\u201d It\u2019s a scene-setting sentence to inspire confidence; readers won\u2019t waste their time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/07/the-writers-russians-dont-read-and-you-should\">The writers Russians don't read \u2013 and you should</a> </p> </aside>  <p>You can fall for Central Russia, Osipov writes in a typically double-edged comment, as easily \u201cas a woman can fall for a loser\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Born in 1963, Maxim Osipov has been publishing his clear-eyed tales of life in contemporary Russia since 2007. His widely admired stories have won several prizes there and this extraordinary collection is his first to be translated into English. In the title story, a provincial teacher tries to make sense of his past. Many of the boys he once taught are now dead (\u201cdrugs, war, \u2018business\u2019 \u2026\u201d), and the people who control the town are cruel, dishonest, paranoid; nostalgic for old Soviet certainties. The story\u2019s small town is a microcosm of modern Russia, where corruption permeates almost every thread of the social fabric and power is often synonymous with theft. Nobel prize-winner Svetlana Alexievich, whose own bleak reportage provides similarly forensic insights, has written a short preface to Rock, Paper, Scissors. With a nod to Osipov\u2019s other profession as a cardiologist, she describes his prose as \u201can accurate, unforgiving diagnosis of Russian life\u201d. The stories leave you thinking \u201chow difficult it is to love humanity \u2013 wonderful, repulsive, and terrifying as it is\u201d, but are also suffused with compassion. The opening piece is set in a provincial hospital. It includes a micro-manifesto for writers: in order to love humanity and the wider world, they must \u201cnotice, recall, invent\u201d. The details of Russian life are evocative \u2013 pelmeni dumplings, pickles and salted fish. It begins: \u201cThe Provinces as home: warm, grubby, ours.\u201d It\u2019s a scene-setting sentence to inspire confidence; readers won\u2019t waste their time. You can fall for Central Russia, Osipov writes in a typically double-edged comment, as easily \u201cas a woman can fall for a loser\u201d. Whether pitiless or pitiable, women don\u2019t have a great time in his stories. If they\u2019re not Machiavels with hairy moles, they are murdered by random strangers or chased by axe-wielding offspring. One relatively positive female protagonist is the nameless musician in \u201cPolish Friend\u201d, a whimsical story with speculative forays into the near future. \u201cWho knows what will have become of the EU \u2026 by then?\u201d Osipov writes gloomily. There are redemptive moments here, and comedy, but mundane graft and casual violence permeate Osipov\u2019s tales. The worst events are often described with devastating economy (\u201cSome say that it was pills she took, others \u2013 poison\u201d). One character, a doctor who makes extra money escorting sick people to the US, falls asleep thinking of synonyms for \u201cpointless\u201d. These are engaging translations from a team with a very strong track record. Anne Marie Jackson helped introduce anglophone readers to the unforgettable tales of Teffi. Boris Dralyuk has produced pitch-perfect versions of stories by Isaac Babel, among others, and co-edited the phenomenal Penguin Book of Russian Poetry.

After the power is switched off when a group of actors are forced to abandon their town, one quotes: \u201cMother asks you not to chop down the cherry orchard until she\u2019s gone.\u201d Osipov follows (sometimes literally) the rule of \u201cChekhov\u2019s gun\u201d: include only details relevant to the story.

      "body": "<p>With a few deep sighs and a rattle of stick on wood, Thomas Larcher\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://snapemaltings.co.uk/whats-on/the-hunting-gun/\" title=\"\">The Hunting Gun</a> </strong>sidles into life like a beast waking from slumber. It\u2019s a bold start to a breathtaking piece \u2013 unquestionably one of the outstanding events in a crowded summer season \u2013 which, nearly two hours later, in similar vein, sinks back into oblivion. First seen at the Bregenz festival last year, its UK premiere was the opening highlight of the 2019 Aldeburgh festival, where the Austrian composer is one of this year\u2019s resident artists.</p> <p>Everything about this dense, sinewy opera, the composer\u2019s first, is in the detail. Based on the 1949 novel of solitude by Yasushi Inoue, the libretto by Friederike G\u00f6sweiner retains the Japanese writer\u2019s understated aesthetic. We could dwell on the human dilemma: a gnarl of deceits born out of a love triangle, a betrayed teenager and the poet who enables this tale to be told. Emotions are raw and filleted as meat on a block. As Larcher (b1963) has said, the story can be understood by anyone involved in human relationships, \u201cwhether to stay or leave, speak out or stay silent, hold on or let go\u201d.</p> <p>The enigma lies, instead, in the music, and in how he creates such aural variety and wholeness, without it all becoming an eclectic mess. Those opening sighs are made by wind and brass players blowing into their instruments without making notes. The in-out squeeze of an accordion adds melancholy resonance. A wordless chorus \u2013 the vocal ensemble <a href=\"http://www.exaudi.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Exaudi</a> \u2013 adds atmosphere. A spectral rat-a-tat was achieved (I later discovered) by a drum roll played on a piece of A3 paper suspended from the back of a music stand. Then the work springs to life with a whispering, then a roaring, rush of ascent and passion. The newly formed Knussen Chamber Orchestra, conducted by <a href=\"http://www.grovesartists.com/artist/ryan-wigglesworth/\" title=\"\">Ryan Wigglesworth</a>, played every note and noise with buoyancy and grace.</p> <p>Larcher should be better known to a wider public. His music has the quirky richness of a coat made not only of rainbow colours, but of every conceivable fabric: a sonic equivalent of feathers, velvet, net, silk, brushed steel, burlap, lace. Out of a jangle of steel pans, tubular bells and thunder sheets, a fragment of radiant chorale or counterpoint might emerge. Much of the solo vocal writing has the power of song while some, as in the high coloratura writing for Shoko \u2013 superbly sung by the French soprano <a href=\"http://www.sarah-aristidou.com/biography/\" title=\"\">Sarah Aristidou</a> \u2013 becomes part of the orchestral texture. Samuel Boden (Poet), Giulia Peri (Midori), Iris van Wijnen (Saiko) and Peter Sch\u00f6ne (Josuke Misugi) were in all respects first class in Karl Markovics\u2019s clean, cool production: a play of sun, clouds, snow, moving as a video backdrop to the simple white frame and narrow gully \u2013 \u201cnarrow path\u201d or \u201cwhite riverbed\u201d \u2013 of Katharina W\u00f6ppermann\u2019s designs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c08c106a5b5dcb26cfd2969685f956783533fe37\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08c106a5b5dcb26cfd2969685f956783533fe37/0_0_4349_3262/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tenebrae perform at Blythburgh church as part of Aldeburgh festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tenebrae perform at Blythburgh church as part of Aldeburgh festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Natural phenomena played an equal part, perfectly timed and without mechanical assistance, at Blythburgh church, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.holytrinityblythburgh.org.uk/\" title=\"\">cathedral of the marshes</a>\u201d, for a vocal concert by <strong><a href=\"https://www.tenebrae-choir.com/\" title=\"\">Tenebrae</a></strong> and its director, Nigel Short. Unaccompanied choral singing comes no better than this: in blend, accuracy, precision, commitment. Marking the 60th birthday of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/13/cumnock-tryst-review-james-macmillan-royal-scottish-national-orchestra-sondergard\" title=\"\">James MacMillan</a>, the ensemble interspersed his <em>Tenebrae Responsories</em> and <em>Miserere</em> with music by Byrd and Tallis, tacitly exploring the Roman Catholic origins of these composers from both Elizabethan eras. As this brilliant small choir sang MacMillan\u2019s Tenebrae factae sunt (Darkness fell), in which chromatic scales and ornament are overlaid in luminous clusters, their music almost seemed to challenge the setting sun itself. The last, low rays momentarily flooded the church with light and shadow, before 16 altar candles (and a couple of essential spotlights) took over the job and saved us all from universal darkness.</p> <p>That kind of magic didn\u2019t entirely ignite Glyndebourne\u2019s staging of Massenet\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://www.glyndebourne.com/events/cendrillon/\" title=\"\">Cendrillon</a></strong>, in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RuvEwU0kro\" title=\"\">Fiona Shaw\u2019s 2018 production</a> first seen on tour and, new to the main festival, revived by Fiona Dunn. There\u2019s no shortage of charm. If anything, excess is the weakness. Dreams and Freudian adventures, revolving mirrors, suit bags zipped up and down suggestive of chrysalis and butterfly, a suicidal overdose, a trouser role prince (Kate Lindsey) who ends up wearing a maid\u2019s dress, all clutter the simple tale of Cinderella. In the title role, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/20/unsung-heroines-women-composers-maconchy-bbc4-danielle-de-niese\" title=\"\">Danielle de Niese</a> is sympathetic and appealing. She can move, she can dance, and act, but on first night her voice sounded not quite focused. The sisters, extravagantly played by Julie Pasturaud and Eduarda Melo, took pleasure in their vulgar celebrity shopping trips, with Agnes Zwierko game as their mutton-as-lamb mother. Top singing came from one performer: Nina Minasyan as the silver-toned Fairy Godmother. John Wilson, conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, pointed up the sensuous enchantment of Massenet\u2019s score. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be seduced by this ponderous opera however it\u2019s done. The audience was more cheerfully disposed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68a4d175a3a3e20574d04ea4b962dcb9889e53ee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68a4d175a3a3e20574d04ea4b962dcb9889e53ee/0_303_5000_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Danielle de Niese in the title role of Cendrillon at Glyndebourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danielle de Niese in the title role of Cendrillon at Glyndebourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Hubert Smith/Glyndebourne Productions Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No jokes or magic, but religion and politics: Grange Park Opera chose Verdi\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://grangeparkopera.co.uk/whats-on/don-carlo/\" title=\"\">Don Carlo</a></strong>, in the four-act Italian version, for its season opener. Jo Davies\u2019s imposing staging was first seen in the company\u2019s previous, Hampshire base in 2016. This was its first outing to its <a href=\"https://grangeparkopera.co.uk/\" title=\"\">new West Horsley home</a>, now in its third year. The theatre\u2019s excellent acoustics enhanced the work\u2019s power and immediacy. Gianluca Marciano conducted with pace and insight, persuading the orchestra of English National Opera to show their best Italianate fervour. Crowd scenes and auto-da-f\u00e9 proved overwhelming, while the private episodes were intense and communicative. Clive Bayley\u2019s pensive, angry Philip II and Leonardo Capalbo\u2019s impetuous Carlo headed a strong cast, with Marina Costa-Jackson as Elisabetta, Ruxandra Donose as Eboli and Brett Polegato as Posa. This penumbrous staging, elegantly designed by Gabrielle Dalton, has enough flames, flickers and flares to heat a reasonably large house.

Natural phenomena played an equal part, perfectly timed and without mechanical assistance, at Blythburgh church, the \u201ccathedral of the marshes\u201d, for a vocal concert by Tenebrae and its director, Nigel Short. Unaccompanied choral singing comes no better than this: in blend, accuracy, precision, commitment. Marking the 60th birthday of James MacMillan, the ensemble interspersed his Tenebrae Responsories and Miserere with music by Byrd and Tallis, tacitly exploring the Roman Catholic origins of these composers from both Elizabethan eras. As this brilliant small choir sang MacMillan\u2019s Tenebrae factae sunt (Darkness fell), in which chromatic scales and ornament are overlaid in luminous clusters, their music almost seemed to challenge the setting sun itself. The last, low rays momentarily flooded the church with light and shadow, before 16 altar candles (and a couple of essential spotlights) took over the job and saved us all from universal darkness. That kind of magic didn\u2019t entirely ignite Glyndebourne\u2019s staging of Massenet\u2019s Cendrillon, in Fiona Shaw\u2019s 2018 production first seen on tour and, new to the main festival, revived by Fiona Dunn. There\u2019s no shortage of charm. If anything, excess is the weakness. Dreams and Freudian adventures, revolving mirrors, suit bags zipped up and down suggestive of chrysalis and butterfly, a suicidal overdose, a trouser role prince (Kate Lindsey) who ends up wearing a maid\u2019s dress, all clutter the simple tale of Cinderella. In the title role, Danielle de Niese is sympathetic and appealing. She can move, she can dance, and act, but on first night her voice sounded not quite focused. The sisters, extravagantly played by Julie Pasturaud and Eduarda Melo, took pleasure in their vulgar celebrity shopping trips, with Agnes Zwierko game as their mutton-as-lamb mother. Top singing came from one performer: Nina Minasyan as the silver-toned Fairy Godmother. John Wilson, conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra, pointed up the sensuous enchantment of Massenet\u2019s score. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be seduced by this ponderous opera however it\u2019s done. The audience was more cheerfully disposed. No jokes or magic, but religion and politics: Grange Park Opera chose Verdi\u2019s Don Carlo, in the four-act Italian version, for its season opener. Jo Davies\u2019s imposing staging was first seen in the company\u2019s previous, Hampshire base in 2016. This was its first outing to its new West Horsley home, now in its third year. The theatre\u2019s excellent acoustics enhanced the work\u2019s power and immediacy. Gianluca Marciano conducted with pace and insight, persuading the orchestra of English National Opera to show their best Italianate fervour. Crowd scenes and auto-da-f\u00e9 proved overwhelming, while the private episodes were intense and communicative. Clive Bayley\u2019s pensive, angry Philip II and Leonardo Capalbo\u2019s impetuous Carlo headed a strong cast, with Marina Costa-Jackson as Elisabetta, Ruxandra Donose as Eboli and Brett Polegato as Posa. This penumbrous staging, elegantly designed by Gabrielle Dalton, has enough flames, flickers and flares to heat a reasonably large house. Given current temperatures, it may prove the canniest of all country-house opera options. Star ratings (out of five) The Hunting Gun/Tenebrae \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Cendrillon \u2605\u2605\u2605 Don Carlo \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 The Aldeburgh festival continues until 29 June Cendrillon is in rep at Glyndebourne, East Sussex, until 2 Aug Don Carlo is in rep at Grange Park Opera, West Horsley, Surrey, until 9 July",

But something in their album, <em>All Ashore</em>, had caught the zeitgeist. And it was probably their song about Donald Trump Jr.</p> <p>Bluegrass has no history of protest music. Or rather, its protest has always been a passive, melancholic one, the sound of displaced workers longing for their home in the Blue Ridge Mountains far away. It is a music whose roots are bedded so deep in its nostalgic view of America that it can seem estranged from the modern world \u2013 and vice versa.</p> <p>In 1929, Bill Monroe left his home in Kentucky and headed north: he was 17 years old, and an orphan. Since his parents died, he had lived in a two-room log cabin in the woods with his uncle. Uncle Pen was a fiddle player who made a living playing at local square dances, with Bill by his side on mandolin and guitar. But these were the depression years, and there was no work in the south for young men. So Bill took the road through Indiana and joined his older brothers Birch and Charlie at an oil refinery on the shores of Lake Michigan, outside Chicago.</p> <p>The three brothers had played music together as boys, and their skills proved popular.

A keening for home flowed through their instruments as they sang of the mothers and sweethearts they\u2019d left behind, of their little cabin home on the hill.

Within 10 years, Elvis was rock\u2019n\u2019rolling, and the arrival of electric instruments made the acoustic string band sound old-fashioned overnight. Bluegrass was written off as hillbilly music. As for the poor banjo, its noisy jangle became the punchline to a thousand jokes.</p> <p>Books and films have only reinforced the stereotype. The scene in which a pair of musicians face off on a porch in the Burt Reynolds and Jon Voight movie <em>Deliverance</em>, and the catchy ditty they play, \u201cDuelling Banjos\u201d, have been parodied by everyone from the Muppets to <em>Father Ted</em>. When he wrote the duel in the 1970 novel the film was based on, James Dickey could not have known that he was creating the most famous banjo meme of all time.</p> <p>With its horror plot, often seen as a Vietnam war allegory, about four city men who take a canoeing trip in the Appalachians and find themselves hunted by hostile locals, <em>Deliverance</em> did not help anyone achieve a nuanced understanding of bluegrass\u2019s regional home. But still, the playing of communal music in the book \u2013 between farm boy Lonnie and the urban Drew \u2013 is a rare moment of peaceful connection between the two warring cultures.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The spirit of creativity that lives in the music was always going to attract artists who want to take it somewhere new</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cDrew slid down and went over and stood beside Lonnie,\u201d wrote Dickey, who used to pick bluegrass ballads on his guitar in the mornings before he wrote. \u201cThey put the instruments together and leaned close to each other in the pose you see vocal groups and phony folk singers take on TV programs, and something rare and unrepeatable took hold of the way I saw them, the demented country kid and the big-faced city man, the minor civic leader and hedge clipper.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a surprise, in some ways, that a music so evocative of the south and its early 20th century history hasn\u2019t made it into more US fiction. There\u2019s a hint of it in Adriana Trigiani\u2019s 2000 novel Big Stone Gap, which includes a moving encounter with the music at the Carter Family Fold venue. Charles Frazier\u2019s award-winning Civil War novel, Cold Mountain, is too early for bluegrass \u2013 its characters play the traditional fiddle-and-banjo tunes that were the music\u2019s precursor \u2013 but Frazier was clearly a fan, sprinkling his dialogue with Easter egg references to famous bluegrass songs (\u201cCan\u2019t you hear me calling?\u201d asks one character, directly quoting Bill Monroe\u2019s most famous song title).</p> <p>But Southern Nobel laureate William Faulkner never wrote of it, nor has Cormac McCarthy. Perhaps it\u2019s an issue of geographical constraints \u2013 bluegrass\u2019s popularity remains concentrated in a small portion of the southern Appalachian mountains, where the state lines of Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Tennessee converge. More likely it has simply been considered unworthy of notice: low art, uncomfortably associated with white redneck culture.</p> <p>Something is changing, though. Acoustic music, live and unfiltered, is in vogue. This year\u2019s Oscars ceremony featured two musicians known for their contribution to bluegrass music \u2013 Gillian Welch and Dave Rawlings, who have worked on numerous Coen brothers films, including, most recently, <em>The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</em>. Last year, Chris Stapleton, the country star who made his name as the lead singer with bluegrass outfit the Steeldrivers, duetted with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/lady-gaga\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga</a>.</p> <p>America\u2019s hipster generation, in its continual search for authenticity, is chasing roots music back to the country\u2019s earliest string bands, and their sound is being replicated in trendy bars in New York, Los Angeles and London. But it\u2019s also finding its way into concert halls. Cellist Yo-Yo Ma is one of a number of classical musicians who have reached out to embrace instrumentalists whose virtuosity is a mirror image of their own. This year Carnegie Hall awarded Chris Thile, the mandolin-playing genius behind bluegrass bands Nickel Creek and Punch Brothers, a prestigious Composer\u2019s Chair residency.</p> <p>At this fractured moment in US history, no other genre sits so precariously on the faultline of America\u2019s political divide. Bluegrass is the folk tradition of the south. You learn it at your father\u2019s knee (it\u2019s still heavily male-dominated) and play it communally in informal jam sessions, or \u201cpicking circles\u201d. As improvisatory as jazz, it has a competitive spirit that derives from the way solos are passed around, each instrument trying to one-up what came before. But despite the machismo, it remains a fundamentally democratic and social music. If you can hold your own in the circle, you\u2019re welcome there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de202a00d6662a19143584a760cc5237acd9c756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de202a00d6662a19143584a760cc5237acd9c756/0_288_5040_3024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rhiannon Giddens\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reclaiming the music\u2019s African American influences ...

It was the folk revival on the east and west coasts that rescued it from an early grave as country radio stations abandoned it for a smoother, more mainstream sound. In 1959, Scruggs played at the inaugural Newport folk festival in Rhode Island and the same year, an Esquire article introduced bluegrass \u2013 which it called \u201cfolk music on overdrive\u201d \u2013 to its urban readers. The genre found a new audience just as it was threatening to pass into obscurity.</p> <p>No trendspotter could have predicted the peculiar cultural exchange that followed. The middle-class city kids encountering bluegrass at college gigs shared little common life experience with the blue-collar performers who had worked in mines and factories, or grown up on dirt farms. Not just their upbringings: their political and religious beliefs \u2013 not to mention their manner of speech and sense of style \u2013 were poles apart. Yet at festival campgrounds, the good old boys of Kentucky, the Carolinas and Tennessee were soon discovering that their new fanbase didn\u2019t just enjoy listening to their songs. They could play them, too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/17/music-american-bluegrass-festival-telluride\">My love affair with the American bluegrass festival</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This influx of outsiders had consequences that have been fought over ever since. The music\u2019s urban aficionados began pushing its boundaries as far as they knew how: copying the jazz stylings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/02/bill-keith\" title=\"\">Bill Keith</a>, Tony Trischka and Bela Fleck in the north-east; embracing rock and psychedelia in Colorado, and in California, where a young <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/15/the-night-i-got-high-with-jerry-garcia\" title=\"\">Jerry Garcia</a> once picked banjo. By the 70s, artists such as Sam Bush adopted the term \u201cnewgrass\u201d to describe their sound; 40 years later, he and his peers are considered part of the bluegrass canon. Monroe acted as the ultimate gatekeeper; his trademark mutter, \u201cthat ain\u2019t no part of nothing\u201d, was deployed whenever he heard something he found less than acceptable. Bluegrass became a fiercely contested definition, with strict rules covering everything from rhythm (must have a dominant offbeat) to instrumentation (no electric instruments, no drums \u2013 only guitar, banjo, mandolin, fiddle, Dobro (resonator guitar) and bass are allowable). The irony is that Monroe and the bluegrass pioneers were the avant garde of their times, and the improvisational spirit that lives in the music was always going to attract the kind of artists who want to take it somewhere new.</p> <p>The result is a conflict that runs through the core of the music\u2019s culture. In its southern heartland, artists such as Del McCoury, Doyle Lawson and Junior Sisk maintain the music\u2019s original stylings. Their audience is conservative, Christian and fond of the old ways; there are gospel numbers, and songs about how things used to be better in daddy\u2019s day. Meanwhile, a progressive, metropolitan scene is, arguably, securing the music\u2019s future. From the highly trained brilliance of Ivy League graduates such as Brittany Haas to the rollicking rock of stadium-fillers Greensky Bluegrass and Trampled By Turtles, their genre-bending efforts are reaching audiences younger and many hundreds of times larger than anything the traditionalists can hope for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"589a2ad8e5f174482cadbcab3aaa3c48568535e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/589a2ad8e5f174482cadbcab3aaa3c48568535e6/0_0_1280_649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Doorstep duel \u2026 the 1972 film adaptation of Deliverance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"507\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doorstep duel \u2026 the 1972 film adaptation of Deliverance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Which means that this music is becoming increasingly politically potent. For many decades, bluegrass standards have focused on a few select topics: moonshine-fuelled nights and Sunday morning repentance, love gone wrong and murder ballads (usually a subset of love gone wrong). Last year a band called Che Apalache, which includes members from Mexico and Argentina, toured the rural south for the first time. Their effervescent playing won over the traditionalist die-hards, and that goodwill earned them the right to bring their own Latino slant to the music \u2013 and to sing their hard-hitting protest song, \u201cThe Wall\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of talk \u2019bout building a wall \u2026 between me and you,\u201d they sang, to audiences who had voted for that wall. \u201cLord, and if such nonsense should come true, then, we\u2019ll have to knock it down.\u201d</p> <p>Performers such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/24/rhiannon-giddens-songs-of-our-native-daughters-interview\" title=\"\">Rhiannon Giddens</a> are reclaiming the music\u2019s African American roots. Giddens\u2019 group the Carolina Chocolate Drops restores the tradition of the black string band that had been all but written out of bluegrass history, telling stories of the black American experience, from slave children to police shootings. Perhaps the most radical influence in bluegrass right now, however, is a grassroots group called Bluegrass Pride. Formed two years ago by a couple of San Francisco pickers with the simple goal of entering a float in the city\u2019s Pride parade, they have grown into a powerful voice for diversity and inclusivity in a musical community that is still overwhelmingly white and male. It isn\u2019t easy. Some of the biggest stars in traditional bluegrass still refuse to employ gay musicians on religious grounds. Some of the best female players struggle to get auditions for band spots. LGBT and women\u2019s rights in the south remain under constant threat, be it via Alabama\u2019s abortion ban or North Carolina\u2019s (since repealed) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/30/north-carolina-bathroom-bill-roy-cooper-deal\" title=\"\">bathroom bill</a>\u201d, which would have criminalised transgender people who used a different public toilet from that of their birth gender.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/24/rhiannon-giddens-songs-of-our-native-daughters-interview\">Rhiannon Giddens: \u2018I see this album as part of a movement to reclaim black female history\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And yet Bluegrass Pride has revealed the secret magic at the heart of this music. Because of its fundamentally social tradition \u2013 and the democracy of the picking circle \u2013 bluegrass is unique in the wider culture war: a rare public space where both sides of the great American divide can and will sit down together. The passion and pride that bluegrassers feel for their music override political, and even personal, animosity, forging unlikely friendships, challenging innate prejudices.</p> <p>It\u2019s an unexpected legacy for a music that still carries so much baggage. But then bluegrass, with its arcane rules and rapid execution, has always been full of mysteries. \u201cThrough everything he played there was a lovely unimpeded flowing that seemed endless,\u201d Dickey wrote of his musical prodigy Lonnie in <em>Deliverance</em>. \u201cThe fingers moved only slightly about like those of a good typist; the music was just there.\u201d The banjo is a far more subtle instrument than anyone wants to believe.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Wayfaring Stranger by Emma John is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson (RRP \u00a316.99).

In its southern heartland, artists such as Del McCoury, Doyle Lawson and Junior Sisk maintain the music\u2019s original stylings. Their audience is conservative, Christian and fond of the old ways; there are gospel numbers, and songs about how things used to be better in daddy\u2019s day. Meanwhile, a progressive, metropolitan scene is, arguably, securing the music\u2019s future. From the highly trained brilliance of Ivy League graduates such as Brittany Haas to the rollicking rock of stadium-fillers Greensky Bluegrass and Trampled By Turtles, their genre-bending efforts are reaching audiences younger and many hundreds of times larger than anything the traditionalists can hope for. Which means that this music is becoming increasingly politically potent. For many decades, bluegrass standards have focused on a few select topics: moonshine-fuelled nights and Sunday morning repentance, love gone wrong and murder ballads (usually a subset of love gone wrong). Last year a band called Che Apalache, which includes members from Mexico and Argentina, toured the rural south for the first time. Their effervescent playing won over the traditionalist die-hards, and that goodwill earned them the right to bring their own Latino slant to the music \u2013 and to sing their hard-hitting protest song, \u201cThe Wall\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of talk \u2019bout building a wall \u2026 between me and you,\u201d they sang, to audiences who had voted for that wall. \u201cLord, and if such nonsense should come true, then, we\u2019ll have to knock it down.\u201d Performers such as Rhiannon Giddens are reclaiming the music\u2019s African American roots. Giddens\u2019 group the Carolina Chocolate Drops restores the tradition of the black string band that had been all but written out of bluegrass history, telling stories of the black American experience, from slave children to police shootings. Perhaps the most radical influence in bluegrass right now, however, is a grassroots group called Bluegrass Pride. Formed two years ago by a couple of San Francisco pickers with the simple goal of entering a float in the city\u2019s Pride parade, they have grown into a powerful voice for diversity and inclusivity in a musical community that is still overwhelmingly white and male. It isn\u2019t easy. Some of the biggest stars in traditional bluegrass still refuse to employ gay musicians on religious grounds. Some of the best female players struggle to get auditions for band spots. LGBT and women\u2019s rights in the south remain under constant threat, be it via Alabama\u2019s abortion ban or North Carolina\u2019s (since repealed) \u201cbathroom bill\u201d, which would have criminalised transgender people who used a different public toilet from that of their birth gender. And yet Bluegrass Pride has revealed the secret magic at the heart of this music. Because of its fundamentally social tradition \u2013 and the democracy of the picking circle \u2013 bluegrass is unique in the wider culture war: a rare public space where both sides of the great American divide can and will sit down together. The passion and pride that bluegrassers feel for their music override political, and even personal, animosity, forging unlikely friendships, challenging innate prejudices. It\u2019s an unexpected legacy for a music that still carries so much baggage. But then bluegrass, with its arcane rules and rapid execution, has always been full of mysteries. \u201cThrough everything he played there was a lovely unimpeded flowing that seemed endless,\u201d Dickey wrote of his musical prodigy Lonnie in Deliverance. \u201cThe fingers moved only slightly about like those of a good typist; the music was just there.\u201d The banjo is a far more subtle instrument than anyone wants to believe. \u2022 Wayfaring Stranger by Emma John is published by Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson (RRP \u00a316.99).

      "body": "<p>Odette Traby was dying. It was the summer of 2016 and the sun baked the terracotta roofs of her hometown, Elne, in the south of France, as she lay in bed. Weeks earlier, the 78-year-old had been diagnosed with stage IV cancer. This grande dame of Elne town life had refused all treatment and chosen to tough it out alone. \u201cShe was someone who wanted to grapple with, to face up to, death,\u201d says Dani Delay, her niece.</p> <p>Traby had one consolation. She had spent the previous months trying to secure the future of her life\u2019s work, the town\u2019s art museum. It was dedicated to the work of the local artist \u00c9tienne Terrus (1857-1922), a friend of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/matisse\" title=\"\">Henri Matisse</a> who had been largely forgotten by the time Traby established the museum in the mid-90s. When nearly 60 Terruses came on to the market in 2015, Traby rallied two local historical associations to raise tens of thousands of euros, securing at least 30 of the works. As her life ebbed, at least Traby could tell herself that her beloved museum was closer to gaining the \u201cMus\u00e9e de France\u201d status that would give it priority state funding and resources.</p> <p>There was just one problem. On 27 April 2018, more than 18 months after Traby\u2019s death, Elne\u2019s mayor stood at the inauguration of the renovated Mus\u00e9e Terrus and announced to the public that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/french-museum-discovers-half-collection-fakes\" title=\"\">nearly </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/french-museum-discovers-half-collection-fakes\" title=\"\">60% of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/30/french-museum-discovers-half-collection-fakes\" title=\"\">its collection was fake</a>. The mayor, Yves Barniol, had known for months; 82 works out of a total of 140, worth approximately \u20ac160,000 (\u00a3140,000), had already been seized by the gendarmerie in nearby Perpignan. Barniol was soon fielding calls from the New York Times, the BBC, Al Jazeera and the Japan Times. Despite the embarrassment, he felt it was better to come clean. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a shock,\u201d he tells me later. \u201cBut 60,000 people have seen these fakes over the last 15 years \u2013 that\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d</p> <p>The Terrus affair represents a new kind of art crime, driven by what one French radio station has called \u201clow-cost fakes\u201d. As it has become harder for forgers to penetrate the top tiers of a global art market saturated with counterfeits \u2013 a figure of as many as 50% is often cited \u2013 they are thought to have turned to lesser works. Prior to the scandal, a genuine Terrus was not exorbitant, selling for up to \u20ac6,000. We now live in a broader culture of inauthenticity \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/12/deep-fakes-fake-news-truth\" title=\"\">\u201cdeepfake\u201d Barack Obama videos</a>, Russian troll factories \u2013 but many of the alleged Terrus fakes were sloppy. Why had the experts, whose job it was to prevent this from happening, failed so badly? If Traby loved Terrus so much, how could she not have spotted them? How much did the people around her know? And who painted the fakes that entered the museum with such distressing ease?</p> <p>***</p> <p>I take a stroll around Elne on the first day of June 2018. It is a calm huddle of 8,500 people who live around a fortified hill, nine miles north of the Spanish border in the Pyren\u00e9es-Orientales <em>d\u00e9partement</em>; Hannibal pitched camp here when it went by the name Illiberis and was the regional capital. The blue-gabled house where Terrus\u2019s descendants still live is next to the ramparts in the lower section of town. In the tourist office, I am warned that, due to an obscure feud, the family refuse to discuss the artist. When I ring their bell, a long-faced pensioner behind the gate swats me away: \u201c<em>Non!</em>\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were watercolours on paper that didn\u2019t look a century old, with a weft commonly available only after the war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/shortcuts/2018/apr/30/etienne-terrus-the-french-painter-whose-museum-is-full-of-fakes\" title=\"\">Eric Forcada</a>, the art historian who uncovered the fraud, lives eight miles away in Perpignan. Sitting at a table in an art deco cafe, he wears his politics on his breast \u2013 a yellow Catalan ribbon \u2013 and his trainers, the yellow-and-red <em>senyera</em> stripes. The 43-year-old smiles wryly as he explains his involvement. After Traby\u2019s death, he was chosen by the Elne municipality to oversee the renovation of Mus\u00e9e Terrus, making it ready to display the new works. As soon as he received images of them, at the end of August 2017, he knew something was wrong: \u201cI said to myself, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d</p> <p>There was barely any stylistic consistency among the new works. A lot were crude, \u201choliday-club\u201d stuff \u2013 not consistent with the work of the charged colourist who had captivated Matisse. Terrus spurned a Parisian academy education to paint nature in his backyard, the vigour and heat that ran through his work rooted in a strong Catalan identity.</p> <p>Further investigation into the museum\u2019s collection revealed more anomalies. On one painting, the signature came off when Forcada brushed it with a gloved hand. Another had been signed twice: Terrus and J Armengol. There were watercolours on perfect white paper that didn\u2019t look a century old, with a tight industrial weft commonly available only after the second world war.</p> <p>Most flagrant seemed to be the case of two oil paintings featuring the Ch\u00e2teau Royal at Collioure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/17/france-road-trip-perpignan-cathar-castles-spain-spanish-border\" title=\"\">the port </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/17/france-road-trip-perpignan-cathar-castles-spain-spanish-border\" title=\"\">a few miles </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/17/france-road-trip-perpignan-cathar-castles-spain-spanish-border\" title=\"\">south where Matisse jointly </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2017/jun/17/france-road-trip-perpignan-cathar-castles-spain-spanish-border\" title=\"\">established fauvism</a>, the movement that sounded the fanfare of modern art.

The day the public announcement was made, he started receiving calls from private collectors, who wanted him to verify their works by Terrus \u2013 and other artists. It became clear that the art market in Roussillon \u2013 the wider region containing Pyren\u00e9es-Orientales \u2013 was \u201cgangrenous\u201d; Forcada estimates there are hundreds of forgeries in circulation, among them 200 to 300 Terruses, worth as much as \u20ac1m.</p> <p>Most of these fakes are in private hands, but they sometimes end up in museums when they are lent for exhibitions. In May 2018, weeks after Forcada\u2019s discovery came to light, the Mus\u00e9e Rigaud, Perpignan\u2019s main art museum, allegedly withdrew two suspect paintings by Terrus\u2019s contemporary Augustin Hanicotte, lent by a private collector. Its director, Claire Muchir, later denied the works had been included in the exhibition, but one had featured on early publicity material. Another national museum, the Museum of Modern Art in C\u00e9ret, 14 miles south-west of Elne, is putting a large collection it has just been bequeathed under close scrutiny to avoid such embarrassment; Forcada, who has seen the works, believes 5% are \u201cdoubtful\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Traby had started to lose sight in one eye, possibly leaving her less able to spot red flags in the new acquisitions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Forcada thinks the forgers exploited the intensity of the Roussillon art market, with its mania for local artists. Many of this group were relatively little-known; their works were not valuable enough to be subject to the kind of scrutiny a Pablo Picasso, say, would undergo before auction. Surrounding the giants who came to work here in the 20th century\u2019s first decade \u2013 while Matisse and Andr\u00e9 Derain invented fauvism at Collioure, Picasso and Georges Braques workshopped cubism in the mountains at C\u00e9ret \u2013 was a tight-knit hub of locals, including Terrus, Hanicotte, Aristide Maillol, Gustave Fayet, George-Daniel de Monfreid and Madeleine Arnaud.</p> <p>A dapper gent in a pink blazer walks over to the cafe where we are talking and chips into our conversation. He is Michel Sitja, the director of the office of Perpignan\u2019s mayor. A collector himself, he has organised exhibitions and says he understands the local mentality. \u201cOften people buy a painting because it shows a bit of their village, not necessarily because of who painted it,\u201d he says. This, Forcada says, has translated into a \u201cnarcissism\u201d susceptible to exploitation \u2013 particularly if, like Odette Traby, you are in a position to set up a museum.</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m the only one to bear her name,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Traby, Odette\u2019s nephew. \u201cEvery time I introduce myself, I have to say, yes, she was my aunt. And they always say, \u2018Oooh, what a character!\u2019\u201d Weeks later, he and I are in a Perpignan lawyer\u2019s office with his cousin Delay. They are her closest living relatives (she had no children) and have never talked to the press before.</p> <p>They tell me about the force of nature who was their aunt: \u201cShe was a militant, passionate in everything she did,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. She had been a biology teacher, a trade unionist, five times a cultural adjunct and the founder of a Catalan music festival, as well as the town\u2019s first girls\u2019 basketball team. But she could be brusque and authoritarian. The social club she founded for Elne\u2019s art aficionados was named Le Cercle des Authentiques Cabochards (\u201cThe Circle of Old Gits\u201d). With her austere dress sense, she had the air of someone dedicated monastically to higher things. Perhaps she saw in Terrus, regarded in his time as a wild \u201cbear\u201d with no time for bourgeois propriety, a fellow iconoclast. She took up his cause with complete dedication.</p> <p>Traby set up Mus\u00e9e Terrus with her long-term partner, Michel Briqueu. After his death in 1994, she became the leading authority on the artist. Annie P\u00e9zin, who succeeded Traby as Elne\u2019s cultural adjunct in 2008, deferred to her on matters relating to Terrus, perhaps calamitously in the case of the town hall\u2019s 2013 acquisition of 16 Terruses, now also in police hands. \u201cYou have to understand it in the context of the town, which isn\u2019t big. And her strong personality,\u201d says P\u00e9zin, a small, alert woman squinting uneasily through heavy-rimmed glasses over a picnic table in her garden. Traby rarely doubted her own mind, agrees Nicolas Garcia, Barniol\u2019s predecessor as mayor, who fenced with her over the price of acquisitions. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t haggle over art like a carpet,\u2019 she\u2019d say.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7adc742c199ffc077493ad62d7107508656f8684\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7adc742c199ffc077493ad62d7107508656f8684/0_199_1480_1293/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Etienne Terrus fake of Chateau Royal at Collioure with the flat tower.

But after Barniol and his rightwing administration was voted into office in early 2014, she pushed harder for acquisitions \u2013 fearful of losing her influence over the museum. She had started to lose sight in one eye, possibly leaving her less able to spot red flags in the new acquisitions. \u201cThe only thing she\u2019s guilty of is believing too much,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. \u201cOf having believed she knew enough, when in the end she was cheated.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>I decide to dig into the provenance of the Terruses. The vast majority were acquired by the museum\u2019s steering body, the Terrus committee, which consisted of Traby; G\u00e9rard Rouqui\u00e9 and Alain Lesage, two Perpignan art dealers; and a twentysomething intern who is now in ill-health. Lesage sold the artworks, acquired over many years, to the museum. Rouqui\u00e9 \u2013 a well-known figure in the Roussillon art-dealing world \u2013 authenticated them.</p> <p>By July 2018, three months after Barniol\u2019s revelation, the Mus\u00e9e Terrus case has passed <em>en instruction</em> \u2013 a higher tier of investigation led by an examining magistrate reserved for more serious crimes, often involving an organised ring. The mood is tense. A few weeks earlier, Forcada was interviewed by the police for five and a half hours, to see if he had any vested interests in outing the Elne fakes. The case isn\u2019t moving as fast as he had hoped.</p> <p>I find Rouqui\u00e9 and Lesage\u2019s peach-fronted shop in a poky square round the corner from the cathedral. No one answers the bell. I peer up the three-storey facade; latticed shutters have been drawn halfway down the windows. Someone taps me on the shoulder. It is the waiter from the cafe opposite, who has seen me snooping: \u201cThey\u2019re always up there looking out. They can see you, but you can\u2019t see them.\u201d</p> <p>Finally, Rouqui\u00e9 comes to the door. Wearing jogging bottoms and a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cLondon\u201d, the wiry 79-year-old rocks on his heels in his doorway. What does he, as the authenticating expert, make of the declaration of the Elne paintings as fake? \u201c<em>La montagne accouche d\u2019une souris</em>,\u201d he says (\u201cThey\u2019ve made a mountain out of a molehill\u201d). \u201cThere are maybe some doubts about 10% of the collection, but I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re getting 60% from.\u201d He retired as an active dealer in 2001 and installed Lesage, his business partner, to replace him. The police still haven\u2019t formally interviewed him, he tells me, but they have seized documents related to his work on the Terrus committee.</p> <p>When we meet again a few months later, Rouqui\u00e9 tells me he met Traby for the first time in the mid-00s when she saw a watercolour by Terrus in his window. After they supplied her with more Terruses, she invited Rouqui\u00e9 and Lesage on to the museum committee. Although he issued the certificates of authenticity as a formality, it was Traby who made the real decisions, he says. (The intern on the committee later tells me Rouqui\u00e9 had much more sway than this.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bc5fe468613acb01624d02eb152a95c1d4c5d3f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc5fe468613acb01624d02eb152a95c1d4c5d3f4/0_1422_4984_3967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Art historian Eric Forcada at his home in Perpignan, France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"796\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eric Forcada, the art historian who uncovered the fraud.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Aranda/Panos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The committee had little expertise in Terrus\u2019s work: Rouqui\u00e9 was the only member with any relevant qualifications. He says he saw no conflict of interest in authenticating the paintings sold by his partner: \u201cIt\u2019s totally normal, within the rules. In Paris, there are plenty of people on committees who buy and sell.\u201d (A British expert tells me it is true that the French system is far more laissez-faire.) Regarding the improbable stylistic variation among the works, Rouqui\u00e9 argues that Terrus \u201cdid a bit of everything\u201d. He claims the industrial watercolour paper dates back to 1880, and that in certain circumstances it can weather decades unscathed.</p> <p>What about the tower anachronism? \u201cThe painter paints what he sees, but also what he imagines. All the greatest painters did it. If I say: \u2018When Terrus painted it, he decided to give it a different roof,\u2019 who can prove the contrary?\u201d But the precise roof that was built 40 years later on the same tower? Rouqui\u00e9 grinds his teeth. \u201cAll this saying, \u2018He couldn\u2019t have imagined a roof,\u2019 it\u2019s totally idiotic. As an expert in Terrus, I can say that\u2019s how he did things.\u201d</p> <p>The works offered to the two associations, he says, came from four sources, including two \u201cwheeler-dealers\u201d who had supplied him for many years, and a court bailiff auction that furnished a single oil painting. But most came from a \u201cMonsieur X\u201d, a former estate agent who lives in the region. Rouqui\u00e9 and Monsieur X only completed the transactions in April 2018, when Rouqui\u00e9 insisted he write him a formal receipt (now with the police). Rouqui\u00e9 claims he paid Monsieur X with luxury watches worth \u20ac25,000 and \u201cthousands\u201d in cash \u2013 not unusual for traders and collectors who want to avoid tax audits.</p> <p>He reiterates the details, reading off the deposition he has prepared for the <em>gendarmerie</em>. But instead of referring to Monsieur X, as he has throughout our interview, he lets slip a name: Monsieur Amiel. I have no idea if he has done it deliberately or not, but I note it down.</p> <p>***</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s fucked us all!\u201d says Franck Amiel, bounding around his living room, when I repeat Rouqui\u00e9\u2019s version of events. \u201cIf I see him, I\u2019ll smash his face in.\u201d Two spaniels yelp and bounce up and down near the windows, riffing off their owner\u2019s nervous energy. Amiel lives in a cavernous mansion in the village of St Paul de Fenouillet, about 20 miles west of Perpignan. He admits selling his collection to Lesage in 2016, but says it contained no Terruses. He says he is a victim in this scenario. He walks me up his staircase, pointing out several supposed fakes by local artists, some of the many artworks and antiques he says Rouqui\u00e9 has sold him since 2000.</p> <p>Is Amiel a perpetrator or a patsy? Forcada has declined to evaluate artwork shown to him by Amiel, because the estate agent\u2019s role in the affair is \u201cnot clear\u201d. Rouqui\u00e9 showed me his <em>livre</em><em> de </em><em>police</em>, a record book he is legally obliged to keep, detailing two batches of Terruses purchased from Amiel in October 2012 and May 2013. They were not among the 30-odd works that ended up in the museum through the Elne associations; Rouqui\u00e9 told me those sales took place off the books. But, he says, the October 2012 entry, for 16 works obtained from Amiel, corresponds to the sale signed off at Elne municipality in 2013 \u2013 the paintings that hung in the town hall. Rouqui\u00e9 steadfastly denies that he and Lesage knowingly acquired fakes from Amiel.</p> <p>If Amiel was the source of many of the paintings offered to the two associations, where did he get them? What was the origin of the other works that found their way into the museum collection, some as far back as 15 years ago? What of the 1,000 fakes believed to be in private hands?</p> <p>Forcada\u2019s hunch is that the Roussillon forgery network is split into two parts: one targeting the museums and bourgeois clients, another the more informal street markets and regional auction houses. Several antiques dealers I speak to claim that organised criminal networks often play a role in introducing China-produced fakes, which turn up at salons, flea markets and auction houses across France. Throughout my research, one name keeps cropping up: that of a local trader. Rouqui\u00e9\u2019s record book confirms that this mystery man is a supplier, one of the wheeler-dealers he mentioned in our first interview. A former police officer reveals that the man has sold forgeries to auction houses in Pyren\u00e9es-Orientales, possibly with their collusion. Auction houses pay by cheque, so the sales are documented but confidential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33f3c4f46a88daa1b10c0358589d91480119b37c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33f3c4f46a88daa1b10c0358589d91480119b37c/0_168_3958_2374/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artists Etienne Terrus (seated) and Henri Matisse (standing)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Terrus (seated) with his friend Matisse (standing).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: the Commune of Elne</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later, Rouqui\u00e9 talks me through the suppliers of most of the paintings offered to Elne\u2019s two associations, and of other alleged fakes. There are striking correspondences: the majority of the supposed acquisitions from the local wheeler-dealer either closely resemble authentic Terruses, or seem to have been copied from old postcards in the museum\u2019s 2002 catalogue. Could they be the work of a dedicated forger, as opposed to a hotchpotch by other artists later re-signed Terrus? Forcada believes there may be several forgers working under a kingpin, someone \u201celusive, remote and mysterious\u201d, as he puts it. But even if the local wheeler dealer is the mastermind, the ex-cop warns me against pursuing him: \u201cIt could finish badly for you. He\u2019s got nothing to lose.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>January 2019. People turn up at the Mus\u00e9e Terrus asking to see the fakes, but the police still have them. Visitor numbers are down. No one has been charged. The magistrate who led the investigation for six months has gone on sabbatical and been replaced by someone else, who has since left for unexplained reasons, leaving no one in charge.</p> <p>Rouqui\u00e9 receives me again in his office, recovering from a stomach operation made necessary by the pressure, he says. He still insists that most of the seized works are genuine. I don\u2019t know if he is lying, telling the truth or a cloudy cocktail of the two \u2013 that he convinced himself the paintings were by Terrus and let Traby take the responsibility. Meanwhile, Amiel refuses all requests for follow-up interviews and has put his house up for sale.</p> <p>Forcada is impatient but resolute. Some people believe the historian\u2019s Catalan allegiances have led him to hold Terrus in too high regard, and to overestimate the number of fakes in circulation. It is clear a lot of the alleged forgeries are leaden and pedantic; but in Paris a collector shows me a genuine Terrus, a watercolour that is nearly as uninspired. The artist did have his off-days.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jun/15/how-to-spot-a-perfect-fake-the-worlds-top-art-forgery-detective\">How to spot a perfect fake: the world\u2019s top art forgery detective</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Forcada is calling for a clean-up of the market led by state museums \u2013 for example, by offering their expertise to private collectors. He believes the market could face an even greater crisis in a few decades\u2019 time when the current generation of collectors dies and their fakes go up for sale. Ultimately, he wants to encourage a change of philosophy among collectors. \u201cWe have to get everyone on the same page, so we\u2019re not drawn necessarily to fetishising a single work for its value, but to understanding the overall worth of an artist\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p>One person would have agreed. Once her work upholding Terrus was done, Traby organised her death with the same singlemindedness. She finally agreed to go into a palliative clinic \u2013 because of the pain, but also to give a prying neighbour the slip. She died on 4 August 2016, a year before Forcada blew things open. Only 10 people went to her funeral. Her niece and nephew, Delay and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, had been sworn to secrecy, even from other family members: their aunt didn\u2019t want Elne\u2019s professional mourners there, \u201ccrying crocodile tears\u201d. There were no speeches; just a friend, with whom Traby had founded her music festival, playing the flute. \u201cShe was the master of ceremonies until her final moments,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. \u201cThere are very few people like that: \u2018It\u2019s my life from A to Z and it\u2019s me who decides.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>She bequeathed 13 Terruses to the museum, authenticated by Rouqui\u00e9, which are now in the possession of the police. In her will, Traby asked for a room in Mus\u00e9e Terrus to take her name. She may not be remembered for the reasons she wanted, but hanging there are 19 paintings that speak for her undying love of art and truth.</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "Odette Traby was dying. It was the summer of 2016 and the sun baked the terracotta roofs of her hometown, Elne, in the south of France, as she lay in bed. Weeks earlier, the 78-year-old had been diagnosed with stage IV cancer. This grande dame of Elne town life had refused all treatment and chosen to tough it out alone. \u201cShe was someone who wanted to grapple with, to face up to, death,\u201d says Dani Delay, her niece. Traby had one consolation. She had spent the previous months trying to secure the future of her life\u2019s work, the town\u2019s art museum. It was dedicated to the work of the local artist \u00c9tienne Terrus (1857-1922), a friend of Henri Matisse who had been largely forgotten by the time Traby established the museum in the mid-90s. When nearly 60 Terruses came on to the market in 2015, Traby rallied two local historical associations to raise tens of thousands of euros, securing at least 30 of the works. As her life ebbed, at least Traby could tell herself that her beloved museum was closer to gaining the \u201cMus\u00e9e de France\u201d status that would give it priority state funding and resources. There was just one problem. On 27 April 2018, more than 18 months after Traby\u2019s death, Elne\u2019s mayor stood at the inauguration of the renovated Mus\u00e9e Terrus and announced to the public that nearly 60% of its collection was fake. The mayor, Yves Barniol, had known for months; 82 works out of a total of 140, worth approximately \u20ac160,000 (\u00a3140,000), had already been seized by the gendarmerie in nearby Perpignan. Barniol was soon fielding calls from the New York Times, the BBC, Al Jazeera and the Japan Times. Despite the embarrassment, he felt it was better to come clean. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a shock,\u201d he tells me later. \u201cBut 60,000 people have seen these fakes over the last 15 years \u2013 that\u2019s unforgivable.\u201d The Terrus affair represents a new kind of art crime, driven by what one French radio station has called \u201clow-cost fakes\u201d. As it has become harder for forgers to penetrate the top tiers of a global art market saturated with counterfeits \u2013 a figure of as many as 50% is often cited \u2013 they are thought to have turned to lesser works. Prior to the scandal, a genuine Terrus was not exorbitant, selling for up to \u20ac6,000. We now live in a broader culture of inauthenticity \u2013 \u201cdeepfake\u201d Barack Obama videos, Russian troll factories \u2013 but many of the alleged Terrus fakes were sloppy. Why had the experts, whose job it was to prevent this from happening, failed so badly? If Traby loved Terrus so much, how could she not have spotted them? How much did the people around her know? And who painted the fakes that entered the museum with such distressing ease? *** I take a stroll around Elne on the first day of June 2018. It is a calm huddle of 8,500 people who live around a fortified hill, nine miles north of the Spanish border in the Pyren\u00e9es-Orientales d\u00e9partement; Hannibal pitched camp here when it went by the name Illiberis and was the regional capital. The blue-gabled house where Terrus\u2019s descendants still live is next to the ramparts in the lower section of town. In the tourist office, I am warned that, due to an obscure feud, the family refuse to discuss the artist. When I ring their bell, a long-faced pensioner behind the gate swats me away: \u201cNon!\u201d Eric Forcada, the art historian who uncovered the fraud, lives eight miles away in Perpignan. Sitting at a table in an art deco cafe, he wears his politics on his breast \u2013 a yellow Catalan ribbon \u2013 and his trainers, the yellow-and-red senyera stripes. The 43-year-old smiles wryly as he explains his involvement. After Traby\u2019s death, he was chosen by the Elne municipality to oversee the renovation of Mus\u00e9e Terrus, making it ready to display the new works. As soon as he received images of them, at the end of August 2017, he knew something was wrong: \u201cI said to myself, it\u2019s not possible.\u201d There was barely any stylistic consistency among the new works. A lot were crude, \u201choliday-club\u201d stuff \u2013 not consistent with the work of the charged colourist who had captivated Matisse. Terrus spurned a Parisian academy education to paint nature in his backyard, the vigour and heat that ran through his work rooted in a strong Catalan identity. Further investigation into the museum\u2019s collection revealed more anomalies. On one painting, the signature came off when Forcada brushed it with a gloved hand. Another had been signed twice: Terrus and J Armengol. There were watercolours on perfect white paper that didn\u2019t look a century old, with a tight industrial weft commonly available only after the second world war. Most flagrant seemed to be the case of two oil paintings featuring the Ch\u00e2teau Royal at Collioure, the port a few miles south where Matisse jointly established fauvism, the movement that sounded the fanfare of modern art. The paintings featured a flat-roofed tower on the castle that had been renovated that way in 1957; by then, Terrus had been dead for 35 years. Backed up by three other specialists, Forcada explained his findings at a meeting of the two associations that had funded their purchase; his views were later corroborated by another expert, who must remain anonymous under the terms of an ongoing police investigation. \u201cPeople were shocked,\u201d says Forcada. \u201cHow could they have been fooled when they did everything in good faith?\u201d He soon realised he had stirred a hornets\u2019 nest. The day the public announcement was made, he started receiving calls from private collectors, who wanted him to verify their works by Terrus \u2013 and other artists. It became clear that the art market in Roussillon \u2013 the wider region containing Pyren\u00e9es-Orientales \u2013 was \u201cgangrenous\u201d; Forcada estimates there are hundreds of forgeries in circulation, among them 200 to 300 Terruses, worth as much as \u20ac1m. Most of these fakes are in private hands, but they sometimes end up in museums when they are lent for exhibitions. In May 2018, weeks after Forcada\u2019s discovery came to light, the Mus\u00e9e Rigaud, Perpignan\u2019s main art museum, allegedly withdrew two suspect paintings by Terrus\u2019s contemporary Augustin Hanicotte, lent by a private collector. Its director, Claire Muchir, later denied the works had been included in the exhibition, but one had featured on early publicity material. Another national museum, the Museum of Modern Art in C\u00e9ret, 14 miles south-west of Elne, is putting a large collection it has just been bequeathed under close scrutiny to avoid such embarrassment; Forcada, who has seen the works, believes 5% are \u201cdoubtful\u201d. Forcada thinks the forgers exploited the intensity of the Roussillon art market, with its mania for local artists. Many of this group were relatively little-known; their works were not valuable enough to be subject to the kind of scrutiny a Pablo Picasso, say, would undergo before auction. Surrounding the giants who came to work here in the 20th century\u2019s first decade \u2013 while Matisse and Andr\u00e9 Derain invented fauvism at Collioure, Picasso and Georges Braques workshopped cubism in the mountains at C\u00e9ret \u2013 was a tight-knit hub of locals, including Terrus, Hanicotte, Aristide Maillol, Gustave Fayet, George-Daniel de Monfreid and Madeleine Arnaud. A dapper gent in a pink blazer walks over to the cafe where we are talking and chips into our conversation. He is Michel Sitja, the director of the office of Perpignan\u2019s mayor. A collector himself, he has organised exhibitions and says he understands the local mentality. \u201cOften people buy a painting because it shows a bit of their village, not necessarily because of who painted it,\u201d he says. This, Forcada says, has translated into a \u201cnarcissism\u201d susceptible to exploitation \u2013 particularly if, like Odette Traby, you are in a position to set up a museum. *** \u201cI\u2019m the only one to bear her name,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Traby, Odette\u2019s nephew. \u201cEvery time I introduce myself, I have to say, yes, she was my aunt. And they always say, \u2018Oooh, what a character!\u2019\u201d Weeks later, he and I are in a Perpignan lawyer\u2019s office with his cousin Delay. They are her closest living relatives (she had no children) and have never talked to the press before. They tell me about the force of nature who was their aunt: \u201cShe was a militant, passionate in everything she did,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. She had been a biology teacher, a trade unionist, five times a cultural adjunct and the founder of a Catalan music festival, as well as the town\u2019s first girls\u2019 basketball team. But she could be brusque and authoritarian. The social club she founded for Elne\u2019s art aficionados was named Le Cercle des Authentiques Cabochards (\u201cThe Circle of Old Gits\u201d). With her austere dress sense, she had the air of someone dedicated monastically to higher things. Perhaps she saw in Terrus, regarded in his time as a wild \u201cbear\u201d with no time for bourgeois propriety, a fellow iconoclast. She took up his cause with complete dedication. Traby set up Mus\u00e9e Terrus with her long-term partner, Michel Briqueu. After his death in 1994, she became the leading authority on the artist. Annie P\u00e9zin, who succeeded Traby as Elne\u2019s cultural adjunct in 2008, deferred to her on matters relating to Terrus, perhaps calamitously in the case of the town hall\u2019s 2013 acquisition of 16 Terruses, now also in police hands. \u201cYou have to understand it in the context of the town, which isn\u2019t big. And her strong personality,\u201d says P\u00e9zin, a small, alert woman squinting uneasily through heavy-rimmed glasses over a picnic table in her garden. Traby rarely doubted her own mind, agrees Nicolas Garcia, Barniol\u2019s predecessor as mayor, who fenced with her over the price of acquisitions. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t haggle over art like a carpet,\u2019 she\u2019d say.\u201d No one I speak to questions Traby\u2019s integrity. But after Barniol and his rightwing administration was voted into office in early 2014, she pushed harder for acquisitions \u2013 fearful of losing her influence over the museum. She had started to lose sight in one eye, possibly leaving her less able to spot red flags in the new acquisitions. \u201cThe only thing she\u2019s guilty of is believing too much,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. \u201cOf having believed she knew enough, when in the end she was cheated.\u201d *** I decide to dig into the provenance of the Terruses. The vast majority were acquired by the museum\u2019s steering body, the Terrus committee, which consisted of Traby; G\u00e9rard Rouqui\u00e9 and Alain Lesage, two Perpignan art dealers; and a twentysomething intern who is now in ill-health. Lesage sold the artworks, acquired over many years, to the museum. Rouqui\u00e9 \u2013 a well-known figure in the Roussillon art-dealing world \u2013 authenticated them. By July 2018, three months after Barniol\u2019s revelation, the Mus\u00e9e Terrus case has passed en instruction \u2013 a higher tier of investigation led by an examining magistrate reserved for more serious crimes, often involving an organised ring. The mood is tense. A few weeks earlier, Forcada was interviewed by the police for five and a half hours, to see if he had any vested interests in outing the Elne fakes. The case isn\u2019t moving as fast as he had hoped. I find Rouqui\u00e9 and Lesage\u2019s peach-fronted shop in a poky square round the corner from the cathedral. No one answers the bell. I peer up the three-storey facade; latticed shutters have been drawn halfway down the windows. Someone taps me on the shoulder. It is the waiter from the cafe opposite, who has seen me snooping: \u201cThey\u2019re always up there looking out. They can see you, but you can\u2019t see them.\u201d Finally, Rouqui\u00e9 comes to the door. Wearing jogging bottoms and a T-shirt emblazoned with the word \u201cLondon\u201d, the wiry 79-year-old rocks on his heels in his doorway. What does he, as the authenticating expert, make of the declaration of the Elne paintings as fake? \u201cLa montagne accouche d\u2019une souris,\u201d he says (\u201cThey\u2019ve made a mountain out of a molehill\u201d). \u201cThere are maybe some doubts about 10% of the collection, but I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re getting 60% from.\u201d He retired as an active dealer in 2001 and installed Lesage, his business partner, to replace him. The police still haven\u2019t formally interviewed him, he tells me, but they have seized documents related to his work on the Terrus committee. When we meet again a few months later, Rouqui\u00e9 tells me he met Traby for the first time in the mid-00s when she saw a watercolour by Terrus in his window. After they supplied her with more Terruses, she invited Rouqui\u00e9 and Lesage on to the museum committee. Although he issued the certificates of authenticity as a formality, it was Traby who made the real decisions, he says. (The intern on the committee later tells me Rouqui\u00e9 had much more sway than this.) The committee had little expertise in Terrus\u2019s work: Rouqui\u00e9 was the only member with any relevant qualifications. He says he saw no conflict of interest in authenticating the paintings sold by his partner: \u201cIt\u2019s totally normal, within the rules. In Paris, there are plenty of people on committees who buy and sell.\u201d (A British expert tells me it is true that the French system is far more laissez-faire.) Regarding the improbable stylistic variation among the works, Rouqui\u00e9 argues that Terrus \u201cdid a bit of everything\u201d. He claims the industrial watercolour paper dates back to 1880, and that in certain circumstances it can weather decades unscathed. What about the tower anachronism? \u201cThe painter paints what he sees, but also what he imagines. All the greatest painters did it. If I say: \u2018When Terrus painted it, he decided to give it a different roof,\u2019 who can prove the contrary?\u201d But the precise roof that was built 40 years later on the same tower? Rouqui\u00e9 grinds his teeth. \u201cAll this saying, \u2018He couldn\u2019t have imagined a roof,\u2019 it\u2019s totally idiotic. As an expert in Terrus, I can say that\u2019s how he did things.\u201d The works offered to the two associations, he says, came from four sources, including two \u201cwheeler-dealers\u201d who had supplied him for many years, and a court bailiff auction that furnished a single oil painting. But most came from a \u201cMonsieur X\u201d, a former estate agent who lives in the region. Rouqui\u00e9 and Monsieur X only completed the transactions in April 2018, when Rouqui\u00e9 insisted he write him a formal receipt (now with the police). Rouqui\u00e9 claims he paid Monsieur X with luxury watches worth \u20ac25,000 and \u201cthousands\u201d in cash \u2013 not unusual for traders and collectors who want to avoid tax audits. He reiterates the details, reading off the deposition he has prepared for the gendarmerie. But instead of referring to Monsieur X, as he has throughout our interview, he lets slip a name: Monsieur Amiel. I have no idea if he has done it deliberately or not, but I note it down. *** \u201cHe\u2019s fucked us all!\u201d says Franck Amiel, bounding around his living room, when I repeat Rouqui\u00e9\u2019s version of events. \u201cIf I see him, I\u2019ll smash his face in.\u201d Two spaniels yelp and bounce up and down near the windows, riffing off their owner\u2019s nervous energy. Amiel lives in a cavernous mansion in the village of St Paul de Fenouillet, about 20 miles west of Perpignan. He admits selling his collection to Lesage in 2016, but says it contained no Terruses. He says he is a victim in this scenario. He walks me up his staircase, pointing out several supposed fakes by local artists, some of the many artworks and antiques he says Rouqui\u00e9 has sold him since 2000. Is Amiel a perpetrator or a patsy? Forcada has declined to evaluate artwork shown to him by Amiel, because the estate agent\u2019s role in the affair is \u201cnot clear\u201d. Rouqui\u00e9 showed me his livre de police, a record book he is legally obliged to keep, detailing two batches of Terruses purchased from Amiel in October 2012 and May 2013. They were not among the 30-odd works that ended up in the museum through the Elne associations; Rouqui\u00e9 told me those sales took place off the books. But, he says, the October 2012 entry, for 16 works obtained from Amiel, corresponds to the sale signed off at Elne municipality in 2013 \u2013 the paintings that hung in the town hall. Rouqui\u00e9 steadfastly denies that he and Lesage knowingly acquired fakes from Amiel. If Amiel was the source of many of the paintings offered to the two associations, where did he get them? What was the origin of the other works that found their way into the museum collection, some as far back as 15 years ago? What of the 1,000 fakes believed to be in private hands? Forcada\u2019s hunch is that the Roussillon forgery network is split into two parts: one targeting the museums and bourgeois clients, another the more informal street markets and regional auction houses. Several antiques dealers I speak to claim that organised criminal networks often play a role in introducing China-produced fakes, which turn up at salons, flea markets and auction houses across France. Throughout my research, one name keeps cropping up: that of a local trader. Rouqui\u00e9\u2019s record book confirms that this mystery man is a supplier, one of the wheeler-dealers he mentioned in our first interview. A former police officer reveals that the man has sold forgeries to auction houses in Pyren\u00e9es-Orientales, possibly with their collusion. Auction houses pay by cheque, so the sales are documented but confidential. Later, Rouqui\u00e9 talks me through the suppliers of most of the paintings offered to Elne\u2019s two associations, and of other alleged fakes. There are striking correspondences: the majority of the supposed acquisitions from the local wheeler-dealer either closely resemble authentic Terruses, or seem to have been copied from old postcards in the museum\u2019s 2002 catalogue. Could they be the work of a dedicated forger, as opposed to a hotchpotch by other artists later re-signed Terrus? Forcada believes there may be several forgers working under a kingpin, someone \u201celusive, remote and mysterious\u201d, as he puts it. But even if the local wheeler dealer is the mastermind, the ex-cop warns me against pursuing him: \u201cIt could finish badly for you. He\u2019s got nothing to lose.\u201d *** January 2019. People turn up at the Mus\u00e9e Terrus asking to see the fakes, but the police still have them. Visitor numbers are down. No one has been charged. The magistrate who led the investigation for six months has gone on sabbatical and been replaced by someone else, who has since left for unexplained reasons, leaving no one in charge. Rouqui\u00e9 receives me again in his office, recovering from a stomach operation made necessary by the pressure, he says. He still insists that most of the seized works are genuine. I don\u2019t know if he is lying, telling the truth or a cloudy cocktail of the two \u2013 that he convinced himself the paintings were by Terrus and let Traby take the responsibility. Meanwhile, Amiel refuses all requests for follow-up interviews and has put his house up for sale. Forcada is impatient but resolute. Some people believe the historian\u2019s Catalan allegiances have led him to hold Terrus in too high regard, and to overestimate the number of fakes in circulation. It is clear a lot of the alleged forgeries are leaden and pedantic; but in Paris a collector shows me a genuine Terrus, a watercolour that is nearly as uninspired. The artist did have his off-days. Forcada is calling for a clean-up of the market led by state museums \u2013 for example, by offering their expertise to private collectors. He believes the market could face an even greater crisis in a few decades\u2019 time when the current generation of collectors dies and their fakes go up for sale. Ultimately, he wants to encourage a change of philosophy among collectors. \u201cWe have to get everyone on the same page, so we\u2019re not drawn necessarily to fetishising a single work for its value, but to understanding the overall worth of an artist\u2019s life.\u201d One person would have agreed. Once her work upholding Terrus was done, Traby organised her death with the same singlemindedness. She finally agreed to go into a palliative clinic \u2013 because of the pain, but also to give a prying neighbour the slip. She died on 4 August 2016, a year before Forcada blew things open. Only 10 people went to her funeral. Her niece and nephew, Delay and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, had been sworn to secrecy, even from other family members: their aunt didn\u2019t want Elne\u2019s professional mourners there, \u201ccrying crocodile tears\u201d. There were no speeches; just a friend, with whom Traby had founded her music festival, playing the flute. \u201cShe was the master of ceremonies until her final moments,\u201d says Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric. \u201cThere are very few people like that: \u2018It\u2019s my life from A to Z and it\u2019s me who decides.\u2019\u201d She bequeathed 13 Terruses to the museum, authenticated by Rouqui\u00e9, which are now in the possession of the police. In her will, Traby asked for a room in Mus\u00e9e Terrus to take her name. She may not be remembered for the reasons she wanted, but hanging there are 19 paintings that speak for her undying love of art and truth. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>After Detroit\u2019s Chauncey Billups-inspired demolition of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2004 finals, perhaps the NBA\u2019s greatest post-season upset of the early 2000s came in the first round of the 2007 Western Conference playoffs. The Dallas Mavericks, owned by billionaire Mark Cuban and led by MVP-in-waiting Dirk Nowitzki, had come off a record-breaking regular season in which they\u2019d won 67 games and lost just 15. The Golden State Warriors had not made the playoffs since 1994; their squad included a number of oddballs and castoffs from other teams such as small forward Stephen Jackson, who was traded by the Indiana Pacers after he fired a gun outside a strip club in Indianapolis.

Stevens, a venture capitalist worth $2.4 billion, bought a minority stake in the Warriors in 2013, a sign of the direction in which co-executive chairmen Joe Lacob and Peter Guber intended to take the franchise: toward an ever-deepening alliance with the Silicon Valley universe of tech moguls and VCs in which they themselves made their fortune. \u201cMark will prove to be a tremendous asset to our organization,\u201d Guber <a href=\"https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/mark-stevens-joins-ownership-group\">said</a> at the time that Stevens joined the Warriors ownership group. \u201cWe\u2019ve managed to build a strong and well-rounded ownership group in which each individual contributes to our success, and Mark is no exception. He\u2019s an ideal fit.\u201d</p> \n<p>In fact Stevens proved to be such an ideal fit, so comfortable in his entitlement to the benefits of ownership, that he felt he could physically assault an opposing player. Punishment, when it came, was swift \u2013 Stevens was ejected from Oracle Arena, then handed a $500,000 fine and banned from attending NBA games until the end of next season. But the crassness of the gesture seemed to capture something else about these Warriors, a curdled, brattish quality that reflected the completion of a decade-long journey. From the battlers of 2007, a team that everyone loved, the Warriors have become a franchise that neutrals love to hate. Once underdogs, the Warriors are now the team of techbros and douchebags, too slick and too confident for their own good \u2013 a metamorphosis capped by the <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/6/5/18650905/golden-state-warriors-move-oakland-to-san-francisco\">imminent move</a> from Oakland\u2019s cramped and shopworn Oracle Arena to the shimmering disc of Chase Center in downtown San Francisco. How did they get from there to here?</p> \n<p>The simple answer, of course, is success. The Warriors have won three of the last five championships, falling only to the Cleveland Cavaliers of LeBron James and Kyrie Irving in 2016 and now to Toronto. But teams that dominate their era are not always bound to be disliked, as the Lakers and Chicago Bulls proved in the 1980s and 1990s. And when these \u201cnew\u201d Warriors \u2013 the pre-Kevin Durant team of Steph Curry, Klay Thompson, Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala \u2013 won their first championship in 2015, they were seen as a breath of fresh air, mixing lightning-quick ball movement with lethal three-point shooting. That bouncy, boyish quality \u2013 the Splash brothers raining down buckets from improbable spaces and distances, Green and Iguodala muscling up in the lane, Curry at the free-throw line, chomping at his mouthguard \u2013 has never really left the team in the four years since that breakthrough triumph. With the possible exception of Green, the team\u2019s main players are not actively unlikable; they don\u2019t go out of their way to antagonize their opponents or the fans of opposing teams. Coach Steve Kerr remains a charming, affable presence with an easy, liberal-pleasing line in anti-Trump political commentary. The team does not practice \u201cthe dark arts\u201d or revel in its status as the villain the way that other hated sporting dynasties \u2013 for instance, the New England Patriots \u2013 do.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"25a8f1fe-8140-4b48-92b7-2b0f446d0eab\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ASu2G4LUMiw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>And yet, something has shifted. There\u2019s a complacency about the team now that did not exist previously, as well as a hint of bitterness \u2013 the bitterness that comes with realizing you are not universally adored. The Warriors still want to be loved. They want to be the newcomers, the radicals shaking up the sport. Plainly, the realization that they\u2019re no longer the darling of anyone save their own supporter base bites hard. Ahead of Game 4, Green was asked how the team would cope in the absence of the injured Durant. His answer was revealing. \u201cEverybody wants to see us lose,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure people are happy they\u2019re hurt. We just got to continue to battle and win the next game, go back to Toronto, win Game 5, come back to Oracle, win Game 6 and then celebrate. Fun times ahead.\u201d The answer began with a sulk and ended with a smirk. That mix of peevishness and arrogance, unsurprisingly, did not win Green many friends online. Meanwhile Toronto\u2019s Kawhi Leonard was busy using these finals as a clinic in stoicism; for all his miraculous achievements on the court, the man didn\u2019t so much as smile until the buzzer sounded at the end of Game 6. That contrast \u2013 between the brilliantly undemonstrative Leonard and the born-to-rule smugness of the Warriors \u2013 said a lot.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/14/toronto-raptors-nba-championship-finals-golden-state-warriors\">In the era of player power, the Raptors' NBA dynasty may be over before it begins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But trash-talking and self-promotion are some of the NBA\u2019s proudest traditions, of course, so this can\u2019t explain everything. Handily there are plenty of other reasons to dislike these Warriors. Hate them for the way they turned around after relinquishing their championship in 2016 and supercharged an already exceptional team with the acquisition of Kevin Durant, the equivalent of tilting the NBA-wide playing field on a 45 degree angle and making every other team play running uphill. Hate them for their obsession with perimeter shooting and efficiency over the razzamatazz and artistry of play inside the three-point line. Hate them for their pathological need to dominate games from distance rather than engage in hand-to-hand combat under the rim. Hate them because they\u2019re a team that triumphs by disengaging from play rather than getting stuck in; for the relentless, robotic accuracy of Curry and Thompson, those menaces of the half-court; because they never take you by surprise, because they\u2019re just not fun. Hate them, in short, for the part that\u2019s lost to virtuosity and spontaneity when teams play a game of percentages rather than individual expressions.</p> \n<p>Perhaps what rankles the neutral most, though, is the way all of this \u2013 the whole data- and analytics-driven shebang of the Warriors\u2019 three-point-heavy playing style \u2013 has been allied to a deepening engagement between the franchise and Silicon Valley. The last two teams to dominate the NBA as the Warriors have were also \u201csystem\u201d teams: the Bulls of the 1990s and the Lakers of the early 2000s triumphed on the back of Phil Jackson\u2019s fabled triangle offense. These Warriors represent the first time since the 1990s that basketball has taken an epigenetic leap into a truly new way of playing the game. Unlike those earlier revolutionaries, however, the Warriors have also become the plaything of Silicon Valley at a time of mounting hostility toward Big Tech, when many of the very companies that have made Golden State\u2019s owners rich are themselves objects of legitimate public outrage. However much Phil Jackson\u2019s teams were about analytics, process and data, they weren\u2019t hitched to the cause of a tech elite that sees itself as a world apart. If today\u2019s Warriors mirror the ascendancy of tech, the \u201cShowtime\u201d Lakers of the 1980s captured the rise of America\u2019s non-stop entertainment industry.

      "bodyText": "After Detroit\u2019s Chauncey Billups-inspired demolition of the Los Angeles Lakers in the 2004 finals, perhaps the NBA\u2019s greatest post-season upset of the early 2000s came in the first round of the 2007 Western Conference playoffs. The Dallas Mavericks, owned by billionaire Mark Cuban and led by MVP-in-waiting Dirk Nowitzki, had come off a record-breaking regular season in which they\u2019d won 67 games and lost just 15. The Golden State Warriors had not made the playoffs since 1994; their squad included a number of oddballs and castoffs from other teams such as small forward Stephen Jackson, who was traded by the Indiana Pacers after he fired a gun outside a strip club in Indianapolis. Not surprisingly, the Warriors were heavy underdogs. When eventually they polished off the Mavericks 111-86 at Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena to seal the series 4-2, the house erupted. \u201cAfter the game, fans did everything but storm the floor,\u201d wrote the New York Times. Warriors players crowdsurfed across the celebrating horde, carried aloft by their long-suffering supporters. Snoop Dogg danced. The country applauded.

      "bodyText": "I recently attempted to explain to my friend Lucy just how lovely dianthus can be, but her response was to remove them from her online shopping basket and go back to looking at alliums. I pleaded: \u201cThey smell heavenly. You will be picking them all summer long, little posies of ruffled blossoms all over your kitchen.\u201d But that failed to move her. I should have qualified the difference between a carnation \u2013 the unscented, unloved flower of forecourts, top heavy and not great for the garden (and a species of dianthus) \u2013 and a pink, which is a darling, compact, scented variety that is easy to grow. (The name comes not from the colour, but the frilly edges, as in pinking shears.) Get the basics right with pinks and they will flower non-stop from July to September, not minding a dry summer, which makes them perfect for pots. The Alpine sort will hunker down on windy balconies and window ledges. Pinks do require good amounts of light: they won\u2019t grow in shade and they won\u2019t tolerate wet roots. If you garden on clay, add lots of grit and then add some more, then a little more on top of that. To keep them flowering, deadhead regularly. Pinch out the whole flowering stem so that the plant bushes out from the base. This will keep it neat. If the weather is dry, or the plants are pot-grown, water as necessary and feed them every two weeks with comfrey or phosphate-rich organic tomato feed to promote flowering. By the end of the September, they will need to be trimmed into a compact mound; this will keep them tidy over winter. All pinks are descended from Dianthus plumarius, which is sweetly scented with fringed petals that range from pink to almost white. It grows up to 20cm tall and 60cm wide. Dianthus superbus has stronger, spicier perfume and wispy pink flowers. Dianthus superbus var. longicalycinus \u2018Alba\u2019 is perfection: spidery white, sweetly scented flowers on mounds of narrow foliage, happy in sun or part shade, as long as the drainage is good. Dianthus alpinus is a mat-forming Alpine that grows to 10cm high and is perfect for windswept window boxes. There are thousands of cultivars, but I have a soft spot for \u2018Pheasant Eye\u2019 from 1690, with a deep-red centre, fringed white petals and red tips; \u2018Gran\u2019s Favourite\u2019, which is a semi-white double with astounding scent; and \u2018Dad\u2019s Favourite\u2019, which is said to have been bred by the weavers of Paisley in Scotland in the mid-19th century and has white petals, each edged in a broad, red line \u2013 good for cutting for the vase.",

A large number of their 40-plus species hail from the subtropical Macaronesian archipelagos, occupying the dusty volcanic slopes of the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. These scattered isles are home to spectacular echium forms: flower-clustered shrubs and giant pillars bursting with colour, many unique to single islands, such as Tenerife\u2019s <em>E</em><em> wildpretii</em>, appropriately named the \u201cTower of Jewels\u201d for its beguiling 3m (10ft) blooms. During the great plant-hunting era of the late 18th century, the Scottish botanist Francis Masson visited Macaronesia, writing enthusiastically back to Kew Gardens of \u201ctremendous ravines\u201d abounding with rare plants.

Almost all species, however, are united by a few defining attributes: showy compound flowers of white, pink, red or blue; narrow, hirsute leaves; and tough, wandering stems. Horticulturally, their needs are simple \u2013 a poor substrate, a sunny spot and a dose of neglect. For gardeners on chalky or sandy soil, therefore, we\u2019re talking drought-tolerant plants that produce long-lasting blooms that thrive when all but ignored.

Indeed, so protection is necessary during the cold season. Echiums can handle temperatures down to -5C, but will not tolerate damp. To avoid rot, which can be deadly, protect vulnerable plants from frost with a light fleece, removing when the sun shines to maintain airflow. Alternatively, they may be transplanted to a pot (bucket-sized will do) and brought indoors for winter. Even bulky tree echiums will lift with surprising ease and, provided the ordeal is kept brief, recover well when replanted the following spring.</p> <p>This sensitivity to cold has precipitated a misconception that echiums may only be grown on the Cornish coast or within the shielded microclimates of central London. Not so: I know of echiums growing happily in western Scotland and north Wales; from Nottingham to Northumberland. In fact, the <a href=\"http://www.echiumworld.co.uk/\" title=\"\">UK\u2019s National Echium Collection</a> (echiumworld.co.uk) resides not in the sunny south but the east Midlands, outside Newark-on-Trent. \u201cThey are wonderful plants and easier to grow than people think,\u201d says Linda Heywood, the collection\u2019s founder. \u201cThey don\u2019t need feeding or staking, and self-seed prolifically.\u201d She sows seeds on to multipurpose compost indoors throughout spring and early summer, before covering with vermiculite. \u201cAll echiums must be handled with gloves,\u201d she says, \u201cas the coarse hairs can cause skin irritation.

What\u2019s more likely is that they\u2019ll finish second or third, and still progress to the knockout stage of the tournament. </p> <p>The permutations are mind-bendingly complex, as you can imagine. Anyway, I\u2019ve had a crack at working it all out, and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with:</p> <p>To note: top two automatically qualify for the knockout stage; best four third-placed teams also qualify.</p> <p>Worst-case scenario: defeat to Jamaica. But even that wouldn\u2019t spell the end for the Matildas and they could still finish third, unless they get absolutely hammered and there was an eight-goal swing in goal difference. Unlikely, very unlikely, but worth pointing out. And a third-placed finish with just three points might not place them among the best of the rest though.</p> <p>A draw with Jamaica: this would ensure at least third place with four points, and might even be enough to secure second, if Italy beat Brazil in the other game. Then they\u2019d sweat on results in other groups to see if they were among the best of the third-placed teams.</p> <p>A win over Jamaica (the most likely scenario): now things get interesting. A big win could see the Matildas top the group, depending on the other result. To do so they would have to improve their goal difference (currently 0) to better than Italy\u2019s (+6) or Brazil\u2019s (+2) and hope Brazil beat Italy, a result that would leave all three teams on six points. If the Matildas and Italy both win, or if it\u2019s a draw in the other game, Australia would finish second.</p> <p>My head hurts. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/14/jamaica-italy-womens-world-cup-group-c-match-report\">Italy on verge of last 16 as Cristiana Girelli hat-trick crushes Jamaica</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-15T06:14:02.092Z\">at 7.14am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d0486f28f08532f138d2127\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-15T05:51:12.488Z\">6.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>NRL: HT: Melbourne 12-0 Newcastle</strong> \u2013 Halftime at AAMI Park and Melbourne are handling Newcastle without much fuss.

      "bodyText": "Cricket World Cup: We\u2019re about five minutes away from the start of play at the Oval, where Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bowl first. Jonathan Howcroft is at the controls of the liveblog, so why not join him for the rest of the evening? This blog will be closing off now, thanks for joining me. Until next time. State of Origin: The teams for Game 2 are announced tomorrow; Panthers James Maloney and Nathan Cleary will be hopeful of having their names on the Brad Fittler\u2019s Blues teamsheet after their performances against Souths. The Panthers come from behind to stun Souths! Four on the bounce for them now! And after winning 10 of their opening 11 games this season, the Rabbitohs have now lost their last three \u2013 the first time they have done so since rounds 22-24 last year. A thriller at Homebush. Penrith are resurgent! And James Maloney will be able celebrate tonight. Maloney celebrated his 33rd birthday by sinking a clutch 75th-minute field goal in the Panthers\u2019 win. Importantly, he has scored a head-to-head victory over South Sydney counterpart Cody Walker, who is struggling to hold onto his Blues No 6 jumper for next Sunday\u2019s Origin II in Perth. Walker missed a field-goal attempt in the 74th minute as his side continued their Origin period slump with a third loss on the trot. It has been reported that Panthers No 7 Nathan Cleary is set to partner Mitchell Pearce in the Blues halves next Sunday at Optus Stadium, however Maloney has given Blues coach Brad Fittler and his selectors food for thought. (AAP) There goes the siren at Optus Stadium and the final margin is 21, after a dominant final quarter, in which the Dockers kept the Power goalless. Three straight wins for Freo now. They looked very good in that final period. Michael Walters produced another match-winning display having booted the winning score in each of the Dockers\u2019 past two games. And the 28-year-old produced the goods yet again, booting six goals from 25 disposals in the 15.10 (100) to 12.7 (79) win in front of 37,451 fans. Fremantle trailed by a point heading into the final term. Walters nailed a tough 40m set shot midway through the last quarter to get the ball rolling, and he iced the game with a goal in the dying minutes. (AAP) NRL: 5 minutes remaining: Rabbitohs 18-19 Panthers \u2013 Maloney goes for a field goal and nails it to give Penrith the lead with five minutes to go, after Brian To\u2019o levelled the scores with a 71st-minute try. What have Souths got now? Cricket: A nice story just off the wires: the local net bowler who was struck in the head by a David Warner straight drive has returned to meet with the Australian World Cup team. Jay Plaha spent four nights in a London hospital after being hit last Saturday at The Oval. The 22-year-old required urgent medical attention from Australia\u2019s medical staff before scans later cleared him of any serious injury. (AAP) AFL: 9 minutes remaining: Fremantle 13.9 (87) v Port Adelaide 12.7 (79) \u2013 Both sides find it difficult to kick a goal in this final term as the pressure mounts. Michael Walters breaks the deadlock though with a precision left footer from a narrow angle for his fifth of the day. NRL: 21 minutes remaining: Rabbitohs 18-14 Panthers \u2013 It takes just two minutes for the Rabbitohs to score two tries \u2013 first Liam Knight barging over and then James Roberts streaking away to hand off to Dane Gagai \u2013 and Souths take the lead at a sodden ANZ after an almighty downpour. Rabbits on top. AFL: 3QT: Fremantle 12.6 (78) v Port Adelaide 12.7 (79) \u2013 One point in it with one quarter to play in Perth. Port will head into the fourth with their noses in front, just, after a sterling third period. Kane Farrell has a career-high four goals \u2013 his fourth gave the lead back to the Power, his third one of the more straight-forward he\u2019ll ever kick. Women\u2019s World Cup: Did I mention earlier that the US celebrations against Thailand had sparked no small amount of debate? Here\u2019s more on the Great Goal Celebration Controversy of 2019 from Caitlin Murray in Paris. NRL: HT: Rabbitohs 6-8 Panthers \u2013 It\u2019s a low scoring affair at ANZ, just a try apiece so far. Red-hot Viliame Kikau levellled for the Panthers after Cameron Murray opened the scoring for Souths. Evenly poised at Homebush, but the Rabbits will have to come from behind to end their losing run \u2013 and the Panthers\u2019 winning streak of three, including last week\u2019s win over the Roosters. Supercars: Scott McLaughlin\u2019s rich vein of form has continued with the DJR Team Penske driver winning race one of the Darwin Triple Crown from pole position. More from AAP: McLaughlin is looking to become the first driver to complete Darwin\u2019s elusive Triple Crown since its inception in 2006, and is a third of the way there. To etch his name into the history books the DJR Team Penske speedster needs to win on Sunday\u2019s top-10 shootout and race two in the Top End. The safety car was required after just three laps on Saturday when Tim Slade\u2019s race ended after a bump from Rick Kelly at the hairpin. A slow pit stop on lap 15 cost Anton de Pasquale any chance of a podium and he finished 12th after starting fourth on the grid. Chaz Mostert was the biggest winner during the stops as he managed to jump four spots and finish second behind McLaughlin. Will Davison and Dave Reynolds clashed in the pit lanes but the latter still rounded out the podium, while the former finish ninth after starting third on the grid. Jamie Whincup and Shane van Gisbergen pitted late and made up ground to finish fifth and eighth respectively, while Cameron Waters was fourth. Football: The Socceroos are heading to Argentina and Colombia to face some of the best sides in the world at next year\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica. Strange? Yes. A great opportunity? Yes. A real chance to lift another continental trophy? Um, not really. Anyway, do you know who visited? Who hasn\u2019t won it? Who used a fake penis? Test yourself below: AFL: I missed this earlier, but it\u2019s worth revisiting as it\u2019s beautiful. Much like the Sydney Stack-Eddie Betts \u201cincident\u201d the other night, aren\u2019t moments like these what sport is all about? AFL: HT: Fremantle 8.4 (52) v Port Adelaide 7.5 (47) \u2013 The Fyfe-Boak matchup isn\u2019t disappointing so far. Fyfe\u2019s had 18 disposals to Boak\u2019s 17 in what has been an evenly-contested opening half at Optus Stadium. Women\u2019s World Cup: And while we\u2019re on the topic, just do yourself a favour and read this absolute gold from Marina Hyde. The best thing written all week: Women\u2019s World Cup: Aside from Sam Kerr\u2019s comments, the biggest talking point from the last few days in France has been the US celebrations during their 13-0 win over Thailand. Over the top or fully justified? Disrespectful or \u201cTHIS IS THE WORLD CUP!\u201d It\u2019s sparked a thousand opinion pieces, including two from our very own Hope Solo and Eni Aluko. Cricket World Cup: Some absolutely bonkers figures in this report ahead of India and Pakistan\u2019s game at Old Trafford in Manchester tomorrow: 800,000 fans applied for the 26,000-capacity match. 800,000. Few sporting contests carry as much baggage \u2013 or interest. Organisers are hoping that close to a billion people will be watching, with a Cricket World Cup source telling the Guardian that it will have \u201cthe biggest reach of any cricket match in history when you take into account people viewing it on digital\u201d. NRL: Rabbitohs v Panthers \u2013 And we\u2019re off at ANZ Stadium. Souths are missing several players, not least Sam and Tom Burgess, and have lost their last two, but Alex Johnston returns. Dylan Walker gets a chance to lock in his Origin jumper, given Mitchell Pearce\u2019s earlier performance. \u201cWe\u2019ll have our hands full,\u201d says coach Wayne Bennett before kick-off, but the Bunnies will still be expected to emerge victorious from this one. Since 2012, they\u2019ve won eight of 11 against the Panthers, with all three Penrith wins coming at Panthers Stadium. Cricket World Cup: Australia are up against Sri Lanka in about two hours at the Oval in London and the good news is that it\u2019s not forecast to rain \u2013 at least not all day long, so we should see some cricket at some stage. The always excellent Barney Ronay has written on the English weather, and its relationship with cricket: And naturally rain is there in English cricket, which is essentially an exercise in defiance of rain, a rebuke to the shadow of rain. To play cricket is to think and know and care about rain, to have opinions and theories on rain, to stand around saying: \u2018It\u2019s coming from over there. This is high cloud. The sky is definitely lighter that side. This, I can feel in the hairs of my forearms, in the tendons of my knee, is going to pass.\u2019 Read the whole thing here: And then have a read of Adam Collins, who will be liveblogging the Australia match later, and his take on the UK summer of rain: NRL: Some news out of the Super League, with the captain of Leeds Rhinos, Kallum Watkins, set to move to the Gold Coast, a decent signing for the Titans. And all over on the Sunshine Coast too, as the Lightning coast to a dominant win over the Pies. Karla Pretorius was immense in defence for the Lightning with five intercepts, four gains. \u201cWonderful game,\u201d the South African tells Channel Nine. \u201cEspecially from the previous two games we needed to step up as a team. Put our consistent performance out there. We did well. Even the ones that came up from the bench they came on and it went smoothly. Happy with the whole team as performance.\u201d Wow, an absolute tonking delivered by the Storm. What a second half. The Knights were simply blown away as Melbourne register their fifth win on the trot. They\u2019ll end the weekend on top of the shop, regardless of how the Rabbitohs do against the Panthers, coming right up. And so ends Newcastle\u2019s six-game winning streak. All that defending in the first half came back to haunt them in the second, and the Storm rolled over them without having to push themselves too hard. Got to wonder what this will do for Mitchell Pearce\u2019s Origin claims. The Knights half was nowhere near the worst on the park, but when they were under the pump in the first half he wasn\u2019t able to direct them out of trouble either. And here\u2019s some more details on that earlier Pocock story. AFL: Fremantle v Port Adelaide \u2013 Here we go at Optus Stadium in Perth, where a new statue of Nicky Winmar will be erected. Des Headland, the chair of the Indigenous Player Alliance that advocates on behalf of the Indigenous men and women who have played in the AFL and AFLW, wrote beautifully on the statue and what it means earlier in the week: They\u2019ve done it! The Saints\u2019 comeback \u2013 from as much as 31 points down \u2013 is complete, despite a frantic final few seconds in Townsville in which the Saints held on to win by the narrow margin of four points. For the Suns, they just can\u2019t seem to get out of their rut; that\u2019s nine losses on the bounce for them now. Rugby union: Finally, some good news for Australian rugby! It\u2019s not been the best of years so far, a World Cup year no less, either on or off the field, but it seems like David Pocock, who last month announced his retirement from Super Rugby, may be making a return to the field a little earlier than expected. That may mean he\u2019ll be available to Michael Cheika for the Rugby Championship, which this year acts as a precursor to the main event in Japan. Cheika is due to meet Pocock today and said: \u201cI think David is going to be in good shape when it comes to even the earlier series, not just the World Cup but the Rugby Championship that is coming beforehand.\u201d Huzzah. Super Netball: HT: Lightning 31-25 Magpies \u2013 Lightning goal shooter Peace Proscovia may have the best name in the comp, but the Ugandan has also got the tools \u2013 she\u2019s 25 from 28 attempts this afternoon (at 89%) and the most influential player on the court so far. Magpie Shimona Nelson has 20/24 at 83% but it\u2019s the home side who have claimed a second bonus point and lead by six at the big break. Women\u2019s World Cup: That thrilling win over Brazil \u2013 which was quickly afforded the moniker \u201cThe Miracle of Montpellier\u201d \u2013 revived the Matildas\u2019 campaign and, coupled with Italy\u2019s overnight smashing of whipping girls Jamaica, has set up a compelling final round of the group stage in which pretty much any scenario can play out; Ante Milicic\u2019s side can still top the group, but they could also, technically, finish bottom. What\u2019s more likely is that they\u2019ll finish second or third, and still progress to the knockout stage of the tournament. The permutations are mind-bendingly complex, as you can imagine. Anyway, I\u2019ve had a crack at working it all out, and here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come up with: To note: top two automatically qualify for the knockout stage; best four third-placed teams also qualify. Worst-case scenario: defeat to Jamaica. But even that wouldn\u2019t spell the end for the Matildas and they could still finish third, unless they get absolutely hammered and there was an eight-goal swing in goal difference. Unlikely, very unlikely, but worth pointing out. And a third-placed finish with just three points might not place them among the best of the rest though. A draw with Jamaica: this would ensure at least third place with four points, and might even be enough to secure second, if Italy beat Brazil in the other game. Then they\u2019d sweat on results in other groups to see if they were among the best of the third-placed teams. A win over Jamaica (the most likely scenario): now things get interesting. A big win could see the Matildas top the group, depending on the other result. To do so they would have to improve their goal difference (currently 0) to better than Italy\u2019s (+6) or Brazil\u2019s (+2) and hope Brazil beat Italy, a result that would leave all three teams on six points. If the Matildas and Italy both win, or if it\u2019s a draw in the other game, Australia would finish second. My head hurts. NRL: HT: Melbourne 12-0 Newcastle \u2013 Halftime at AAMI Park and Melbourne are handling Newcastle without much fuss. The Knights have been in fine form recently but they\u2019re getting worked over by the Storm in the ruck and it\u2019s showing. Too many errors \u2013 55% completion rate \u2013 and the attack is all over the place. Melbourne haven\u2019t totally clicked either, but if they do and Newcastle are forced to make that many tackles again in the second half they could find themselves on the wrong end of a big score. Anyone else get Richard Swain flashbacks watching Jahrome Hughes in the headgear? AFL: 3QT: Gold Coast 8.9 (57) v St Kilda (50) \u2013 The Saints are on the march as the siren sounds in Townsville and have managed to cut the Suns\u2019 half-time lead of 19 down to seven. They\u2019ve got the wind in their sails heading into the final quarter and are poised to stage a tremendous comeback. Golf: At the US Open, Adam Scott is flying the Australian flag after two rounds, with Gary Woodland out in the lead. Scott is six shots behind the pace-setting American at three-under after shooting two under-par opening rounds for the first time at this event. Compatriots Marc Leishman (74), Jason Day (73) and Cameron Smith (72) all finished at one-over. Ewan Murray is at Pebble Beach: Women\u2019s World Cup: There\u2019s been plenty of talk about the Matildas post-Brazil game but sadly, not all of it has been focused on the football with much hot internet air expelled over Sam Kerr\u2019s full-time interview, in which she told critics to \u201csuck on that one\u201d. It\u2019s also shone a light on the amount of abuse these players receive, day in, day out, on social media. As Richard Parkin writes in his latest dispatch from Montpellier: Commentators from back home concluded that Kerr must be mistaken \u2013 because all of Australia was behind the Matildas. An entirely acceptable claim if you\u2019re oblivious to the homophobic or sexist abuse hurled daily at female players \u2013 something that\u2019s exacerbated by an environment in which a months-old controversy is given greater prominence throughout the first week of the tournament than the voices or the actions of the Matildas themselves. Read the whole yarn here: NRL: Bad news for Maroons fans with just a week to go before Origin Game 3 in Perth \u2013 Jai Arrow is not playing for Newcastle today and will miss Queensland\u2019s trip out West for next Sunday\u2019s big game with an ankle injury. Super Netball: Lightning v Magpies \u2013 and we\u2019re nearly underway at USC Stadium on the Sunshine Coast, where the Lightning are looking to open up some daylight between them and the West Coast Fever, who don\u2019t play until tomorrow. The pair are level on 35 points heading into this round, the penultimate one before the much-talked about mid-season break for the World Cup in Liverpool. The Magpies, meanwhile, are just outside the top four, two points off the Giants and well within swooping distance. NRL: Melbourne v Newcastle \u2013 All eyes are on Kalyn Ponga at a chilly AAMI Park today, after some midweek speculation he\u2019s been the subject of an approach from Wallabies coach Michael Cheika to make a switch to union. More on that later. Smoke from pre-match fireworks has cleared and they\u2019re off in Melbourne. AFL: HT: Gold Coast 5.6 (36) v 2.5 (17) St Kilda \u2013 To that game that\u2019s already underway at Riverway Stadium, and the sun is shining in Townsville where the Suns are, um, shining as they bid to put a stop to an eight-game losing streak. They end the half with a 19-point lead before heading into the sheds for a slice of orange, or whatever their poison is. Hello and welcome. Another busy day of sport is already underway across the country; I\u2019ll do my best to keep you updated throughout, starting with the AFL clash between Gold Coast and St Kilda (more on that in a tick), and the big one in the NRL between table-toppers Storm and fifth-placed Newcastle. The Lightning play the Magpies in Super Netball, also getting underway at 3pm AEST, before the stuttering Rabbitohs face the Panthers and Fremantle play Port Adelaide to round off the afternoon\u2019s action. Plenty going on in the evening too, not least at the Oval in south London, where Australia\u2019s cricketers attempt to take top spot with victory over Sri Lanka. We\u2019ll have a separate liveblog to cover that one off late on. Lots to get through, so let\u2019s not dilly-dally any further. Do get in touch if you feel you need to get something off your chest. The email\u2019s mike.hytner@theguardian.com and the twitter is @mike_hytner. Let\u2019s do this!",

Her team are worried that her black hoodie, featuring the colourful logo of a young, disruptive sportswear brand, won\u2019t fit with the podcast she is recording about girls\u2019 mental health when the pictures go up on Instagram.</p> <p>Aboah\u2019s not having it. \u201cNah \u2013 these are my boys,\u201d she says, of the designers behind the hoodie. \u201cAnyway, would you prefer the one I have on underneath?\u201d She lifts her top to reveal a white T-shirt that says: \u201cBlowjobs are real jobs.\u201d</p> <p>There is a story behind the T-shirt, of course. It was designed by a friend of hers who is a sex worker and a lesbian, but is proud of her work with male clients. The friend sometimes stays at Aboah\u2019s parents\u2019 house, freaking out Aboah\u2019s dad with stories of douching her vagina. Soon enough, Aboah\u2019s team have changed their minds. \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s keep the black hoodie on,\u201d says one. \u201cIt works fine.\u201d</p> <p>At 26, Aboah is one of the most photographed women in the world. She has graced the cover of US, Spanish, German, Italian, Mexican and British Vogues, as well as W, i-D and Time magazine. She regularly adorns 100ft canvases in airports, or the sides of buses or shop fronts. She has her own line of jewellery and her own Barbie, with a brown complexion and a shaved head. Today, there is a heart barbered into her cropped hair, one of her many adornments, along with delicate hand-scrawled tattoos, signet rings, neck chains, bracelets and her signature tooth gem.</p> <p>These days, Aboah describes herself as an activist first and a model second. It is hard not to be a little sceptical: what self-respecting celebrity these days is complete without a pet cause, a United Nations appointment or a wellbeing-oriented Instagram account? It is admirable when people use their fame to do good, of course; it is just hard to tell, sometimes, where the PR ends and the conviction begins.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0967fb1f76100b342174295e6aabbbd361db6bab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0967fb1f76100b342174295e6aabbbd361db6bab/0_1309_3822_2273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah speaking at a Gurls Talk event in Warsaw\" width=\"1000\" height=\"595\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I had no idea we had this community there\u2019: speaking at a Gurls Talk event in Warsaw.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Victoria Kocha\u0144ska/Vogue Poland</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The more time I spend with Aboah \u2013 several hours, over two days \u2013 the harder that scepticism is to sustain. She puts a tremendous amount of effort into her mental health charity, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/dec/07/fierce-female-chat-from-adwoa-aboah-and-friends-podcasts-of-the-week\" title=\"\">Gurls Talk</a>, which she founded in 2015 as an Instagram account, growing it into a weekly podcast and a series of global events that have brought girls and women together in cities from London and Los Angeles to Accra and Warsaw. When I ask her about these, she beams with pride.</p> <p>\u201cI really felt very confident when we did the Gurls Talk event in Poland,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: this is in Europe and there are going to be a lot of similarities [with British audiences]. But when we talked about abortion, religion really came into the equation, and how you were brought up. It was a big moment for Gurls Talk \u2013 girls had travelled from small towns, the panel discussions went on for hours. I had no idea we had this community there.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The trauma that surrounds you feeling like you were stupid is something that stays with you for a long time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The event Aboah seems most proud of took place last year in her father\u2019s birth country, Ghana. The format is consistent across Gurls Talk events: a panel of local women and girls engage with an audience who, in countries such as Ghana, may not be used to opening up about their experiences.</p> <p>\u201cI introduced each panel, but I made a point of handing the torch over to give all these amazing women the chance to do what they do,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cAt first, everyone was a bit shy, but then they started putting their hands up and sharing all these things \u2013 around sexual assault in school, for example, things I didn\u2019t necessarily know were such big subjects because I didn\u2019t grow up in Ghana. But I have been going there all my life. It was monumental to me.\u201d</p> <p>Aboah does not always feel so confident. A few weeks ago, she was speaking at a GQ magazine event where Piers Morgan was also on the bill, talking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/alastaircampbell\" title=\"\">Alastair Campbell </a>about political interviews. \u201cI watched him say all this stuff, and when they opened it up to the floor, all of us [Aboah and her friends] were too scared to say anything, because we didn\u2019t want to be bullied. Because he is a bully,\u201d Aboah says, referring to Morgan\u2019s reputation for shouting down guests. \u201cThere are times when I do feel quite fearful about talking about politics. You have to be knowledgable and articulate,\u201d she says. \u201cThat always scares me, as someone who has struggled academically and is highly dyslexic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b560473be0cc6b2c94016fc4deda4232aeb57e8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b560473be0cc6b2c94016fc4deda4232aeb57e8a/498_52_2644_4887/541.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah on the Richard Quinn catwalk for autumn/winter 2019, at London Fashion Week, 19 Feb 2019\" width=\"541\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Modelling for Richard Quinn at London fashion week in February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WWD/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you look online for the most publicised images of Aboah, in among the Fendi, Versace and Gap campaigns you will find photographs of her sitting in the bath, looking vacant and frail, shortly after an attempt to kill herself in 2014. \u201cI look at these photos and I see a different person staring back at me\u2026 the darkness had overtaken me, the grey had engulfed my life, I was broken, exhausted and the light has completely left my eyes,\u201d she wrote about her suicide attempt last year, in <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BoweUNeh1_0/?utm_source=ig_embed\" title=\"\">an Instagram post</a> to mark World Mental Health Day. Aboah had overdosed; she was in a coma for four days, before recovering in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cI mourn the girl I once was, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019d like to jump into the photo, kiss away the tears, hug her for ever and tell her that she\u2019s not alone.\u201d It was a heartbreaking memo to her younger self, who had a ketamine addiction and poor mental health. </p> <p>Since her recovery, she has spoken frankly about that low point and about her treatment for depression, addiction and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/bipolar-disorder\" title=\"\">bipolar disorder</a>, problems that began much earlier, she says, when she was a teenager at boarding school. \u201cI think it was obvious something was wrong, because I would miss loads of school. I just thought it was because I was really homesick,\u201d Aboah says, matter-of-factly. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel suicidal or anything like that then. I just wanted to jump out of my skin. I felt unhappy and insecure and pressured. But I don\u2019t see why things have to get to rock bottom before you\u2019re able to get help \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be like that. With Gurls Talk, I\u2019ve created a space where we get to talk about those things, where we get to bring all our shit into that room, where anything and everything is important.\u201d</p> <p>Aboah talks constantly about \u201cour girls\u201d and says her work on the podcast is about giving them an opportunity to \u201cswitch off, put your headphones on and, when you are thinking negatively, just block out the outside world. By the end of the episode, I want to give girls the tools to block out the darkness and go forward.\u201d That may sound earnest, but her podcast is a joyful affair, involving interviews with compelling and inspiring young women; a <a href=\"http://gurlstalk.libsyn.com/ep-12-adwoa-dina-asher-smith-and-tiffany-calver-talk-competitive-streaks-and-how-it-made-them-the-first-and-the-fastest-in-their-fields\" title=\"\">recent episode brought together the champion sprinter Dina Asher-Smith and the hip-hop DJ Tiffany Calver</a> to talk about their competitive natures.</p> <p>It is the kind of frank conversation, about how to navigate the world as a young woman \u2013 and a black woman \u2013 that the teenage Aboah needed. She was raised around the fashion industry: her father, Charles Aboah, is a location scout, while her white, English mother, Camilla Lowther, founded the agency CLM in 1984 and went on to represent many of the biggest photographers, stylists and film-makers in the business.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As a girl, I saw myself as not-black-enough and not-white-enough. Finding \u2018skin-colour\u2019 tights was a thing I couldn\u2019t do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Aboah describes her younger sister Kesewa \u2013 who has modelled for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/alexander-mcqueen\" title=\"\">Alexander McQueen</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/miu-miu\" title=\"\">Miu Miu</a>, and recently completed an art degree in New York \u2013 as her \u201csoulmate\u201d. But Aboah felt like the more vulnerable member of her close-knit family. \u201cKesewa has always been the more carefree one. I was always painfully shy,\u201d Aboah says. Her confidence was further knocked by dyslexia, which made school a struggle. \u201cI worked, I tried to get the grades. But an exam based on how much I\u2019d revised didn\u2019t really work with me. I would just get into those exam rooms and fail.\u201d</p> <p>That sense of failure, Aboah now realises, had long-term effects. \u201cThe trauma that surrounds you feeling like you were stupid is something that stays with you for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I got sober that I realised it didn\u2019t matter that I couldn\u2019t punctuate or spell. I could still write if I wanted to.\u201d</p> <p>Drug abuse among her peers added to young Aboah\u2019s demons. \u201cDrugs came quite early on. Too early on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into treatment that I realised that it was very odd that we started taking drugs that young.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"922721b6d307780d5822680da387bff0903fec26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/922721b6d307780d5822680da387bff0903fec26/0_150_3840_4004/959.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah photographed in London, May 2019\" width=\"959\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was always painfully shy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik Madigan Heck/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was after Aboah left school \u2013 to do a degree in drama at Brunel University London \u2013 and began working that her drug use, especially of ketamine, began to spiral. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really being that honest. And I was using that as a kind of crutch to make me feel a little bit better,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Aboah had started modelling by then \u2013 at first, fairly informal shoots through her mother\u2019s network, then more professional ones after leaving school and university. Was modelling part of the problem? \u201cMy work ethic at that time wasn\u2019t that great,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI found it quite embarrassing to feel upset about the rejections. So I didn\u2019t really ever sit in the emotions very long. And then I would watch certain girls, and their careers had gone completely differently to mine. They had been supported by British publications and I had never felt that support. I would definitely say there was envy and jealousy. At the same time, I didn\u2019t necessarily care about that side of my life that much.\u201d Her career was on the up, but, battling her demons, Aboah\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in it.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Growing up, I knew and dearly loved Aboah\u2019s grandparents, met but barely knew her parents, and heard about but never met Aboah. Like many mixed-race children in Britain, we had overlapping Ghanaian families (her father is related to my mother\u2019s family), but we straddled other worlds, too. Neither of us was firmly part of any one community. We were dispersed in different, predominantly white environments, places where our African heritage put us in a minority of one or two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"751ac0cad216341638f0dd1fdf465cbd49a588db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/751ac0cad216341638f0dd1fdf465cbd49a588db/963_156_1213_3736/325.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah Gurls Talk Barbie doll\" width=\"325\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Gurls Talk Barbie doll.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mattel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first time I met Aboah, at a party a couple of years ago, I was struck by her honesty. Whatever the subject, she doesn\u2019t dial it up or down; she approaches every topic, whether her suicide attempt or her plans for the evening, with the same degree of openness, all delivered in a deadpan, impossibly gravelly voice. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I speak,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI know the importance of sharing one\u2019s story and being really honest about it.\u201d</p> <p>By her own admission, there are some things that come to the surface more easily than others. When she started Gurls Talk, the focus was on mental health experiences. Over time, she began to see the relevance of, and include more discussions about, race and identity. \u201cGrowing up, I saw myself as not-black-enough and not-white-enough,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was only when I got to boarding school that I was like: \u2018Oh my God, this is an issue.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Her racial heritage led to a level of exclusion \u2013 \u201clike, watching all the girls in my school wearing Dream Matte Mousse foundation.\u201d The foundation was a 90s sensation, but \u2013 as I can attest \u2013 its colours were a hopeless fit for almost all black skin tones. \u201cI just didn\u2019t understand that putting on \u2018skin-colour\u2019 tights was a thing I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d</p> <p>I tell Aboah that, as a mixed-race girl in a very white school environment, I shared these experiences. I was convinced that boys were not interested in me. \u201cOh, they definitely were not interested in me,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI could just piece it together from the girls who were idolised. I was never going to look like them. So I immediately thought I was hideous.\u201d The sense of rejection went deep. \u201cI truly believe that if I\u2019d been given some sort of space to really get down to it \u2013 to talk about being a virgin, to talk about my insecurities around my hair, all these things \u2013 it would have made a big difference,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Hair is an issue for so many black women, and Aboah\u2019s experience is no exception. At the beginning of her modelling career, hair anxiety became an unwelcome part of her day. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly explain to someone the embarrassment of sitting in a chair at a modelling job and having 10 people around your head, struggling with your hair,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cOr what it\u2019s like taking your hair out of a ponytail and watching in the mirror as someone goes like this\u201d \u2013 she feigns a catastrophic facial expression. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain to someone what it\u2019s like to wear a hat for four years because you didn\u2019t want someone to touch your hair, or snogging someone, fearing that they might try and put their hands through it when you\u2019ve got your hair grease in it, or they\u2019re going to ruin it. I think only a black girl will ever, ever understand that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes I can\u2019t even be bothered to explain it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf3a89a34f432ce8559be0cdbec8083ebeaaee6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf3a89a34f432ce8559be0cdbec8083ebeaaee6d/348_175_2267_2037/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adwoa Aboah with her parents, Camilla Lowther and Charles Aboah, at a WSJ magazine reception in London in September 17\" width=\"1000\" height=\"899\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With her parents, Camilla Lowther and Charles Aboah.

What happened next shows the power of abandoning attempts to please others and, in short, not giving a damn. Because it was when Aboah shaved her head \u2013 against the advice of her agency \u2013 that her career went stratospheric. \u201cEverything feels better when I\u2019m doing me with full force,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is who I am. Rejection feels less painful because I\u2019m being myself. If they don\u2019t get it, someone else will.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>I sit down a couple of days after our interview to watch her record a Gurls Talk podcast, as she interviews <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/how-a-somaliborn-girl-became-a-referee-of-men-s-football-in-england-the-remarkable-story-of-jawahir-a3654736.html\" title=\"\">Jawahir Roble</a>, AKA JJ, the first female, Muslim qualified football referee in the UK. In a plush basement studio in London, Aboah draws out JJ\u2019s remarkable life story: how she defied the odds to play football, and then to persuade her sceptical parents that it was what she was supposed to do. Aboah, the schoolgirl who was convinced she was stupid and ugly, is a quick-witted, fluent interviewer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With activism, you don\u2019t go to bed and the job is done \u2013 you wake up and there are still the same problems</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The podcast has a clear structure: Gurls Talk, where the guest shares their story; Gurls Share, where listeners send in their experiences; Gurls Listen, where the guest shares their coping mechanism; Gurls Take Control, where Aboah and her interviewee talk about what they have learned; and Gurls Take Action, where they work out what, practically, they can do next. It sounds prescriptive, but Aboah is so good at guiding JJ through the hour they spend in the recording booth, at bringing out the humour in her story \u2013 how to explain mud on your shoes to the dad who has forbidden you from playing football \u2013 that it works.</p> <p>Later, I ask her how being part of the fashion industry fits with her work around mental health. It is a complicated question, not least for a black woman who knows the power of that industry to foster a sense of exclusion, but also as someone who was born into an affluent family established in that world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b6c6ea88930e07faeaaa7fe48bfe333a7997ece\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b6c6ea88930e07faeaaa7fe48bfe333a7997ece/0_831_3840_4728/812.jpg\" alt=\"Head shot of model Adwoa Aboah\" width=\"812\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polo neck, <a href=\"https://shrimps.com/\">shrimps.com</a>.

My black friends and I always talk about \u2018the quota\u2019,\u201d (the idea that brands only include a limited number of people of colour, creating opportunities for a privileged few). \u201cIt\u2019s definitely helped me that I fit into a certain box.\u201d </p> <p>While acknowledging her privilege in a world where \u201ccolourism\u201d remains rife, she identifies as black rather than mixed race. \u201cWe don\u2019t really <em>say</em> \u2018mixed race\u2019 any more,\u201d she says, referring to conversations with friends who have one white parent. \u201cWe always say we are black.

I will never forget going to my auntie and uncle\u2019s [in Ghana] and getting my hair braided and washing it over the bathtub, the food we would eat, the chilli, sleepovers with family.

      "bodyText": "Adwoa Aboah\u2019s clothes are causing a stir, and not \u2013 as you might expect from one of the world\u2019s most recognisable models \u2013 in a fashion sense. Her team are worried that her black hoodie, featuring the colourful logo of a young, disruptive sportswear brand, won\u2019t fit with the podcast she is recording about girls\u2019 mental health when the pictures go up on Instagram. Aboah\u2019s not having it. \u201cNah \u2013 these are my boys,\u201d she says, of the designers behind the hoodie. \u201cAnyway, would you prefer the one I have on underneath?\u201d She lifts her top to reveal a white T-shirt that says: \u201cBlowjobs are real jobs.\u201d There is a story behind the T-shirt, of course. It was designed by a friend of hers who is a sex worker and a lesbian, but is proud of her work with male clients. The friend sometimes stays at Aboah\u2019s parents\u2019 house, freaking out Aboah\u2019s dad with stories of douching her vagina. Soon enough, Aboah\u2019s team have changed their minds. \u201cYou know what, let\u2019s keep the black hoodie on,\u201d says one. \u201cIt works fine.\u201d At 26, Aboah is one of the most photographed women in the world. She has graced the cover of US, Spanish, German, Italian, Mexican and British Vogues, as well as W, i-D and Time magazine. She regularly adorns 100ft canvases in airports, or the sides of buses or shop fronts. She has her own line of jewellery and her own Barbie, with a brown complexion and a shaved head. Today, there is a heart barbered into her cropped hair, one of her many adornments, along with delicate hand-scrawled tattoos, signet rings, neck chains, bracelets and her signature tooth gem. These days, Aboah describes herself as an activist first and a model second. It is hard not to be a little sceptical: what self-respecting celebrity these days is complete without a pet cause, a United Nations appointment or a wellbeing-oriented Instagram account? It is admirable when people use their fame to do good, of course; it is just hard to tell, sometimes, where the PR ends and the conviction begins. The more time I spend with Aboah \u2013 several hours, over two days \u2013 the harder that scepticism is to sustain. She puts a tremendous amount of effort into her mental health charity, Gurls Talk, which she founded in 2015 as an Instagram account, growing it into a weekly podcast and a series of global events that have brought girls and women together in cities from London and Los Angeles to Accra and Warsaw. When I ask her about these, she beams with pride. \u201cI really felt very confident when we did the Gurls Talk event in Poland,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought: this is in Europe and there are going to be a lot of similarities [with British audiences]. But when we talked about abortion, religion really came into the equation, and how you were brought up. It was a big moment for Gurls Talk \u2013 girls had travelled from small towns, the panel discussions went on for hours. I had no idea we had this community there.\u201d The event Aboah seems most proud of took place last year in her father\u2019s birth country, Ghana. The format is consistent across Gurls Talk events: a panel of local women and girls engage with an audience who, in countries such as Ghana, may not be used to opening up about their experiences. \u201cI introduced each panel, but I made a point of handing the torch over to give all these amazing women the chance to do what they do,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cAt first, everyone was a bit shy, but then they started putting their hands up and sharing all these things \u2013 around sexual assault in school, for example, things I didn\u2019t necessarily know were such big subjects because I didn\u2019t grow up in Ghana. But I have been going there all my life. It was monumental to me.\u201d Aboah does not always feel so confident. A few weeks ago, she was speaking at a GQ magazine event where Piers Morgan was also on the bill, talking to Alastair Campbell about political interviews. \u201cI watched him say all this stuff, and when they opened it up to the floor, all of us [Aboah and her friends] were too scared to say anything, because we didn\u2019t want to be bullied. Because he is a bully,\u201d Aboah says, referring to Morgan\u2019s reputation for shouting down guests. \u201cThere are times when I do feel quite fearful about talking about politics. You have to be knowledgable and articulate,\u201d she says. \u201cThat always scares me, as someone who has struggled academically and is highly dyslexic.\u201d If you look online for the most publicised images of Aboah, in among the Fendi, Versace and Gap campaigns you will find photographs of her sitting in the bath, looking vacant and frail, shortly after an attempt to kill herself in 2014. \u201cI look at these photos and I see a different person staring back at me\u2026 the darkness had overtaken me, the grey had engulfed my life, I was broken, exhausted and the light has completely left my eyes,\u201d she wrote about her suicide attempt last year, in an Instagram post to mark World Mental Health Day. Aboah had overdosed; she was in a coma for four days, before recovering in a psychiatric hospital. \u201cI mourn the girl I once was, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019d like to jump into the photo, kiss away the tears, hug her for ever and tell her that she\u2019s not alone.\u201d It was a heartbreaking memo to her younger self, who had a ketamine addiction and poor mental health. Since her recovery, she has spoken frankly about that low point and about her treatment for depression, addiction and bipolar disorder, problems that began much earlier, she says, when she was a teenager at boarding school. \u201cI think it was obvious something was wrong, because I would miss loads of school. I just thought it was because I was really homesick,\u201d Aboah says, matter-of-factly. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel suicidal or anything like that then. I just wanted to jump out of my skin. I felt unhappy and insecure and pressured. But I don\u2019t see why things have to get to rock bottom before you\u2019re able to get help \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be like that. With Gurls Talk, I\u2019ve created a space where we get to talk about those things, where we get to bring all our shit into that room, where anything and everything is important.\u201d Aboah talks constantly about \u201cour girls\u201d and says her work on the podcast is about giving them an opportunity to \u201cswitch off, put your headphones on and, when you are thinking negatively, just block out the outside world. By the end of the episode, I want to give girls the tools to block out the darkness and go forward.\u201d That may sound earnest, but her podcast is a joyful affair, involving interviews with compelling and inspiring young women; a recent episode brought together the champion sprinter Dina Asher-Smith and the hip-hop DJ Tiffany Calver to talk about their competitive natures. It is the kind of frank conversation, about how to navigate the world as a young woman \u2013 and a black woman \u2013 that the teenage Aboah needed. She was raised around the fashion industry: her father, Charles Aboah, is a location scout, while her white, English mother, Camilla Lowther, founded the agency CLM in 1984 and went on to represent many of the biggest photographers, stylists and film-makers in the business. Aboah describes her younger sister Kesewa \u2013 who has modelled for Alexander McQueen and Miu Miu, and recently completed an art degree in New York \u2013 as her \u201csoulmate\u201d. But Aboah felt like the more vulnerable member of her close-knit family. \u201cKesewa has always been the more carefree one. I was always painfully shy,\u201d Aboah says. Her confidence was further knocked by dyslexia, which made school a struggle. \u201cI worked, I tried to get the grades. But an exam based on how much I\u2019d revised didn\u2019t really work with me. I would just get into those exam rooms and fail.\u201d That sense of failure, Aboah now realises, had long-term effects. \u201cThe trauma that surrounds you feeling like you were stupid is something that stays with you for a long time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I got sober that I realised it didn\u2019t matter that I couldn\u2019t punctuate or spell. I could still write if I wanted to.\u201d Drug abuse among her peers added to young Aboah\u2019s demons. \u201cDrugs came quite early on. Too early on,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I went into treatment that I realised that it was very odd that we started taking drugs that young.\u201d It was after Aboah left school \u2013 to do a degree in drama at Brunel University London \u2013 and began working that her drug use, especially of ketamine, began to spiral. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really being that honest. And I was using that as a kind of crutch to make me feel a little bit better,\u201d she says. Aboah had started modelling by then \u2013 at first, fairly informal shoots through her mother\u2019s network, then more professional ones after leaving school and university. Was modelling part of the problem? \u201cMy work ethic at that time wasn\u2019t that great,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI found it quite embarrassing to feel upset about the rejections. So I didn\u2019t really ever sit in the emotions very long. And then I would watch certain girls, and their careers had gone completely differently to mine. They had been supported by British publications and I had never felt that support. I would definitely say there was envy and jealousy. At the same time, I didn\u2019t necessarily care about that side of my life that much.\u201d Her career was on the up, but, battling her demons, Aboah\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in it. *** Growing up, I knew and dearly loved Aboah\u2019s grandparents, met but barely knew her parents, and heard about but never met Aboah. Like many mixed-race children in Britain, we had overlapping Ghanaian families (her father is related to my mother\u2019s family), but we straddled other worlds, too. Neither of us was firmly part of any one community. We were dispersed in different, predominantly white environments, places where our African heritage put us in a minority of one or two. The first time I met Aboah, at a party a couple of years ago, I was struck by her honesty. Whatever the subject, she doesn\u2019t dial it up or down; she approaches every topic, whether her suicide attempt or her plans for the evening, with the same degree of openness, all delivered in a deadpan, impossibly gravelly voice. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way I speak,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI know the importance of sharing one\u2019s story and being really honest about it.\u201d By her own admission, there are some things that come to the surface more easily than others. When she started Gurls Talk, the focus was on mental health experiences. Over time, she began to see the relevance of, and include more discussions about, race and identity. \u201cGrowing up, I saw myself as not-black-enough and not-white-enough,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it was only when I got to boarding school that I was like: \u2018Oh my God, this is an issue.\u2019\u201d Her racial heritage led to a level of exclusion \u2013 \u201clike, watching all the girls in my school wearing Dream Matte Mousse foundation.\u201d The foundation was a 90s sensation, but \u2013 as I can attest \u2013 its colours were a hopeless fit for almost all black skin tones. \u201cI just didn\u2019t understand that putting on \u2018skin-colour\u2019 tights was a thing I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d I tell Aboah that, as a mixed-race girl in a very white school environment, I shared these experiences. I was convinced that boys were not interested in me. \u201cOh, they definitely were not interested in me,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cI could just piece it together from the girls who were idolised. I was never going to look like them. So I immediately thought I was hideous.\u201d The sense of rejection went deep. \u201cI truly believe that if I\u2019d been given some sort of space to really get down to it \u2013 to talk about being a virgin, to talk about my insecurities around my hair, all these things \u2013 it would have made a big difference,\u201d she says. Hair is an issue for so many black women, and Aboah\u2019s experience is no exception. At the beginning of her modelling career, hair anxiety became an unwelcome part of her day. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t possibly explain to someone the embarrassment of sitting in a chair at a modelling job and having 10 people around your head, struggling with your hair,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cOr what it\u2019s like taking your hair out of a ponytail and watching in the mirror as someone goes like this\u201d \u2013 she feigns a catastrophic facial expression. \u201cYou can\u2019t explain to someone what it\u2019s like to wear a hat for four years because you didn\u2019t want someone to touch your hair, or snogging someone, fearing that they might try and put their hands through it when you\u2019ve got your hair grease in it, or they\u2019re going to ruin it. I think only a black girl will ever, ever understand that,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd sometimes I can\u2019t even be bothered to explain it.\u201d In 2015, Aboah entered rehab and recovery, founded Gurls Talk and took a break from modelling. What happened next shows the power of abandoning attempts to please others and, in short, not giving a damn. Because it was when Aboah shaved her head \u2013 against the advice of her agency \u2013 that her career went stratospheric. \u201cEverything feels better when I\u2019m doing me with full force,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is who I am. Rejection feels less painful because I\u2019m being myself. If they don\u2019t get it, someone else will.\u201d *** I sit down a couple of days after our interview to watch her record a Gurls Talk podcast, as she interviews Jawahir Roble, AKA JJ, the first female, Muslim qualified football referee in the UK. In a plush basement studio in London, Aboah draws out JJ\u2019s remarkable life story: how she defied the odds to play football, and then to persuade her sceptical parents that it was what she was supposed to do. Aboah, the schoolgirl who was convinced she was stupid and ugly, is a quick-witted, fluent interviewer. The podcast has a clear structure: Gurls Talk, where the guest shares their story; Gurls Share, where listeners send in their experiences; Gurls Listen, where the guest shares their coping mechanism; Gurls Take Control, where Aboah and her interviewee talk about what they have learned; and Gurls Take Action, where they work out what, practically, they can do next. It sounds prescriptive, but Aboah is so good at guiding JJ through the hour they spend in the recording booth, at bringing out the humour in her story \u2013 how to explain mud on your shoes to the dad who has forbidden you from playing football \u2013 that it works. Later, I ask her how being part of the fashion industry fits with her work around mental health. It is a complicated question, not least for a black woman who knows the power of that industry to foster a sense of exclusion, but also as someone who was born into an affluent family established in that world. \u201cI think about modelling and whether it works alongside everything I advocate,\u201d she says. \u201cI question whether it\u2019s a part of this idea of beauty that does harm. But then I think about the younger me, and seeing someone like me reflected back would 100% have helped her. Just me being unapologetically myself is even more important than my face.\u201d Aboah and her friends talk a lot about race and identity. \u201cPeople always used to ask about my accent and about being posh \u2013 they didn\u2019t really think I could be black because I spoke like that,\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t underestimate my privilege as being more light-skinned. My black friends and I always talk about \u2018the quota\u2019,\u201d (the idea that brands only include a limited number of people of colour, creating opportunities for a privileged few). \u201cIt\u2019s definitely helped me that I fit into a certain box.\u201d While acknowledging her privilege in a world where \u201ccolourism\u201d remains rife, she identifies as black rather than mixed race. \u201cWe don\u2019t really say \u2018mixed race\u2019 any more,\u201d she says, referring to conversations with friends who have one white parent. \u201cWe always say we are black. I think it\u2019s about feeling part of something, feeling part of a movement and a bigger community. I\u2019m like: \u2018Well, I\u2019m not white, am I?\u2019\u201d She says she feels \u201ca massive connective to my African heritage. I will never forget going to my auntie and uncle\u2019s [in Ghana] and getting my hair braided and washing it over the bathtub, the food we would eat, the chilli, sleepovers with family. It is an unbreakable bond.\u201d After a stint living in New York, Aboah is now based in London and counts among her close friends other fashion royalty, such as the model Cara Delevingne and the editor of British Vogue, Edward Enninful (she was his first Vogue cover). At the same time, she is clearly striving to maintain a sense of normality. The last time I saw her was when I went to hear Michelle Obama speak at the Southbank Centre in London, where before the event she chatted excitedly in the stalls along with everyone else. I\u2019ve met her boyfriend \u2013 she keeps details of their relationship private, only saying that, unlike her, he rarely travels. When I ask her how he is, for the first time she becomes bashful and coy. For now, her priority is Gurls Talk, and maintaining a balance in her personal life. She recently took part in a \u201cleadership lab\u201d at the UN, a two-day workshop that brought together female leaders and activists to help them scale up their work. \u201cWe had a lot of sessions and quite a few of the women described having burned themselves out to the point of being hospitalised,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult when you\u2019re doing activism. You don\u2019t go to bed and the job is done \u2013 you wake up and there are still the same problems. You can exhaust yourself, and I have done.\u201d She acknowledges that she is a \u201ccomplete workaholic\u201d. She relies heavily on what she describes as her \u201camazing team\u201d, composed mostly of young women she has chosen to work with in place of more established agents, producers and publicists. The plan is to establish a charity that can move forward even without its famous figurehead. \u201cGurls Talk can stand on its own two feet without me,\u201d Aboah says. \u201cIt\u2019s needed all over the world, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am.\u201d As I leave, she is trying to organise an impromptu football match with her mates. There is no way JJ is going to leave the studio without getting recruited. \u201cYou\u2019re going to play with us, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Aboah asks.

But she always intended to bring him back, or she would have killed him off, \u201cjust to put that to bed\u201d.</p> <p><em>Big Sky</em> started as a screenplay about a female detective, and was originally written for the actor and comedian Victoria Wood, who had appeared in one of the BBC\u2019s Brodie adaptations starring Jason Isaacs. Wood did not see the manuscript before her death in 2016 so Atkinson put it aside, before eventually deciding it would work for Brodie, partly because it is set in Yorkshire, where the detective, like his creator, grew up.</p> <p>The idea for the story began with another Yorkshireman, Jimmy Savile, who had a home in Scarborough, with a plaque \u2013 now removed \u2013 that read \u201cSavile\u2019s View\u201d on the railings overlooking the bay. Although the DJ and TV presenter doesn\u2019t feature in <em>Big Sky</em> directly, he casts a shadow over a sinister web of storylines that connects child abuse rings in the 1970s and 80s to present-day sex trafficking.</p> <p>Atkinson began writing <em>Big Sky</em> the day after she finished <em>Transcription</em>, her second world war espionage novel. Because the idea had been lurking in her mind for so long, she says, it came really quickly, \u201cand I thought, \u2018Well I\u2019ll just keep on.\u2019\u201d But it must have been a jolt to switch from 1950s spies to contemporary sleazebags overnight. \u201cI need to change tack quite vigorously, quite often,\u201d she says. After the initial run of Brodie books, she felt she \u201cnever wanted to write another one of these again\u201d; then, following <em>Life After Life</em>, <em>A God in Ruins</em> and <em>Transcription,</em> she decided: \u201cI must stop writing about the war. I go on a groove for so long and then I have to change.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The world is a darker place and it is an angrier place ... That\u2019s what the politics has done to us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Brodie books always deal \u201cwith things that are happening now\u201d, she stresses. This doesn\u2019t mean writing a Brexit novel, she says, although that subject inevitably creeps in (as she points out, it even features in <em>Transcription</em>). For Brodie \u2013 of all Atkinson\u2019s characters \u201cthe nearest to my kneejerk reaction to things\u201d \u2013 Brexit is \u201cthe end of civilisation as we know it\u201d. As he observes, \u201cthe world had grown darker\u201d. Even by the standards of the series, <em>Big Sky</em> is bleak. Yet it retains the jauntiness that makes Atkinson so wickedly entertaining. \u201cI know, it\u2019s not right somehow,\u201d she says, laughing (she laughs a lot). Since Brodie\u2019s last appearance \u201cthe world is a darker place and it is an angrier place and it is a more bitter place,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what the politics has done to us \u2013 everyone is now anxious all the time, because we don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>There are also echoes of the #MeToo moment as, one after another, the female characters dole out justice or revenge on a pile-up of bad men. Although she didn\u2019t intend <em>Big Sky</em> to be a \u201cstrong women book\u201d it inevitably became one, \u201cbecause all these middle-aged white blokes have to have their comeuppance \u2013 and who is going to give it to them?\u201d As Brodie reflects: \u201cIt was funny how so many men were defined by their downfall. Caesar, Fred Goodwin, Trotsky, Harvey Weinstein, Jimmy Savile. Women hardly ever. They didn\u2019t fall down. They stood up.\u201d She had to add names to the list as she was writing, she jokes, and if she were to write it now there would be even more to include.</p> <p>The honourable exception is our man Brodie, \u201cthe last good man standing\u201d, who always tries \u201cto behave like a gentleman\u201d, and although \u201cknocking on a bit now\u201d, is ready to dive into the sea or jump off a cliff to rescue someone. \u201cHe does have a sheepdog instinct,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cHe knows he\u2019s got to protect women and children.\u201d But he also \u201chas such a strain of darkness in him that he is always going to be responding to the outer darkness\u201d.</p> <p>With his tragic childhood, string of divorces and melancholic outlook, he is the archetypal hard-boiled private eye; the only trait he is missing is a weakness for the bottle. \u201cI like to take cliches and try and work with them,\u201d she says. But when she first set him to work, she was nervous because she \u201chadn\u2019t really written a male character of any substance before\u201d, and she had no intention of writing a crime novel, let alone a detective series to sit alongside Ian Rankin\u2019s Rebus or Colin Dexter\u2019s Inspector Morse books. But \u201cif you put a detective in a novel it becomes a detective novel, there\u2019s no way round it\u201d. Where traditional crime fiction is \u201cvery narrative driven, like a trail\u201d, Atkinson\u2019s genius for plotting, combined with an acute sympathy for the inner lives of her characters, has created what she likes to call \u201ca genre of Jackson Brodie\u201d (her publishers plump for \u201cliterary crime novel\u201d). Readers who would never pick up a crime novel are \u201cthe biggest Jackson Brodie fans now\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"136da477049274d625ecab429ecba17414ce90e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/136da477049274d625ecab429ecba17414ce90e2/0_0_3550_2362/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brody\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last good man standing \u2026 Jason Isaacs as Jackson Brody.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above all, the detective is a great device for bringing together multiple storylines and huge casts \u2013 Hilary Mantel once wrote that Atkinson must have \u201ca game plan more sophisticated than Dickens\u201d. \u201cThere are a lot of characters,\u201d she concedes. Does her study resemble a procedural room in a TV police drama, covered with sprawling spider diagrams? \u201cIt is your working world and you know where everybody is and what everybody needs to do,\u201d she says. \u201cI can do it while I\u2019m writing it, afterwards I can\u2019t even remember anyone\u2019s name.\u201d She loves an ending (hence the seemingly endless endings of <em>Life After Life</em>), somehow managing to tie everything up with forensic neatness. \u201cEverybody gets their just deserts.\u201d</p> <p>The question of justice recurs throughout Atkinson\u2019s fiction, which always operates according to its own morality (the bodycount in a Brodie novel often rivals that of an episode of <em>Game of Thrones</em>). In <em>Big Sky</em> \u201ceveryone is breaking the law\u201d, or taking it into their own hands in one way or another. Brodie fans will welcome the reappearance of Reggie, last seen as a 16-year-old nanny in 2008\u2019s<em> When Will There Be Good News?</em>, now a young policewoman. \u201cWhat else would she become?\u201d Atkinson asks. \u201cNow she\u2019s never going to be allowed to be happy. Because she\u2019s always going to be seeing bad things. She will be fulfilled.\u201d</p> <p>Atkinson has said that \u201cyou can\u2019t write a novel about happy people having happy lives\u201d. \u201cThere is so much misery around, I never seem to get round to it.\u201d But the author herself always seems remarkably cheery, in a no-nonsense Yorkshire way. \u201cI am, on the whole,\u201d she agrees, with that laugh. \u201cIf I was really gloomy would I write different books? Maybe this is the place for it \u2013 it frees you up, because then you don\u2019t have to dwell in it.\u201d</p> <p>She was, however, a very fearful, anxious child, something she attributes to being \u201cillegitimate\u201d and not having a sibling (her parents were together, but her mother was unable to get divorced following a disastrous wartime marriage). \u201cThere was a lot of suppressed emotion.\u201d Born in 1951 and growing up above her parents\u2019 shop in York, she was left largely to her own devices. She also wonders if she might have been \u201ctainted\u201d by her father\u2019s own miserable childhood \u2013 one of poverty, violence and random accident \u2013 which she only discovered after his death, and which reads like the backstory of one of her characters. (His grandmother, with whom he lived until he was 10, died falling from a table trying to get a fly paper down \u2013 \u201ca wonderful little story: \u2018Imagine the fly!\u2019\u201d)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>You are not allowed in this country to be confident; women aren\u2019t allowed to say \u2018I think this is really good'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Until her early 30s she never thought about becoming a writer: \u201cI was a reader, that was my part in the whole book process.\u201d But she won the Women\u2019s Own short story competition \u2013 \u201cthe best moment of my life\u201d \u2013 for \u201cthe very first thing I wrote that had nothing to do with me\u201d. This led to an apprenticeship in magazine stories: \u201cgetting everything in there in a very short space \u2026 that was how I learned to write.\u201d</p> <p>She published <em>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</em> when she was 43. \u201cEveryone said, you are quite old to have your first novel published, and I\u2019d think, \u2018Well, now I can get on with it, I\u2019ve done all the difficult things \u2026 living.\u2019\u201d She had been married twice and has two daughters and now granddaughters. <em>Behind the Scenes</em> won the Whitbread book of the year award in 1995, beating such big literary beasts as Salman Rushdie, which caused a bit of a brouhaha, with headlines such as \u201cUnknown chambermaid wins prize\u201d (she had once worked in a hotel). The whole experience \u201ctainted me for ever\u201d, she says now, and she has been wary of interviews ever since. \u201cI always feel as if I want to live as if I have a monastery inside me \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be giving away all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Although \u201cYorkshire will be written on my heart for ever\u201d, she has spent most of her writing life in Edinburgh, which \u201ccuts you off. I am beyond the wall.\u201d She doesn\u2019t enjoy parties or networking, \u201cstuff that I always presume is happening in London all the time\u201d. Although the day after we meet she is having lunch with her longtime friend Ali Smith \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s literally the only writer I know\u201d, and they never talk about writing, \u201cNever!\u201d They will be celebrating their joint No 1 positions in the hardback and paperback bestseller lists (for <em>Transcription</em> and for Smith\u2019s <em>Spring</em> ).</p> <p>Atkinson<em> </em>has never suffered from \u201cblank-page syndrome\u201d and is already at work on two novels simultaneously \u2013 \u201cIt wakes me up a bit\u201d \u2013 one of which is another Brodie. \u201cYes, he\u2019s coming back in a very funny book\u201d: an Agatha Christie homage.

      "bodyText": "After nearly 10 years, Kate Atkinson\u2019s much-loved detective Jackson Brodie returns in her 12th novel Big Sky. \u201cThe best mystery of the decade\u201d, Stephen King wrote of Case Histories, Brodie\u2019s first appearance back in 2004, but it looked as if he might have been retired for ever after his fourth outing in 2010. \u201cBrodie did have a really long holiday,\u201d the author says. During which time, Atkinson won the Costa best novel award twice, for her historical novels Life After Life and A God in Ruins, and wrote last year\u2019s Transcription. But she always intended to bring him back, or she would have killed him off, \u201cjust to put that to bed\u201d. Big Sky started as a screenplay about a female detective, and was originally written for the actor and comedian Victoria Wood, who had appeared in one of the BBC\u2019s Brodie adaptations starring Jason Isaacs. Wood did not see the manuscript before her death in 2016 so Atkinson put it aside, before eventually deciding it would work for Brodie, partly because it is set in Yorkshire, where the detective, like his creator, grew up. The idea for the story began with another Yorkshireman, Jimmy Savile, who had a home in Scarborough, with a plaque \u2013 now removed \u2013 that read \u201cSavile\u2019s View\u201d on the railings overlooking the bay. Although the DJ and TV presenter doesn\u2019t feature in Big Sky directly, he casts a shadow over a sinister web of storylines that connects child abuse rings in the 1970s and 80s to present-day sex trafficking. Atkinson began writing Big Sky the day after she finished Transcription, her second world war espionage novel. Because the idea had been lurking in her mind for so long, she says, it came really quickly, \u201cand I thought, \u2018Well I\u2019ll just keep on.\u2019\u201d But it must have been a jolt to switch from 1950s spies to contemporary sleazebags overnight. \u201cI need to change tack quite vigorously, quite often,\u201d she says. After the initial run of Brodie books, she felt she \u201cnever wanted to write another one of these again\u201d; then, following Life After Life, A God in Ruins and Transcription, she decided: \u201cI must stop writing about the war. I go on a groove for so long and then I have to change.\u201d The Brodie books always deal \u201cwith things that are happening now\u201d, she stresses. This doesn\u2019t mean writing a Brexit novel, she says, although that subject inevitably creeps in (as she points out, it even features in Transcription). For Brodie \u2013 of all Atkinson\u2019s characters \u201cthe nearest to my kneejerk reaction to things\u201d \u2013 Brexit is \u201cthe end of civilisation as we know it\u201d.

Yet it retains the jauntiness that makes Atkinson so wickedly entertaining. \u201cI know, it\u2019s not right somehow,\u201d she says, laughing (she laughs a lot). Since Brodie\u2019s last appearance \u201cthe world is a darker place and it is an angrier place and it is a more bitter place,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what the politics has done to us \u2013 everyone is now anxious all the time, because we don\u2019t know what is going to happen.\u201d There are also echoes of the #MeToo moment as, one after another, the female characters dole out justice or revenge on a pile-up of bad men.

(His grandmother, with whom he lived until he was 10, died falling from a table trying to get a fly paper down \u2013 \u201ca wonderful little story: \u2018Imagine the fly!\u2019\u201d) Until her early 30s she never thought about becoming a writer: \u201cI was a reader, that was my part in the whole book process.\u201d But she won the Women\u2019s Own short story competition \u2013 \u201cthe best moment of my life\u201d \u2013 for \u201cthe very first thing I wrote that had nothing to do with me\u201d. This led to an apprenticeship in magazine stories: \u201cgetting everything in there in a very short space \u2026 that was how I learned to write.\u201d She published Behind the Scenes at the Museum when she was 43. \u201cEveryone said, you are quite old to have your first novel published, and I\u2019d think, \u2018Well, now I can get on with it, I\u2019ve done all the difficult things \u2026 living.\u2019\u201d She had been married twice and has two daughters and now granddaughters. Behind the Scenes won the Whitbread book of the year award in 1995, beating such big literary beasts as Salman Rushdie, which caused a bit of a brouhaha, with headlines such as \u201cUnknown chambermaid wins prize\u201d (she had once worked in a hotel). The whole experience \u201ctainted me for ever\u201d, she says now, and she has been wary of interviews ever since. \u201cI always feel as if I want to live as if I have a monastery inside me \u2026 I don\u2019t want to be giving away all the time.\u201d Although \u201cYorkshire will be written on my heart for ever\u201d, she has spent most of her writing life in Edinburgh, which \u201ccuts you off. I am beyond the wall.\u201d She doesn\u2019t enjoy parties or networking, \u201cstuff that I always presume is happening in London all the time\u201d. Although the day after we meet she is having lunch with her longtime friend Ali Smith \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019s literally the only writer I know\u201d, and they never talk about writing, \u201cNever!\u201d They will be celebrating their joint No 1 positions in the hardback and paperback bestseller lists (for Transcription and for Smith\u2019s Spring ). Atkinson has never suffered from \u201cblank-page syndrome\u201d and is already at work on two novels simultaneously \u2013 \u201cIt wakes me up a bit\u201d \u2013 one of which is another Brodie. \u201cYes, he\u2019s coming back in a very funny book\u201d: an Agatha Christie homage. She\u2019s had the beginning and the title for ages \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ve got titles to sell\u201d \u2013 and has already written the ending. \u201cI\u2019m in Jackson Brodie mode, so I may as well do it now as opposed to putting it on the shelf of ideas I have.\u201d Next on the shelf is her \u201cBig Book\u201d, a return to York and to the second world war, called The Line of Sight. As she has got older, she enjoys writing more. But \u201cit has really bad moments. A lot of the time it is completely tedious, but one good sentence can pay off for many, many years of tedium or hell.\u201d When the novel is completed, \u201cit\u2019s done for ever. It\u2019s in the world\u201d, and she\u2019s \u201chappy just to lie there and watch Netflix all night long, because I need to just empty all that stuff out.\u201d She has always felt \u201ca certain confidence\u201d in her writing, \u201cbut you are not allowed in this country to be confident; women aren\u2019t allowed to say \u2018I think this is really good\u2019.\u201d While readers and critics were dazzled by the formal ingenuity of Life After Life, it is its sequel, A God in Ruins, that she believes to be her best work, \u201cand will remain so\u201d, she says emphatically. \u201cThat\u2019s the book I always wanted to write. People are always telling me how they cried at the end.\u201d But she has never made the Booker shortlist (perhaps because she is percieved to be a \u201cgenre writer\u201d \u2013 \u201cthere\u2019s no hope for me\u201d), and won\u2019t be on any future longlists as she has asked her publishers not to submit her work for prizes any more: \u201cAs long as I meet my own standards, that\u2019s enough.\u201d \u201cTo have moved someone to tears and to move to them to laughter is great,\u201d she says. \u201cI live to entertain, I don\u2019t live to teach or to preach or to be political. If I have a job to do it is to entertain myself first and then everyone else afterwards.\u201d \u2022 Big Sky by Kate Atkinson is published by Doubleday (\u00a320).

      "body": "<p>In May 2004, the actor Lisa Kudrow met her colleague Michael Patrick King for lunch in Los Angeles. Kudrow had just finished playing the part of Phoebe Buffay in Friends, and King had ended his run as director, writer and executive producer for Sex and the City. They had known each other for years and now they were considering working together. It should have been a match made in TV heaven but Kudrow brought a little bit of TV hell along to that lunch date, too.</p> <p>\u201cHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t imagine you want to do another show,\u2019 and I said: \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Kudrow recalls. \u201cThe only thing I would want to do was this \u2026 \u201d She then assumed the persona of a very different sort of performer: a jaded, craven, fading TV star, driven a little screwy by fame. \u201cShe\u2019s really phoney,\u201d Kudrow says. \u201cShe\u2019s so desperate to be in the spotlight, and she\u2019s missed it so much. She had this weird, continental-ish, theatre-y accent.\u201d</p> <p>Kudrow\u2019s character was not a new creation. It pre-dated Friends, and was something she had come up with while training with the Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe in Los Angeles. \u201cWe would do these character monologues,\u201d she says. \u201cI had one called \u2018Your favourite actress on a talkshow\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t even give her a name.\u201d</p> <p>King loved the performance. \u201cThis character was so completely unaware of reality and, basically, her own ego,\u201d he says. \u201cI started laughing and we started talking.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThree hours later, we had a TV show,\u201d says Kudrow.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIvmAwSRk_A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fIvmAwSRk_A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>King knew that it would be difficult to make a successful show about a TV star to whom viewers could still relate. However, there was another type of programme that had been picking up ratings. \u201cIt was the dawn of reality TV and, in the writers\u2019 rooms, people were freaking out,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI remember season one or two of [US reality show] The Amazing Race,\u201d says Kudrow. \u201cI saw a married couple given a challenge where she had to eat such spicy food that she could barely swallow. She was vomiting and crying while her husband was screaming at her: \u2018Finish it!\u2019 I thought: \u2018That\u2019s the most humiliating thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 And it was on national television.\u201d</p> <p>Together they came up with an equally humiliating formula, pairing Lisa\u2019s blowsy old actor persona with this violent new format to create The Comeback, perhaps the best comedy about television in the 21st century. The first season, which aired on HBO in 2005, followed the tribulations of Valerie Cherish (Kudrow), a hapless LA actor who, having starred in a sitcom during the late-80s and early-90s, tries to find fame again, not only by signing up to play the part of a cranky old aunt in a second-rate teen sitcom, but also by agreeing to a reality show documenting her attempt to make it back on to the small screen.</p> <p>The series is presented as found footage from that reality show. \u201cThe Office came first,\u201d Kudrow admits. \u201cI was a fan; it definitely informed it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite its loose, apparently improvised feel, this new show was actually heavily scripted by Kudrow and King. \u201cWe wrote it out, right down to the \u2018Ah, ah, ah\u2019 pauses in speech,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Those lines were quite unlike anything Kudrow had performed on Friends. \u201cFriends was joke-driven,\u201d she says. \u201cThis didn\u2019t have that; it didn\u2019t have to be hilarious every second.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, The Comeback\u2019s own fake sitcom, Room and Bored, enabled the show to satirise the crummy comedies that were once the mainstay of American broadcast TV. King says there was one show from the early-90s that he had in mind. \u201cIt was called Down the Shore,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the quality of the writing, which was fine, it was that they were trying to pretend they were on the ocean, with the ocean in the background as a drop; that felt so fake to me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5849aba0e2d3188bafa79cc7f001fdba800c8f5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5849aba0e2d3188bafa79cc7f001fdba800c8f5e/296_0_3960_2376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lisa Kudrow with Robert Michael Morris in The Comeback.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lisa Kudrow with Robert Michael Morris in The Comeback.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kudrow feels the parody was much broader and, at the same time, more acute. \u201cThere were so many of those comedies that had two-dimensional characters and weren\u2019t that funny,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes the writers just seemed to hate the audience. I remember saying to writers, on earlier shows \u2013 not Friends \u2013 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better, if this happened or that happened\u2019, and they\u2019d be like: \u2018No that doesn\u2019t matter. The audience is just stupid. I thought: \u2018No, that\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The true villain of The Comeback is Room and Bored\u2019s writer Paulie G (played by Lance Barber), a bro\u2019-ish bully who delights in ridiculing Valerie. Watching the show today, it is hard not to see his treatment of Kudrow\u2019s character as a wider comment on media misogyny, but she is reluctant to accept that label. \u201cWe didn\u2019t call it that,\u201d she says, \u201cthat was just the truth, the reality; that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTV writers perceived any woman over 40 as not fuckable,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s in the DNA of many, many writers\u2019 rooms. The show is the closest thing to my experience in writing rooms, with male energy and the sophomoric madness that happens when people are trapped, trying to do a series.\u201d Much of the first season\u2019s spark lay in the way Valerie\u2019s old-school brassy resilience was worn thin by Paulie G\u2019s coarser approach. In fact, Kudrow believes the uneasy reception the show met when it was first aired came from the discomfort male viewers experienced watching so raw a depiction of male-on-female cruelty.</p> <p>\u201cThe feedback from that first season was that it was really hard to watch,\u201d says Kudrow. \u201cI think for men especially it was really uncomfortable. I was aware that it was mainly straight, white guys who couldn\u2019t watch it.\u201d</p> <p>King also thinks that Valerie was a challenge for audiences but the reason was because she was too nuanced. \u201cMost comedy is built on archetypes,\u201d he says, \u201cand in most TV comedies, the female archetypes were very, very limited. There was the sexy young one that everyone wanted to have sex with, and then there was the kooky, older one, who was over the hill. You weren\u2019t both.\u201d</p> <p>Despite respectable viewing figures \u2013 \u201cIt was getting about the same as Entourage got in their first year,\u201d says Kudrow \u2013 the show was cancelled. And then something quite odd happened: after it came off the air, viewers and critics alike began to reassess The Comeback. \u201cThey actually published revised reviews,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was rare; it was crazy rare!\u201d</p> <p>In 2014, 10 years after that first lunch date, when reality shows had all but conquered daytime TV and The Comeback\u2019s reputation had been restored, a second season aired, with Valerie cast in another fictional production \u2013 Seeing Red, an HBO dramatisation of her tortuous experience filming Room and Bored \u2013 and again simultaneously working on a reality production.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we did the second season, we addressed HBO and streaming services and where Valerie had gone,\u201d says King. \u201cShe was angry, an alcoholic and she didn\u2019t have to smile. She was dark, and the joke was for us: Valerie was being forced to be dark when all she wanted to be was light and loved. She was being hated; she became a success. That\u2019s where television is now.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this darkness, the second series may actually make for easier viewing; it certainly met with greater conventional success. It was, King admits, as if the world had caught up with Valerie and her hapless ambitions. \u201cValerie is my cautionary tale of choosing fame over family,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of my scariest thoughts, that someone would choose this illusive thing over the real people in their lives.\u201d</p> <p>Unfortunately, the death of one of those very real people in King and Kudrow\u2019s life may mean we won\u2019t see a third series of The Comeback. The actor and dramatist Robert Michael Morris had been King\u2019s theatre teacher at college, before becoming a professional actor later in life.

      "bodyText": "In May 2004, the actor Lisa Kudrow met her colleague Michael Patrick King for lunch in Los Angeles. Kudrow had just finished playing the part of Phoebe Buffay in Friends, and King had ended his run as director, writer and executive producer for Sex and the City. They had known each other for years and now they were considering working together. It should have been a match made in TV heaven but Kudrow brought a little bit of TV hell along to that lunch date, too. \u201cHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t imagine you want to do another show,\u2019 and I said: \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Kudrow recalls. \u201cThe only thing I would want to do was this \u2026 \u201d She then assumed the persona of a very different sort of performer: a jaded, craven, fading TV star, driven a little screwy by fame. \u201cShe\u2019s really phoney,\u201d Kudrow says. \u201cShe\u2019s so desperate to be in the spotlight, and she\u2019s missed it so much. She had this weird, continental-ish, theatre-y accent.\u201d Kudrow\u2019s character was not a new creation. It pre-dated Friends, and was something she had come up with while training with the Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe in Los Angeles. \u201cWe would do these character monologues,\u201d she says. \u201cI had one called \u2018Your favourite actress on a talkshow\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t even give her a name.\u201d King loved the performance. \u201cThis character was so completely unaware of reality and, basically, her own ego,\u201d he says. \u201cI started laughing and we started talking.\u201d \u201cThree hours later, we had a TV show,\u201d says Kudrow. King knew that it would be difficult to make a successful show about a TV star to whom viewers could still relate. However, there was another type of programme that had been picking up ratings. \u201cIt was the dawn of reality TV and, in the writers\u2019 rooms, people were freaking out,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember season one or two of [US reality show] The Amazing Race,\u201d says Kudrow. \u201cI saw a married couple given a challenge where she had to eat such spicy food that she could barely swallow. She was vomiting and crying while her husband was screaming at her: \u2018Finish it!\u2019 I thought: \u2018That\u2019s the most humiliating thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 And it was on national television.\u201d Together they came up with an equally humiliating formula, pairing Lisa\u2019s blowsy old actor persona with this violent new format to create The Comeback, perhaps the best comedy about television in the 21st century. The first season, which aired on HBO in 2005, followed the tribulations of Valerie Cherish (Kudrow), a hapless LA actor who, having starred in a sitcom during the late-80s and early-90s, tries to find fame again, not only by signing up to play the part of a cranky old aunt in a second-rate teen sitcom, but also by agreeing to a reality show documenting her attempt to make it back on to the small screen. The series is presented as found footage from that reality show. \u201cThe Office came first,\u201d Kudrow admits. \u201cI was a fan; it definitely informed it.\u201d Despite its loose, apparently improvised feel, this new show was actually heavily scripted by Kudrow and King. \u201cWe wrote it out, right down to the \u2018Ah, ah, ah\u2019 pauses in speech,\u201d he says. Those lines were quite unlike anything Kudrow had performed on Friends. \u201cFriends was joke-driven,\u201d she says. \u201cThis didn\u2019t have that; it didn\u2019t have to be hilarious every second.\u201d Indeed, The Comeback\u2019s own fake sitcom, Room and Bored, enabled the show to satirise the crummy comedies that were once the mainstay of American broadcast TV. King says there was one show from the early-90s that he had in mind. \u201cIt was called Down the Shore,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the quality of the writing, which was fine, it was that they were trying to pretend they were on the ocean, with the ocean in the background as a drop; that felt so fake to me.\u201d Kudrow feels the parody was much broader and, at the same time, more acute. \u201cThere were so many of those comedies that had two-dimensional characters and weren\u2019t that funny,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes the writers just seemed to hate the audience. I remember saying to writers, on earlier shows \u2013 not Friends \u2013 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better, if this happened or that happened\u2019, and they\u2019d be like: \u2018No that doesn\u2019t matter. The audience is just stupid. I thought: \u2018No, that\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201d The true villain of The Comeback is Room and Bored\u2019s writer Paulie G (played by Lance Barber), a bro\u2019-ish bully who delights in ridiculing Valerie. Watching the show today, it is hard not to see his treatment of Kudrow\u2019s character as a wider comment on media misogyny, but she is reluctant to accept that label. \u201cWe didn\u2019t call it that,\u201d she says, \u201cthat was just the truth, the reality; that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d \u201cTV writers perceived any woman over 40 as not fuckable,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s in the DNA of many, many writers\u2019 rooms. The show is the closest thing to my experience in writing rooms, with male energy and the sophomoric madness that happens when people are trapped, trying to do a series.\u201d Much of the first season\u2019s spark lay in the way Valerie\u2019s old-school brassy resilience was worn thin by Paulie G\u2019s coarser approach. In fact, Kudrow believes the uneasy reception the show met when it was first aired came from the discomfort male viewers experienced watching so raw a depiction of male-on-female cruelty. \u201cThe feedback from that first season was that it was really hard to watch,\u201d says Kudrow. \u201cI think for men especially it was really uncomfortable. I was aware that it was mainly straight, white guys who couldn\u2019t watch it.\u201d King also thinks that Valerie was a challenge for audiences but the reason was because she was too nuanced. \u201cMost comedy is built on archetypes,\u201d he says, \u201cand in most TV comedies, the female archetypes were very, very limited. There was the sexy young one that everyone wanted to have sex with, and then there was the kooky, older one, who was over the hill. You weren\u2019t both.\u201d Despite respectable viewing figures \u2013 \u201cIt was getting about the same as Entourage got in their first year,\u201d says Kudrow \u2013 the show was cancelled. And then something quite odd happened: after it came off the air, viewers and critics alike began to reassess The Comeback. \u201cThey actually published revised reviews,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was rare; it was crazy rare!\u201d In 2014, 10 years after that first lunch date, when reality shows had all but conquered daytime TV and The Comeback\u2019s reputation had been restored, a second season aired, with Valerie cast in another fictional production \u2013 Seeing Red, an HBO dramatisation of her tortuous experience filming Room and Bored \u2013 and again simultaneously working on a reality production. \u201cWhen we did the second season, we addressed HBO and streaming services and where Valerie had gone,\u201d says King. \u201cShe was angry, an alcoholic and she didn\u2019t have to smile. She was dark, and the joke was for us: Valerie was being forced to be dark when all she wanted to be was light and loved. She was being hated; she became a success. That\u2019s where television is now.\u201d Despite this darkness, the second series may actually make for easier viewing; it certainly met with greater conventional success. It was, King admits, as if the world had caught up with Valerie and her hapless ambitions. \u201cValerie is my cautionary tale of choosing fame over family,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of my scariest thoughts, that someone would choose this illusive thing over the real people in their lives.\u201d Unfortunately, the death of one of those very real people in King and Kudrow\u2019s life may mean we won\u2019t see a third series of The Comeback. The actor and dramatist Robert Michael Morris had been King\u2019s theatre teacher at college, before becoming a professional actor later in life. Morris had retired by the time The Comeback was casting, but King more or less wrote the part of Mickey, Valerie\u2019s hairdresser and best friend, for him, and convinced Morris to come out of retirement to perform on the show. Despite a spell of ill health, Morris reprised the role in the second season, but died in the spring of 2017. Kudrow says she really cannot see how she could make another series. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing funny about that, and you have to address it,\u201d she sighs. So is his passing preventing her from considering another series? \u201cIt is right now,\u201d she says. King, despite having known Morris for longer, is a little more sanguine. \u201cTelevision is always evolving,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can always put Valerie\u2019s head in the window and then slam it.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Sister Christine Charlwood, 91</strong></h2> <p>I was 23 when I became a nun, in 1951. The convent I was sent to had 20 nuns, with an average age of 33. Those were very different times: communities nowadays are much smaller and live in accommodation suited to the circumstances, in groups of two, three or four, in houses or flats.</p> <p>We no longer wear a habit but dress in the original purple of our order, St Augustine. But the tradition is the same: we hold together in prayer and activity. The glue is praying together: morning, midday, evening and night.</p> <p>There are four of us in our community: I\u2019m the eldest and the youngest is 45. Jess and I have known each other for years, but we hadn\u2019t lived together until three years ago. We\u2019ve got a lot in common. We both love poetry, and we tend to be on the same wavelength.</p> <h2><strong>Sister Jessica Gatty, 80</strong></h2> <p>We live in a lovely, spacious house with a big garden and I do sometimes think: where\u2019s the poverty in this? But poverty is also about sharing. We invite students from the university nearby to have meals with us once a week, and we are careful not to waste food. We are very ecologically aware \u2013 we have solar panels.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/08/how-we-live-together-single-dad-son\">How we live together: the single dad and son</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a rota for cooking and we try to eat supper together every evening. We all have roles outside the community \u2013 we\u2019re trustees of charities, for example, and one member teaches English to a Syrian family \u2013 but we try to be more than ships in the night. Christine and I are very keen on current affairs: we\u2019re glued to the evening news. Our conversations tend not to be frivolous, but we\u2019re not too serious. We make sure we have fun as well.</p> <p>\u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/nov/10/tell-us-who-do-you-share-your-home-with\" title=\"\">fill in this form</a> and tell us a little about your set-up.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sister Christine Charlwood, 91 I was 23 when I became a nun, in 1951. The convent I was sent to had 20 nuns, with an average age of 33. Those were very different times: communities nowadays are much smaller and live in accommodation suited to the circumstances, in groups of two, three or four, in houses or flats. We no longer wear a habit but dress in the original purple of our order, St Augustine. But the tradition is the same: we hold together in prayer and activity. The glue is praying together: morning, midday, evening and night. There are four of us in our community: I\u2019m the eldest and the youngest is 45. Jess and I have known each other for years, but we hadn\u2019t lived together until three years ago. We\u2019ve got a lot in common. We both love poetry, and we tend to be on the same wavelength. Sister Jessica Gatty, 80 We live in a lovely, spacious house with a big garden and I do sometimes think: where\u2019s the poverty in this? But poverty is also about sharing. We invite students from the university nearby to have meals with us once a week, and we are careful not to waste food. We are very ecologically aware \u2013 we have solar panels. There is a rota for cooking and we try to eat supper together every evening. We all have roles outside the community \u2013 we\u2019re trustees of charities, for example, and one member teaches English to a Syrian family \u2013 but we try to be more than ships in the night. Christine and I are very keen on current affairs: we\u2019re glued to the evening news. Our conversations tend not to be frivolous, but we\u2019re not too serious. We make sure we have fun as well. \u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up.",

      "bodyText": "An investigation has been launched after an A-level maths paper was circulated online before the exam. Images of the test paper by Edexcel appeared on social media on Thursday afternoon. The exam board\u2019s parent company, Pearson, said the images \u201cwere circulated in a very limited way\u201d before students sat the exam on Friday. \u201cHaving visited a small group of centres within scope of the investigation, we have identified one centre in serious breach of correct practice,\u201d the firm said. \u201cAll students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.\u201d Two questions from the paper first appeared on Twitter in a since-deleted post which offered students the whole paper for \u00a370. It is not the first time Pearson has had maths papers leaked. Last year, an A-level maths paper apparently appeared for sale online the night before thousands of students sat the exam. The company was also forced to make last-minute changes to two A-level papers in 2017 after receiving reports that some students had gained access to them in advance. Both leaks were investigated by the police, with evidence passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought. In April, it was revealed that Pearson would pilot a scheme in which exam papers would be microchipped to track the date, time and location of each bundle. An online petition calling for the exam board to take the leak into consideration when it set grade boundaries has been signed by hundreds of students. The petition\u2019s creator, Jenny Li, described the situation as \u201cvery unfair\u201d for students who had not seen the paper before the exam. A student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the leak. \u201cI\u2019m not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper; it wasn\u2019t that kind of frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more the frustration that I\u2019ve spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students through some sort of opportunity could have not learned anything for two years \u2013 and just spent \u00a370 and got an A-level.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Last Christmas, while I was visiting my parents at the house where I grew up, I watched Mum throw away some spice mix. Much of it missed the bin and the seeds, spices and herbs scattered about the kitchen floor. Mum didn\u2019t notice, or didn\u2019t care, so I grabbed a dustpan and brush. As I swept, I found plenty more down there: breadcrumbs, cheese, ham, porridge, dog hair, something sticky. Later, Mum mixed cocktails. I had come prepared, so, before taking a sip, I whipped a baby wipe from my pocket and gave my glass a surreptitious clean. Mum and my stepdad started talking about their plans to become Airbnb hosts, at which point I nearly choked on a cashew nut. They simply can\u2019t see mess, I thought, and then I remembered that, until quite recently, neither could I.</p> <p>When I was growing up, the house was always untidy. There were piles of clothes on the landing, toys all over the living room, black marks on the hall tiles where coal had fallen from the scuttle we lugged in from the shed, dust on the surfaces, apple cores stuffed down the back of the sofa, discarded crisp packets, breakfast bowls on the coffee table, yellow gunge on the kitchen radio, and entire rooms we couldn\u2019t enter because the doors were blocked shut by stacks of furniture, sculpture, paintings. I didn\u2019t care: mess was all I knew, although there were hair-raising moments, such as when I was washing the dishes and saw something orange working its way up through the plughole. It turned out to be two slugs that had somehow got into the overflow. One Christmas, I accused the dog of having nibbled a bar of chocolate under the tree: \u201cIt was probably a rat,\u201d said Mum, casually.</p> <p>Nowadays, I share a flat with my wife Lucy, and I\u2019m tidy \u2013 perhaps obsessively so. As I scrub the floors and put things away after a meal, or use the vacuum\u2019s special nozzle to suck up far-flung specks of dust on Sunday mornings, I think about how the untidiness I grew up in has affected important areas of my life \u2013 my studies, work, relationships. I\u2019m nervous of broaching this subject with Mum, as I don\u2019t want her to think I have complaints about my upbringing (I don\u2019t). When I eventually ask her about it, Mum laughs and quotes my dad\u2019s parting shot from 1988: \u201cIt would have been easier to stay if I\u2019d been able to find a clean teaspoon.\u201d</p> <p>Then she recalls a Friday evening when she took my brother Casper and me out for fish and chips: \u201cI left the radio playing, the lights on, front door unlocked. When we got home, two neighbours were coming down the stairs. They said, \u2018Thank goodness you\u2019re alive.\u2019 They thought the house had been ransacked and some terrible <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/16/truman-capote-in-cold-blood\" title=\"\">In Cold Blood</a>-type scenario had happened. But the house was just in its usual state.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When my now wife visited my student room, I had one mug, which I\u2019d never washed. I made tea for her in it</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mum also reminds me that, as a child, I liked looking at estate agents\u2019 ads, particularly for new-build bungalows. \u201cYou wanted a house like Gary and Kevin\u2019s,\u201d she says of the charismatic twins at my school, who lived in a spotless beige house on a cul-de-sac. It\u2019s true, I envied Gary and Kevin, but I thought that was because they were good at football. I never thought it was about tidiness. And anyway, when Kevin came to do some plastering at our house last year, he told Mum: \u201cI used to love coming here as a kid.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, I remember times when I did feel self-conscious about our home. A sleepover had to be abandoned when an asthmatic friend reacted to the dust. Another mate came for tea, refused to eat anything and the next day at school said our house was \u201cscruffy\u201d. We had a fight about that, so I must have been hurt. But we made up and, throughout the summer holidays, went fishing together and came back to my house at lunchtime, traipsing mud and pond water inside, to eat the sandwiches that Mum made for us.</p> <p>A few miles outside St Ives in Cornwall, the house was never squalid and remains full of colour, warmth and books. It\u2019s a nice place to be. During the festive period, guests come over almost every evening for elaborate dinners and sit around the table long into the night, laughing, arguing and drinking mum\u2019s damson gin. The living room walls are papered in Ordnance Survey maps of places of personal significance \u2013 north London, where Lucy and I lived; Yorkshire, where we both studied; Barcelona, where Casper lives, and various sites of my parents\u2019 own formative years. The maps overlap, creating a disorienting family geography, while the flickering fire casts shadows across them. But why exactly has the house always been such a mess?</p> <p>Mum, a 68-year-old painter, sees it simply. \u201cI could always think of something better to do than cleaning up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s fruitless, completely non-creative. Tidiness is about fear of letting yourself go, but I think letting yourself go is when you can really be yourself. Both my husbands were useless about housework \u2013 but while women are judged for being untidy, men never are.\u201d</p> <p>Did she ever feel embarrassed when people came over? \u201cI hated it when they turned up unexpectedly. Certain friends always arrived when I\u2019d just set something on fire.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6060791dc2ce703442cd3e5c5d81957c0425c8a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6060791dc2ce703442cd3e5c5d81957c0425c8a6/0_328_4959_2808/1000.jpg\" alt=\"rat against white background\" width=\"1000\" height=\"566\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Who nibbled the chocolate under the Christmas tree? \u201cIt was probably a rat,\u201d said Mum, casually.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrii Hrytsenko/Alamy Stock Photo/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So how exactly did I learn to be clean and tidy?</p> <p>I ask my university housemate, Will, for his memories of the year we spent living together. \u201cI\u2019m amused to hear you say you\u2019ve become obsessive about cleanliness,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not sure you even knew what cleaning was. I remember after about three months, I discovered you dragging the bins through to the front of the house, juice dribbling on to the hall carpet. You didn\u2019t know the bins were collected out the back, because until then I had taken them out every single week.\u201d</p> <p>The following year, I moved back into university halls, in part because Will warned a potential flatmate that I was a nightmare to live with. I felt ashamed when I heard about that, but by then I\u2019d started seeing Lucy.</p> <p>The first time Lucy came to my room, I explained that I only had one cup, so we would have to take it in turns to have tea. I had never washed this cup; I figured I was the only one to use it, so \u2013 why bother? Fifteen years later, I remind Lucy of this and she says, \u201cI didn\u2019t drink the tea because the cup was disgusting. It was calcified brown, like a toilet bowl in a manky pub.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum\u2019s cooking was amazing, but the plates had congealed food stuck to them from the previous time they were used</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Still, Lucy enjoyed my company enough to see past the mug and we moved in together after graduation. Apparently I hadn\u2019t improved. \u201cIt\u2019s true that you didn\u2019t see mess,\u201d she says. \u201cYou moved through rooms, only seeing what function things had for you. You\u2019d go in the bathroom, leave the toilet seat up, your towel on the floor.\u201d</p> <p>Is that so bad?</p> <p>\u201cI had to teach you basic things. I couldn\u2019t understand why you were so ill-equipped for life. When I was a kid we took turns washing and drying after dinner. I learned lifelong skills, but also a lot of conversation with my parents and siblings happened around domestic chores.\u201d</p> <p>What did she think the first time she visited my parents\u2019 house? \u201cI loved the jolliness, the friendliness, the colour. But I was taken aback by the dirt. I grew up in suburbia and knew people who kept plastic covers on their sofas. Your mum\u2019s cooking was amazing, but the plates had congealed food stuck to them from the previous time they were used. The wine glasses were greasy.\u201d</p> <p>Like Mum, I could always think of something better than housework to do. In our early years together, I\u2019d tell Lucy to leave it, but she refused and ended up doing it herself. When I mention this to <a href=\"http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/119702/publications\" title=\"\">Alison Pike</a>, a psychology professor at Sussex University, and co-author of a study about household chaos, she says: \u201cIf you don\u2019t care about housework, you\u2019re just not going to be the one who does it. Caring about stuff is gendered. There\u2019s an argument to say that, instead of bellyaching about how men should do more housework, women should just stop doing it.\u201d This is, in effect, what Mum did \u2013 her husbands did no housework and she refused to do much herself. (She did all the cooking; once, when she was unwell, my stepdad made her a cheese sandwich which turned out to be a chunk of parmesan between slices of stale bread.)</p> <p>Circumstance forced me to take responsibility about five years ago, when Lucy started a job involving a long commute at the same time as I began working from home. I got quite good at cooking, which meant keeping the kitchen clean. I began to enjoy doing little things like sweeping crumbs or chopped herbs from the floor after dinner, polishing the hob with French lavender spray, wiping the wall behind the cooker, bleaching the sink after washing up and never leaving anything on the worktops lest we get mice. It\u2019s rewarding, the nightly sense of completion involved in making things gleam, and Lucy says it\u2019s a relief to know she no longer has to do everything. Although part of me can\u2019t help but feel like I\u2019m wiping away a connection to my past with every swish of the sponge.</p> <p>Today, my brother Casper is a chef, so he knows all about keeping kitchens immaculate.

To solve it we hired a cleaner.\u201d</p> <p>When Nici joins the conversation, I sense she feels more strongly. \u201cLittle things I don\u2019t understand,\u201d she says to Casper. \u201cYou open a chocolate bar and throw the wrapper into the sink.

I think she wanted something different for me, but I probably took that on too wholeheartedly. I feel guilty about not passing on any domestic skills, especially now that you have become very domesticated. Your flat is a nest kept perfect. Would you have liked it more if we\u2019d been very tidy when you were growing up?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/21/new-household-rules-ditch-toilet-brush-wash-much-more\">The new household rules: ditch your toilet brush and wash much, much more</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m inclined to say no, but I know my untidiness cost me when I left home, and possibly earlier. At school, teachers said I was bright but disorganised in my written work. I\u2019m a slow learner, which might have something to do with being untidy, and for a long time I felt as though my body was marked with some indelible dirt.</p> <p>It took me decades to learn that my untidiness was taking its toll on me and on others around me. But blaming Mum would be unfair. As Casper says, \u201cShe made up for it in other ways.\u201d Mum created a stimulating, loving home and, like the mess in the house, our family relationships are out in the open \u2013 imperfect, and I think more beautiful for being so. Still, my dad and stepdad should have done a lot more housework. Later, Casper and I should have helped. Perhaps it\u2019s not too late, although I am alarmed to hear that, if the Airbnb plans get off the ground, my stepdad is planning to make breakfast for the guests.

At school, teachers said I was bright but disorganised in my written work. I\u2019m a slow learner, which might have something to do with being untidy, and for a long time I felt as though my body was marked with some indelible dirt. It took me decades to learn that my untidiness was taking its toll on me and on others around me. But blaming Mum would be unfair. As Casper says, \u201cShe made up for it in other ways.\u201d Mum created a stimulating, loving home and, like the mess in the house, our family relationships are out in the open \u2013 imperfect, and I think more beautiful for being so. Still, my dad and stepdad should have done a lot more housework. Later, Casper and I should have helped. Perhaps it\u2019s not too late, although I am alarmed to hear that, if the Airbnb plans get off the ground, my stepdad is planning to make breakfast for the guests. I won\u2019t be reading the reviews. \u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this month, the author and screenwriter Gareth Roberts announced that his story was being removed from a forthcoming <em>Doctor Who</em> anthology. Having been shown Roberts\u2019s past tweets about transgender people, BBC Books said that his views \u201cconflict with our values as a publisher\u201d. At least one of the book\u2019s other contributors, Susie Day, had promised to withdraw from the project if Roberts were included. \u201cI raised my concerns, and said if he was in, I was out,\u201d Day said.</p> <p>A few days before, at the Hay festival, the Irish author John Boyne had described a campaign against his own book, <em>My Brother\u2019s Name </em><em>Is Jessica</em>, about a boy and his trans sister. He was insulted on Twitter for his appearance and his sexuality. (Like Roberts, he is gay but not trans.) Some critics proposed a boycott of Boyne\u2019s novel, which was not withdrawn. Others made veiled threats to his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my job as a reader or a writer to tell anyone what they can or can\u2019t write,\u201d Boyne said. \u201cWe are supposed to use our imaginations, to put ourselves into the minds and the bodies of others.\u201d</p> <p>The campaigns against Roberts and Boyne are not new, or isolated. Since March, I have been sending discreet messages to authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/teen-books\" title=\"\">young adult fiction</a>. I approached 24 people, in several countries, all writing in English. In total, 15 authors replied, of whom 11 agreed to talk to me, either by email or on the phone. Two subsequently withdrew, in one case following professional advice. Two have received death threats and five would only talk if I concealed their identity. This is not what normally happens when you ask writers for an interview.</p> <p>But things aren\u2019t normal in YA right now. In January, a new Chinese-American author, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/01/young-adult-author-cancels-own-novel-after-race-controversy\" title=\"\">Am\u00e9lie Zhao</a>, withdrew her forthcoming fantasy novel <em>Blood Heir</em>, and apologised for the way it handled slavery, which she said was based on the Asian experience, not the American one. Zhao had found an agent during a Twitter pitching event for authors from marginalised groups, but as Ellen Oh, co-founder of the campaign group We Need Diverse Books, explained in a tweet: \u201cYou are not immune to charges of racism just because you are [a person of colour]. Racism is systemic, especially anti-blackness.\u201d Zhao described the reaction to her debut as \u201cdevastating\u201d, and now plans to release an amended version in November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c858e5ea1026e1a8b4e07c94a1a1ad7f20d6cc0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c858e5ea1026e1a8b4e07c94a1a1ad7f20d6cc0e/0_70_500_300/500.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese-American author Am\u00e9lie Zhao withdrew her forthcoming fantasy novel.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Am\u00e9lie Zhao withdrew her forthcoming fantasy novel about slavery.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another of Zhao\u2019s critics was Kosoko Jackson, whose own debut novel <em>A Place for Wolves</em>, about a romance between two teenage boys during the Kosovo war, was scheduled for release in March. Jackson is black and gay, and a professional sensitivity reader, which means he reads books before publication and offers advice on how they handle matters of identity. Yet on 22 February, he too was accused of insensitivity, for allegedly minimising the suffering of Albanian Muslims. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disgusted in my life,\u201d said the first review to make this point, on the reading community website Goodreads.com. On 25 February, comments below the review began to discuss sending an open letter to Jackson\u2019s publisher. On 28 February, he posted a note apologising to \u201cthose who I hurt with my words\u201d and withdrew the book. In April, the British YA author Zoe Marriott was widely accused of cultural appropriation for writing a Chinese-inspired fantasy novel called <em>The Hand, the Eye and the Heart</em>.</p> <p>These are just the latest battles in a war that seems to be escalating over who should control the way that people from marginalised communities appear in YA fiction. In August 2016, the Mexican-American author EE Charlton-Trujillo\u2019s verse novel <em>When We Was Fierce</em> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/16/delays-ya-row-over-invented-black-vernacular-when-we-was-fierce\" title=\"\">was delayed</a> after several bloggers criticised its attempt to capture the voice of a black teenager. It has still not been published, and is not mentioned on Charlton-Trujillo\u2019s website. In the months that followed, three speculative fiction novels, <em>The Black Witch</em> by Laurie Forest, <em>American Heart</em> by Laura Moriarty and <em>The Continent</em> by Keira Drake, attracted protests for their allegedly racist content. Forest published regardless, and with great success, despite a campaign of one-star reviews and emails to her publisher. Moriarty published, too, although Kirkus magazine, which had defended <em>The Black Witch</em>, downgraded and revised its review of <em>American Heart</em>, because it said the article \u201cfell short of meeting our standards for clarity and sensitivity\u201d. Drake, however, was convinced by her critics, 455 of whom signed a petition demanding that <em>The Continent</em>, \u201ca racist garbage fire\u201d according to one fellow author, be delayed to allow \u201cadditional editorial focus\u201d. A substantially revised version appeared in March 2018.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've heard of publishers cancelling books and asking their authors to apologise, fearing the consequences if they didn\u2019t</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The YA community is a much tighter group than the scattered loners who write adult fiction. \u201cYoung adult\u201d means books suitable for readers aged 12 to 18, and the grownups who write them exhibit en masse the same idealism and energy, the defiance and conformity, and the love of social media for which teenagers are famous. Spend time weaving through the Twitter feeds of YA bloggers and authors and you\u2019ll find a supportive atmosphere for struggling writers, along with a widespread belief that the novels they produce should be good in all ways, moral and artistic. In particular, every author I\u2019ve spoken to agrees that marginalised people must be represented in books more accurately and often than in the past. It is something they have more reason to care about than most, since young people on average are more liberal and less white than the general population in both the US and the UK. It is also natural to write more cautiously when about half the people reading will be children.</p> <p>The YA category is still a teenager itself, with origins in the Harry Potter years at the beginning of the century. Its first big identity discussion took place in 2012, when the film of <em>The Hunger Games</em> surprised some loyal but inattentive readers with the news that two of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/28/hunger-games-cast-racist-imagined\" title=\"\">main characters were black</a>. In May 2014, a new fan convention in New York called BookCon announced an all-male, all-white panel for its Blockbuster Reads event, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/may/01/we-need-diverse-books-campaign-children\" title=\"\">We Need Diverse Books</a> grew out of the protests that followed. In September 2015, Corinne Duyvis, a Dutch YA author, proposed the Twitter label #ownvoices to promote books in which \u201cthe protagonist and author share a marginalised identity\u201d. It has since become a kind of quality assurance mark for many campaigners, since it means that a book will help diversify both the characters and authors in YA fiction, while guaranteeing that the author knows what life with the character\u2019s identity is like. In autumn 2015, Kirkus began a policy of noting the skin colour of major characters in children\u2019s and YA books, and assigning own-voices reviewers to them. Kirkus also started to provide what it called \u201csensitivity training\u201d to its reviewers. The employment of sensitivity readers became routine in US YA publishing at around the same time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8ae8656f11a8da7be57df3a6b83ec2f95f1ae7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8ae8656f11a8da7be57df3a6b83ec2f95f1ae7d/0_355_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Irish author John Boyne had described a campaign against his book about a boy and his trans sister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Boyne faced criticism of his book <em>My Brother\u2019s Name Is Jessica.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many of the battles around YA books display the worst features of what is sometimes called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/25/cancel-bret-easton-ellis-millennials-culture\" title=\"\">cancel culture</a>\u201d. Tweets condemning anyone who even reads an accused book have been shared widely. I have heard about publishers cancelling or altering books, and asking authors to issue apologies, not because either of them believed they ought to apologise, but because they feared the consequences if they didn\u2019t. Some authors feel that it is risky even to talk in public about this subject. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially really serious,\u201d says someone I\u2019ll call Alex. \u201cYou could get absolutely mobbed.\u201d So I can\u2019t use your real name? \u201cI would be too nervous to say that with my name to it.\u201d None of the big three UK publishing groups, Penguin Random House, HarperCollins or Hachette, was available for comment.</p> <p>Another author I will call<strong> </strong>Chris is white, queer and disabled. Chris has generally found the YA community friendly and supportive during a career spanning several books, but something changed when they announced plans for a novel about a character from another culture. Later, Chris would discover that an angry post about the book had appeared anonymously on Tumblr, directing others to their website. At the time, Chris only knew that their blog and email were being flooded with up to 100 abusive messages a day.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wars may even spread \u2013 there have been two campaigns against adult novels on the basis of identity this year</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThese ranged from people telling me that \u2026 I was a sick pervert for tainting [their] story with my corrupt, westernised ideas,\u201d Chris says, \u201cto people saying [I] had no right to appropriate [their] experiences for [my] own benefit and I must immediately stop work. Some emails and comments consisted of just four-letter words.\u201d There were threats of beatings and sexual assault. One message made the threat of a group \u201ccoming to my house in the middle of the night, and breaking in so that they could give me a lethal overdose\u201d. Some messages came through Goodreads, although Chris does not know if they were linked to the main YA community. The \u201cvast majority\u201d, and all of the most violent threats, \u201ccame from an ideology that I would identify as left\u201d, Chris says, and every message made the same demand. \u201cStop writing this. Don\u2019t write this. You can\u2019t write this. You\u2019re not allowed \u2026 \u201d</p> <p>Chris now realises that it would have been best to call the police. In fact, they told no one. The messages continued for about a year, during which time Chris stopped sleeping, found it hard to write, and became increasingly depressed. At last, from a mixture of financial necessity and the feeling that the punishment was already happening, Chris finished the book, which has since been published. The original Tumblr post remains online.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8baaf1081cc3e82e33faceece1187e4b65a2ba90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8baaf1081cc3e82e33faceece1187e4b65a2ba90/0_0_1650_2550/647.jpg\" alt=\"They Called Me Wyatt\" width=\"647\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For publishers, supporting a book accused of racism could seriously harm their reputation, yet the price of withdrawing one could be enormous. \u201cIt is a topic that is discussed on a daily basis in private groups on Facebook,\u201d says an author I will call Paris, who has twice been nominated for the Carnegie medal. \u201cThere is a huge demand for books to be more sensitive to minority groups, but there is also a concern that this censorship, pre-publication, is the wrong way to go about it.\u201d In Paris\u2019s case, after months of debate, an entire series was withdrawn by the publisher. \u201cThe books were literally going to print that morning,\u201d Paris remembers. \u201cThey ended up paying for the entire series, so I got all my advances and it never got published \u2026 It was mind-boggling. Just bizarre.\u201d</p> <p>Does Paris know why they pulled it? \u201cBecause the publisher was scared of Twitter. They admitted this, because there are things like a racist character in the book. They were worried that people would say, \u2018This has got a racist character. The author must be racist.\u2019\u201d The publisher was certain that the books were fine, Paris says, but felt it could not risk an accusation of racism. \u201cThey are paranoid, and [the] sales [department] were second-guessing everything. They went through [the books] and went, \u2018That could be misconstrued as offensive. That could be offensive. That could be offensive \u2026\u2019\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> <p>The idea that sensitivity is too subjective to understand, let alone enforce, frustrates many of those who campaign for it in the YA community. Rather than being a righteous mob trying to silence other opinions, they regard themselves as simple fact-checkers, providing a service that is welcomed by authors. \u201cI see sensitivity reads as a form of peer review,\u201d says one, who asked not to be identified. \u201cThere are some things as a white, cis, straight person that I may not notice or even consider. I recall a huge moment for me was reading about black ballerinas dyeing their pointe shoes to match their skin. It\u2019s such a small thing, but I never had to think about that when I did ballet; the shoes always matched my skin.\u201d</p> <p>Heidi Heilig runs a YA Facebook group with more than 1,700 members. She says that the community is much more moderate and reasonable than many outsiders have been led to believe. \u201cThere is a sect of people who say, \u2018Any criticism is censorship,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere are people who say, \u2018You can only write a character from a certain race if you are of that certain race.\u2019 But a lot of the conversation falls somewhere in the middle.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dabb67b84481eee0e36f6af2f4a1dc063e5496d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dabb67b84481eee0e36f6af2f4a1dc063e5496d/0_28_788_473/500.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The way that things have played out this year doesn\u2019t sit comfortably for me\u2019 \u2026 author Mary Watson.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The way that things have played out this year doesn\u2019t sit comfortably for me\u2019 \u2026 author Mary Watson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Far from being afraid of criticism, Heilig says that many writers in her group are eager for feedback on identity matters, and many writers from marginalised groups are happy to provide it without accusing anyone of anything. None of this, of course, is seen by the outside world. \u201cWe care about our peers,\u201d Heilig says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to drag people. That is the worst and last option. The first thing to do is try to help.\u201d Meanwhile, many mildly racist books are still published without controversy, she believes, and some of the controversy we see has an important but hidden private context. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the fears you\u2019re talking about are borne out by reality. People make this out to be so hard, but honestly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult. What we\u2019re looking for is good writing, so you either know what the tropes are and subvert them, or break the tropes entirely. I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s such a push to do the same old thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c603db272421844d0a722eccde5367f117ca955f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c603db272421844d0a722eccde5367f117ca955f/0_0_1015_1519/668.jpg\" alt=\"When We Was Fierce\" width=\"668\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Ellen Oh has been reluctant to talk publicly since her tweets about <em>Blood Heir</em>, for which she received death threats against herself and her family. She reported the worst cases to the police, and in the end deleted her social media accounts. Criticism is healthy, Oh believes, but she feels that outsiders have made things needlessly unpleasant. \u201cI wish we did not have these mob reactions,\u201d she says. \u201cThe YA community used to be a safe place where bloggers and writers could communicate and share book news. It\u2019s become so different \u2026 There are extremes on both sides, and it is hard to find the truth among all the vitriol.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/24/wren-hunt-mary-watson-magic-review-ireland\" title=\"\">Mary Watson</a>, a mixed-race author who grew up under apartheid in South Africa and now lives in Ireland, agrees. \u201cI think there have been many careless and even damaging representations of people of colour in books,\u201d she says, \u201cand as a reader I\u2019ve experienced it throughout my life. Sometimes it\u2019s just eye-rolling, sometimes it makes you want to shut the book in exasperation, so I understand that there\u2019s a lot of anger about how people are represented. I absolutely get that. But the way that things have played out this year doesn\u2019t sit comfortably for me \u2026 I absolutely agree that sloppy representation should be spoken out against, but I think this should happen in ways that encourage constructive dialogue rather than cancellation.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/apr/06/sophia-bennett-love-song-interview\" title=\"\">Sophia Bennett</a>, a British author, welcomes many of the changes in YA over the past five years, but sees a clear line that critics should not cross. \u201cOne thing that saddens me about the way that the argument is polarised on social media is how many people comment negatively, particularly, on books that they haven\u2019t read,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that is an unhealthy attitude for a readership to have. They don\u2019t want to make up their own minds based on their own experience.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> <p>There are other reasons, beyond the page, why the YA community might be upset right now. According to research by Melanie Ramdarshan Bold at University College London, after a period of rapid growth in the early 2000s, the number of YA books being published in the UK peaked in 2012, since when it has declined rapidly. In 2016, the latest year in the study, just 167 different YA authors were published in the UK, less than half the number of 2012 and fewer than in any year since 2006, when the dataset begins. Overall, sales of young adult fiction fell in the US last year, and in February the Bookseller revealed a very steep drop in UK sales, which are now at their lowest point for 11 years. There are many theories to explain this, including the idea that YA has become overloaded with social justice themes \u2013 although this was hardly a problem for <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/08/the-hate-u-give-angie-thomas-review-alex-wheatle\" title=\"\">The Hate U Give</a></em>, a huge blockbuster by Angie Thomas, which concerns the shooting of a black teenager by a white police officer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"fea109f7f563fc145b936fb96d3b4cabf07195e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fea109f7f563fc145b936fb96d3b4cabf07195e8/0_0_457_696/328.jpg\" alt=\"The Blood Heir\" width=\"328\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The YA wars may die out in the months ahead, as people grow weary of the arguments. Or the conflict may appear to die out, if timid publishers purge anything that they can imagine being questioned. The wars may even spread. There have been two pre\u2011publication campaigns against adult novels on the basis of identity so far this year. A petition demanded the withdrawal of <em>The Cape Doctor</em> by EJ Levy because of the way it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/18/new-novel-about-dr-james-barry-sparks-row-over-victorians-gender-identity\" title=\"\">handles the gender</a> of its central character. In May, <em>They Called Me Wyatt</em> was cancelled after its author Natasha Tynes tweeted a photograph of a black subway worker eating, against the rules, on a Washington DC train. Tynes was widely accused of racism. At the time of writing, on Goodreads, her book has received 1,970 one-star reviews. She is now suing her publisher.</p> <p>It may not be realistic to hope for restraint on social media, but it is clearly what\u2019s required. If authors are only human and make mistakes that need to be corrected, then critics are also human, and must be ready to admit some mistakes of their own. In January, Kosoko Jackson was an authority on negative tropes in fiction. In February, he was a perpetrator, as unreliable as everybody else. Heilig herself praised <em>A Place for Wolves</em> on Goodreads, then later apologised for being \u201cflippant and disrespectful\u201d. Still, correction hurts, so it is always tempting to dismiss the \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d or the \u201carrogant racists\u201d on the other side. Ironically, it can even happen when writers argue over how to avoid stereotypes. Nothing is more normal than being wrong.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2019 to correct the name of John Boyne\u2019s book <em>My Brother\u2019s Name Is Jessica.</em></p> <p><strong> </strong></p>",

At least one of the book\u2019s other contributors, Susie Day, had promised to withdraw from the project if Roberts were included. \u201cI raised my concerns, and said if he was in, I was out,\u201d Day said. A few days before, at the Hay festival, the Irish author John Boyne had described a campaign against his own book, My Brother\u2019s Name Is Jessica, about a boy and his trans sister. He was insulted on Twitter for his appearance and his sexuality. (Like Roberts, he is gay but not trans.) Some critics proposed a boycott of Boyne\u2019s novel, which was not withdrawn. Others made veiled threats to his safety. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it\u2019s my job as a reader or a writer to tell anyone what they can or can\u2019t write,\u201d Boyne said. \u201cWe are supposed to use our imaginations, to put ourselves into the minds and the bodies of others.\u201d The campaigns against Roberts and Boyne are not new, or isolated. Since March, I have been sending discreet messages to authors of young adult fiction. I approached 24 people, in several countries, all writing in English. In total, 15 authors replied, of whom 11 agreed to talk to me, either by email or on the phone. Two subsequently withdrew, in one case following professional advice. Two have received death threats and five would only talk if I concealed their identity. This is not what normally happens when you ask writers for an interview. But things aren\u2019t normal in YA right now. In January, a new Chinese-American author, Am\u00e9lie Zhao, withdrew her forthcoming fantasy novel Blood Heir, and apologised for the way it handled slavery, which she said was based on the Asian experience, not the American one. Zhao had found an agent during a Twitter pitching event for authors from marginalised groups, but as Ellen Oh, co-founder of the campaign group We Need Diverse Books, explained in a tweet: \u201cYou are not immune to charges of racism just because you are [a person of colour]. Racism is systemic, especially anti-blackness.\u201d Zhao described the reaction to her debut as \u201cdevastating\u201d, and now plans to release an amended version in November. Another of Zhao\u2019s critics was Kosoko Jackson, whose own debut novel A Place for Wolves, about a romance between two teenage boys during the Kosovo war, was scheduled for release in March. Jackson is black and gay, and a professional sensitivity reader, which means he reads books before publication and offers advice on how they handle matters of identity. Yet on 22 February, he too was accused of insensitivity, for allegedly minimising the suffering of Albanian Muslims. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so disgusted in my life,\u201d said the first review to make this point, on the reading community website Goodreads.com. On 25 February, comments below the review began to discuss sending an open letter to Jackson\u2019s publisher. On 28 February, he posted a note apologising to \u201cthose who I hurt with my words\u201d and withdrew the book. In April, the British YA author Zoe Marriott was widely accused of cultural appropriation for writing a Chinese-inspired fantasy novel called The Hand, the Eye and the Heart. These are just the latest battles in a war that seems to be escalating over who should control the way that people from marginalised communities appear in YA fiction. In August 2016, the Mexican-American author EE Charlton-Trujillo\u2019s verse novel When We Was Fierce was delayed after several bloggers criticised its attempt to capture the voice of a black teenager. It has still not been published, and is not mentioned on Charlton-Trujillo\u2019s website. In the months that followed, three speculative fiction novels, The Black Witch by Laurie Forest, American Heart by Laura Moriarty and The Continent by Keira Drake, attracted protests for their allegedly racist content. Forest published regardless, and with great success, despite a campaign of one-star reviews and emails to her publisher. Moriarty published, too, although Kirkus magazine, which had defended The Black Witch, downgraded and revised its review of American Heart, because it said the article \u201cfell short of meeting our standards for clarity and sensitivity\u201d. Drake, however, was convinced by her critics, 455 of whom signed a petition demanding that The Continent, \u201ca racist garbage fire\u201d according to one fellow author, be delayed to allow \u201cadditional editorial focus\u201d. A substantially revised version appeared in March 2018. The YA community is a much tighter group than the scattered loners who write adult fiction. \u201cYoung adult\u201d means books suitable for readers aged 12 to 18, and the grownups who write them exhibit en masse the same idealism and energy, the defiance and conformity, and the love of social media for which teenagers are famous. Spend time weaving through the Twitter feeds of YA bloggers and authors and you\u2019ll find a supportive atmosphere for struggling writers, along with a widespread belief that the novels they produce should be good in all ways, moral and artistic. In particular, every author I\u2019ve spoken to agrees that marginalised people must be represented in books more accurately and often than in the past. It is something they have more reason to care about than most, since young people on average are more liberal and less white than the general population in both the US and the UK. It is also natural to write more cautiously when about half the people reading will be children. The YA category is still a teenager itself, with origins in the Harry Potter years at the beginning of the century. Its first big identity discussion took place in 2012, when the film of The Hunger Games surprised some loyal but inattentive readers with the news that two of the main characters were black. In May 2014, a new fan convention in New York called BookCon announced an all-male, all-white panel for its Blockbuster Reads event, and We Need Diverse Books grew out of the protests that followed. In September 2015, Corinne Duyvis, a Dutch YA author, proposed the Twitter label #ownvoices to promote books in which \u201cthe protagonist and author share a marginalised identity\u201d. It has since become a kind of quality assurance mark for many campaigners, since it means that a book will help diversify both the characters and authors in YA fiction, while guaranteeing that the author knows what life with the character\u2019s identity is like. In autumn 2015, Kirkus began a policy of noting the skin colour of major characters in children\u2019s and YA books, and assigning own-voices reviewers to them. Kirkus also started to provide what it called \u201csensitivity training\u201d to its reviewers. The employment of sensitivity readers became routine in US YA publishing at around the same time. Many of the battles around YA books display the worst features of what is sometimes called \u201ccancel culture\u201d. Tweets condemning anyone who even reads an accused book have been shared widely. I have heard about publishers cancelling or altering books, and asking authors to issue apologies, not because either of them believed they ought to apologise, but because they feared the consequences if they didn\u2019t. Some authors feel that it is risky even to talk in public about this subject. \u201cIt\u2019s potentially really serious,\u201d says someone I\u2019ll call Alex. \u201cYou could get absolutely mobbed.\u201d So I can\u2019t use your real name? \u201cI would be too nervous to say that with my name to it.\u201d None of the big three UK publishing groups, Penguin Random House, HarperCollins or Hachette, was available for comment. Another author I will call Chris is white, queer and disabled. Chris has generally found the YA community friendly and supportive during a career spanning several books, but something changed when they announced plans for a novel about a character from another culture. Later, Chris would discover that an angry post about the book had appeared anonymously on Tumblr, directing others to their website. At the time, Chris only knew that their blog and email were being flooded with up to 100 abusive messages a day. \u201cThese ranged from people telling me that \u2026 I was a sick pervert for tainting [their] story with my corrupt, westernised ideas,\u201d Chris says, \u201cto people saying [I] had no right to appropriate [their] experiences for [my] own benefit and I must immediately stop work. Some emails and comments consisted of just four-letter words.\u201d There were threats of beatings and sexual assault. One message made the threat of a group \u201ccoming to my house in the middle of the night, and breaking in so that they could give me a lethal overdose\u201d. Some messages came through Goodreads, although Chris does not know if they were linked to the main YA community. The \u201cvast majority\u201d, and all of the most violent threats, \u201ccame from an ideology that I would identify as left\u201d, Chris says, and every message made the same demand. \u201cStop writing this. Don\u2019t write this. You can\u2019t write this. You\u2019re not allowed \u2026 \u201d Chris now realises that it would have been best to call the police. In fact, they told no one. The messages continued for about a year, during which time Chris stopped sleeping, found it hard to write, and became increasingly depressed. At last, from a mixture of financial necessity and the feeling that the punishment was already happening, Chris finished the book, which has since been published. The original Tumblr post remains online. For publishers, supporting a book accused of racism could seriously harm their reputation, yet the price of withdrawing one could be enormous. \u201cIt is a topic that is discussed on a daily basis in private groups on Facebook,\u201d says an author I will call Paris, who has twice been nominated for the Carnegie medal. \u201cThere is a huge demand for books to be more sensitive to minority groups, but there is also a concern that this censorship, pre-publication, is the wrong way to go about it.\u201d In Paris\u2019s case, after months of debate, an entire series was withdrawn by the publisher. \u201cThe books were literally going to print that morning,\u201d Paris remembers. \u201cThey ended up paying for the entire series, so I got all my advances and it never got published \u2026 It was mind-boggling. Just bizarre.\u201d Does Paris know why they pulled it? \u201cBecause the publisher was scared of Twitter. They admitted this, because there are things like a racist character in the book. They were worried that people would say, \u2018This has got a racist character. The author must be racist.\u2019\u201d The publisher was certain that the books were fine, Paris says, but felt it could not risk an accusation of racism. \u201cThey are paranoid, and [the] sales [department] were second-guessing everything. They went through [the books] and went, \u2018That could be misconstrued as offensive. That could be offensive. That could be offensive \u2026\u2019\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 The idea that sensitivity is too subjective to understand, let alone enforce, frustrates many of those who campaign for it in the YA community. Rather than being a righteous mob trying to silence other opinions, they regard themselves as simple fact-checkers, providing a service that is welcomed by authors. \u201cI see sensitivity reads as a form of peer review,\u201d says one, who asked not to be identified. \u201cThere are some things as a white, cis, straight person that I may not notice or even consider. I recall a huge moment for me was reading about black ballerinas dyeing their pointe shoes to match their skin. It\u2019s such a small thing, but I never had to think about that when I did ballet; the shoes always matched my skin.\u201d Heidi Heilig runs a YA Facebook group with more than 1,700 members. She says that the community is much more moderate and reasonable than many outsiders have been led to believe. \u201cThere is a sect of people who say, \u2018Any criticism is censorship,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere are people who say, \u2018You can only write a character from a certain race if you are of that certain race.\u2019 But a lot of the conversation falls somewhere in the middle.\u201d Far from being afraid of criticism, Heilig says that many writers in her group are eager for feedback on identity matters, and many writers from marginalised groups are happy to provide it without accusing anyone of anything. None of this, of course, is seen by the outside world. \u201cWe care about our peers,\u201d Heilig says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to drag people. That is the worst and last option. The first thing to do is try to help.\u201d Meanwhile, many mildly racist books are still published without controversy, she believes, and some of the controversy we see has an important but hidden private context. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the fears you\u2019re talking about are borne out by reality. People make this out to be so hard, but honestly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that difficult. What we\u2019re looking for is good writing, so you either know what the tropes are and subvert them, or break the tropes entirely. I don\u2019t understand why there\u2019s such a push to do the same old thing.\u201d Ellen Oh has been reluctant to talk publicly since her tweets about Blood Heir, for which she received death threats against herself and her family. She reported the worst cases to the police, and in the end deleted her social media accounts. Criticism is healthy, Oh believes, but she feels that outsiders have made things needlessly unpleasant. \u201cI wish we did not have these mob reactions,\u201d she says. \u201cThe YA community used to be a safe place where bloggers and writers could communicate and share book news. It\u2019s become so different \u2026 There are extremes on both sides, and it is hard to find the truth among all the vitriol.\u201d Mary Watson, a mixed-race author who grew up under apartheid in South Africa and now lives in Ireland, agrees. \u201cI think there have been many careless and even damaging representations of people of colour in books,\u201d she says, \u201cand as a reader I\u2019ve experienced it throughout my life. Sometimes it\u2019s just eye-rolling, sometimes it makes you want to shut the book in exasperation, so I understand that there\u2019s a lot of anger about how people are represented. I absolutely get that. But the way that things have played out this year doesn\u2019t sit comfortably for me \u2026 I absolutely agree that sloppy representation should be spoken out against, but I think this should happen in ways that encourage constructive dialogue rather than cancellation.\u201d Sophia Bennett, a British author, welcomes many of the changes in YA over the past five years, but sees a clear line that critics should not cross. \u201cOne thing that saddens me about the way that the argument is polarised on social media is how many people comment negatively, particularly, on books that they haven\u2019t read,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that is an unhealthy attitude for a readership to have. They don\u2019t want to make up their own minds based on their own experience.\u201d \u2022\u2022\u2022 There are other reasons, beyond the page, why the YA community might be upset right now. According to research by Melanie Ramdarshan Bold at University College London, after a period of rapid growth in the early 2000s, the number of YA books being published in the UK peaked in 2012, since when it has declined rapidly. In 2016, the latest year in the study, just 167 different YA authors were published in the UK, less than half the number of 2012 and fewer than in any year since 2006, when the dataset begins. Overall, sales of young adult fiction fell in the US last year, and in February the Bookseller revealed a very steep drop in UK sales, which are now at their lowest point for 11 years. There are many theories to explain this, including the idea that YA has become overloaded with social justice themes \u2013 although this was hardly a problem for The Hate U Give, a huge blockbuster by Angie Thomas, which concerns the shooting of a black teenager by a white police officer. The YA wars may die out in the months ahead, as people grow weary of the arguments. Or the conflict may appear to die out, if timid publishers purge anything that they can imagine being questioned. The wars may even spread. There have been two pre\u2011publication campaigns against adult novels on the basis of identity so far this year. A petition demanded the withdrawal of The Cape Doctor by EJ Levy because of the way it handles the gender of its central character. In May, They Called Me Wyatt was cancelled after its author Natasha Tynes tweeted a photograph of a black subway worker eating, against the rules, on a Washington DC train. Tynes was widely accused of racism. At the time of writing, on Goodreads, her book has received 1,970 one-star reviews. She is now suing her publisher. It may not be realistic to hope for restraint on social media, but it is clearly what\u2019s required. If authors are only human and make mistakes that need to be corrected, then critics are also human, and must be ready to admit some mistakes of their own. In January, Kosoko Jackson was an authority on negative tropes in fiction. In February, he was a perpetrator, as unreliable as everybody else. Heilig herself praised A Place for Wolves on Goodreads, then later apologised for being \u201cflippant and disrespectful\u201d. Still, correction hurts, so it is always tempting to dismiss the \u201csocial justice warriors\u201d or the \u201carrogant racists\u201d on the other side. Ironically, it can even happen when writers argue over how to avoid stereotypes. Nothing is more normal than being wrong. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 June 2019 to correct the name of John Boyne\u2019s book My Brother\u2019s Name Is Jessica.",

No other team has won more World Cups and Olympic gold medals than the US, who have been ranked No 1 in the world since lifting the Women\u2019s World Cup trophy in 2015.

It\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a frontrunner, just as is the case for Patriots and the others.</p> <p>\u201cWe always have a target on our backs, but why wouldn\u2019t you want that?\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThe No 1 team in the world, we won the last World Cup and we\u2019re trying win this World Cup again. It\u2019s great when there\u2019s a target on your back, when people are talking about you \u2013 you\u2019re obviously doing something right.\u201d</p> <p>The USA\u2019s record-setting demolition of Thailand offered fodder for a match-up that on paper figured to be a run-of-the-mill US win. Debates broke out on social media and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/11/usa-thailand-uswnt-womens-world-cup-soccer-match-report\">in comments sections</a> all over the internet as to whether the Americans should\u2019ve kept celebrating after, say, the sixth goal they scored in the rout.</p> <p>But the players probably haven\u2019t seen much of the reaction, if any of it, other than the questions they\u2019ve faced from the press corps following the match, of course.</p> <p>During events like the World Cup, the players live inside what they refer to as their \u201cbubble\u201d. They stay off social media, don\u2019t read the news, and interactions with the press come in tightly controlled situations. The players focus on soccer, they focus on their relationships with each other, and they let everything else fade into the background.</p> <p>So when asked about Hope Solo\u2019s <a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/hope-solo-jill-ellis-comments-uswnt-165515563.html\">controversial comments last week</a> calling Jill Ellis a poor leader, the players told the reporter they hadn\u2019t seen what she said and couldn\u2019t comment. Again, when asked about the hand-wringing about the goal celebrations against Thailand, a similar answer followed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we as a team are super involved in watching or reading a lot of media about ourselves, to be honest,\u201d midfielder Samantha Mewis said when asked about the criticism of the team\u2019s celebrations. \u201cWe had heard there were some things going on, but I think we\u2019re just trying to focus on the next game against Chile.\u201d</p> <p>Younger players like attackers Mallory Pugh and Rose Lavelle, who are competing in their first World Cup, have opted to remove social media from their devices altogether.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve actually been deleting social media every camp since last year because I knew it was something that, if I didn\u2019t start to wean off it, it could negatively affect me in this tournament,\u201d Lavelle said. \u201cNo offense to you guys, you\u2019re all great. I\u2019m really happy I did that because I feel like I can stay more focused and be more present with the team.\u201d</p> <p>For veterans like Lloyd, it\u2019s a bit less of a bunker mentality.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a lot older. I don\u2019t really care what people think,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cA lot of these people think that they\u2019re experts and they\u2019re not \u2013 no disrespect.\u201d</p> <p>She does have her agent and publicist post on her behalf during the World Cup, but she says she\u2019s the one who noticed the tweet from Thailand\u2019s goalkeeper, Sukanya Chor Charoenying, thanking Lloyd for kind words after the match.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CarliLloyd/status/1139096218590687232\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">All you can do is give it your best each and every day.

But it\u2019s clearly something that works for them. Back in 2015, the USWNT was hit with plenty of flak for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/22/usa-must-find-their-killer-instinct-against-colombia-at-womens-world-cup\">a lackluster start to the World Cup</a>, and even former team legend Michelle Akers had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2015/06/24/former-uswnt-star-michelle-akers-puts-u-s-coach-jill-ellis-on-blast/?utm_term=.b44a37b3e09c\">publicly criticized</a> Ellis.</p> <p>But Ellis and the players insisted they weren\u2019t paying attention. The term \u201cbubble\u201d was used over and over again. Ultimately, the US lifted the trophy.</p> <p>So what is it about the bubble that works? It\u2019s not so much about us on the outside: it\u2019s about the players connecting with each other.</p> <p>\u201cThe best way to come together as a group is to create that bubble and eliminate all the outside noise,\u201d goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher said last week. \u201cWe have all those expectations for ourselves. We don\u2019t need any outside things. We have high standards. We want to win.</p> <p>\u201cThe more that we can bond and come together as a group, you\u2019ll be able to see that on the field. I think all that translates into performances. You can see the teams that are cohesive and you can see the teams that aren\u2019t, and we want to be one of those cohesive teams.\u201d</p> <p>The most charitable view of the USWNT\u2019s exuberant goal celebrations against an overmatched Thai team is along those things: that the players wanted to celebrate together and enjoy the moment with one another rather than throw their dominance in the faces of the Thai team.</p> <p>Not everyone will see it that way, of course. Whether it\u2019s the USWNT, the Patriots or the others, some fans will be irked by whatever the Americans do. That\u2019s fine with the USWNT: they\u2019re used to it.</p>",

      "bodyText": "They are the teams that neutrals love to root against: the New England Patriots, the Golden State Warriors, Manchester United and \u2026 the US women\u2019s national team? \u201cI was actually just talking about this 20 minutes ago at breakfast,\u201d striker Carli Lloyd told the Guardian Friday morning. \u201cI\u2019m like, you know, everybody just hates the Patriots \u2013 and I\u2019m an Eagles fan all my life \u2013 but you\u2019ve got to respect what the Patriots have done. You\u2019ve got to respect what the Golden State Warriors have done.\u201d The parallels between the USWNT and the other sports dynasties that neutrals love to hate are obvious. No other team has won more World Cups and Olympic gold medals than the US, who have been ranked No 1 in the world since lifting the Women\u2019s World Cup trophy in 2015. And after thumping Thailand 13-0 on Tuesday without showing mercy \u2013 neither in the volume of goals nor in the jubilant celebrations \u2013 the Americans only offered more fuel for the unaffiliated to root against. That doesn\u2019t worry USWNT players, though. It\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re a frontrunner, just as is the case for Patriots and the others. \u201cWe always have a target on our backs, but why wouldn\u2019t you want that?\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cThe No 1 team in the world, we won the last World Cup and we\u2019re trying win this World Cup again. It\u2019s great when there\u2019s a target on your back, when people are talking about you \u2013 you\u2019re obviously doing something right.\u201d The USA\u2019s record-setting demolition of Thailand offered fodder for a match-up that on paper figured to be a run-of-the-mill US win. Debates broke out on social media and in comments sections all over the internet as to whether the Americans should\u2019ve kept celebrating after, say, the sixth goal they scored in the rout. But the players probably haven\u2019t seen much of the reaction, if any of it, other than the questions they\u2019ve faced from the press corps following the match, of course. During events like the World Cup, the players live inside what they refer to as their \u201cbubble\u201d. They stay off social media, don\u2019t read the news, and interactions with the press come in tightly controlled situations. The players focus on soccer, they focus on their relationships with each other, and they let everything else fade into the background. So when asked about Hope Solo\u2019s controversial comments last week calling Jill Ellis a poor leader, the players told the reporter they hadn\u2019t seen what she said and couldn\u2019t comment. Again, when asked about the hand-wringing about the goal celebrations against Thailand, a similar answer followed. \u201cI don\u2019t think we as a team are super involved in watching or reading a lot of media about ourselves, to be honest,\u201d midfielder Samantha Mewis said when asked about the criticism of the team\u2019s celebrations. \u201cWe had heard there were some things going on, but I think we\u2019re just trying to focus on the next game against Chile.\u201d Younger players like attackers Mallory Pugh and Rose Lavelle, who are competing in their first World Cup, have opted to remove social media from their devices altogether. \u201cI\u2019ve actually been deleting social media every camp since last year because I knew it was something that, if I didn\u2019t start to wean off it, it could negatively affect me in this tournament,\u201d Lavelle said. \u201cNo offense to you guys, you\u2019re all great. I\u2019m really happy I did that because I feel like I can stay more focused and be more present with the team.\u201d For veterans like Lloyd, it\u2019s a bit less of a bunker mentality. \u201cI\u2019m a lot older. I don\u2019t really care what people think,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cA lot of these people think that they\u2019re experts and they\u2019re not \u2013 no disrespect.\u201d She does have her agent and publicist post on her behalf during the World Cup, but she says she\u2019s the one who noticed the tweet from Thailand\u2019s goalkeeper, Sukanya Chor Charoenying, thanking Lloyd for kind words after the match. \u201cI\u2019m happy I saw that,\u201d Lloyd said. \u201cIf I was blacked out and not on Twitter, it would\u2019ve gone unnoticed.\u201d The so-called \u201cbubble\u201d may offer an easy out for the players throughout the World Cup: anytime they are asked about a controversy, they can claim ignorance on the topic. But it\u2019s clearly something that works for them. Back in 2015, the USWNT was hit with plenty of flak for a lackluster start to the World Cup, and even former team legend Michelle Akers had publicly criticized Ellis. But Ellis and the players insisted they weren\u2019t paying attention. The term \u201cbubble\u201d was used over and over again. Ultimately, the US lifted the trophy. So what is it about the bubble that works? It\u2019s not so much about us on the outside: it\u2019s about the players connecting with each other. \u201cThe best way to come together as a group is to create that bubble and eliminate all the outside noise,\u201d goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher said last week. \u201cWe have all those expectations for ourselves. We don\u2019t need any outside things. We have high standards. We want to win. \u201cThe more that we can bond and come together as a group, you\u2019ll be able to see that on the field. I think all that translates into performances. You can see the teams that are cohesive and you can see the teams that aren\u2019t, and we want to be one of those cohesive teams.\u201d The most charitable view of the USWNT\u2019s exuberant goal celebrations against an overmatched Thai team is along those things: that the players wanted to celebrate together and enjoy the moment with one another rather than throw their dominance in the faces of the Thai team. Not everyone will see it that way, of course. Whether it\u2019s the USWNT, the Patriots or the others, some fans will be irked by whatever the Americans do. That\u2019s fine with the USWNT: they\u2019re used to it.",

      "body": "<p>The first typewriter Michael Gustafson fell in love with was a 1930s Smith Corona. As a child he saw it on his grandfather\u2019s writing desk and later, when he was a struggling writer, his grandmother gave it to him. \u201cClick-clacking\u201d on the old typewriter \u201cstirred something\u201d in him: not only did he feel connected to his late grandfather, but the machine \u201cmade writing fun again\u201d.</p> <p>In spring 2013, he and his wife, Hilary, left their jobs in New York City and opened the Literati Bookstore in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ann Arbor has a proud tradition of independent bookshops: it once had more per capita than any other US city. The original Borders was opened there by Tom and Louis Borders in 1971. But it closed in 2011, amid doom-laden newspaper headlines predicting the death of the high-street bookshop.</p> <p>Friends told them they were crazy: \u201cHow can you survive if Borders couldn\u2019t?\u201d But although they admitted to being \u201cterrified\u201d, the Gustafsons were not deterred. This was personal: \u201cOpening a community-minded independent bookstore was a dream we\u2019d shared since we bonded over books on our first date.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a delightfully quirky celebration of a past analogue era of ink, paper and mechanical keys</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Literati\u2019s logo is a typewriter and his grandfather\u2019s Smith Corona is proudly displayed by the store\u2019s cash register. On the lower level of the shop, they set up a light blue Olivetti Lettera 32, inserted a clean sheet of white paper and left it there, \u201cthe world\u2019s smallest publishing house, waiting for an author\u201d. Gustafson admits that they did wonder whether people would even know how to use it. But at the end of the first day he saw the words \u201cThank you for being here\u201d. It was as if \u201cthe typewriter itself was thanking me\u201d.</p> <p>Since then, Literati\u2019s public typewriter has become part of the shop\u2019s identity. People have used it to propose, to admit fears, to apologise, to joke and to philosophise. Some of the best notes are put up on a wall behind the typewriter and used on the shop\u2019s social media account. The artist Oliver Uberti (the book\u2019s designer) has even painstakingly copied some on to the shop\u2019s brick walls using the exact font of the old Smith Corona, \u201csmudgy e\u2019s, q\u2019s, and all\u201d.</p> <p>The anonymous notes collected in this short but beautifully designed book offer ample evidence of the success of this \u201cpublic typewriter experiment\u201d. They range from the banal (\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d) and the amusing (\u201cmisspelling is a suign of genius\u201d), to the poignant: \u201cI spent 22 years telling her to do great things. Now that she has gone to do them I am sad.\u201d Some verge on the profound: \u201cLife, like this typewriter, has no backspace. Type strongly and don\u2019t look back.\u201d</p> <p>This is a delightfully quirky, heart-warming celebration of the \u201cmessy, smudgy, imperfect beauty\u201d of a past analogue era of ink, paper and mechanical keys. As a succinct note puts it: \u201ci love it when you talk typewriter to me\u201d.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Notes from a Public Typewriter by Michael Gustafson &amp; Oliver Uberti is published by Scribe (RRP \u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "The first typewriter Michael Gustafson fell in love with was a 1930s Smith Corona. As a child he saw it on his grandfather\u2019s writing desk and later, when he was a struggling writer, his grandmother gave it to him. \u201cClick-clacking\u201d on the old typewriter \u201cstirred something\u201d in him: not only did he feel connected to his late grandfather, but the machine \u201cmade writing fun again\u201d. In spring 2013, he and his wife, Hilary, left their jobs in New York City and opened the Literati Bookstore in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Ann Arbor has a proud tradition of independent bookshops: it once had more per capita than any other US city. The original Borders was opened there by Tom and Louis Borders in 1971. But it closed in 2011, amid doom-laden newspaper headlines predicting the death of the high-street bookshop. Friends told them they were crazy: \u201cHow can you survive if Borders couldn\u2019t?\u201d But although they admitted to being \u201cterrified\u201d, the Gustafsons were not deterred. This was personal: \u201cOpening a community-minded independent bookstore was a dream we\u2019d shared since we bonded over books on our first date.\u201d Literati\u2019s logo is a typewriter and his grandfather\u2019s Smith Corona is proudly displayed by the store\u2019s cash register. On the lower level of the shop, they set up a light blue Olivetti Lettera 32, inserted a clean sheet of white paper and left it there, \u201cthe world\u2019s smallest publishing house, waiting for an author\u201d. Gustafson admits that they did wonder whether people would even know how to use it. But at the end of the first day he saw the words \u201cThank you for being here\u201d. It was as if \u201cthe typewriter itself was thanking me\u201d. Since then, Literati\u2019s public typewriter has become part of the shop\u2019s identity. People have used it to propose, to admit fears, to apologise, to joke and to philosophise. Some of the best notes are put up on a wall behind the typewriter and used on the shop\u2019s social media account. The artist Oliver Uberti (the book\u2019s designer) has even painstakingly copied some on to the shop\u2019s brick walls using the exact font of the old Smith Corona, \u201csmudgy e\u2019s, q\u2019s, and all\u201d. The anonymous notes collected in this short but beautifully designed book offer ample evidence of the success of this \u201cpublic typewriter experiment\u201d. They range from the banal (\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say\u201d) and the amusing (\u201cmisspelling is a suign of genius\u201d), to the poignant: \u201cI spent 22 years telling her to do great things. Now that she has gone to do them I am sad.\u201d Some verge on the profound: \u201cLife, like this typewriter, has no backspace. Type strongly and don\u2019t look back.\u201d This is a delightfully quirky, heart-warming celebration of the \u201cmessy, smudgy, imperfect beauty\u201d of a past analogue era of ink, paper and mechanical keys. As a succinct note puts it: \u201ci love it when you talk typewriter to me\u201d. \u2022 Notes from a Public Typewriter by Michael Gustafson &amp; Oliver Uberti is published by Scribe (RRP \u00a39.99).

      "bodyText": "Former Greens leader Bob Brown is undeterred in his campaign to stop the Adani coal mine in central Queensland, warning \u201cwe will make this international\u201d at a protest in Canberra. Queensland\u2019s environment department on Thursday signed off on the company\u2019s plan to manage groundwater on and around its Galilee Basin mine site, allowing it to begin work on its Carmichael coal mine. But this hasn\u2019t halted the \u201cStop Adani\u201d protests, with some 200 campaigners holding a vigil outside the Indian High Commission on Saturday. Labor\u2019s poor election showing in Queensland was blamed partly on Brown and his anti-Adani convoy, with locals viewing their protests in the region as the south telling the north what to do. \u201cThis is hogwash,\u201d said Brown before addressing his supporters. \u201cThe biggest person telling Queenslanders what to do here is Gautam Adani. He\u2019s pulling the strings from over in India on a stack of politicians and media.\u201d He said the election result and the go-ahead for mine construction would not spell the end of the anti-Adani protests. \u201cWe will make this international,\u201d the former senator pledged. The group was protesting outside the Indian High Commission because the high commissioner Ajay Gondane had called for the Adani mine to go ahead. \u201cNow if the Indian high commissioner here is dancing to the tune of Gautum Adani, if he wants to interfere in Australian domestic affairs, let me tell you high commissioner, we will interfere in your Indian domestic affairs,\u201d he said to cheers from his supporters. He said the Adani company has an appalling record of environmental destruction and corruption overseas, particularly in its home country of India and the forested areas inhabited by the Gond peoples. \u201cThis brute of a billionaire is riding right over the top of them,\u201d Brown said. The groundwater approval means Adani will now be able to begin preliminary work, such as land-clearing and road access development at its mine site. But it still requires other federal environmental approvals before it can begin extracting coal. Other aspects of the project, such as a royalties agreement, are also yet to be finalised.

It felt as though there were still a lot of closed doors for people taking less conventional paths.

Perhaps I would, as I read so much; nothing else gives you such a finely tuned radar for rubbish writing. But I can honestly say that I have no urge to write a book. For now, I only love writing about them.</p>",

Why do you think this area resonates so much with readers and podcast listeners? Literature is tied to issues of national identity, censorship and freedom of speech. I think you can tell a lot about a country by how it treats its library service, and a country\u2019s leader on how they treat their authors. Authors are the canary in the coalmine for so many social issues \u2013 we can see in the fluctuations on the bestseller charts how people value their guidance on anything from women\u2019s rights to sovereignty. And while you might like sci-fi and I prefer poetry, those who we might call \u201cbook people\u201d tend to gravitate to each other owing to the sheer love of reading. At the Guardian, we are blessed to be able to dedicate the resources and time to cover books properly when a lot of places are cutting their culture journalism back. As wonderful as it is to do as a job, it is really hard work to write about books. You need to read a lot to understand the wider context a book is working in, and getting a sense of a book naturally takes more time than watching a film or seeing a play. I think people like what we do because they can see the effort that goes into what we produce. And we also provide them a home for them to talk about books back to us, like our weekly Tips, Links and Suggestions callout, or the Reading Group, where we select a different book to dissect every month. We have regulars who have been with us for years. I love them all, even when they hate the books that I like. What are the big challenges facing the industry? The biggest influence on publishing right now is Amazon. It utterly dominates online bookselling, and while people are beginning to see value in the presence of physical bookshops and libraries, a lot of power lies with one retailer and I don\u2019t think that is ever healthy. And while I think self-publishing is in itself a good thing, I think there are a lot of questions that need to be asked about whether it was the great democratising force we wanted it to be, or whether it has introduced new problems like piracy and scamming. Have you ever, or will you ever, turn your hand to writing? I\u2019m asked this question quite a lot, often by very generous authors and publishers who then go to great lengths to assure me that I\u2019d likely do an OK job. Perhaps I would, as I read so much; nothing else gives you such a finely tuned radar for rubbish writing. But I can honestly say that I have no urge to write a book. For now, I only love writing about them.",

Young women in school uniforms can be offered for reflexology and massage treatments, photography sessions and \u201cworkshops\u201d in which girls reveal glimpses of their underwear as they sit folding origami or creating jewellery.</p> \n<p>But while many of these have a strict no-touch policy, a proportion do lead to physical encounters. And while non-physical encounters may make up the majority of reported cases of JK activity, the fact that sex does not take place does not mean no harm is done.</p> \n<p>In 2016, Maud De Boer-Buquicchio, the UN special rapporteur on child sex trafficking and sexual abuse, raised <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=19975&amp;LangID=E\">serious concerns</a> about Japan\u2019s JK and pornography industry. She highlighted the lack of up-to-date official data and called for a comprehensive strategy to tackle the root causes of exploitation, noting that other forms of popular Japanese entertainment, including \u201cjunior idol culture\u201d, are worrying examples of children being treated as sexual commodities.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe almost allow men to say: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m attracted to young children, as young as 14, 15,\u2019\u201d says Shihoko Fujiwara, founder of Lighthouse, a charity working to end human trafficking in Japan. \u201cEven on TV, comedians will say: \u2018I like to date junior high school girls.\u2019 People make fun of those comments, but still they are made.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3c0e931f5aa8c84bb7b860a9ebb3b97f6347b069\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c0e931f5aa8c84bb7b860a9ebb3b97f6347b069/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eighteen-year-old cafe worker Airi chats with a customer.

Crucially, in the case of JK businesses, Japan has no specific anti-trafficking laws in place. Ordinarily, a child under 18 involved in sex work is automatically considered trafficked, with harsh penalties for those responsible.</p> \n<p>Pornography laws relating to children are also limited \u2013 they do not, for example, cover manga, anime, or virtually created content, allowing games such as 2006\u2019s controversial (and now no longer available) RapeLay, in which the player stalks and attempts to rape a single mother and her two school-age daughters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>A society that commercialises and consumes underage women as a sexually high-value commodity has a problem</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2017, with the Olympics approaching, the police cracked down on the rising number of JK businesses across Tokyo. </p> \n<p>A new ordinance requires JK businesses to be registered with the police, and prohibits the employment of girls under the age of 18. JK businesses cannot be located within 200 metres of schools, nurseries, hospitals or other public buildings, and no one under 18 can distribute fliers for the businesses, or recruit other teenagers.</p> \n<p>Superintendent Hiroyuki Nakada, deputy manager of the Juvenile Support Division, says the police are confident that their strategy is working. But he says educating children on the dangers is also key: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to control.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nakada says that thanks to the new, tight regulations, just three shops were prosecuted and fined last year. </p> \n<p>\u201cOver the past two years, since the ordinance came into force, we haven\u2019t seen [underage] girls [in JK businessess]\u201d says Nakada. \u201c[Officers] have visited these shops, but they haven\u2019t seen girls. But we think maybe there\u2019s a loophole, maybe there are girls working, but they are probably adults who are wearing uniforms ... they call it JK business but they are probably pretending to be schoolchildren.\u201d</p> \n<p>Critics argue that business owners have found new ways to circumvent the law. The problem may now simply be less visible; more owners operate online, away from physical shops and cafes, and some may have simply opened new businesses under different guises.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa1f9ff233400bc487152ff43d8d9ba20a0b0a15\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa1f9ff233400bc487152ff43d8d9ba20a0b0a15/0_0_441_594/371.jpg\" alt=\"Police officers verify the age of girls working at a dating service pairing up men with teenage schoolgirls in Tokyo\u2019s Akihabara district.\" width=\"371\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers verify the age of girls working in Tokyo\u2019s Akihabara district.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kyodo News/Kyodo News via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAfter the issue of JK business regulation in 2017 some shops are still operating but under a different name, such as \u2018cosplay cafe\u2019,\u201d says Yumeno Nito of Colabo. \u201cJK business owners are cunning and systematic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are also very good at social media so they put an advert on blogs or Twitter, Line where the girls will see them. The shop opens a Twitter account and they follow girls using it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fujiwara believes that the government trying to crack down on JK business may look good on the surface, but does nothing to ban other types exploitation.

      "bodyText": "On a humid Wednesday night the streets of Kabukicho, Tokyo\u2019s most famous red light district, hum with people. Some are tourists, here to gawp and take selfies, but others are customers. Adverts for clubs flash and sing and girls dressed as maids hold signs offering deals for local bars. In a grubby shopfront a perky cartoon featuring a cute Mr Men-style creature offers part-time work. The ad, which has an alarmingly catchy jingle, doesn\u2019t specify what the work is, but it doesn\u2019t need to: the answer is all around us on the brightly lit billboards advertising the charms of male and female bar hosts. Tokyo is famous for its fairly wild red light scene. You can find anything from a handsome man to make you cry and wipe away your tears to a maid to pour your drinks and giggle at your jokes and an encounter in one of the notorious \u201csoapland\u201d brothels. You can also pay to spend time with a schoolgirl. Services might include a chat over a cup of tea, a walk in the park or perhaps a photograph \u2013 with some places offering rather more intimate options. Or at least, you can for now \u2013 unless the people inside the garish pink bus have their way. Run by the charity Colabo since October 2018, the pink bus appears in strategically chosen spaces in the city once a week; tonight it is parked outside Shinjuku town hall. Volunteers hope to use it to provide a safe space for school-age girls at risk of being lured into the joshi kosei, or JK business, as the schoolgirl-themed services are known. \u201cJK business scouts tend to be men in their 20s and 30s,\u201d says Yumeno Nito of Colabo. \u201cThey are very aware of trends and are good at knowing the girls\u2019 economic status by looking at their clothes and makeup.\u201d Poverty and low self-esteem are often factors in the manipulation of young girls by scouts, Nito says. The fetishisation of Japanese schoolgirls in Japanese culture has been linked by some academics to a 1985 song called Please Don\u2019t Take Off My School Uniform, released by the female idol group O-nyanko Club, and re-released by no less mainstream a group than AKB48, one of the highest-earning musical performers in Japan and whose single Teacher Teacher sold more than 3m copies in 2018. The term \u201cJK business\u201d has become a catch-all for cafes, shops and online agencies which provide a range of \u201cactivities\u201d, many of which are not overtly sexual. Young women in school uniforms can be offered for reflexology and massage treatments, photography sessions and \u201cworkshops\u201d in which girls reveal glimpses of their underwear as they sit folding origami or creating jewellery. But while many of these have a strict no-touch policy, a proportion do lead to physical encounters. And while non-physical encounters may make up the majority of reported cases of JK activity, the fact that sex does not take place does not mean no harm is done. In 2016, Maud De Boer-Buquicchio, the UN special rapporteur on child sex trafficking and sexual abuse, raised serious concerns about Japan\u2019s JK and pornography industry. She highlighted the lack of up-to-date official data and called for a comprehensive strategy to tackle the root causes of exploitation, noting that other forms of popular Japanese entertainment, including \u201cjunior idol culture\u201d, are worrying examples of children being treated as sexual commodities. \u201cWe almost allow men to say: \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m attracted to young children, as young as 14, 15,\u2019\u201d says Shihoko Fujiwara, founder of Lighthouse, a charity working to end human trafficking in Japan. \u201cEven on TV, comedians will say: \u2018I like to date junior high school girls.\u2019 People make fun of those comments, but still they are made.\u201d Japan\u2019s anti-prostitution laws broadly prohibit the sale and purchase of sex, but there are significant loopholes, of which establishments such as soaplands take full advantage. Crucially, in the case of JK businesses, Japan has no specific anti-trafficking laws in place. Ordinarily, a child under 18 involved in sex work is automatically considered trafficked, with harsh penalties for those responsible. Pornography laws relating to children are also limited \u2013 they do not, for example, cover manga, anime, or virtually created content, allowing games such as 2006\u2019s controversial (and now no longer available) RapeLay, in which the player stalks and attempts to rape a single mother and her two school-age daughters. In 2017, with the Olympics approaching, the police cracked down on the rising number of JK businesses across Tokyo. A new ordinance requires JK businesses to be registered with the police, and prohibits the employment of girls under the age of 18. JK businesses cannot be located within 200 metres of schools, nurseries, hospitals or other public buildings, and no one under 18 can distribute fliers for the businesses, or recruit other teenagers. Superintendent Hiroyuki Nakada, deputy manager of the Juvenile Support Division, says the police are confident that their strategy is working. But he says educating children on the dangers is also key: \u201cIt\u2019s not enough just to control.\u201d Nakada says that thanks to the new, tight regulations, just three shops were prosecuted and fined last year. \u201cOver the past two years, since the ordinance came into force, we haven\u2019t seen [underage] girls [in JK businessess]\u201d says Nakada. \u201c[Officers] have visited these shops, but they haven\u2019t seen girls. But we think maybe there\u2019s a loophole, maybe there are girls working, but they are probably adults who are wearing uniforms ... they call it JK business but they are probably pretending to be schoolchildren.\u201d Critics argue that business owners have found new ways to circumvent the law. The problem may now simply be less visible; more owners operate online, away from physical shops and cafes, and some may have simply opened new businesses under different guises. \u201cAfter the issue of JK business regulation in 2017 some shops are still operating but under a different name, such as \u2018cosplay cafe\u2019,\u201d says Yumeno Nito of Colabo. \u201cJK business owners are cunning and systematic. \u201cThey are also very good at social media so they put an advert on blogs or Twitter, Line where the girls will see them. The shop opens a Twitter account and they follow girls using it.\u201d Fujiwara believes that the government trying to crack down on JK business may look good on the surface, but does nothing to ban other types exploitation. She also points out that more attention should be paid to buyers and to trying to change the mindset of a society that accepts commodifying children. It was the success of Please Don\u2019t Take off My School Uniform that some argue sparked the notorious 1990s trend for buru sera \u2013 teenage girls selling their unwashed uniforms, underwear and swimwear. From this sprang the practice of enjo kosai, or compensated dating, in which middle-aged men offered financial support to teenage girls in return for sexual relationships. This practice then became diversified and commodified into what is now know as JK business. Nito also emphasises that the police emphasis on educating children does nothing to tackle the demand side of the JK business: \u201cIt is necessary to focus on offenders and not only on child victims. It is necessary to educate and regulate adults or offenders who buy girls a lot more than educating children.\u201d With the Rugby World Cup and the Olympics due to happen in Tokyo in quick succession, both charities are concerned about the potential impact of thousands of curious tourists. Another major issue is sex education in Tokyo\u2019s schools. \u201cThere\u2019s no sex education,\u201d Fujiwara says baldly. \u201cYou can\u2019t mention \u2018intercourse\u2019 or \u2018sex\u2019, but they have to somehow teach about HIV and contraception \u2013 how do you teach that without saying \u2018sex\u2019? \u201d Although the police might count it a victory that some JK businesses no longer employ those under 18, Nito argues that it does not touch the root of the problem.

There are 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UK, and of these about 1.2 million have children.</p> <p>Last summer, the supreme court <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/aug/30/denying-unmarried-mother-widows-allowance-ruled-illegal\" title=\"\">ruled that denying Siobhan McLaughlin a widow\u2019s pension</a> following the death of her partner breached the human rights of her and the couple\u2019s four children. Her partner John Adams, a former groundsman, died in January 2014.</p> <p>The decision was expected to trigger changes in the rules, but there has been no announcement, or even a consultation on extending who qualifies for the benefits.</p> <p>Georgia Elms, a spokeswoman for the group <a href=\"https://www.widowedandyoung.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Widowed &amp; Young</a> (WAY), says: \u201cI understand that we\u2019ve got Brexit paralysis, but I\u2019m really shocked that nothing has been done about it.\u201d</p> <p>McLaughin\u2019s case involved the widowed parent\u2019s allowance, which was worth up to \u00a3119 a week and paid until the youngest child was no longer eligible for child benefit.</p> <p>Before the rules were changed, campaigners had lobbied for a rethink, and for any new system to include unmarried couples. Both calls were ignored, they say.</p> <p>Elms says families are suffering as a result. \u201cThere are two sides to this: the financial and the personal,\u201d she says. \u201cThese people are grieving \u2013 they\u2019ve lost the parent of their child, and then they are suddenly told that in the eyes of the government, because they\u2019re not married, they don\u2019t matter.\u201d</p> <p>She adds: \u201cThis really affects their confidence, their grieving process, their ability to build their own life.\u201d</p> <p>Elms says many parents who are entitled to the benefit spend the money on childcare, allowing them to continue in work.</p> <p>Spencer had to leave his job of 13 years because the shifts were not compatible with nursery hours, and now his son is at school he works on the minimum wage during school hours. He would have been entitled to up to \u00a3119 a week if he had been married. \u201cThe person who is suffering is my son,\u201d he says. \u201cHolidays, days out \u2013 he doesn\u2019t get those things. We could have saved the money and used it for holidays \u2026 you get quite angry when you think about it.\u201d</p> <p>Vicki Wollerton from Warrington, Cheshire, lost her partner Nick in May 2017. He had been looking after their son while she worked full-time as a civil servant, and the family had been entitled to a small child tax credit payment.</p> <p>The couple, who had been together for 18 years, had never married. \u201cWe never even thought about getting married \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t us,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Wollerton had set up insurance for her income, but says she had never considered what would happen if Nick died. After his death, the child tax credit payment was stopped and she discovered she would have to apply for universal credit to replace it, and that she was not entitled to any bereavement payments.</p> <p>She says the payment would have made a difference \u2013 she has used up all of her savings, most of it on childcare, and because of her working hours she now has to pay for breakfast club every morning.</p> <p>\u201cI thought I was savvy but obviously I wasn\u2019t. I had no idea my son would be treated differently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was quite a shock.\u201d</p> <p>MPs on the Commons work and pensions select committee have launched an inquiry looking into the support on offer for the bereaved, and say they will press the government on what has been done since the supreme court ruling.</p> <p>The committee recommended in 2016 that bereavement payments should be extended to parents who were not married because \u201cnot doing so unjustly penalises innocent children, who have no say in the matter of whether their parents were married but who are equally affected by the death of one of them\u201d.</p> <p>The committee\u2019s chair, Frank Field, <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2017/support-for-bereaved-inquiry-launch-17-19/\" title=\"\">has </a><a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/work-and-pensions-committee/news-parliament-2017/support-for-bereaved-inquiry-launch-17-19/\" title=\"\">described the policy</a> as archaic and said it was a \u201cprofound injustice\u201d that parents were being denied support. It meant, he said, that every day the government was telling another five bereaved parents that because they were not married, their children would be penalised.</p> <p>Last week the committee <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/work-and-pensions-committee/support-for-the-bereaved/oral/102802.html\" title=\"\">heard evidence from several parents</a>: some who were eligible for bereavement support, and some who were not. The latter group included Joana Niemeyer, who was eight months pregnant when her partner David died. Their children are now three-and-a-half and seven. She said her partner had probably earned 70% of the income for the household, and they had bought a house a year earlier and had a \u201chuge\u201d mortgage.</p> <p>She told MPs: \u201cI think I found out just before the funeral that we were not eligible for anything \u2026 David worked for 20 years. He was always a believer in the system \u2013 the NHS, national insurance and all that. I think he would be mortified to know that we did not get anything.\u201d</p> <p>Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow in north-east London, says: \u201cThe courts were clear that children who had already suffered the trauma of losing a parent early in life did not deserve to pay the price for such an outdated view of family life, and the government had a responsibility to change that.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s now been some time since the introduction of bereavement support payment, she says, yet \u201cstill this government has done nothing to help address this blatant discrimination, leaving many facing poverty at the same time as the loss of a loved one\u201d.</p> <p>Spencer says he does not expect the government to go back and repay parents like him who have missed out. \u201cBut for other people, hopefully it could change in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The Department for Work and Pensions says the qualifying criteria for bereavement support were debated in parliament before the new benefit was introduced, and that it is not taxed or included when other means-tested payments are calculated.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to supporting people during bereavement and have widened the support available. This is in addition to help provided for cohabiting couples through the wider welfare system,\u201d a spokesman for the DWP added.</p>",

The couple had been together for five years, and he was thinking about proposing when she died. \u201cI rang the number on the government website and was told I wasn\u2019t eligible for any benefits,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said \u2018that\u2019s the law.\u2019 All because of a piece of paper.\u201d Bereavement support payment, which was introduced in April 2017 to replace three separate payments (widowed parent\u2019s allowance, bereavement payment and bereavement allowance), is paid as a lump sum of up to \u00a33,500 and then at a rate of up to \u00a3350 a month for the first 18 months after the death. Those who lost a partner before the rule change can continue to claim the older benefits until their children leave full-time education or they move in with a new partner. However, anyone who loses a partner who they were not married to is not entitled to make a claim. There are 3.3 million cohabiting couples in the UK, and of these about 1.2 million have children. Last summer, the supreme court ruled that denying Siobhan McLaughlin a widow\u2019s pension following the death of her partner breached the human rights of her and the couple\u2019s four children. Her partner John Adams, a former groundsman, died in January 2014. The decision was expected to trigger changes in the rules, but there has been no announcement, or even a consultation on extending who qualifies for the benefits. Georgia Elms, a spokeswoman for the group Widowed &amp; Young (WAY), says: \u201cI understand that we\u2019ve got Brexit paralysis, but I\u2019m really shocked that nothing has been done about it.\u201d McLaughin\u2019s case involved the widowed parent\u2019s allowance, which was worth up to \u00a3119 a week and paid until the youngest child was no longer eligible for child benefit. Before the rules were changed, campaigners had lobbied for a rethink, and for any new system to include unmarried couples. Both calls were ignored, they say. Elms says families are suffering as a result. \u201cThere are two sides to this: the financial and the personal,\u201d she says. \u201cThese people are grieving \u2013 they\u2019ve lost the parent of their child, and then they are suddenly told that in the eyes of the government, because they\u2019re not married, they don\u2019t matter.\u201d She adds: \u201cThis really affects their confidence, their grieving process, their ability to build their own life.\u201d Elms says many parents who are entitled to the benefit spend the money on childcare, allowing them to continue in work. Spencer had to leave his job of 13 years because the shifts were not compatible with nursery hours, and now his son is at school he works on the minimum wage during school hours. He would have been entitled to up to \u00a3119 a week if he had been married. \u201cThe person who is suffering is my son,\u201d he says. \u201cHolidays, days out \u2013 he doesn\u2019t get those things. We could have saved the money and used it for holidays \u2026 you get quite angry when you think about it.\u201d Vicki Wollerton from Warrington, Cheshire, lost her partner Nick in May 2017. He had been looking after their son while she worked full-time as a civil servant, and the family had been entitled to a small child tax credit payment. The couple, who had been together for 18 years, had never married. \u201cWe never even thought about getting married \u2013 it just wasn\u2019t us,\u201d she says. Wollerton had set up insurance for her income, but says she had never considered what would happen if Nick died. After his death, the child tax credit payment was stopped and she discovered she would have to apply for universal credit to replace it, and that she was not entitled to any bereavement payments. She says the payment would have made a difference \u2013 she has used up all of her savings, most of it on childcare, and because of her working hours she now has to pay for breakfast club every morning. \u201cI thought I was savvy but obviously I wasn\u2019t. I had no idea my son would be treated differently,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was quite a shock.\u201d MPs on the Commons work and pensions select committee have launched an inquiry looking into the support on offer for the bereaved, and say they will press the government on what has been done since the supreme court ruling. The committee recommended in 2016 that bereavement payments should be extended to parents who were not married because \u201cnot doing so unjustly penalises innocent children, who have no say in the matter of whether their parents were married but who are equally affected by the death of one of them\u201d. The committee\u2019s chair, Frank Field, has described the policy as archaic and said it was a \u201cprofound injustice\u201d that parents were being denied support. It meant, he said, that every day the government was telling another five bereaved parents that because they were not married, their children would be penalised. Last week the committee heard evidence from several parents: some who were eligible for bereavement support, and some who were not. The latter group included Joana Niemeyer, who was eight months pregnant when her partner David died. Their children are now three-and-a-half and seven. She said her partner had probably earned 70% of the income for the household, and they had bought a house a year earlier and had a \u201chuge\u201d mortgage. She told MPs: \u201cI think I found out just before the funeral that we were not eligible for anything \u2026 David worked for 20 years. He was always a believer in the system \u2013 the NHS, national insurance and all that. I think he would be mortified to know that we did not get anything.\u201d Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow in north-east London, says: \u201cThe courts were clear that children who had already suffered the trauma of losing a parent early in life did not deserve to pay the price for such an outdated view of family life, and the government had a responsibility to change that.\u201d It\u2019s now been some time since the introduction of bereavement support payment, she says, yet \u201cstill this government has done nothing to help address this blatant discrimination, leaving many facing poverty at the same time as the loss of a loved one\u201d. Spencer says he does not expect the government to go back and repay parents like him who have missed out. \u201cBut for other people, hopefully it could change in the future.\u201d The Department for Work and Pensions says the qualifying criteria for bereavement support were debated in parliament before the new benefit was introduced, and that it is not taxed or included when other means-tested payments are calculated. \u201cWe are committed to supporting people during bereavement and have widened the support available. This is in addition to help provided for cohabiting couples through the wider welfare system,\u201d a spokesman for the DWP added.",

He soon discovers that the actor is a drunk and a narcissist, wild-tempered, generous and vain. It is impossible not to fall in love with him, just as it is impossible not to fall for the divinely charismatic Terry. The friendship between the three, their fallings-out and reunions, are the heart of the book \u2013 poor \u201cnoble\u201d Flo can\u2019t compete.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is a hugely entertaining book about friendship and love \u2013 it is also a story of transience, loss and true loyalty</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The problem with novels about towering historical figures is that most often the author hasn\u2019t the wit or brilliance to capture them, but <em>Shadowplay</em> is a book undaunted. One gives up wondering what is true, because it all is. Huge names come and go: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/oscar-wilde\" title=\"\">Oscar Wilde</a> has a tragicomic cameo; Jack the Ripper terrorises the London streets; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/wbyeats\" title=\"\">WB Yeats</a> is glimpsed on a Dublin bridge, \u201ca silverback gorilla in a monocle\u201d, his appearance serving only to fire Stoker\u2019s need to escape to London. Stoker seeks himself, and must lose himself to do it. There is much discussion of the self and identity in <em>Shadowplay</em>: good selves, shadow selves, hidden selves, Jekyll and Hyde selves. Sexuality and gender are shapeshifting, and there could be no better place to explore them than O\u2019Connor\u2019s vagabond world of theatre, where his characters may throw off their disguises amid the playacting. \u201cThis is how they escape the prison of the self. To see the world through the windows of someone else\u2019s room.\u201d</p> <p>And all the time, Count Dracula is in the wings, waiting \u2013 or we are waiting for him. As Stoker\u2019s immortal work grows in his subconscious, the clues mount up. At their first meeting, Irving says to Stoker, \u201cI don\u2019t bite\u201d; a Jonathan Harker comes to work at the theatre; a ghost named Mina haunts the dilapidated Lyceum at night. There is a book on theatrical effects by an Edward Helsing and a man in a lunatic asylum eats insects in his cell. The pieces of the jigsaw gather, and it is a relief when Stoker at last begins to write.</p> <p>All the wildness, wit and passion don\u2019t come without a price in <em>Shadowplay</em>, any more than in life. As the Victorian era shifts into the new century, what has been gothic and thrilling becomes grotesque in the light of modernity. Never has that reputedly gilded era seemed so pale or flat. As much as this is a hugely entertaining book about the grand scope of friendship and love, it is also, movingly \u2013 at times, agonisingly \u2013 a story of transience, loss and true loyalty. Fittingly for a novel that flirts with Dracula, <em>Shadowplay</em> also dances with death. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d asks Ellen. \u201cThat mad, blazing time when we swirled the stars in the sky.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 Sadie Jones\u2019s The Snakes is published by Chatto.

Paint dribbling down the contours of his face, like dye splashed on a map, droplets falling on his boots, his doublet and long locks drenched in sweat, his silver painted wooden sword glittering in the gaslight, shimmering with his chainmail in the lightning. Stoker leaves Dublin for London to run Irving\u2019s theatre, the Lyceum, taking his new wife, Flo, with him. He soon discovers that the actor is a drunk and a narcissist, wild-tempered, generous and vain. It is impossible not to fall in love with him, just as it is impossible not to fall for the divinely charismatic Terry. The friendship between the three, their fallings-out and reunions, are the heart of the book \u2013 poor \u201cnoble\u201d Flo can\u2019t compete. The problem with novels about towering historical figures is that most often the author hasn\u2019t the wit or brilliance to capture them, but Shadowplay is a book undaunted. One gives up wondering what is true, because it all is. Huge names come and go: Oscar Wilde has a tragicomic cameo; Jack the Ripper terrorises the London streets; WB Yeats is glimpsed on a Dublin bridge, \u201ca silverback gorilla in a monocle\u201d, his appearance serving only to fire Stoker\u2019s need to escape to London. Stoker seeks himself, and must lose himself to do it. There is much discussion of the self and identity in Shadowplay: good selves, shadow selves, hidden selves, Jekyll and Hyde selves. Sexuality and gender are shapeshifting, and there could be no better place to explore them than O\u2019Connor\u2019s vagabond world of theatre, where his characters may throw off their disguises amid the playacting. \u201cThis is how they escape the prison of the self. To see the world through the windows of someone else\u2019s room.\u201d And all the time, Count Dracula is in the wings, waiting \u2013 or we are waiting for him. As Stoker\u2019s immortal work grows in his subconscious, the clues mount up. At their first meeting, Irving says to Stoker, \u201cI don\u2019t bite\u201d; a Jonathan Harker comes to work at the theatre; a ghost named Mina haunts the dilapidated Lyceum at night. There is a book on theatrical effects by an Edward Helsing and a man in a lunatic asylum eats insects in his cell. The pieces of the jigsaw gather, and it is a relief when Stoker at last begins to write. All the wildness, wit and passion don\u2019t come without a price in Shadowplay, any more than in life. As the Victorian era shifts into the new century, what has been gothic and thrilling becomes grotesque in the light of modernity. Never has that reputedly gilded era seemed so pale or flat. As much as this is a hugely entertaining book about the grand scope of friendship and love, it is also, movingly \u2013 at times, agonisingly \u2013 a story of transience, loss and true loyalty. Fittingly for a novel that flirts with Dracula, Shadowplay also dances with death. \u201cWhere did it go?\u201d asks Ellen. \u201cThat mad, blazing time when we swirled the stars in the sky.\u201d \u2022 Sadie Jones\u2019s The Snakes is published by Chatto.

The stone circle on the Hebridean island of Lewis may be 5,000 years old, but it would not do to keep it waiting. Besides, coming here at daybreak is, from certain perspectives, positively tardy. Emma Rennie, a local photographer, considers 2am the best time to visit. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond mindblowing,\u201d she told me, ahead of my journey. \u201cThere\u2019s silence, which the world is so short of nowadays, and millions of stars. I feel small and insignificant, and I love it.\u201d</p> <p>Callanish \u2013 or Calanais in Gaelic \u2013 comprises 49 standing stones laid out in a shape that, seen from above, suggests a Celtic cross. Despite this resemblance, the site long predates Christianity and, indeed, Stonehenge. The drama is heightened by its location on a ridge above a loch. You can gaze across the water to other prehistoric sites nearby \u2013 Calanais II and Calanais III. Like Led Zeppelin albums, the stone circles around here are numbered, and they are heavy. The central monolith at Callanish is almost five metres tall and weighs around 4\u00bd tonnes. It has a pelt of lichen in pistachio green.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-15T09:51:58.html\" data-alt=\"Lewis map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-15T09:51:58.html\">Lewis map</a> </figure>  <p>This is one of the delights of Callanish, and something you can\u2019t get from the photographs \u2013 the look of the stones up close, and the tingling pleasure of the way they feel beneath your palm. Swirls, crevices, bright patches of pink granite \u2026 each stone offers a drone\u2019s-eye view of some desert landscape. The oystercatchers and swallows, peeping and piping overhead, have the right idea. Don\u2019t get too close: you could get lost in those patterns and never find your way out again.</p> <p>What, though, was Callanish for? The idea that this was some sort of druidic temple draws the crowds, especially at the summer solstice. The visitor centre and information panels play it safe with a lot of \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d; the purpose of the stones, they say, remains a mystery. When I visit Callanish expert Margaret Curtis at her home nearby, she offers greater certainty: the site, she believes, was built as a solar and lunar observatory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"53b268f224171b1a1c83e3f91d11cc9e6a91510c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53b268f224171b1a1c83e3f91d11cc9e6a91510c/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Callanish standing stones.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Callanish standing stones.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBe careful of the hairy caterpillars, won\u2019t you?\u201d she says, leading the way through her garden to the exhibition space in an outbuilding where she can better explain her theories. The caterpillars, which have white mohicans, drop from nettles and scoot out of the way as we pass. Curtis is 78, with white pigtails and star-patterned wellies, and has devoted much of her life to the study of the island\u2019s prehistoric sites.</p> <p>Brought up in Warwickshire, she moved to Lewis in 1974, fed up with the urbanisation of the English countryside. She and her young children would take long walks, getting to know the landscape, and in this way developed a knack for finding long-lost standing stones. She discovered the broken tip of one of the Callanish stones being used as part of a wall, located another stone missing from the site\u2019s eastern arm lying beneath the peat, and once identified an unrecorded stone circle while going into Stornoway, the island\u2019s biggest town, on the bus to do her shopping. \u201cThat,\u201d she says, \u201cwas quite nice.\u201d Curtis is firmly in favour of Callanish getting Unesco world heritage listing \u2013 \u201cto recognise the ability our forefathers had\u201d \u2013 but she herself might be considered a treasure of the island.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9dce73cb4133858c4584b0d3bf18958cb7d40d5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dce73cb4133858c4584b0d3bf18958cb7d40d5c/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Lewis ChessmenA bishop; a queen; a king and a berserker rook or castle made from the walrus ivory and whales teeth - part of the medieval Lewis Chess Sets.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The medieval Lewis Chessmen are made from walrus ivory and whales teeth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are others.

These are the most precious archaeological objects ever found in Scotland. The 12th-century figures were dug from the island\u2019s Atlantic coast in 1831. Despite a recent theory that they originated in Iceland, the academic consensus remains that they were made in Trondheim, Norway. How they came to be in Lewis, no one knows. The mystery is part of their magic.</p> <p>Thanks to a long-term loan from the British Museum, six of the pieces are on display at the <a href=\"https://www.cne-siar.gov.uk/leisure-sport-and-culture/museum-nan-eilean/museum-nan-eilean-stornoway/\" title=\"\">Museum nan Eilean</a> in Stornoway: king, queen, bishop, knight, pawn and warder (a rook in modern-day chess). They are the colour of tobacco-stained teeth, and are made from walrus tusks. Tiny grooves in their surface are thought to be marks left by insects burrowing in the island\u2019s white sand.</p> <p>Most striking of all are the facial expressions. The bishop, deep in thought, grasps a crozier. The queen, right hand to her cheek, has the look of saucer-eyed ennui familiar to any woman who has ever been sent an unsolicited photo of an intimate nature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c9dd183ec5f15948f2683ab6d568dc3b80c1e2f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c9dd183ec5f15948f2683ab6d568dc3b80c1e2f/0_147_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brightly colored fishing boats in Stornoway HarborStornoway Harbour, Isle of Lewis, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stornoway harbour.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This sense of a living personality is one reason why the chessmen move us. But there is something more. They are a tangible link to the people of the past and, because they are gaming pieces, they speak of human pleasure and intellect. The men and women who played with these were, perhaps, not so different from ourselves. It is easy to imagine them being held by hands that have themselves long turned to bare bone.</p> <p>Yes, there are Lewis chessmen on display in London and Edinburgh, but it is far better to see them here in Lewis \u2013 spotlit in their glass case \u2013 like watching your favourite band play a homecoming show. By way of an encore, I make the trip across the island to the spot on the west coast where they were found. Hooded crows, hunched on fenceposts, are monkish figures in feathery cowls. Peat stacks, drying out by the road, resemble beehive cells. The gorse shines bright as any illuminated gospel.</p> <p>The volunteer-run <a href=\"http://www.ceuig.co.uk/about/uig-museum/\" title=\"\">Uig Museum</a> (adult \u00a31, child free) in Timsgarry has lots of interesting material on the chess pieces and other local history, and is only two miles from the place, near the village of Ardroil, where they were uncovered by a crofter, Malcolm Macleod. A wooden king more than two metres tall sits in majestic isolation next to a layby. Behind his throne there is a stile. Cross it and you are on the <em>machair</em> \u2013 the distinctive grassy dunes of the Hebrides \u2013 and then a great arc of white sand. The precise \u201cfindspot\u201d is not known, which makes standing here, looking out over the waves, tantalising. What ivory monarchs might still lurk down there, awaiting restoration?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4917e99b9e1a020b8530899a9d43ba40d30cbfb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4917e99b9e1a020b8530899a9d43ba40d30cbfb5/803_949_3940_2364/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last year saw the Lewis's first Pride parade\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Last year saw the island\u2019s first Pride parade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Thomson/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in Stornoway, a glimpse of contemporary life: the second annual Hebridean Pride festival. Unfortunately, the rain has worsened. What had been an invigorating spritz is now drizzle with menaces. Scarlet Skylar Rae, a drag queen from the mainland, is protecting her blond-and-pink wig with a Bible-black umbrella. A local woman, Lu, expresses her support for the occasion before being dragged off in the opposite direction by Banksy, a Newfoundland dog wearing a rainbow scarf round his collar. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t 10\u00bd stone, we\u2019d be marching,\u201d she seems to say, as she recedes into the distance, dogwards.</p> <p>At the front of the parade, local GP Dave Ripley is standing through the sunroof of a Hyundai, holding a rainbow flag aloft. He is wearing a silver dress and a tiara. \u201cPriscilla Queen of the Hebrides\u201d is written on the side of the car, which is pumping out Greased Lightin\u2019 while proceeding at a stately 5mph. Imagine Delacroix\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/enlightenment-revolution/a/delacroix-liberty-leading\" title=\"\">Liberty Leading the People</a> given a disco makeover. Passing the crazy golf, the bowling green, the fishing boats, it is a stirring sight.</p> <p>Just a few years ago, the idea of having an event like this in Stornoway would have been unthinkable. Religious conservatism is still a significant part of the culture, and most shops and other businesses are closed on Sundays. But things have changed, and continue to do so.</p> <p>The vice-chair of Hebridean Pride, Amanda Maclennan, and her wife, Kirsty, were the first lesbian couple to get married on Lewis. They had met and fallen in love while working in the local supermarket, which made them the talk of the town. \u201cWe were known as The Two Lesbians From Tesco,\u201d Amanda recalls. Most gay people of her generation \u2013 she is 44 \u2013 moved away from the island, she says, because it was easier to be themselves elsewhere. But she felt unable to either leave or lie. \u201cMy choice was I lived as a lesbian or I didn\u2019t live at all.\u201d</p> <p>To stay and be who you are, that is an act of faith. Lewis is, in many ways, an island of faith \u2013 literally and figuratively. In a secular society it offers the solid ground of belief. Those ancient stones at Callanish seem to express some sort of yearning for the numinous, and so too does the dour grey harl of the Free Church in Back, a few miles north of Stornoway.</p> <p>I have come to experience a great tradition of the Hebrides \u2013 Gaelic psalm singing \u2013 while one still can. This village church is one of a few places where, every Sunday morning, this extraordinary sound can be heard.</p> <p>The congregation numbers around 150. Men in dark suits and ties. Women in hats. The nave is flooded with pearly Vermeer light. Most of the service is in English, but Psalm 73 is sung in Gaelic.</p> <p>Standing below the pulpit, the precentor leads \u2013 \u201c<em>Gidheadh, tha mise maille ruit</em> \u2026\u201d \u2013 and the people follow. There is no accompaniment, just the human voice. The singing is slow, tidal, it swells and ebbs. These are songs of praise, full of God\u2019s glory, but they ache with sorrow. This music sounds like Lewis looks and feels; it has that bleak beauty; tastes of earth and salt.

      "bodyText": "First light at Callanish. The stone circle on the Hebridean island of Lewis may be 5,000 years old, but it would not do to keep it waiting. Besides, coming here at daybreak is, from certain perspectives, positively tardy. Emma Rennie, a local photographer, considers 2am the best time to visit. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond mindblowing,\u201d she told me, ahead of my journey. \u201cThere\u2019s silence, which the world is so short of nowadays, and millions of stars. I feel small and insignificant, and I love it.\u201d Callanish \u2013 or Calanais in Gaelic \u2013 comprises 49 standing stones laid out in a shape that, seen from above, suggests a Celtic cross. Despite this resemblance, the site long predates Christianity and, indeed, Stonehenge. The drama is heightened by its location on a ridge above a loch. You can gaze across the water to other prehistoric sites nearby \u2013 Calanais II and Calanais III. Like Led Zeppelin albums, the stone circles around here are numbered, and they are heavy. The central monolith at Callanish is almost five metres tall and weighs around 4\u00bd tonnes. It has a pelt of lichen in pistachio green. This is one of the delights of Callanish, and something you can\u2019t get from the photographs \u2013 the look of the stones up close, and the tingling pleasure of the way they feel beneath your palm. Swirls, crevices, bright patches of pink granite \u2026 each stone offers a drone\u2019s-eye view of some desert landscape. The oystercatchers and swallows, peeping and piping overhead, have the right idea. Don\u2019t get too close: you could get lost in those patterns and never find your way out again. What, though, was Callanish for? The idea that this was some sort of druidic temple draws the crowds, especially at the summer solstice. The visitor centre and information panels play it safe with a lot of \u201cperhaps\u201d and \u201cpossibly\u201d; the purpose of the stones, they say, remains a mystery. When I visit Callanish expert Margaret Curtis at her home nearby, she offers greater certainty: the site, she believes, was built as a solar and lunar observatory. \u201cBe careful of the hairy caterpillars, won\u2019t you?\u201d she says, leading the way through her garden to the exhibition space in an outbuilding where she can better explain her theories. The caterpillars, which have white mohicans, drop from nettles and scoot out of the way as we pass. Curtis is 78, with white pigtails and star-patterned wellies, and has devoted much of her life to the study of the island\u2019s prehistoric sites. Brought up in Warwickshire, she moved to Lewis in 1974, fed up with the urbanisation of the English countryside. She and her young children would take long walks, getting to know the landscape, and in this way developed a knack for finding long-lost standing stones. She discovered the broken tip of one of the Callanish stones being used as part of a wall, located another stone missing from the site\u2019s eastern arm lying beneath the peat, and once identified an unrecorded stone circle while going into Stornoway, the island\u2019s biggest town, on the bus to do her shopping. \u201cThat,\u201d she says, \u201cwas quite nice.\u201d Curtis is firmly in favour of Callanish getting Unesco world heritage listing \u2013 \u201cto recognise the ability our forefathers had\u201d \u2013 but she herself might be considered a treasure of the island. There are others. The Lewis chessmen for one. These are the most precious archaeological objects ever found in Scotland. The 12th-century figures were dug from the island\u2019s Atlantic coast in 1831. Despite a recent theory that they originated in Iceland, the academic consensus remains that they were made in Trondheim, Norway. How they came to be in Lewis, no one knows. The mystery is part of their magic. Thanks to a long-term loan from the British Museum, six of the pieces are on display at the Museum nan Eilean in Stornoway: king, queen, bishop, knight, pawn and warder (a rook in modern-day chess). They are the colour of tobacco-stained teeth, and are made from walrus tusks. Tiny grooves in their surface are thought to be marks left by insects burrowing in the island\u2019s white sand. Most striking of all are the facial expressions. The bishop, deep in thought, grasps a crozier. The queen, right hand to her cheek, has the look of saucer-eyed ennui familiar to any woman who has ever been sent an unsolicited photo of an intimate nature. This sense of a living personality is one reason why the chessmen move us. But there is something more. They are a tangible link to the people of the past and, because they are gaming pieces, they speak of human pleasure and intellect. The men and women who played with these were, perhaps, not so different from ourselves. It is easy to imagine them being held by hands that have themselves long turned to bare bone. Yes, there are Lewis chessmen on display in London and Edinburgh, but it is far better to see them here in Lewis \u2013 spotlit in their glass case \u2013 like watching your favourite band play a homecoming show. By way of an encore, I make the trip across the island to the spot on the west coast where they were found. Hooded crows, hunched on fenceposts, are monkish figures in feathery cowls. Peat stacks, drying out by the road, resemble beehive cells. The gorse shines bright as any illuminated gospel. The volunteer-run Uig Museum (adult \u00a31, child free) in Timsgarry has lots of interesting material on the chess pieces and other local history, and is only two miles from the place, near the village of Ardroil, where they were uncovered by a crofter, Malcolm Macleod. A wooden king more than two metres tall sits in majestic isolation next to a layby. Behind his throne there is a stile. Cross it and you are on the machair \u2013 the distinctive grassy dunes of the Hebrides \u2013 and then a great arc of white sand. The precise \u201cfindspot\u201d is not known, which makes standing here, looking out over the waves, tantalising. What ivory monarchs might still lurk down there, awaiting restoration? Back in Stornoway, a glimpse of contemporary life: the second annual Hebridean Pride festival. Unfortunately, the rain has worsened. What had been an invigorating spritz is now drizzle with menaces. Scarlet Skylar Rae, a drag queen from the mainland, is protecting her blond-and-pink wig with a Bible-black umbrella. A local woman, Lu, expresses her support for the occasion before being dragged off in the opposite direction by Banksy, a Newfoundland dog wearing a rainbow scarf round his collar. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t 10\u00bd stone, we\u2019d be marching,\u201d she seems to say, as she recedes into the distance, dogwards. At the front of the parade, local GP Dave Ripley is standing through the sunroof of a Hyundai, holding a rainbow flag aloft. He is wearing a silver dress and a tiara. \u201cPriscilla Queen of the Hebrides\u201d is written on the side of the car, which is pumping out Greased Lightin\u2019 while proceeding at a stately 5mph. Imagine Delacroix\u2019s Liberty Leading the People given a disco makeover. Passing the crazy golf, the bowling green, the fishing boats, it is a stirring sight. Just a few years ago, the idea of having an event like this in Stornoway would have been unthinkable. Religious conservatism is still a significant part of the culture, and most shops and other businesses are closed on Sundays. But things have changed, and continue to do so. The vice-chair of Hebridean Pride, Amanda Maclennan, and her wife, Kirsty, were the first lesbian couple to get married on Lewis. They had met and fallen in love while working in the local supermarket, which made them the talk of the town. \u201cWe were known as The Two Lesbians From Tesco,\u201d Amanda recalls. Most gay people of her generation \u2013 she is 44 \u2013 moved away from the island, she says, because it was easier to be themselves elsewhere. But she felt unable to either leave or lie. \u201cMy choice was I lived as a lesbian or I didn\u2019t live at all.\u201d To stay and be who you are, that is an act of faith. Lewis is, in many ways, an island of faith \u2013 literally and figuratively. In a secular society it offers the solid ground of belief. Those ancient stones at Callanish seem to express some sort of yearning for the numinous, and so too does the dour grey harl of the Free Church in Back, a few miles north of Stornoway. I have come to experience a great tradition of the Hebrides \u2013 Gaelic psalm singing \u2013 while one still can. This village church is one of a few places where, every Sunday morning, this extraordinary sound can be heard. The congregation numbers around 150. Men in dark suits and ties. Women in hats. The nave is flooded with pearly Vermeer light. Most of the service is in English, but Psalm 73 is sung in Gaelic. Standing below the pulpit, the precentor leads \u2013 \u201cGidheadh, tha mise maille ruit \u2026\u201d \u2013 and the people follow. There is no accompaniment, just the human voice. The singing is slow, tidal, it swells and ebbs. These are songs of praise, full of God\u2019s glory, but they ache with sorrow. This music sounds like Lewis looks and feels; it has that bleak beauty; tastes of earth and salt. This is a sound that has emerged from a culture of hardship, from subsistence crofting, when life and death were closer kin than they are now. That, perhaps, is why this music seems to be on its way out: the congregations are growing ever older, ever smaller, and the music does not fit the present age. Calum Martin, a precentor at the church, is 66 and learned psalm singing as a little boy from his grandfather. He believes that within his lifetime those voices will be silenced. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a future as far as I can see,\u201d he says. \u201cOur traditional way of life is rapidly changing on this island, and once it\u2019s gone it\u2019s gone.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 17 June 2019.

Gone are the certainties of 2016, when Hillary Clinton was expected to trounce Trump until the exit polls came in. As more than two dozen Democratic candidates crisscross the Iowa landscape \u2013 running a gamut of choices from centrist senators to socialist firebrands, and from tech moguls to gay veterans \u2013 Iowa voters are finding the electoral landscape to be a maze.</p> <p>On the one hand, the politics and culture of 2020 have shifted in four years. The backlash against Trump helped deliver younger, more radical and less compliant Democrats into Congress at the 2018 midterms. The election of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, and their willingness to openly challenge the Democratic establishment, has offered a sense of reinvigoration and change.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is fear. Democratic voters are seared by 2016. Many do not doubt that Trump could win again, and it is pulling some of them toward candidates who may not change the world but who will not alienate those swing voters who went from Barack Obama to Trump.</p> <h2>\u2018Iowa will wean this field down\u2019</h2> <p>Randy Belcher, a creative director in advertising, is newly arrived in Iowa from Detroit and taking his new voting responsibilities seriously. He has been to a bunch of rallies and had come to see former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, who is speaking about bringing people together while sidestepping policy details in front of crates of IPA at a brewpub in Des Moines.</p> <p>\u201cThe best types of these rallies is when you have them in a bar,\u201d said Belcher. \u201cThis is such a rare opportunity to see the candidates up close. I love the fact that Iowa will wean this field down. We will decide the four or five people who will have a chance of becoming president.\u201d</p> <p>Belcher worried it may be easier for Trump to slip back into the White House in 2020 than some Democrats realize.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is pretty good. A lot of people who Trump isn\u2019t affecting in their daily lives, they can block out the craziness and the drama,\u201d he said.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worry a lot that the Democrats are going to nominate someone that\u2019s just not electable</p> <footer> <cite>Randy Belcher</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI worry a lot that the Democrats are going to nominate someone that\u2019s just not electable. The last place I would want to be would be is at a Bernie Sanders rally. I admire him tremendously. I don\u2019t think he could ever get elected in this country. His ideas are too adventurous for Americans at the moment. Trump is so toxic I want the Democrats to nominate a pragmatic person. I don\u2019t want to say play it safe. That sounds so vanilla. But at this stage, job one is we\u2019ve got to get rid of Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the voters at a Sanders rally a day earlier in Council Bluffs think voters like Belcher have it all wrong. Patrick Hickey, a 48-year-old graphic designer, thinks the lesson of 2016 is that the Democrats need more radical policies and a candidate with credibility in order to motivate people to vote.</p> <p>\u201cIf nothing else, the 2016 election showed we can\u2019t let it be close. A lot of people thought it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t affect me, there\u2019s nothing I can do. We need people to stop thinking that way and to realize there is something they can do. To get out and be vocal, be active and stop sitting down,\u201d said Hickey as Everybody Wants to Rule the World spilled out of the speakers before Sanders spoke.</p> <p>The way to get them to do that, he said, is to have policies that motivate voters.</p> <p>Still, Hickey\u2019s own position is complicated by the fact that he was so angry at what he saw as the Democratic establishment\u2019s stitch-up of the 2016 primaries in favor of Clinton that he voted for the Green candidate, Jill Stein.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t regret my vote. I would vote that way again,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to vote for the person who you think can do the best job, not the candidate who can win.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e42466eb36b011cc3f354aa5d3fdd9ac7b74cc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e42466eb36b011cc3f354aa5d3fdd9ac7b74cc7/0_66_3879_2328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrick Hickey and his son. \u2018If nothing else, the 2016 election showed we can\u2019t let it be close.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrick Hickey and his son. \u2018If nothing else, the 2016 election showed we can\u2019t let it be close.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kelsie Nieto, a 29 year-old nurse, was also irritated at the Democratic National Committee. She said she did not trust Clinton and so didn\u2019t vote for her. Speaking at the Sanders rally, she said she now regrets that.</p> <p>\u201cI will vote for whoever the candidate is this time. We\u2019ve got to get some Democrat blood in that system,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The Sanders crowd is a mix of the ageing and millennials who generally do not seem deterred by the fact he is the oldest candidate in the race at 77. Nieto said she is focused on policies, not age. So is her husband, Dan, who said he is leaning toward Warren, 69.</p> <p>Sanders relates his experience to the crowd by declaring that Iowa was where \u201cthe political revolution began\u201d four years ago.</p> <p>\u201cNobody took our campaign very seriously. It began at 3% in the polls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ideas that seemed so radical to much of America back then have gone mainstream with Medicare for All to the fore in the political debate. For that reason, Sanders stands out to Nieto as the most authentic.</p> <p>On the other side of the hall, Samantha Anzures has brought her friend, Kyrsten Correll, to see Sanders. They are both 19 and students. Anzures is a big Sanders fan. <br>\u201cI don\u2019t agree with anything Donald Trump has to say. He\u2019s evil to me. I want to see what we can do to fight against evil. I want the good to win,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Correll is \u201calong for the ride\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not very into politics. I\u2019m here to educate myself,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family talks about Trump a lot just \u2019cause my dad was in the military. I\u2019m forced to listen to that so I do want to hear what the opposite end of the spectrum has to say about things because all I hear are Republican opinions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"divider\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">divider</a> </figure>  <p><strong>Kelly Osborne is a Sanders fan</strong> to be found at a rally by the California senator Kamala Harris, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.</p> <p>\u201cI actually don\u2019t know much about her,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Osborne works at McDonald\u2019s while raising her grandson, whose parents are in prison. She earns $8.25 an hour, just a dollar above minimum wage.</p> <p>\u201cI try to make that work but some days I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a candidate that\u2019s truly for the people, not for their pocket.

The lack of affordable housing and healthcare.</p> <p>\u201cClimate change is real\u201d and an existential threat, she declared. It\u2019s a performance that suggests Harris could more than hold her own in a debate with Trump. But one of Harris\u2019 solutions \u2013 a big middle-class tax cut \u2013 sounded Trumpian to some people at the rally.</p> <p>Afterwards, in a testament to the power of personal appearances to sway votes, Osborne said she liked what she saw.</p> <p>\u201cI was impressed with her. She seems like she\u2019s telling the truth.

On the other hand, there is fear. Democratic voters are seared by 2016. Many do not doubt that Trump could win again, and it is pulling some of them toward candidates who may not change the world but who will not alienate those swing voters who went from Barack Obama to Trump. \u2018Iowa will wean this field down\u2019 Randy Belcher, a creative director in advertising, is newly arrived in Iowa from Detroit and taking his new voting responsibilities seriously. He has been to a bunch of rallies and had come to see former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, who is speaking about bringing people together while sidestepping policy details in front of crates of IPA at a brewpub in Des Moines. \u201cThe best types of these rallies is when you have them in a bar,\u201d said Belcher. \u201cThis is such a rare opportunity to see the candidates up close. I love the fact that Iowa will wean this field down. We will decide the four or five people who will have a chance of becoming president.\u201d Belcher worried it may be easier for Trump to slip back into the White House in 2020 than some Democrats realize. \u201cThe economy is pretty good. A lot of people who Trump isn\u2019t affecting in their daily lives, they can block out the craziness and the drama,\u201d he said. \u201cI worry a lot that the Democrats are going to nominate someone that\u2019s just not electable. The last place I would want to be would be is at a Bernie Sanders rally. I admire him tremendously. I don\u2019t think he could ever get elected in this country. His ideas are too adventurous for Americans at the moment. Trump is so toxic I want the Democrats to nominate a pragmatic person. I don\u2019t want to say play it safe. That sounds so vanilla. But at this stage, job one is we\u2019ve got to get rid of Trump.\u201d Some of the voters at a Sanders rally a day earlier in Council Bluffs think voters like Belcher have it all wrong. Patrick Hickey, a 48-year-old graphic designer, thinks the lesson of 2016 is that the Democrats need more radical policies and a candidate with credibility in order to motivate people to vote. \u201cIf nothing else, the 2016 election showed we can\u2019t let it be close. A lot of people thought it doesn\u2019t matter, it doesn\u2019t affect me, there\u2019s nothing I can do. We need people to stop thinking that way and to realize there is something they can do. To get out and be vocal, be active and stop sitting down,\u201d said Hickey as Everybody Wants to Rule the World spilled out of the speakers before Sanders spoke. The way to get them to do that, he said, is to have policies that motivate voters. Still, Hickey\u2019s own position is complicated by the fact that he was so angry at what he saw as the Democratic establishment\u2019s stitch-up of the 2016 primaries in favor of Clinton that he voted for the Green candidate, Jill Stein. \u201cI don\u2019t regret my vote. I would vote that way again,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have to vote for the person who you think can do the best job, not the candidate who can win.\u201d Kelsie Nieto, a 29 year-old nurse, was also irritated at the Democratic National Committee. She said she did not trust Clinton and so didn\u2019t vote for her. Speaking at the Sanders rally, she said she now regrets that. \u201cI will vote for whoever the candidate is this time. We\u2019ve got to get some Democrat blood in that system,\u201d she said. The Sanders crowd is a mix of the ageing and millennials who generally do not seem deterred by the fact he is the oldest candidate in the race at 77. Nieto said she is focused on policies, not age. So is her husband, Dan, who said he is leaning toward Warren, 69. Sanders relates his experience to the crowd by declaring that Iowa was where \u201cthe political revolution began\u201d four years ago. \u201cNobody took our campaign very seriously. It began at 3% in the polls,\u201d he said. The ideas that seemed so radical to much of America back then have gone mainstream with Medicare for All to the fore in the political debate. For that reason, Sanders stands out to Nieto as the most authentic. On the other side of the hall, Samantha Anzures has brought her friend, Kyrsten Correll, to see Sanders. They are both 19 and students. Anzures is a big Sanders fan. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with anything Donald Trump has to say. He\u2019s evil to me. I want to see what we can do to fight against evil. I want the good to win,\u201d she said. But Correll is \u201calong for the ride\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not very into politics. I\u2019m here to educate myself,\u201d she said. \u201cMy family talks about Trump a lot just \u2019cause my dad was in the military. I\u2019m forced to listen to that so I do want to hear what the opposite end of the spectrum has to say about things because all I hear are Republican opinions.\u201d Kelly Osborne is a Sanders fan to be found at a rally by the California senator Kamala Harris, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. \u201cI actually don\u2019t know much about her,\u201d she said. Osborne works at McDonald\u2019s while raising her grandson, whose parents are in prison. She earns $8.25 an hour, just a dollar above minimum wage. \u201cI try to make that work but some days I don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cI want a candidate that\u2019s truly for the people, not for their pocket. Healthcare. Raising minimum wage so we can actually make it in the world. I think Bernie Sanders does fit that bill. I think he will fight for the people and not for his pocketbook.\u201d A few minutes later Harris appeared centre stage, pulsating energy. She told the crowd she was going to spell out some truths. Her first target was Trump, who she accused of \u201cfueling hate\u201d with racism, sexism and transphobia. Then Harris got to what Osborne wanted to hear. How the American economy isn\u2019t working for working people. The lack of affordable housing and healthcare. \u201cClimate change is real\u201d and an existential threat, she declared. It\u2019s a performance that suggests Harris could more than hold her own in a debate with Trump. But one of Harris\u2019 solutions \u2013 a big middle-class tax cut \u2013 sounded Trumpian to some people at the rally. Afterwards, in a testament to the power of personal appearances to sway votes, Osborne said she liked what she saw. \u201cI was impressed with her. She seems like she\u2019s telling the truth. She doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s bullshitting,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a Kamala supporter now.\u201d Some themes are constant, none more so than healthcare. Even where the candidates are not focused on it, many Iowa voters are. Michael Voss was at a Pete Buttigieg rally in Fort Dodge. He attended because as a gay man he wanted to support Buttigieg as an LGBTQ candidate. But Voss is grappling with medical issues which take a good chunk of his income and so he also wanted to hear what the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, had to say about affordable healthcare. In his speech, Buttigieg pushed Medicare for All. But in the Q&amp;A afterwards he rejected European-style publicly run healthcare and said there should be an incremental approach to enticing people away from private insurance. Voss would like to see a public health system but accepted it\u2019s unlikely to happen soon. \u201cPrivate companies are pulling in billions a year. It\u2019s going to be hard to say, you\u2019re not going to get your money any more private companies,\u201d he said. Voss wondered whether Buttigieg\u2019s sexuality would count against him with enough American voters to make a difference at the general election. \u201cWhere he\u2019s from, people are very similar to here in Iowa. They\u2019re very conservative. That\u2019s where Mike Pence came from. But he got re-elected after he came out of the closet. So that\u2019s a good sign. I think that at a certain point people can look past a person\u2019s sexuality. But this part of the state, I\u2019m not so sure. This part of Iowa\u2019s very conservative,\u201d he said. As it is, Buttigieg is riding a wave of popularity in the state. His surge supplanted Beto O\u2019Rourke, who arrived in Iowa with the wind of media interest behind him following his impressive run against the Texas senator Ted Cruz. But O\u2019Rourke lost momentum in Iowa, as some voters wondered what he stood for. \u201cI enjoy his energy but I\u2019m hoping Biden runs,\u201d said Jim Johnson after listening to O\u2019Rourke speak in a cafe in Muscatine. \u201cWe really need someone who\u2019s thought this through.\u201d A couple of weeks later, Joe Biden waded into the race and changed the dynamic by moving to the front, albeit many months before anyone gets to vote. Marc Daniels, a sales rep to retail stores in US military bases in Europe, is Jewish and holding a \u201cMake America Kosher Again\u201d sign while waiting for the former vice-president at a packed bar in Iowa City. He has also brought kippah head coverings embroidered with Biden 2020. He did something similar for Sanders and Warren. \u201cNothing gets a candidate\u2019s attention like a personalized kippah,\u201d he said. Daniels blamed Trump for a rise in antisemitic violence in the US. \u201cTrump\u2019s policies are bringing out the darker angels in a lot of Americans who would otherwise keep quiet,\u201d he said before Biden came on stage. Of the candidates he has seen, Daniels described Warren as \u201cbook smart but cannot connect nearly as well as Bernie or Joe\u201d. He thinks Biden\u2019s probably the best candidate to beat Trump because he appeals to the middle-class voters who switched from Obama in 2016. \u201cI observed the way Joe connected with people along the rope line. He gave them the feeling that he genuinely cares about listening to them,\u201d he said. \u201cJoe was genuinely touched that I had produced the kippahs for him and he really liked the \u2018Make America Kosher Again\u2019 sign. He even signed one for me.\u201d Kaelee Keesee and Zoe Hueser, both 20-year-old pre-law students, are also checking out Biden. They agree they can support \u201canything that\u2019s not Trump\u201d. But on the question of whether Trump\u2019s opponent should be picked on policies or as the best candidate to beat him, Huesser is undecided. \u201cI\u2019ve actually struggled with that one. I think in a lot of ways I find myself questioning who could go against Trump especially when you see how the last election evolved. But I would still like it to be about the policies,\u201d she said. Neither has Biden as their favorite. Kessee is leaning toward Buttigieg. \u201cHe\u2019s my top candidate. He has a great balance because he was a war vet and that appeals to a lot of people. And also he has the great liberal policy plans. I think he would have a great chance of winning,\u201d she said. Huesser is not sure who she would support. Like many Iowans, she is still figuring it out. \u201cWe should have younger people in office right now. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to get change to happen. But if Biden were the one who got nominated, I\u2019d vote for him,\u201d she said.",

I do like to go on holiday once a year \u2013 we\u2019re off to Cyprus next week. Last year we visited Dubai. We usually spend about \u00a3800 each on the holiday plus spending money. I also like to invest in myself. I regularly buy self-development books and go on courses \u2013 for example, I recently spent \u00a3150 on a public speaking course. I feel like I\u2019ve massively turned around my life. But I\u2019ve always believed in myself. Even though I was kicked out of school, I knew what I wanted in life. I always had that kind of grit and determination in me.",

In a few moments she had suffered a violent attack that left her with a broken jaw and battered nose. Geymonat, who quickly went to her aid, was punched so forcefully her nose was broken, and her bag and Chris\u2019s phone were stolen.</p> <p>Shocked, bleeding heavily and weeping, they asked a sympathetic fellow passenger \u2013 who was distressed to the point of tears by what had happened \u2013 to take a photograph. A few days later, having spoken to their families, they decided to post it on Geymonat\u2019s Facebook page.</p> <p>\u201cWhen it happened, we were really angry,\u201d says Geymonat, who is currently taking a year\u2019s sabbatical from her medical studies to travel and work in Europe. \u201cWe decided to tell the story, because this situation needs to change, and maybe this helps a little.

Chris and Melania Geymonat, who is 28 and a doctor from Uruguay, were travelling home on a night bus, late on the evening of 30 May. They must have kissed, they think, or otherwise given away that they were on a date. To a group of young men, also sitting on the upper deck of the almost deserted N31 to Camden, that was taken as permission to shout abuse, ask how they had sex, demand, in Chris\u2019s words, that they \u201cperform\u201d. When one of them started throwing coins, Chris got up from her seat to remonstrate. In a few moments she had suffered a violent attack that left her with a broken jaw and battered nose. Geymonat, who quickly went to her aid, was punched so forcefully her nose was broken, and her bag and Chris\u2019s phone were stolen. Shocked, bleeding heavily and weeping, they asked a sympathetic fellow passenger \u2013 who was distressed to the point of tears by what had happened \u2013 to take a photograph. A few days later, having spoken to their families, they decided to post it on Geymonat\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cWhen it happened, we were really angry,\u201d says Geymonat, who is currently taking a year\u2019s sabbatical from her medical studies to travel and work in Europe. \u201cWe decided to tell the story, because this situation needs to change, and maybe this helps a little. For me, it was a moral obligation. This needs to stop.\u201d They were entirely unprepared, however, for what would happen next.

      "bodyText": "Rihanna Umbrella Security banned umbrellas from her gigs following complaints that people were getting poked in the eye. A summer song worth risking a cornea for, in our opinion. SW Beyonc\u00e9 Crazy in Love Crazy in Love is now so old that it genuinely contains the lyric \u201cgot me hoping you\u2019ll page me right now\u201d. Yet somehow, no matter how many times you hear it, it doesn\u2019t seem to tire. Even the endless Glee covers, or the funeral march version Beyonc\u00e9 recorded for the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack hasn\u2019t sullied it. SW Dizzee Rascal Bonkers When I was a child and I imagined what being on drugs was like, the noise inside my head was the rough approximation of this entire song, just with more policemen yelling at me. Now I\u2019m an adult, I\u2019m like: \u201cDamn kid. Failed your SATs but got that one right.\u201d JG Daft Punk Get Lucky Listen: we all overdid it. It\u2019s fine. Admit it now. We overplayed this song. We hammered it into the ground like a nail. It\u2019s been six years. Try it again. The little guitar riff: buh bonky bonkedy bonk. Is that a pineapple full of rum in your hand? Were those sunglasses on your face? They were not. I\u2019m afraid it is time for you to \u2026 get lucky. JG Rihanna ft Drake Work Work is sweat; it\u2019s sand in your crevices; it\u2019s that cool drip of water racing down the side of a pre-mixed cocktail can towards your thigh. Work is summer in a song; it\u2019s dry-humping anything that moves; it\u2019s Lilt; it\u2019s Rihanna in excelsis; and it\u2019s so good it doesn\u2019t matter that Drake almost ruins it. MC Lil Nas X Old Town Road One of those rare viral moments that transcends the internet and becomes a hit on planet normie. Time will tell if Lil Nas X ends up like that kid who signed a record deal after yodelling in supermarkets and ended up \u2026 yodelling in more supermarkets. SW Nelly Hot in Herre Nelly does a searing job here: \u201cIt\u2019s getting hot in here / So take off all your clothes\u201d, seeming more like some urgent government warning than a creepy chat-up line. SW Carly Rae Jepsen Call Me Maybe Is Call Me Maybe a summer banger? Not really: it\u2019s a sort of for ever-banger that just seems to make more sense in summer. If you haven\u2019t \u201caccidentally\u201d sprayed someone with the hose while washing their car on a blazing hot July day to the heady sounds of Carly Rae, though, then have you really been in love? Think about it. Not sure you have. Annul your marriage. JG DJ Khaled Wild Thoughts You, a low-ceilinged club with sweat on the walls, some very earnest chats with strangers in the bathroom, holding a can of beer to your head in a futile attempt to cool your blood: summer is here, and Wild Thoughts is the capital-H Horny soundtrack to it all. That said, the \u201cburned out, cremation\u201d line shouldn\u2019t have got past as many people as it did. JG Luis Fonzi ft Justin Bieber Despacito We should scrap star signs and just assign people personality matrices based on which bit of Despacito they sing along to. Here\u2019s my dating profile: \u201cFavorito Favorito baby looking for his Sube Sube, Sube Sube Sube. Bom Boms need not apply. Had my time wasted enough.\u201d JG Katy Perry California Gurls This song very urgently makes me want to untie the front of my bikini top despite never ever having worn one in my life. It is actually quite a weird feeling. I\u2019m turning this one off. I don\u2019t need this energy ruining my summer. JG Azealia Banks 212 In 2012, it seemed impossible that you could still have that feeling that people had the first time they heard the Velvet Underground or Public Enemy \u2013 of hearing a bolt from the blue that didn\u2019t sound like anything else. Yet 212 had that thrill, wonderfully explicitly, full of giddy cunnilanguage and nods to German house and New York disco. Now Azealia is better known for winding up Elon Musk, but this remains a perfect three minutes and 30 seconds. SW Justin Timberlake Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling In which a pre-lumberjack, post-hair relaxer Justin \u201cJT\u201d Timberlake shouts the word \u201cdance\u201d and \u201cwavy\u201d at some kids with the manic enthusiasm of a children\u2019s TV presenter whose home life is catastrophically falling apart. Guaranteed to get nervy uncle Clive dancing at the family barbecue, mind you. MC Mariah Carey We Belong Together Sure, long summer days are great, but be warned: the heatstroke-aggravated, tequila-assisted evening meltdown that often involves screaming about loyalty in the ear of someone you have only snogged once while every emotion you\u2019ve ever felt comes racing towards the surface \u2013 this is the soundtrack to that, basically. Altogether now: \u201cOh baby baby, we belong together.\u201d *Vomits* MC Iggy Azalea Fancy Very weird couple of weeks when Azalea was the biggest rapper in the world before everyone woke up from a love spell and decided she was a fraud. Still, you can\u2019t argue with this bassline and Charli XCX\u2019s rebellious vocal, which recalls that Shampoo/Daphne and Celeste era of pop when all you needed to do to be a bad girl was bunk off school and swear at your parents. SW Drake ft Wizkid &amp; Kyla One Dance In the future, when the concept of seasons is something we only remember via Instagram filters, people will ask what \u201csummer\u201d was exactly. And they\u2019ll be playing One Dance via a speaker in their finger and they\u2019ll smile fondly and say: \u201cWow, that must have been quite nice.\u201d And they\u2019d be right. MC Psy Gangnam Style One summer, my friend Richard shat himself while rollerblading, for ever tarnishing quite a nice memory of warm, endless evenings for me. Gangnam Style \u2013 essentially the musical equivalent of a thousand Instant Idiot: Just Add Alcohol \u201ccomedy\u201d T-shirts \u2013 carries the same summer-spoiling properties, reminding everyone that fun can be shat on at any moment. MC Ed Sheeran I Don\u2019t Care Why are so many of Robert De Niro\u2019s films terrible? Why wasn\u2019t there a single good gag in the last two seasons of Seinfeld? Because when you are at the top of the game you can give up trying and just churn out Skyped-in rehashes of your previous successes and wait for the cheques to roll in. SW Robin Thicke Blurred Lines Reluctant to big this song up too much in case the ghost of Marvin Gaye sues me or I get picketed by an entire university but: if you somehow strip this song of every scrap of context; if you forget the last five years of discourse; if you ignore \u201cWhat rhymes with hug me?\u201d: this song is designed to make men in red trousers embarrass themselves at a Henley afterparty, and for that reason alone, I suppose it still has a place in the summer canon. JG Cardi B ft Bad Bunny &amp; J Balvin I Like It Winter would be a lot easier to take if this ludicrous Latin-trap hybrid was pumped into every home rather than people relying on those weirdly shaped Sad lamps that always seemed like a Charlie Brooker invention anyway. The real star of this three-way pileup is Cardi B, obviously, who radiates a sort of barbecue-in-the-park-charm, even when comparing sex to furiously beating a pi\u00f1ata.

MC Black Eyed Peas I Gotta Feeling I know we\u2019re all sick of will.i.am now (launch another smartwatch about it, mate! Say something mad about wet wipes!) but with time away from him we can finally admit: he and the BEP made a curious sub-category of banger; the \u201cjust got passed the Aux cord in the back of an Uber\u201d jam, and this is the best of them. JG LMFAO ft Lauren Bennett &amp; GoonRock Party Rock Anthem If they remade Big now with your younger brother who does Fortnite dances so frantically you\u2019re worried he might not make it into his preferred secondary school, the plot would be: he gets big, he somehow forms LMFAO (with his uncle???), he makes the song Party Rock Anthem, he falls very in love with cocaine. I would, to be fair, watch it. JG Flo Rida ft David Guetta Club Can\u2019t Handle Me Basically I Gotta Feeling but featuring a super Auto-Tuned Flo Rida instead of Black Eyed Peas, Club Can\u2019t Handle Me is big night out in 2010 vibes: poppin\u2019 bottles, stripping off, sweaty nightclub, hands in the air. However, let\u2019s be real. Club can\u2019t handle you right now? Rest assured that yes, Liquid nightclub in Basingstoke can, and also it\u2019s \u00a39 for a Smirnoff Ice, thanks very much. IS BodyRockers I Like the Way This is an actual pervert\u2019s anthem. If someone crept up behind you and growled: \u201cI like the way you \u2026 act all surprised\u201d in your ear, you\u2019d call the police immediately. The vocalist\u2019s delivery suggests he\u2019s simultaneously orgasming and shitting. However, in 2005, it was basically illegal for clubs not to play it eight times a night. Weird. IS Pitbull Hotel Room Service Sampling \u2013 and ruining \u2013 the Nightcrawlers\u2019 Push the Feeling On is quite the achievement, but Pitbull did it! Shame on everyone who danced to this in the summer of 2009 because, on closer listen, Pitbull is inviting you to an orgy in a budget hotel where he declares \u201cI\u2019m the plumber tonight / I\u2019ll check yo pipes\u201d and seems to be threatening to ejaculate in your eye. Not so fun now, is it? IS Cascada Evacuate the Dancefloor Summer requires two songs to help guide us all safely to the end of it: a song to do shots to, and a song to vomit shots out to. Evacuate the Dancefloor is both of those songs. JG George Ezra Shotgun Some summer anthems earn their place by being instant classics that encapsulate the pure joy and excitement of summer. Others just mention lots of holiday words (hot sun, bikini bottoms, lager tops) and have simple lyrics that are easy for drunk festival crowds to chant. Shotgun is definitely one of these two things. IS Las Ketchup The Ketchup Song You think you\u2019re too good to try to remember the Las Ketchup dance at a heady summer marquee wedding, with sweat glistening on your forehead and children skidding around you on their knees \u2013 all the nans have got lifts home so the real fun can start \u2013 but you\u2019re not and you never will be. You think you\u2019re too good to say: \u201cHey, ha!\u201d a lot? You think you\u2019re too good for fun? You disgust me. JG Omi Cheerleader Cheerleader \u2013 or rather 2014\u2019s Felix Jaehn remix \u2013 came out in that summer we were all really into tropical house, AKA before Ed Sheeran got involved and every song had to have a horn on it. But in 2019, it\u2019s like looking back at a terrible ex, if your ex was an annoying nursery rhyme-like song. Were you only into them because they were there? Were they actually quite irritating? What were you thinking?! IS",

He sniffs it, and then lifts his leg. My wife looks round. \u201cBilly!\u201d she says. Without lowering his leg, Billy manages to turn his head all the way round to me. His eyes, peering out from his cloudy head, seem to say: this isn\u2019t going well.",

They wanted political representation for Manchester \u2013 which at the time did not have its own MP, despite a burgeoning population \u2013 and votes for working people. The gathering was peaceful, but politicians were jumpy about anything that might spark revolution. Nervous about the possibility of unrest, local magistrates sent in mounted militia who violently dispersed the crowd. Between 10 and 20 people were killed \u2013 the numbers remain disputed \u2013 and more than 650 were injured.</p> <p>One of the witnesses was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/gnmeducationcentre/john-edward-taylor-peterloo-teaching-resource-gnm-archive\">John Edward Taylor</a>, a local cotton merchant who wrote an account of the events. While parliamentary reform was slow and piecemeal, one of the more immediate outcomes of Peterloo was the Manchester Guardian \u2013 now the Guardian \u2013 established by Taylor in the aftermath of the massacre. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2017/nov/15/manchester-guardian-prospectus-1821\">1821 prospectus </a>for the paper, Taylor asserted the importance of \u201cthe influence of the public press, the spirited discussion of political questions, and the accurate detail, of facts\u201d. In the spirit of the protesters at St Peter\u2019s Field, the Manchester Guardian set out to \u201czealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty\u201d.</p> <p>Reading the prospectus today, it\u2019s striking how many of its demands for fact-led, rational reporting in the face of societal upheaval speak to our current tumultuous politics. The many events and artworks marking the bicentenary of Peterloo, including a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/nov/01/manchester-jeremy-deller-unveils-design-for-peterloo-memorial\">permanent memorial</a> designed by Jeremy Deller, open a new perspective on contemporary debates about democracy. \u201cI think the resonance is more than just the anniversary,\u201d suggests local poet <a href=\"https://symmonsroberts.com/\">Michael Symmons Roberts</a>. \u201cThere is a strange set of historical connections suddenly emerging.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a925dd7ce40da88d48c851bdfe0d844bc3f573e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a925dd7ce40da88d48c851bdfe0d844bc3f573e2/0_3_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two linked MIF19 shows will shed light on the Peterloo massacre.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two linked MIF19 shows will shed light on the Peterloo massacre.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Streit</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Peterloo and its legacy sit at the heart of this summer\u2019s Manchester International Festival.

Leading up to this, Irish multidisciplinary arts company <a href=\"http://anuproductions.ie/\">ANU</a> is staging free, immersive performances throughout the city.</p> <p>The challenge for these artists was how to commemorate Peterloo while stressing the relevance of its legacy today. ANU started with those who were killed at Peterloo and began exploring the different parts of the city they were from. Working with local artists, the company spoke to people in these various locations, asking the question: \u201cWhat would it take today to make people take to those streets from those areas?\u201d ANU\u2019s co-founder Louise Lowe wanted to examine the demands of those at Peterloo through a contemporary lens and to amplify voices that were not usually heard. Young men told ANU about police brutality; Muslim women discussed the right to gather in public; people on zero-hours contracts reflected on workers\u2019 rights.</p> <p>These conversations have produced a series of 15 installations and performances that will take place across the city on 7 July, ranging from a \u201chuge dance sequence\u201d to quieter and more intimate pieces. Lowe explains that the different events \u201cwill speak to each other, will inform each other, will question each other, will set provocations against each other\u201d. Keen festival-goers can trace a route from one piece to the next, while the hope is that passersby \u201cwill just fall into them and fall out of them as they go about their day\u201d.</p> <p>While ANU has focused on the present, Howard and Symmons Roberts\u2019 piece retells the events of Peterloo itself in the form of an elegy. At the core of the composition is what Symmons Roberts describes as a \u201chuge, woven text\u201d \u2013 a nod to the textiles industry that put Manchester on the map. Written as a grid, the libretto reflects the multiplicity of voices involved, pulling words from banners and eyewitness accounts. Each line can be read both horizontally and vertically, skipping every other word. \u201cThe idea is that you can read across in a weave, you can read down in a weave,\u201d explains Symmons Roberts. The aim is to capture \u201cthat sense of being in a vast crowd and sense emerging out of a more musical backdrop of language\u201d.</p> <p>Howard has taken multiple different patterns from the grid and set these lines to music. \u201cI used this grid to create a kind of chaos that rises into a focus that\u2019s much more clear, and then back again,\u201d she says. Over the top of this cacophony, which will be performed by the massed voices of the choirs, soprano Kate Royal will comment on the events, providing the narrative spine. Howard\u2019s music draws inspiration from the industrial sounds of the mills, the marching of the crowds on their way to St Peter\u2019s Field, and the traditional hymns to which protesters added their own lyrics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jan/04/peterloo-massacre-bloody-clash-that-changed-britain\">The bloody clash that changed Britain</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And like ANU\u2019s performances, the elegy will connect Peterloo to the present day, offering an opportunity to reflect on its legacy and what it means to us now. \u201cIt\u2019s an important moment in political history,\u201d Howard stresses, before adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a resonance with today, because I don\u2019t think this matter is fully solved, so it\u2019s still with us.\u201d</p> <p>Symmons Roberts agrees, suggesting that Peterloo \u201chas something to tell us about the connections we\u2019re making and not making with each other at the moment\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Look closely as you walk through the streets of Manchester and you might just see the small, red, circular plaque modestly marking Britain\u2019s bloodiest confrontation between protesters and the authorities. If not exactly forgotten by history, then the Peterloo massacre has certainly been neglected. It has a hallowed status in the history of the radical left, but for many members of the wider public the name means little. On 16 August 1819, tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter\u2019s Field, united by demands for parliamentary reform. They wanted political representation for Manchester \u2013 which at the time did not have its own MP, despite a burgeoning population \u2013 and votes for working people. The gathering was peaceful, but politicians were jumpy about anything that might spark revolution. Nervous about the possibility of unrest, local magistrates sent in mounted militia who violently dispersed the crowd. Between 10 and 20 people were killed \u2013 the numbers remain disputed \u2013 and more than 650 were injured. One of the witnesses was John Edward Taylor, a local cotton merchant who wrote an account of the events. While parliamentary reform was slow and piecemeal, one of the more immediate outcomes of Peterloo was the Manchester Guardian \u2013 now the Guardian \u2013 established by Taylor in the aftermath of the massacre. In his 1821 prospectus for the paper, Taylor asserted the importance of \u201cthe influence of the public press, the spirited discussion of political questions, and the accurate detail, of facts\u201d. In the spirit of the protesters at St Peter\u2019s Field, the Manchester Guardian set out to \u201czealously enforce the principles of civil and religious Liberty\u201d. Reading the prospectus today, it\u2019s striking how many of its demands for fact-led, rational reporting in the face of societal upheaval speak to our current tumultuous politics. The many events and artworks marking the bicentenary of Peterloo, including a new permanent memorial designed by Jeremy Deller, open a new perspective on contemporary debates about democracy. \u201cI think the resonance is more than just the anniversary,\u201d suggests local poet Michael Symmons Roberts. \u201cThere is a strange set of historical connections suddenly emerging.\u201d Peterloo and its legacy sit at the heart of this summer\u2019s Manchester International Festival. On 7 July, a two-part commission under the collective title The Anvil \u2013 a reference to the shape of St Peter\u2019s Field \u2013 will commemorate and reflect on the events of Peterloo. Headlining the day, a new choral piece by Symmons Roberts and composer Emily Howard will be performed by the BBC Philharmonic and a huge chorus of choirs at the Bridgewater Hall. Leading up to this, Irish multidisciplinary arts company ANU is staging free, immersive performances throughout the city. The challenge for these artists was how to commemorate Peterloo while stressing the relevance of its legacy today.

These conversations have produced a series of 15 installations and performances that will take place across the city on 7 July, ranging from a \u201chuge dance sequence\u201d to quieter and more intimate pieces.

It\u2019s a real joy for me.\u201d Queens of the new age Mary Anne Hobbs talks us through what to expect from each artist at the showcase Holly Herndon: \u201cOne of the most exciting pioneers of electronic music today. Holly is building whole new relationships with machines and AI. I think she really understands the value of integration with technology. She\u2019s creating high art collaboratively in new ways by mentoring and teaching machines. \u201cShe told me herself: \u2018It\u2019s going to be wild.\u2019\u201d Jlin: \u201cA footwork artist, her rhythm patterns are the most exciting you\u2019ll hear anywhere in the world today. Jlin is a pivotal addition to this bill. You\u2019ll see a set that you won\u2019t be able to experience in any other place, she\u2019s making it specifically for this moment. It makes my heart sing.\u201d Katie Gately: \u201cColor was extraordinary: it\u2019s a subversive, dazzling modern pop record. Katie\u2019s a fascinating sound designer, working with found sounds and also creating the sounds she wants to use herself. \u201cShe\u2019s ready to step on from where she left off with Color, and introduce us to a brand new palette.\u201d Klara Lewis: \u201cKlara makes very minimal, brooding, angular music. She calls it \u2018theatre for the ear\u2019. I\u2019ve wanted to work with her for a long time, and I\u2019ve always been fascinated by how her work will be interpreted in a live space. I can\u2019t wait to see how it unfolds.\u201d A\u00efsha Devi: \u201cA\u00efsha is a highly unpredictable, really radical artist. She\u2019s based in Berlin, and is really interested in the rituals of club life and club music. She\u2019s working with a visual artist called MFO on a special collaborative piece, which is the initial reason we put a huge screen into the venue. It\u2019s incredibly exciting.\u201d \u2022 Queens of the Electronic Underground is at the O2 Ritz, Whitworth Street West, Manchester M1 5NQ on 20 July \u2022 The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival.",

At least 1 tbsp active sourdough starter 25g wholemeal flour per pancake 25g filtered water per pancake 1 pinch bicarbonate of soda (optional) Something sweet \u2013 date syrup, honey, maple syrup, etc \u2013 to serve (optional) Mix together the starter, flour and water and leave in a warm place for three to five hours for it to rise. If the starter is sluggish and inactive, add a pinch of bicarbonate of soda to help it rise. When the batter is airy, heat a thick-based frying pan over a medium heat, brush a touch of oil around the inside, then spoon in dessertspoonfuls of the pancake mix, leaving space for them to spread out. Cook slowly until golden brown, then flip and cook for a further couple of minutes. Serve with sweet syrup or your savoury topping of choice.",

But there is a young rival hoping to outfox Fox and catch the US president\u2019s wandering media eye.</p> <p>The obscure <a href=\"https://www.oann.com/\">One America News Network (OAN)</a> makes up for its lack of clout or viewers by covering every Trump utterance, recycling conspiracy theories, downplaying Russian threats, bashing the mainstream media and championing the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda.</p> <p>Most Americans have not noticed, but the most powerful one has. The president rewards OAN with shout-outs and access wildly out of sync with its reach, leading some observers to suspect that he is playing OAN and Fox News off one another to ensure their undying affection.</p> <p>It is a stark example of how Trump as media commentator cuts both ways: while deriding mainstream outlets as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, he champions those that offer flattering coverage.

One ex-video producer, Ernest Champell, said he was told on his first day at work, \u201cYeah, we like Russia here,\u201d and recalled how the network spread conspiracy theories and ran \u201chit jobs\u201d on politicians. He quit after four months.</p> <p>The ex-staff blamed editorial meddling by OAN\u2019s founder,<strong> </strong>Robert Herring Sr, 77, a millionaire who made his fortune printing circuit boards. Based in San Diego, California, in 2004 he launched Wealth TV, a cable channel now called <a href=\"http://www.awetv.com/\">AWE (A Wealth of Entertainment)</a> that offers shows such as Dream Cruises and Marijuana Miracle Cure. In 2013, on Independence Day, Herring added One America News.</p> <p>Or, to be more accurate, is that One America News <em>Network</em>? The URL for \u201cOAN\u201d had already been acquired and, though not in use, would cost $200,000 or more, whereas \u201cOANN\u201d was available for $15-20. Robert\u2019s son Charles Herring, 53, president of Herring Broadcasting, admitted: \u201cSo we have a little branding issue, to tell you the truth. People that watch TV know us as OAN; Twitter followers know us as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OANN?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">OANN.\u201d</a></p> <p>The network struggled but jumped aboard the Trump train in the 2016 presidential election. It became the first channel to carry the celebrity billionaire businessman\u2019s campaign speeches live and in full, a luxury not afforded to other candidate. This policy has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobHerring/status/1137102876885508096\">continued during his presidency</a>; not even Fox News broadcasts every speech uninterrupted.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the only network that I know of that will carry the president\u2019s speech in its entirety and, regardless of who\u2019s the president,\u201d Charles Herring said. \u201cI really don\u2019t care who the president is: left-leaning, right-leaning, you like him, you hate him, it just seems like that\u2019s a function of the news.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cFor that reason we get accused of being a Trump supporter. There\u2019s no doubt that we think some of the results that are coming from this president are simply remarkable and they\u2019re just numbers: unemployment down to 3.2%. That\u2019s a wonderful thing and you would think that we could all applaud that. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case.\u201d</p> <p>Herring claims that OAN \u2013 which has about 150 staff including six in Washington \u2013 offers an antidote to other cable news networks\u2019 emphasis on talking heads and heated argument.</p> <p>CNN has abandoned straight news in favor of advocacy, he claims, but OAN faces the same charge. Its pundits have included the conservative firebrand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQnBmP_XqKY\">Tomi Lahren</a> and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/corey-lewandowski-lands-at-the-tv-network-that-gave-us-tomi-lahren\">Corey Lewandowski,</a> and it has served up documentaries such as <a href=\"https://www.oann.com/benghazi/\">Betrayal at Benghazi: The Cost of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Dereliction and Greed.</a> Its two talkshows, Tipping Point with Liz Wheeler and The Daily Ledger with Graham Ledger, lean heavily right. When the White House revoked the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RobHerring/status/1063133418500673536\">Herring announced that OAN</a> would join the court battle \u2013 on the administration\u2019s side.</p> <p>The approach has earned Trump\u2019s patronage and given OAN an ability to punch above its weight.

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump and Fox News are said to have one of the strongest marriages in political showbusiness. But there is a young rival hoping to outfox Fox and catch the US president\u2019s wandering media eye. The obscure One America News Network (OAN) makes up for its lack of clout or viewers by covering every Trump utterance, recycling conspiracy theories, downplaying Russian threats, bashing the mainstream media and championing the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d agenda. Most Americans have not noticed, but the most powerful one has. The president rewards OAN with shout-outs and access wildly out of sync with its reach, leading some observers to suspect that he is playing OAN and Fox News off one another to ensure their undying affection. It is a stark example of how Trump as media commentator cuts both ways: while deriding mainstream outlets as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d, he champions those that offer flattering coverage. Others, however, condemn OAN as a \u201cFox News wannabe\u201d that is run on a shoestring with a team of underpaid and inexperienced staff. An article on the Daily Beast website last month was headlined \u201cThe Hell of Working at Trump\u2019s New Favorite Network\u201d, based on interviews with four former OAN employees. One ex-video producer, Ernest Champell, said he was told on his first day at work, \u201cYeah, we like Russia here,\u201d and recalled how the network spread conspiracy theories and ran \u201chit jobs\u201d on politicians. He quit after four months. The ex-staff blamed editorial meddling by OAN\u2019s founder, Robert Herring Sr, 77, a millionaire who made his fortune printing circuit boards. Based in San Diego, California, in 2004 he launched Wealth TV, a cable channel now called AWE (A Wealth of Entertainment) that offers shows such as Dream Cruises and Marijuana Miracle Cure. In 2013, on Independence Day, Herring added One America News. Or, to be more accurate, is that One America News Network? The URL for \u201cOAN\u201d had already been acquired and, though not in use, would cost $200,000 or more, whereas \u201cOANN\u201d was available for $15-20. Robert\u2019s son Charles Herring, 53, president of Herring Broadcasting, admitted: \u201cSo we have a little branding issue, to tell you the truth. People that watch TV know us as OAN; Twitter followers know us as OANN.\u201d The network struggled but jumped aboard the Trump train in the 2016 presidential election. It became the first channel to carry the celebrity billionaire businessman\u2019s campaign speeches live and in full, a luxury not afforded to other candidate. This policy has continued during his presidency; not even Fox News broadcasts every speech uninterrupted. \u201cWe\u2019re the only network that I know of that will carry the president\u2019s speech in its entirety and, regardless of who\u2019s the president,\u201d Charles Herring said. \u201cI really don\u2019t care who the president is: left-leaning, right-leaning, you like him, you hate him, it just seems like that\u2019s a function of the news.\u201d He added: \u201cFor that reason we get accused of being a Trump supporter. There\u2019s no doubt that we think some of the results that are coming from this president are simply remarkable and they\u2019re just numbers: unemployment down to 3.2%. That\u2019s a wonderful thing and you would think that we could all applaud that. Unfortunately that\u2019s not the case.\u201d Herring claims that OAN \u2013 which has about 150 staff including six in Washington \u2013 offers an antidote to other cable news networks\u2019 emphasis on talking heads and heated argument. CNN has abandoned straight news in favor of advocacy, he claims, but OAN faces the same charge. Its pundits have included the conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren and Trump\u2019s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, and it has served up documentaries such as Betrayal at Benghazi: The Cost of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Dereliction and Greed. Its two talkshows, Tipping Point with Liz Wheeler and The Daily Ledger with Graham Ledger, lean heavily right. When the White House revoked the CNN correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s hard pass, Herring announced that OAN would join the court battle \u2013 on the administration\u2019s side. The approach has earned Trump\u2019s patronage and given OAN an ability to punch above its weight. It claims to be the fourth-rated cable news network, trailing Fox News, MSNBC and CNN but ahead of CNN Headline News, Fox Business Channel, CNBC and BBC World News \u2013 though other networks dispute this. OAN says it has 35 million subscribers and its total viewers at any given time can range from about 150,000 to upwards of half a million. In August 2017, during a joint press conference with the president of Finland, Trump took a question from OAN\u2019s White House correspondent and said: \u201cI want to congratulate you on the network. It\u2019s a great network.\u201d In June 2018, at a press conference in Singapore, he said: \u201cThank you for the nice way you treat us. We appreciate it. Really, it\u2019s very good. It\u2019s really beautiful what you do.\u201d The president has also mentioned OAN 25 times on Twitter since October 2015, including seven tweets in March, April and May. The most recent: \u201cAlso, congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (\u201cthank you President Trump\u201d)!\u201d OAN secured a seat in the White House briefing room and its journalists are regularly called upon to ask questions at press conferences. Herring said: \u201cI\u2019ve instructed our reporters they can ask any question; it should be a meaningful question on behalf of the viewers. It shouldn\u2019t be to raise their profile or anything along that line and it must be asked in the most respectful manner.

I will make sure that justice is served, however long that takes.\u201d Thousands of miners from around the country picketed the plant on 18 June 1984 during the bitter, year-long strike that was ultimately defeated by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Conservative government and the state-owned National Coal Board. They were met by 6,000 police officers commanded by a South Yorkshire police assistant chief constable, and were subjected to a charge by mounted officers, with many hit by police on horses and on foot wielding their batons. Ninety-five miners were arrested, and 55 prosecuted for the offence of riot, which carried a potential life sentence in prison. The police withdrew the prosecution 48 days into the trial, after a succession of police officers were accused of lying and presenting false evidence, including the forgery of a signature on a statement.

The OTJC began its campaign for a full inquiry in 2012 after the Guardian and BBC highlighted the enduring lack of accountability for the Orgreave events.

Nobody is so unspeakably vulgar as to suggest any kind of quid pro quo. But if he wins, he will be legislating on matters of great interest to this company, from the tax affairs of its owners to the commercial conditions under which it operates. There is a minor uproar about all this, but people are largely resigned to the way things work in this country now. Besides, scandal has always miraculously slid off this particular politician without leaving a mark.</p> \n<p>This faraway country doesn\u2019t feel quite so far away any more. When Boris Johnson launched his leadership campaign, the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendopolis/status/1138913057273458688\" title=\"\">Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page</a> was an enormous picture of its star columnist over the headline \u201cIt\u2019s time to remember our duty to the people\u201d. The day after he romped into the lead in the first ballot of Conservative MPs, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-the-papers-48631732\" title=\"\">it trumpeted</a> the Johnson camp\u2019s call for half his rivals to abandon the race so it could be wrapped up more quickly. Close scrutiny by MPs, who know his weaknesses better than anyone else, is Johnson\u2019s biggest headache \u2013 so his strategy is to rush through this dangerous early stretch of the journey at top speed while giving away <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/14/jeremy-hunt-what-would-churchill-say-of-boris-johnson-hiding-away-tory-leadership\" title=\"\">as few hostages to fortune</a> as possible.</p> \n<p>The campaign message is that a Johnson victory is practically a done deal, so everyone should stop asking questions and leap aboard. It smacks both of avoiding scrutiny and taking supporters for granted, yet so far he enjoys the unflagging support of a newspaper read religiously by Tory members.</p> \n<p>In fairness to both Johnson and his employers, they\u2019re hardly the only ones blurring the already murky boundaries between politics and the media. Nigel Farage has a weekly phone-in show on the LBC radio station, providing him with publicity a new fringe party couldn\u2019t otherwise buy; he went <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/presenters/nigel-farage/nigel-farage-tells-lbc-what-the-eu-elections/\" title=\"\">off air during the European elections</a> to comply with Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting regulations but was back within days of the Brexit party topping the polls. We don\u2019t know yet what the editor of the London Evening Standard will make of what looks like a coming grudge match between Johnson and Farage. But as he worked alongside one of them before losing a referendum to them both, George Osborne should certainly have the inside track.</p> \n<p>Michael Gove doesn\u2019t have his own newspaper column any more, but fortunately his wife, Sarah Vine, does \u2013 and she was <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7129687/SARAH-VINE-opens-heart-Michael-Goves-cocaine-past.html\" title=\"\">on hand to explain</a> at length to Daily Mail readers why its revelation that her husband had snorted cocaine in the past wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounded. Up until Esther McVey was knocked out of the leadership race amid a public clash with some old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/jun/10/lorraine-kelly-and-esther-mcvey-share-awkward-tv-moment-video\" title=\"\">colleagues from breakfast telly</a>, three of the 10 hopefuls running for prime minister came up from the media. No doubt if he makes it to Downing Street Johnson will give up his side hustle. Who knows, he may still have enough ink in his blood to turn and cheerfully bite the hand that fed him. But that doesn\u2019t solve the bigger problem that politics and journalism have become unhealthily intertwined.</p> \n<p>In any leadership contest, British newspapers will pick a horse and champion it, sometimes to the extent of practically sleeping in the stables. There has long been a revolving door between Fleet Street and Whitehall, with journalists morphing into spin doctors for parties of both left and right, while former Downing Street aides land newspaper columns in which to argue that their former bosses can\u2019t get it right without them. But we\u2019ve now reached a new level of incestuousness, and frankly it stinks. What on earth are voters \u2013 who already think Westminster is too cosy by half, that everybody in power seems to know everyone else, and that their interests overlap suspiciously often \u2013 to make of it? Yet the former Telegraph editor Charles Moore \u2013 authorised biographer of Margaret Thatcher, shooting chum of David Cameron, former employer of Johnson, speaking today as a guest on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u2013 had the chutzpah to suggest that the \u201cmainstream media establishment\u201d is somehow ganging up on plucky little Boris.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"81426640-e568-4567-9451-d2cd86b81ad4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/s4bVmVVSlLM?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kind of thing British people used to boggle at from afar, thinking smugly that it could never happen to us. We were nothing like Italy, where media mogul Silvio Berlusconi rose to power as the owner of three national TV channels and seedy stories about sex parties were pushed under the carpet. We weren\u2019t the US, where reporters were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/18/trump-greg-gianforte-assault-guardian-ben-jacobs\" title=\"\">physically threatened at rallies</a> while ferociously rightwing parts of the media helped steer voters behind Donald Trump. That looks pretty complacent after Johnson\u2019s campaign launch this week, when his <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opendemocracyuk/boris-brexit-carl-schmitt-and-what-journalists-can-do/\" title=\"\">supporters booed a journalist</a> for asking a difficult question \u2013 an ominously Trumpian habit.</p> \n<p>Whatever the failings of Britain\u2019s regulatory system, it does at least have well-worn mechanisms to deal with the threat of one media mogul acquiring too many news outlets, or broadcasters failing to remain impartial. But apart from professional pride, it\u2019s less obvious what stands in the way of more newspapers and commercial radio stations meekly handing the microphone to politicians who happen to look like winners. And the trouble with such rampant partisanship is it\u2019s infectious, pushing others to pick a side or risk falling behind those who do. That faraway country, where readers barely know who to trust, doesn\u2019t feel nearly far enough.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist</p>",

      "bodyText": "Imagine a faraway country, where an influential but controversial business with deep pockets hires itself a senior politician. It\u2019s all perfectly above board, of course. He gets \u00a3275,000 a year for a few hours\u2019 work a week, duly delivered to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, while harnessing the company\u2019s considerable soft power to support his personal and political ambitions. In due course, he runs for prime minister, with the company cheerleading all the way. Nobody is so unspeakably vulgar as to suggest any kind of quid pro quo. But if he wins, he will be legislating on matters of great interest to this company, from the tax affairs of its owners to the commercial conditions under which it operates. There is a minor uproar about all this, but people are largely resigned to the way things work in this country now. Besides, scandal has always miraculously slid off this particular politician without leaving a mark. This faraway country doesn\u2019t feel quite so far away any more. When Boris Johnson launched his leadership campaign, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s front page was an enormous picture of its star columnist over the headline \u201cIt\u2019s time to remember our duty to the people\u201d. The day after he romped into the lead in the first ballot of Conservative MPs, it trumpeted the Johnson camp\u2019s call for half his rivals to abandon the race so it could be wrapped up more quickly. Close scrutiny by MPs, who know his weaknesses better than anyone else, is Johnson\u2019s biggest headache \u2013 so his strategy is to rush through this dangerous early stretch of the journey at top speed while giving away as few hostages to fortune as possible. The campaign message is that a Johnson victory is practically a done deal, so everyone should stop asking questions and leap aboard. It smacks both of avoiding scrutiny and taking supporters for granted, yet so far he enjoys the unflagging support of a newspaper read religiously by Tory members. In fairness to both Johnson and his employers, they\u2019re hardly the only ones blurring the already murky boundaries between politics and the media. Nigel Farage has a weekly phone-in show on the LBC radio station, providing him with publicity a new fringe party couldn\u2019t otherwise buy; he went off air during the European elections to comply with Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting regulations but was back within days of the Brexit party topping the polls. We don\u2019t know yet what the editor of the London Evening Standard will make of what looks like a coming grudge match between Johnson and Farage. But as he worked alongside one of them before losing a referendum to them both, George Osborne should certainly have the inside track. Michael Gove doesn\u2019t have his own newspaper column any more, but fortunately his wife, Sarah Vine, does \u2013 and she was on hand to explain at length to Daily Mail readers why its revelation that her husband had snorted cocaine in the past wasn\u2019t as bad as it sounded. Up until Esther McVey was knocked out of the leadership race amid a public clash with some old colleagues from breakfast telly, three of the 10 hopefuls running for prime minister came up from the media. No doubt if he makes it to Downing Street Johnson will give up his side hustle. Who knows, he may still have enough ink in his blood to turn and cheerfully bite the hand that fed him. But that doesn\u2019t solve the bigger problem that politics and journalism have become unhealthily intertwined. In any leadership contest, British newspapers will pick a horse and champion it, sometimes to the extent of practically sleeping in the stables. There has long been a revolving door between Fleet Street and Whitehall, with journalists morphing into spin doctors for parties of both left and right, while former Downing Street aides land newspaper columns in which to argue that their former bosses can\u2019t get it right without them. But we\u2019ve now reached a new level of incestuousness, and frankly it stinks. What on earth are voters \u2013 who already think Westminster is too cosy by half, that everybody in power seems to know everyone else, and that their interests overlap suspiciously often \u2013 to make of it? Yet the former Telegraph editor Charles Moore \u2013 authorised biographer of Margaret Thatcher, shooting chum of David Cameron, former employer of Johnson, speaking today as a guest on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme \u2013 had the chutzpah to suggest that the \u201cmainstream media establishment\u201d is somehow ganging up on plucky little Boris. This is the kind of thing British people used to boggle at from afar, thinking smugly that it could never happen to us. We were nothing like Italy, where media mogul Silvio Berlusconi rose to power as the owner of three national TV channels and seedy stories about sex parties were pushed under the carpet. We weren\u2019t the US, where reporters were physically threatened at rallies while ferociously rightwing parts of the media helped steer voters behind Donald Trump. That looks pretty complacent after Johnson\u2019s campaign launch this week, when his supporters booed a journalist for asking a difficult question \u2013 an ominously Trumpian habit. Whatever the failings of Britain\u2019s regulatory system, it does at least have well-worn mechanisms to deal with the threat of one media mogul acquiring too many news outlets, or broadcasters failing to remain impartial. But apart from professional pride, it\u2019s less obvious what stands in the way of more newspapers and commercial radio stations meekly handing the microphone to politicians who happen to look like winners. And the trouble with such rampant partisanship is it\u2019s infectious, pushing others to pick a side or risk falling behind those who do. That faraway country, where readers barely know who to trust, doesn\u2019t feel nearly far enough. \u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist",

The franchise already employs the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/14/ben-foden-rugby-united-new-york-interview\">England full-back Ben Foden</a> and it has pulled off a significant coup by engaging the Frenchman for 2020, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/feb/13/major-league-rugby-season-two\">third season of Major League Rugby</a>. Bastareaud will earn the top MLR salary of $45,000. The deal is done, it\u2019s not a loan, and as <a href=\"https://www.pressreader.com/france/l-equipe/20190429/281956019201589\">L\u2019Equipe</a> put it, \u201cBig Basta \u00e0 Big Apple\u201d.

For me, I don\u2019t come here for a holiday. Not for me. I don\u2019t like when we say I come here for the break. I just want change. I play eight seasons in Toulon and every time it was the same. I want to change everything.\u201d</p> <p>A man will think that way when, as Bastareaud says, he has played \u201cmaybe 25 games\u201d of punishing pro rugby this season and yet \u201cit\u2019s not a lot\u201d next to previous workloads of \u201c37, 38 games\u201d for club and country.</p> <p>There are off-field factors too.

      "bodyText": "Mathieu Bastareaud arrives at the hotel on Lexington and 57th with a stiff neck, but it\u2019s not something to worry the French selectors. In Manhattan for the first time, he has simply spent most of his time looking up at buildings even bigger than he is. \u201cThis is maybe the city that is the most attractive in the world,\u201d says a man who started his career in Paris and has spent the last eight years in the Mediterranean port of Toulon. \u201cI know from the TV shows, CSI and Friends and things like that! I was very excited on the plane. I\u2019m very happy to be here.\u201d It seems so. Shortly after our conversation, the 6ft 1in, 300lb centre formally signs for Rugby United New York. The franchise already employs the England full-back Ben Foden and it has pulled off a significant coup by engaging the Frenchman for 2020, the third season of Major League Rugby. Bastareaud will earn the top MLR salary of $45,000. The deal is done, it\u2019s not a loan, and as L\u2019Equipe put it, \u201cBig Basta \u00e0 Big Apple\u201d. It is not guaranteed he will return to Toulon once he\u2019s done. When the move was announced in April, the Top 14 season remained to be completed. Toulon missed the playoffs so here Bastareaud is, a week before the French World Cup squad is named. Presuming he\u2019s picked for Japan, and presuming he avoids harm in \u201cpool of death\u201d games against England, Argentina, Tonga and USA and whatever might come after, he will return to New York in December. Speaking softly, the English he says he wants to improve a thousand times better than the Guardian\u2019s French, Bastareaud confirms that his motivation for the move was a break from the grind of Europe. \u201cI played 12 seasons in France,\u201d he says, \u201ceight in Toulon. I\u2019ve won everything I wanted to win and I wanted a new challenge. But for me the big challenge is going outside Europe, and to come here was a big opportunity because the franchise starts at the beginning, and I love that. \u201cThe Top 14 is a lot of players coming from New Zealand, South Africa\u201d \u2013 he confirms that he talked to the Sharks of Durban but says a move was not a real prospect \u2013 \u201cand the level is very high. For me, I don\u2019t come here for a holiday. Not for me. I don\u2019t like when we say I come here for the break. I just want change. I play eight seasons in Toulon and every time it was the same. I want to change everything.\u201d A man will think that way when, as Bastareaud says, he has played \u201cmaybe 25 games\u201d of punishing pro rugby this season and yet \u201cit\u2019s not a lot\u201d next to previous workloads of \u201c37, 38 games\u201d for club and country. There are off-field factors too. The impending arrival of his first child, a son, means he will bring a young family with him. They will have about a month to acclimatise before MLR kicks off in February. \u201cFor me it is important to play in another country, just for learning other cultures, because maybe in France we are \u2026\u201d He seeks a little translation help from Pierre Arnald, the former Stade Fran\u00e7ais executive who is now a RUNY investor. \u201cNot open-minded.\u201d For a writer from Brexit Britain who works in Trump\u2019s America, that\u2019s rather hard to accept. But never mind. As on the field, where he can leave defences scattered in twitching pieces, Bastareaud ploughs on. \u201cI think a lot of people don\u2019t understand why I come here,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think in one season they will change their opinion.\u201d As MLR concludes its second season, its newest signing has followed it as many fans do, via Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. He agrees the rugby is more open than in Europe, the ball moved more, more tries scored thanks in part to relatively raw defences. \u201cFor me it\u2019s good,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s just playing rugby, [the teams] do not think about pressure, maybe there is more [opportunity] for me to enjoy my rugby. No relegation too, of course. When you don\u2019t have relegation in your head I think it\u2019s better in terms of negative pressure from outside. You can just think about the rugby.\u201d He has talked to Samu Manoa, the American flanker who shone with Northampton, won European Cups in Toulon and then came back to the US via Cardiff. Manoa now plays for the Seattle Seawolves, the MLR champions who defend their title in San Diego on Sunday night. \u201cSamu has told me he will give me a special welcome,\u201d Bastareaud says, laughing, utterly delighted at the thought of apocalyptic confrontations to come. \u201cYes, yes! Every time we talk, he says, \u2018I\u2019m coming for you!\u2019\u201d That should wet the whistles of the MLR marketing men: Big Basta versus the Block Monsta, an old-world collision on rugby\u2019s new frontier. Another punishing aspect of MLR is the necessary travel: RUNY v Seattle, for example, means a near-6,000-mile round trip. Undaunted, Bastareaud professes to welcome such long hauls as a way to see \u201cnew cities and new cultures\u201d, although in fact they will be fewer in 2020 as the league splits into eastern and western conferences, with the addition of Boston, Washington and Atlanta. Home or away, he will still face rugby players from New Orleans, Houston, Austin and Colorado. And when RUNY get good ball going forward, those players will line up to meet him head-on. \u201cI have come to win,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I also come for a challenge with the American players, to have a mutual exchange, to learn from them but to give to them too. It\u2019s different from in Europe. I want to live like an American man!\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Hannah on Tom What were you hoping for? The love child of Louis Theroux, Mark Ronson and Richard Ayoade. Failing that, a plus one for my Cotton-Eye-Joe-themed 30th in a few months. First impressions? Friendly and welcoming. What did you talk about? Irish passports, Brexit, the name Barney, Hong Kong, expats, Wetherspoons, Black Mirror, our slinkier physiques at 20, asylum seekers\u2019 rights. Any awkward moments? When he asked if I had gone on a first date with him before (we hadn\u2019t). Good table manners? Impressive. Best thing about Tom? He seemed genuine and had a great ability to keep all glasses topped up. Would you introduce him to your friends? Yes, if the situation ever occurred, which is unlikely (although saying that, Trump\u2019s in power and I\u2019m getting grey hairs in my eyebrows, so anything\u2019s possible). I think they\u2019d like him. Describe Tom in three words Thoughtful, inquisitive, very good hair. What do you think he made of you? Full-on, with too many hand movements. Did you go on somewhere? No. And... did you kiss? No. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I would have happily gone for another drink and stayed out longer. Marks out of 10? A strong 7. Would you meet again? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on the cards. Tom on Hannah What were you hoping for? I was expecting an evening with a total stranger. This was not to be. First impressions? Oh God, we\u2019ve been on a Tinder date before... What did you talk about? How it\u2019s hard to be spontaneous in London, being kind to yourself, our supposed previous date. Any awkward moments? The discussion about whether we had been on a date before. She maintained we had not\u2026 I, having been on three Tinder dates ever, and with fairly vivid memories of all three, am certain that we had. Good table manners? Excellent. Best thing about Hannah? She came across as very genuine and happy in herself. Would you introduce her to your friends? I would. Describe Hannah in three words Funny, chatty, kind. What do you think she made of you? \u201cWho is this strange man, and why does he think we\u2019ve been on a date before?\u201d Did you go on somewhere? I was dead on my feet, so no. And... did you kiss? We did not. If you could change one thing about the evening, what would it be? I was exhausted on arrival, so I wish I\u2019d had a deeper sleep the night before. Marks out of 10? A solid 7. Would you meet again? Only as friends. \u2022 Hannah and Tom ate at The Albion, London E2. Fancy a blind date? Email blind.date@theguardian.com. If you\u2019re looking to meet someone like-minded, visit soulmates.theguardian.com",

The Iuventa was seized two years ago and charges are yet to be laid.</p> <p>Klemp, from Bonn in Germany, said she and her colleagues were preparing for a long, drawn out legal battle after recently being advised that prosectors were not going to drop the case and that it was likely to go to trial.</p> <p>Lawyers for the so-called Iuventa 10 have advised that the charges being considered carry a prison term of up to 20 years or a \u20ac15,000 fine for each person illegally brought to Italy.</p> <p>Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, called last year for Klemp to be arrested for her role in saving migrants and refugees and landing them on island of Lampedusa, bypassing the Italian government\u2019s closure of ports.</p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian ahead of a summer of fundraising to cover legal costs likely to be reach \u20ac500,000, Klemp said the rescuers were being targeted as part of a wider attempt to \u201cstigmatise refugees\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no way I am going to prison for saving people in distress,\u201d Klemp said. \u201cIt is the most ridiculous thing on so may different levels. And I will never accept anything else but acquittal.\u201d</p> <p>The Iuventa, a former fishing vessel, is believed to have saved 14,000 people in total during its time on the seas.

      "bodyText": "A captain of a search-and-rescue ship potentially facing up to 20 years in jail in connection with her role in saving 6,000 people from drowning in the Mediterranean has accused the EU of letting people die and the Italian authorities of \u201ccriminalising solidarity\u201d. Pia Klemp, 35, who skippered the Iuventa, a vessel run by an NGO, stands accused with nine others of aiding and abetting illegal migration in relation to their role in seeking to rescue people in danger after fleeing the Libyan coast for Europe. The evidence publicly produced by the Italian authorities for their claims that the rescuers collaborated with people smugglers was found wanting by academics at Goldsmith University last year. The Iuventa was seized two years ago and charges are yet to be laid. Klemp, from Bonn in Germany, said she and her colleagues were preparing for a long, drawn out legal battle after recently being advised that prosectors were not going to drop the case and that it was likely to go to trial. Lawyers for the so-called Iuventa 10 have advised that the charges being considered carry a prison term of up to 20 years or a \u20ac15,000 fine for each person illegally brought to Italy. Matteo Salvini, the far-right interior minister, called last year for Klemp to be arrested for her role in saving migrants and refugees and landing them on island of Lampedusa, bypassing the Italian government\u2019s closure of ports. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of a summer of fundraising to cover legal costs likely to be reach \u20ac500,000, Klemp said the rescuers were being targeted as part of a wider attempt to \u201cstigmatise refugees\u201d. \u201cThere is no way I am going to prison for saving people in distress,\u201d Klemp said. \u201cIt is the most ridiculous thing on so may different levels. And I will never accept anything else but acquittal.\u201d The Iuventa, a former fishing vessel, is believed to have saved 14,000 people in total during its time on the seas. Its crews worked closely with the Italian marine coordination centre for search and rescue. They would find distressed smuggler vessels and pass those saved on to European military ships or the Italian coastguard. Klemp skippered the boat on two missions in the summer of 2017, when on one day alone up to 3,800 people on smuggler boats in distress were saved. The Italian government railed against the large numbers of people being rescued and returned to their ports, and the lack of support from the EU\u2019s other 27 member states. A deal was agreed with the Libyan coastguard, a group of militia, in which the EU would fund their operations to find and return those in the Mediterranean to Libya. Amid the political change, in August 2017 the Iuventa was seized at the port of Lampedusa and phones and computers onboard were taken. It later transpired that the crew had been bugged and that informants had been placed on other rescue ships. It was claimed in official documents relating to the seizure that there was evidence that the rescuers had collaborated with smugglers to get their boats sent back to Libya after rescues, an allegation that has been strenuously denied. Klemp, who worked in marine conservation before joining the crew of the Iuventa, continued to be involved in rescue operations in a second boat until June last year when she was informed by lawyers that she risked pre-trial detention if found in Italian waters. Klemp said her experience on the Mediterranean made her determined to highlight the torment of those fleeing Libya and the culpability of the EU and the Italian government. She said: \u201cWe had a rescue where we could only try to bring a two-year-old boy back to life \u2013 we didn\u2019t manage to. The Libyan coastguard had intercepted the refugees and did everything they could to forcibly take them back to Libya. They damaged the refugee boats and a lot of people were left in water. \u201cItalian and French warships did not assist with the rescue. Some 40 people got taken back to Libya, 40 drowned and we had 60 on our ship including this little boy who we had to keep in our freezer for several days. \u201cEurope didn\u2019t give us a port of safety so we had to bob up and down in international waters for several days with that boy in the freezer, with his mother onboard, and you were really wondering what you are going to tell that woman whose child is in your freezer about the Nobel peace prize-winning European Union.\u201d On Wednesday this week, Libyan authorities allocated Tripoli as a safe port for the disembarkment of 52 people rescued by Sea-Watch, an NGO. Sea-Watch declined the offer and headed to Lampedusa with the rescued onboard. \u201cIf the illegal NGO ship disobeys, keeping the lives of the immigrants at risk, they will answer for it fully,\u2019\u2019 said Salvini, who has repeatedly declared Italian waters closed to NGO rescue vessels.",

Meanwhile it\u2019s yet another birdie for Matt Wallace, who sends his tee shot at 7 to ten feet and converts. He moves to -4 and is encouraged by some lairy frat boys either to throw his ball to them, or try to hit something. It\u2019s not clear which. He flings it towards them.

After all he\u2019s been through, it\u2019d be a lovely bittersweet story if he could - first things first - at least make the cut on debut.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s the end of a very eventful second round. Gary Woodland takes a two-shot lead into the weekend, after a flawless 65. Join me for Moving Day tomorrow. Nighty night! -9: Woodland -7: Rose -6: Oosthuizen -5: Wise, McIlroy -4: Reavie, Hadley, Kuchar, Koepka, Wallace -3: Stenson, Scott, Piercy, Rahm, Z Johnson, McDowell, Garcia, Schauffele Oosthuizen whips a 9-iron into the heart of 18. He\u2019ll have two putts from distance for par and an eventful round of 70. And par five it is. That was his first par on the back nine, and only his second in the last 14 holes! Absurd. He\u2019s nicely placed at the halfway stage at -6. Par for Matt Wallace at 9, and he\u2019s signing for an excellent 68. Xander Schauffele pars it too, though he won\u2019t be so happy with his 73. They\u2019re -4 and -3 respectively. Gary Woodland rakes a 50-foot birdie putt across the 9th and in! A perfectly judged gentle right-to-left slider! He raises one arm in the air, fist clenched, and that\u2019s a 65 to go alongside yesterday\u2019s 69. He\u2019s got himself a two-shot lead going into the weekend ... unless Louis Oosthuizen eagles the last, which he\u2019s unlikely to do now having laid up. -9: Woodland (F) -7: Rose (F) -6: Oosthuizen (17) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (F) Sergio\u2019s eagle effort is always missing on the left. But that\u2019s a birdie that would have seemed a pipe dream when his tee shot was seemingly sailing off into the blue yonder. He\u2019s converted that fortunate break into a 70, to go with yesterday\u2019s 69. He\u2019s -3 and far from out of it. Meanwhile his playing partner Tommy Fleetwood drains a bogey putt from the fringe. A huge cheer for this very popular player, because it means he\u2019s limited the damage and almost certainly made the weekend! He\u2019s +2, and the projected cut will save everyone on that mark. Sergio sets about taking full advantage of that incredible stroke of good fortune. He creams a fairway wood into the front of the green, and he\u2019ll have a 15-foot look at eagle. Woodland takes up half of California launching his ball into the 9th green from the depths of that monster divot. What power! Brooks Koepka would be proud of that. And a bogey for Schauffele at 8. He slips back to -3. It\u2019s just not been his day. Woodland crashes a monster drive down 9. It\u2019s perfect, apart from the small detail of his ball resting in a large divot. Better luck off the tee for Sergio on 18, as he pulls a 3-wood towards the ocean, only to see it take a wild bounce off the edge of the fairway and kick back towards safety. Depending on what he makes here, that could be a pivotal moment in his US Open bid. And Oosthuizen still hasn\u2019t made par on the back nine, firing a 5-iron over the flag at 17, then rolling in the 15-footer coming back! He\u2019s -6. Bogey for Oosthuizen on 16, and he\u2019s still not made par on the back nine. He\u2019s -5 again. Sergio drops one on 17 and he slips to -2. Meanwhile G-Mac, DJ and Lefty are all on the 18th in regulation. But nobody can make a birdie from distance. G-Mac signs for a 70; he\u2019s -3. DJ puts his name to a 69 that should have been several shots better, if it wasn\u2019t for that pesky putter. He\u2019s -2. And Lefty finishes with a street-fighting 69; he\u2019s -1. Woodland doesn\u2019t have too tricky a lie. But there\u2019s not a lot of green to play with, and his ball trundles past the cup and onto the fringe at the back. It rolls back a little ... and then he guides in the left-to-right 15-foot curler for an exceptional scramble! A little fortunate that his second didn\u2019t fly over the cliff edge, of course, but he\u2019s earned that bit of luck, and his card remains clean. He remains one in the lead at -8. A huge break for Woodland on 8. He slices his second off to the right, and toys with the hazard. Any more juice on the shot, and that was away down the cliff. But it snags in the rough to the right of the bunker. That\u2019s still going to be quite a test. Zach Johnson signs for a 69; the erstwhile Masters and Open champ is -3, and is the sort of guy who could easily grind out a US Open. Meanwhile it\u2019s yet another birdie for Matt Wallace, who sends his tee shot at 7 to ten feet and converts. He moves to -4 and is encouraged by some lairy frat boys either to throw his ball to them, or try to hit something. It\u2019s not clear which. He flings it towards them. There\u2019s a thud, at which point he laughs and shouts \u201cfucking hell!\u201d We only see Wallace. There\u2019s nothing else to go on. It would make for a fine test on a creative writing course. A lovely wedge into 15 by Louis Oosthuizen. It leaves a straight ten-foot putt for birdie, and in it goes. He\u2019s not made a par since the turn! He\u2019s -6 again. And the all-new simmered-down Matt Wallace makes another birdie, this time at the par-five 6th, and he\u2019s back to -3. -8: Woodland (16*) -7: Rose (F) -6: Oosthuizen (15) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (F) A lovely 4-iron into 17 by G-Mac. Two putts from 30 feet and that\u2019s a difficult hole navigated in par. He\u2019s -3. Then DJ finally makes a birdie putt! Naturally, it\u2019s one of the harder one\u2019s he\u2019s faced today, a tricky left-to-right downhill slider, but he\u2019s kept his cool, refused to get flustered, and now he\u2019s got his reward. He\u2019s -2. Bogey for Lefty, though, the result of sending his tee shot into the wrong part of the huge hourglass green. Back on 7, Woodland sends a tee shot into the short par-three to a similar distance. No interest in taking on the pin with all that trouble just behind it. He can\u2019t quite drain the birdie putt, but he remains in the lead at -8. Not a blemish on his card today, and just two holes to go. McIlroy faces a 30-foot birdie attempt from just off the front of 18. He races it four feet past the hole. Still work to do for par. But in it goes. He\u2019ll feel a little deflated after events at 13 and 14, but it\u2019s still a 69, and he\u2019s right in this tournament, without having to worry about the pressure of front-running. Rahm\u2019s next, with his 40-foot eagle attempt. A huge left-to-right curl, but he doesn\u2019t give it enough and it\u2019s always slipping by on the low side. But he\u2019ll make birdie and sign for a one-under 70. That\u2019s a result after his woeful start to the round. Rory\u2019s -5, Rahm\u2019s -3. Woodland\u2019s eagle putt doesn\u2019t look like dropping, but no matter. He taps in for birdie, and takes sole ownership of the lead. -8: Woodland (15*) -7: Rose (F) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (17), Oosthuizen (14) A stunning 3-iron fired straight into 18 by Jon Rahm. He\u2019s gone under the radar today, after those bogeys at 1, 3 and 6, but he\u2019s bounced back with birdies at 7, 9 and 13. Now he\u2019s got an eagle putt from 30 feet, which would instantly turn a garden-variety day into a banner one. Rory\u2019s wedge in however is no good, spinning back off the front. Par most likely when a birdie was desirable. And a birdie for Oosthuizen on 14, and he\u2019s back to -5. Gary Woodland is threatening to take charge here. He smashes a big drive down 6, then lashes an iron from 250 yards into the heart of the green. One of those that felt so good, he\u2019s walking after it the second he\u2019s completed his follow-through. He\u2019s pin high, with a 20-footer across the green for an eagle and a two-shot lead. Elsewhere McIlroy takes his medicine and bashes back out onto the 18th fairway. Some big moments going into the weekend coming up right here. McIlroy\u2019s driver has let him down on more than one occasion today, and on 18 he sends his tee shot sailing wide right of the big tree. At least he\u2019s not wet, and the decision about laying up or not has been taken out of his hands. He\u2019s in thick rough. \u201cSame again!\u201d is his plaintive cry. Birdie for the amateur Brandon Wu at 4, a McIlroyesque response to a double bogey at 2 and bogey at 3. He\u2019s still very nicely placed at -2. Sergio nearly drains a birdie putt from off the front at 14, but it somehow lips out just as it looked like surely dropping. He stays at -3. Elsewhere, Matt Wallace calmed himself down and lifted a careful wedge to four feet, cleaning up for bounce-back birdie. He\u2019s -2 again. It\u2019s back-to-back bogeys for Oosthuizen, the latest at 13. And Rory can\u2019t roll in his putt on 17, the ball always breaking to the right. -7: Rose (F), Woodland (14*) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (17) Gary Woodland joins Justin Rose in the lead at -7! His tee shot into 5 isn\u2019t the greatest, but it is dead in the middle of the green, and he\u2019s got a chance to tickle one in from 20 feet. He judges it perfectly! Not so perfect is Mickelson\u2019s chip from the edge of 15. Almost a whiff, his ball, sitting up on the cabbage, only just topples onto the green, three feet away. He can\u2019t make the par putt, and slips back to -2. G-Mac hits an eight-foot birdie attempt too hard, and it horseshoes out. He\u2019s -3. Then DJ misses yet another birdie putt, a seven-footer slipping by on the right. This is farcical. He\u2019s had birdie chance after birdie chance, but nothing\u2019s dropped! He\u2019s -1. McIlroy\u2019s tee shot at the iconic 17th. It\u2019s not quite the Golden Bear in 1972, but it is very good. Straight at the flag, and he\u2019ll have a look at a third birdie in a row from eight feet. Another birdie for McIlroy, who is repairing his round apace! His second into 16 doesn\u2019t bite and spin back as he\u2019d like, which means the ball rolls into the fringe at the back. But he strokes home a 17-foot left-to-right curler, and pumps the air with great feeling! His last six holes: 3-3-5-7-3-3. What he\u2019d give to have 13 and 14 again. -7: Rose (F) -6: Woodland (13*) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (16), Oosthuizen (12) G-Mac sends his third at 14 over the back. He gets relief from the grandstand, and very nearly gets up and down from the drop zone, but the mistake was the approach. It\u2019s a six and he\u2019s heading backwards. He\u2019s -3 and beginning to look a little frustrated, so much good work undone in the last four holes. Meanwhile yet another birdie putt for DJ goes sailing by. He\u2019s -1, but really should be much further up the rankings. But his flat stick is stone cold. However another birdie for Mickelson, his sixth today, and he\u2019s -3. This couldn\u2019t be on, could it? Not entirely sure I\u2019ll be able to cope if the great entertainer\u2019s in the mix for a much-deserved career slam on Sunday afternoon. Just warning you. Louis Oosthuizen has made one par in the last eight holes. He\u2019s been yo-yoing this way and that. This time it\u2019s a bogey at 12, following a failure to find the putting surface from the tee. He\u2019s -5. Gary Woodland stays at -6 after doing well to get up and down from the bank at the back of 4. Meanwhile Sergio leaves a birdie putt at 13 a couple of inches short. He\u2019s done that a few times today, failing to get the speed of these greens. It\u2019s been a tough grind for Xander Schauffele since those bogeys at 13 and 14. But he\u2019s finally moving in the right direction again, taking advantage of a friendly bounce off the bank to the right of the 3rd. The ball kicks left, having had a fair bit of speed removed from it by the cushion of rough, and stops six feet short. He rolls in for birdie that takes him back to -4. Meanwhile all of Matt Wallace\u2019s momentum is lost, hitting two weak chips into 2 and then 3, both leading to needless bogeys. He flings his putter down with great intensity after the second bogey, a full-scale meltdown. He\u2019ll do well to calm down after that miserable show. McIlroy makes his birdie putt at 15. That\u2019s a stunning response to a very worrying situation; plenty of his fans will have feared the worst after his drive found a bunker following bogey and a double-bogey seven. But that\u2019s got him back on the horse. He\u2019s -4. Meanwhile Woodland\u2019s second into 4 takes a hot bounce and buries itself into the thick nonsense at the back. Birdie for Oosthuizen at 11, taking advantage of a big stroke of luck. His approach looked like snagging on a rough-covered bank, but his ball kicked abruptly left and ended up six feet from the flag. If he was unfortunate earlier when his approach to 8 stayed on the bank, inches from perfection, this is payback time. He returns to a share of second at -6. Meanwhile McIlroy arrests his slide in sensational fashion. He clips a 9-iron off the sand and arrows his ball straight at the flag. It comes to a screeching halt six feet short, and he\u2019ll have a chance to start repairing some of the damage of the previous two holes immediately. Lefty rattles a 35-foot birdie putt up the 13th green and into the cup! One of those that was always going to get swallowed up by the hole from the second it left the face of the flat stick! He\u2019s back to -2 and simply refusing to let his career-slam dream die. G-Mac\u2019s effort from 10 feet shaves the high side, but he remains at -4. Par for DJ as well, as he lets another birdie chance slip by. He stays at -1. But McIlroy\u2019s round is threatening to totally unravel, as he sends his drive at 15 into sand down the left. The highly regarded amateur Brandon Wu continues to rip the place up. Having played the harder back nine in 33, he\u2019s started working his way through the front with birdie at 1. He\u2019s -4 for both his round and the tournament. A local lad doing extremely well. Meanwhile it\u2019s three shots gone in two holes for Rory McIlroy, who can\u2019t knock in his bogey putt on 14. He leaves the scene of the par-five having run up seven. He clatters down the standings to -3. If Rory\u2019s wedge into 14 was a bad mistake, this next chip is a potential catastrophe. He flips weakly into the air and dumps his fourth into the big bunker. He\u2019ll be doing well to get up and down for a bogey six. He whips out to eight feet, but this is a big putt coming up. McIlroy\u2019s wedge into 14 is dismal. He lifts it high into the air, the ball biting on the green and spinning hysterically back off the false front. He\u2019s left with a tricky chip over a bunker, and not much in the way of green to play with. That\u2019s a bad mistake. Meanwhile two birdies in four holes for Li Haotong, at 2 and 4, and he\u2019s putting together a lovely round here. Four under today, and -4 for the tournament as well. With the two cute par threes to come! DJ misses another fine birdie chance. A straight 13-footer on the par-three 12th slips by the left of the cup. And one goes begging on 2, where Gary Woodland sticks his approach to 12 feet, but can\u2019t guide in the left-to-right curler. A putt missed at 10, meanwhile, as Louis Oosthuizen drops another. And while we\u2019re on this subject, Phil misses another short one, this time at 12, and he\u2019s back down to -1. Rickie Fowler continues to suffer. Bogey at 1, and he\u2019s currently four over for his round. Just not at the races today. He\u2019s currently -1, just three shots above the projected cut at +2. Having started the day harbouring dreams of glory, it\u2019s a sad state of affairs. Meanwhile G-Mac whips a gorgeous shot out of the bunker at the front of 12, nearly holing it, but happy to escape with his par. And on the par-five 14th, McIlroy\u2019s drive slips into the thick stuff down the left, meaning he\u2019s got to lay up as opposed to going for it. He lays up and will be wedging in from 100 yards or so. Matt Wallace is coming of age in the majors. The 29-year-old Englishman finished the recent PGA in a tie for third, and now he\u2019s taking a proper tilt at the US Open. He\u2019s just made back-to-back birdies at 18 and 1, and he\u2019s -3 with plenty of birdie opportunities on the front nine to come. Jon Rahm rolls a 30-foot birdie effort into the cup at 13. He\u2019s only five behind at -2. Fellow big hitter Dustin Johnson should be joining him there, but he doesn\u2019t give a four-foot birdie putt enough on the high side, and it dies away. Par. He remains at -1. And McIlroy can\u2019t make his par saver on 13. -7: Rose (F) -6: Woodland (10*), Oosthuizen (9) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (13) Birdie for Gary Woodland at 1. He joins McIlroy in second place at -6 ... but he might not have Rory for company in a minute, as the 2011 champ has plugged his approach to 13 in sand, and not gone particularly close with the splash out. Meanwhile on 11, G-Mac drops back to -4, the result of sending his tee shot into the thick stuff on the right. Carlos Ortiz creams his second shot into the par-five 6th. He lands it on the front of the green, his ball rolling up to ten inches or so. Less than a foot from an albatross! A tap-in for eagle. The 28-year-old Mexican has only competed in one major before, missing the cut in the US Open at Oakmont in 2016. He\u2019s got a fair chance of making this one now, though. He\u2019s currently got two holes left to play, and he\u2019s -2 for the tournament. Louis Oosthuizen chipped in from the bunker guarding the front of 9 yesterday. He very nearly does it again today, but will be more than happy to escape with par. He should aim there tomorrow and Sunday. A distinctly Ulster feel to the US Open leader board, so much so that you\u2019d wish it was being read out by Julian Simmons. -7: Rose (F) -6: McIlroy (12), Oosthuizen (9) -5: Wise (F), McDowell (10), Woodland (9*) Pars That Feel Like Birdies (No1 in an occasional series): Rory McIlroy at the par-three 12th. His tee shot finds a deep bunker and with not too much in the way of green to play with, it\u2019s all he can do to send his second 20 feet past the flag. No matter! He races in the par saver, and that keeps him within a shot of Justin Rose. He punches the air modestly, knowing how precious every shot can be in the chase of a major championship ... especially a US Open. Graeme McDowell is one inch away from holing out from 199 yards on 10! That\u2019s a kick-in birdie that\u2019ll take him to -5, just two shots off the lead. His playing partner DJ eases a 7-iron to six feet, a shot that would normally send the crowd wild, but it\u2019s nothing compared to G-Mac\u2019s astonishing approach. Lefty\u2019s second is bang average, but he\u2019s not to be denied, rattling in a 30-footer to get the gallery going. He\u2019s -2 again. And finally DJ converts to rise to -1. Three birdies at 10! You\u2019ll not see many groups doing that again in the US Open at Pebble Beach. It\u2019s all change near the top! Louis Oosthuizen slips out of the lead after failing to get up and down from thick rough at the front of the green. He\u2019s unfortunate, because his approach was just a few feet short of perfection. Gary Woodland very nearly drains a birdie putt from Matt Kuchar Country at the back of 18, but it\u2019s just par for a player who is enjoying a mid-career boost, having recently recorded a couple of top-ten finishes at the PGA. Good news for Rory though: he curls in a 12-footer on 11, and he\u2019s just a shot off the lead! This is hotting up nicely. -7: Rose (F) -6: McIlroy (11), Oosthuizen (8) -5: Wise (F), Woodland (9*) Scott Piercy is going the wrong way. Bogey at 18 followed by another at 2, and he\u2019s over par for his round today and -3 overall. Fowler tries his best to get up and down from the drop zone at 18 but that\u2019s another shot gone; he\u2019s -2. Meanwhile on 9 Mickelson takes his drop then trundles a chip 15 feet past the flag. He does extremely well to steer in a left-to-right curler to limit the damage to bogey. He slips to -1, but that could have been a whole lot worse. And birdie for DJ, his second in four holes, and he\u2019s turning in level-par 35. He\u2019s level for the tournament as well. Oh Phil! He tugs his second shot at 9, from the centre of the fairway, over the edge running down the right of the hole. That\u2019s almost certainly going to put the kibosh on his momentum. Meanwhile par for McIlroy at 10. He\u2019d sent his drive into sand down the left, but creamed his second to 15 feet. The birdie putt nearly dropped, only to horseshoe out at the last. Slightly frustrating, but it looks like on balance he\u2019ll take it. He wanders off happy enough, still just a couple behind the leading pair. \u201cLike Mickelson at the US Open and Lee Trevino at the Masters, some other things just aren\u2019t meant to be,\u201d suggests Simon McMahon, before trotting out a few more examples. \u201cSafe passage for Scotland through a World Cup group stage. Tim Henman and the Wimbledon final. Jimmy White and the World Snooker Championship. Buffalo Bills and the Super Bowl. Socks and sandals. Whisky with mixer. Peanut butter and jelly.\u201d Rickie Fowler decides to force things on 18. Bad idea. He crashes a big drive down the track, then sends a huge hook into the Pacific. He looks on the verge of tears, poor chap, as he sees his latest bid for a major hit the rocks ... literally, his ball bouncing all over the beach en route to the briny. But there\u2019s plenty of time to salvage the situation. Things change quickly in championship golf. Exhibit A: Louis Oosthuizen, who follows his bogey at 5 with back-to-back birdies at 6 and 7, the latter after clipping his wedge to tap-in distance, one of the shots of the week so far. Suddenly the 2015 runner-up is tied for the lead! -7: Rose (F), Oosthuizen (7) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (9), Woodland (8*) G-Mac\u2019s run of birdies comes to an end at 8. But he\u2019s happy enough, getting up and down having left himself well short of the green in two. Meanwhile on the practice area, Jordan Spieth and his caddie and pal Michael Greller appear to be having some sort of clear-the-air discussion. A casual sit-down pow-wow that has reportedly been going on for some time. They look happy and relaxed enough when they eventually get up and amble off. There\u2019s nice. All friends again, we hope, after that moment on 18 yesterday. Sergio spins his tee shot at 7 to five feet, and makes no mistake with the putt. He\u2019s suddenly just three off the lead at -4. Li Haotong curls in a 20-footer on 18 to complete the back nine in 33 strokes: he\u2019s -3. And the 22-year-old Californian amateur Brandon Wu chips in from the fairway at 15! A birdie, his third of the day already after picking up strokes at 10 and 14. He\u2019s -3. With the equally sensational Viktor Hovland already home and hosed at level par, the race for low amateur over the weekend is going to be worth the price of admission on its own. Rickie Fowler is desperate for his maiden major. But he\u2019s going in the wrong direction this afternoon. A bogey at 14, and now another at 17 after sending his tee shot into sand. He slips to -3, and will be hoping his fortunes change on the slightly easier front nine. A garden-variety par for McIlroy at 9, and he\u2019s turning in 33 strokes. Meanwhile his partner Jon Rahm is beginning to piece his round back together after that appalling start. The damage of bogeys at 1, 3 and 6 has been almost repaired by birdies at 7 and now 9, where he chips in from the fringe at the back, a good 40 feet away. He\u2019s back to -1. Having dropped a stroke at 5, Sergio picks it straight back up at the par-five 6th. Almost a carbon copy of G-Mac\u2019s flop from a tight spot to the left of the green. He\u2019s -3. Speaking of the 2010 champion, McDowell rolls in his birdie putt on 7 and that\u2019s four in a row! This is astonishing! Gary Woodland\u2019s going along well, too, with birdies at 12 and 16, and the leader board is beginning to look very interesting indeed! -7: Rose (F) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (8), Woodland (7*), Oosthuizen (5) -4: Reavie (F), Hadley (F), Kuchar (F), Koepka (F), Fowler (7*), McDowell (7) Bogey for Louis Oosthuizen at the par-three 5th. Missing the green a no-no. Meanwhile back-to-back birdies for Li Haotong, who you may remember shooting a final-day 63 at Birkdale in the 2017 Open to snatch third spot from nowhere. The 23-year-old Chinese prodigy has been steady if not so spectacular in the majors since, but he\u2019s already got a couple of wins on the European Tour under his belt, and another big performance in a major is surely just a matter of time. Well, how about now? Birds at 14 and 15 spring him up to -2 after yesterday\u2019s 71. A fine up and down for McIlroy at 8. He can\u2019t realistically stop his downhill chip from the thick stuff anywhere near the hole, but does pretty well to stay within ten feet. He rolls in the saver for a par that\u2019ll feel like a birdie. He remains at -5, just two off the lead. And his compatriot G-Mac is flying, screeching a wedge at the short par-three 7th to ten feet. He\u2019s not going to make four birdies in a row, is he? It\u2019s been a stuttering start by Dustin Johnson. Nothing like that triple/double/bogey start to his catastrophic collapse on Sunday in 2010. But bogeys at 3 and 4 have him teetering on the edge of the projected cut at +2. He\u2019s on the fringe of the par-five 6th in two, but he\u2019ll be doing well to take two putts from 65 feet. So of course he nearly drains the monster eagle effort. Birdie will do. And it\u2019s all happening in this final group, because G-Mac makes it three birdies on the bounce after flipping a cute wedge from tight stuff to four feet, while Mickelson chips in for his third birdie in five holes! Suddenly that career slam doesn\u2019t look such a pipe dream, huh. DJ\u2019s +1, Lefty is -2, G-Mac -3. Thanks Rob. The wind looks to have dried the greens out a bit, and so they\u2019re slightly harder to hold. McIlroy\u2019s second into 8 takes a hard bounce off the green and disappears into the mulch at the back. He leans over as if in pain. A tricky up and down if he wants to keep just a couple off Rose\u2019s lead. And it\u2019s back-to-back bogeys for Xander Schauffele, at 13 and now 14. He slips to -3. -7: Rose (F) -6: Oosthuizen (4) -5: Wise (F), McIlroy (7) Graeme McDowell dropped shots at 2 and 3 and things were looking bleak for the Irishman, but his response has been impressive. A birdie at 4 was crucial for his confidence and on the par three sixth he drifts in a beautiful long putt to return to -2. Not to be outdone, McIlroy takes up the baton on 7, arrowing his tee shot close to the hole. Rahm is having an awful time and shanks a horrible shot but it takes a remarkable bounce ahead of the green and rolls up alongside McIlroy\u2019s. The Spaniard then screams in the birdie putt, on the back of Leishman\u2019s successful attempt, before McIlroy follows him in to make it a clean sweep of birdies for the group. McIlroy is now just two off the lead. And that\u2019s all from me. Welcome back Scott \u2026 Rickie Fowler\u2019s driving and iron game has been superb today but he just cannot hole a putt. Another one slides by on 14 to earn him a frustrating six and with that he slips back to -4, three off Rose in the lead. If some of these had dropped for Rickie today he would have been the man in charge of this tournament right now, instead he\u2019s in the chasing pack and needing a fine end to his round to lift his spirits. Dustin Johnson looks like he is in the Pacific Ocean on 4 but his ball somehow stops short of the water. A decent third shot leaves him a long par putt but he can\u2019t complete the great escape and drops to +2. Mickelson ends his run of birdies with a feeble attempt while Oosthuizen leaves a long birdie attempt short on 2 to stay a shot off the lead. A brilliant two on 12 from Matt Wallace takes him to -2. Justin Rose remains the leader in the clubhouse on -7 and seems in confident mood as he chats about his second round \u2026 I started off much like yesterday, hit a couple of nice shots into the first and then had to scramble a bit. Settled into the round and felt like i got some nice momentum going but unfortunately my round went a little flat. The finish was petty tricky but I felt like I held it together and it was a decent round. If you\u2019re gonna win a golf tournament you\u2019ve got to be playing well. Dustin Johnson is all over the place and must be beginning to worry about being here for the weekend. A messy bogey at 3 takes him to +1 after a lacklustre 71 yesterday and he needs to get things going soon. It can\u2019t help that Mickelson is heading the other way. A huge cheer greets Lefty\u2019s fine approach at 3 and he rolls in the putt for his second birdie in a row. He is up to -1. McIloy attacks 4 with gusto and gets his reward. A 3-wood almost makes the green on the par 4 hole and a delightful chip and assured putt bring him his first birdie of the day. He\u2019s -4 now. Thanks Scott, and hello all. The first thing I can tell you is Justin Rose\u2019s two-shot lead is a two-shot lead no more. The man on his own in second is Louis Oosthuizen, who has just rolled in a birdie putt at the first hole to go to -6 and confirm himself as a contender here at Pebble Beach after his fine 66 yesterday. The 2010 Open champions is definitely one to watch. Of course, the flip side to Mickelson\u2019s wild driving is his ability to make outrageous escapes. From the filth down the left of 2, he whips a stunning second to four feet. In goes the putt, and he\u2019s level par again. A pipe dream, was that? Meanwhile his partner G-Mac cards his first bogey of the week and slips to -1. And an opening birdie for Sergio at 1; he\u2019s -3. With that, I\u2019m off to be fed and watered. See you soon, but in the meantime, the one and only Rob Bleaney will be your guide. McIlroy\u2019s not going to win this US Open if he keeps giving up good chances with the flat stick. It\u2019s all good and well cutting the corner at the dogleg par-four 3rd, skelping a 3-wood 300 yards, only to send a sand wedge close then miss the putt. Not disastrous, but he really should be two under for his round today. As it is, he stays at -3. Chances at the US Open come at a premium. Mickelson sprays his tee shot at 2 so far left that it avoids the thickest rough. Is there any wonder he\u2019s never won a US Open? Some things just aren\u2019t meant to be, like Lee Trevino at the Masters. Birdie meanwhile for Bryson DeChambeau at 2 after going close with his approach; he\u2019s -3. DJ sends his second at 1 to 14 feet, but like McIlroy before him, a huge right-to-left swing on the putt denies him birdie. Mickelson pulls a birdie putt of similar length, but far straighter, wide right of the cup. Finally it\u2019s G-Mac, the only player in the field yet to make a bogey this week. That dreadful opening shot should have put an end to that proud boast, but he powers his second to the front of the green and then, after hitting a rather bobbly putt to ten feet, guides in the saver. A modest air-punch to celebrate his gritty par. He remains at -2; DJ is level par while Mickelson is +1. McIlroy passes up a great chance for birdie at 2 after sending his approach to six feet. He pulls the putt, and remains at -3. Rahm also misses a birdie putt from an almost identical spot, having sent a lovely second in from the sand. Leishman does well to scramble par again. Up on 10, Jason Day starts with a double-bogey six after visiting the beach. The 2015 PGA winner is +1. Par for Rickie Fowler, who remains two off Justin Rose\u2019s lead at -5. Here comes Lefty, continuing his latest bid to complete the career slam. To be perfectly frank, landing that elusive US Open looks something of a pipe dream. Partly because he now has to break the record set by Julius Boros, who won the 1968 PGA at 48 years of age; Mickelson will be 49 on Sunday. But mainly because he shot 72 yesterday. Still, he\u2019s not going to die wondering, and cracks his opening tee shot down the middle of 1. So does DJ, but the third member of the group, the 2010 conqueror of Pebble Beach, Graeme McDowell, wangs his into deep filth down the left. God speed, everyone. McIlroy sends his second at 1 over the flag, but can\u2019t guide in a birdie putt from 15 feet with a mammoth right-to-left break. Par will suffice, especially as Rahm is punished for missing the fairway and drops immediately back to -1. Leishman got away with his errant tee shot, making par, but he\u2019s just sent a big slice into the thick rubbish down the right of 2. McIlroy pumps big down the middle of the long par-four. Finally Rahm finds a bunker down the right. More trouble awaits for Rory\u2019s partners. What Pebble Beach gives, Pebble Beach takes away. Sepp Straka nearly made eagle after that spectacular drive on 4. Now he tugs his tee shot at the par-five 5th into deep rough. He chips up well enough to seven feet, but runs the par putt a similar distance past, and that\u2019s a really miserable double bogey. As quick as a flash, he\u2019s back to where he started the day: -3. Here comes Rory! His playing partners Jon Rahm (-2) and Marc Leishman (-2) both send their tee shots into the thick stuff down the right of 1. McIlroy (-3) is making no such mistake, clattering a driving iron down the centre. Birdie meanwhile for Scott Piercy, at 13; the 40-year-old from Vegas, who tied for second at Oakmont in 2016, picks up a stroke at 13 to join the pack in second place. A monster putt! And finally Justin Rose, who makes a drama-free par. He ends the day with a 70 that could have been better ... but could have been a whole lot worse had his putter not been working. With the wind picking up a little for the afternoon starters, and the greens getting a little harder, he could be in very good nick by the end of the day. A two-putt birdie for Sepp Straka on 4, by the way; his eagle putt never looked like dropping, but that\u2019s thoroughly deserved after such a cracking drive. -7: Rose (F) -5: Wise (F), Straka (4), Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Reavie (F), Hadley (F), Kuchar (F), Koepka (F), Piercy (3*) -3: Stenson (F), Scott (F), McIlroy, Woodland Ian Poulter won\u2019t be here this weekend after carding a second 73. A round that included a quadruple-bogey eight at the 3rd. But he leaves with a little something to remember: a third shot holed out from deep rough, 70 yards out to the left of 9. Coming behind, the group of Woods, Rose and Spieth. Bogey for Spieth, the result of missing the green to the left with his approach. But that\u2019s a 69 that brings him into the periphery of things at -1. Tiger, who sent a sensational third to seven feet from Poulter Territory, hits a timid par putt and slips to level par for the tournament after a 72. A poor bogey-bogey finish. Matt Fitzpatrick ends with birdie at 18, and he files a 71 alongside yesterday\u2019s 69. He\u2019s -2 going into the weekend. Paul Casey shoots 72, having bogeyed 5 and 6 on the way home. He\u2019s level par for the tournament. And one of the shots of the week by Sepp Straka at the 334-yard par-four 4th! He flashes his drive down the middle, guiding his ball through the small opening at the front of the green and onto the putting surface! He\u2019ll have a 35-foot look at eagle! Some pleasing news regarding Nate Lashley. (Backstory at 3.50pm.) Out in 74, with another shot shed at 10, it looked as though he might not make the cut (currently projected at +2). But a run of pars home, plus birdie at 16, mean he\u2019s signing his name to a second-round 74. At -1, the 36-year-old debutant, who has suffered some hard times, will make it to the weekend. The Woods-Rose-Spieth group all make a meal of the course management puzzle that is the 8th. Perhaps spooked by Spieth plummeting into the Pacific Ocean yesterday, all three leave themselves long irons into the small green. The result is three very missable par putts. However it\u2019s only Tiger who blinks, slipping back to -1. Rose remains two clear at the top on -7, while Spieth stays at -2. Spieth\u2019s been incredibly erratic, that\u2019s only his sixth par of the day. But he\u2019s three under for his round, a mark that\u2019s only been bettered so far by Jim Furyk, so he\u2019ll be happy enough to make up ground on much of the field. A word on Adam Scott, who has flown totally under the Fox Sports radar. The 2013 Masters champion started out today with back-to-back bogeys, but birdies at 4, 6, 9, 14 and 15, with only one more dropped shot at 14, have led to a 69 that goes nicely alongside yesterday\u2019s 70. He\u2019s -3, in lovely shape for Moving Day. Just like yesterday, Matt Kuchar finishes his round on a high! He drained a 30-footer for birdie on 9 at the end of his first round; today he\u2019s chipping in from the back of 18, a 60-foot trundle that gives him a second 69 of the week. He\u2019s back in the clubhouse at -4. Brooks Koepka nearly drains his birdie putt across 9. Just the par to finish, but that\u2019s another 69 and the two-time defending champion is in very good nick ahead of the weekend, when things get real. He\u2019s -4. Par for the soon-to-be-professional Viktor Hovland, who cards a two-over 71. At level par, he\u2019s certain to be here for the weekend. But bogey for Francesco Molinari, who was grinding out a fine score despite fighting his game for the first 16 holes, then shed three shots over the closing two. A very disappointing 72, but he\u2019s still in the mix at -2. The 2003 champion from Olympia Fields, Jim Furyk, finished with a four-under 67. That\u2019s the best of the day so far, and he\u2019s -2 for the tournament. Meanwhile Matt Kuchar, having whistled his tee shot at 17 onto the beach, limits the damage to bogey and is currently just off the back of 18 in two. And over on 9, the reigning champion Brooks Koepka finds the heart of the green in regulation, and he\u2019ll have a look at birdie from 20 feet. Not for the first time today, Tiger doesn\u2019t hit a long, straight putt. A little more juice on his effort at 7, and that would have been his second birdie of the day. Rose makes the same mistake from practically the same spot, having learned nothing. Spieth makes it three pars, chipping close from the cabbage at the back. Meanwhile the afternoon wave begins, and Sepp Straka starts where he left off yesterday, in fine form. His second into 1 from 150 yards lands six feet from the flag, and in goes the birdie putt. Born in Austria but representing the US after moving Stateside as a teenager, Straka\u2019s -4. Koepka is an inch or so away from draining a 30-foot birdie effort on 8. Spieth birdies 6, then sends his tee shot at the 116-yard par-three 7th over the flag and into the tough stuff at the back. Tiger and Rose are on, left with uphill 15-20 foot putts. Molinari can\u2019t make his bogey putt, and he clatters down the standings to -3. And Stenson makes a meal of the last: a bogey after carefully laying up, and that\u2019s a level-par 71. He remains at -3. Rose splashes out to ten feet, and though he can\u2019t make his birdie, par will do given the zig-zagging route he took up the hole. He remains two in the lead at -7. Molinari doesn\u2019t enjoy so much good fortune: his ball did in fact topple over the slope to the right of 8, and though he finds it after a three-minute-nudging search, he\u2019s forced to go back to the drop zone on the other side of the cliff. He wedges his fourth into the heart of the green, but he\u2019ll have to make a 20-footer for bogey. After scrambling so many pars, it\u2019s all going wrong one hole from home. Rose can take a good thrash at his ball with a fairway wood. But it flies off to the right and for a second looks like sailing over the edge of the cliff on the right. His ball hits a mound and bounces left, into a friendly bunker. He\u2019s left on a downslope, but he\u2019ll have taken that when his ball was sailing through the air in threatening fashion. Meanwhile on 17, Matt Kuchar hooks his tee shot down into the cove on the left. A loud peal of laughter rings from the gallery, perhaps a consequence of his recent PR gaffes, who knows. Justin Rose has lost a little momentum since the turn. He\u2019s already over par on the front nine, and sending a huge hook into the gallery down the left of the par-five 6th isn\u2019t going to help. He\u2019ll need a lucky break there. As will Francesco Molinari, who slices his approach at 8 towards the cliffs on the right. It doesn\u2019t look as though his ball\u2019s toppled over, but he\u2019ll be snagged up in some thick stuff if it hasn\u2019t. Chesson Hadley follows up his opening round of 68 with a 70. As one-under rounds go, it was quite the ride: six birdies, three bogeys and a double. But you can\u2019t expect perfection from a player who has missed six of his last seven cuts. He\u2019s not missing this one, though, and he\u2019s nicely placed for the weekend at -4. Rose tidies up for par at 5. Spieth limits the damage to bogey. He slips back to -1. Chez Reavie is back home with a 70. And Koepka makes his short birdie putt on 7. Not so long ago, he was six shots off the pace. Now he\u2019s just three back. -7: Rose (14*) -5: Wise (F), Molinari (16*), Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Reavie (F), Hadley (17*), Stenson (17), Koepka (16*), Piercy A couple of lovely shots into the par threes. Rose knocks his tee shot at 5 pin high to 15 feet. He can\u2019t make the birdie putt, though. On 7, Koepka screws his wedge to five feet. Before he putts, Molinari chips in for the second time today from the back of the green! The birdie takes him to within two at -5. \u201cAw dang it, sit down! Oh my goodness.\u201d Who else but Quagmire Jordan Spieth? He hoicks his tee shot into an awful lot of nonsense to the left of the par-three 5th. And there\u2019s more, as he whips a flyer through the green and into the thick fescue on the other side. \u201cOh my God, I didn\u2019t see that coming!\u201d Marvellous commentary, but after underhitting his next chip, he\u2019ll be left with an eight-footer for bogey. Meanwhile up on 6, Molinari passes up an eight-foot birdie opportunity: he stays at -3. Koepka however birdies to join him at that mark, having reached the green in two big booms. Rose lands his wedge on the fringe at the back of the 4th, spinning the ball back to six feet. He\u2019ll have a chance to get out of there with a par. He\u2019s not escaping from this one, though. His putt doesn\u2019t drop, but that\u2019s all down to a wayward tee shot. Spieth makes a nine-foot downhill dribbler for birdie, and returns to -2. And that\u2019s where Tiger stays after failing to make a seven-footer for his birdie. As he stoops to mark his ball before tidying up, he breathes out and whispers an exasperated \u201cfucksake\u201d. Yes, yes, won\u2019t somebody think about the kids, and all that. But what perfect comic timing. Trouble for the leader at the short par-four 4th. Rose sends his tee shot over the edge of the cliff to the right. His ball doesn\u2019t topple all the way down, nestling by a plant in the penalty area, but he\u2019s not going to be able to get a club to that. A drop, and he\u2019ll need to make another up-and-down from distance to keep his three-stroke lead in tact. That\u2019s a fine finish to his round by Aaron Wise! He follows up birdie at 17 with another at 18, and ends up signing for a level-par 71. Back in 34 strokes, a very impressive salvage operation. He\u2019s the very early 36-hole clubhouse leader. Meanwhile bogey for the erratic Chesson Hadley at 7, but birdies for Chez Reavie at 16 and 17, and one for steady-eddie Henrik Stenson at 15. Here\u2019s the latest top ten [cues up Yellow Pearl] ... -8: Rose (12*) -5: Wise (F), Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Reavie (17), Hadley (16*), Stenson (16), Molinari (14*), Piercy Here\u2019s quite a round being put together by 37-year-old Japanese journeyman Kodai Ichihara. He played the back nine in 42 strokes, after making one bogey, two pars, five bogeys and a double at 18. But since turning, he\u2019s birdied 1, and eagled the second after holing out from 200 yards! And they say football\u2019s a game of two halves. He\u2019s +12 right now, so will be packing his bags once he\u2019s done, but at least he\u2019s got a fair few memories to take away with him, and stories to tell. Koepka goes closest to birdie at 5, his putt from 15 feet drifting left at the last. Molinari pars. A three-putt bogey for Hovland. Meanwhile pars all round on 3 for Rose, Woods and Spieth. Rose pearls a big drive down the centre of 3, then fails to reach the green with a delicate wedge. AAAW! he cries as the ball travels along its parabola o\u2019pain. He\u2019ll still have a fairly simple up and down from just off the front, though he\u2019d have been hoping for a good look at birdie from there. Tiger and Spieth are also both short in two. The wind\u2019s up. Molinari, at the cliff-edge par-three 5th, sends a gentle fade into the heart of the green. Hovland, who has just picked up his first birdie of the day at 4 to move back into red figures, finds the dancefloor too. The defending champ up last. Koepka caresses an 8-iron into the middle of the green. All three will have a look at birdie from mid-range. Molinari\u2019s second into 4 takes a hot bounce and flies into the thick grass up a small back at the back. No matter! He dinks a little chip down the slope, his ball hitting the flag and dropping! A birdie that takes him up to -4. After all his travails today, he\u2019s in credit for his round now! Koepka meanwhile misses a 12-footer for birdie, forcing those big shoulders to droop a bit. The psychological power of golf. Meanwhile Tiger sticks his second to 13 feet, while Rose gets a fortunate break off the bank guarding the right of the green, his ball kicking left to four feet! Tiger can\u2019t make his birdie putt; par. Spieth makes his bogey putt; he slips to -1, but that\u2019s a good result in the circumstances. And Rose rolls in his birdie effort, and he\u2019s back to -8. Also going the correct way: Aaron Wise, who birdies 17 after clipping a lovely tee shot on a very testing par-three to 12 feet. He\u2019s -4 again. -8: Rose (11*) -5: Hadley (14*), Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Wise (17), Piercy Jordan Spieth is fuming again ... though this time not with his caddie. It\u2019s a surreal situation in a bunker down the right of 2. He doesn\u2019t make a particularly good job of getting his ball over the face, but it\u2019s just about going over. However it hits a rake that was hidden in the tangled grass across the top of the bunker! \u201cOh my god, there was a rake in there!\u201d His ball clatters into it and snags in the rough. He\u2019s forced to hack onto the fairway, and is wedging four into the green. He goes close, and will have a chance to limit the damage to bogey. That was all a bit odd. Molinari bumps a chip shot to three feet, and tidies up for yet another par save. This is turning into one of the great grinds. One for the purists. Koepka has a putt of exactly 20 feet from the fringe, and he can\u2019t believe it when the fairly straight uphill effort slips by the left of the cup, maybe the width of a blade of grass away from dropping. Another par on a day when the two-time defending champion can\u2019t quite get going. Molinari\u2019s -3; Koepka\u2019s -2. Meanwhile Hadley bounces back with birdie at 5, hitting his tee shot at the par-three 5th to ten feet. He returns to -5 after a brief period away. The dangers of backspin. Koepka hits a gap wedge from 130 yards at 3, landing it next to the hole. Instead of biting a little and stopping close, it spins hysterically backwards and off the front of the green. He\u2019ll still have a look at birdie from the apron, 20 feet away, but for a while that looked so much better. Molinari is once again struggling, his ball having taken a huge bounce left off a hillock on the right, and rolling off the front of the green and back down the fairway. Rose can\u2019t make his par putt. It looked as though he had, but it horseshoes out. As close as you can get without it dropping - and Rose really isn\u2019t sure why that lipped out, a little too much pace maybe - but it\u2019s his first bogey of the day. Pars for Tiger and Spieth, who both remain at -2. But just five off the lead now. -7: Rose (10*) -5: Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen Back on 1, all the leader Rose can do is hack out of the thick stuff. He\u2019ll need to repeat Molinari\u2019s earlier antics if he\u2019s to escape with his par. He lands his wedge to six feet, so he\u2019ll have a chance to keep his second round bogey-free. Molinari makes a calm fuss-free par at 2. Picking up the dramatic slack: Brooks Koepka, whose tee shot found thick rough down the right. His 8-iron coming out is short of the green ... but no worries, because he takes out his wedge and chases a left-to-right curler to kick-in distance. A lovely save. They\u2019re -3 and -2 respectively. A chink of light for the chasing pack? Rose takes an iron for safety off the 1st tee, and sends his ball into the tallest rough down the right. Tiger\u2019s iron finds the fairway. Spieth takes a hybrid and creams it down the middle. News meanwhile of the 2003 champion Jim Furyk, who is three under for his round today through 12, and is -1 overall. As Justin Rose goes one way, his challengers move the other. Bogey for Chesson Hadley at 3; he slips back to -4. Aaron Wise makes a mess of 14, and he drops to -3. And public relations guru Matt Kuchar doubles 10, tumbling to -3 as well. Defending champ Brooks Koepka quietly parred 1 as Molinari was making yet another sensational save, incidentally, and remains at -2. -8: Rose (9*) -5: Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Hadley (12*), Piercy -3: Wise (15), Stenson (12), Kuchar (10), Molinari (10*), Straka, Grillo, McIlroy, Woodland Rose is of a mind to hole out from the bunker for eagle. We know this because he hollers BAH! as his flop squirts a little to the right and ends up three feet on the hole. Most players would be doing cartwheels after that. Birdie, and suddenly he\u2019s got a three-shot lead at -8. Birdie for Spieth, too, as he dribbles a 60-footer from the back of the green to four feet, and tidies up. He\u2019s played the back nine in 33 shots; he\u2019s -2. Tiger has to settle for par, and he\u2019s turning in 35. He\u2019s -2. Meanwhile on 1, Molinari wedges from 100 yards to six feet, and that\u2019s yet another up and down for par. This is getting daft now, which explains why he enjoys a bit of a giggle with Brooks Koepka\u2019s caddie. He remains at -3. So much for Molinari\u2019s game-changing birdie. He misses yet another fairway, this time at 1, and is forced to take his medicine and hack out. He\u2019ll have to get up and down from 100 yards. Koepka\u2019s on the green in regulation, but not within realistic birdie distance. Back on 18, Spieth reaches the green in two, Tiger lays up and wedges to 20 feet, and Rose shoves his second into the bunker front right. Molinari has a 55-footer for his eagle on 18 ... and overcooks it. The big left-to-right break is read correctly, but the pace is way off. He\u2019s got a curly 12-footer coming back. And he guides it in! He\u2019s back to -3. A deserved birdie after a fine drive and arrow-straight long iron ... and reward for all those successful par scrambles. Never give up, kids. Pars for Koepka (-2) and Hovland (E). Rose\u2019s tee shot at 17 dunks into the sand guarding the front of the green. He splashes out nicely to five feet, and makes yet another par save from the bunker. He\u2019s -7. Spieth can\u2019t get up and down from sand, and slips back to -1. It\u2019s been a back-and-forth round for the 2015 champ. Par for Tiger, who stays -2. Molinari only hit one of the first eight greens in regulation today. So of course he\u2019s on the par-five 18th in two big blows. Of course he is. He and his caddie exchange wry smiles. Two putts, and he\u2019ll be turning in level par for his round so far, which given the way he\u2019s been spraying it around, would be something else. Count no chickens. Koepka meanwhile is in the bunker front right in two. An Byeong-hun only has one big win to his name: the 2015 British PGA at Wentworth in 2015. The 27-year-old from Seoul doesn\u2019t have much to show for his efforts in the majors yet; no top-ten finishes. His best showing a tie for 23rd in this tournament at Oakmont in 2016. But he\u2019s in the top ten of this one right now. Birdies at 1 and 7, and he\u2019s -3. Meanwhile in the group behind, Andrew Putnam is the hottest player out there today. Birdies at 3, 5, 6 and now 7, and he\u2019s four under for his round, -2 overall. Putnam hasn\u2019t much of a major record either: his only previous US Open was a missed cut here in 2010. But he at least survived the cut on his next two major outings, at the last two PGAs. So the 30-year-old from Washington state appears to be slowly finding his feet in the big ones. Bounceback birdie for Jordan Spieth at 16. He\u2019s back to -2, the reward for a lovely approach to six feet. The leader Justin Rose dallied with three-putt failure, sending a long birdie effort trundling past the hole in the hot fashion. But he nailed the one coming back. He\u2019s yet to three-putt this week. He remains two clear at -7. How on earth is Molinari still at -2? He\u2019s got a downhill lie in the bunker at 17, and very little green to play with. But he clips his ball out gorgeously, rolling it softly to a couple of feet. Another successful par scramble. I make that seven in the first nine holes. All hail the Italian\u2019s refusal to buckle. This is some top-drawer US Opening! But Koepka three-putts from distance, dropping back to -2. He couldn\u2019t get anywhere near the hole with his first putt, the knuckle of the bunker in his line, sending his ball off to the left at a vicious angle. Chesson Hadley\u2019s increasingly preposterous round continues apace. Birdie at 18, and he\u2019s played the back nine in 34 strokes. He\u2019s two under for his round, having parred just two holes so far. A case study in golfing disorder. He\u2019s back up to -5, in a tie for second. Back on 17, Molinari\u2019s woes continue as he tugs his tee shot over the bunkers on the left, and is extremely fortunate that his ball takes a bounce off the tangled bank and back into the sand. Otherwise, he\u2019d have been shortsided, in thick rough, on a downslope. As things stand, he\u2019s just shortsided. He throws he tee away in disgust, channelling his hitherto unknown Inner Sergio. Koepka isn\u2019t happy either, having sent his tee shot well right. He\u2019s on the green, but facing a monster putt, and it\u2019s not yet clear whether the knuckle of the bunker is poking across his line. Watch out Michael Greller! His boss Jordan Spieth sends his second into 15 over the back and bounding into thick rough. Another misclub. He fluffs the chip coming back, and is left with a tricky, slippery eight footer. A quiet fume. But he rouses himself, takes a deep breath, and rolls in the par saver. He\u2019s -1. Par for Tiger. He\u2019s -2. And finally Justin Rose, who arrowed his second straight at the flag, leaving himself a six-footer for birdie. And it\u2019s in! The English star has a two-shot lead ... though Matt Kuchar is on his tail, having added to his birdies at 1 and 4 with a third at 7. He\u2019s joined the group in second place. -7: Rose (6*) -5: Kuchar (7), Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Wise (11), Hadley (8*), Piercy -3: Reavie (9), Stenson (8), Koepka (7*), Straka, Grillo, McIlroy, Woodland Chesson Hadley has only parred two holes so far today. His last four: birdie, double bogey, birdie, bogey. The latest slip comes at 17, where he\u2019s unable to get down in two from the back left of the green. He drops to -4. Nobody\u2019s scoring low this morning. So having just typed that, here\u2019s Brooks Koepka making his first birdie of the day at 16. The defending champ rises to -3. His playing partner Francesco Molinari meanwhile does tap in for par, though again it wasn\u2019t easy, as he\u2019d sent his second into the greenside rough. A lovely chip close saved the day, and Molinari betrayed his feelings once again by blowing his cheeks out hard after the shot. He can\u2019t keep going like this, surely. Aaron Wise drops another, at 9, and the one-time co-leader turns in 37. He\u2019s -4. On 14, both Tiger and Spieth fall back off the false front of the green with misjudged approaches. Two exquisite chips over a bunker to a tightly positioned flag, and the pair should save their pars. But only Tiger does, Spieth moving out of his stroke early, dropping back to -1. No such drama for Rose, who sent his third pin high to 12 feet. He\u2019s so close to making his birdie, but the ball stops short on these slower-than-usual greens. Par. Should we have been concerned? Molinari splashes out from the deep bunker he\u2019d plonked himself in at 15, and rolls in the eight-foot putt he was left with. What an up and down! Again! He remains at -2. He needed that ... though what he really needs is a decent tee shot, followed by a stress-free tap-in for par. He\u2019s got the first at 16. Let\u2019s see how the rest of it goes. Molinari is well off his game today. He started out today with three clutch par saves. Having since dropped a stroke, he\u2019s wayward again off the tee at 15. From a fairway bunker down the left, he finds more sand near the green. On the Guardian\u2019s patented Golfing-Inscrutability-o-meter\u2122, Molinari\u2019s average reading is definitely a lot closer to Jason Dufner than Tyrrell Hatton. But right now he\u2019s wearing his heart on his sleeve, and a deep furrow on his brow. Maybe not yet stressed, but certainly concerned. He needs to fight through this, or his round is in danger of going south. After that double on 15, a bounce-back birdie at 16 for Chesson Hadley. That shows moxie given he\u2019s in uncharted waters in major-championship golf, accustomed to missing the cut whenever he tees it up in a big one. He\u2019s -5 again. Meanwhile Nate Lashley is heading in the wrong direction again. Back-to-back bogeys at 8 and 9, and he\u2019s -1. An uncharacteristically chunky wedge by Brooks Koepka, coming into 14. He took up half of California\u2019s real estate with that one. He\u2019s short of the green, his ball snagged in extremely thick rough just over the brow of a bunker. The plus side: it\u2019s not a long way to the flag. And he swishes delicately to a couple of feet. He\u2019ll save his par. One of the chaps on US television has just described Koepka as a \u201clumberjack who can also whittle a piece of wood.\u201d Golf as heritage craft. Not necessarily too far from the truth. Meanwhile it\u2019s a third birdie in four holes for the irrepressible Jordan Spieth, who rattles in a putt from the fringe at 13. The 2015 champ is -2. He\u2019s back, baby! He should bollock his caddie more often. Chesson Hadley tumbles out of the lead after traversing the deep rough down the right of the par-four 15th. A double bogey and once again Justin Rose is our sole leader. Hadley joins Matt Kuchar at -4, everyone\u2019s favourite cash and rules obsessive making his second birdie of the morning at 4. -6: Rose (3*) -5: Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Wise (8), Hadley (6*), Kuchar (4), Piercy Tiger leaves a 25-foot birdie putt on 12 one dimple short. He stays at -2. He was the only player in the group to find the par-three with his tee shot, Rose forced to splash from the bunker to four feet. He\u2019s made five out of five sand saves this week so far. And now it\u2019s six out of six. He\u2019s -6. Spieth meanwhile clips a delicate chip from thick greenside rubbish to a couple of feet, and he remains at -1. A few spots of rain coming down. A little bit of spray from the bay. And on 13, Molinari is once again scrambling around to save his par, after hoicking his tee shot into deep oomska on the left. He\u2019s forced to gouge out, then chip to ten feet. Yet another testing putt. But he can\u2019t make it this time. A gentle right-to-left slider lips out, and he slips to -2. Meanwhile his partner Koepka races a wild birdie putt eight feet past, but makes the one coming back to hold on at -2. Bogey for Hovland, who tugs a six-footer to the left. He\u2019s -1. Birdie for Tiger at 11! Rich reward for a sensational second shot, pitched 15 feet behind the flag and spun back to eight feet in front. In goes the putt, and he\u2019s -2. Spieth follows him in, and that\u2019s back-to-back birdies at the start of his round. You wouldn\u2019t rule out the three-time major winner mounting a charge today. And Rose hits a stunning flop shot from the thick rough at the back of the green to six feet, a phenomenal effort from where he\u2019d found himself. In goes the putt, and he punches the air in steely determination. That\u2019s a quite outrageous up and down. And he\u2019s still got a share of the lead as a result. -6: Hadley (5*), Rose (2*) -5: Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Wise (7), Piercy Chesson Hadley hits the front! His third birdie in his first five holes today, this time at 14, and he\u2019s got a share with Justin Rose at -6. To think he\u2019s missed the cut in six of his last seven starts this season. And there\u2019s half a chance he could have sole ownership of it in a couple of minutes, because Rose found thick rough down the right of 11 from the tee, and could only gouge out his second over the back of the green. He\u2019s in more tangled nonsense, with a bunker in his road to boot. The 116-yard par-three 7th should be a doddle for these guys. Should be, but this is golf, isn\u2019t it. Aaron Wise, who had just taken co-ownership of the lead at the US Open, hits his tee shot long. In the thick stuff, he fluffs his chip, and runs up a double-bogey five. What a game. -6: Rose (1*) -5: Hadley (4*), Fowmer, Schauffele, Oosthuizen -4: Wise (7), Piercy -3: Molinari (3*), Kuchar (2), Straka, Grillo, McIlroy, Woodland Aaron Wise takes a share of the lead with his second birdie of the day, this time at the par-five 6th. He\u2019s -6. Nate Lashley grabs a shot back at the short par-three 7th, wedging to six feet and making birdie; he\u2019s back to -3. And at 12, Molinari bumps a chip up to five feet, then makes no mistake with his third par save in three holes. Pars for Koepka and Hovland. Koepka and Hovland both send lovely irons into the difficult par-three 12th. They\u2019ll have birdie putts from mid-range. Molinari\u2019s yet to dial in his long game, though, and misses the green. It\u2019s not the worst miss, front right in light rough, but for the third hole in a row he\u2019ll be scrambling for his par. Rose takes two putts for par at 1. Spieth rolls in a 15-footer for birdie that takes him back to level par for the championship. But Tiger hits a tentative birdie putt, the ball always squeaking off to the right. Doubly poor show, on account of having seen Rose\u2019s birdie effort (from a longer distance) dribble off to that side at the end. He stays at -1. Rose, Spieth and Tiger are all on the 10th in regulation. Tiger\u2019s approach in particular is worthy of comment, an iron bumped into the front of the green, using the left-to-right camber to guide his ball towards the cup. He\u2019s pin high, six feet from the flag, and a fast start is on the cards. Brooks Koepka passes up another good birdie opportunity, this time at 11. He\u2019s got a straight putt up the green from 20 feet, but doesn\u2019t quite hit the ball, the morning dew from the bay slowing things down early doors. Viktor Hovland makes a similar error and has to settle for a par as well. A rueful smile. Then it\u2019s Frencesco Molinari\u2019s turn. He makes his, though that\u2019s another par save, required after flaying his drive into the thick stuff. Molinari as gritty and dogged as ever. The sort of determined play that could win a man a US Open title. Back on 10, the second featured group of the morning tees it up. Jordan Spieth clatters his drive down the middle. No need to be giving out to his caddie Michael Greller for that one. Next up, the leader Justin Rose, who will be very happy with his big blooter down the track. And finally Tiger Woods, looking for his first US Open in 11 years. A battling 70 yesterday, and he starts his second round with a fine drive. It\u2019s going to be a magical morning! Popularity\u2019s Matt Kuchar finished off his round of 69 yesterday by curling in a long birdie putt at 9. He\u2019s built on that momentum with an opening birdie today at 1. He\u2019s -3. Paul Casey birdies 11 to move to -2, after a 70 yesterday that only featured one blemish, an ugly double-bogey at 9. Casey\u2019s been sniffing around the top of the major leader boards for a while now, with a tendency to score consistently well but ruin it with widescreen blowouts at single holes. If he can somehow figure a way to limit the damage when things start going wrong, that elusive maiden major may yet be his one day. Another birdie for Chesson Hadley! He makes it at the par-three 12th, and he\u2019s grabbed himself a share of second spot at -5. Alongside him, Aaron Wise, who wipes out the bogey at 2 with birdie at 5. Meanwhile two easy putts for Viktor Hovland from the back of 10; an opening par. Brooks Koepka shaves the cup with his birdie effort; par. And it\u2019s a par ... that\u2019ll feel like a birdie ... for Francesco Molinari, who rolls in his saver. What he\u2019d have given for that when he was watching his drive topple off the fairway and down the cliff. He ambles off smiling. An early boost. It\u2019s overcast at Pebble Beach. Not too much in the way of wind, but it\u2019s humid. The first featured group of the morning tees off at 10, the most difficult hole on the course yesterday. The Open champ Francesco Molinari is up first ... and his drive dribbles off the right-hand side of the fairway and down into the penalty area. The waves crashing in below. He\u2019ll be forced to take a drop. His third in is quite something, and he\u2019ll have a look at escaping with an improbable par from 15 feet. A miserable start to his round, especially as he only made one bogey yesterday on is way to a 68. The amateur and Pebble Beach specialist Viktor Hovland, who\u2019ll be turning pro next week, splits the fairway and finds the green in regulation. He shot a lovely 69 yesterday, having zipped out of the blocks with four birdies in the first six holes. And the two-time reigning champion Brooks Koepka hits a perfect drive, then screeches a wedge to eight feet. The most difficult hole on the course! Collin Morikawa turned professional last week. The 22-year-old from LA, a former world number-one amateur, teed it up at the Canadian Open, and finished in a tie for 14th place. He\u2019s hit the ground running alright, and having shot a fine level-par 71 yesterday, is moving up the standings this morning. A couple of heat-seeking approaches, at 1 and now 4, have catapulted him to -2. A player worth keeping an eye on, by the evidence on show to date. Chesson Hadley has done absolutely nothing in the majors to date. The 31-year-old from Raleigh, North Carolina has previously competed in seven of them, surviving the cut only once, on his way to a tie for 61st at the 2017 PGA. But he\u2019s going along nicely this time. Previously his best round at a US Open was a 75, shot at Shinnecock Hills last year. However yesterday he bested that by seven strokes, and he\u2019s opened his round today in similarly impressive fashion, firing his second at 10 from 200 yards to ten feet, then knocking in the birdie putt. He\u2019s -4 now, in a tie for fifth, uncharted waters ... and somewhat unexpected, seeing he\u2019s missed the cut in six of the last seven tournaments he\u2019s played. It\u2019s all about peaking at the right time, huh. Also heading the wrong way in a rather dispiriting manner is Nate Lashley. The 36-year-old from Nebraska made his US Open debut yesterday, shooting a marvellous 67. Good luck finding someone who doesn\u2019t want him to keep it up, because any level of success here this week would tug on the heartstrings. Lashley\u2019s been troubled with his knees, and only retains his Tour card due to a medical extension. Enough problems for anyone to battle. But there\u2019s also a tragic backstory: back in 2004, he lost both parents and his girlfriend in a plane crash as they travelled home after watching him compete as a junior at the University of Arizona. After all he\u2019s been through, it\u2019d be a lovely bittersweet story if he could - first things first - at least make the cut on debut. But out early this morning, his driver let him down on the opening two holes; a couple of bogeys, and he slips back into a large pack of 13 players at -2. Plenty of time to arrest the slide though. Good morning Carmel Bay! A new day\u2019s only just begun, and already there\u2019s been some movement at the top of the leader board. Some downward movement. Aaron Wise hadn\u2019t made a bogey since his opening hole yesterday, the 10th, en route to a fine opening round of 66. But it\u2019s not taken him long to ship another shot today. The 22-year-old former Tour Rookie of the Year has paid for an errant drive at 2. Do not drive into the rough at at US Open. It\u2019s like Fight Club, only there\u2019s just one rule. Wise slips to -4, now a couple off Justin Rose\u2019s overnight lead. Preambles are so Thursday. We\u2019ve got another long day ahead of us, so let\u2019s get straight down to business. -6: Rose -5: Fowler, Schauffele, Oosthuizen, Wise -4: Piercy, Lashley -3: Straka, Grillo, McIlroy, Woodland, Reavie, Hadley, Stenson, Molinari -2: Arnaus, Kaymer, Rahm, Leishman, DeChambeau, McDowll, Matsuyama, Garcia, Hovland -a-, Koepka, Kuchar, Fitzpatrick ... and here are today\u2019s tee times (all BST).

Still, four of the six top-polling candidates landed on 27 June, setting the stage for a high-stakes evening. Being paired with Biden, 76, and Sanders, 77, could give Buttigieg an opportunity to emphasize the \u201cnext generation\u201d theme that he has been touting. At 37, the mayor is the youngest of the leading contenders. Sanders and Warren, considered favorites of the party\u2019s liberal wing, won\u2019t be going head-to-head. Among the rest of the field, Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, could use the opportunity of a night less crowded with frontrunners to draw attention to his climate-change agenda. Colorado\u2019s former governor, John Hickenlooper, who has been among the most aggressive critics of Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism, will have a chance to make those points to him face-to-face. Featured on 26 June will be Warren, Booker, O\u2019Rourke, Inslee, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former congressman John Delaney of Maryland, congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio. The next night\u2019s lineup has Biden, Sanders, Harris, Buttigieg, Hickenlooper, the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the Colorado senator Michael Bennet,the author Marianne Williamson, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and the congressman Eric Swalwell, of California. NBC will face its own test, to see if it can make compelling programming out of crowded, fractious stages on the opening nights of debate season. The debate will be shown both nights in prime time, 9pm to 11pm, on the broadcast network, as well as on MSNBC and Telemundo, and it will be streamed on various platforms. The NBC personalities Lester Holt, Savannah Guthrie, Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart will be featured.",

      "bodyText": "We\u2019re ending our live coverage for the day, thanks for following along! Some key links and updates from the day: The lineup for the first 2020 debates has been set, with Elizabeth Warren, Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke facing off on one evening, and Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders facing off on a second night. The US accused Iran of detaining the crew of one of two oil tankers attacked in the Gulf of Oman this week. Anita Hill said she could see herself voting for Joe Biden, despite his past treatment of her, saying she considers him \u201cperfectly capable of running for president\u201d. Emails revealed that a member of the Trump administration\u2019s National Security Council sought help from advisers of a conservative thinktank to challenge the reality of a human-induced climate crisis. A court of appeals sent Trump\u2019s trans military ban back to a lower court, saying the March 2018 policy required heightened scrutiny. The lawyer for Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Trump, called to further delay Flynn\u2019s sentencing for the crime of lying to federal investigators about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador. A federal appeals court ruled today that the Trump administration cannot block undocumented minors in custody from getting abortions. The justice department released its formal opinion backing the Treasury\u2019s decision to withhold Trump\u2019s tax returns from Congress. Florida\u2019s Republican governor signed an anti-immigrant bill banning \u201csanctuary\u201d policies in the state. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner took in as much as $135m in income during their second year as aides to Trump. The AP reports: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner took in as much as $135m in income during their second year as aides to Donald Trump, generated from their vast real estate holdings, stocks and bonds and even a book deal, according to their financial disclosures released Friday. Ivanka Trump\u2019s stake in her family\u2019s Washington DC hotel down the street from the Oval Office generated $3.95m in revenue in 2018, barely changed from a year earlier. The hotel, a favorite gathering spot for foreign diplomats and lobbyists, is at the center of two federal lawsuits claiming Trump is violating the constitution\u2019s ban on foreign government payments to the president. Another big Ivanka Trump holding, a trust that includes her personal business selling handbags, shoes and accessories, generated at least $1m in revenue in 2018, down from at least $5m the year before. Ivanka Trump announced in July of last year that she planned to close her fashion company to focus on her work as a White House adviser for her father. Read the full story here: And the Guardian\u2019s recent reporting on Kushner\u2019s finances: Some useful commentary on the court decision today sending Trump\u2019s trans military ban back to a lower court: The decision could have broader implications beyond military policy, given the precedent the ninth circuit is setting for protecting trans people from discrimination. Read the full decision here: The decision could potentially help trans people in other contexts, like access to health care and workplace discrimination: Research has shown the trans military ban is unpopular: A federal appeals court ruled today that the Trump administration cannot block undocumented minors in custody from getting abortions. The judges said they were \u201cunanimous in rejecting the government\u2019s position that its denial of abortion access can be squared with Supreme Court precedent\u201d, adding that court precedent holds that \u201ca person has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy before fetal viability, and the government cannot unduly burden her decision\u201d. The Trump administration had argued that it was trying to prevent \u201cabortion tourism\u201d. Some background from Slate\u2019s Mark Joseph Stern here: The Trump campaign\u2019s pollster has responded to the reports from earlier suggesting that the president\u2019s internal reelection data shows him losing to Joe Biden in critical battleground states. The statement claimed the media was reporting on \u201cold numbers\u201d from March that represented a \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario: The polling data showed a double-digit lead for Biden in Pennsylvania (55-39) and Wisconsin (51-41). It predicted Biden leading by seven points in Florida. The justice department has released its formal opinion backing the Treasury\u2019s decision to withhold Trump\u2019s tax returns from Congress: The 33-page memo from the DOJ office of legal counsel claimed that Democrats\u2019 request for the tax returns did not serve a \u201clegitimate legislative purpose\u201d and was instead aimed at making the documents public: Under the facts and circumstances, the Secretary of the Treasury reasonably and correctly concluded that the Committee\u2019s asserted interest in reviewing the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s audits of presidential returns was pretextual and that its true aim was to make the President\u2019s tax returns public, which is not a legitimate legislative purpose. The DOJ view echoes the arguments Trump\u2019s private attorneys have made in court: Federal courts have rejected these arguments, and some have noted that the law doesn\u2019t require Congress to have a specific reason to request these records. Hello - Sam Levin in the San Francisco office here, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. Florida\u2019s Republican governor has signed an anti-immigrant bill banning \u201csanctuary\u201d policies in the state. From the AP: All law enforcement agencies in Florida will have to cooperate with federal immigration authorities under a bill signed by the governor, Ron DeSantis, on Friday during a ceremony that often felt like a campaign rally for him and Donald Trump. The bill prohibits local governments from enacting \u201csanctuary\u201d polices that protect undocumented immigrants from deportation. It will require law enforcement to honor US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers for undocumented immigrants who are arrested or convicted of a crime. It exempts crime victims and witnesses. Some reactions: The Ninth Circuit court of appeals has sent Donald Trump\u2019s transgender military ban back to a lower court, saying that the March 2018 policy requires heightened scrutiny. The Guardian investigated the impact Trump\u2019s ban is having on trans military members. NBC announced how the Democratic debates would be split later this month, with a field of 20 candidates split over two days. The lawyer for Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Trump, called to further delay Flynn\u2019s sentencing for the crime of lying to federal investigators about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period. Mexico\u2019s government has released it\u2019s one page agreement with the White House - an agreement last seen brandished by the president at a press conference where photographers managed to snap a photo that revealed part of the paper\u2019s contents. The agreement says the two countries will discuss how to respond to the swell of Central American migrants seeking refuge in the US and Mexico. It also states that if the US, after consulting with Mexico, determines the Mexican government has not achieved the desired results of measures meant to curb migration in 45 days, Mexico will do what it can to reduce migration. The Wall Street Journal has an interesting read about how after launching an atypical presidential election bid, Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign team is taking a more traditional path: The campaign aims to build a political infrastructure that can operate regardless of what Mr. Trump says on stage or on social media. Mr. Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is spoken of as his own brand, separate from the campaign. Democrats are taking the president\u2019s campaign very seriously, said Adrienne Watson, a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee. \u201cCongratulations to the president for having a functioning campaign this time,\u201d she said, adding that Democrats plan to question his record on helping working-class Americans and lowering drug prices. Four years ago, Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign aides were shoehorned into an unused corner of Trump Tower, where drywall was never hung on some wood-framed walls and the few low-level aides on the payroll were crammed into offices so tight their knees touched. Aides used their own computers and cellphones for campaign business. Now, dozens of staffers are spread out across a central campaign office that occupies the 14th floor of an Arlington, Va., office building, where conference rooms overlook the Potomac River. Some advisers say they hope Mr. Trump never visits the sprawling campaign office, worried he will disapprove of the size of the operation. Sarah Huckabee Sanders has only a few weeks left of her tenure as White House press secretary and the rumor mill is churning with possible replacements. Four possible replacements, according to Reuters, are: Stephanie Grisham, Melania Trump\u2019s communications director; Heather Nauert, the former State Department spokeswoman; Tony Sayegh, the outgoing Treasury department spokesman and Hogan Gidley, deputy White House secretary. In a January 2019 CNN article about how Trump was making the White House press team irrelevant, the news channel revealed Trump hadn\u2019t quite grasped Gidley\u2019s name (though he was impressed by his work): Once, after watching Gidley on his screen in the residence, the President walked over to the communications office to tell the staff he thought they were handling the shutdown well. In the days afterward, Trump confused several officials when he directed them to, \u201cGet me Tidley.\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d puzzled staffers asked. \u201cTidley,\u201d Trump replied. \u201cI want to talk to Hogan Tidley.\u201d They informed him that the deputy press secretary\u2019s last name was Gidley, not Tidley. Law professor Anita Hill said she would not rule out voting for Joe Biden if he were to become the Democratic nominee in next year\u2019s presidential election in an interview broadcast Thursday night. Biden oversaw the 1991 Congressional hearing where Hill testified that US supreme court nominee Clarence Thomas had persistently sexually harassed her when they worked together. Biden called Hill to discuss the matter before announcing his presidential bid. Hill said she was not satisfied with Biden\u2019s comments and that she did not consider it a proper apology. In response to a question about whether she could see herself voting for Biden if he were to become the 2020 nominee, she said: \u201cOf course I could.\u201d She declined to name a favorite from the packed field of Democratic candidates, but she that she would like to see gender violence discussed in the debates and for political leaders to take the issue seriously. \u201cI want our leaders to stand up and say this is a serious problem that women are not safe in the workplace, not safe in our schools, they\u2019re not safe on our streets and that we are going to use the government resources to illuminate the problem,\u201d she said. Donald Trump\u2019s internal reelection campaign poll has him losing to Joe Biden in key battleground states, according to poll results obtained by ABC News: The polling data showed a double-digit lead for Biden in Pennsylvania 55-39 and Wisconsin 51-41 and had Biden leading by seven points in Florida. In Texas, a Republican stronghold, the numbers showed the president only leading by two points. Trump has said such data does not exist. When confronted with ABC\u2019s findings, his campaign confirmed they were old, outdated numbers. \u201cThese leaked numbers are ancient, in campaign terms, from months-old polling that began in March before two major events had occurred: the release of the summary of the Mueller report exonerating the President, and the beginning of the Democrat candidates defining themselves with their far-left policy message,\u201d Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale told ABC News in a statement. The Ninth Circuit court of appeals has sent Donald Trump\u2019s transgender military ban back to a lower court, saying that the March 2018 policy requires heightened scrutiny. The court did not address the legality of the ban, which was enacted in response to a 2016 Obama adminstration decision to end a ban on openly transgender people serving in the military. The Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington investigated the impact Trump\u2019s ban is having on the 15,000 trans military members in an important piece published yesterday: All are in aircrew and at the sharp end of the US fighting machine. They are familiar with the intense sacrifices to family and self that a military career involves, and have put their lives on the line in conflict zones. Yet they are now having to cope with severe pressures brought about by the ban. That includes mounting hostility from transphobic peers who see Trump\u2019s move as license to taunt and ridicule, as well as the daily fear that if they are outed as trans they could lose everything. The stakes are now so high that all four spoke to the Guardian insisting on absolute anonymity. As one of them put it: \u201cIf I were found out by even one person, that would be the end of my flying career.\u201d The lawyer for Michael Flynn, a former national security adviser to Trump, called to further delay Flynn\u2019s sentencing for the crime of lying to federal investigators about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition period. On Friday, the attorney requested the sentencing not be held for at least 60 days. Flynn recently changed lawyers. Four years ago this weekend, Donald Trump announced he would run for president after descending a golden escalator. The Guardian\u2019s Adam Gabbatt spoke to people who were there: For Heather Haddon, then a political reporter at the Wall Street Journal, one of the surprises was that Trump had finally done it. The president likes to insist that 2016 was the first time he had run for office, but as far back as 1988 he had flirted with running, and he ran for the Reform party nomination in 1999. \u201cDefinitely the sense was \u2026 there\u2019s no way this guy is going to make it,\u201d Haddon said. As for the event itself, Haddon remembers there being an \u201calmost pro-wrestling\u201d tone to the announcement. \u201cIt was angry but it was also so matter-of-fact,\u201d said Haddon, who now covers business at the Journal. \u201cIt just seemed so stream-of-consciousness. Going from one topic to another, things that might, I guess, excite people, set people off. It was all just sort of spewed out there.\u201d Donald Trump accused his former White House counsel, Don McGahn, of lying under oath during special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. McGahn said Trump repeatedly sought to fire Mueller, Trump says it\u2019s not true. Trump celebrated his 73rd birthday with a 50 minute Fox &amp; Friends interview at 8am. The hosts said they thought the interview would last at most ten minutes, but instead were told about Trump\u2019s appointee for a border czar (Thomas Homan) and how Melania Trump is the \u201cnew Jackie O.\u201d Trump also said he wouldn\u2019t fire White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, after a federal watchdog said she should be removed from federal government employment. And while Trump in the interview also accused Iran of being responsible for an oil tanker attack, the US description of the event was disputed, in part, by the operator of one of the ships. And the first broadcast news Democratic debate groups have been announced, with a field of 20 candidates split over two days. Here are the debate dates: Wednesday, June 26: Cory Booker, New Jersey senator; Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts senator; Beto O\u2019Rourke, former Texas representative; Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota senator; John Delaney, former Maryland representative; Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii representative; Juli\u00e1n Castro, former housing secretary; Tim Ryan, Ohio representative; Bill de Blasio, New York City mayor; Jay Inslee, Washington governor. Thursday, June 27: Kamala Harris, California senator; Joe Biden, former vice president; Bernie Sanders, Vermont senator; Pete Buttigieg, Indiana mayor; Kirsten Gillibrand, New York senator; Michael Bennet, Colorado senator; Marianne Williamson, author; California representative; Eric Swalwell, California representative; Andrew Yang, entrepreneur; John Hickenlooper, Colorado governor. With such a crowded Democratic field heading into the 2020 election, NBC\u2019s primary debate has been split into two groups. One group will debate 26 June, the other 27 June. In a draw closed to the press, the groups were determined as follows: Taylor Swift, who for many years avoided speaking about politics, released a track from her forthcoming album at midnight and apparently Oregon senator, Ron Wyden, is a fan. The tune - You Need to Calm Down - swings between Swift assailing internet critics and homophobes, with a shout out to the group Glaad, which pushes for improved representation of LGBTQ people in the media. Swift sings: \u201cWhy are you mad when you could be GLAAD? / Sunshine on the street at the parade / But you would rather be in the dark ages / Makin\u2019 that sign must\u2019ve taken all night.\u201d Wyden highlighted the new track in a tweet to Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, encouraging him to support the Equality Act. The act would add \u201csexual orientation\u201d and \u201cgender identity\u201d as protected classes under federal civil rights law. Swift started a petition in support of the Equality Act earlier this month. The Trump administration and Congress owe Washington DC more than $7m from Trump\u2019s inauguration, reports the Washington Post, citing federal and city financial records. The total cost of the four-day celebration, which culminated with a parade and gathering of roughly 600,000 people on the Mall, was $27.3 million. As a result, the District has been forced to dip into a special fund that covers annual security costs for protecting the city from terrorist threats and hosting other events such as demonstrations, state funerals and the visits of foreign dignitaries. That fund, which for years was adequately replenished by federal dollars, is now on track to enter the red by this fall, records show. This adds further fuel to criticism about Trump\u2019s planned speech on the Fourth of July in Washington DC, which will likely drive up security costs for one of the most popular events in the Capitol each year. Critics are not only worried about the cost, but are also concerned Trump will turn the event into a political rally instead of a staid, non-partisan, celebration. After Donald Trump accused his former White House counsel of lying under oath in a clip released this morning, political analysts noted the president is also trying to stop McGahn testifying before congressional committees investigating the findings of the Mueller report. Those findings include McGahn\u2019s testimony that the president instructed him to find a way to fire Mueller, repeatedly. In an interview clip ABC News released this morning, Trump said he never asked McGahn to fire Mueller. He also said McGahn \u201cmay have been confused\u201d when he told investigators that Trump had directed him to fire Mueller \u2013 a stunning accusation to make against his former legal adviser. Neoconservative political analyst, Bill Kristol, says McGahn needs to issue a statement: Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has dropped another plan for if she is elected president \u2013 this one targeting entrepreneurs of color who face more hurdles in starting new businesses than white entrepreneurs. Under her plan, the government would provide $7bn in grants, not loans, to entrepreneurs by making adjustments to similar, existing government programs. In a post on Medium, the Warren campaign outlined the plan and explained why she created it: The small business gap is another example of how the racial wealth gap in America holds back our economy and hurts Black, Latinx, Native American, and other minority families and communities. And because the government helped create that wealth gap with decades of sanctioned discrimination, the government has an obligation to address it head on \u2014 with bold policies that go right at the heart of the problem. The New York Times released a design for the $20 bill featuring anti-slavery activist Harriet Tubman, which has been embroiled in controversy since the Trump adminstration announced it was delaying the new bill\u2019s release by six years. Last month, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin said the release of the redesigned bill would be delayed six years after the Obama administration\u2019s planned launch of the bill in 2020. During his campaign for president, Trump criticized the decision to redesign the bill, calling it \u201cpure political correctness\u201d. Current and former treasury department officials told the New York Times that Mnuchin delayed the bill\u2019s release out of concern Trump would cancel the plan outright. Mnuchin told the Times he delayed it for technical reasons. The US military has released video footage which it says shows an Iranian military patrol boat approaching one of two tankers attacked in the Gulf of Oman, to support the Trump administration\u2019s claims that Iran was responsible \u2013 a claim the Iranian government denies. The ship\u2019s Japanese operator, Kokuka Sangyo, said Friday that the ship was attacked by a flying object, disputing part of the US description of the attack, according to the New York Times. The operator\u2019s president, Yutaka Katada, citing accounts from the ship\u2019s crew, said: \u201cI do not think there was a time bomb or an object attached to the side of the ship.\u201d The attacks escalated tension between the US and Iran, which have been in a standoff since the US imposed economic sanctions on Iran in an attempt to force the renegotiation of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Donald Trump said Friday that the US had \u201cexposed\u201d Iran\u2019s responsibility for the attacks on Friday and in an interview with Fox &amp; Friend said: \u201cIran did do it.\u201d Tehran denied all responsibility for Thursday\u2019s attacks and its foreign minister, Javad Zarif, suggested others could be trying to provoke a conflict between Iran and the US. On Friday he tweeted that the US had \u201cimmediately jumped to make allegations against Iran without a shred of factual or circumstantial evidence\u201d. Speaking with Fox &amp; Friends, Trump ever so slightly walked back his comments from two days ago about how he is willing to accept help from a foreign government in the next presidential election. He would still listen to the information, Trump said, but if it is \u201cbad\u201d, he would tell US law enforcement. \u201cOf course you give it to the FBI or report it to the attorney general,\u201d he said. Two days ago, he dismissed the notion of calling the FBI because the agency \u201cdoesn\u2019t have enough agents\u201d. In the Fox &amp; Friends interview, Trump in general maintained his earlier position, which was in favor of accepting help from foreign governments to win an election, by saying: \u201cIf I don\u2019t listen, how am I going to know?\u201d Trump claims he never suggested firing special counsel Robert Mueller, despite his former White House counsel Don McGahn saying he did. In the Mueller investigation, which Trump repeatedly described as a \u201cwitch-hunt\u201d, McGahn testified under oath that the president repeatedly instructed him to have Mueller removed. Trump is now saying McGahn lied. \u201cThe story on that very simply, number one, I was never going to fire Mueller. I never suggested firing Mueller,\u201d Trump told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos in a clip the network released earlier this morning. Stephanopoulos then referenced McGahn\u2019s testimony. \u201cI don\u2019t care what [McGahn] says, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Trump responded. Then why would he lie? \u201cBecause he wanted to make himself look like a good lawyer,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOr he believed it because I would constantly tell anybody that would listen, including you, including the media, that Robert Mueller was conflicted. Robert Mueller had a total conflict of interest.\u201d Fox and Friends anchors said they thought the interview with Trump, which just concluded at the 50 minute mark, would last ten minutes. One of the more bizarre moments in the interview was when Trump sharply veered from speaking about relations with North Korea to declaring first lady Melania Trump the \u201cnew Jackie O.\u201d \u201cWe have our own Jackie O today, it\u2019s called Melania. We\u2019ll call it \u2018Melania T,\u2019\u201d Trump said. In March, Trump made a similar comparison in an interview with Breitbart: \u201cIf Ivanka Trump were a Democrat or a liberal democrat, even better, she\u2019d be the toast of the world. Same thing with our great first lady, who people love by the way. If our first lady, if I were a Democrat instead of a Republican, she\u2019d be Jackie O times twenty. Instead, they go after her.\u201d Trump is on a characteristic marathon of breaking news on Fox &amp; Friends right now, having spent about 40 minutes so far on a telephone interview with the show. One big news item: apparently Thomas Homan \u2013 a former acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) and current Fox News contributor \u2013 is being made \u201cborder czar\u201d, a position the Trump administration invented. Good morning and happy Friday Donald Trump has just kicked off his birthday celebrations by chatting with Fox &amp; Friends and announcing he will not fire Kellyanne Conway after a federal watchdog said she should be removed from her position as White House counselor. \u201cIt looks to me like they\u2019re trying to take away her right on free speech,\u201d Trump said of Conway. The US Office of Special Counsel (OSC) on Thursday recommended Conway be removed from the White House because she violated the Hatch Act, which bars government employees from engaging in political campaign activity. Conway is \u201cjust a great person\u201d, Trump told Fox &amp; Friends. We\u2019ll have more on Trump\u2019s morning interview with Fox &amp; Friends shortly. These frequent interviews with Fox are a prime example of how the public role of White House press secretary has shrunk under Trump. Yesterday, he announced Sarah Sanders would be stepping down from the post at the end of the month, though her role was reduced well before then, writes the Guardian\u2019s Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith: The more [Trump] he talked, the more pointless Sanders\u2019 briefings became, since she merely parroted his tweets, evaded serious policy questions and channeled her boss\u2019s anti-media barbs.",

It was a game that\u2019s had absolutely everything \u2013 from controversial decisions, VAR decisions, to a comeback victory \u2013 I mean what else can you ask for?\u201d As Elise Kellond-Knight succinctly captured, more than any game so far at the France 2019 World Cup, Australia\u2019s remarkable 3-2 win over Brazil deserved to be acclaimed as a celebration of football. Two nations bound in mutual distemper, packed with champion players, either at their peak or in the twilight of their powers, scrapping and fighting with an intensity and determination that was palpable from the stands. Whereas some teams play with physicality and others with skill, both the Matildas and Canarinhas were exemplars of both.

And yet somehow, amid all the reaction to this pulsating game, a stubbornly resistant thread of negativity has crept in once again. Kerr\u2019s buoyant post-match expression of personality was branded \u201cimmature\u201d, some even questioned whether the \u201chaters\u201d she was responding to even existed. Commentators from back home concluded that Kerr must be mistaken \u2013 because all of Australia was behind the Matildas. An entirely acceptable claim if you\u2019re oblivious to the homophobic or sexist abuse hurled daily at female players \u2013 something that\u2019s exacerbated by an environment in which a months-old controversy is given greater prominence throughout the first week of the tournament than the voices or the actions of the Matildas themselves. There are no shortage of remarkable stories from within this tight-knit group of players. Hayley Raso\u2019s recovery from a broken back, Lisa De Vanna\u2019s quest to score at a fourth consecutive World Cup, even player of the match Chloe Logarzo\u2019s star turn in Montpellier, just a few years after nearly walking away from the game. Kellond-Knight, a player coming into France 2019 under an injury cloud, not only made a positive return against Brazil, but completed 90 minutes for the first time in three months, solving Australia\u2019s left-back conundrum at the same time. Logarzo and Tameka Yallop got through a power of work in midfield, but more than that, their positive aggression helped tip the scales Australia\u2019s way as the match progressed. To come away clutching at a cloud from one of Australia\u2019s biggest silver lining evenings takes almost a wilful ignorance of the sheer joyousness fans witnessed in Montpellier. With so much pressure, and potentially the Matildas\u2019 World Cup hopes on the line, the win over Brazil finally shuts down some persistently nagging questions \u2013 firstly, whether the players have bought into Milicic\u2019s footballing vision, and secondly, whether it can be a successful one. \u201cPeople don\u2019t understand the belief we have in this team,\u201d said Kerr. \u201cThey don\u2019t understand the confidence we have in each other, the confidence we have in Ante.\u201d Accidentally leaving her player of the match trophy at the press conference, Logarzo quipped that she\u2019d left it behind deliberately for \u201ccoach\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe real player of the match\u201d. \u201cI think that win was definitely for Ante,\u201d Logarzo said earlier in the night. \u201cThe criticism is more on his behalf, and it\u2019s really disheartening for us to hear that because the amount of belief he\u2019s instilled in us and the amount of work he\u2019s put in is incredible.\u201d The players have told us time and time again \u2013 before and during the tournament, offering glowing endorsements of Milicic\u2019s attention to detail, sophisticated tactical planning, and ability to pick up the playing group again after the tumultuous events of January.
