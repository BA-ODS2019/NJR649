      "bodyText": "The beauty of fables is that even though they are incredibly old, many of their lessons still hold true today. None more so than Aesop\u2019s The Boy Who Cried Wolf, written in 600BC. I remember hearing this story as a child, and especially thinking how awful the shepherd boy must have felt when he realised the consequences of crying wolf too many times. Aesop was right then, and he\u2019s still right now. What worries me deeply is the frequency and ferocity with which home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has been caught crying wolf. This is a man who holds one of the most powerful positions in Scott Morrison\u2019s cabinet. What\u2019s more, Dutton has a key leadership role when it comes to keeping our nation safe and is responsible for a department with more than 23,000 public servants across multiple security, intelligence and immigration and border protection agencies. But how can Australians believe a minister who routinely manipulates, misrepresents and mischaracterises the truth for political gain, as Dutton does? Take the debate on medevac, for example. Since the medevac laws were enacted, only two patients have been transferred to Australia without the approval of Dutton or the immigration minister, David Coleman. The ministers didn\u2019t reject these two on security or character concerns, but on medical grounds. These two individuals were only transferred to Australia after being assessed by an expert panel of doctors that Dutton got to choose. This panel includes some of Australia\u2019s best doctors, including the commonwealth chief medical officer and the surgeon general of Australian Border Force. This means that every other asylum seeker or refugee that has come to Australia for urgent medical care has been approved by either himself or Coleman. But despite this, Dutton has been vigorously arguing that \u201ctwo doctors from Nimbin\u201d can force the government to bring people from Manus or Nauru to Australia. These claims are simply not true, and Dutton knows it. At every step of the way, the government or government-appointed doctors control who comes to Australia through medevac. Dutton also claimed that1,000 people would flood Australian through medevac. That hasn\u2019t happened at all. Some 30 people have been approved to come to Australia through medevac \u2013 and all of these transfers of people have been explicitly approved by ministers or ministerial-appointed doctors. We\u2019ve also seen Dutton claim that some doctors are working to bring refugees on Nauru and Papua New Guinea to Australia without the refugee even giving their consent. Again, this just isn\u2019t true. Refugees must give their consent to be involved in medevac not once, but twice. First when they themselves must ask to be considered for medical evacuation by the Medical Evacuation Response Group. And second, when doctors from the group are assigned to assess the patient\u2019s case, the doctors must also gain their patient\u2019s consent then to access their health records. I could go on and on. I mean, Dutton wilfully claims that the medevac laws stop him from sending patients back to Manus Island or Nauru after they\u2019re treated, or prevent him from mitigating security concerns he may have with bringing patients to Australia, or apply to any new arrivals on Manus and Nauru. All of this is not true, and he knows it. Dutton now claims he and the government will repeal the medevac legislation but he is yet to explain why or whether he really will move the bill. Is Dutton crying wolf again with his claims to repeal medevac, or will the government actually go ahead with his plans? Among all this bluster from Dutton, I am confident the Australian people support medevac, because they know we can be strong on borders and still provide urgent lifesaving care to people who need it. I\u2019m also confident the Australian people can see through the mistruths that Dutton is spreading. But what worries me is that with Dutton so regularly being caught crying wolf, what will happen when we face a serious risk to our national security? When Dutton stands up and warns Australia about the risks we face, will Australians be willing to listen? Will we trust him? I also worry about what kind of shadow Dutton\u2019s reputation as the boy who cried wolf will cast on the national security agencies he leads. Asio. The Australian federal police. Australian Border Force. The Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. Austrac. I hold these agencies in high esteem \u2013 as I do the thousands of hard-working women and men who commit their professional lives to keeping Australia safe. What are the ramifications of a lack of trust by the Australian people in the minister whose leadership is meant to keep us safe? The shepherd boy cried wolf once too often and endangered his village. For Peter Dutton, the minister for home affairs, the consequences could be far more dire.

The former House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey supported her following the death of her husband, Michael Williams, in 2001.</p> <p>In 2018, it was alleged that Spacey invited the actor Anthony Rapp to a party at his home in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. Rapp alleged that Spacey lifted him on to his bed and tried to climb on top of him.</p> <p>Spacey responded to the allegations at the time saying he did not remember the incident, but apologising for it nonetheless.</p> <p>In an online statement, he said: \u201cI honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago.

      "bodyText": "Dame Judi Dench has spoken out about her sadness at seeing her friends Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey shunned from the big screen. Despite condemning their behaviour publicly, Dench told the Radio Times she was concerned the pair\u2019s work would be forgotten. Dench does not defend Spacey and Weinstein against allegations over their misconduct but rued the treatment of Spacey in particular, whose performances were removed from Ridley Scott\u2019s 2017 film All the Money in the World after it was completed. \u201cWhat kind of agony is that?\u201d she said. \u201cAre we going to negate 10 years at the Old Vic and everything that he did [as artistic director] \u2013 how wonderful he\u2019s been in all those films? Are we just not going to see all those films that Harvey produced?\u201d \u201cYou cannot deny somebody a talent. You might as well never look at a Caravaggio painting [he was a murderer]. You might as well never have gone to see No\u00ebl Coward [accused of predatory behaviour].\u201d Dench credits Weinstein with much of her success. The former House of Cards actor Kevin Spacey supported her following the death of her husband, Michael Williams, in 2001. In 2018, it was alleged that Spacey invited the actor Anthony Rapp to a party at his home in 1986, when Spacey was 26 and Rapp was 14. Rapp alleged that Spacey lifted him on to his bed and tried to climb on top of him. Spacey responded to the allegations at the time saying he did not remember the incident, but apologising for it nonetheless. In an online statement, he said: \u201cI honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.\u201d Spacey has since faced other allegations about sexual misconduct. Following the claims, a special Emmy award that was due to be given to Spacey was revoked. The Old Vic, where Spacey was artistic director between 2004 and 2015, expressed its dismay at the allegations against him. Dench was one of the first celebrities to publicly denounce Weinstein after claims against him, saying she was \u201chorrified\u201d by his alleged behaviour. Weinstein was removed from the board of his company and stripped of many accolades after dozens of women came forward to allege that they were sexually assaulted or raped by him. He was indicted on charges of rape and a criminal sexual act in 2018 but pleads not guilty to the claims against him, and has denied any non-consensual sex. In a wide-ranging interview, Dench also spoke to the Radio Times about losing her eyesight and having to stop driving. \u201cI can\u2019t read the paper now, I can\u2019t do the crossword, I can\u2019t read a book,\u201d she says, \u201cbut, you know, you cope. I\u2019ve got people who read to me and coach me with my lines,\u201d she said. She dismissed the discomfort, putting it down to being part of her job: \u201cOn a film set you learn where everything is. It\u2019s OK if you can get away with it. It\u2019s all acting, after all. Fooling people. It\u2019s what I do.\u201d But she described the realisation that she would have to stop driving as traumatising. \u201cIt was absolutely appalling,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I just know I\u2019ll kill somebody if I get behind the wheel of a car now.\u201d Dench does not know what will happen to her eyesight but said she feels more comfortable not knowing the prognosis. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing you can do.

In the world of rugby, meanwhile, 37% of international players were privately educated, and in cricket 43% of the England team went to independent schools. The study, called Elitist Britain 2019, found similar patterns in women\u2019s sport, but it also found that 80% of female international players in football, cricket and rugby had attended university, far higher than in men\u2019s sport. Women continue to be underrepresented in top jobs, but those who make it to the highest echelons are also considerably more likely to have attended a private school than the population at large, though they are less likely to have gone to Oxbridge than their male counterparts. The report identifies a \u201cpipeline\u201d from fee-paying schools through Oxbridge and into top jobs \u2013 52% of senior judges took this route compared with 17% of all those examined. While it found there had been some increase in the diversity of educational backgrounds of those at the top since an equivalent exercise five years ago, change was happening slowly. Luke Heselwood from the Reform thinktank said: \u201cThese scandalous figures show that the UK is far from being a meritocracy. Fixing this will require serious reform to the education system as, despite improvements, the most advantaged are nearly 10 times more likely to attend elite universities than the most disadvantaged.\u201d Dame Martina Milburn, the chair of the Social Mobility Commission, said: \u201cPoliticians, employers and educators all need to work together to ensure that Britain\u2019s elite becomes more diverse in gender, ethnicity and social background. It is time to close the power gap and ensure that those at the top can relate to and represent ordinary people.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe old boys\u2019 network and the old school tie still hold back talented and hard-working people from less privileged backgrounds. Labour will focus on giving every child the chance to flourish, not just a lucky few, focusing on social justice not just social mobility.\u201d A spokesperson for the Independent Schools Council said: \u201cAssumptions about independent schools are far too often based on misconceptions or stereotypes. Many people do not realise that the majority of ISC schools have fewer than 350 pupils, only half are academically selective, and most work in partnership with state schools.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s foremost tax and spending thinktank has said that Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to cut taxes for millions of higher earners would cost \u00a39bn and benefit the richest 10% of households in Britain most. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said the proposal by the frontrunner in the Conservative leadership race was expensive and potentially incompatible with the Tories\u2019 promise to end austerity and safely manage the public finances. Johnson has said he would increase the higher-rate income tax threshold, at which earnings are taxed at 40%, from its current level of \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 should Tory members vote him in as leader. Tom Waters, a research economist at the IFS, said: \u201cIt is not clear that spending such sums on tax cuts is compatible with both ending austerity in public spending and prudent management of the public finances.\u201d Drawing intense criticism from across the political spectrum, the proposal has been roundly attacked as a giveaway for the rich that would drive up inequality and harm the public finances. No-deal Brexit could damage Treasury revenues, while tax cuts would subtract from funding needed to boost public services. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has warned Tory leadership hopefuls against any reckless tax cuts and spending increases. According to the IFS, about 4 million income tax payers with the highest incomes would benefit from Johnson\u2019s tax promise, standing to gain almost \u00a32,500 each on average. There are 32.75 million British workers, while the average salary is about \u00a326,400 a year. About three-quarters of the reduction in tax liabilities would go to those in the top 10% of the income distribution, while 97% of the gains would go to the top 30% highest earners. Johnson has argued that more people are paying tax at the higher rate, while the study showed their numbers have increased by 170% since 1990. Johnson\u2019s policy would slash the number of higher-rate taxpayers by a third to the lowest level since 1990. Undermining a defence that the cut would encourage aspirational workers, serving as a reward for rising up the earnings pyramid, the IFS said that only a quarter of workers in Britain would benefit from the change at any point in their life or live in a household where someone had. It said just 8% of workers would gain from the change in the short term. Wealthy pensioners would stand to benefit in particular. Johnson has said the cuts would be funded partly by raising the national insurance contributions of workers who benefit from the income tax cut. However, retirees do not pay national insurance. The IFS said those over 65 would receive a tax cut about 60% larger than those under 65, entrenching generational inequality. According to a separate report by the IFS, 60- to 74-year-olds on middle incomes already benefit from substantially higher pension payouts and wages. Carl Emmerson, the thinktank\u2019s deputy director, said the report, The Future of Income in Retirement, showed that a combination of generous occupational pension schemes and more people working into old age meant those in the 60-74 age bracket on middle incomes were 60% better off than those in a similar position in the mid-1990s. The current crop of retirees was likely to be a bubble, with the prospect of less generous pension schemes for younger workers acting to depress retirement incomes in decades to come. \u201cFuture generations may actually end up with lower private pensions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is much capacity for employment rates of older individuals to rise further: for example employment rates of men aged 60 to 64, which have been increasing since the mid-1990s, are still well below the rates seen in the 1970s when life expectancy was much lower and health less good.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson broke cover on Monday night, vowing he would never reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds last week, after neighbours reported a loud row between the couple. Amid mounting criticism that the frontrunner in the Conservative leadership campaign has been dodging public scrutiny, Johnson is now understood to be rolling out a \u201cmedia blitz\u201d for the coming days, beginning with five closely controlled events on Tuesday, in an attempt to defy accusations that he is in hiding. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, in his first televised interview since his campaign kicked off more than four weeks ago, a defiant Johnson said it would be \u201cunfair\u201d on his family to comment on his private life. \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones. And there\u2019s a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that, really is, is, in a way that is not fair on them,\u201d he said. Johnson refused to be drawn when accused by Kuenssberg of trying to \u201chave it both ways\u201d after multiple news outlets published a photograph on Monday of him and a smiling Symonds sitting in the Sussex countryside. His team denies the picture was set up and released by them. He defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union, but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement, something which some Conservative Eurosceptics have said they believed he was planning to do. Johnson claimed issues including the Irish border would be tackled \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period\u201d but then was forced to agree that the UK would not be entitled to such an implementation period without signing up to the current withdrawal agreement. His rival for the leadership, Jeremy Hunt, has called for Johnson to face further scrutiny on his Brexit plan and answer questions about the police visit to his home, calling him a \u201cbottler\u201d for refusing to attend a Sky News debate this week. Meanwhile, four Conservative party sources have told the Guardian that Johnson\u2019s campaign team had raised concerns about the extent of media access to the 16 Conservative hustings at a meeting on Friday. However, the party chairman, Brandon Lewis, insisted there must be a livestream of each event. The Guardian spoke to two sources present at the meeting who said objections had been raised by James Wharton, Johnson\u2019s campaign manager, about the media access to the hustings, including questioning why a pool camera had been invited to film proceedings. However, Johnson\u2019s team said they did not make any such demands, insisting all organisational aspects were a matter for Conservative campaign headquarters. A source close to Johnson said there was \u201cno objection from us about allowing media into the hustings \u2013 and of course they are invited to all\u201d. Wharton declined to comment. Another Conservative source said Johnson\u2019s campaign had objected to the media access arrangements for the hustings, but Lewis had insisted at the meeting that the hustings must be allowed to be broadcast and covered properly by the press. After Johnson said he would not take part in a planned Sky News debate with Hunt on Tuesday night, the channel cancelled the programme. It is understood Johnson declined to take part in Sky\u2019s debate because of terms agreed for an ITV debate next week, which the broadcaster has asked be the first head-to-head debate. However, Hunt\u2019s camp pointed out that Johnson had declined all television debates until Conservative members had already begun returning their ballot papers. \u201cBottler Boris and his complacent campaign have shown they can\u2019t trust their candidate to turn up and perform,\u201d a source close to Hunt\u2019s campaign said. A source in Johnson\u2019s team rebuffed claims the ITV debate would be taking place after Tory members had voted, calling it \u201cprime voting time\u201d for when members would be sending back their postal ballots. MP Marcus Fysh, one of Johnson\u2019s supporters, said Hunt\u2019s criticism was ridiculous: \u201cHe is certainly not a coward, as was said by his opponent today in a very negative way.\u201d Hunt also joined calls for Johnson to explain why police were called to his home, saying his rival \u201cneeds to show he can answer difficult questions\u201d. The intervention by the foreign secretary followed cabinet ministers, backbenchers and a major party donor in demanding Johnson speak out about the loud, late-night altercation with Carrie Symonds, which was heard by several neighbours. Police attended the property but left after receiving reassurances from both the individuals in the flat that they were safe. John Griffin, the taxi tycoon who has given \u00a34m to the Tories over the last six years, expressed concerns about the morality of the favourite to become prime minister. \u201cWe deserve an explanation about that row, and he has to handle it properly. He can\u2019t assume that we are going to support him when he has not explained every detail,\u201d he said. Griffin, a Brexiter and founder of Addison Lee, expressed concerns about Johnson\u2019s morality and said he should also come clean about his previous behaviour, including his responsibilities to his children. Johnson has four children by his estranged wife, Marina Wheeler, and a child with a woman with whom he had an affair. However, he has been dogged by unproven claims that he has at least one more child. Johnson has refused to comment. \u201cEach of his children need his love and attention. But he needs to show that he has given it to them. He cannot say that it is irrelevant. It is highly relevant. It is one of the ways you measure a person,\u201d Griffin said. Griffin called for Johnson to address allegations that he had had extramarital affairs and had treated women in those relationships badly. In a tweet on Monday, Hunt said: \u201cThis contest isn\u2019t about personal lives but if you want to lead this country you have to show up and answer questions on your plans for Britain.\u201d Hunt has made a raft of media appearances and spent Monday visiting businesses in the West Country. The foreign secretary, who secured the endorsement of defence secretary Penny Mordaunt, a Brexiter, will promise on Tuesday to create a \u00a315bn \u201cwar chest\u201d of spending on defence rising to 2.5% of GDP in the next five years, up from its current 2%. Hunt said it would show Britain was a \u201cself-confident country ready to defend its interests and values as we embark on an exciting post-Brexit future\u201d.",

Waterfront Toronto\u2019s board chair, Stephen Diamond, said Sidewalk Lab\u2019s plan is \u201cimpressive\u201d but said he was still seeking more information than the plan provides. \u201cThe scale and size of the project does raise some serious issues for us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be looking for support first on Quayside.\u201d Despite Waterfront Toronto\u2019s worries about the plan, Sidewalk Lab\u2019s CEO Dan Doctoroff told the Guardian he is confident he can earn its approval and that of three levels of government, which need to sign off on his proposal for it to become a reality. \u201cMy expectation is that we will be able to work through the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t think that then I certainly wouldn\u2019t waste our time moving forward.\u201d If there are objections to the plan, there is room for change, he acknowledged, but said if the project can\u2019t meet goals Sidewalk Labs sets for sustainability, mobility and economic growth then \u201cwe are not interested\u201d because \u201cthis doesn\u2019t make sense anymore\u201d. He said he was unsurprised by the feedback he has heard so far. \u201cIf we really want to create a new path for inclusive, urban growth, you can\u2019t just wave a wand and say it would be nice to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cYou really have to think through the problems.\u201d Some of those problems have been raised by Jim Balsillie, a former Blackberry CEO who previously authored scathing editorials about Sidewalk Labs\u2019 intellectual property and data proposals. Balsillie has dismissed Sidewalk Lab\u2019s plan as a \u201cgrab for more land, more power and more control\u201d that follows \u201can ugly 18-month public relations charade that weaponized ambiguity\u201d. \u201cThis is not a road map for a smart city, it\u2019s an assault on our democracy,\u201d he wrote in an email to the Guardian. The project has long been a lightning rod for criticism, even attracting a petition calling for Waterfront Toronto to head back to reset the process and seek new proposals for the land. The project was already a lightning rod for criticism before Diamond\u2019s remarks. Several high-profile members of a board established to guide the project have resigned, while others have questioned Sidewalk Lab\u2019s hope to earn a fraction of property taxes and development fees in exchange for building a transit line to the neighbourhood and funding underground infrastructure. Critics have also questioned how Sidewalk Labs will capture and use data in the neighbourhood and how intellectual property rights will be handled. Sidewalk Labs has indicated data collected by cameras and sensors throughout the neighbourhood could be used to help create new technologies, develop efficiencies in city planning and aid sustainability efforts. According to the plan released on Monday, the company will use an independent data trust that would set the rules around data use, make it accessible and offer privacy protections. The trust would also ensure Sidewalk Labs does not receive any special status or rights when it comes to data access. Sidewalk Labs also vowed in the plan not to sell personal information, use such info for advertising or disclose the data to third parties without explicit consent. Diamond said Waterfront Toronto would like more information on data collection and use and digital governance and will continue reviewing the plan and seeking public feedback in the coming weeks. The plan will need approval from three levels of government in addition to Waterfront Toronto and construction probably would not start until 2022. Doctoroff said Sidewalk Labs will also spend more time listening to the public and working with government to reach approval. If the project moves ahead, construction probably would not start until 2022.",

      "bodyText": "A member of an armed group known for stopping migrants at the US-Mexico border has been arrested and charged with impersonating a US border patrol agent. Jim Benvie, spokesman for the Guardian Patriots, a militia that has been camped at the border near Sunland Park, New Mexico, was arrested on Friday in Oklahoma after a warrant was issued on Wednesday in southern New Mexico. The US Department of Justice filed two federal charges, alleging that Benvie, 44, passed himself off as a border patrol agent in mid-April. It was the second arrest to target members of armed groups that have been patrolling the border near Sunland Park since February. In recent years, there have been growing reports of paramilitary groups and xenophobic activists surveilling the US border with Mexico, working to intercept undocumented people trying to cross into the United States. The groups in New Mexico have previously presented themselves as \u201cvolunteers\u201d aiding border patrol andsupporting Donald Trump. News photographs taken in March showed Jim Benvie wearing a camouflage jacket with a badge reading \u201cFugitive Recovery Agent\u201d and a patch with an eagle-head insignia. Several livestream videos posted by Benvie to Facebook in April documented some of the actions of the Guardian Patriots in New Mexico. One video appeared to show the militia ordering around a large group of migrants, including many children, and telling them to sit on the ground.

They don\u2019t care for the constitutional rights and basic human rights of migrants.\u201d In Reuters interviews earlier this year, Benvie denied his group posed as border patrol agents and said he was a citizen journalist documenting proof of the need for the border wall promised by Trump. William Early, an Oklahoma public defender representing Benvie, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Benvie remains in federal custody pending a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday in Oklahoma before his full trial begins in Las Cruces, New Mexico. He also faces a fraud charge in Oklahoma for allegedly running a child-cancer charity scam. In May, the Guardian Patriots split from another armed group on the border, the United Constitutional Patriots (UCP). Larry Hopkins, the leader of the UCP, was arrested in April on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms. \u201cToday\u2019s arrest by the FBI indicates clearly that the rule of law should be in the hands of trained law enforcement officials, not armed vigilantes,\u201d the New Mexico attorney general, Hector Balderas, said in a statement at the time. The ACLU in New Mexico described the group as \u201can armed fascist militia organization\u201d made up of \u201cvigilantes\u201d, saying they were working to \u201ckidnap and detain people seeking asylum\u201d and had directly made illegal arrests and held migrants at gunpoint. Corte said she feared the arrest would not stop other armed vigilantes from traveling to the border, especially as Trump intensifies his anti-immigrant rhetoric on the campaign trail. \u201cThey are saying, \u2018I responded to a call by my president, and I came down to fight this invasion,\u2019\u201d she said, adding that border patrol agents have to \u201cactually do their jobs and stop this\u201d.",

Otherwise, it looks lovely.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1114be8f080e828514eb64\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T18:23:29.804Z\">7.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A peek inside the dressing rooms </strong>tells us that the players get unusually comfy-looking armchairs to sit in:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87e775507c017323017bec838792cb2f33230e80\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87e775507c017323017bec838792cb2f33230e80/0_0_5156_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sweden changing room at Parc des Princes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sweden changing room at Parc des Princes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Ivill/FIFA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T18:38:03.850Z\">at 7.38pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1111988f081e872734e032\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T18:10:49.619Z\">7.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The starting line-ups</strong> in full:</p> <p><strong>Sweden:</strong> Lindahl; Glas, FIscher, Sembrant, Eriksson; Rubensson, Asllani, Seger; Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Rolfo.<br><strong>Canada: </strong>Labbe; Lawrence, Buchanan, Zadorsky, Chapman; Prince, Scott, Schmidt, Beckie; Sinclair, Fleming.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d110e998f081e872734e01f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T17:57:41.117Z\">6.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The line-ups have been announced</strong> on ye olde social media.

Sure, both came second in their groups, but to Netherlands and the USA respectively, which in neither case is exactly a humiliation. Canada won two of their three games and lost 2-1 to Netherlands in a game where they had more possession and more shots, so emerge from the whole business in great credit. Sweden won two of their three games and though they were pretty soundly beaten by the Americans in the last, that only happened after they made seven changes with an eye on this match, and so they also emerge in credit. It should be a close-fought affair, as it was when they played in the third-place play-off of the Algarve Cup in March. On that occasion the game was encouragingly close, if less encouragingly sterile: it ended 0-0, with Canada prevailing on penalties.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a team that always shows up in the big tournaments,\u201d Canada\u2019s Christine Sinclair said of Sweden. \u201cObviously they won the silver medal in the last Olympics. They\u2019re a world-class team, very well-organized with some great players. It\u2019s going to be a great game.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cMy message is relatively simple tomorrow,\u201d said the Swedish captain Caroline Seger. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning or going home. We\u2019ll have to get out there and play at 100% with no regrets when we leave the pitch.\u201d </p> <p>Anyway, hello! Let\u2019s hope this has all the good things about the teams\u2019 last meeting, and also some goals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CanadaSoccerEN/status/1141815508452413440\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Next match: Sweden<br><br>\ud83d\udcfa: CTV, TSN &amp; RDS <br>\ud83d\udccd: Paris \ud83c\uddeb\ud83c\uddf7  <br>\u23f0: 21.00 local / 15.00 ET / 12.00 PT    <br>\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6: <a href=\"https://t.co/Vm97wtss4p\">https://t.co/Vm97wtss4p</a>    <br>\ud83c\udd9a: SWEDEN <br>#\ufe0f\u20e3: \ud83c\udde8\ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddea <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CANWNT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CANWNT</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TogetherWeRise?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TogetherWeRise</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/DareToShine?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#DareToShine</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/TGAZBOUkxU\">pic.twitter.com/TGAZBOUkxU</a></p>&mdash; Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CanadaSoccerEN/status/1141815508452413440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 20, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. The second half was excellent fun. We\u2019ll forget about the first, shall we? Bye! \u201cThe Guardian stats show Canada with no shots on target. The penalty doesn\u2019t count for that?\u201d wonders Mark Schmidt. Official statistics have both teams tied on two on-target shots apiece. Beckie had both of Canada\u2019s, one of them the penalty. So Sweden will play Germany in the quarter-finals, in Rennes on Saturday. And Hedvig Lindahl has been given the player of the match award, which seems a bit puzzling. Sure, she saved a penalty and is generally excellent, but the penalty aside she didn\u2019t have much to do. VAR checks that penalty shout, even after the final whistle. It did hit someone\u2019s elbow, but it was hard against their body. There will be no more penalties. The corner is headed to the edge of the area. A shot comes in, and bounces off a Sweden defender. Canada have their arms up, hoping for another handball-based penalty. The referee blows for full time! 90+9 mins: It\u2019s headed behind for a corner. The referee will let Canada take it! Labb\u00e9 is up! 90+8 mins: In the final second of stoppage time, Glas fouls Lawrence just outside the penalty area, near the byline, on the left. Canada score from this free-kick, or they\u2019re out. Leon will take it. 90+6 mins: Thirty seconds later, the ball is back with Labb\u00e9. She boots it forward, and it runs through to Lindahl. 90+5 mins: Sweden have brought Anvegard on for Blackstenius, their goalscorer. There are two minutes to play and the ball is with Labb\u00e9, Canada\u2019s goalkeeper. 90+4 mins: Jakobsson streaks down the right and pulls the ball back, and it rolls towards Asllani. A chance, a shot and a goal looks inevitable, but Schmidt somehow gets back and spoils things. She has had a great game, though certainly having pink hair makes you likely to notice her. 90+3 mins: There will, by the way, be seven minutes of second-half stoppage time. 90+2 mins: Schmidt has a shot from just inside the area, but it\u2019s off target. 90+1 mins: There\u2019s another, brief, VAR handball penalty review, but this time Sweden get the benefit of the doubt (there wasn\u2019t really much doubt; it wasn\u2019t a handball). 89 mins: Riviere gets into another good position on the right, but mishits her cross straight out of play. Sweden take Rolfo off, and bring Hurtig on. 88 mins: Fine work from Riviere, who has just come on. The shot that follows her pull-back, though, is wild. 86 mins: What a clearance! The ball is curled into the area, Asllani volleys it past Labb\u00e9 and towards the corner of the net, but Scott manages to get her leg in the way! If she had not reached it, Canada were done. 86 mins: Sweden win a free-kick on the right, and Buchanan is booked. She will thus miss the quarter-final, if Canada manage to reach it. 84 mins: A couple of further substitutions: Beckie, Canada\u2019s penalty-fluffer, is off and Rebecca Quinn is on. Also, Chapman is off and Riviere is on. 82 mins: There was a fractional offside in the build-up, and the penalty is disawarded. A low cross from the right rolls to Rolfo, and Lawrence\u2019s attempt to dispossess her from behind is ruled a foul! 80 mins: Save! Asllani plays in a free-kick from the left, one of her team-mates flicks it goalwards and Labb\u00e9 makes a point-blank save! 79 mins: Sweden make their first substitution, taking of Rubensson and bringing on Bjorn. 76 mins: Canada continue to find Sweden\u2019s defence impossible to penetrate. They have had 57% of possession, much of it in Sweden\u2019s half, but have looked less likely to actually score. 73 mins: Buchanan slides in at the near post to stop Blackstenius scoring a second. If ever a game needed a goal, it was this one. And it has been totally transformed. 69 mins: Lindahl dives to her right, gets both hands to the ball and pushes it round the post! Replays show her left foot is absolutely on the line when the kick is taken, so there will be no second chance for Janine Beckie. 68 mins: Asllani\u2019s hand wasn\u2019t just by her side. That, in this cruel, cruel, world that we find ourselves living in. Is a penalty. 67 mins: Scott\u2019s shot hit Asllani\u2019s left arm. i don\u2019t think the arm was very far from her body, but the impact of the ball pushed it out and made that look worse than it was, I think. 66 mins: Canada try to score: Beckie cross from the right and Schmidt is at the near post and heads across goal and wide. 65 mins: The first change of the day sees Canada\u2019s Prince leave the field and Leon enter it. 63 mins: \u201cIs it just me,\u201d wonders Hubert O\u2019Hearn, as Sweden push forward again, \u201cor does the Swedish manager look like the guy in a noir thriller who garottes three victims before being pushed down an elevator shaft?\u201d 60 mins: Sweden have another decent attack. This time Blackstenius tries to return the favour by teeing up Asllani, but the still ubiquitous Schmidt gets back and cleans up. 56 mins: An excellent final pass and a decent finish. Labb\u00e9 onrushed really quite badly there, I think, which helped the scorer a bit. 55 mins: Canada threaten, and keep threatening, and threaten some more. Then a pass is intercepted, it\u2019s moved on to Asllani, she curls a pass to Blackstenius, and she pokes past the onrushing Labb\u00e9! It\u2019s Sweden 1-0 Canada! 53 mins: It is a shot! It\u2019s wide, obviously, but still, just by being an attempt to put the ball in the net it is one of the top three moments of this match. Sinclair it is, who curls her effort a couple of yards wide of the post. 52 mins: Canada have a shot! And might have another shot! Beckie is the shooter, whose 23-yarder flies high and wide, but Asllani fouled her mid-shot so Canada can have another go. 50 mins: Nearly a thing! Sweden push and probe around the Canada penalty area; Beckie wins the ball but then gives it straight away again; Jakobsson gets into the box and prepares to pull the ball back. Then she\u2019s tackled. Corner. 48 mins: I think I\u2019d prefer the lake, all things considered. \u201cApropos that other fella\u2019s Swedish idyll, I\u2019m watching from my local Scottish pub in Stockholm,\u201d writes Jon Collin. \u201cThere are a surprising number of Scottish pubs in Stockholm; this one smells like a stale water closet and is a fairly accurate facsimile of an estate pub in the UK, though I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s what it\u2019s aiming for. The crowd is mainly fellas who\u2019ve been here for several hours. Terrible game, Asllani is frustrating, and Swedish TV is already talking about penalties.\u201d 46 mins: Peeeeep! The same 22 players are having another go at it. Anyway, they\u2019re back out and ready for more. Brace yourself, this is going to be incredible. I shouldn\u2019t be too disparaging. There has been lots of decent football, it\u2019s just that absolutely none of it has happened in either penalty area. Spend the half-time interval of this match reading about a better one: \u201cThe BBC bloke is doing the commentary on his own, poor devil,\u201d notes Charles Antaki. \u201cEither the corporation is saving money, or there actually was a co-commentator and she\u2019s slumped under the table with ennui, or simply walked off in dismay.\u201d He is, at least, getting half-time off. 45+2 mins: It\u2019s over, for now at least. Just another 75 minutes of that before they decide it on penalties. 45+1 mins: There will be about one minute\u2019s stoppage time, though I don\u2019t really know where they found it from. Absolutely nothing has happened. Three free kicks. Some throw-ins. The occasional corner. 45 mins: Another foul! And a booking! Rolfo is booked for landing her foot on Scott\u2019s ankle, though there didn\u2019t seem to be much intent. 44 mins: Another foul! Lawrence is judged to have fouled Asllani, though I thought it could easily have gone the other way. 42 mins: Asllani keeps the ball for an unforgivable amount of time in midfield and eventually loses it, gifting Prince the chance to release Sinclair. Which she doesn\u2019t take. 40 mins: Another first: a foul. There has been only one. According to the official statistics, Canada have only made three tackles. 38 mins: I think we might have just had a shot on target, though given that it was a header from 25 yards that only just rolled as far as Labb\u00e9, it\u2019s probably best not to get too excited. 36 mins: Sweden win another corner, which Labb\u00e9 unconvincingly flaps clear. 35 mins: The game\u2019s official hashtag, #SWECAN, demands to be preceded with #CANWEKICKITYE 34 mins: Sweden win their first corner (Canada have had four). Jakobsson heads it way wide. 33 mins: Schmidt\u2019s excellent looping through-ball finds Sinclair, but her first touch is not great, forces her to turn back, and the chance is gone. 30 mins: The frustration! Prince is released on the right by a lovely pass; three team-mates run into the area to her left; her cross, with great precision, picks out the only part of the area which none of them could possibly reach. 28 mins: The combined efforts of both teams has, so far as I can recall, resulted in approximately one kick in an opposing team\u2019s penalty area. And that was rubbish. Very much a day for defences so far. \u201cI took Julian Menz\u2019s advice and looked up Lake Siljan on the map,\u201d says Peter Oh. \u201cIt looks like the drive there from Stockholm takes you through the towns of SolVARbo and KVARnsveden. The signs are there for all to see!\u201d 26 mins: Beckie is released on the left, controls the ball, sizes up Fischer, the only person between her and the penalty area, and then runs, with the ball, off the pitch. This is frustrating. 22 mins: Another shot! Fleming half-volleys wildly, after a high cross bounced kindly off Schmidt, who never seems to be more than 10 yards from the ball. 20 mins: A decent Canada attack ends with Schmidt\u2019s poke through for the onrushing Chapman running out of play. \u201cTruly love the Canadian women\u2019s team,\u201d sniffs Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI\u2019m eternally grateful to them for making me a fan of the women\u2019s game 10-15 years ago as their matches were shown on Canadian TV. Emigration to the UK changed many old loyalties, but not this one. Go Canada Go!\u201d 18 mins: And a shooting chance for Jakobsson and Sweden, who bursts past two opponents in midfield, runs at a backtracking defence but then drags her shot wide from 20 yards. It is the first shot of the game, more than a sixth of the way through. 17 mins: Good work from Asllani on the right, who controls a throw-in, turns and outmuscles Beckie, who falls over, before sending in an excellent cross, but it drops to Schmidt who boots clear. 13 mins: Now Beckie rampages down the left, but Glas gets back to snuff out the danger just as it was starting to look really dangerous, at the expense of a corner. 11 mins: Suddenly, the Swedes threaten. Seger passes to Jakobsson in the area and for a moment a great chance looks inevitable. But Buchanan is alert and swoops to steal the ball away. 10 mins: Now Rolfo does well to end a once-promising Canada attack on the Swedish left flank. Canada have had much the better of the last few minutes, though. 7 mins: Canada win a corner, which Beckie floats to the far post, over Lindahl\u2019s desperate flailing hand, where it\u2019s headed behind for another one. This one comes off Schmidt\u2019s pink hair and goes behind for a goal kick. 6 mins: Sinclair closes down Lindahl, whose attempt to chip the ball over her opponent and to a team-mate is overhit, and results in a Canada throw. 5 mins: So far every forward pass since that early Asllani overhead has been capably dealt with by this or that defender, Glas being the latest. We\u2019re very much still in the early sparring stage. 3 mins: Lawrence controls a poor pass quite beautifully on the right flank, and then overhits her own pass straight out of play. 1 mins: Sweden start on the front foot, but Asllani\u2019s overhead flick bounces too far ahead of Blackstenius, and Labb\u00e9 comes out to claim. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Sweden get the game started, Asllani doing the honours. The anthems have been sung and coins have been tossed. Football is but a few moments away. The Swedish anthem is being sung. As the players line up I\u2019m reminded of how disappointed I\u2019ve been with the mascots\u2019 kit for this tournament. It looks like nobody thought about it until about 15 minutes before the first game, and were then extremely relieved to find something vaguely acceptable in the back of a cupboard. \u201cAllow me to paint a picture,\u201d writes Julian Menz. \u201cA stone\u2019s throw to the shore of beautiful Lake Siljan (three hours from Stockholm, google it). Sun shining, the lake almost mirror-like. Sat with my Swedish wife\u2019s family and a (worryingly large and increasing) number of friends. We have BBQ-d, we have beer and wine (Swedes tend to bring their own, but hej, we have no close neighbours). I just hope tonight\u2019s match doesn\u2019t descend into yet another VAR farce.\u201d Yeah, good luck with that. The players are in the tunnel, and looking forward to some damn fine anthem-singing. Here\u2019s some pre-match reading, courtesy of Eni Aluko: They have to share the arms on their armchairs, though, like in the economy section of an aeroplane. That must be annoying. Every half-time must turn into a competition to be the first to jab out your elbows and claim the shared arms. And maybe some drink-holders would come in handy, too, given that the occupants of the dressing-rooms will often be engaged in rehydration. Otherwise, it looks lovely. A peek inside the dressing rooms tells us that the players get unusually comfy-looking armchairs to sit in: The starting line-ups in full: Sweden: Lindahl; Glas, FIscher, Sembrant, Eriksson; Rubensson, Asllani, Seger; Jakobsson, Blackstenius, Rolfo. Canada: Labbe; Lawrence, Buchanan, Zadorsky, Chapman; Prince, Scott, Schmidt, Beckie; Sinclair, Fleming. The line-ups have been announced on ye olde social media. I\u2019ll get a basic textual version to you shortly. Hello world! A meeting between Canada, fifth in Fifa\u2019s rankings, and Sweden, No9, looks like a stonking round-of-16 match-up. Sure, both came second in their groups, but to Netherlands and the USA respectively, which in neither case is exactly a humiliation. Canada won two of their three games and lost 2-1 to Netherlands in a game where they had more possession and more shots, so emerge from the whole business in great credit. Sweden won two of their three games and though they were pretty soundly beaten by the Americans in the last, that only happened after they made seven changes with an eye on this match, and so they also emerge in credit. It should be a close-fought affair, as it was when they played in the third-place play-off of the Algarve Cup in March. On that occasion the game was encouragingly close, if less encouragingly sterile: it ended 0-0, with Canada prevailing on penalties. \u201cThey\u2019re a team that always shows up in the big tournaments,\u201d Canada\u2019s Christine Sinclair said of Sweden. \u201cObviously they won the silver medal in the last Olympics. They\u2019re a world-class team, very well-organized with some great players. It\u2019s going to be a great game.\u201d \u201cMy message is relatively simple tomorrow,\u201d said the Swedish captain Caroline Seger. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning or going home. We\u2019ll have to get out there and play at 100% with no regrets when we leave the pitch.\u201d Anyway, hello! Let\u2019s hope this has all the good things about the teams\u2019 last meeting, and also some goals.",

The Australia Institute reviewed 18 years of tax policy and found wage earners at all levels had been overcompensated for bracket creep, with income tax cut by larger amounts than the tax increased owing to moving up a bracket. Including the government\u2019s planned flat tax of 30% for people earning between $45,000 and $200,000, the thinktank estimates someone earning $60,000 would be $1,919 a year better off compared with if tax thresholds had just been increased to account for inflation. But someone on $125,000 would be $7,035 a year better off and someone on $200,000 was $19,785 better off.</p> <p><strong>Donald Trump has ordered new sanctions against Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei</strong>, in the latest step <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/24/mike-pompeo-us-saudi-arabia-talks-iran-united-arab-emirates-tensions\">of an escalating campaign</a> against Tehran.<strong> </strong>Sanctions have also been issued against eight Revolutionary Guard commanders.

Pakistan have been traditionally variable. Sri Lanka put in some feeble performances before swarming the tournament host. West Indies flattered, then were flattened.</p> <p>And when England play Australia at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday, there is a sense that it will answer questions about both teams. For England\u2019s part, whether they will flourish or falter when the pressure really starts to build. For Australia\u2019s, whether this current team can really mount a credible challenge for the trophy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/24/england-cricket-world-cup-news-australia\">Eoin Morgan declines to ask England fans not to boo Smith and Warner</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Australia, there is at least no intimidation at untrodden ground. Winning the thing is almost humdrum. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve got six guys in our squad who were part of the 2015 World Cup win is really valuable,\u201d said the captain, Aaron Finch, in understated fashion. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got Ricky Ponting with us, Brad Haddin with us, as coaching staff who have won World Cups, and multiple World Cups as well.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Finch\u2019s team looked like a rabble and even through this tournament there has been a sense of disjointedness to how the batting order is composed and what roles batsmen are there to play. Yet the team have found a way past most opponents. \u201cI think over World Cup history Australia have had that record of peaking at the right time of the tournament,\u201d said Finch.</p> <p>Taking on England will offer a test of whether that is the case this time round. Of the other teams in the top four, Australia were well beaten by India and are yet to play New Zealand. England, despite stumbles against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, are still a power-packed lineup that do not take kindly to defeat, with a recent record of bouncing back after a lost match in spectacular fashion.</p> <p>Lord\u2019s, though, is far from the best venue for the kind of high-risk, high-reward approach of modern England. The pitches tend to be slower and scoring rates lower, especially for new batsmen.</p> <p>On the evidence of the venue\u2019s first World Cup date, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/23/pakistan-south-africa-cricket-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">when Pakistan beat South Africa</a>, these pitches are taking spin as well. With fast bowlers going for plenty of runs and Imran Tahir low on overs, South Africa turned to Aiden Markram\u2019s very part-time spin through the middle overs of Sunday\u2019s game and found he turned the ball appreciably. Pakistan\u2019s spinners also made telling contributions.</p> <p>\u201cI think we saw as the game went on it started to turn a little bit more than we probably expected,\u201d Finch said. \u201cIt looked like there was a little bit in it to start with, and then it dried out and sort of powdered up and started turning.\u201d</p> <p>The logical upshot is Australia might have to defy their own convention and play the off-spinner Nathan Lyon alongside the leg\u2011spinner Adam Zampa. Lyon has had nothing to do in this tournament except sing anthems and ferry beverages. Nathan Coulter-Nile, the first choice for the third fast bowler, has contributed only four wickets in five matches and has often struggled with his accuracy, while Lyon has recently shown a mastery at suffocating the scoring through the middle of an innings.

      "bodyText": "Even two-thirds of the way through the Cricket World Cup group stage we are still waiting for teams to peel off their false moustaches and reveal who they really are. Pakistan have been traditionally variable. Sri Lanka put in some feeble performances before swarming the tournament host. West Indies flattered, then were flattened. And when England play Australia at Lord\u2019s on Tuesday, there is a sense that it will answer questions about both teams. For England\u2019s part, whether they will flourish or falter when the pressure really starts to build. For Australia\u2019s, whether this current team can really mount a credible challenge for the trophy. For Australia, there is at least no intimidation at untrodden ground. Winning the thing is almost humdrum. \u201cThe fact that we\u2019ve got six guys in our squad who were part of the 2015 World Cup win is really valuable,\u201d said the captain, Aaron Finch, in understated fashion. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got Ricky Ponting with us, Brad Haddin with us, as coaching staff who have won World Cups, and multiple World Cups as well.\u201d Last year Finch\u2019s team looked like a rabble and even through this tournament there has been a sense of disjointedness to how the batting order is composed and what roles batsmen are there to play. Yet the team have found a way past most opponents. \u201cI think over World Cup history Australia have had that record of peaking at the right time of the tournament,\u201d said Finch. Taking on England will offer a test of whether that is the case this time round. Of the other teams in the top four, Australia were well beaten by India and are yet to play New Zealand. England, despite stumbles against Sri Lanka and Pakistan, are still a power-packed lineup that do not take kindly to defeat, with a recent record of bouncing back after a lost match in spectacular fashion. Lord\u2019s, though, is far from the best venue for the kind of high-risk, high-reward approach of modern England. The pitches tend to be slower and scoring rates lower, especially for new batsmen. On the evidence of the venue\u2019s first World Cup date, when Pakistan beat South Africa, these pitches are taking spin as well. With fast bowlers going for plenty of runs and Imran Tahir low on overs, South Africa turned to Aiden Markram\u2019s very part-time spin through the middle overs of Sunday\u2019s game and found he turned the ball appreciably. Pakistan\u2019s spinners also made telling contributions. \u201cI think we saw as the game went on it started to turn a little bit more than we probably expected,\u201d Finch said. \u201cIt looked like there was a little bit in it to start with, and then it dried out and sort of powdered up and started turning.\u201d The logical upshot is Australia might have to defy their own convention and play the off-spinner Nathan Lyon alongside the leg\u2011spinner Adam Zampa. Lyon has had nothing to do in this tournament except sing anthems and ferry beverages. Nathan Coulter-Nile, the first choice for the third fast bowler, has contributed only four wickets in five matches and has often struggled with his accuracy, while Lyon has recently shown a mastery at suffocating the scoring through the middle of an innings. In the warm-up match against England in Southampton Lyon got through his 10 overs at a cost of 37 runs. Of course, Australian managers are more conservative than any in routinely picking three fast bowlers, especially if Ponting in his coaching role is currently as influential as it appears. Ponting captaining spinners was like a grumpy cop in a buddy comedy teaming up with a flamboyant lounge singer or a rascally dog: he didn\u2019t want them, didn\u2019t trust them, and grudgingly accepted their presence to get a job done. Except in Ponting\u2019s film there were no eventual scenes of bonding and acceptance, where the real Ashes were the friends we made along the way. Adaptability has not necessarily been a strong point for Australia in this campaign, with wins coming match by match based on the pure quality of some of the players, rather than a finely tuned execution of strategy. But against England\u2019s aggressive batting, having the ability to change things up is key. The blue-chip pace pair of Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins pick themselves, but the supporting cast of Lyon, Zampa, medium pace from Marcus Stoinis and more spin from Glenn Maxwell might be the more useful mix than the standard three-pronged pace. Whether selectors can be that adaptable is a different question. It is the old question of what your opponent would least prefer you to do. Given the home team\u2019s stop-start campaign, their recent record at Lord\u2019s, and the nature of the wicket on Sunday, an answer isn\u2019t too hard to guess. With four wins in the bank, two more needed, and three games to play, England in this World Cup are very close to having a problem.

From a price perspective, bitcoin has recovered more than 50% off its losses from its all-time high of $20,000.

      "bodyText": "And finally.... the US stock market had closed for the day. But there\u2019s not much excitement on Wall Street. The Dow Jones ended the day up a meagre 11 points, or 0.04% (squint and you miss it), while the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell around 0.2% each. With the Iranian sanctions applied, investors are now hoping for a breakthrough in the US-China trade war later this week, when G20 leaders gather. In the meantime, Trump\u2019s accusation of incompetence at the Federal Reserve hasn\u2019t dampened expectations of a Fed rate cut in July (if only to quieten the White House for a bit). Goodnight! GW Some experts are suggesting that America\u2019s new sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and eight senior military commanders are more symbolic than practical. Here\u2019s Bloomberg\u2019s take: The penalties won\u2019t have a significant impact on a country that\u2019s already in recession and facing heavy sanctions from the U.S. Still, the new restrictions serve as symbolic reprimand for the attacks, according to former Treasury officials. \u201cIt will have an effect because it will annoy the Iranians and make negotiations hard to pull off if the supreme leader is sanctioned,\u201d said Brian O\u2019Toole, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who previously worked in the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s sanctions unit. Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the \u201cstubborn, childish\u201d Federal Reserve is weighing on the US dollar. The greenback has dropped by 0.2% against a basket of currencies, nudging the euro up to $1.139. Investors may feel the president\u2019s criticism will force Fed policymakers to cut interest rates more than once in the coming months, to avoid further tweetblasts. The oil price has dipped back in late trading - perhaps traders are relieved that America has only hit Iran with sanctions, not military action. Brent crude (sourced from the North Sea) is down 0.9% at $64.64 per barrel). US crude is flat at $57.50 per barrel. Here\u2019s the executive order against Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and those in his office. Plus the moment it was signed: Wall Street is taking the new Iranian sanctions in its stride. The Dow is still positive, up 48 points at 26,767 points, as New York traders grab lunch. President Trump has now signed an executive order in the Oval Office that he said will deny Iran\u2019s supreme leader and others access to financial instruments. Trump told reporters: \u201cWe do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country. I can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon. The comes a few days after Iran shot down a US drone. The president played down the link, saying fresh sanctions were coming already, but added: \u201cI think a lot of restraint has been shown by us but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to show it in the future.\u201d It\u2019s official: America is imposing new sanctions on Iran, which target Tehran\u2019s supreme leader, and top officials. Mark Knoller of CBS has the details: In the City, the FTSE 100 index of top blue-chip shares has closed just 9 points higher at 7,416. It was a largely subdued day, with the weak German business confidence data hitting sentiment. More (sceptical) reaction: A quick recap: President Donald Trump has fired another salvo of criticism at America\u2019s central bankers, claiming they have damaged stock prices and economic growth. In a twitter flurry, Trump claimed the Federal Reserve \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing\u201d and raised interest rates too quickly. Comparing the Fed to a \u201cstubborn child\u201d (?!) for not cutting borrowing costs by now, Trump tweeted: \u201cThink of what it could have been if the Fed had gotten it right.\u201d Trump also hinted that America could withdraw military support from the Gulf region, claiming that China and Japan should take a bigger lead in protecting oil shipments in the area. The comments came as oil prices hit three-week highs, as investors braced for new US sanctions on Iran. Trump\u2019s Iranian ambassador has now weighed in, suggesting an international \u201ctanker protection force\u201d in the wake of recent Gulf attacks. This is helping to pull crude prices lower -- Brent is back below $65 per barrel. Bitcoin has also been surging, hitting a 15-month high over $11,000 overnight. Experts say Facebook\u2019s new Libra currency is reigniting interest in cryptocoins. German business confidence, though, has hit its lowest level in four years - signalling weakness in the euro area. Donald Trump\u2019s attack on the Federal Reserve today is just the \u201clatest diatribe\u201d in \u201clong-running attack\u201d against the central bank So warns the Financial Times: He has over the past year called the central bank his \u201cbiggest threat\u201d and said he was \u201cnot even a little bit happy\u201d with chairman Jay Powell. Earlier this month, he said the Fed was being \u201cvery, very disruptive\u201d by raising interest rates too fast and giving China an edge in trade negotiations as a result. The criticism comes even after the Fed last week signalled a strong possibility of cutting rates this year and some central bank members argued for immediate action to cut them in order to counter weak growth momentum and inflation. Britain and America\u2019s stock markets remain \u201cblandly positive this Monday despite Trump\u2019s inflammatory remarks regarding both the Fed and the Strait of Hormuz\u201d, comments Connor Campbell of City firm SpreadEx. Donald Trump has also won a legal battle over his steel tariffs, although it\u2019s not the end of the matter. Supreme Court judges have turned down a challenge from US companies who said they were suffering higher prices and \u201congoing harm\u201d because of the tariff regime (which makes imports of steel more expensive). Associated Press has the details: The Supreme Court is rejecting an early challenge to President Donald Trump\u2019s authority to impose tariffs on imported steel based on national security concerns. The justices did not comment on Monday in leaving in place a decision by the Court of International Trade that ruled against steel importers and other users of imported steel who challenged the 25% tariff on steel that Trump imposed in 2018. The importers argue that Trump does not have unbounded authority under the Constitution to regulate trade. They say that job belongs to Congress. The legal challenge is at an early stage, before a federal appeals court has weighed in. The case could return to the Supreme Court later. Donald Trump is right about one thing, though - this has been a vintage month for the stock market. The Dow Jones is up nearly 8% this month, which the president called \u201cone of the best\u201d June\u2019s in US history. It\u2019s actually the best in over 80 years, since June 1938, when the Dow surged by an astonishing 24.3%. This month\u2019s rally follows a torrid May, and was sparked by suggestions of US interest rate cuts and fresh stimulus in the eurozone. As Marketwatch puts it: The rally for equities has been partly supported by the Fed, which concluded its Wednesday rate-setting meeting by signaling a willingness too trim rates as soon as the end of the July 30-31 gathering to curb the effects of tariff clashes between the U.S. and international trade partners, notably China, that have roiled global economies and threaten to disrupt global supply chains. Ding ding! The New York stock market is open, and shares are rising despite geopolitical tensions in the Gulf. The Dow Jones industrial average (which tracks 30 of the biggest US companies) has gained 77 points or 0.3% in early trading to 26,796. That takes it closer to last year\u2019s record highs. The S&amp;P 500 (the broader stocks index) has gained just 1 point to 2,951 -- having hit its own record highs last week. Donald Trump\u2019s tweetstorm failed to address the fact that his trade dispute with China has been weighing on markets for some time. Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood, points out that investors are hoping for a breakthrough at the G20 meeting of world leaders on Friday and Saturday. The meeting of Presidents Xi and Trump at the G20 gathering later this week will be critical. Most likely, Trump will back away to some extent from the sharp increase in tariffs planned for early July. But a full-blown trade deal looks very unlikely. With equities riding high, the pressure on Trump to reach an early deal has been reduced. In the meantime, hopes of US interest rate cuts are keeping markets buoyant, he adds. One of the president\u2019s top advisors, Kellyanne Conway, has been discussing Iran at the White House: Donald Trump is now turning his attention to America\u2019s central bankers, accusing them of incompetence. In another Twitter blast from the White House, Trump claims the Fed has hurt US growth by leaving interest rates too high. He claims GDP could be growing at up to 5% per year, not the 3.1% per year recorded in the first quarter of 2019. The Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates in July, in response to slowing growth and weak inflation. That\u2019s unlikely to win them any plaudits from Trump, who has been banging the rate cut drum for months (and now looks vindicated). Does Donald Trump really want Chinese and Japanese warships cruising around the Persian Gulf? It\u2019s only recently they were engaged in cat-and-mouse manoeuvres around the Senkaku Islands..... Doug Saunders of the Globe and Mail points out that Japan\u2019s navy isn\u2019t allowed to head off into international action anyway. The Atlantic\u2019s David Frum also has concerns.... Bloomberg\u2019s Stephen Stapczynski is querying the president\u2019s math(s): Newsflash: President Trump has tweeted that America could withdraw its military protection from the Strait of Hormuz (the area where several tankers have been attacked in recent weeks). Trump wants China and Japan to step up and protect the ships passing through the Gulf, pointing out that they consume much of the oil. That may alarm the financial markets -- without US military protection, the Middle East waterways could become more dangerous. Donald Trump\u2019s clampdown on Iranian oil seems to be having some success. New figures show that Iran only exported 300,000 barrels per day this month, down from around 500,000 bpd in May. It had been shifting 2.5 million barrels per day last year, before the US sanctions kicked in. European stock markets have subsided into the red, after a generally quiet morning. The main indices are all down, as this morning\u2019s drop in German business confidence worries traders. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says investors are keeping their heads down until the G20 meeting later this week, where the presidents of China and the US will meet. All the attention will be on Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping and whether they can dial down the mood music on trade which of late has been set at death metal levels. \u201cThe outcome could help set the tone for the markets over the remainder of the summer. Carsten Brzeski of ING has spotted that German business confidence has hit a four year low, according to this morning\u2019s IFO report. Business expectations have slumped, with company bosses expecting turbulence in the months ahead due to trade conflicts and a slowdown in America\u2019s economy. Brzeski writes: Fear of losing. This is the best summary of the current state of Germany\u2019s businesses. Germany\u2019s most prominent leading indicator, the Ifo index, just dropped for the third month in a row, falling to the lowest level in more than four years. The Ifo index stood at 97.4 in June, from 97.9 in May. While the current assessment component actually increased, the expectations component fell back, close to its recent low at the beginning of the year. Once again, it is well-known uncertainties that are weighing on German business sentiment. Losing one mayoral race is a misfortune. Losing the same one twice is positively careless. That\u2019s where Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan finds himself this morning, after Turkey\u2019s opposition party dramatically won a rerun of the Istanbul mayoral election yesterday. This is the second time that the People\u2019s Republican party (CHP) has beaten Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling AKP party -- the initial result having been annulled. Losing twice (and by a wider margin the second time) is a big blow to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s authority. In response, Turkish assets are rallying today, sending its BIST 100 stock index up by 1.4%. The Turkish lira has also strengthened, along with bond prices. Ergodan has worried global investors in recent months, by undermining central bank independence and making his son-in-law the finance minister. The Istanbul defeat could trigger a re-shaping of Turkish politics, new mayor Ekrem Imamoglu being cited as a possible presidential rival. Environmental news: health and beauty chain Boots is banning plastic bags at its UK stores. Instead customers will get paper ones - at between 5p and 10p each, depending on size, as Boots joins the ranks of companies trying to restrict plastic waste. Bitcoin is still trading at its highest levels for 15 months, up nearly 1% today at $10,918. Some crypto-currency experts are predicting that bitcoin could keep rallying, having already doubled in value in the last seven weeks. Glen Goodman, author of The Crypto Traders, says: \u201cDespite this year\u2019s huge price rise, google searches for \u2018Bitcoin\u2019 are still a lot lower than they were during the last boom. This suggests the price has the potential to go far higher than its current level if the wider public becomes interested again. Though of course, it could be argued that lacking wider public involvement, the current price rise is simply down to blind optimism by the small crypto community who see it as their pain-free path to early retirement.\u201d After the recent parabolic rise, many traders will be looking to take some profits off the table now, but it\u2019s worth remembering that last time Bitcoin\u2019s price broke through $10,000, it then hit it\u2019s all time high of nearly $20,000 just 16 days later.\u201d Naeem Aslam of Think Markets also sees signs that bitcoin could rise sharply higher, as investors who have bet against bitcoin get their fingers burned. This is a strong comeback, everyone has been waiting for this for a long time. From a price perspective, bitcoin has recovered more than 50% off its losses from its all-time high of $20,000. The strong resurgence in the bitcoin price is mainly due to the renewed mainstreaming interest in crypto currencies and the technology which underlines it. Projects like Facebook\u2019s Libra has provided much needed tailwind for this space. I do think the next rally is going to be a lot more stronger than the previous one, one can call it a bubble, but this time the range could very well be between $60,000 to $100,000. However, Michael Hewson of CMC Markets is more sceptical - pointing out that Facebook\u2019s move into crypto-currencies is controversial: While some have lauded this move as a welcome attempt to disrupt the payments industry, having received the backing of Visa and Mastercard, there still remains the worry of what the company might do with users personal data, where Facebook has been on the receiving end of a backlash over how it uses the data it collects. This does raise the inevitable concern that if you\u2019re reluctant to share your personal data with Facebook, why on earth would you trust it with your money? This slump in German business confidence reinforces concerns that the global economy is faltering. This is spurring a rally in government bonds, as the markets anticipate lower growth and weaker inflation. The amount of sovereign debt trading above its face value is at record levels, suggesting investors are trying to protect capital rather than seeking earnings growth [Around $11 trillion of bonds are now on offer at negative yields, or interest rates] It\u2019s a worrying sign that a recession may be on the horizon, as the Wall Street Journal reports today: The collapse in bond yields since this spring has been stark, swift and global, prompting a rush to lock in low rates that few expected to see this deep into a decadelong economic expansion. But share price are also holding up, on hopes that central bankers will ease monetary policy and offer more \u2018easy money\u2019 to support growth, and asset prices. This is an unusual situation -- typically, shares and bonds should move in opposite directions. So, this correlation suggests markets are anticipating that central bankers will save the day again. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, say this may not happen. Bond markets appear to be signaling an economic slowdown, while equities suggest growth will continue in a low-inflation, \u201cGoldilocks\u201d scenario. These seemingly contradictory stories only make sense if the bond market is pricing preemptive Fed rate cuts and the equity market is pricing that this action will succeed in preventing a slowdown. Since 2009, the Fed has proven generally successful at pivoting the right way, but we are wary of positioning for perfection. Here\u2019s Associated Press\u2019 take on the decline in German business morale: A closely watched survey is showing that German business confidence has fallen to a near five-year low as managers\u2019 expectations for the coming six months have deteriorated. The Ifo institute said Monday that its monthly confidence index slipped to 97.4 points in June from 97.9 last month, in line with market expectations. The third straight monthly fall takes the index to its lowest since November 2014 and was entirely due to managers\u2019 waning views of future prospects. Their assessment of the current situation rose modestly from May. German growth forecasts have been cut repeatedly recently and the economy is expected to turn in a feeble performance in the second quarter after returning to growth in the winter. Ifo\u2019s survey is based on responses from some 9,000 firms. IFO president Clemens Fuest is discussing today\u2019s German business confidence figures on Bloomberg TV now. He says the US-China trade war, and the damage from the diesel emissions scandal, are both weighing on Germany\u2019s economy. Trade war and uncertainty over tariffs are one burden on the economy. It would help if there was an agreement [between the US and China], particularly on more reliable long-term rules on trade. Fuest also suggests Germany\u2019s government should cut the tax burden to boost growth, rather than rely on the European Central Bank to crank up its stimulus programme again. Germany should cut corporate and personal tax rates... I don\u2019t think monetary policy will save us. German business confidence has now fallen steadily since May, as this chart from IFO shows: Just in: German business morale has fallen, for the third month in a row. IFO, the Munich-based research group, has reported that its business climate index has dropped to 97.4, from 97.9 in May. Both manufacturers and service sector companies reported that the business climate has worsened in June. IFO warns that German companies have grown increasingly pessimistic about the coming months, which is a negative signal for the eurozone\u2019s prospects. Ifo president Clemens Fuest says: \u201cThe German economy is heading for the doldrums\u201d Here\u2019s some early reaction: However... Germany\u2019s stock market is underperforming the rest of Europe, down around 0.25%. Carmakers are dragging the DAX index down, after Daimler (-3.7%) hit shareholders with a profits warning. Daimler expects earnings to be hundreds of millions of euros below forecasts, due to the long-running damage from the diesel emissions scandal. It\u2019s the third profits warning from Daimler, which produces Mercedes-Benz vehicles, this year. European stock markets are creeping higher in early trading, with US-Iranian tensions lingering. The FTSE 100 is up 12 points, with insurance group Admiral (+3%) leading the risers after a broker upgrade. JD Sports (+2.9%) is also making the early running. Craig Erlam of trading firm OANDA also believes Facebook\u2019s Libra is giving bitcoin a boost: The publicity that the [Libra] launch has once again brought to the space combined with the legitimacy is offers has understandably excited the community and we\u2019ve seen before that you don\u2019t get a normal response when this happens. Whether it actually endorses something like bitcoin or not is perhaps not that important right now, particularly to those that have never lost the faith. It late 2017 is anything to go by, the coming weeks could be a wild ride. Bitcoin clambered as high as $11,247 on the Bitstamp exchange in Luxembourg, before dipping back a little. This surge is reminiscent of the 2017 bitcoin craze, which ended badly: Neil Wilson of Markets.com believes the current rally will fizzle out too - eventually.... All that glitters is not gold. Bitcoin is sparkling again but beware...breakdown\u2019s coming up \u2018round the bend. Bitcoin jumped above $11,000, taking it to its highest level since March 2018. Futures are back down to $10,855 around send time. Investors are ignoring what happened the last time we saw parabolic rises like this. Is it different this time? No, but people have short memories. Facebook\u2019s Libra white paper may have stoked renewed interest in cryptos at a time when the buzz had already returned. Bitcoin is more mature etc, but the fundamentals of this scheme remain unaltered. What I would say is that arguably big money is starting to view this differently and think it could be very costly to ignore if they get left behind.... Bears could get burned before the market turns - maybe better to wait and let it fizzle out, which it will eventually. The more it rallies, the bigger the blow-up when it comes. However, we should expect some pullbacks and retracements along the way. Cryptocurrency bitcoin has smashed through the $11,000 mark for the first time since early 2018 - as money flows back into digital currencies. Bitcoin has now doubled in value since the start of May, profiting those who didn\u2019t lose faith in its prospects after its tumble in 2018 [when it fell from $20,000 to just over $3,000]. So what\u2019s changed? Analysts and crypto-cheerleaders argue that public acceptance of digital currencies is on the rise -- especially with Facebook planning its own currency, Libra. As Jehan Chu, co-founder of Kenetic Capital, an investor in blockchain start-ups told CNBC: \u201cThe price surge is due to two major factors, one is an increasing consensus among the investment community that bitcoin is a legitimate store of value for the digital age, and two Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency launch has forced every CEO to take crypto seriously,\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. The threat of military conflict between the US and Iran is weighing on financial markets today, at the start of a crunch week for the global economy. The oil price has hit a new three-week high this morning, with Brent touching $65.79 per barrel for the first time this month. Stocks are also under pressure, as investors eye safe-haven assets such as gold. With Donald Trump vowing to impose more sanctions on Iran today (following the shooting down of a US drone), traders are anticipating rising tensions in the Gulf. John Bolton, White House national security adviser, also fired a verbal shot at Tehran yesterday, warning Iran against complacency. \u201cNeither Iran nor any other hostile actor should mistake US prudence and discretion for weakness. No one has granted them a hunting licence in the Middle East.\u201d It\u2019s not clear how Iran will retaliate against tougher US sanctions. But following recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman \u2013 a huge oil trading route \u2013 the markets fear supply disruption. Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management explains: The geopolitical escalation in the Middle East is unquestionably a bullish short-term signal for oil markets, as even the thought of 20 % of the world oil supply being affected is enough to trigger significant tremors across oil markets. After a mixed session in Asia, European markets are expected to be subdued this morning. Investors are also looking ahead to the G20 meeting of world leaders at the end of this week, where Trump is expected to discuss the US-China trade war with president Xi. Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group doesn\u2019t expect a major breakthrough over the G20 bread rolls: In the dearth of major economic news, the investors\u2019 attention shifts to the political agenda at the start of the week. Besides the Iranian tensions, the upcoming G20 meeting brings the trade war between the US and China back on the table. While Trump and Xi are expected to meet at this week\u2019s summit in Osaka, the chances of a trade deal between the two countries remain slim.

Aaron Beard throttled through to his best first-class haul of four for 23, including four wickets in 13 balls, and Jamie Porter took five for 51, on the day that both signed two-year contract extensions with <strong>Essex</strong>. Beard, 21, only got his chance in the side because of injury to Sam Cook. Essex were 164 for six at the close, Alastair Cook top scorer with 47, the lead a more-than-healthy 249.</p> <p>The match between <strong>Surrey </strong>and <strong>Warwickshire </strong>moved along quickly on a gloomy day at The Oval as Warwickshire were dismissed for 230, with three wickets for Sam Curran on his comeback after injury. There were three wickets for Jordan Clark and Morne Morkel too, the trio fiendishly unplayable under floodlights. Mark Stoneman led the Surrey reply with 71; Jeetan Patel chipped in with two wickets.</p> <p><strong>Glamorgan </strong>lost three quick late afternoon wickets after Marnus Labuschagne and Nick Selman had put on 95 for the second wicket. It was Labuschagne\u2019s sixth 50, or more, of the Championship season. Earlier Chris Dent continued his midas run with a hundred, before <strong>Gloucestershire</strong> stumbled after lunch, losing five for 47.</p> <p>Two Division Two games started today. At Wantage Road, <strong>Northamptonshire</strong>\u2019s batsmen threw bits and bobs at a total of 299 on a green pitch. Alex Wakely was top scorer with 65, his first 50 since resigning the captaincy, and Matt Coles swashbuckled to an unbeaten 41 at No 9. Chris Wright took four for 78, hindered by the buttery fingers of the <strong>Leicestershire </strong>fielders who spilled at least seven catches.</p> <p>At a rain-truncated game at Hove, a hundred from Cameron Bancroft kept <strong>Durham </strong>going as they lost four for 26, including a spell of three for 0 in eight balls from Chris Jordan, who perplexed the batsmen with bounce and late swing. Bancroft, who finished 120 not out, eventually found a partner in Ned Eckersley (70 not out), and the pair put on an unbeaten 169 for the sixth wicket.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d1115eb8f080e828514eb73\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T18:32:42.832Z\">7.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thanks all for your company today. </strong>Lots of games seem to be going at six-quarters time and things could be, possibly, decided tomorrow at Chelmsford and The Oval.

An instinctive single may be stolen; sometimes, even a boundary is likely. Without keeping one\u2019s eye on the ball (which one doesn\u2019t on not nicking it because the keeper is expected to collect it cleanly in this case), it wouldn\u2019t be possible to steal these essential runs in the modern era of close games and fine margins.</em></p> <p><em>The solution to this is to never look back and train with the non-striker beforehand to coordinate such moments where they can run if the edge isn\u2019t collected cleanly. Most training camps don\u2019t imbibe such subtle play from the player\u2019s childhood though, and these skills need to be adapted taking more time if the concerned cricketer reaches adulthood. In conclusion, along with shadow batting a forward defence and consciously bowling on the same good length throughout the net sessions, match awareness techniques such as the aforementioned one should be taught as a basic requirement to learn the craft of the game too. The inheritance of these clever skills should ideally take place in one\u2019s childhood to make it their second nature - but then, the perennial question of morality comes in. What lessons are being taught to the children who\u2019ve gone over for casual sport and making acquaintances?

      "bodyText": "At Chelmsford, the Championship leaders Somerset suffered a batting malfunction after being bowled out for 131. Aaron Beard throttled through to his best first-class haul of four for 23, including four wickets in 13 balls, and Jamie Porter took five for 51, on the day that both signed two-year contract extensions with Essex. Beard, 21, only got his chance in the side because of injury to Sam Cook. Essex were 164 for six at the close, Alastair Cook top scorer with 47, the lead a more-than-healthy 249. The match between Surrey and Warwickshire moved along quickly on a gloomy day at The Oval as Warwickshire were dismissed for 230, with three wickets for Sam Curran on his comeback after injury. There were three wickets for Jordan Clark and Morne Morkel too, the trio fiendishly unplayable under floodlights. Mark Stoneman led the Surrey reply with 71; Jeetan Patel chipped in with two wickets. Glamorgan lost three quick late afternoon wickets after Marnus Labuschagne and Nick Selman had put on 95 for the second wicket. It was Labuschagne\u2019s sixth 50, or more, of the Championship season. Earlier Chris Dent continued his midas run with a hundred, before Gloucestershire stumbled after lunch, losing five for 47. Two Division Two games started today. At Wantage Road, Northamptonshire\u2019s batsmen threw bits and bobs at a total of 299 on a green pitch. Alex Wakely was top scorer with 65, his first 50 since resigning the captaincy, and Matt Coles swashbuckled to an unbeaten 41 at No 9. Chris Wright took four for 78, hindered by the buttery fingers of the Leicestershire fielders who spilled at least seven catches. At a rain-truncated game at Hove, a hundred from Cameron Bancroft kept Durham going as they lost four for 26, including a spell of three for 0 in eight balls from Chris Jordan, who perplexed the batsmen with bounce and late swing. Bancroft, who finished 120 not out, eventually found a partner in Ned Eckersley (70 not out), and the pair put on an unbeaten 169 for the sixth wicket. Thanks all for your company today. Lots of games seem to be going at six-quarters time and things could be, possibly, decided tomorrow at Chelmsford and The Oval. Durham are staging a remarkable recovery at the hands of Cameron Bancroft and Ned Eckersley and competitive scores by Northants, Gloucestershire and Glamorgan. More runs for talented young Labuschagne - I wonder if Australian selectors are sniffing about? Have a great evening! And with a cover drive, Selman brings up his fifty at Bristol. A partnership of 60 between him and Labuschagne. Glamorgan 117 for 1, and please excuse me while I write up. Jason Roy won\u2019t be fit to play in England\u2019s World Cup game against Australia at Lord\u2019s tomorrow. James Vince is likely to get another chance to turn flightiness to solidity. Oooh, I wonder. Are we about to have some mystical Gregory magic at midsummer Chelmsford? Lawrence gone for 21. Essex 109 for 3. Just reading up on happenings at Hove. Chris Jordan seems to have bowled a screamingly good spell - three wickets in eight balls without conceding a run. Bounce \u2018n late away swing. Also congratulations to Aaron Thomason for his maiden first-class wicket. Cameron Bancroft bats painstakingly on, 68 not out. Durham 165 for 5. Jeetan Patel back in the wickets, lovely wickets. Rory Burns lbw for 34. Surrey 77 for one, a lead of 41. Charlie Hemphrey falls at Bristol for 28, snaffled by Josh Shaw, swallowed by Gareth Roderick. Glamorgan 68 for one. Big Jamie Overton turns in his boots... Tom Westley caught for 12. He fires up the Somerset turbo-chargers and runs in. Essex 72 for 2. Super catch here by Ackermann at second slip at The County Ground. Does anyone else have a big colourful banner ad for The Hundred at the top of their screen? Sorry about the slight wait between entries - a quick update: Somerset were all out 131 and Essex now 60 for 1 - a lead of 145. Not looking good for the Championship leaders. Alastair Cook still there. Surrey 40 for o in their second innings, a lead over Warwickshire of three. Glamorgan\u2019s batsman charge onwards - 57 for 0. Northants 194 for 5 and Durham wobbling at 128 for 5. It\u2019s tea at Chelmsford, where Essex have a lead over Somerset of 142 runs. Meanwhile, Durham are 117-5 at tea against Sussex, with Cameron Bancroft on 43 not out. Gloucestershire all out 313 - rather a disappointment from 176 for one. Three wickets each for Michael Hogan and Graham Wagg. And Somerset have hit self-destruct - 129 for 9. Maybe this is where Jamie Overton bowls Essex out for 34 in their second innings. World Cup update. Half listening to the commentary from Southampton. England and Australia will reportedly be batting on a very green strip at Lord\u2019s tomorrow. England haven\u2019t beaten Australia in a World Cup match since 1992. And Afghanistan need 263 to beat Bangladesh. Bad light has stopped play at The Oval. Durham have lost a second wicket: 71 for 2. Oh. Peter Siddle is spoiling the comeback. Bartlett gone for 25, Somerset 120 for 8. Jamie Porter grabs a third - Somerset slump to 118 for seven. Can George Bartlett guide them to parity? 98 behind Essex at the moment. And Surendranath Halder is watching the scores tick over at Hove and wondering? \u201cBancroft for the upcoming Ashes: yay or nay?\u201d He\u2019s averaging 24.89 this season to date in CC cricket. The latest extract from Vic\u2019s book: A nice little tale from Clifton Park where last week\u2019s match was was such a success that Yorkshire are hoping to have a festival of limited overs cricket there next year. Scores are level at The Oval, and the partnership of 17 between Gregory and Bartlett is the third biggest of the Somerset innings (91-6) A third wicket for Michael Hogan at Bristol as Gloucestershire slide to 280 for 8. And Durham\u2019s Cameron Bancroft and Gareth Harte have motored along to 50 for 1 at Hove. Talking of Sam Curran ...words and pictures below to prove the same point. Awww, Rob Yates falls two short of his fifty - gone after lunch without adding another run, a second for Sam Curran - back in the Surrey team after the IPL and then injury. Lots of ideas by everyone re Surrey BTL. For what it\u2019s worth when I was at Guildford in early June, there was practically a team\u2019s worth of injuries, which is how players like Jordan Clark and Jamie Smith were getting into the first team. Amar Virdi\u2019s injury problems have been related to the stress reaction in his back that kept him out of the Lions red ball tour to India last winter. And of course Tom Curran doing the drinks carrying for England. And some thoughtful lunchtime reading from Gary Naylor. He waves Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley in front of Ed Smith\u2019s eyes. Division One Chelmsford: Essex 216 (Cook 80; Leach 3-30, JOverton 3-43 ) v Somerset 90-6 (Aaron Beard 4-23) The Oval: Surrey 194 (Lester 4-41) v Warwickshire 176-5 (Rhodes 51, Yates 48 not out) Division Two Bristol: Gloucestershire 266-5 (Dent 105) v Glamorgan Starting today Division Two The County Ground: Northants 72-2 v Leicestershire. Hove: Sussex v Durham 12-1. Rain. Lunch scores to follow. Northants lose a second wicket just before lunch at the County Ground - Vasconcelos for 25. Northants 70 for 2. And for Rob Yates at The Oval, a nearly-there 48 not out as they potter off for soup. And Bangladesh struggling to press the accelerator on a slow sticky wicket at Southampton. It\u2019s raining at Chelmsford, Somerset 90 for 6, and still raining at Hove where Durham only had time to score 12 and lose a wicket. Gary Naylor is at The Oval, where Warwickshire are 173 for four. I\u2019m glad you said that Gary. You\u2019re not alone... Geoff Wignall writes: Regarding Abhijato\u2019s email, in the long ago days if my youth we were always taught that if the ball travels in front of square, it\u2019s the batsman\u2019s call and behind square it\u2019s the non-striker\u2019s. It was simple and straightforward, at least in theory. Is this no longer the case? If so can it really be ascribed to a decline in public or private morality? Should Extinction Rebellion be on the case, instead of blockading commuter trains? Interestingly, I learnt last week that one of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s key principles is no blaming and shaming. Perhaps batsmen and women could adopt this in run-out situations? OMG! as the kids used to say. Aaron Beard! Four for 11! Somerset 78 for 6! Random facts about Aaron Beard: he\u2019s had two back operations, he\u2019s been at Essex since he was nine, he\u2019s only 21, he\u2019s an ex-England U-19 and aged 15 he was a substitute fielder for England during a 2013 Ashes warm-up against Essex. At The Oval Warwickshire only trail by 59, but they\u2019ve lost another wicket - Sam Hain lbw to Jordan Clark for 15. Warwicks 139 for 3. And Chris Dent out for 105 at Bristol, closely followed by Benny Howell for 15. Gloucs 221 for four have lost three for 53 since restarting this morning. Somerset not having the best of mornings - as I write Aaron Beard\u2019s bowling figures read 1.3 -0-5-2 , actually, make that 1.4-0-5-3. Somerset 68 for five -Groenewald, Hildreth and Banton Beard\u2019s trio of wickets. Some wisdom from Abhijato Sensarma on edges and looking and morals and life. \u201cWhen one edges behind, there is a diversion from the original path of the delivery, which wouldn\u2019t have taken place if the bat had not touched the ball in the first place. An instinctive single may be stolen; sometimes, even a boundary is likely. Without keeping one\u2019s eye on the ball (which one doesn\u2019t on not nicking it because the keeper is expected to collect it cleanly in this case), it wouldn\u2019t be possible to steal these essential runs in the modern era of close games and fine margins. The solution to this is to never look back and train with the non-striker beforehand to coordinate such moments where they can run if the edge isn\u2019t collected cleanly. Most training camps don\u2019t imbibe such subtle play from the player\u2019s childhood though, and these skills need to be adapted taking more time if the concerned cricketer reaches adulthood. In conclusion, along with shadow batting a forward defence and consciously bowling on the same good length throughout the net sessions, match awareness techniques such as the aforementioned one should be taught as a basic requirement to learn the craft of the game too. The inheritance of these clever skills should ideally take place in one\u2019s childhood to make it their second nature - but then, the perennial question of morality comes in. What lessons are being taught to the children who\u2019ve gone over for casual sport and making acquaintances? Alas, both sport and morality are contradictory human constructs... and how necessary both are in our lives!\u201d A wicket at The County Ground - Rob Newton for 5, Northants 22 for 1. And Jamie Porter takes his second wicket at Chelmsford - both Somerset openers gone now with 59 on the board. I\u2019ve found this Marcus Trescothick column from the Bristol Live website on June 14. It explains why Tres has been struggling, and his hopes for getting back in the first team. Worth a read. \u201cMy problem this season has been trying to get my brain into gear to bat for a long time. Normally during bad trots I can feel when things are coming back together, but that hasn\u2019t been the case in recent weeks. Whether that is an age thing, I\u2019m not sure. If I knew the answer I could solve it, but at the moment it is just a question of trying to get a score in the second XI and taking things from there.\u201d Puzzled by Joe Root\u2019s choice of chair carrying position. It would be rather hard on the upper arms. Chris Jordan on the money at Hove - Alex Lees gone for a duck. Durham 4 for one. Is it possible for a batsman not to look behind if he\u2019s edged it - as Sibley does below? It is such an obvious giveaway, but the movement seems too instinctive to prevent... Morne Morkle is now going to take 8 for 22 and make me look a right banana. Wicket one - Sibley out for 31, caught by Clarke. Warwicks 99 for 2. An early wicket at Bristol, where James Bracey falls for 28. Gloucs 176 for 2. And play has now started at Hove, where Durham are batting, and are 0-0. There is some rain at Hove which is delaying things a little. But, Surrey! Almost the story of the season so far, though pipped to the post by Somerset. I was so utterly convinced by them last season, I thought they might be Champions for three, four years in a row. Their only possible weakness seemed to be the repeated knock of the England selector, but their achilles heel has turned out be bog-standard injury and old-fashioned loss of form. Any wise thoughts BTL? In other news, Essex seamer Sam Cook will be out of action for up to six weeks after straining his side during last week\u2019s win over Hampshire. And don\u2019t forget to tune into the latest World Cup game: Bangladesh v Afghanistan. Afghanistan have only had a day to recover after their magnificent near miss against India. Can they pull off their first win of the competition today at The Ageas Bowl? Can Bangladesh follow an unlikely path to the semi-finals? Follow all the action here: Division One Chelmsford: Essex 216 (Cook 80; Leach 3-30, JOverton 3-43 ) v Somerset 32-1 The Oval: Surrey 194 (Lester 4-41) v Warwickshire 89-1 (Rhodes 51) Division Two Bristol: Gloucestershire 168-1 (Dent 82 not out) v Glamorgan Starting today Division Two The County Ground: Northants v Leicestershire Hove: Sussex v Durham And a happy Monday to everyone. The Championship programme is slightly confusing this week because of all the World Cup shenanigans. Three matches started yesterday \u2013Essex v Somerset, Surrey v Warwicks and Gloucestershire v Glamorgan - and two start today -Northants v Leicester and Sussex v Durham. Surrey had another shocker at The Oval, bowled out for 194, albeit in seamer-friendly conditions. Toby Lester, on loan from Lancashire because of a Warwickshire injury list that includes Liam Norwell, Ryan Sidebottom, Henry Brookes, Olly Stone and George Panayi, took 4-41. Surrey head coach Michael Di Venuto was not impressed: \u201cIt was a poor day. Apart from the last 11 overs in the field, after the first brief break for bad light and when we took a wicket and started to get some bowling partnerships going, it was one of the worst days in my time here. \u201cThe ball is allowed to swing and seam, and we might well have batted first anyway if there had been a toss. At the moment we have batters getting in but then giving their wickets away, and that is so frustrating to see.\u201d Will Rhodes popped the plump cherry on the cake for Warwickshire by hitting 4, 6, 4, 4 off successive balls of Morne Morkel\u2019s fourth over. Alastair Cook\u2019s 80 dominated Essex\u2019s first innings 216, in which they lost nine wickets for 90. Somerset\u2019s Jack Leach and Jamie Overton took three wickets each. Gloucestershire captain Chris Dent continued his happy run with the bat on a drizzly day at Taunton, 82 not out at the close. Glamorgan used six bowlers in the first hour and a half, there were a few morning accuracy problems.",

      "bodyText": "A woman posed as the aunt of a cyclist who was killed in London in order to oppose plans for a new segregated bike lane, according to the victim\u2019s mother. Eilidh Cairns, a television producer from Alnwick in Northumberland, died aged 30 in 2009 after being hit by a tipper truck while riding in Notting Hill in the borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Her family was contacted by several people who attended a council meeting held this month to discuss a proposed cycle scheme in Kensington, saying a woman who spoke there claimed to be Cairns\u2019s aunt and said: \u201cHad Eilidh been alive today, she would not have supported the scheme.\u201d At the meeting, Kensington and Chelsea council announced it would be opposing the scheme because it had received 450 objections, in effect scotching it before a public consultation closed. Cairns\u2019s mother, Heather Cairns, has written to the council leader asking to be put in touch with the woman who \u201cmasqueraded\u201d as her daughter\u2019s aunt, saying: \u201cSomeone knows who she is.\u201d \u201cMy request to you is that you ask this person to contact me to explain her behaviour and apologise for having the effrontery to claim to know what my dead daughter would think \u2013 no one can make that claim, she is no longer here to blow out the candles on her cake and make a wish,\u201d she wrote to Councillor Elizabeth Campbell. She also asked Campbell to support the cycle lane, citing her own experiences as a former leader of Alnwick district council. \u201cPlease reconsider your decision. You may lose your position as leader of the council, I did when I supported the controversial building of windfarms but I believed in the scheme and would not compromise. They were built,\u201d she wrote. The scheme would introduce new pedestrian crossings and install protected bike routes along some of inner London\u2019s more dangerous roads, including Notting Hill Gate and Shepherd\u2019s Bush. It was being planned by the office of the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, and Transport for London (TfL) but the local authority had an effective veto because it would run on council roads. Kate Cairns, Eilidh Cairns\u2019s sister, an advisor on managing road risk who founded the road safety charity See Me Save Me after her death, said: \u201cIt is disappointing, shocking and irresponsible that [the borough of Kensington and Chelsea] has withdrawn support for a scheme which, had it been in place, would surely have prevented the death of my sister, Eilidh Cairns, who was run down from behind by a fully laden tipper lorry 10 years ago in the middle of Notting Hill Gate whilst cycling to work. \u201cShe was dragged and crushed in front of traumatised schoolchildren, commuters and local shop workers. Is not her death, and a further 275 collisions on this stretch, enough avoidable destruction for the council to take action? Have our elected politicians not learned to take decisions on evidence rather than play political games?\u201d Will Norman, Khan\u2019s commissioner for walking and cycling, said it was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d for the borough to unilaterally veto a scheme on roads on which there had been 275 collisions in the last three years, with the vast majority of serious injuries being to pedestrians and cyclists. Kensington and Chelsea council has said it will submit its own plans for alternative cycle routes to replace Khan\u2019s scheme, which would not involve separated lanes and would send riders along back streets. There is no final timetable as to when the routes might be completed.",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary. He was seen as something of a joke by diplomats \u2013 both UK and foreign \u2013 and is likely to face more questioning over his gaffe about the jailed British-Iranian woman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/nazanin-zaghari-ratcliffe\">Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe</a></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/peterwalker\"><b>Peter Walker</b></a>&nbsp;<i>Political correspondent</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Johnson\u2019s tactic throughout the contest so far has been to keep out of the spotlight, reducing the risk of slip-ups.

Hunt\u2019s attempts to talk up a backstory as an 'underestimated' entrepreneur can fall flat given he is also the son of an admiral and was head boy at Charterhouse. Overall, Hunt\u2019s approach can seem uninspiring and hard to pin down in terms of core beliefs, hence the 'Theresa in trousers' nickname among some Tory MPs.</p>\n    <p>Hunt has made headlines by promising to repeal the ban on fox hunting, while always facing scrutiny on his views on the availability of abortion.</p>\n    <p>His campaign team have decided to take the fight directly to rival Boris Johnson though, with Hunt taking part in a Twitter Q&amp;A session as a direct response to Johnson's refusal to appear on a Sky TV head-to-head debate. The hashtag: #BoJoNoShow.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He says a new deal with the EU is possible by 31 October and he would send a cross-party negotiating team to Brussels, including members of the DUP. He would countenance leaving the EU without a deal but is notably more wary than rival Boris Johnson.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Has been fairly silent on this, beyond a proposal to cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/27/hunts-pledge-to-reduce-corporation-tax-will-cost-13bn-a-year\">according to the IFS</a> would cost an estimated \u00a313bn a year. Even at 19%, the UK rate is well below European and global averages.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Before the campaign began he called for a doubling of defence spending, but he has since pulled back slightly, saying only that it should increase. He has argued that cuts to social care budgets had gone too far.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Hunt backs the 2050 target for zero net carbon emissions and has called for 'sensible tax incentives' to encourage green initiatives, but very little beyond this.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A likely strength for him, as he has been seen as a solid foreign secretary, an impression burnished by taking over from the chaotic Johnson.

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs have been given a fortnight to decide whether they want to stand again for parliament as the party gears up for an early general election by kicking off what some fear could turn into a wave of deselections. Those MPs who want to continue to represent their constituency in future must first navigate the trigger-ballot process. After a contentious rule-change at last year\u2019s Labour conference, that means commanding the support of two-thirds of local party branches and two-thirds of affiliated trade union branches. If an MP fails to do so, an open selection process would be triggered in which they could be challenged by other candidates. Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, wrote to all Labour MPs on Monday, saying they should let the party\u2019s legal department know by 6pm on 8 July \u201cif you wish to remain a candidate at the next general election\u201d. The letter concluded: \u201cMay I also take this opportunity to thank you for the work you have done so far on behalf of the party in parliament.\u201d A Labour spokesman said: \u201cAhead of a possible general election, Labour will begin a reselection process of MPs. We are preparing for a general election, whenever it comes,. The process isn\u2019t new.\u201d Some MPs who have been critical of Jeremy Corbyn fear it could open the way to their removal, though the row over the party\u2019s Brexit stance cuts across many of the usual dividing-lines in the party. News that the process was being started came before what had been intended to be a significant shadow cabinet meeting, but which senior Labour sources now say is unlikely to shift the party\u2019s policy any closer to a full-throated remain stance. In parliament on Monday, Corbyn made clear that Labour would try to force the next prime minister to put their Brexit plans \u201cback to the people\u201d. In response to a statement from Theresa May about last week\u2019s European council meeting,he asked the prime minister: \u201cIn her view, what would be worse: crashing out with no deal in October, or putting this issue back to the people for a final say? \u201cWhoever the next prime minister is, they will barely hold the support of this house, so they certainly have no mandate to force a disastrous hard-right Brexit on this country. Whatever Brexit plan the new Tory leader comes up with, after three long years of failure they should have the confidence to go back to the people on a deal agreed by parliament.\u201d Corbyn told colleagues last week he had been reading the autobiography of the party\u2019s former leader Harold Wilson, who advocated remaining a member of the common market in the 1975 referendum while largely taking a backseat during the campaign and allowing cabinet ministers to support either side. Several shadow cabinet members emerged from last week\u2019s meeting with the clear impression that a decision would be made about Labour\u2019s Brexit stance on Tuesday, after Corbyn had consulted trades union general secretaries. Corbyn\u2019s deputy, Tom Watson, said: \u201cWe had a long discussion last week and we all decided we were going to take a decision at the shadow cabinet. It will be quite a historic day and I hope we can formalise our support for remaining in the EU and supporting the people having the final say on the deal.\u201d However, several members of the shadow cabinet remain concerned about any policy that could be portrayed as seeking to overturn the result of the 2016 referendum and Corbyn is now not expected to make a speech on the issue in the coming days. Tensions at the top of the party exploded into the open after Labour\u2019s disastrous showing in last month\u2019s European elections, with Watson and the shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, pushing openly for a shift in the party\u2019s stance. Even some of Corbyn\u2019s most loyal lieutenants, including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have become increasingly convinced that pledging to back a referendum \u2013 and campaign for remain \u2013 was essential for party morale. Corbyn said Labour would work across the House of Commons to avert a no-deal Brexit.",

      "bodyText": "Closing with the mailbag ... Oh my, the mailbox exploded. A few highlights ... Michael Konopka: \u201cIf VAR has shown anything, it\u2019s a strict adherent to the letter of the law, even if by a millimeter of distance or millinewton of force being applied when kicking an opponent.\u201d Mario S: \u201cHopefully the US will score at least one goal not through a penalty shot otherwise the critics will all claim the US should not have won.\u201d Even then, that call changed the game, and Spain had to chase from there. (Not effectively.) Michael Waechter: \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Jill Ellis sent in Press and Pugh? Our left wing is useless (except for taking (undeserved) penalties).\u201d Jeff McCrum: \u201cSpain is getting away with murder here, the ref has zero respect from them.\u201d Joe Pearson: \u201cCorredera and Rapinoe swapping shirts was a nice touch\u201d Eric Gordon: \u201cCould someone please explain to me why USA and France have ended up in a predictable quarter final showdown .. and not the semis .. were they not both convincing top four favourites from the get go \u2026. So , now either the hostesses or the Legion of doom go out \u2026. Not that as a Canadian I\u2019m really complaining ..\u201d It\u2019s not seeded, and this is an idiosyncrasy of the 24-team field. That said, if you have 32 teams, you may have even more group winners playing in the quarterfinals. Courtney Shin: \u201cWanted to throw in my two cents that despite the controversy of that last penalty call, Rose Lavelle has proven herself a necessary force for her team. She had some peaches of passes, and her and Sam Mewis were clear US standouts for me. All this to say that Spain had an incredible, incredible game. I can only hope the US bring the same level of verve, intensity, and commitment to their next game against France. And maybe a few less fouls.\u201d Twitter is decidedly split on the penalty call. Most worrying for the USA -- no goals from the run of play, and they didn\u2019t even force a difficult save. But neither did Spain -- the goal was really their one good chance. For the neutral, that was awesome. For US fans, that was torture. And the next three games might be the same way. Thanks for following along with me. Check here for the match report shortly. Positives for the USA ... 1. While Rapinoe and Morgan struggled, the latter because of some intense and sometimes illegal defensive attention, Tobin Heath was excellent. 2. On the few times the Spanish attack went down the left flank, Kelley O\u2019Hara promptly stopped it. 3. Rose Lavelle played terrific through balls. 4. After her early mistake, Alyssa Naeher controlled her box very well and distributed with no problems. 5. Abby Dahlkemper, the less experienced half of the center back tandem, made several important clearances. 6. Samantha Mewis was an imposing force in central midfield and played the ball forward quite well, perfectly complementing the reliable Julie Ertz and the playmaker Lavelle. The tactics were bizarre at times. Crystal Dunn is a fantastic player, but when you\u2019re protecting a 2-1 lead and she has been repeatedly beaten, why would you not sub for her? Perhaps because Casey Short, a true left back, wasn\u2019t on the bench? But they survive and advance. And France look anything but immortal. Let\u2019s finish up on the controversy, then get to the positives for the USA ... There was contact. There was not enough to make someone fall down. The word \u201ctrifling\u201d is part of the referees\u2019 vocabulary. Final comment: All that said, it was a poor game all the way around for the VAR crew. They could have reviewed a few more incidents in each box, and if Spain hadn\u2019t delayed the penalty, that call might not have been reviewed at all. Now on to the positives ... It was more controversial than convincing, but let\u2019s count the reasons the USA deserve this result ... 1. More possession. 2. A defense that took the edge off most of Spain\u2019s chances after that early goal. 3. As soft as the second penalty call was, some other Spanish fouls went uncalled. So now a quarterfinal between two favorites, the USA and France, who looked far from dominant in the round of 16. 90+8 min: Spain try to switch fields, but the impatient Caldentey takes it at midfield. Finally a long ball into the box ... Paredes is down seeking a call. We\u2019ve seen no indication of a VAR intrusion, not even after the ball is out of play. 90+7 min: Rapinoe, with her last kick, puts the ball out of play. Press comes in to replace her, and Rapinoe exits on the far sideline in accordance with the new Laws of the Game. 90+6 min: Ertz has dropped from defensive mid to the center of defense. Rapinoe is fouled by Corredera and takes some time to adjust her socks. No question about the foul. Christen Press is warming up. Naeher clears the ball long. 90+5 min: You\u2019d think Ellis would slow things down and use her third sub. Not at the moment, while the USA keep possession down the left flank for a good long time. 90+4 min: Dahlkemper with another vital interception. Replay shows Paredes wasn\u2019t fouled on the prior play. NOW the US defense are passing the test. 90+3 min: Long ball to Paredes, who has run up from center back into the box. She tumbles. Ref isn\u2019t interested. 90+2 min: O\u2019Hara slides cleanly to stop a counterattack. Dahlkemper heads a cross clear. Spain really haven\u2019t had a promising attack in some time. 90+1 min: Heath falls on the right side. Spanish player motions for her to get up. Replay shows ... maybe impeding? 90 min: Lloyd gets the ball and is rather ridiculous taken out. That\u2019ll only hurt Spain. A replay shows an arm around Rapinoe\u2019s neck on a previous play. We\u2019re getting seven minutes of stoppage time, much of it surely for the VAR review. 89 min: Sandra Pa\u00f1os holds the ball despite a collision. No foul, which is probably the right (no-)call. 88 min: Heath earns a corner, and Horan replaces Lavelle. THAT is a sensible substitution, as long as Horan doesn\u2019t pick up a yellow. Should be more. 87 min: Lloyd\u2019s first contribution to this game is an offside call. Replay shows the call probably wasn\u2019t right. Lloyd is one of the two or three best clutch scorers the USA have ever had. This is not the situation for that. 85 min: Dunn and Rapinoe win the ball from three Spanish players, one of whom falls. Paredes responds by wiping out Rapinoe and getting a yellow. And now Lloyd comes in for Morgan, which makes no sense whatsover. A speedy counterattacker, OK. That\u2019s not Lloyd. 82 min: Correction -- the third Spanish sub is coming in now, with Caldenty replacing the goal-scorer Hermoso. Or not. Torrecilla is down, and she\u2019s the one who\u2019ll come out. The previous sub was Falcon for Putellas. Meanwhile, while straining to protect a 2-1 lead, the USA turn to ... Carli Lloyd. I don\u2019t want to live on this planet any more. 80 min: We still have a good game in progress. Rapinoe goes close from a tough angle. Naeher punches clear in a tough collision. Morgan clears the ensuing corner. Spain have made three subs now. The USA have made none. If ever there was a time to bring in another defender. Roger Wallace: \u201cAs a US fan I hope they overturn this penalty. I think there have been a ton of fouls that should have been called on Spain, but this would just leave a bad taste in the mouth for everyone. So soft\u201d Henry Flory: \u201cEnjoying the commentary, but \u201canti-homer\u201d sounds right, if you\u2019re going to call it a dive at least wait for one replay showing an absence of cleat-to-shin contact?\u201d I\u2019ve seen the replay. Lavelle went flying. Roger Theberge says there was contact but it was soft. Tom Wahl: \u201cYou\u2019re doing your job right when a homer accuses you of being anti-homer. Keep up the fair and open minded critique. Don\u2019t fall into the trap of these fans who think the women\u2019s team can do no wrong.\u201d Thanks. I look forward to being burned in effigy on Twitter later this afternoon. The view from Canada: The penalty is given after review. The ref tells Rapinoe to move the ball back onto the spot. Nearly saved but not quite. She went the same way as her first. Keeper guessed correctly, but it\u2019s a low hard shot. This game is now officially controversial. Twitter is divided ... Christina Unkel (Fox rules expert) says there was contact. Aly Wagner says Lavelle\u2019s leg didn\u2019t move. Spain does everything they can to delay the penalty, and with good reason. The VAR crew takes a full two minutes to awaken from their slumber and alert the referee. It\u2019s a great game, folks. Wake up. 70 min: When will we see a sub? I like the term \u201canti-homer,\u201d by the way. Graavarg says the USA lead the world in unsportsmanlike conduct. And right on cue, Lavelle dives for a penalty. If this stands, that\u2019s a robbery. Comments: Henry Flory: \u201cIf I were to sub in an American attacker, I\u2019d tell whomever is coming on to give something back to the Spanish CBs, who have been pretty damn rough, especially #4. Since the very opening, when Morgan was knocked down twice off the ball, it\u2019s been non-stop. I suppose, if you\u2019re someone who believes Barca\u2019s dominance is built on a foundation of cynical fouls and dramatic falls, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised...\u201d I think the USA have taken some dramatic fall. Joe Pearson: \u201cStop being such an anti-homer. Morgan is being fouled whenever she even gets near the ball. Spain is playing very cynically and daring the ref to make the calls. She is bottling it.\u201d Feedback noted. Mario S: \u201cI have a bad feeling that the US is going to start pressing too hard. They are missing shots they should be making and Spain is going to get a breakaway with US defenders up in the wrong box.\u201d Quite possible. Paul G. Frazer: \u201cjust have to say, if alex morgan is really struggling, shouldn\u2019t she be subbed?? I am a bit worried about this one,\u201d You\u2019re not alone. On Rapinoe: Brilliant career, but she\u2019s flailing here. Naeher collects a cross and boots it to the other box. Heath was within 20 yards, but that wasn\u2019t dangerous. 65 min: The international broadcast shows Hope Solo again after that play. Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but Solo didn\u2019t play left back. And now Mewis goes somewhat close with a long-range shot. I need a hydration break. 63 min: CHANCE FOR SPAIN! Dunn is beaten again, and Guijarro gets a cross/shot past Ertz and Naeher that barely slides past the far post. Mailbag ... Roger Theberge wants the US to shoot while the sun is in the Spanish keeper\u2019s eyes. Not a bad idea, and they\u2019ve done so twice in the last few minutes. 61 min: Garcia slides past Dahlkemper down the left and cuts the ball back to the top of the box. The only person there is Ertz, who is not on Garcia\u2019s team. Isn\u2019t it supposed to be hot? This is end-to-end and frenetic. I\u2019m trying to get to the mailbag, but this game is too fast! 60 min: CHANCE FOR USA! Rose Lavelle\u2019s 22-yarder just goes over the bar. 59 min: More passes in the US half than we\u2019re used to seeing, and Mewis ends up charging forward with the ball. Spain win it, and Ertz slips on a challenge and wins a foul. Please show more replays of these. Fair enough. If I may backtrack a little -- Rapinoe is one of those players who can destroy a team in an instant. But if that doesn\u2019t happen soon, will Ellis go to the bench. Probably not. 56 min: Now THAT\u2019S a foul. Paredes slides through O\u2019Hara on the edge of the box. And the ref ignores it. 55 min: CHANCE FOR USA! They played the ball to Heath! Lavelle sends it to her, and Heath shoots from a tough angle just over the bar. 54 min: Naeher is up to the challenge with a strong punch in traffic. And Morgan falls again. If these are legitimate fouls, we\u2019re long overdue for persistent infringement. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a foul. Morgan swings an arm first. 53 min: Free kick to the USA as Morgan tumbles again, this time a bit too easily for my taste. Look, if you\u2019re going to say Corredera fell too easily on the Rapinoe slap, well ... The USA lose possession and concede a corner. 50 min: The ref apparently missed a couple of off-the-ball fouls, including one in the box. Heath is hurt for a moment as she and Virginia Torrecilla slide into a challenge simultaneously. Now Morgan is down, and Jill Ellis really should take her out. 48 min: Rapinoe and Corredera renew their 1v1 battle. This round to Corredera. Apparently, the USA weren\u2019t listening to me when I reminded them that there\u2019s a right flank on the field, and Tobin Heath is there. 47 min: I\u2019m going to be chuckling for a while at all the Fox commentators and analysts in a state of disbelief over the current state of this game. Fox already had to broadcast a men\u2019s World Cup with no US team. Imagine if this game goes awry. 46 min: No subs mentioned. The USA get a free kick from ... call it 35 yards. Or 30 meters. Heath takes it, which is not her strong suit, and Paredes clears with ease. Agreed. Disagreed on Lloyd, who\u2019s basically a goal-poacher at this stage of her career. She\u2019s not going to break down the defense in the middle of the field. If I end up eating those words, fine. I didn\u2019t have much for lunch. Armchair US tactician says ... 1. Get the ball to Heath early. She\u2019ll create the goal to break the Spanish resistance. 2. Consider bringing in Tierna Davidson at left back and moving Crystal Dunn up the field, replacing either Rose Lavelle in the midfield or (ducks from Twitterati who think that if Megan Rapinoe says the sky is green, then it\u2019s green) Megan Rapinoe up front. 3. It\u2019s not happening for Alex Morgan today. Pick any forward to come in. Best players of the half: USA: Mewis has more than justified her inclusion here, bossing the midfield and playing sharp balls forward. Heath has been brilliant every time she\u2019s seen the ball -- maybe Jill Ellis should be telling the team to get the ball to her more often instead of assuming Rapinoe will always do something brilliant on the left. Spain: Brilliant finish from Hermoso, but Garcia has been the persistent danger. Paredes also deserves credit for bottling up the center of the defense. Mailbag! Paul Thompson (the guitarist?): \u201cThat was incredibly lazy on the US part, and an evidence of incredibly poor preparation. If a defender cannot handle the pressure in this situation, the preparation for the match was extremely lax.\u201d It was an appalling decision from Naeher to play that ball. Roger Wallace: \u201cI know it\u2019s probably near sacrilege to say this, but despite the penalty Rapinoe has been just about the worst player on the pitch so far this game to my eye. Undisciplined several times, losing the ball or wasting excellent balls from Lavelle or others many times, horrible shot. If I were the U.S. I\u2019d get Press or Pugh in there at the first opportunity.\u201d Hmmm. I don\u2019t think I can agree with that, but it\u2019s funny that the ball was rarely on the far side of the field. Tobin Heath has seen little of the ball aside from winning the penalty, and Kelley O\u2019Hara has had naught to do because Spain simply haven\u2019t attacked down that flank. Joe Pearson: \u201cNever in my life have I been slapped so hard that I fell down. Seems to happen to footballers all the time.\u201d That\u2019s just because the refs can\u2019t see everything. Gotta draw attention somehow! The score is no fluke. The USA have had more possession, but Spain have asked many questions of the US defense, and they don\u2019t have good answers. Off to the restroom and the fridge, and I\u2019ll be right back to argue with all of you from Twitter and the mailbag. (No, no -- I appreciate all of you.) 45+2 min: Morgan is fouled 25 yards out. Irene Paredes disagrees. Rapinoe and Morgan lobby for a yellow, more likely for persistent infringement than that foul alone. Refs never give persistent infringement, and they should. The US play the free kick to perfection, with several players racing unimpeded toward the goal, but Rapinoe\u2019s delivery is poorly weighted. 45 min: Better from Dunn, who takes the ball to the outside under pressure and wins a foul. We\u2019ll have three minutes of stoppage time, which will surely irk Spanish supporters. 44 min: Rapinoe\u2019s corner is dangerous, but Sandra Pa\u00f1os punches it well, and the USA can\u2019t control. Goal kick. The foul call was certainly just -- yes, Twitter, it was. The yellow might have been harsh. I miss Sam\u2019s Army. Meanwhile, Corredera is beaten in the corner by Mewis, whose cross is blocked out for a corner. Virginia Torrecilla took the brunt of it and is down. 40 min: Spain have the ball down the right, and the cross bounces in front of Naeher and, fortunately for US fans, bounds over the head of Alexia Putellas. Did we warn you that this might be a tough game? Didn\u2019t we? 38 min: Spain show intent, and Lucia Garcia has been a handful. Dahlkemper has to block a shot in the box, and Naeher alertly grabs a ball over the top to the onrushing forward-ish player. The crowd may not like it, but even Megan Rapinoe isn\u2019t allowed to slap a defender in the face, which is what she did to Marta Corredera. Rapinoe sportingly smiles and offers what appears to be an apology. 36 min: Rapinoe and Mewis take turns taking inconsequential worm-burners from 25 yards that go well wide. There -- here\u2019s your Hermoso goal ... Mailbag: Stephen Holliday rightly takes me to task for focusing on the US error rather than Hermoso\u2019s brilliant lob. Also, Kyle Brown writes: \u201cA Guardian commentary a few days back mentioned the US playing the rare 0-0-10. Are they at that again today?\u201d No, Kyle, you are wrong. It\u2019s a 1-0-9, with Sauerbrunn back. 30 min: Rapinoe hits the ground on what appeared to be no contact whatsoever. Play on, says our ref. Garcia gets the ball with roughly 40 yards of space in any direction. Her cross is collected by Naeher under a strong challenge. Alex Morgan is down at midfield, and Spain are making a sub. It\u2019s the luckless Losada, who was banged up earlier on a play we haven\u2019t seen again. She\u2019s in tears as Nahikari Garc\u00eda comes in. 28 min: And again, the US defense have a nervy moment. The ball is played over the top to Garcia, who races past the US defense. Naeher has to collect it on her chest just outside the box. Oh dear. Spain again send it through down the right, but the excellent Sauerbrunn interposes her body and wins it back to Naeher, who actually has time to play it this time. 27 min: More shakiness on the US backline, as Dunn plays a hospital ball back to Naeher near the side of the box. Her initial clearance clangs into an onrushing attacker, but they clean up. 25 min: Dunn commits a foul, and it\u2019s a free kick to the USA. OK, then. It\u2019s cleverly taken to Mewis, who\u2019s sprinting out of the center toward the left. Kelley O\u2019Hara (right back) passes in the box to Julie Ertz (defensive midfield) who shoots over the bar. Where, exactly, are the forwards supposed to go if the defense is 15 yards from the Spanish goal? Art Levy writes: \u201cProud team USA supporter here, but it doesn\u2019t feel right that Losada looks like she\u2019s going to need Mickey to cut her, and we haven\u2019t seen a view of Apollo Mewis\u2019 clocking her.\u201d It\u2019s OK -- the domestic commentary team assures us it was an accident. We believe them, right? Meanwhile, a stat on the screen says the USA lead in passes, 95-37. 23 min: Now Spain have the ball ... oh, wait, no they don\u2019t, and Lavelle runs straight down the middle. Ball is played out. If it makes you feel better, it\u2019s past 6 pm in Spain. It\u2019s stunning how often this happens at major events. Except in Beijing. 19 min: Rapinoe wins the ball, Mewis plays to the eagerly overlapping Dunn, whose dangerous cross goes through to Spain\u2019s relief. It\u2019s safe to say Spain have not established their possession-based game here. 17 min: Quick free kick, another slippery run from Heath, and Rapinoe and Morgan each get a half-chance. 16 min: Morgan isn\u2019t seeing much of the ball in the center, but Rapinoe is giving experienced right-back Marta Corredera all sorts of fits. Abby Dahlkemper shoots/plays the ball from Carli Lloyd 2015 range, but Sandra Pa\u00f1os easily catches in mild traffic. 13 min: CHANCE FOR USA! Take THAT, Rose Lavelle haters. A gorgeous through ball gives Rapinoe a close-range shot. It\u2019s saved but might have been going wide anyway -- the purple-haired veteran should\u2019ve done better. Looks pretty full at the moment. Jill Ellis and company are looking at a tablet on the sideline while trainers tend to Vicky Losada, who got the worst of a collision with Mewis. And the US defense flunks its first real test. Naeher plays the ball to Sauerbrunn, who\u2019s already under pressure from Garcia. The ball gets to Spain\u2019s forward Hermoso, who chips it over the out-of-position Naeher. Before you start -- Hope Solo has done that in a major tournament, too. No controversy about any of that. Heath was just too much for Mapi Le\u00f3n, the first player to earn a transfer fee in Spanish women\u2019s soccer. She\u2019s also interested in going into the tattoo business after her playing career. Well, she left a mark on Heath\u2019s leg, but that\u2019s probably not what she meant. Short runup, blistering shot, keeper guesses wrong anyway. 5 min: PENALTY TO USA! Ball played directly from defender Dahlkemper to the ever-dangerous Heath, who cuts the ball back. Mapi Leon left her leg in, tripping Heath, and Rapinoe goes to the spot. Mario S. is annoyed that Fox has not seen fit to interrupt its daytime programming for this game: \u201cI just love that here in the USA our only access to watching US Women play is via pay TV (Fox premium). That\u2019s a great way to build consensus support in the USA. Bah! Humbug!\u201d Technically, Fox Sports 1 is usually available on a sports tier on most cable systems, and it\u2019s part of most streaming services. But the point is well made. 3 min: An early sign of the USA\u2019s aggressive approach -- they win a throw-in deep in Spain\u2019s half. Rapinoe throws it in to Crystal Dunn, who\u2019s theoretically the left back. 1 min: CHANCE FOR SPAIN! Ball played down the left, crossed, not quite cleared, and Guijarro\u2019s shot nails Becky Sauerbrunn in the face. 1 min: And we have a foul call? No, the ball hit the ref. That\u2019s now a dropped ball. Reminder of the lineups ... Spain: Pa\u00f1os, Corredera, Paredes, Le\u00f3n, Ouahabi, Losada, Torrecilla, Guijarro, Lucia Garcia, Hermoso, Putellas USA: Naeher, O\u2019Hara, Dahlkemper, Sauerbrunn, Dunn, Lavelle, Ertz, Mewis, Heath, Morgan, Rapinoe Referee: Katalin Kulcsar (Hungary) . The ARs are from Hungary and Croatia. The VAR crew is from the Netherlands, Poland and the Czech Republic. By the way, it\u2019s hot. Here we go. Spain\u2019s weakness -- possession without goals As you might expect from a side drawing heavily from Barcelona\u2019s Champions League-contending squad, Spain can possess the ball. The problem is converting all that possession to goals. Spain kicked off Euro 2017 with a 2-0 win over Iberian neighbor Portugal. In their next two group games and a quarterfinal matchup with Austria, Spain had at least 70% of the possession -- including 78% against England -- according to Vavel. In this tournament, Spain opened with a 3-1 win over South Africa. Then 59% of the possession against Germany, to whom they lost 1-0. The offensive stats against China were staggering -- 61% possession, 24 shots to China\u2019s 1, nine shots on goal to China\u2019s 0, eight corner kicks to China\u2019s 0. Final score: 0-0. The draw clinched their spot in the knockout rounds, but still ... Spain\u2019s US ties ... In addition to Losada and Boquete, another Spanish player has had an impact in the USA. Backup defender Celia Jim\u00e9nez played at Iowa Western Community College, then drew plenty of interest from top-level programs. She chose Alabama. Why? Aerospace engineering. The player who\u2019s NOT here Maybe it\u2019s not quite as notable an absence as Ada Hegerberg for Norway, but Spain are playing in this tournament without a legend -- Vero Boquete, so revered in her home country that she has a stadium named after her. Her club career can best be described as \u201cperipatetic.\u201d She has passed through the USA a couple of times, establishing herself in WPS while that league existed, returning for a stint with Portland and now playing for the Utah Royals. But coach Jorge Vilda dumped her from the national team for Euro 2017, and she\u2019s not here this time around. Eleonora Giovio, writing in our team guide: Vilda is always keen to stress the importance of the collective rather than any individual stars and he has not called up Boquete for that reason. Boquete led a player revolt that led to the dismissal of longtime coach Ignacio Querada, which was noted in passing when El Pais reported her absence from the Euro squad. Spain\u2019s stars Supporters might be a little happy to see Vicky Losada in the lineup: Losada started against South Africa but was pulled at halftime. She\u2019s familiar to US fans for her stint with the Western New York Flash. She\u2019s also one of five players who made the 55-player shortlist when FIFPro compiled a World XI list for 2017. The others: Goalkeeper Sandra Pa\u00f1os, who has played the whole way for Spain so far in France Center back Irene Paredes, also ever-present Midfielder Silvia Meseguer, who has played little in this Cup Forward Jennifer Hermoso, by far the leading scorer on this team heading into the Cup and the penalty-taker for Spain here The only US players on that list were Alex Morgan and Carli Lloyd. We\u2019ll leave it to others to say whether the omissions of Rapinoe, Heath, Sauerbrunn et al undermine the credibility of said list. The news here is that Vicky Losada, one of Spain\u2019s star players, starts after playing limited minutes in the group stage. Next, we\u2019ll explain why Spain can beat the USA. Lindsey Horan, a sturdy presence in the U.S. midfield, is not starting. Defensive midfielder Julie Ertz is too vital to omit, but supporters may be surprised to see Samantha Mewis and Rose Lavelle. The reaction is mixed. Goff goes on to point out that Horan has a yellow already, and they don\u2019t want to go without her when they face France. Oops ... if they face France. Can\u2019t take this one for granted. Which explains this reaction ... And this one ... Probably because the only way to do that would be to bench either Megan Rapinoe or Tobin Heath. Or perhaps to shift one of them back to midfield, and then you\u2019re asking Mewis or Lavelle to carry the load at attacking mid, anyway. Untested yet dominant, the USA have stormed into the knockout rounds with a +18 goal difference, no goals conceded and a lot of questions about the defense. None of that makes sense, does it? It\u2019s not the US women\u2019s fault. You can only play who\u2019s in front of you, and in the group stage, the teams in front of them were two overmatched side and a surprisingly toothless Swedish side. Now they face Spain, a side which absolutely has the capacity to cause an upset here. Will we see another nail-biter as we saw with France yesterday? Or another dull rout? Let\u2019s find out. Beau will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s what we can expect today: Alyssa Naeher isn\u2019t exactly one to talk about herself. That\u2019s why a reporter thought Carli Lloyd could fill in the gaps: what should the world know about USA\u2019s starting goalkeeper? \u201cI think Alyssa Naeher doesn\u2019t want anybody to know about Alyssa Naeher,\u201d Lloyd said, laughing. Naeher is USA\u2019s first World Cup starter in goal not named Hope Solo or Briana Scurry in two decades and, although casual fans may be unfamiliar with the spotlight-shy goalkeeper now, she will eventually step out of the shadows of Solo and Scurry. Either because she will finally concede a goal in this tournament, or because she will save USA\u2019s hide. Neither has happened yet, but with the US facing Spain in the last 16 on Monday, both those scenarios are coming into view. Although Sweden were supposed to be the first \u201creal\u201d test of the US back line, the Swedes were already through to the knockout round and content to rest top players when the two teams met last Thursday. Spain, meanwhile, will be playing for their World Cup lives. You can read the full article below:",

For Vetements to use it in such a flippant and provocative manner; I don\u2019t think they realise what these words mean to us Arabs.\u201d Some have pointed out that the Qasimi T-shirts, which are sold for \u00a3115, also in their way capitalise on the phrase. But others have defended the designer, saying his intentions were very different. In an interview with Wonderland a few years ago, he said: \u201cI feel it\u2019s important to discuss political issues, especially when coming from the Middle East. I use fashion as a medium to have a discourse and exchange points of view. I always reference the Middle East alongside other inspirations, be it politics, architecture or contemporary art.\u201d For all of her criticism of the Vetements T-shirt, Seraqui de Buttafoco thinks it is good that people, \u201cwill know the story of what happened in Beirut and perhaps it will give them the idea to go and buy books and understand.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s largest medicinal cannabis company has urged the government to allow GPs to prescribe the drug, calling on the UK to be a \u201cleader not a laggard\u201d in one of the world\u2019s fastest growing major industries. Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Canada-based Aurora Cannabis, said the UK was failing patients who might benefit from medicinal cannabis, as well as forfeiting economic gain, due to the restrictions of the existing regulatory regime. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, authorised the use of medicinal products derived from cannabis last year following a long-running campaign fronted by the parents of children suffering severe epilepsy, who reported that cannabis oil helped with their condition. But it can only be prescribed by specialist physicians and cannot be imported until a prescription has been issued. These rules, coupled with division among doctors about how effective it is, means fewer than 100 patients are thought to have been prescribed it. \u201cWhat was the point of creating a medical cannabis system if patients can\u2019t access it?\u201d Battley said, speaking at the annual Cannabis Europa conference in London, attended by leading firms in the nascent but already multibillion dollar industry. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the UK to take this system that is not working and make it work,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that general practitioners can prescribe. There\u2019s no need for requiring a specialist consultant to write a prescription. I\u2019d like to see the UK be a leader, not a laggard.\u201d David Henn, chief executive of Germany-based Cannamedical, backed Battley, saying the law \u201cdoes not make great sense for patients\u201d and also forced up costs. He said restrictions on imports caused by the UK\u2019s regulatory regime meant that Cannamedical could profitably sell medicinal cannabis to pharmacies in Germany at \u20ac10 a gram but would have to ask for \u00a330 a gram to achieve the same margin in the UK. \u201cWe need to be able to hold stock, bring in larger amounts so that as soon as there is a prescription you can distribute to pharmacies,\u201d he said. He added that a no-deal Brexit could make it near-impossible for UK patients to obtain medicinal cannabis, unless the UK aligns itself with EU rules on good manufacturing practice. Campaigners and companies that produce cannabis say patients have reported that it can help with pain, epilepsy and nausea, including sickness caused by chemotherapy. Battley told the Guardian that the company was \u201cmaking progress\u201d in discussions with the government about loosening regulation, adding that it was only in the last year that politicians had been willing to speak to the company. He pointed to Aurora\u2019s domestic market of Canada, where he said the number of patients had gone from a handful to 400,000 in just a few years, with 20,000 physicians having prescribed cannabis since its medical use was legalised in 2001. Recreational marijuana is also legal in Canada, which has become the de facto centre of the global industry, hosting giants such as Aurora, which produces 160,000kg of dried flower a year and has a stock market value of more than \u00a35.5bn. Canopy Growth, a rival which trades under the stock market ticker WEED and has a partnership with rapper Snoop Dogg, is the largest company by stock market value, at \u00a310.6bn. Battley also warned that the UK was missing out on developing its own cannabis industry due to the restrictive regulatory environment. \u201cIt\u2019s not that often that a new industry is invented in real time. The UK should grab hold of that and the jobs that will ensue. \u201cOtherwise there will be questions asked and fingers pointed about who missed the opportunity.

This has been one of his most impressive traits as England manager, and I think we can assume, based on everything we have seen from him so far, that he was as honest with his players when they got back to the team hotel. They need to examine every mistake they made against Cameroon, so they\u2019re ready to show their best against a flourishing Norway team. If England allow Guro Reiten or Isabell Herlovsen on the left-hand side for Norway the kind of space they got against Australia, they will cause a lot of trouble. If they allow or Caroline Hansen the space on the counterattack to run at the back line, they will struggle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/cameroon-england-women-world-cup-2019-context-meltdown\">The Cameroonian meltdown was unimpressive, but context is important | Njie Enow</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I have praised the midfielders Keira Walsh and Jill Scott previously in this tournament. Scott in particular has been in excellent form, and against Cameroon broke Peter Shilton\u2019s record for the most appearances for England in World Cup finals. But in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-1-2-3 formation Walsh is meant to be a defensive midfielder, who sits in and protects the backline, while Scott is a box-to-box player, tucking in defensively and getting forward to break into the opposition penalty area.</p> \n<p>Against Cameroon both players were too high and left a lot of space in behind them in midfield. One pass and their line was beaten, and it happened a number of times. That is dangerous, because once you beat the midfield line the defence is completely exposed. Against pace, which Norway have got in abundance, this is asking for trouble. A pass to either flank or a through-ball to Herlovsen, and they\u2019re in on goal. The move that led to Nchout scoring, though the goal was disallowed by VAR after the tightest of offside calls, showed how England allowed themselves to be carved open against a Cameroon side that lacked quality in the final third.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"v\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lucy Bronze was guilty of overdribbling, carrying the ball into midfield where she was out of position and losing it would cause immediate danger. She is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world, but there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and sometimes she finds herself on the wrong side of it. Her assist for Ellen White\u2019s goal showed her using her abilities perfectly, exposing the opposition defence before playing a great pass, but sometimes she can be guilty of playing her team into danger, leaving space to exploit on the turnover.</p> \n<p>White has now scored four goals in France, and is in wonderful form. But Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisd\u00f3ttir at the heart of the Norwegian defence were exceptional against Australia and controlled the best forward in the world in Sam Kerr. If England are going to get past that pair White\u2019s movement has to be exceptional, and Fran Kirby will have to help her out with runs from the No 10 role. England will need more than one player to be affecting those two, because the Chelsea pair are smart, experienced defenders who will be familiar with the English forwards.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/england-cameroon-bullied-concerns-phil-neville-norway\">England\u2019s refusal to be bullied by Cameroon cannot hide concerns</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At the same time England\u2019s back four needs to be at the top of their game to deal with Herlovsen, who is in clinical form, Hansen, who must have put in one of the best performances of her life against Australia, and Reiten, a tricky left winger who is about to join Mjelde and Thorisd\u00f3ttir at Chelsea. When they played Japan in the group stage England were much more tactically disciplined than they were against Cameroon. Japan played a lot of pretty football but didn\u2019t really get anywhere, because England made themselves hard to break down. That is the kind of organisation they will need to show on Thursday.</p> \n<p>It can be hard, in the middle of a tournament, to turn a poor performance in one game into an excellent one in the next. That is the challenge England face now. The only way to achieve it is to be honest with yourself, to review your mistakes and make sure you don\u2019t repeat them. That is the process Phil Neville and his team have to put themselves through if they are to earn a place in the semi-finals.</p>",

This has been one of his most impressive traits as England manager, and I think we can assume, based on everything we have seen from him so far, that he was as honest with his players when they got back to the team hotel. They need to examine every mistake they made against Cameroon, so they\u2019re ready to show their best against a flourishing Norway team. If England allow Guro Reiten or Isabell Herlovsen on the left-hand side for Norway the kind of space they got against Australia, they will cause a lot of trouble. If they allow or Caroline Hansen the space on the counterattack to run at the back line, they will struggle. I have praised the midfielders Keira Walsh and Jill Scott previously in this tournament. Scott in particular has been in excellent form, and against Cameroon broke Peter Shilton\u2019s record for the most appearances for England in World Cup finals. But in a 4-2-3-1 or 4-1-2-3 formation Walsh is meant to be a defensive midfielder, who sits in and protects the backline, while Scott is a box-to-box player, tucking in defensively and getting forward to break into the opposition penalty area. Against Cameroon both players were too high and left a lot of space in behind them in midfield. One pass and their line was beaten, and it happened a number of times. That is dangerous, because once you beat the midfield line the defence is completely exposed. Against pace, which Norway have got in abundance, this is asking for trouble. A pass to either flank or a through-ball to Herlovsen, and they\u2019re in on goal. The move that led to Nchout scoring, though the goal was disallowed by VAR after the tightest of offside calls, showed how England allowed themselves to be carved open against a Cameroon side that lacked quality in the final third. Lucy Bronze was guilty of overdribbling, carrying the ball into midfield where she was out of position and losing it would cause immediate danger. She is undoubtedly one of the best players in the world, but there is a fine line between confidence and arrogance and sometimes she finds herself on the wrong side of it. Her assist for Ellen White\u2019s goal showed her using her abilities perfectly, exposing the opposition defence before playing a great pass, but sometimes she can be guilty of playing her team into danger, leaving space to exploit on the turnover. White has now scored four goals in France, and is in wonderful form. But Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisd\u00f3ttir at the heart of the Norwegian defence were exceptional against Australia and controlled the best forward in the world in Sam Kerr. If England are going to get past that pair White\u2019s movement has to be exceptional, and Fran Kirby will have to help her out with runs from the No 10 role. England will need more than one player to be affecting those two, because the Chelsea pair are smart, experienced defenders who will be familiar with the English forwards. At the same time England\u2019s back four needs to be at the top of their game to deal with Herlovsen, who is in clinical form, Hansen, who must have put in one of the best performances of her life against Australia, and Reiten, a tricky left winger who is about to join Mjelde and Thorisd\u00f3ttir at Chelsea. When they played Japan in the group stage England were much more tactically disciplined than they were against Cameroon. Japan played a lot of pretty football but didn\u2019t really get anywhere, because England made themselves hard to break down. That is the kind of organisation they will need to show on Thursday. It can be hard, in the middle of a tournament, to turn a poor performance in one game into an excellent one in the next. That is the challenge England face now. The only way to achieve it is to be honest with yourself, to review your mistakes and make sure you don\u2019t repeat them. That is the process Phil Neville and his team have to put themselves through if they are to earn a place in the semi-finals.",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s tax plan to tackle \u201cbracket creep\u201d will only give more compensation to income earners who need it the least, a new analysis of Australia\u2019s tax system has found. The progressive thinktank the Australia Institute reviewed the past 18 years of tax policy and found wage earners at all levels had been overcompensated for so-called bracket creep, with income tax cut by larger amounts than the tax increased due to moving up a bracket. Including the government\u2019s planned flat tax of 30% for people earning between $45,000 and $200,000, the Australia Institute estimates someone earning $60,000 would be $1,919 a year better off compared with if tax thresholds had just been increased to account for inflation. But someone on $125,000 would be $7,035 a year better off and someone on $200,000 was $19,785 better off in the same circumstances. The thinktank\u2019s senior economist Matt Grudnoff said that meant someone on $60,000 a year had been overcompensated by 5% of the total amount of income tax they had paid, while someone on $200,000 had benefited by 27%. \u201cThe government\u2019s income tax plan gives most of the tax cut benefit to the highest tax brackets,\u201d Grudnoff said. \u201cThese high-income individuals are already the most overcompensated. Given that bracket creep is regressive, these top tax brackets require the least compensation, not the most. Claims by the government that their top-end tax cuts are designed to reduce the impacts of bracket creep are simply not supported by the data.\u201d The fresh analysis comes as Labor indicates it will stand firm against the Coalition\u2019s full $158bn tax cut package, saying the third stage to reduce the tax rate for those earning between $45,000 and $200,000 is unaffordable. Bracket creep is when inflation alone pushes your wage into a higher tax bracket. Inflation is now at record lows, reducing the impact of bracket creep. Stage three of the Morrison government\u2019s $158bn tax plan, which is estimated to cost $95bn on its own, is aimed at tackling what the prime minister and his senior ministers have described as the scourge of the tax system. \u201cCutting the income tax rate from 32.5c to 30c the dollar for people earning between $45,000 up to $200,000 is an important change for the future, to banish the bandit of bracket creep \u2013 which the Labor party is still wrestling with itself over \u2013 making sure that bandit can keep coming and taking from Australian\u2019s hard-earned [money],\u201d Morrison said on Monday. Labor, which stood against stage three of the still-to-be legislated tax plan at the last election is facing increasing pressure to support the government\u2019s whole plan, including the flat tax. On Monday the opposition announced a compromise position, asking for parts of the tax plan already legislated to be brought forward and the third stage delayed, as it struggles to land on a decision. But to allow stage three, which is due to come into effect in 2024, through the parliament would be reckless, Grudnoff said. \u201cThe government\u2019s changes to stage three of the tax cuts are the most fiscally reckless,\u201d he said. \u201cThe changes to stage two, while much smaller, still represent a high income tax cut. They will give more compensation to high income earners who have already been overcompensated the most for bracket creep. \u201cFiscal stimulus works better when money is given to low- and middle-income earners who tend to spend more of the stimulus. The government\u2019s changes to stage 2 do not represent the best use of money for fiscal stimulus as a significant amount of the extra funds will go to high-income earners who tend to save more of the stimulus.\u201d Labor has changed its language on high-income earners, with both Anthony Albanese and Jim Chalmers declaring workers on $200,000 are not \u201cthe top end of town\u201d. But both maintain it would be \u201ceconomically irresponsible\u201d to pass tax cuts for the highest income earners in the current economic climate. At a speech at the National Press Club on Tuesday, the shadow treasuer will urge the Coalition to do more to stimulate activity, saying the government must be held accountable for the \u201cfloundering\u201d economy. \u201cThe economy\u2019s floundering, middle Australia is struggling and the Reserve Bank is hurtling towards the end of the monetary policy runway, with coherent fiscal policy from the Liberals nowhere in sight,\u201d Chalmers will say. \u201cThere couldn\u2019t be a worse time for a government which has no idea how to turn things around.\u201d Amid the economic downturn, the interest rates are are heading for unprecedented lows below 1% and the Reserve Bank could even be forced into extraordinary measures such as money printing to stimulate the struggling economy, forecasters believe.

      "bodyText": "On Monday the prime minister gave a speech to the WA Chamber of Commerce that outlined some economic policies he planned to pursue. Chief among them was cutting red tape (apparently the past six years have not afforded them the opportunity to do this). It was a very tepid response to an economic situation that demands much more serious attention. Last week for the first time ever Australian government two-year and three-year bonds fell below 1%, and then on Friday so too did the rate (or \u201cyield\u201d) for five-year bonds: I know bond yields are not the sexiest of subjects (unless you go in for that kind of thing and, knowing my readers, there are a few of you out there who do!) but they give us a good insight into where the economy is likely heading. They also put paid to any hogwash that the government could rightly have claimed during the election campaign that the fundamentals of the economy were strong. Government bonds are essentially how the government borrows money. Right now the government has borrowed $541bn worth of money via bond issues and they are for various time periods \u2013 think of it like a term deposit. Now just like you taking out a term deposit at a bank, the government has to offer an interest rate (known as a yield) to entice investors to give them their money. Because the Australian government will not go bust, the interest rates for bonds are lower than bank term deposits, and generally the government needs to offer higher rates the longer the bond is. Again think of it like a term deposit \u2013 if you were to give the government $100,000 for a year you might be happy with getting that $100,000 plus 2% in 12 months time because you are pretty sure what the inflation rate will be and also your likely return from other investments like shares. And this is where bonds start to be very good for telling us about the future. The Australian government two-year bond rate for example is a very good indicator of what is going to happen to the cash rate: Because the yield for the two-year bonds is now below 1%, it is highly suggestive that the cash rate is headed that way as well. But bond yields also tell us a bit about whether things are expected to get better or worse. Imagine if instead of one year you were to give the government that money for five years. You would now want more than 2% each year because that is five years during which you don\u2019t have that $100,000 to invest elsewhere \u2013 say the stock market. You would also expect the economy will grow and inflation growth also likely to increase. You therefore want more than 2% to make up for the penalty of not being able to use that $100,000 elsewhere for five years. So as a rule the yields increase as the length of the bond increases. But what if investors think over the next five years the economy is going to turn bad \u2013 that profits will dry up, that inflation growth will fall? Instead of investing in shares they will seek the safety of government bonds \u2013 and this increased demand for bonds means the government can lower the interest rate it offers, because investors are desperate for security. When this happens, the yield for five-year and 10-year bonds gets closer to that of one-year and two-year bonds. But if investors think the economy is going to tank, they will become so desperate for long-term security that the yield for five- and 10-year bonds will actually become lower than it is for one-year bonds. This is what is called a \u201cnegative yield curve\u201d and it has long been a good indicator of a recession. And it is what has started to happen in the past six months. Normally the five-year bond yield is on average about 0.3 percentage points higher than for the two-year bond; now it is around 0.05% pts. Earlier this year \u2013 in fact around the time the budget was being handed down \u2013 it was actually lower: It was very clear at the time of the budget that things were turning bad. And while some of the falling rates is due to the US (Australia competes with other countries for investors), the reality is our bond yields have fallen by more than those in the US have \u2013 suggesting our outlook is worsening by more than that of America: The outlook in the US is not good, and it has changed quickly. Eight months ago, a one month US treasury bond had a yield of 2.18%, and a three-year bond had a yield of 2.99% \u2013 pretty much what you would expect when things seem to be going well. Now however that one month bond has a yield of 2.16% but the three year bond yield is just 1.74%. And we should note the three-year bond yield was already lower than the one-month bond at the time the budget was handed down: That is a recession outlook. The last time the three-year US bond yield was that much lower than the one-month yield was in 2007 \u2013 just before the GFC was about to hit. So the government cannot claim this worsening outlook took them by surprise. And now, three months after the budget was handed down, they need to acknowledge they got the settings wrong and they need to start responding to the faltering economy. And some lame guff about cutting red tape is not going to be anywhere near enough. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a columnist for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "The so-called Nauru 19\u2019s fight against prosecution is \u201cback at square one\u201d after a court of appeal threw out a permanent stay of prosecution on Friday. The ruling, which was based largely on technicalities of jurisdiction, reopens the prospect of trial for the Nauruan group, which includes former MPs, over charges related to anti-government protests in 2015. In September an independently appointed supreme court judge, Geoffrey Muecke, found the group of Nauruans were deemed to have no prospect of receiving a fair trial because of the \u201cshameful\u201d lengths the government had gone to in seeking their imprisonment. Muecke said the government was \u201cwilling to expend whatever resources, including financial resources, as are required to achieve that aim\u201d, including operating an unwritten blacklist to ensure the Nauru 19 were unable to find work on the island, rent houses, or, in some cases, leave the country. He granted a permanent stay of prosecution against the group and ordered that the Republic of Nauru pay more than $300,000 in court costs. However, the government fought the ruling and on Friday the Nauru court of appeal \u2013 which was established late last year after the Nauru government quietly severed longstanding ties with the Australian high court \u2013 threw out all of Muecke\u2019s orders. The ruling, by justices Sir Albert R Palmer, Nicholas Kirriwom and Michael Dishington Scott, said Muecke had been appointed to the supreme court solely for the purpose of hearing and deciding the criminal case against the group, and \u201cwent beyond his jurisdiction in entertaining\u201d constitutional issues. Mathew Batsiua, a former Nauruan minister and member of the Nauru 19, said the judgement was \u201cfrustrating\u201d but that it was highly technical and did not rule against any of the findings made by Muecke about the conduct of the Nauruan government. \u201cAs I see it we are basically back to square one,\u201d he said. \u201cA potential next step open to us is to again seek a permanent stay of proceedings, on all the grounds that have previously been raised. These could include challenging the new law that blocks access to foreign lawyers, [but] this time before a judge who has the power to determine constitutional issues.\u201d Friday\u2019s ruling said Muecke\u2019s decision to grant a permanent stay rather than an interim or conditional one was an \u201cextreme step\u201d, which should not be taken \u201cunless the court is satisfied that the continuation of the prosecution is oppressive, vexatious and inconsistent with the recognised purposes of the administration of criminal justice and therefore constitutes an abuse of the process of the court\u201d. The Nauru 19 had in fact put forward that their prosecution was severe enough to breach constitutional rights to a fair trial but the appeal judges dismissed Muecke\u2019s ruling because thy said he had no jurisdiction to rule on constitutionality. A second argument that the original protests were provoked \u201cby grave executive illegality\u201d, which undermined Nauruan democracy and rule of law, raised questions of fact that could only be addressed at trial, the ruling said. Muecke\u2019s original judgment was a damning indictment on the conduct of the Nauruan government and included accusations that legislation limiting legal aid had been introduced to \u201cfrustrate\u201d the defendants\u2019 legal efforts. However, the appeal judges found that conclusion to be \u201cunacceptably speculative\u201d, and reached by \u201ca process of reasoning which we have to say we find to be quite unnecessarily tenuous\u201d. They said the serious question of whether the defendants were refused legal assistance was not adequately investigated. The long-running case stems from a 2015 rally, protesting against the expulsion from parliament of three MPs who had criticised the government in media interviews. The rally escalated and rocks were thrown through parliament\u2019s windows. Nineteen people were charged with various offences including rioting. Some pleaded guilty but most defended themselves. A lead respondent to the case, former Nauruan president Sprent Dabwido, died earlier this year, following terminal cancer, which he, his family, lawyer and doctor claim was exacerbated by the government holding his passport and preventing him from seeking treatment overseas. The judgment also accused the Nauru 19\u2019s legal team of addressing the court in an \u201cintemperate and disrespectful manner\u201d in submitting a document suggesting that any decision remitting the matter for trial could be perceived by observers as \u201crepresenting that this court is the plaything of the executive or at best a court which erroneously placed all weight on the interest of prosecuting crimes \u2026 and no weight on protecting human rights\u201d. The Nauruan government welcomed the ruling, saying the court of appeal\u2019s first decision heralded a \u201cnew era\u201d. \u201cMinister of justice Hon David Adeang MP said the first sitting of the court was historic and highlighted the great strides Nauru has made in creating an accountable and high-quality justice system, something the Waqa government made a priority when it took office in 2013,\u201d the government said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p>The New South Wales opposition has warned that the state\u2019s anti-corruption and integrity watchdogs are being starved of funding despite increasing workloads and threadbare staffing.</p> <p>The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) was given what the NSW government <a href=\"https://www.nsw.gov.au/your-government/the-premier/media-releases-from-the-premier/record-funding-for-the-icac/\">described as \u201crecord\u201d funding</a> in 2017-18, amounting to $27m a year for four years.</p> <p>But Icac\u2019s expenses spiked to $28.7m last year due to the complexity of its investigations, which brought unforeseen legal and transcription costs.</p> <p>This year, the budget has dropped by $2.9m to $25.8m, a reduction of 10%, though the government says this is still above previous average funding levels.</p> <p>Icac\u2019s staffing levels, meanwhile, are at near-record lows, according to the most recent figures. Average staffing was 104.96 and 98.07 fulltime equivalents in 2017-18 and 2016-17 respectively, well below the levels seen prior to 2015-16.</p> <p>Icac\u2019s staffing peaked at 126.4 fulltime staff in 2013-14.</p> <p>The number of matters received by Icac \u2013 including public complaints, referrals, and own-motion investigations \u2013 has climbed from 2,436 to 2,751 in the past two financial years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-24T04:36:23/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-24T04:36:23/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>The shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, is also concerned about reduced or stagnating budgets for a range of other integrity agencies.</p> <p>The NSW ombudsman had its funding reduced by almost $1m in last week\u2019s budget.</p> <p>Lynch said the budgets for the information and privacy commissioner and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission had also failed to keep pace with inflation.</p> <p>\u201cThis government\u2019s commitment to integrity in government is pretty shaky,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cDespite their rhetoric, if they\u2019re not funding investigative and accountability agencies properly, then they\u2019re just not putting a priority on integrity.</p> <p>\u201cThese agencies can\u2019t do their job if they are subjected to restricted funding.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-24T04:39:48/embed.html\" data-alt=\"chart\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/jun/2019-06-24T04:39:48/embed.html\">chart</a> </figure>  <p>Special minister of state, Don Harwin, rejected suggestions NSW\u2019s integrity bodies were being denied adequate funding. Harwin said last year Icac was provided with supplementary funding during the course of the year, and any future in-year funding requests made by Icac would be considered by the government.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2018-19, we provided the ICAC with record funding of $106 million over four years, and the ICAC\u2019s expense budget of $25.8 million in 2019-20 remains at historically high levels, up from previous annual average levels of $24 million per year,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIn accordance with existing practice, the ICAC was granted in-year supplementary grant funding during 2018-19 to deal with specific investigations, a fact reflected in the $1.54 million increase in other operating expenses between the 2018-19 Budget and Revised figures.\u201d</p> <p>Harwin also said Icac\u2019s employee-related funding would increase from 2018-19 to 2019-20. He said combined funding fir the LECC, Ombudsman, and IPC had increased this year. </p> <p>Icac declined to comment on its budget. But in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/nov/02/icac-forced-to-lay-off-investigators-as-budget-slashed-by-800000\">it warned cuts had forced it to reduce the number</a> of investigators and \u201cmeet the challenges in delivering investigation outcomes\u201d as a result of \u201csignificant\u201d funding cuts. Icac revealed it had hired temporary investigators to meet demand and reduced the number of its investigative units from four to three.</p> <p>The Public Service Association\u2019s assistant secretary, Troy Wright, said the current government had been \u201cripping teeth out of the corruption watchdog one by one\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cCorruption doesn\u2019t stay still \u2013 it evolves and changes as corrupt people seek to exploit any weakness,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThat is why funding levels are so important because we have to fun proper investigations and punish those who take advantage.</p> <p>\u201cCorrupt politicians have feared Icac for a generation because it has real teeth. This government has been ripping teeth out of the corruption watchdog one by one. A gummy corrupt watchdog ensures that corrupt practises will go unpunished and corrupt people will prosper and the incentive for corruption will rise.\u201d</p> <p>Icac underwent significant reform in late 2016, when the NSW parliament passed changes that significantly altered its structure, powers, and oversight.</p> <p>Icac became a three-member commission, which required the authorisation of the chief commissioner and at least one other commissioner to hold a public inquiry. It was also required to give affected persons a reasonable opportunity to respond before it made adverse findings about them.</p> <p>The last Labor budget for Icac in 2010-11 gave the agency $19.85m.</p> <p>The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was approached for comment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales opposition has warned that the state\u2019s anti-corruption and integrity watchdogs are being starved of funding despite increasing workloads and threadbare staffing. The Independent Commission Against Corruption (Icac) was given what the NSW government described as \u201crecord\u201d funding in 2017-18, amounting to $27m a year for four years. But Icac\u2019s expenses spiked to $28.7m last year due to the complexity of its investigations, which brought unforeseen legal and transcription costs. This year, the budget has dropped by $2.9m to $25.8m, a reduction of 10%, though the government says this is still above previous average funding levels. Icac\u2019s staffing levels, meanwhile, are at near-record lows, according to the most recent figures. Average staffing was 104.96 and 98.07 fulltime equivalents in 2017-18 and 2016-17 respectively, well below the levels seen prior to 2015-16. Icac\u2019s staffing peaked at 126.4 fulltime staff in 2013-14. The number of matters received by Icac \u2013 including public complaints, referrals, and own-motion investigations \u2013 has climbed from 2,436 to 2,751 in the past two financial years. The shadow attorney general, Paul Lynch, is also concerned about reduced or stagnating budgets for a range of other integrity agencies. The NSW ombudsman had its funding reduced by almost $1m in last week\u2019s budget. Lynch said the budgets for the information and privacy commissioner and the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission had also failed to keep pace with inflation. \u201cThis government\u2019s commitment to integrity in government is pretty shaky,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cDespite their rhetoric, if they\u2019re not funding investigative and accountability agencies properly, then they\u2019re just not putting a priority on integrity. \u201cThese agencies can\u2019t do their job if they are subjected to restricted funding.\u201d Special minister of state, Don Harwin, rejected suggestions NSW\u2019s integrity bodies were being denied adequate funding. Harwin said last year Icac was provided with supplementary funding during the course of the year, and any future in-year funding requests made by Icac would be considered by the government. \u201cIn 2018-19, we provided the ICAC with record funding of $106 million over four years, and the ICAC\u2019s expense budget of $25.8 million in 2019-20 remains at historically high levels, up from previous annual average levels of $24 million per year,\u201d he said. \u201cIn accordance with existing practice, the ICAC was granted in-year supplementary grant funding during 2018-19 to deal with specific investigations, a fact reflected in the $1.54 million increase in other operating expenses between the 2018-19 Budget and Revised figures.\u201d Harwin also said Icac\u2019s employee-related funding would increase from 2018-19 to 2019-20. He said combined funding fir the LECC, Ombudsman, and IPC had increased this year. Icac declined to comment on its budget. But in 2017 it warned cuts had forced it to reduce the number of investigators and \u201cmeet the challenges in delivering investigation outcomes\u201d as a result of \u201csignificant\u201d funding cuts. Icac revealed it had hired temporary investigators to meet demand and reduced the number of its investigative units from four to three. The Public Service Association\u2019s assistant secretary, Troy Wright, said the current government had been \u201cripping teeth out of the corruption watchdog one by one\u201d. \u201cCorruption doesn\u2019t stay still \u2013 it evolves and changes as corrupt people seek to exploit any weakness,\u201d Wright said. \u201cThat is why funding levels are so important because we have to fun proper investigations and punish those who take advantage. \u201cCorrupt politicians have feared Icac for a generation because it has real teeth. This government has been ripping teeth out of the corruption watchdog one by one. A gummy corrupt watchdog ensures that corrupt practises will go unpunished and corrupt people will prosper and the incentive for corruption will rise.\u201d Icac underwent significant reform in late 2016, when the NSW parliament passed changes that significantly altered its structure, powers, and oversight. Icac became a three-member commission, which required the authorisation of the chief commissioner and at least one other commissioner to hold a public inquiry. It was also required to give affected persons a reasonable opportunity to respond before it made adverse findings about them. The last Labor budget for Icac in 2010-11 gave the agency $19.85m. The premier, Gladys Berejiklian, was approached for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Last May a fisherman in Papua New Guinea went out hunting for shark. But instead of coming home with fish to feed his family he returned with an unexpected catch: A$50m worth of cocaine. The fisherman was working in the waters near an uninhabited atoll close to his home island of Budi Budi, off the eastern coast of the country, when he found a piece of rope. Following it, he found a disturbed patch of sand and buried in the sand were 11 black duffel bags filled with bars of white powder. Within two weeks, his chance find would lead to his remote community being threatened by a drug gang, a week-long open-ocean police boat chase, a booby-trapped fishing vessel running aground on a reef, and the disappearance of the huge cocaine haul. It is one of a string of bizarre stories that have emerged with the rise of drug trafficking through the Pacific, a multibillion-dollar industry that involves cocaine and meth being packed into the hulls of yachts in the US, Latin America and China and sailed to Australia and New Zealand via island nations including Fiji, Tonga and New Caledonia. As part of the Guardian\u2019s investigation into the route, outlandish stories have emerged: tales of Fijians bumping into huge underwater storage nets filled with cocaine while out on boat trips, and of cocaine washing up on a remote island where locals initially mistook it for washing powder. But the Budi Budi story, which was first reported outside PNG by the Australian, is \u201cthe first of its kind\u201d for Papua New Guinea, says Constable Augustine Bengin from the Milne Bay province police, who was called out to the remote island to investigate last May. Budi Budi is part of Papua New Guinea, but only just. The tiny speck of land is 700km (435 miles) from the capital, Port Moresby. There are no police on Budi Budi and the force based at the provincial capital of Alotau, 370km away, have just 40 officers to cover 600 atolls.

They were all afraid to touch the powder, fearing it would harm them. \u201cThey thought it was poisonous,\u201d Bengin says. The community reported the discovery to the mainland via radio but before police could get there a gang of six Chinese men and one Montenegrin arrived on Budi Budi looking for their stash. \u201cThey threatened the village people,\u201d Bengin says. \u201cThey were frightened so they gave them the bags back. It\u2019s a very isolated island \u2013 anything could have happened.\u201d The gang opened one of the packages and sampled some of the product, becoming aggressive and threatening to fight the villagers. To placate them, the villagers traded with the gang, swapping vegetables and coconuts for rice and fishing line. Meanwhile, the man in charge of the island\u2019s two-way radio had managed to hide away one pack of the drugs, containing six 1kg bricks of cocaine, to give to the police for evidence. By the time the police arrived \u2013 three or four days after the original radio call from the villagers \u2013 the gang and the drugs had gone. Bengin says the PNG navy sent out a boat and, after a week hunting the vessel, tracked it down on the water. \u201cWhen they found the boat it wasn\u2019t travelling, it was floating, they said they had a problem with the engines,\u201d Bengin says. Police and navy arrested the men but the gang members had booby-trapped the boat, filling it with petrol, which made it too noxious to search. Police tried towing it but it was too heavy.

The Guardian contacted the PNG Royal Constabulary, the National Maritime Safety Authority of PNG and the Australian federal police for comment, but none could confirm what had happened to the drugs. Bengin\u2019s understanding is that the boat was never able to be fully searched and, as it was too heavy to pull to the mainland, it still sits, heavy and toxic with oil, grounded on the reef.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has ordered new sanctions against Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and other officials including eight Revolutionary Guard commanders in the latest step of an escalating pressure campaign. Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, will also face fresh sanctions in a few days, US officials said. He negotiated the 2015 nuclear deal with the US and other major powers, and has spearheaded Iranian diplomacy since. Signing an executive order in the Oval Office, Trump called the increased sanctions \u201chard-hitting\u201d, saying they would deny the supreme leader, his office and and those closely affiliated with him access to key financial resources. \u201cThese measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran\u2019s increasingly provocative actions,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe do not seek conflict with Iran or any other country,\u201d the US president added. \u201cI can only tell you we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon.\u201d Standing alongside Trump, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, said the measures would freeze billions of dollars in Iranian assets. But analysts said their impact on an already heavily-sanctioned country would be limited \u201cThe newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,\u201d said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThis is certainly true \u2026 because the newly sanctioned people and entities are already insulated from the international financial system.\u201d A treasury statement said eight senior commanders of the navy, aerospace and ground forces components of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) were also being targeted. \u201cThese commanders sit atop a bureaucracy that supervises the IRGC\u2019s malicious regional activities, including its provocative ballistic missile program, harassment and sabotage of commercial vessels in international waters, and its destabilizing presence in Syria,\u201d the statement said. Trump said he was willing to pursue dialogue with Tehran without preconditions, but the sanctions appear to make such talks even less likely, at least in the short term, particular if the US follows through its threat to sanction Zarif. The Iranian ambassador to the UN, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, said: \u201cNo one in clear mind can have a dialogue with somebody who is threatening you with sanctions as long as that is still there is no way we can have a dialogue.\u201d Ravanchi instead urged the UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, to broker regional talks involving Iran and its neighbours. Khamenei and his family are said to control a business empire worth tens of billions of dollars. \u201cThe supreme leader\u2019s office has enriched itself at the expense of the Iranian people,\u201d the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said. \u201cIt sits atop a vast network of tyranny and corruption that deprives the Iranian people of the freedom and opportunity they deserve.\u201d Tension has been mounting in the Gulf since Trump withdrew the US from a multilateral deal in which Iran accepted strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions. Those tensions have culminated in the sabotaging of tankers in the Persian Gulf, and the shooting down of a US drone on Thursday. Trump ordered airstrikes in reprisal, but then cancelled them. \u201cI think a lot of restraint has been shown by us, and that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to show it in the future,\u201d Trump said on Monday.

Iran has denied responsibility for the blasts. Hook, seen as one of the hawks on Iran inside the US administration, said Tehran faced a choice: \u201cThey can either start coming to the negotiating table or they can watch their economy continue to crumble.\u201d Tensions with Iran have been mounting since Donald Trump withdrew the US from the 2015 nuclear deal last year and began applying pressure on Tehran through economic sanctions. Trump tweeted that other countries, including China and Japan, should protect their own oil tankers in the Middle East. \u201cWhy are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries \u2026 for zero compensation,\u201d he wrote. Meanwhile, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, met Saudi Arabia\u2019s king and crown prince for talks on Monday as the US sought to promote an anti-Iran alliance. \u201cYou are a dear friend,\u201d King Salman told Pompeo, who was due to fly to the United Arab Emirates later on Monday for further discussions. Iran has said it will not enter into discussions until sanctions are lifted. The fresh round of US sanctions is however an attempt to force the Iranian leadership to hold talks with the US. A near-total ban on oil exports is already in place. A drone strike on an airport in Saudi Arabia by Iranian-aligned Houthi rebels, which left one person dead and 21 injured, will have coloured the mood among Gulf states. It follows another attack on 12 June. Hook is also to meet officials from Britain, France and Germany this week, but declined to say what pressure he will putting on those countries to follow the US out of the nuclear deal with Iran if, as Tehran has threatened, it breaches its permitted uranium enrichment stock levels on Thursday. The EU has the choice of either putting the issue in the nuclear deal dispute mechanism, or threatening its own retaliatory measures. Germany appeared cool towards US talk of building a global coalition against Iran. A foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday that Berlin had \u201ctaken note via the media\u201d of Pompeo\u2019s comments and added that \u201cour top aim is and remains a de-escalation of the serious situation\u201d. Hook claimed the EU was being subjected to nuclear blackmail by Iran, and claimed Iran had rejected the opportunity to take various diplomatic \u201coff-ramps\u201d in the past year. The UK, France and Germany are urging Tehran to wait for European countries to set up the much-delayed financial mechanism designed to help businesses in Europe trade with Iran, circumventing secondary US sanctions.

Instead of the customary thumbs up or little wave as Ben\u00edtez turned on his heel and wandered off there were firm handshakes and, for this reporter, a kiss from Newcastle United\u2019s manager.</p> \n<p>It could have been something or nothing but, at the time it rang slight alarm bells. Was Newcastle\u2019s best manager since Sir Bobby Robson saying \u201cgoodbye?\u201d Had the erosion of trust in his relationship with the club\u2019s owner dictated that Ben\u00edtez would not be returning to the city he had fallen at least half in love with and the club he once dreamed of leading back into Europe?</p> \n<p>Discussions with Ashley dragged on and talk \u2013 yet again \u2013 of a potential Emirati takeover promised, tantalisingly, to change the narrative but, on Monday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/rafael-benitez-leaving-newcastle-contract-expires-30-june\" title=\"\">the fears raised in that corridor were realised</a>.</p> \n<p>Some of those who know the Spaniard well are convinced he has had at least one foot in the departure lounge for a good couple of months now and few could blame him. At 59, Ben\u00edtez feels he has another decade left in management. As a serial winner of trophies who thrives on big European nights, part of him knew his talents were in serious danger of being wasted on Tyneside.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfdcd205002961937d39e5bef41dcc4fb86b0084\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfdcd205002961937d39e5bef41dcc4fb86b0084/202_269_3386_2031/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Many Newcastle fans had suggested that they would vote with their feet if Rafa Ben\u00edtez left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many Newcastle fans had suggested that they would vote with their feet if Rafa Ben\u00edtez left.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Jay Barratt - AMA/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The frustration is that so much was perfect; the 52,000 full houses, the almost unconditional love from fans who repeatedly chanted \u201cRafa Ben\u00edtez; we want you to stay,\u201d the citadel-like stadium situated right in the city centre.</p> \n<p>As a city Newcastle shares many similarities with Liverpool and it was no surprise it seemed like a natural habitat for a man who enjoyed one of the happiest, and most successful, periods of his career on Merseyside, where his family home remains.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/11/rafael-benitez-waiting-answers-newcastle-owner-mike-ashley\">Ben\u00edtez likens Newcastle contract talks with Ashley to Brexit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indeed, Ben\u00edtez had long had a soft spot for what would become his adopted home on Gallowgate.

      "bodyText": "Last season was drawing to a close when Rafael Ben\u00edtez stood in a quiet corridor at St James\u2019 Park briefing a small group of newspaper journalists on his seemingly interminable negotiations over a new contract with Mike Ashley. Little of substance was said but, as the conversation drew to a close, something unusual happened. Instead of the customary thumbs up or little wave as Ben\u00edtez turned on his heel and wandered off there were firm handshakes and, for this reporter, a kiss from Newcastle United\u2019s manager. It could have been something or nothing but, at the time it rang slight alarm bells. Was Newcastle\u2019s best manager since Sir Bobby Robson saying \u201cgoodbye?\u201d Had the erosion of trust in his relationship with the club\u2019s owner dictated that Ben\u00edtez would not be returning to the city he had fallen at least half in love with and the club he once dreamed of leading back into Europe? Discussions with Ashley dragged on and talk \u2013 yet again \u2013 of a potential Emirati takeover promised, tantalisingly, to change the narrative but, on Monday the fears raised in that corridor were realised. Some of those who know the Spaniard well are convinced he has had at least one foot in the departure lounge for a good couple of months now and few could blame him. At 59, Ben\u00edtez feels he has another decade left in management. As a serial winner of trophies who thrives on big European nights, part of him knew his talents were in serious danger of being wasted on Tyneside. The frustration is that so much was perfect; the 52,000 full houses, the almost unconditional love from fans who repeatedly chanted \u201cRafa Ben\u00edtez; we want you to stay,\u201d the citadel-like stadium situated right in the city centre. As a city Newcastle shares many similarities with Liverpool and it was no surprise it seemed like a natural habitat for a man who enjoyed one of the happiest, and most successful, periods of his career on Merseyside, where his family home remains. Indeed, Ben\u00edtez had long had a soft spot for what would become his adopted home on Gallowgate. During an interlude as Chelsea manager, he stood in that aforementioned St James\u2019 corridor following a defeat inflicted by Alan Pardew\u2019s then side and, as he debriefed reporters, there was a definite sense that he rather envied Pardew\u2019s job. So much so that when Ashley sacked Steve McClaren, Ben\u00edtez swiftly made it clear he was available \u2013 it was not long after his departure from Real Madrid \u2013 and rather fancied stepping in. Initially he joined on a nine-game contract but when, through no fault of his own, Newcastle were relegated that season, he shocked a lot of people by agreeing to drop down into the Championship with them. Promotion swiftly followed \u2013 but the celebrations had barely subsided before things started to go wrong. Ben\u00edtez and Ashley are both, to differing degrees and in contrasting ways, control freaks, both men are enigmatic and their partnership was never going to be straightforward. Perhaps fearing that Ben\u00edtez\u2019s political manoeuvres might push him into unwelcome corners, Ashley managed things by very rarely speaking to, and almost never meeting, his manager. This dysfunctional union was held together by Lee Charnley, the club\u2019s managing director, who frequently struggled to satisfy two such invariably incompatible masters. Money is Ashley\u2019s main motivator and possibly he struggled to understand why Ben\u00edtez\u2019s \u00a36m-a-year contract was not enough. But the manager did not like the retail tycoon\u2019s policy of signing players only aged 25 and under so that they possessed decent resale value. He wanted to leaven youth with experience, to revamp Newcastle\u2019s academy and radically overhaul a training ground which, compared with those of some Premier League counterparts, was more functional-yet-tired mid-range hotel than modernist six-star spa resort. And then there was the budget: the owner envisaged spending around \u00a350m on transfers this summer, his head coach would have preferred at least double that amount. But it was more than merely about pure figures; Ben\u00edtez became increasingly disturbed by how long it took Ashley to execute any potential deal, how everything had to go through not just Charnley but the owner\u2019s fixer, the lawyer Justin Barnes. The striker Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n became a bit of a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for Ben\u00edtez\u2019s philosophy. The West Brom forward who joined on loan was much too close to 30 for Ashley\u2019s liking but his goals and all-round excellence at centre-forward played a big part in preserving Newcastle\u2019s Premier League status for a second season running and the manager believed it was imperative he should be signed on an expensive, permanent deal. Ashley, though, could not seem to understand why the former Champions League-winning coach was so hooked up on the player and his reluctance to spend the money on the Venezuelan quite possibly kiboshed any hopes of a contract extension. If part of Ben\u00edtez always knew he was leaving this summer, maybe another part hoped Ashley would finally blink first. When, a couple of weeks ago, his camp started briefing that Chelsea might, slightly startlingly, want him back it appeared part of a classic game to push Ashley into accepting his demands. The news that he could command a \u00a312m-a-year salary in China looked a similar ploy but the resultant headlines failed to produce the desired breakthrough and Newcastle are left seeking a new manager able to reprise Ben\u00edtez\u2019s feat in somehow avoiding relegation by coaxing one of the Premier League\u2019s weakest squads into significant overachievement. That newcomer can expect to meet closed hearts and minds on Tyneside. The emotional barriers threaten to be formidable; whoever they are and however good they may be, they will not be Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Maybe one day Ashley will reflect on precisely how he let the best manager he ever had slip through his fingers. First, though, he will need to understand why Ben\u00edtez spent more than three years trying, forlornly, to tell him that it really is pointless knowing the price of everything if you don\u2019t appreciate the value of anything.",

      "bodyText": "A second major shareholder has joined an investor drive to eject the board of FirstGroup as the transport group faces an emergency meeting on Tuesday that could result in Britain\u2019s most lucrative rail franchise again slipping from its grasp. Columbia Threadneedle said it was backing resolutions brought by activist investor Coast Capital to replace seven directors including the chairman and chief executive of the one of the UK\u2019s biggest bus and train operators. Columbia and Coast each own about 10% of the shares, slightly more than Schroders, which was reported by Sky News to be planning to vote against the board but has not yet confirmed its position. The meeting comes at a crucial moment for FirstGroup as it awaits the award of the West Coast partnership franchise, which will operate intercity trains on the London-Glasgow line and help introduce the first HS2 highspeed services after 2026. FirstGroup, backed by Italy\u2019s state-owned Trenitalia, has been rumoured for several weeks to be the preferred bidder in a remaining shortlist of two, against a bid led by Hong King\u2019s MTR. According to industry sources, the decision was taken within the Department for Transport last month. However, the award of the franchise has been deferred until the outcome of the Coast manoeuvres, which could potentially leave the DfT in another embarrassing franchising crisis should the board be replaced. Coast, a New York based hedge fund, has demanded that FirstGroup exits UK rail which it has described as \u201cextraordinarily destructive of capital\u201d. James Rasteh of Coast has threatened to sue, and to \u201chold each member of management team and board member personally and fully accountable\u201d if FirstGroup accepts any new rail franchise. The company has made writedowns of more than \u00a3100m already on each of its last two franchise wins: TransPennine and South Western, and the size of its bid to win West Coast could further anger shareholders if it significantly exceeds MTR\u2019s. Legal action over the franchise is also being brought against the DfT by Stagecoach, Virgin\u2019s partner in running the West Coast route since privatisation. Stagecoach has been seeking to overturn its disqualification from the competition for a non-compliant bid, refusing to accept pension liabilities. FirstGroup last month indicated it might turn its back on UK rail after the expiry of its current contracts, which also include Great Western Railway and the open access operator Hull Trains.

In <a href=\"https://www.snp.org/nicola-sturgeons-speech-at-the-law-society-of-scotland/\">a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of devolution,</a> she ridiculed the traditional English claim that first-past-the-post delivers strong and stable government. She said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Perhaps most importantly of all, the Scottish parliament was always envisaged as a place where parties would have to seek compromise and consensus. The use of proportional representation in elections is the key reason for that. </p> <p>By contrast, the first past the post system used at Westminster is clearly unsuited to an age of multi-party politics. And the claim that used to be made for it was that it delivered strong and stable government. Nobody looking to Westminster at present would make that case.</p> <p>The emphasis on consensus at Holyrood is even reflected in the design of the parliament. MSPs sit in a horseshoe. At Westminster, MPs face each other- in a chamber designed to keep them two swords\u2019 lengths apart. </p> <p>I don\u2019t want to idealise the Scottish parliament too much. Anybody who watches first minister\u2019s questions will know that consensus has limits. </p> <p>Parties at Holyrood seek political advantage and argue strongly against each other \u2013 of course we do. But we also get a lot done. And we consistently work together. All of the legislative successes I\u2019ve mentioned had the support of more than one party. Several were passed unanimously. </p> <p>And it\u2019s hard not to look at Westminster \u2013 and particularly the deadlock that exists over Brexit \u2013 without thinking that these cultural differences have real consequences. The UK government\u2019s consistent inability to reach out to parties other than the DUP has been striking. And that\u2019s maybe partly because confrontation \u2013 not compromise \u2013 is inherent in the UK parliament\u2019s design, traditions and working methods. </p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b481b496a51b2bb5cf2e9d6d09db6b4c55fa0869\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b481b496a51b2bb5cf2e9d6d09db6b4c55fa0869/289_17_2090_1254/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicola Sturgeon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicola Sturgeon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: WPA Pool/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T16:52:33.416Z\">at 5.52pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d10f8af8f080e828514e9e6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-24T16:37:14.297Z\">5.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hunt would be better than Johnson at dealing with 3am emergency call, says Lidington</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most striking adverts in the 2008 US presidential election campaign asked voters who they would want answering the phone at 3am in the White House in a crisis. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">David Lidington,</strong> Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, who is now backing Jeremy Hunt, has been asking the same question. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh, where he has been attending a Law Society of Scotland, he said the key issue for Tories in choosing a new leader should be who would be best best for security.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I\u2019ve tried to weigh up in my mind the criteria. It seems to me first is which man is going to be better to shoulder the security responsibilities that come with the job of prime minister.</p> </blockquote> <p>Lidington said prime ministers had to consider how to respond to terror attacks and hostage situations. He went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister will have to take those decisions often under severe time pressure and almost inevitably on the basis of intelligence evidence that is by it\u2019s very nature going to be incomplete.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked who would deal best with these situations, Lidington said he would choose Hunt. Then, asked if he was saying Johnson did not have the temperament to be PM, Lidington replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I am not implying anything \u2026 I am saying very clearly from having worked with both of them in cabinet \u2026 In my judgement Jeremy is the one who is best equipped to deal with the 3am call.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZ_z9Tpdl9A\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aZ_z9Tpdl9A?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>Hillary Clinton 3am ad.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Lidington also criticised Johnson for avoiding the media.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think it\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s also unwise for him to duck out of interviews and debates. </p> <p>We\u2019re choosing not just a party leader, we\u2019re choosing a prime minister, so I think the country is entitled to know what both the candidates for that office would have as their priorities and how they would go about discharging those responsibilities.

However, I guess they had their priorities elsewhere when they went out to say it. What that has led to is that all the women\u2019s charities in this country have today had to issue a statement to assert that of course people should call the police, of course people should gather evidence where they can, and of course people should try and intervene.

The request to the EU would have to come from the PM. A responsible PM might make such a request in the event of a pending general election, to keep options for whoever won, but if Boris Johnson were in this position in September, he would probably argue that he was elected party leader and prime minister on a mandate to deliver Brexit by 31 October come what may.</p> <p>I\u2019m afraid the monarch has not had the power to sack the prime minister, and appoint another one, for at least a century, and probably longer.

A relative hardliner in Tory terms on immigration, she pushed hard for a high salary threshold for skilled workers coming to the UK after Brexit and, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-46613900\">when the government\u2019s white paper on immigration was published in December,</a> it proposed a rule saying migrants would have to be earning \u00a330,000 a year to qualify as a skilled worker for a five-year visa. As a concession to the Treasury and the business department, which wanted a more open regime, it was agreed that this threshold would be subject to consultation.</p> <p><strong>Sajid Javid,</strong> the home secretary, has now published<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/home-secretary-asks-independent-migration-experts-to-advise-on-future-salary-thresholds\"> details of that consultation </a>\u2013 and his announcement strongly applies that the salary thresholds in the white paper are going to be abandoned. He is also floating the idea of having different salary thresholds for different areas of the country. This is from the Home Office news release.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The home secretary Sajid Javid has today asked the migration advisory committee to review and advise on salary thresholds for the future immigration system, which will start to take effect from 2021.</p> <p>The migration advisory committee previously recommended that we should retain the existing minimum salary thresholds in the future immigration system, which includes paying experienced workers at least \u00a330,000, and new entrants (including recent graduates) at least \u00a320,800.</p> <p>The home secretary has asked the migration advisory committee to consider how future salary thresholds should be calculated, the levels of salary thresholds, whether there is a case for regional salary thresholds for different parts of the UK, and whether there should be exceptions to salary thresholds, for example because they\u2019ve newly started the occupation or because they work in an occupation in shortage. </p> </blockquote> <p>A final decision would be taken by the next Tory MP (assuming the Conservatives stay in power). But Javid will be making this announcement knowing that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are much more relaxed about immigration than May. </p> <p>Variable salary thresholds for different parts of the UK would be a policy with particular significance for Scotland, which is much more dependent on immigration than other parts of the UK. The SNP-led Scottish government has for years been saying it should have control over immigration policy in Scotland. At an event last week<strong> Nicola Sturgeon,</strong> Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/18/tory-leadership-bbc-debate-boris-johnson-voting-results-gets-fresh-boost-as-leadsom-gives-her-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c#block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c\">getting more power over immigration would be her top demand in terms of extending devolution</a>.

We have already heard the Tory MPs Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would vote against a Conservative government in a no-confidence debate to stop no deal, and MPs like Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart have hinted they might do the same. In an interview for the BBC, <strong>Tobias Ellwood</strong>, a defence minister, has said that in total about a dozen Tories would be willing to back a no-confidence motion in these circumstances. The government currently has a working majority, with the DUP, of around four, and so 12 Tories could easily bring down the new PM. Asked about Tory MPs supporting the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, denying the government Commons support to prevent no-deal, Ellwood said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I believe that absolutely is the case. </p> <p>I think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no-deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jeremy Hunt</strong>, Johnson\u2019s rival for the Conservative leadership, has been citing this as one reason why a Johnson administration could quickly collapse. Hunt has been doing a round of interviews this morning and he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>[Johnson] is going to come to power on a very fragile coalition of people like Matt Hancock who wants no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois who wants no deal.</p> <p>Sometimes in politics you can fudge and get away with it but in the case of Brexit you are going to have to make decisions immediately, and that very fragile coalition will collapse immediately when you have to make those decisions. </p> <p>If that happens we won\u2019t have another leadership contest, we will have Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 and there won\u2019t be any Brexit at all.</p> </blockquote> <p>Hunt also argued that this was why Johnson needed to stop dodging media scrutiny and agree to more TV debates, like the one planned by Sky tomorrow night (which Johnson is boycotting). <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/boris-johnson-is-a-coward-says-jeremy-hunt-wdt7v6qpm\">In an article in the Times (paywall)</a> this morning Hunt said Johnson was being a coward. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Boris has done just one interview on Today in the past year. I have done 16. He has not appeared on The Andrew Marr Show this year and his one broadcast interview of this campaign, with World at One, was arranged with just 10 minutes\u2019 notice so Mark Mardell had no time to prepare questions. And now he is refusing point blank to do TV debates. Pathetically, within hours of getting through to the final two he \u201cchallenged\u201d me to the ITV debate. I willingly accepted even though it was scheduled for three weeks later, after most members have received their postal votes and after many of them will have voted ...</p> <p>The first debate that Boris has been invited to will be on Sky News tomorrow evening. I\u2019ll be there. So don\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve.</p> </blockquote> <p>Here is the agenda for the day.</p> <p><em>9am:</em> Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, holds an LBC phone-in.</p> <p><em>9.35am:</em> Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, speaks at a conference where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/irish-border-kept-open-within-three-years-after-no-deal-brexit-says-report\">an interim report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission, which is looking at alternatives to the backstop, is being published.</a></p> <p><em>10.30am: </em>Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a press conference on postal votes.</p> <p><em>11am:</em> John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on the economy and Labour\u2019s plans for sustainable investment.</p> <p><em>11.20am:</em> Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives a speech to the Law Society of Edinburgh.</p> <p>As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has used a statement to the Commons to restate his call for any Brexit deal agreed by parliament to be put to the public in a second referendum. (See 4.07pm.) David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, has said he would trust Jeremy Hunt more than Boris Johnson to deal with a 3am emergency facing No 10. (See 5.37am.) Full police support would be needed for officials if they tried to go into nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to do Brexit checks, one of the authors of a report on alternative arrangements to the Irish border backstop has been told. Migrants coming to the UK could face varying minimum salary thresholds depending on where they live under proposals put out for review by the home secretary, Sajid Javid. Conservatives have stepped up warnings that a Boris Johnson premiership could lead to the collapse of the government if the leadership frontrunner attempts to pursue no deal. Boris Johnson does speak to Steve Bannon, Nigel Farage has said, increasing the pressure on the Conservative leadership frontrunner to explain his links to Donald Trump\u2019s controversial former campaign manager. Labour plans to give the Bank of England powers to help check the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency, John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. Thanks for the comments. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, also spoke at the Law Society of Scotland conference. In a speech to mark the 20th anniversary of devolution, she ridiculed the traditional English claim that first-past-the-post delivers strong and stable government. She said: Perhaps most importantly of all, the Scottish parliament was always envisaged as a place where parties would have to seek compromise and consensus. The use of proportional representation in elections is the key reason for that. By contrast, the first past the post system used at Westminster is clearly unsuited to an age of multi-party politics. And the claim that used to be made for it was that it delivered strong and stable government. Nobody looking to Westminster at present would make that case. The emphasis on consensus at Holyrood is even reflected in the design of the parliament. MSPs sit in a horseshoe. At Westminster, MPs face each other- in a chamber designed to keep them two swords\u2019 lengths apart. I don\u2019t want to idealise the Scottish parliament too much. Anybody who watches first minister\u2019s questions will know that consensus has limits. Parties at Holyrood seek political advantage and argue strongly against each other \u2013 of course we do. But we also get a lot done. And we consistently work together. All of the legislative successes I\u2019ve mentioned had the support of more than one party. Several were passed unanimously. And it\u2019s hard not to look at Westminster \u2013 and particularly the deadlock that exists over Brexit \u2013 without thinking that these cultural differences have real consequences. The UK government\u2019s consistent inability to reach out to parties other than the DUP has been striking. And that\u2019s maybe partly because confrontation \u2013 not compromise \u2013 is inherent in the UK parliament\u2019s design, traditions and working methods. One of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most striking adverts in the 2008 US presidential election campaign asked voters who they would want answering the phone at 3am in the White House in a crisis. David Lidington, Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, who is now backing Jeremy Hunt, has been asking the same question. Speaking to reporters in Edinburgh, where he has been attending a Law Society of Scotland, he said the key issue for Tories in choosing a new leader should be who would be best best for security. When I\u2019ve tried to weigh up in my mind the criteria. It seems to me first is which man is going to be better to shoulder the security responsibilities that come with the job of prime minister. Lidington said prime ministers had to consider how to respond to terror attacks and hostage situations. He went on: The prime minister will have to take those decisions often under severe time pressure and almost inevitably on the basis of intelligence evidence that is by it\u2019s very nature going to be incomplete. Asked who would deal best with these situations, Lidington said he would choose Hunt. Then, asked if he was saying Johnson did not have the temperament to be PM, Lidington replied: I am not implying anything \u2026 I am saying very clearly from having worked with both of them in cabinet \u2026 In my judgement Jeremy is the one who is best equipped to deal with the 3am call. Lidington also criticised Johnson for avoiding the media. I think it\u2019s wrong and it\u2019s also unwise for him to duck out of interviews and debates. We\u2019re choosing not just a party leader, we\u2019re choosing a prime minister, so I think the country is entitled to know what both the candidates for that office would have as their priorities and how they would go about discharging those responsibilities. So I hope he thinks again and I hope he does agree to take part. Over the weekend a lot of Boris Johnson supporters have been criticising the couple who alerted first the police, and then the Guardian, after they heard Johnson having a furious row with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, in her flat, involving loud screaming, shouting and banging. The police did attend the flat, and left after being satisfied that all was well. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, was typical of the those criticising the neighbours when he said this morning that they were \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d. (See 10.35am.) Speaking in the Commons on a point of order, the Labour MP Jess Phillips, who ran refuges for the Women\u2019s Aid Federation before entering parliament, said she was \u201cshocked and appalled\u201d this weekend to hear MPs suggesting that incidents like this were just private family matters. She went on: I\u2019m certain that in almost any circumstance people in this house don\u2019t believe that that is the case. However, I guess they had their priorities elsewhere when they went out to say it. What that has led to is that all the women\u2019s charities in this country have today had to issue a statement to assert that of course people should call the police, of course people should gather evidence where they can, and of course people should try and intervene. Because the message that came from this house ... was people should not try to help. Please, Mr Speaker, will you assert that domestic abuse is never just a domestic, it is never a personal family matter. Today\u2019s Evening Standard editorial claims that Sir Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary, has told Theresa May that she should only advise the Queen to appoint Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt as her successor if she is confident that they can command a majority in the Commons. Earlier this month Downing Street gave a briefing implying that May could delay her resignation if she thought that a successor like Johnson would not command the confidence of the Commons. Subsequently Number 10 said that the prime minister\u2019s spokesman\u2019s comments had been misunderstood, and that May would definitely be going as soon as the new Tory leader was elected. But what if it were to look as though a new leader like Johnson would lose an immediate confidence vote? Unfortunately the cabinet manual, which is the nearest thing the UK has to a constitutional rulebook, does not explain what should happen in a scenario exactly like this. But, as a recent report (pdf) from the public administration and constitutional affairs points out, the manual does imply that, if a PM loses a confidence vote, he or she is \u201cunder a duty not to resign unless and until it is clear another person commands the confidence of the house\u201d. In the Commons Tom Brake, the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman, asked May if she agreed that the new prime minister should come to the Commons before the summer recess to explain his Brexit plan, and to show that he had the confidence of the house. But May said this would be a matter for the next PM. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks if the new prime minister will address the Commons about Brexit within a week of taking office. It would be a disgrace if he waited until September, he says. May says this is not a matter for her. May suggests new prime minister may not face questions from MPs until September. Under a draft timetable for the announcement of the Tory leadership election winner, May\u2019s final PMQs and the start of recess, the new prime minister would take office the night before recess, meaning he probably would not face MPs for the first time until September. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Wesminster, also invited Theresa May to criticise Boris Johnson for suggesting that the UK would be able to negotiate changes to the backstop during the transition period. May did not really respond to this point when Jeremy Corbyn raised it, but she did second time round. Responding to Blackford, she said David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, refuted this claim in a tweet at the weekend. This is what Jeremy Corbyn said in his response to Theresa May about no deal: The two Tory leadership candidates are still saying that if they can\u2019t renegotiate the backstop \u2013 which the EU leaders said was not possible last week \u2013 then they would pursue a no-deal exit. Will the prime minister tell us, whether she believes no deal should be on the table as a viable option? And, in her view, what would be worse: crashing out with no deal in October, or putting this issue back to the people for a final say? And this is what Corbyn said Boris Johnson, and about a second referendum: Neither of the Tory leadership candidates have a credible plan. One even claims we can crash out on WTO terms and still trade without tariffs ... The former foreign secretary also told us that under his no-deal plan he could, and I quote, \u2018solve the problem of free movement of goods in the context of the free trade agreement \u2026 that we\u2019ll negotiate in the implementation period\u2019. Mr Speaker, can the prime minister confirm that if there is no deal there will not be an implementation period? It is deeply worrying that those who seek to lead this country have no grip on reality. The prime minister said the council reiterated its wish to avoid a \u2018disorderly Brexit\u2019. I\u2019m not sure they will have been reassured by the statements of her potential successors. Labour put forward a plan that could bring this country back together, but the prime minister refused to compromise. Whoever the next prime minister is, they will barely hold the support of this House, so they certainly have no mandate to force a disastrous hard-right Brexit on this country. And I make it clear that Labour will work across the House to block no deal. But whatever Brexit plan the new Tory leader comes up with, after three long years of failure, they should have the confidence to go back to the people on a deal agreed by parliament. May is responding to Corbyn. She says he asked about Brexit and the Tory leadership election, which were subjects that did not come up at the EU summit. But she says no deal is \u201cthe default option\u201d. She says she wanted to leave the EU on 29 March. If Labour had voted for it, \u201cwe would already be out.\u201d She says she had voted for a deal three times, while Corbyn had voted against the deal, increasing the chance of no deal. She says the Tories are not divorced from reality; the person most divorced from reality is Corbyn himself, who wants to follow the Venezuelan economic model, she claims. Corbyn asks May if she agrees with Boris Johnson that it would be possible to negotiate a solution to the backstop during the transition. He says Labour will work with other MPs to block no deal. And he ends by saying the government should let the public decide on Brexit. Whatever Brexit plan the new Tory leader comes up with, after three long years of failure they should have the confidence to go back to the people on a deal agreed by parliament. Turning to Brexit, Corbyn says there have been three wasted years since the vote to leave the EU. And we will soon be on our third prime minister, he says. He says Theresa May wasted time appealing to the wilder extremes in her party, instead of reaching out across the Commons. Does she accept it was a mistake to legitimise the idea of no deal? Does May believe no deal should be on the table as a viable option? What would be worse? Crashing out in October? Or putting it back to the people for a final say? Corbyn implies a second referendum would be preferable to a no-deal Brexit. He asks May to confirm the UK would not be ready to crash out in October. Back in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn is responding to Theresa May. He starts by saying it is 10 years since John Bercow became Speaker. \u201cCongratulations on the first 10 years,\u201d he says. He also sends his best wishes to John Prescott. And then he turns to Iran. Last week the world was only minutes away from a US-Iran war, he says. He says the Iran nuclear deal should be defended. Turning back to migration for a moment, Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury who currently seems to be spending much of her time acting as Boris Johnson\u2019s chief media spokesperson, has warmly welcomed Sajid Javid\u2019s decision to review income thresholds for immigrants after Brexit. Theresa May starts by wishing John Prescott a full recovery. She says the EU summit focused on climate change, disinformation, the EU\u2019s external relations, and what the EU calls its \u201ctop jobs\u201d. She says she was there because the UK has agreed to continue contributing fully to EU discussions while it remains a member. Theresa May is about to make a Commons statement on last week\u2019s EU summit. She may get quite a lot of questions about Brexit but, unless she decides to comment on the Brexit plans being floated by her two potential successors (which seems unlikely), it is hard to see what she might say that will qualify as news. Here are two questions from below the line on a topic that is the subject of much chatter at Westminster at the moment \u2013 how the timing of a no-confidence vote might interact with the article 50 process. It is not easy to answer these questions, because the article 50 process is unprecedented \u2013 no other country has every used article 50 to leave the EU \u2013 and the UK has never seen a no-confidence vote lead to a general election under the procedure set out in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. But it is possible that a no-confidence vote in September, followed by a 14-day wait to see if a new government could win a vote of confidence, followed by the calling of an election, which would have to take place 25 working days after the dissolution of parliament, would leave little or no time for the UK to request an article 50 extension before the 31 October deadline. There is no provision for parliament to request an article 50 extension. The request to the EU would have to come from the PM. A responsible PM might make such a request in the event of a pending general election, to keep options for whoever won, but if Boris Johnson were in this position in September, he would probably argue that he was elected party leader and prime minister on a mandate to deliver Brexit by 31 October come what may. I\u2019m afraid the monarch has not had the power to sack the prime minister, and appoint another one, for at least a century, and probably longer. And she does not have the power to request an article 50 extension, even if she wanted one. Labour is to examine the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency, the shadow chancellor John McDonnell said this morning. As my colleague Philip Inman reports, a review into City practices and how investments can be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions will report by October as part of the party\u2019s support for policies tied to the green industrial revolution. Speaking to City executives in central London, McDonnell said he also wanted the Bank of England to help monitor the City\u2019s progress towards lower carbon emissions. This new responsibility would be on top of Labour\u2019s plan to make the central bank also adopt policies that will boost the productivity of British firms. Theresa May still has a month left to serve as prime minister, but already her policy agenda is being shredded. A relative hardliner in Tory terms on immigration, she pushed hard for a high salary threshold for skilled workers coming to the UK after Brexit and, when the government\u2019s white paper on immigration was published in December, it proposed a rule saying migrants would have to be earning \u00a330,000 a year to qualify as a skilled worker for a five-year visa. As a concession to the Treasury and the business department, which wanted a more open regime, it was agreed that this threshold would be subject to consultation. Sajid Javid, the home secretary, has now published details of that consultation \u2013 and his announcement strongly applies that the salary thresholds in the white paper are going to be abandoned. He is also floating the idea of having different salary thresholds for different areas of the country. This is from the Home Office news release. The home secretary Sajid Javid has today asked the migration advisory committee to review and advise on salary thresholds for the future immigration system, which will start to take effect from 2021. The migration advisory committee previously recommended that we should retain the existing minimum salary thresholds in the future immigration system, which includes paying experienced workers at least \u00a330,000, and new entrants (including recent graduates) at least \u00a320,800. The home secretary has asked the migration advisory committee to consider how future salary thresholds should be calculated, the levels of salary thresholds, whether there is a case for regional salary thresholds for different parts of the UK, and whether there should be exceptions to salary thresholds, for example because they\u2019ve newly started the occupation or because they work in an occupation in shortage. A final decision would be taken by the next Tory MP (assuming the Conservatives stay in power). But Javid will be making this announcement knowing that both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are much more relaxed about immigration than May. Variable salary thresholds for different parts of the UK would be a policy with particular significance for Scotland, which is much more dependent on immigration than other parts of the UK. The SNP-led Scottish government has for years been saying it should have control over immigration policy in Scotland. At an event last week Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, said that getting more power over immigration would be her top demand in terms of extending devolution. She also revealed that, at the recent D-day commemoration event, Johnson was joking with her about what might be needed to \u201cbuy you guys off\u201d (ie to quash the demand for independence). Jeremy Hunt has stepped up his criticism of Boris Johnson for avoiding media scrutiny in the Tory leadership campaign, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, as another minister said Johnson could be brought down by his own MPs if he pushed for a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to face public scrutiny as he runs for the Conservative party leadership has prompted Sky News to cancel a televised debate this week. John Griffin, one of the Conservative party\u2019s most generous donors, has joined a growing chorus of demands for Boris Johnson to explain why police were called to his home after an altercation with his partner. The People\u2019s Vote campaign has criticised plans published by the Alternative Arrangements Commission for an alternative to the backstop as unworkable. In a statement responding to the report (see 12.27pm) issued by People\u2019s Vote, the Labour MP Owen Smith said: The idea of trying to replace the Northern Ireland backstop with so-called \u2018alternative arrangements\u2019 has already been tested to destruction. There is no political will to do so from either Ireland, the rest of the EU or most importantly the people of Northern Ireland, particularly those living on or near the border. This new report does nothing to address that crucial underlying point. Talk of vague \u2018technological solutions\u2019, special economic zones or checks away from the border still fail to meet the basic test for a durable solution to this intractable problem. It needs to have the consent of both the people of Northern Ireland and of the Republic of Ireland \u2013 those who it will affect the most. And it\u2019s clear it doesn\u2019t have that consent on either side of the border. The Alternative Arrangements Commission is nothing more or less than a desperate attempt to make a square peg fit into a round hole in order to try and hold the warring factions of the Conservative party together. The future of Northern Ireland is too important to be treated like this. The only way to a deliver a lasting and stable solution to this problem is to give the public the final say. The Brexit party is to launch a formal legal challenge against the result of this month\u2019s Peterborough byelection, where it was narrowly beaten by Labour, claiming that allegations of corruption connected to postal votes need to be investigated. Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, has put forward the prospect of a coalition with the Conservative party to ensure the UK leaves the EU without a deal, and offered Johnson his support following his row with his partner. Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s head of communications, has dismissed allegations that misuse of the social network influenced the EU referendum result. The former deputy prime minister John Prescott has been admitted to hospital after having a stroke, prompting messages of support from current and former Labour leaders. This is from Jeremy Corbyn. Ken Clarke, the Tory pro-European, has reaffirmed his willingness to vote against the government in a no-confidence debate to stop a no-deal Brexit. Asked about this possible scenario on The World at One, he said: It depends on the circumstances at the time and what whoever is prime minister is putting forward as the policy he is going to pursue. But I am not going to vote in favour of a government that says it is going to pursue policies which are totally incompatible with everything the Conservative party has stood for under all those prime ministers for the decades that I have been in parliament. Here is a source from the Jeremy Hunt camp responding to the news that Sky has cancelled the leaders\u2019 debate planned for tomorrow because Boris Johnson has refused to attend. (See 11.07am.) The source said: Bottler Boris and his complacent campaign have shown they can\u2019t trust their candidate to turn up and perform. David Henig, the former civil servant who now heads the UK Trade Policy Project, has written a Twitter thread with a good commentary on the Alternative Arrangements Commission conference. (See 12.27pm and 12.35pm.) It starts here. Today\u2019s Evening Standard, which is backing Boris Johnson for the Conservative party leadership, is splashing on a story based on a picture apparently showing Johnson making up with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. My colleague Owen Jones thinks that, in the light of the way the Johnsonites have been complaining about \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d and the like (see 10.35am), this is an example of hypocrisy. These are from my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll, who has been attending the Alternative Arrangements Commission conference this morning. Shanker Singham is a member of the commission, and a pro-Brexit trade expert. As my colleague Lisa O\u2019Carroll reports, the Alternative Arrangements Commission, which was set up to look at ways of managing the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland after Brexit to avoid the need for the backstop (which would effectively keep the UK in the customs union), has published an interim report today. There is a 35-page summary here (pdf), and the full 203-page interim report is here (pdf). On the Today programme this morning Greg Hands, the former international trade minister and one of the co-chairs of the commission, said the ideas in the report were a viable alternative to the backstop. He said he thought it would be possible to negotiate this with the EU before 31 October, although he said it would take up to two to three years to introduce these alternative arrangements. He went on: We think it is possible to have this. We will be publishing next month an alternative arrangements protocol that could be inserted either into the withdrawal agreement or into any new form of Brexit that might be negotiated by the next UK prime minister. Hands accepted that, for traders in Ireland, his plans would not amount to \u201cno change\u201d from the status quo. But the proposals would avoid a hard border, he said. The Brexit party is to launch a formal legal challenge against the result of this month\u2019s Peterborough byelection, where it was narrowly beaten by Labour, alleging that allegations of corruption connected to postal votes need to be investigated. Nigel Farage, the party leader, insisted the challenge was about more than the loss to Labour by 683 votes, saying the wider use of postal votes was open to abuse and needed to be investigated. Speaking at a press conference in London, he said: I know people will say, \u2018Oh, but it\u2019s sour grapes.\u2019 It isn\u2019t. Actually, as far as I\u2019m concerned, this is about a lot more than Peterborough. It is about a system that is wide open to corruption, to intimidation, to bribery, to abuse on a whole number of levels. I have mentioned this a number of times in the past. The party plans to issue a petition under the 1983 Representation of the People Act, which allows election results to be challenged retrospectively for reasons including errors or corruption connected to the polling. Such challenges are rare, with the last successful one coming in 2010, when the Labour minister Phil Woolas was ejected from his Oldham East and Saddleworth constituency after a specially convened election court upheld a complaint that Woolas had knowingly lied about his Lib Dem opponent. One of the Conservative party\u2019s most generous donors has joined a growing chorus of demands for Boris Johnson to explain why police were called to his home after an altercation with his partner. As my colleague Rajeev Syal reports, John Griffin, the taxi tycoon who has given \u00a34m to the Tories over the last six years, has expressed concerns about the morality of the favourite to become prime minister and called on him to explain the circumstances of a furious row with his partner, Carrie Symonds. Boris Johnson has not generally been giving interviews since the Tory leadership contest formally started two weeks ago but a large number of his supporters have been touring the broadcast studios speaking on his behalf, with varying degrees of effectiveness. One has been the Tory Brexiter Marcus Fysh. Speaking on the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire show, Fysh said it was \u201cridiculous\u201d for Jeremy Hunt to call Johnson a coward for avoiding TV debates. (See 9.18am.) Fysh said: [Johnson] is certainly not a coward, as was said by his opponent today in a very negative way. That\u2019s a ridiculous assertion to make. In the interview, which was broadcast before Sky News announced it intended to cancel tomorrow\u2019s debate (see 11.07am), Fysh also said \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d when asked if he thought Johnson should take part in the event. But he said he did not think Johnson needed to attend because he would be taking part in hustings \u201cpretty much every day\u201d for the next month. John Prescott, who was deputy prime minister for 10 years during Tony Blair\u2019s Labour government, is recovering from a stroke, his family have said in a statement. Jeremy Corbyn was due to be meeting union leaders this morning, ahead of a shadow cabinet meeting tomorrow where Labour will decide whether to firm up its support for a second referendum and remain. Corbyn has already said that the party would put any Brexit deal to a second referendum, but he has not committed Labour to backing remain, or committed the party to making remain a general election pledge. Ahead of today\u2019s meeting, the People\u2019s Vote campaign has released a poll from YouGov of almost 2,000 trade unionists showing that, by a wide margin, they want a second referendum and want Labour to campaign for remain. Here are some of the findings. The polls show that rank-and-file trade union members: Support staying in the EU by a margin of 71 to 29% if there is a new referendum. Back having a people\u2019s vote by 64 to 33%. Support for such a final say referendum rises to 78% with just 17% opposed among trade unionists who voted Labour in the last general election. Want Labour to campaign for the UK to stay in the EU by a three-to-one margin of 60 to 21% \u2013 rising to 74 to 10% among the party\u2019s 2017 voters. Commenting on the results, the Labour MP Jo Stevens, secretary of the trade union group of Labour MPs and a People\u2019s Vote supporter, said: Labour\u2019s official position is still too far behind that of our party members and voters, not to mention grassroots trade unionists who are the bedrock of our movement. When Jeremy Corbyn meets with trade union general secretaries, I hope he hears the strong message from working people, trade union members up and down the country, that we want a people\u2019s vote just like his constituents do in Islington \u2013 because now, more than ever, we need those voices to be heard. I\u2019m back in the office. And good news \u2013 the Palace of Westminster is not burning down. The fire alarm was a test. Earlier I said that Sky News was planning a TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt tomorrow, but that Johnson was refusing to take part. (See 9.18am.) But Sky News has now said it will cancel tomorrow\u2019s event if Johnson refuses to participate and will challenge him instead to attend a debate a week today. In his LBC phone-in this morning, Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter, strongly criticised the neighbours who recorded Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds having a furious row in her flat and who contacted the police because of their concerns, before alerting the Guardian. Rees-Mogg dismissed them as \u201cCorbynista curtain-twitchers\u201d. Asked about the incident, he said: I think it\u2019s absolutely dreadful. I think the idea that snooping neighbours are recording what is going on for political advantage and then Class War protesters are coming to politicians\u2019 front doors \u2013 which happened to me as well \u2013 is not a good place for politics to be. I think politicians should feel safe and unmolested in their homes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an unreasonable thing to ask for ... And snoopers are always unattractive. Corbynista curtain-twitchers are not attractive. (I\u2019ve got to leave the office for a while because the fire alarm is going off, in what seems to be a regular Monday morning test. Hopefully I\u2019ll be back in about 20 minutes.) Sir Nicholas Soames, the Conservative former minister, has been tweeting critically about Boris Johnson this morning. But Nadine Dorries, a strong Johnson supporter, has been tweeting a message of support. Here is an extract from Boris Johnson\u2019s Telegraph column today (paywall) where he reasserts his determination to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He says: We are just over four months away from the date on which, by law, we must leave the EU; and this time we are not going to bottle it. We are not going to fail. This time we are not going to shrink in fear from the exit, as we have on the last two occasions. We are going to show all the mettle, the creativity and the energy of this amazing nation. We are going to focus all our efforts on honouring that single great promise \u2013 and we are going to come out of the EU on October 31. Presumably this is not one of those Johnson columns that the Telegraph would describe as \u201cclearly comically polemical\u201d and something that \u201ccould not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters\u201d, which was the Telegraph response to the Independent Press Standards Organisation when a reader complained about Johnson making a false claim about Brexit public opinion in one of his columns earlier this year. In his regular Daily Telegraph column this morning Boris Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, reaffirms his commitment (seen as wobby by some) to deliver Brexit by 31 October in all circumstances. He declares four times that the UK will leave the EU by that date. But this morning we\u2019ve heard fresh evidence as to why Johnson could find delivering a no-deal Brexit by 31 October impossible. We have already heard the Tory MPs Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke say they would vote against a Conservative government in a no-confidence debate to stop no deal, and MPs like Philip Hammond and Rory Stewart have hinted they might do the same. In an interview for the BBC, Tobias Ellwood, a defence minister, has said that in total about a dozen Tories would be willing to back a no-confidence motion in these circumstances. The government currently has a working majority, with the DUP, of around four, and so 12 Tories could easily bring down the new PM. Asked about Tory MPs supporting the \u201cnuclear option\u201d, denying the government Commons support to prevent no-deal, Ellwood said: I believe that absolutely is the case. I think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no-deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers. Jeremy Hunt, Johnson\u2019s rival for the Conservative leadership, has been citing this as one reason why a Johnson administration could quickly collapse. Hunt has been doing a round of interviews this morning and he told ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain: [Johnson] is going to come to power on a very fragile coalition of people like Matt Hancock who wants no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois who wants no deal. Sometimes in politics you can fudge and get away with it but in the case of Brexit you are going to have to make decisions immediately, and that very fragile coalition will collapse immediately when you have to make those decisions. If that happens we won\u2019t have another leadership contest, we will have Jeremy Corbyn in No 10 and there won\u2019t be any Brexit at all. Hunt also argued that this was why Johnson needed to stop dodging media scrutiny and agree to more TV debates, like the one planned by Sky tomorrow night (which Johnson is boycotting). In an article in the Times (paywall) this morning Hunt said Johnson was being a coward. He said: Boris has done just one interview on Today in the past year. I have done 16. He has not appeared on The Andrew Marr Show this year and his one broadcast interview of this campaign, with World at One, was arranged with just 10 minutes\u2019 notice so Mark Mardell had no time to prepare questions. And now he is refusing point blank to do TV debates. Pathetically, within hours of getting through to the final two he \u201cchallenged\u201d me to the ITV debate. I willingly accepted even though it was scheduled for three weeks later, after most members have received their postal votes and after many of them will have voted ... The first debate that Boris has been invited to will be on Sky News tomorrow evening. I\u2019ll be there. So don\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up and show the nation you can cope with the intense scrutiny the most difficult job in the country will involve. Here is the agenda for the day. 9am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Tory Brexiter and chair of the European Research Group, holds an LBC phone-in. 9.35am: Steve Barclay, the Brexit secretary, speaks at a conference where an interim report from the Alternative Arrangements Commission, which is looking at alternatives to the backstop, is being published. 10.30am: Nigel Farage, the Brexit party leader, holds a press conference on postal votes. 11am: John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, gives a speech on the economy and Labour\u2019s plans for sustainable investment. 11.20am: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, gives a speech to the Law Society of Edinburgh. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime, and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

Mahmudullah picks out point for one, Mushfiqur adds one more, then Mahmudullah totally misjudges its final delivery, which grips and bounces, then misses the edge. On the one hand, that\u2019s good for Afghanistan; on the other, they\u2019ve got to bat in a bit. There\u2019ve been only four boundaries in the innings, and perhaps that\u2019s how to go about the chase: chuck the bat during the powerplay. </p> <p>\u201cI remember in the famous 1982-83 Ashes Test in Melbourne,\u201d says Rocket, \u201clate on the fourth day when England were trying to get Allan Border off strike and bowl to Jeff Thomson - Border hit the last ball of an over hard towards the western square boundary (where we were sitting) and the batsmen were running three. David Gower was running alongside the ball, hoping it would go into the boundary. From memory I think it just did, but we thought he was about to help it on it\u2019s way. We knew that rule, and Australia would have got seven runs rather than four.

Many of the matches in this World Cup so far as well as most of the 2018 Test season has proved this notion of bowlers coming out on top more often than not in duels against batters.

Currently, he is the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer \u2013 with a higher strike-rate than both David Warner and Joe Root, who lie first and third \u2013 while his bowling is threatening, his leadership absolute and his mentality unflappable.

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s it from me. Stick around for all the match report and reaction, but from me, cheerio! A quick word from Gulbadin Naib: \u201cWe missed something in the fielding. But credit to Shakib, he bowled really well.\u201d And here\u2019s Mashrafe Mortaza: \u201cShakib has been fantastic, phenomenal.\u201d Fair to say that result has added to the pressure on England. Bangladesh sit just a point behind the hosts now, though Eoin Morgan\u2019s side have a game in hand. Bangladesh have India and Pakistan still to play; England face Australia, New Zealand and India \u2013 the three teams above them in the table. Here\u2019s Shakib, the man of the match: \u201cIt was a terrific team effort,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo more important matches coming up against India and Pakistan \u2013 we\u2019ll have to play to the best of our abilities.\u201d Not much of a contest in truth, with Bangladesh only briefly under any kind of pressure. Bangladesh have a long wait until they face India but they\u2019ll go into that game a) fancying their chances and b) hoping two wins can take them into the semis. NOOOOO! Shinwari is left stranded on 49 as his young colleague backs away to leg and swings wildly. And, it turns out, inaccurately. 47th over: Afghanistan 200-9 (Shinwari 49, Mujeeb 0) Shinwari still has his half-century and a 200 for Afghanistan to fight for. A hammering drive straight back past Shaifuddin brings both closer. Then a top edge drops \u2026 safe to bring up the 200. He moves to 49 and faces a nervous wait as Mujeeb takes strike for the final two balls. First ball blocked. Second ball \u2026 46th over: Afghanistan 195-9 (Shinwari 43, Mujeeb 0) The 18-year-old Mujeeb Ur Rahman is last man for Afghanistan. The last ball of the over bounces a whisker over the bails as the No 11 backs away to leg. Just one run from the over. Mustafizur continues as Bangladesh look to wrap this up. And we move a step closer \u2013 the faintest of faint edges through to the keeper from the Afghanistan No 10. 45th over: Afghanistan 194-8 (Shinwari 43, Dawlat 0) Shinwari scuttles for two off Shakib\u2019s first ball of his final over. And there\u2019s a single a ball or two later. Dawlat opts just to see it out. And there\u2019s a huge ovation at the end of the over \u2013 that\u2019s the end of Shakib\u2019s work today: 10-1-29-5. 44th over: Afghanistan 191-8 (Shinwari 40, Dawlat 0) Play-and-miss first up from Dawlat and Afghanistan are going to fall well short once again. Rashid Khan can\u2019t get hold of Mustafizur short ball and instead plonks it straight into the hands of the Bangladesh captain at midwicket. 43rd over: Afghanistan 189-7 (Shinwari 36, Rashid 1) Rashid Khan looked as organised as any Afghanistan batsman when I saw them at Cardiff against South Africa the other weekend. But, as was the case back then, the top order has left too much to do. Got him! Najibullah goes for a big hit against Shakib, can connect with only fresh Hampshire air and Mushfiqur does the required behind the stumps. Five-fer for Shakib, to go with his fifty earlier on. Not a bad day\u2019s work. 42nd over: Afghanistan 184-6 (Shinwari 36, Najibullah 22) There may just be a few heart-rates creeping up among the Bangladeshi players and supporters. They could do with a wicket just to snuff out this little uprising. This pair bring up a 50 partnership from 41 balls thanks to some well-placed shots and some hard running. Seven from the Shaifuddin over. 41st over: Afghanistan 177-6 (Shinwari 34, Najibullah 17) Shakib (7-1-10-4) returns. And those figures lose their edge. Najibullah scampers two from the first, then chips down the ground for a single. And from the last Shinwari smashes a six over long off. 40th over: Afghanistan 166-6 (Shinwari 27, Najibullah 13) Two singles from the first two balls of Shaifuddin\u2019s latest over, the second coming off a daft overthrow. And, a few balls later, he sends down a hideous leg-side wide. This pair are giving Afghanistan a glimmer \u2013 a teeny, tiny glimmer \u2013 of hope. 39th over: Afghanistan 160-6 (Shinwari 24, Najibullah 11) Shinwari cuts through backward point for four! Fine shot but Mustafizur has him playing and missing outside off a couple of balls later. Six off the over. The Required Rate sidles past Nine and begins to wander in the vague direction of Ten. 38th over: Afghanistan 154-6 (Shinwari 19, Najibullah 10) Najibullah, looking to be assertive, drives Mosaddek sweetly through the covers for four to bring up the Afghanistan 150 then scampers a single. 109 required from 72 balls. 37th over: Afghanistan 147-6 (Shinwari 17, Najibullah 5) Mustafizuq struggles a bit for line here, spraying either side of the wicket. The batsmen work him around for six. 36th over: Afghanistan 141-6 (Shinwari 13, Najibullah 4) Actually I\u2019m being a bit harsh on Shinwari there \u2013 Ikram had only himself to blame really. Najibullah thumps his first ball over the top for four, and Shinwari sweeps for four too. It\u2019s a bit too little too late surely. Two appeals the first ball after the drinks break. Mehidy yelps for an lbw decision \u2013 not given \u2013 but it matters not because Ikram is run out by a direct hit at the non-striker\u2019s end. Shinwari hasn\u2019t run himself out but he\u2019s helped scupper his young batting partner there. 35th over: Afghanistan 132-5 (Shinwari 8, Ikram 11) Mustafizur returns. Nudge, nurdle and, from the last, nick! But there\u2019s no one at slip so Ikram picks up a welcome boundary. And that\u2019s drinks. 34th over: Afghanistan 125-5 (Shinwari 7, Ikram 6) Mortaza once more. Ikram nudges to deep backward square leg for two and he\u2019s unlucky to spank a cut straight at the man at point. He\u2019s looked more comfortable out there than any of his teammates thus far. And he nabs the strike off the last too. 33rd over: Afghanistan 119-5 (Shinwari 6, Ikram 1) Ikram Ali Khil is next up. Shakib\u2019s figures just keep getting better: 7-1-10-4 now. Shakib has another! Afghan finally looks to break the shackles but can only pick out the man on the midwicket boundary. 32nd over: Afghanistan 117-4 (Shinwari 5, Afghan 20) Mortaza brings himself back into the attack. Afghan misses out on a wide half-volley. The Required Run Rate wanders past Eight and purposefully strides in the direction of Nine. 31st over: Afghanistan 113-4 (Shinwari 4, Afghan 17) Shinwari seems determined to run himself out, charging down the pitch pretty much every time he hits the ball before angry words from his partner send him back. Just a couple of singles from Shakib\u2019s latest. 30th over: Afghanistan 111-4 (Shinwari 3, Afghan 16) That over has woken the crowd up \u2013 they were just beginning to snooze but the party atmosphere has returned. Four off Shaifuddin\u2019s latest with a wild waft from Shinwari to finish things off. 29th over: Afghanistan 106-4 (Shinwari 2, Afghan 13) Shakib now has spectacular figures of 5-1-6-3. What a player. It\u2019s a bit early to say that\u2019s that but it\u2019s a really tall order for Afghanistan now. Mohammad Nabi, the main reason they got as close as they did against India, is the new man. And he\u2019s gone, second ball! Shakib sneaks one between bat and pad and that really could be that. Gulbadin goes at last! He cover-drives Shakib\u2019s first of a fresh over \u2013 not uppishly but there\u2019s a man in at short cover to pouch a low catch. 28th over: Afghanistan 104-2 (Gulbadin 47, Afghan 13) Gulbadin heaves for one and looks frustrated to find himself stuck at the non-striker\u2019s end as Shaifuddin continues to rumble in. Afghan this time manages to find a single, though. Gulbadin celebrates with another awkward heave for a single. There\u2019s no lack of intent but he\u2019s still struggling to time the ball out there. 27th over: Afghanistan 101-2 (Gulbadin 45, Afghan 12) A silly point comes in \u2013 I think it\u2019s Liton Das under the lid. Afghan responds by blocking, blocking and blocking again. A fine over from Shakib \u2013 just one from it. The Required Run Rate waves merrily at Seven as it passes by and strides confidently off towards Eight. 26th over: Afghanistan 101-2 (Gulbadin 45, Afghan 12) A bit of pace for a change \u2013 Shaifuddin returns to the attack. A punch down the ground (one that the bowler deflects worryingly close to umpire Gough\u2019s armpit) brings up the Afghanistan 100. Three from the over. 25th over: Afghanistan 98-2 (Gulbadin 44, Afghan 10) Shakib (2-0-2-1) returns. Two from the over, the second coming off another bit of hesitant running, Afghan imploring his captain to stop, stop, STOPPPPP! as he comes roaring down the wicket. And then scrambling through for one. 24th over: Afghanistan 96-2 (Gulbadin 43, Afghan 9) Mehidy continues into his seventh over. Asghar Afghan sweeps hard for four \u2013 lovely shot. I think I\u2019m right in saying that\u2019s the first boundary Mehidy has conceded in this innings. 23rd over: Afghanistan 87-2 (Gulbadin 41, Afghan 1) Gulbadin tries his best to get things moving, lofting Mosaddek over the covers for four, but the required rate has crept past Six and is striding confidently towards Seven, with a song in its heart and a whistle on its lips. 22nd over: Afghanistan 81-2 (Gulbadin 36, Afghan 1) \u201cAs much as we\u2019d like an Afghan win, this will go the way of the India game,\u201d reckons Kevin Wilson. \u201cThey just can\u2019t scratch around not losing wickets. Getting a run a ball or more over 30 overs just isn\u2019t going to happen.\u201d Yes, that does feel the way it\u2019s going. The weak link before the tournament seemed to be their batting and that\u2019s how it\u2019s played out. They just don\u2019t have a batsman who strikes any fear into the opposition. The whole lineup feels containable. Mehidy rattles through another one \u2013 6-0-19-0. 21st over: Afghanistan 79-2 (Gulbadin 35, Afghan 0) A fine bit of bowling from Mosaddek that. Advantage Bangladesh you sense. Mosaddek continues. And finally somethings happens \u2013 a push into the off, a misfield, and a farcical bit of running that at one point sees both batsmen stood stock still in the middle of the pitch, watching as the fielder prepares to pick up the ball and shy at the stumps. Hashmatullah just manages to scramble back \u2026 and there\u2019s no run. But two balls later he\u2019s gone! A lovely bit of bowling sees Mosaddek sneak the ball past Hashmat\u2019s heave to leg and, with his back foot sliding out of the crease, Mushfiqur does the necessary. 20th over: Afghanistan 77-1 (Gulbadin 34, Hashmatullah 10) Mehidy continues into his fifth over. Single, single, single, single, dot, dot. Even the thus-far boisterous Hampshire Bowl crowd has been lulled into a bit of a stupor. 19th over: Afghanistan 73-1 (Gulbadin 32, Hashmatullah 8) Mosaddek concedes just one from his latest. We\u2019ve not had a sniff of a wicket since Rahmat went and we\u2019ve had only one boundary since the ninth over. It\u2019s a war of attrition at the moment. 18th over: Afghanistan 72-1 (Gulbadin 31, Hashmatullah 8) Hashmatullah unfurls the sweep once more, finally discomfiting the otherwise unpeturbed Mehidy. The batsmen have looked a little more sure of themselves, a little more assertive, since the drinks break. 17th over: Afghanistan 65-1 (Gulbadin 27, Hashmatullah 5) Gulbadin needs some attention from the old magic sponge during the drinks break. He seems OK though. Mosaddek finds Hashmatullah\u2019s outside edge on the resumption but there\u2019s no slip so the batsman picks up a couple. 16th over: Afghanistan 60-1 (Gulbadin 25, Hashmatullah 2) Mehidy is enjoying bowling on this pitch. Hashmatullah, Afghanistan\u2019s leading runscorer in the tournament so far, sees out three dots then sweeps hard for a single. He goes to two from 14 balls. Mehidy\u2019s figures read 3-0-6-0 after that one. 15th over: Afghanistan 58-1 (Gulbadin 24, Hashmatullah 1) Mosaddek, fresh from a cracking little cameo at the end of the Bangladesh innings, comes into the attack, with Mortaza perhaps sensing he can sneak through a few overs cheaply while these batsmen are becalmed. And becalmed they are \u2013 Gulbadin, who should really have his eye in now, sees off five scratchy dots. At least from the last he launches over the top of mid off for a pressure-relieving four. 14th over: Afghanistan 54-1 (Gulbadin 20, Hashmatullah 1) Hashmatullah finally gets off the mark with a dangerous single to mid on \u2013 Gulbadin was none-too-sure about that one but his partner screamed him through regardless. A jaffer from Mehidy to end the over \u2013 ripping and turning joyfully past the outside edge of Hashmat\u2019s bat. 13th over: Afghanistan 51-1 (Gulbadin 18, Hashmatullah 0) And it\u2019s more of the same from Shakib. Hashmatullah in particular is looking a little uncertain \u2013 he\u2019s faced eight balls and is yet to get the ball off the square never mind get himself off the mark. 12th over: Afghanistan 50-1 (Gulbadin 17, Hashmatullah 0) Mehidy form the other end as Bangladesh opt for a double dose of spin. A nudge for one brings up the 50 but it\u2019s a tight and testing over from Mehidy. 11th over: Afghanistan 49-1 (Gulbadin 16, Hashmatullah 0) Ugh, that was rather ugly from Rahmat, and so unnecessary. Spin for the first time courtesy of the world No 1 all-rounder and leading run-scorer in the tournament Shakib Al Hasan. And it produces the breakthrough \u2013 a few dots crank up the pressure then Rahmat tries to smear the ball into the stands, mistimes, and Tamim takes a simple catch. 10th over: Afghanistan 48-0 (Gulbadin 15, Rahmat 24) Shaifuddin once more and once more he\u2019s nice and accurate. Just three off the over. This - Captain Obvious alert \u2013 has been a really solid start from Afghanistan. 9th over: Afghanistan 45-0 (Gulbadin 12, Rahmat 24) Mortaza\u2019s turn to drop short and Rahmat pulls hard for four down to backward square leg but the bowler strikes back with one that just holds its line outside off, flashing past outside edge and stumps. Gulbadin clubs over the top of mid on \u2013 mistiming it a touch \u2013 for three, then Rahmat carves sweetly through point for four more! That\u2019s a very profitable over for Afghanistan \u2013 12 from it. 8th over: Afghanistan 33-0 (Gulbadin 9, Rahmat 15) Shaifuddin enters the attack, with Afghanistan perhaps just a little bit too comfortable for Mortaza\u2019s comfort. A single each for the batsmen. 7th over: Afghanistan 31-0 (Gulbadin 8, Rahmat 14) Rahmat shovels Mortaza into the leg side for a couple, then \u2013 hello! \u2013 skips down the wicket and attempts to find the stands at cow corner. He succeeds only in chipping the ball about two-thirds of the way to the rope, which says a bit about the awkward nature of this pitch. 6th over: Afghanistan 27-0 (Gulbadin 8, Rahmat 10) The Fiz beats Gulbadin all ends up with a little leg cutter that zips past the outside edge. The Afghanistan captain gratefully scampers a single from the next. Gulbadin gets his revenge later in the over though, clubbing Mustafizur back down the ground for four. 5th over: Afghanistan 21-0 (Gulbadin 3, Rahmat 9) Mortaza keeps things tight. And that\u2019s about all there is to say about that. 4th over: Afghanistan 20-0 (Gulbadin 2, Rahmat 9) Mustafizur drops short for the first time and the ball just sits up screaming \u201cHit me! Hit me!\u201d at the top of its little lungs. Rahmat obliges pulling majestically down to cow corner for four. Five from the over all told. 3rd over: Afghanistan 15-0 (Gulbadin 2, Rahmat 5) Mortaza wangs down another leg-side wide and his radar seems a little off. Six off the over in ones and twos. 2nd over: Afghanistan 8-0 (Gulbadin 0, Rahmat 2) Mustafizur at the other end. He loses his line, drifting onto Gulbadin\u2019s pads and four leg byes are the result. They\u2019re the only runs from the over, though. If Gulbadin brought himself up the order to pinch hit \u2026 well, he\u2019s not off the mark yet having faced eight balls. 1st over: Afghanistan 4-0 (Gulbadin 0, Rahmat 2) Mashrafe Mortaza starts things off for Bangladesh and a little leg bye gets Afghanistan off the mark. Rahmat clips to leg for the first runs off the bat, there\u2019s a wide and it\u2019s four off the over all told. You feel Afghanistan have got to get their collective foot on the accelerator early doors here but there was no sign there of any out-of-the-ordinary aggression. Out stride the openers: Gulbadin Naib, the captain promoting himself up the order, and Rahmat Shah. Hello everyone. I can only echo Dan\u2019s sentiments \u2013 this looks to be a few too many for Afghanistan on a tricky pitch. Their scores so far at this tournament have been short of their target today \u2013 207, 152, 172, 125, 247-8 and 213. Anyhow, thanks all for your company and comments - John Ashdown will be here presently to coax you through the chase. In the meantime, here\u2019s something to read. Afghanistan bowled pretty well but let themselves down with their fielding, and probably lack the firepower to chase a decent total on a difficult pitch and slow outfield. If they\u2019re going to get it, they probably need to go early, because once the fielders are back and the rate\u2019s up, they\u2019re in trouble. Which looks like 30 too many to me, but what do I know. A slower ball yorker, from the back of the hand, foxes Mosaddek, who\u2019s too slow on it, but what an innings that is - it might just have decided the game, pushing a competitive total just out of reach. 50th over: Bangladesh 262-6 (Mosaddek 35, Shaifuddin 2) Gulbadin brings himself back to finish off and Mossadek trusts his partner, excavating a yorker for a single. And, well, dearie me, Saifuddin edges a slower one, two men converge on a dolly, and Dawlat spills it. Afghanistan\u2019s fielding has been miserable today and they\u2019re punished for this error because a single brings Mossadek back on strike and he immediately clouts four. Two singles follow. 49th over: Bangladesh 254-6 (Mosaddek 28, Shaifuddin 0) Mossadek takes a single off the final ball of the over to retain strike; he\u2019ll be planning an onslaught, though I daresay his team think they\u2019ve enough already. Mushfiqur swings the bat at one, gets underneath part of it, and Nabi catches easily at cover. That\u2019s a brilliant innings, and on this pitch worth at least another 30. 49th over: Bangladesh 251-5 (Mushfiqur 83, Mosaddek 26) Mossadek is enjoying himself, cleansing an ugly full toss through cover, where Nabi dives over it like Bobby Mimms. 48th over: Bangladesh 246-5 (Mushfiqur 83, Mosaddek 21) Nice from Mushfiqur, who manufactures a reverse-sweep that flies just past the flying Hashmatullah at short third man. Then, after a single, Mossadek hits with the spin to earn four by way of cover - that\u2019s a lovely shot. Rashid, though, comes back well, conceding just one more - Mossadek curses himself for missing out, but it\u2019s not at all easy out there. Rashid finishes with 0-52, and has probably hit that point of his career where batsmen know what to expect so he needs to better at his variations, rather than find more of them. 47th over: Bangladesh 236-5 (Mushfiqur 78, Mosaddek 16) Zadran, who\u2019s not had such a good day, returns; Mosaddek smacks his first ball to the fence at long on. Zadran retorts with a yorker but follows that with a wide, after which Mosaddek clumps down the ground; Nabi does really well to skip over from long on and save the boundary. Two dots follow, then a one, and Bangladesh look like they\u2019re going to post something eminently chaseable. 46th over: Bangladesh 227-5 (Mushfiqur 77, Mosaddek 9) Bangladesh have mustered 27 from the last five overs; they\u2019ll be wanting more from these next five, and this one yields seven, without a boundary. That reflects well on the bowlers despite the outfield and track, and badly on the batsmen despite the outfield and track. \u201cElbow\u2019s Neat Little Rows has a (lengthy) vocal refrain of \u2018Ya da, ya da, ya da, ya da\u2019, says David Clifford. \u201cEvery time I hear it I just hear \u2018Yadav, Yadav, Yadav, Yadav.\u201d Incidentally, \u201cYadav\u201d means \u201chis hands\u201d in Hebrew, which is nice for a bowler, just as \u201cemess\u201d, as in MS Dhoni means \u201cultimate truth\u201d. 45th over: Bangladesh 220-5 (Mushfiqur 75, Mosaddek 4) Gulbadin wants this done so brings back Mujeeb; not bad naches for an 18-year-old. But he\u2019s taken for three twos and a one, leaving him with figures of 3-39 from his 10. That\u2019s an excellent job of work. 44th over: Bangladesh 212-5 (Mushfiqur 68, Mosaddek 3) On comes Rashid to target the new man, who gets off the mark with a three to fine third man. Mushfiqur takes a single either side, and he must be wondering if, as the senior batsman, he should be pushing the pace or making sure he stays in. Then, Rashid hits Mosaddek on the pad and asks the umpire if it was too high; the umpire tells him there\u2019s a way to find out, and he knows what that is. 43rd over: Bangladesh 207-5 (Mushfiqur 64, Mosaddek 0) \u201c\u201cAnother one involving Shikhar Dhawan,\u201d says Stephen Cottrell. \u201cFeeling Holy by the Charlatans has a lone \u2018shake it down, shake it down shake it down into which I always transpose the flamboyant Indian opener. Also, I quite like Ramesh Powar\u2019s name in the Yeah Yeah Yeah song by the Flaming Lips.\u201d The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song has got to be one of the worst song titles of all-time. Gulbadin sends down not so much a slower ball as a slowest ball and Mamudallah is through the shot almost before it\u2019s arrived, slapping to mid on where Nabi takes an easy catch. This has been a pretty nifty innings, given the injury. 42nd over: Bangladesh 203-4 (Mushfiqur 64, Mahmudullah 25) Nabi sends down three dots before Mahmudullah whacks to cover, where Gulbadin removes his hands from harm\u2019s way; they run two instead of one, raising the fifty partnership. A single follows, and I\u2019m surprised Bangladesh aren\u2019t going because they\u2019ve wickets in hand. 41st over: Bangladesh 200-4 (Mushfiqur 64, Mahmudullah 22) Gulbadin returns and Mahmudullah is into him right away, coming forward then somehow fashioning a square drive to the fence! That is an absolute jazzer! A single and a two follow and I daresay both sides will be ok with where we are, which tells us we could be in for a thriller. \u201cIn India,\u201d begins Abhijato Sensarma, \u201c\u2018Disco Dancer is a movie from the previous century which became an instant cult classic owing to its display of a dancer trying to live the big life. It\u2019s one of those movies from the past which will not win the award for the best movie in any year, but it\u2019s also one of those movies which you\u2019re always down to see on a free evening. I provide the link below to one of the songs from this enduring film. After hearing it, I can only hope that despite being released in the 20th century, the song must have been written with another player not playing today kept in mind - Mr Anderson!\u201d 40th over: Bangladesh 193-4 (Mushfiqur 62, Mahmudullah 17) Nabi returns and after a single to each batsman, Maumudullah eases back and crunches over the infield for four to cover. That was a lovely shot, and Bangladesh need more of them; if Afghanistan can limit them to, say, another 60, they\u2019ll fanxct they\u2019ve got a chance. \u201cBa Ba Ba, Babar Azam,\u201d croons Alex Crofts. \u201cHeard this one from a worse for wear England fan at Headingly when Pakistan were in the field a couple of years ago. Now it\u2019s on a loop in my head whenever I watch him...\u201d 39th over: Bangladesh 186-4 (Mushfiqur 61, Mahmudullah 11) Mahmudullah is putting himself through it, taking one to cover then two to midwicket; Shinwari shies wildly, not for the first time today, and yerman forces himself through for an overthrow. One more follows, then Mushfiqur slaps four to fine leg. 38th over: Bangladesh 177-4 (Mushfiqur 54, Mahmudullah 9) Mujeeb returns and, with three wickets so far, earns himself a slip. Four singles and a wide from the over and yerman is furious with the last of those which tells you how confident he\u2019s feeling. \u201cThere are a few instances of eight off a single ball via Law 19.8,\u201d emails Dave Loren. \u201cJohn Wright was a beneficiary in the early eighties when he\u2019d run four and Rod Marsh took an ill-advised shy at the stumps and instead sent it to the rope.\u201d 37th over: Bangladesh 172-4 (Mushfiqur 52, Mahmudullah 7) Mushfiqur\u2019s had enough, picking down the track to monster Dawlat over long on for six - that\u2019s his fifty. Three singles follow, making this Bangladesh\u2019s best over in quite some time. \u201cThere are ODI rankings; why not make use of them?\u201d wonders Uma Venkatraman. \u201cTop eight qualify for the world cup; everyone plays each other twice; top two play the final. It\u2019s not the length of the tournament that will bring spectators in, it\u2019s the quality of the matches.\u201d Because it\u2019s important to grow the game. The biggest event needs to be inclusive, and the plan is to have high-quality matches between everyone, eventually. 36th over: Bangladesh 163-4 (Mushfiqur 44, Mahmudullah 6) Rashid continues, and he\u2019s been much better in his second spell than his first. Mahmudullah picks out point for one, Mushfiqur adds one more, then Mahmudullah totally misjudges its final delivery, which grips and bounces, then misses the edge. On the one hand, that\u2019s good for Afghanistan; on the other, they\u2019ve got to bat in a bit. There\u2019ve been only four boundaries in the innings, and perhaps that\u2019s how to go about the chase: chuck the bat during the powerplay. \u201cI remember in the famous 1982-83 Ashes Test in Melbourne,\u201d says Rocket, \u201clate on the fourth day when England were trying to get Allan Border off strike and bowl to Jeff Thomson - Border hit the last ball of an over hard towards the western square boundary (where we were sitting) and the batsmen were running three. David Gower was running alongside the ball, hoping it would go into the boundary. From memory I think it just did, but we thought he was about to help it on it\u2019s way. We knew that rule, and Australia would have got seven runs rather than four. Which, all things being equal, would have resulted in a tie the next morning!\u201d 35th over: Bangladesh 161-4 (Mushfiqur 43, Mahmudullah 5) A single begins the over and brings Mahmudullah onto strike. He nudges into the covers and looks to run, but Mushfiqur isn\u2019t giving his wicket away for a man on one leg; he sends him back, the throw misses the stumps, and they indulge a languorous overthrow. One more single follows, and it\u2019s now 11 overs since Bangladesh hit a boundary while they\u2019ve not hit a six all innings. \u201cHe\u2019s not playing today, or for a while,\u201d says Rob Hogg, \u201cbut I have found find myself singing Shikhar Dhawan\u2019s name along with the chaps in this.\u201d Any more for any more? 34th over: Bangladesh 157-4 (Mushfiqur 41, Mahmudullah 3) That break probably served Bangladesh more than Afghanistan who, for the first time, will feel in the ascendancy. The batsmen take a single each, then Ma Ma Ma Ma Mahmuduallah Mahmuduallah flicks to midwicket and nobbles a hammy before he can turn for the second; no he doesn\u2019t. He looks to half a calf strain, because it\u2019s that part of his body being bandaged. Mushfiqur then forces him into another single - you\u2019ve got to laugh. \u201cLoving schmice!, frask! and zetz!\u201d emails Peter Salmon. \u201cObviously what we need is Batman retooled as Jewish, and sock!, biff! and bap! etc. replaced. Nah nah nah, Fledermoyz Man!\u201d Batman with added existential dread; he\u2019d be great at a party. 33rd over: Bangladesh 153-4 (Mushfiqur 39, Mahmudullah 1) Afghanistan are bang in this now - Soumya out the road before the closing slog is very helpful, and one more wicket will open up one end. Two from Gulbadin\u2019s latest over, and if his team can keep it tight for the next bit, they\u2019ll force the batsmen to force the issue. In the meantime, it\u2019s drinks. \u201c\u2019Zetz\u2019 is a great word that I\u2019ve never come across before, says Matt Dony. \u201cNow, I\u2019m a lover, not a fighter, so I don\u2019t tend to throw too many punches, but I\u2019d definitely like to start using the word. Am I allowed? Or is that cultural appropriation?\u201d Chutzpah, schmooze, klutz and such tell me that you\u2019re fine. And worry not: I\u2019ve never zetzed anyone in my life, but I still find plenty of contexts to enjoy the word, for example: \u201cYanky definitely did not get sufficiently zetzed on Friday night such that he somehow took a chunk out of his own lip\u201d. 32nd over: Bangladesh 151-4 (Mushfiqur 38, Mahmudullah 0) Anyone else sing Mahmudullah to this? No, there\u2019s on bat involved, but what\u2019s this? It the breaking past leg? No! umpire\u2019s call, and Soumya is gone. \u201cAsking, asking, getting!\u201d exclaims Mark Nicholas. Soumya is trapped by a full one, but is there bat involved? It\u2019s very close... 31st over: Bangladesh 148-3 (Mushfiqur 35, Soumya 3) Gulbadin sends down three dots before Soumya goes for a Red Bull single to mid off and doesn\u2019t bother grounding his bat at the other end; a direct hit makes him wonder, but we go upstairs and he\u2019s fine. Mushfiqur then drives to cover for one more and Soumya chases a wide one to guide two to third man. \u201cYou\u2019re watching this on your keyboard?\u201d asks Geoff Wignall. \u201cHow novel. Re the format how about this simple arrangement:three groups of five, top two from each group plus two best third place teams into the quarter finals? (With some fiendishly complicated tie-break arrangement for third placed teams if needed, understood only by three people at the ICC - or simply let them play each other.)3 7 games in total (without any tie-break) if quarter finals a knockout or 39 if they\u2019re round robin. India get to progress as far as their performance merits, which I realise might be too controversial a notion.\u201d Yes yes, very funny. My keyboard packed up, at which point I experienced intense emotion, which distracted me from the cricket on my screen. You\u2019ll be relieved to know that I am now equanimous once more. 30th over: Bangladesh 143-3 (Mushfiqur 33, Soumya 0) Afghanistan are still in this because every time they\u2019ve needed a wicket they\u2019ve got one but more than that, they\u2019ve got the right one. Meanwhile, Damien Burns gets in touch to resolve our legal issue: \u201cLaw 19.8 in the MCC Laws of Cricket states that: \u2018If the boundary results from an overthrow or from the wilful act of a fielder the runs scored shall be (i) any runs for penalties awarded to either side AND (ii) the allowance for the boundary AND (iii) the runs completed by the batsmen, together with the run in progress if they had already crossed at the instant of the throw or act. Law 18.12(b) (Batsman returning to wicket he has left) shall apply as from the instant of the throw or act.\u2019 So the single that the batsman took is awarded as well as the boundary, thereby adding 5 runs to the batting team, and the bastman would retain strike.\u201d So it literally is not cricket. Mujeed gives this one a real tweak, ripping fingers down the back of the ball, and it spins off a length, past the inside edge and raps the pad bang in front. And even in dismissal, Shakib shows his brilliance, eschewing the review because he knows he\u2019s out, even though he\u2019s also him. 30th over: Bangladesh 143-2 (Shakib 51, Mushfiqur 30) Mujeed returns. 29th over: Bangladesh 142-2 (Shakib 51, Mushfiqur 32) Afghanistan have slowed the scoring a little, but badly need to break this partnership. Mushfiqur edges a single - he\u2019s getting full use of his bat here - and two more singles follow. G.L. Sherwood is back in touch to wonder what \u201cshmice\u201d means, and this is one we can be sure I did not make up; it is yiddish for hit hard, and is usually administered to a child by a paren; one sporting team to another; a tin to a person. Other similar terms: \u201cfrask\u201d, which is usually a slap or a swipe, and \u201czetz\u201d, which is usually a punch. 28th over: Bangladesh 139-2 (Shakib 50, Mushfiqur 30) Mushfiqur plays three dots then caresses a single into the covers. This brings Shakib onto strike and he edges to backward square, easing through to raise his fifth fifty of the competition. Brilliant. \u201cModern trends have caused cricket to come off as a batsman\u2019s game,\u201d reckons OB Jato, \u201cbut at heart, I\u2019ve always felt that it\u2019s more of a bowler\u2019s game in fair conditions. Many of the matches in this World Cup so far as well as most of the 2018 Test season has proved this notion of bowlers coming out on top more often than not in duels against batters. As Azhar Mahmood said during an interview recently: \u201cIt takes 300 balls to get 480 runs, but it takes only 10 balls to get all 10 wickets.\u201d I\u2019d say that it\u2019s a batsman\u2019s game in that the laws are biased towards batsmen and the bat is usually on top, but it\u2019s a bowler\u2019s game in that great bowlers are less common. In limited overs, I don\u2019t think it matters much if what constitutes good bowling is conceding 60 not 80, or taking two key wickets, not none, but in Tests we need to be more careful. 27th over: Bangladesh 136-2 (Shakib 49, Mushfiqur 28) Gulbadin sends down a much-needed maiden to Shakib \u2013I think that\u2019s the first of the inning \u2013 and I am certain that Shakib isn\u2019t bothered. 26th over: Bangladesh 136-2 (Shakib 49, Mushfiqur 28) Aaargh! Nabi returns and absolutely rinses Mushfiqur with an off break that drifts, grips and turns; the batsman edges, the keeper can\u2019t gather what would\u2019ve been a reaction belter, and they run two. My keyboard then packs up so I miss what comes next, but the scoreboard tells me it\u2019s two singles. 25th over: Bangladesh 132-2 (Shakib 48, Mushfiqur 25) Gulbadin returns and Shakib edges his first delivery for two - there\u2019s no slip in place. As Metternich once said, I wonder what he meant by that. Eight off the over, the fifty partnership raised, and this is beginning to look like a match-settler. \u201cRegarding the format issue,\u201d says Kennedy Ross, \u201cRequirements: 1. We want more teams 2. We want more excitment, less predictability 3. Indians need to be going on to at least semis to keep BCCI happy. The solution would be to let India enter two separate teams, solving all three problems in one move.\u201d Tangentially, I wonder what it\u2019d take to get Virat Kohli involved when he retires. The combination of gravitas, edge and love would be extremely helpful. 24th over: Bangladesh 124-2 (Shakib 41, Mushfiqur 24) On comes Rahmat Shah, who gets away with one first up, short and wide; Shakib cuts hard, but straight to the sweeper at deep point and they run one. What I love about Shakib is most things, but what I\u2019m especially loving about Shakib right now is his equanimity. He misses out, he doesn\u2019t miss out, he lets it go and moves on, the kind of thing that\u2019s contagious. Anyhow, Rahmat cedes two more singles, then Mushfiqur takes a giant stride, stays low, and sweeps an excocet to the point fence. 23rd over: Bangladesh 117-2 (Shakib 39, Mushfiqur 19) Afghanistan are back in need a wicket territory and after Dawlat cedes four from his first three balls, he beats Mushfiqur outside off. Of course, karma takes its revenge, Mushfiqur swinging at the next one and top-edging four over the keeper\u2019s head. Two more follow to third man, and this is getting away from Afghhanistan now - that\u2019s 10 off the over. \u201cWhen Carlos Brathwaite was doing his best to drag West Indies over the line against New Zealand,\u201d emails Adithya, \u201cit struck me that if Brathwaite took a single off the last ball of the over to retain strike, the New Zealand fielder could throw the ball over the boundary in order to make it a four and get the No. 11 batsman on strike. This tactic only has application in a very particular kind of situation. 20-30 runs to defend against an explosive batsman who might knock it off with boundaries and a tailender whose wicket will give you the game. Have you ever seen or heard of any teams resorting to this?\u201d I\u2019ve not, but I like it very much indeed. The problem is the risk, I guess - you\u2019d look pretty silly if it failed - and, of course, though the laws permit it, assuming the laws permit it, it probably \u201cisn\u2019t cricket\u201d. 22nd over: Bangladesh 107-2 (Shakib 36, Mushfiqur 12) This is such clever batting, keeping the scoreboard ticking without taking risks. Sounds simple, isn\u2019t simple. 21st over: Bangladesh 103-2 (Shakib 35, Mushfiqur 9) This is such a key innings from Shakib. Obviously his team need the runs, but there\u2019s more to it than that - it\u2019s essence of captaincy. Even in cricket, where the job is about more than shouting and cajoling, in the end, its key aspect is leading from the front, especially at crucial times. This, there can be no doubt, is that. He takes two from the first ball of the over, nurdled to mid off, then adds a single to fine leg. Mushfiqur then edges one more, a wide follows, then another single into the leg side and that\u2019s eight from what seemed like quiet over. 20th over: Bangladesh 95-2 (Shakib 31, Mushfiqur 6) Rashid continues and is milked; I wonder if, in years to come, he\u2019ll see this competition as an important staging-post in his development, or just hate playing in England. Six off the over. \u201cAs refreshing as it is to see English supporters politely clap after every boundary or wicket,\u201d says Abhijato Sensarma, \u201cI\u2019ve always liked the spirit of subcontinental supporters more. Seeing the pure passion of the Afghan fans pleases me to no end. It could well be the sole reason I tune into every match they are at. Even today, they seem to be perennially happy to be here. This contingent is a synecdoche for the sense of pride, nationalism and inspiration sport is meant to encourage. No matter what happens on the pitch today, no admirer of cricket can resist giving their best of luck to Afghanistan and its fans going forward. Here\u2019s to hoping each one of us is as happy and passionate as them about something in our lives, be it our career, our partner, or the thing all souls turn to some time or the other - sport at its glorious best.\u201d I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ve correctly characterised an English crowd. It\u2019s like that at Lord\u2019s, but not anywhere else, and even there, we can wonder if the politeness is sincere. But in general I agree, rowdiness and abandon are beauties of sport, provided they\u2019re natural and refrain from cringe. 19th over: Bangladesh 89-2 (Shakib 29, Mushfiqur 2) Dawlat returns and cedes just a single from his first four deliveries, then tries a bouncer that\u2019s also wide, so is called wide. Shakib then opens the face and guides his next ball wide of slip; Asghar does really well to catch up with it and save the boundary as the batsmen run two then have a drink. \u201cWe\u2019re puzzled by the verb \u2018to squanty\u201d\u2019, tweets G.L. Sherwood. \u201cA cursory internet search throws up just one other use, in 2017, by a certain, hang on, er, Daniel Harris. Are you messing with us or what?\u201d Would I ever? I\u2019d love to claim the neologism, but the truth is that those who use it are not really into internets. When you squanty something - you usually squanty it down - you sort it out. It can often relate to a slightly dodgy activity, though it needn\u2019t. 18th over: Bangladesh 85-2 (Shakib 27, Mushfiqur 1) Suddenly it\u2019s all going off! Bangladesh are still pretty well-set, but if Afghanistan can find another, everything changes. Or is it! Shakib goes upstairs, and might he just be ok on height? YES HE IS! NOT OUT! Rashid bowls on a length, deceives Shakib with some extra bounce and raps him on the knee-roll! Up goes the fingers, and it\u2019s two in two! 17th over: Bangladesh 82-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 26) \u201cWhile I\u2019m all for countering the pervasive influence of the ICC BCCI wherever possible,\u201d says Alex Bramble, \u201cthey do occasionally happen on something vaguely intelligent: see the IPL eliminator. So I (and a few other OBOers over the past couple of weeks) suggest: two groups of 7, top-placed team in each group goes straight into the semi-finals, second- and third-placed teams play each other in two \u2018quarter\u2019- finals/eliminators.\u201d Yes, I could live with that. What we need is jeopardy, more teams to grow the game, and enough scope for classics at the business end. What comeback from Nabi, who bowls full and Tamim comes forward when he should go back, plays for more turn than there is, and the clatter tells him what\u2019s up. My word Afghanistan needed that! 17th over: Bangladesh 82-1 (Tamim 36, Shakib 31) Nabi continues and the batsmen take single apiece, then two dots before Tamim absolutely cleanses a short one to the fence at midwicket. 16th over: Bangladesh 76-1 (Tamim 31, Shakib 25) Rashid Khan into the attack, and his team need something from him - he\u2019s only got four wickets in this tournament, and that\u2019s not really enough given his status. The batsmen have a look at him and Tamim takes a two into the leg side. 15th over: Bangladesh 74-1 (Tamim 30, Shakib 24) This is really impressive from Bangladesh, who have this track squantied right down; they\u2019re keeping the scoreboard ticking without taking risks, then meting out treatment to the balls which demand it. This over yields only one, to Shakib, but the platform is set. 14th over: Bangladesh 73-1 (Tamim 30, Shakib 23) Tamim loses patience and twinkles down the track as Gulbadin releases to shmice him down the ground for four. Four singles follow, then Shakib attacks a short one that sits up and begs to be hit; he obliges with a pull to the midwicket fence and is now tournament\u2019s leading run-scorer. He and his team are getting away. Incidentally, I have now received about 57 different suggestions for how to structure this thing of ours, which tells you how hard it is. Shall we just have a fight instead? Or perhaps a quiz on Engoish cricket from the mid-80s to the mid-90s. 13th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 20, Shakib 21) Bangladesh will be happy with this. First, Nabi finds so much turn that it costs him a wide, then they milk him for a two and two ones. If these two bat for another 45 minutes, that might just be the game. \u201cThat\u2019s not disrespect for GnR,\u201d says Smylers, \u201cthis is disrespect for GnR \u2014 a cover version I was blissfully unaware of till it featured as a question on PopMaster this morning.\u201d I should add that Sarah O\u2019Regan has since emailed thusly: \u201cOh no, I didn\u2019t mean to slight GnR - far from it - I merely meant that the musician plays it a little too slow and a little too flat to be an accurate representation.\u201d I trust she will now called off her lawyers. 12th over: Bangladesh 56-1 (Tamim 19, Shakib 18) Gulbadin Naib into the attack and Shakib flips two to backward square to raise Bangladesh\u2019s fifty. Next ball, a leading edge to point - he was looking for midwicket - but with the fielders pushed back, no one was on hand to claim what would\u2019ve been a dolly. I wonder, though, if Gulbadin has missed a trick here - the outfield is slow and his team need wickets, so put men in wicket-taking positions. A two and three singles follow, which is to say that Afghanistan need something and fast. 11th over: Bangladesh 49-1 (Tamim 18, Shakib 12) Mujeeb is struggling to exert pressure here. The batsmen take him for four, a two to Tamim and a single apiece, and I fancy he\u2019ll be getting thanked pretty soon. \u201cSome countries do have special fans,\u201d emails John Starbuck, \u201cnot least Pakistan and West Indies. For England, it\u2019s the whole Barmy Army, which rather puts the kibosh on making a feature of it on the screens. But then, so many people (these days) are so used to appearing on screen, they probably barely notice older followers\u2019 disdain. I was a teenager in the 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s and wouldn\u2019t mind the guitar man if only he learned to play Link Wray\u2019s \u2018Rumble\u2019; a real classic.\u201d Sure, everyone\u2019s special and all that, but the artificial and performative nature of it all makes my teeth itch. I can think of little worse than a day at the cricket next to any kind of army or band. 10th over: Bangladesh 44-1 (Tamim 15, Shakib 10) Tamim shoves one to midwicket, then Nabi offers Shakib some width and he doesn\u2019t need asking twice, clattering four through backward point. A single follows, then Tamim bunts down the ground; they run one, then another when a shy flies past the stumps. That\u2019s Bangladesh\u2019s best over in a while, nine from it. 9th over: Bangladesh 35-1 (Tamim 12, Shakib 4) The pitch is a little slow here, which might make for drama later on, but isn\u2019t great for entertainment in the first instance, a little like in the South Africa-New Zealand match. In limited overs, we don\u2019t necessarily need balance between bat and ball because even on a 400 track, a bowler can make the difference, but if we reckon that a 330-350 track is ideal, you want the ball coming on so there\u2019s pace for the quick and strokemakers, along with dryness for the spinners. One off the over, and that a wide. 8th over: Bangladesh 34-1 (Tamim 12, Shakib 4) Three more singles from the over, and Afghanistan have slowed the socring; can they create a little more pressure? \u201cThe simple and easy answer,\u201d says Nick Parish, \u201cis four groups of four, top two in each group go through to the quarter-finals. Yes, I know it doesn\u2019t guarantee India get 73 games, but how much protection do the big countries need? Football, not normally a good example of anything, manages to deal with it when the big countries don\u2019t make the knockout stage (hello Germany 2018, hello England, Spain and Italy 2014).\u201d I\u2019m not sure about this one - I don\u2019t think there\u2019d be much jeopardy for the bigger nations, who\u2019d largely avoid each other until the end. What I like about the current format is that there are heavyweight contests all the way through. 7th over: Bangladesh 31-1 (Tamim 10, Shakib 3) Tamim takes a single, then Shakib nudges to point and sets off. A better throw from Shinwari and Tamim\u2019s got a situation, but it\u2019s wild and he makes it easily. He then adds another single and is looking nicely settled. 6th over: Bangladesh 28-1 (Tamim 8, Shakib 2) Mohammad Nabi into the attack and Tamim takes him for a single to deep square, the first of three in the over. \u201cI was at Headingley on Friday (I know, Jonah),\u201d says Ben Powell, \u201cand despite the result thoroughly enjoyed the day but for one or two interruptions. The cricket bat guitar and some sort of \u201cgreatest fan\u201d cam that popped up at regular, infuriating intervals. The cricket bat guitar is crass and pointless IMHO (as I understand the kids say), but the greatest fan thing was just hopeless. Every time it came up, cue a couple of nervous looking fans, embarrassingly and half-heatedly waving at the camera, which always lingered just that little too long. Cue also less than zero reaction from the rest of the crowd. I\u2019ve been to baseball and ice hockey in the States and Canada where they do this sort of thing regularly and it goes down a storm. That\u2019s where such manufactured atmosphere should stay. Harrumph.\u201d Yes, I\u2019d agree with that. Let people enjoy the sport and enjoy their company - there\u2019s no need to coordinate their fun for them, or entice them to behave in a particular manner. 5th over: Bangladesh 25-1 (Tamim 6, Shakib 1) My days, Afghanistan needed that, not because bangladesh have got away but because their entire strategy is predicated on early wickets. They know they can\u2019t chase a biggie, so need to get to work from the off. I really don\u2019t know! If the soft signal is not out, this is not out, because the evidence is inconclusive - it looks like there are fingers under the ball, but there\u2019s a fair chance it hits the ground nonetheless. Hashmatullah\u2019s head is up so he probably doesn\u2019t know himself, but the umpires have no option: they stay with the onfield decision. And there it is! Liton drives and, down on one knee, Hashmatullah pouches it at short cover ... or is it? The soft signal is out... 4th over: Bangladesh 23-0 (Liton 16, Tamim 5) Dawlat overpitches and Liton twizzles him through midwicket, but the damp outfield permits him only three. Tamim then takes strike and plays three dots, before stepping into an uppish drive which flies just wide of Ashar mid off \u2013 he\u2019s far to slow to move \u2013 and to the fence for four. He plays and misses at the next, but that\u2019s no use to Afghanistan, who badly need a breakthrough. \u201cI will leave for you to decide if this is McCullum/Morgan-esque fresh and funky thinking or Fakhar Zaman scooping to first slip idiocy (I know which way I\u2019m leaning)\u201c says Sam Collier, \u201cbut what about some kind of squash ladder affair? A roundrobin, teams initially ordered in reverse ICC ranking with the winning team moving one place above the team they defeat. Top four play semis as per the current format. It\u2019d certainly keep the tension going right to the end...\u201d 3rd over: Bangladesh 16-0 (Liton 13, Tamim 1) Three singles from over, Tamim now off the mark. \u201cIn answer to your question, \u2018How would you make this competition better?\u2019\u201d, emails Sarah O\u2019Regan, \u201cI suggest incorporating more national musical instruments, to replace the cricket bat guitar and its lugubrious Guns n\u2019 Roses dirge. In its place, the outgoing batsman should nip over to the music stage, play a jolly little ditty on a didgeridoo, a dafli daf, or a rubab, before heading off for the walk of shame.\u201d I\u2019d lap that up \u2013 tangentially, I\u2019ve long since argued that national anthems should be in the national style; basically, what I\u2019m saying is that God Save the Queen needs to be a jungle track, and what I\u2019m also saying is that I\u2019m a teenager of the early nineties, so I\u2019m not having that disrespect for GnR. 2nd over: Bangladesh 13-0 (Liton 11, Tamim 0) Dawlat Zadran starts with two dots, both pitched up, but then a shorter one allows Liton to play off the back foot and he times it away beautifully, behind square on the off side - and for extra points, it tantalises Mujeeb into a long, fruitless chase and dive. Glorious. Two dots follow, then a single. 1st over: Bangladesh 8-0 (Liton 6, Tamim 0) Good start for Bangladesh, Liton taking a single from Mujeeb\u2019s loosener and two wides follow. Liton then cuts a wide one and Rahmat Shah makes a right pig\u2019s arse of the stop, allowing the ball by him and to the fence. A single follows, and already Afghanistan are under pressure. How would you make this competition better? More teams, I\u2019d say, then maybe two big groups, and we probably need quarter-finals. On the one hand, that\u2019s a lot of games to eliminate not a lot of teams, but those knockouts will draw casual viewers, tutor them in the ways of righteousness, and induct them into this thing of ours. With just semis and a final, we\u2019re asking too much from just three matches. Afghanistan huddle. I reckon they\u2019re discussing whether it\u2019s a barm or a bun. Right, anthem time. The intro to Afghanistan\u2019s sounds not unlike Jump Around. Mathematics corner: I was wondering what people did in offices before the internet, and if the following equation is true. Work facilitated by the internet = work not done on account of the internet. Otherwise, how has productivity taken a colossal nosedive? \u201cSo, Virat Kohli has been filed his fees for showing dissent,\u201d emails Amod Paranjape. \u201cDissent my ass. It was pure and simple bullying and intimidation. We should not go on to win the World Cup. But since the universe rarely gives people what they want, we are sure to win it. Eh.\u201d I see what you\u2019re trying to do there. I don\u2019t know, though \u2013 I suppose I tend to err on the side of caution when handing out punishments for stuff that\u2019s central to the drama, edge and attitude of the game - if an umpire can\u2019t stand up to a player, then I\u2019m not certain the problem lies with the player. I also wonder what happens to the money. Both captains have made two changes. Afghanistan leave out Aftab Alam and Hazratullah Zazai, replaced by Dawlat Zadran and Samiullah Shinwari. As such, Rahmat Shah moves up the order to open instead of Zazai. Bangladesh, meanwhile, leave out Rubel Hossain and Sabbir Rahman, with Mosaddek Hossain and Mohammad Saifuddin coming in. I\u2019m really looking forward to watching Afghanistan\u2019s spinners - Mohammad Nabi, Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman offer such variety and nous. And, though Mark Nicholas and Ian Smith think their team should\u2019ve batted, what\u2019s the point in having good bowlers if they\u2019re trying to defend 180? That sounds sensible to me - if they don\u2019t bat well, the match is over before it\u2019s started. On the other hand, their bowling is their strong suit, so if they deploy it at the start, they can take control and hang on. Ian Smith isn\u2019t sure why, but thinks he\u2019d bat. While we wait, wrap yer peepers around this \u2013 I love love love Tony Cozier. Wendy Crozier, not so much \u2013 though these days, we\u2019d probably call her Wendy Crozeiyay. The toss has been delayed by 10 minutes, and will now be at 10.10am local time. It looks on the John Major side of grey in Southampton, but we should be good to go on time. Public service announcement: I just put on the radio, and heard a minute of a phone-in about Boris Johnson. With every fibre of my being, I urge you not to do the same, which is to say: thank expletive for cricket. Swing the mood. At the risk of sound parochial, you\u2019ve got to love Eoin Morgan\u2019s brave, young England side. Not only are they the greatest one-day outfit there will ever be, but they are also the most altruistic. In deliberately losing to Sri Lanka, they have, in one fell swoop, revitalised their home World Cup. Because of their unique gifts, matches which meant nothing now mean something, and the world is a better place on their account. Just ask Bangladesh. If they beat Afghanistan today, then India and Pakistan as well, they are through \u2013 provided Sri Lanka lose to South Africa, West Indies and India, and England only beat one of Australia, India and New Zealand. And they are capable of doing it. They have plenty of batting, canny bowling, and in Shakib al Hasan have an absolute star. Currently, he is the tournament\u2019s second-highest run-scorer \u2013 with a higher strike-rate than both David Warner and Joe Root, who lie first and third \u2013 while his bowling is threatening, his leadership absolute and his mentality unflappable. If his team are to do it, it will probably be because of him. Afghanistan, meanwhile, are 0 and 6, but just the other day gave India an almighty fright. That will have fired their confidence, and helped them believe that they can put everything together \u2013 they have plenty of talent, but are still learning the knowhow that will extract the most from it. Yes, they\u2019re a dog, but they\u2019re a live dog. Play: 10.30am BST",

      "bodyText": "Labour plans to give the Bank of England powers to help check the readiness of City firms to cut carbon emissions and invest responsibly to tackle the climate emergency. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, announced proposals for an unprecedented expansion of the central bank\u2019s role at the heart of policymaking, with officials at Threadneedle Street supporting the Treasury in checking on progress towards carbon targets. McDonnell said the Bank\u2019s governor would also join the next Labour chancellor on a sustainable investment board to oversee lending to British businesses with the aim of boosting productivity. Speaking to City executives in central London on Monday, McDonnell said Labour planned to conduct a review of City practices and how investments could be directed to promote technologies that cut carbon emissions. The review would focus on the shadow banking sector, where borrowing and lending takes place beyond the oversight of regulators. It will report by October as part of Labour\u2019s plans for a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d. McDonnell said: \u201cI am setting up a review group to overview the financial system as it currently relates to the climate emergency, in terms of both where and how it is causing or exacerbating the problem of climate change and where and how it could be providing solutions to problems.\u201d He repeated his warning that firms listed on the London Stock Exchange that failed to meet environmental targets risked being denied access to the main equity market, forcing them to become private businesses or list in other jurisdictions. \u201cThis means that when we delist companies that fail to meet environmental criteria from the London Stock Exchange, investors can be confident that their money is not going on making the world uninhabitable for their children,\u201d McDonnell said. Labour has already set out wide-ranging plans for a network of regional banks and an enhanced post office network to promote investment. McDonnell said these institutions would be given the dual role of increasing investment in green technologies and making a profit. The shadow Treasury team has already met representatives from Extinction Rebellion, the radical environmental protest group, to hear their ideas for addressing the climate crisis. Proposals from the independent Committee on Climate Change, headed by the former Tory minister John Gummer, and from the National Infrastructure Commission have already played a large part in Labour\u2019s thinking, McDonnell said. However, while Labour has committed to the target of reducing carbon emissions to net zero by at least 2050, in line with the government\u2019s aim, there are few policy details to say how it would get there. The review of the City would include commercial banks, investment banks, pension funds, hedge funds, private equity and asset managers to cover areas of the City that often escape scrutiny. Labour has put together a panel to review how the government and the Bank\u2019s new responsibilities can be implemented, including the former head of the civil service Lord Kerslake and the prominent City lawyer Peter Rice. \u201cThe UK is and will remain a hub for finance,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cThat gives us all the more responsibility to make sure that the lending that takes place here aids the tackling of the climate crisis rather than fuelling it.\u201d Labour plans to offer a mix of stiffer regulation and tax incentives to promote \u201clarge-scale beneficial investment\u201d to support growth. \u201cBut we will also fulfil our responsibility to ensure adequate policing of investments using the mechanisms available to us to require companies to live up to their climate change responsibilities,\u201d McDonnell said. The Bank\u2019s monetary policy committee currently sets Britain\u2019s interest rates while its financial policy committee and the Prudential Regulatory Authority oversee the financial stability of the banking sector and City firms. An expansion of the bank\u2019s role to encompass promoting investment and higher levels of productivity while separately supporting Labour\u2019s decarbonisation of the economy would make it the most powerful independent central bank in the developed world. Responding to questions about Labour\u2019s stance on Brexit, McDonnell said he would prefer to campaign to remain in a referendum or general election despite representing a constituency that voted to leave the EU.",

      "body": "<p>The headmaster of Colfe\u2019s School says he would welcome a debate about the role of independent schools within our education system (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/17/private-schools-can-serve-the-public-well\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 18 June). The debate is simple. As long as rightwing governments continue to close state school playing fields, cut the education budget to below first-world standards and generally make life difficult for state schools, they will flounder. By contrast, the well-funded private schools will provide even more state-of-the-art facilities and more middle-class parents will bankrupt themselves in order to get their children into these institutions.</p> <p>The pleas from the Independent Schools Council about bursaries and assisted places are just tokenism. The continued existence of a private fee-paying sector is a big part of what keeps this country in the educational and social dark ages. It\u2019s 70 years since Churchill and RA Butler failed to grasp this particular nettle. The only good thing that might be said about Brexit is that it may finally force us to confront these systemic problems in our national life \u2013 but at what cost.<br><strong>David Redshaw</strong><br><em>Gravesend, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps Helen Brown (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jun/17/private-schools-can-serve-the-public-well\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 18 June) is missing the point in her letter on private schools. My children also have \u201chard-working parents\u201d, but however hard I worked (in my case as a teacher in a state school), I would never be able to afford to send them to a private school. How can we ever hope to achieve a more equal society when some children benefit from a better education simply because of their parents\u2019 financial situation? Should not all children have the right to a decent education?<br><strong>Jane Moorhouse</strong><br><em>Worcester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Your <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/16/the-guardian-view-on-impoverished-schools-charity-is-not-the-answer\" title=\"\">editorial</a> (17 June) mentions an 8% cut in funding per pupil in English schools since 2009. This is certainly not representative of some schools and colleges. The sixth-form college of which I was principal and am now a governor had \u00a34,719 per student for the year ending August 2010 and \u00a34,128 per student for the year ending August 2018 \u2013 a cut of over 12% in eight years. However, this ignores the effect of inflation. If the ONS figure for inflation is incorporated, the value of the 2018 figure drops to \u00a33,315 in 2010\u2019s pounds \u2013 a cut of almost 30%. That this is impossibly unsustainable should be clear to anyone.

      "bodyText": "The headmaster of Colfe\u2019s School says he would welcome a debate about the role of independent schools within our education system (Letters, 18 June). The debate is simple. As long as rightwing governments continue to close state school playing fields, cut the education budget to below first-world standards and generally make life difficult for state schools, they will flounder. By contrast, the well-funded private schools will provide even more state-of-the-art facilities and more middle-class parents will bankrupt themselves in order to get their children into these institutions. The pleas from the Independent Schools Council about bursaries and assisted places are just tokenism. The continued existence of a private fee-paying sector is a big part of what keeps this country in the educational and social dark ages. It\u2019s 70 years since Churchill and RA Butler failed to grasp this particular nettle. The only good thing that might be said about Brexit is that it may finally force us to confront these systemic problems in our national life \u2013 but at what cost. David Redshaw Gravesend, Kent \u2022 Perhaps Helen Brown (Letters, 18 June) is missing the point in her letter on private schools. My children also have \u201chard-working parents\u201d, but however hard I worked (in my case as a teacher in a state school), I would never be able to afford to send them to a private school. How can we ever hope to achieve a more equal society when some children benefit from a better education simply because of their parents\u2019 financial situation? Should not all children have the right to a decent education? Jane Moorhouse Worcester \u2022 Your editorial (17 June) mentions an 8% cut in funding per pupil in English schools since 2009. This is certainly not representative of some schools and colleges. The sixth-form college of which I was principal and am now a governor had \u00a34,719 per student for the year ending August 2010 and \u00a34,128 per student for the year ending August 2018 \u2013 a cut of over 12% in eight years. However, this ignores the effect of inflation. If the ONS figure for inflation is incorporated, the value of the 2018 figure drops to \u00a33,315 in 2010\u2019s pounds \u2013 a cut of almost 30%. That this is impossibly unsustainable should be clear to anyone. We are a wealthy country, yet we cannot afford to educate our young people \u2013 a shameful indictment of our government and its priorities.

      "body": "<p>Standing waiting for my English breakfast tea in the Last Word cafe in the forecourt of the British Library. A supervisor breezed in and interrupted service to scoop up mobiles from the counter staff. These were retrieved from bags and from a lower shelf. As she departed with her hands full, I asked what was the reason for this intriguing performance. She was called back and explained to me that this was because the contract of employment stipulated that staff should not have their mobiles on their bodies while serving. I pointed out that there is an obvious difference between an obligation not to have or to use mobiles while serving on the one hand, and their duty to hand over their mobiles to their supervisor. Since clearly I did not understand, the rules were patiently explained again to me. Staff had to sign a contract that stated they could not have their mobiles while working.</p> <p>After going over our respective different interpretation of the \u201crules\u201d, I gave up. But the image is with me. The staff were adults. They were trusted to work with electrically powered equipment and furthermore with equipment that generated hot water and steam. But they could not be left to comply with clearly stated rules. Transgression against these rules, which have potential safety implications, presumably carried sanctions of which they were aware. So why this need to subordinate themselves to the supervisor\u2019s whim? What else will an employer feel that she/he has the right to sequestrate in a bizarre ritual of preventive action?</p> <p>I wonder about the extent to which employers go in their desire to control those who have the misfortune to depend on them for their livelihood.<br><strong>Professor Anita J Prazmowska</strong><br><em>London </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tone/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers? </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/jan/15/share-your-best-photographs-of-the-week-with-us\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Click here</em></strong></a><strong><em> to upload it and we\u2019ll publish the best submissions in the letters spread of our print edition</em></strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "Standing waiting for my English breakfast tea in the Last Word cafe in the forecourt of the British Library. A supervisor breezed in and interrupted service to scoop up mobiles from the counter staff. These were retrieved from bags and from a lower shelf. As she departed with her hands full, I asked what was the reason for this intriguing performance. She was called back and explained to me that this was because the contract of employment stipulated that staff should not have their mobiles on their bodies while serving. I pointed out that there is an obvious difference between an obligation not to have or to use mobiles while serving on the one hand, and their duty to hand over their mobiles to their supervisor. Since clearly I did not understand, the rules were patiently explained again to me. Staff had to sign a contract that stated they could not have their mobiles while working. After going over our respective different interpretation of the \u201crules\u201d, I gave up. But the image is with me. The staff were adults. They were trusted to work with electrically powered equipment and furthermore with equipment that generated hot water and steam. But they could not be left to comply with clearly stated rules. Transgression against these rules, which have potential safety implications, presumably carried sanctions of which they were aware. So why this need to subordinate themselves to the supervisor\u2019s whim? What else will an employer feel that she/he has the right to sequestrate in a bizarre ritual of preventive action? I wonder about the extent to which employers go in their desire to control those who have the misfortune to depend on them for their livelihood.

I pulled out of the doubles [semi-final in Birmingham] to try to give it the best chance to be ready for singles. It\u2019s smarter to take time to let my body rest.\u201d</p> <p>Barty said after leaving Paris she was looking forward to preparing fully on grass in readiness for Wimbledon, where she will be a warm favourite. \u201cThe more grass court matches you can get before Wimbledon, the better,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But her coach, Craig Tyzzer, said on Monday: \u201cWe have to monitor how much she plays. If she had played a lot this week then maybe Wimbledon is not a viable option. So this makes sense.\u201d</p> <p>Clearly Birmingham took its toll. Although Barty did not drop a set, she had to beat Donna Vekic, Venus Williams, Barbora Strycova and her own doubles partner, Julia G\u00f6rges.</p> <p>Barty, who began the day as the top-ranked player in the world, leapfrogging Naomi Osaka, said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, to be honest. It\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind \u2013 over the last month, over the last 24 hours. It\u2019s been the most incredible time of my life, it really has. It\u2019s come around so quickly, but I\u2019ve done so much work with my team. I\u2019m so proud of them and all the work that they do, all the time and energy that they invest in my career. I do have the best team in the world.\u201d</p> <p>Barty\u2019s late withdrawal is a blow for the tournament, although it at least opens up the field for others, particularly the British No 1, Johanna Konta, who was on track to meet her in the third round. Konta beat the Ukrainian qualifier Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-4 on Monday and now faces Maria Sakkari of Greece.</p> <p>Andy Murray hit briefly with his latest doubles partner, the experienced Brazilian Marcelo Melo, in preparation for their match on Tuesday against the No 1 seeds from Colombia, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah, whom Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez beat in the first round on their way to the title at Queen\u2019s.</p> <p>The former world No 1, who has been out for five months recovering from hip surgery, said the only aftershock from his comeback tournament was a stiff back. \u201cMost players, when they come back from a big operation and haven\u2019t played for five months, you\u2019d expect to be a bit stiff and sore in a few places,\u201d the 32-year\u2011old said. \u201cBut overall I\u2019m really happy with how I feel. We had a light practice today. I\u2019ll rest up and hopefully feel all right tomorrow. It\u2019s a pretty quick turnaround.\u201d</p> <p>One of the reasons Murray has returned to the game is so his two daughters can see what their father does for a living. But he said when he showed the eldest, three-year-old Sophia, the plate he received for winning at Queen\u2019s, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t particularly interested\u201d.</p> <p>He is more relaxed now than at any time in his career and determined to enjoy the moment, rather than move on quickly to the next tournament.</p> <p>He had wanted to sky-dive with his team after winning a title in Dubai in 2017, but they had declined. When it was put to him he might like to bungee jump off Beachy Head if he did well here, he smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019d be up for it, but I\u2019m not going to do it on my own. I\u2019d do it if all my team were up for it, although I don\u2019t know if my hip surgeon would be particularly happy with me trying that.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s smarter to take time to let my body rest.\u201d Barty said after leaving Paris she was looking forward to preparing fully on grass in readiness for Wimbledon, where she will be a warm favourite. \u201cThe more grass court matches you can get before Wimbledon, the better,\u201d she said. But her coach, Craig Tyzzer, said on Monday: \u201cWe have to monitor how much she plays. If she had played a lot this week then maybe Wimbledon is not a viable option. So this makes sense.\u201d Clearly Birmingham took its toll. Although Barty did not drop a set, she had to beat Donna Vekic, Venus Williams, Barbora Strycova and her own doubles partner, Julia G\u00f6rges. Barty, who began the day as the top-ranked player in the world, leapfrogging Naomi Osaka, said: \u201cIt hasn\u2019t sunk in yet, to be honest. It\u2019s been a bit of a whirlwind \u2013 over the last month, over the last 24 hours. It\u2019s been the most incredible time of my life, it really has. It\u2019s come around so quickly, but I\u2019ve done so much work with my team. I\u2019m so proud of them and all the work that they do, all the time and energy that they invest in my career. I do have the best team in the world.\u201d Barty\u2019s late withdrawal is a blow for the tournament, although it at least opens up the field for others, particularly the British No 1, Johanna Konta, who was on track to meet her in the third round. Konta beat the Ukrainian qualifier Dayana Yastremska 6-2, 6-4 on Monday and now faces Maria Sakkari of Greece. Andy Murray hit briefly with his latest doubles partner, the experienced Brazilian Marcelo Melo, in preparation for their match on Tuesday against the No 1 seeds from Colombia, Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah, whom Murray and Feliciano L\u00f3pez beat in the first round on their way to the title at Queen\u2019s. The former world No 1, who has been out for five months recovering from hip surgery, said the only aftershock from his comeback tournament was a stiff back. \u201cMost players, when they come back from a big operation and haven\u2019t played for five months, you\u2019d expect to be a bit stiff and sore in a few places,\u201d the 32-year\u2011old said. \u201cBut overall I\u2019m really happy with how I feel. We had a light practice today. I\u2019ll rest up and hopefully feel all right tomorrow. It\u2019s a pretty quick turnaround.\u201d One of the reasons Murray has returned to the game is so his two daughters can see what their father does for a living. But he said when he showed the eldest, three-year-old Sophia, the plate he received for winning at Queen\u2019s, \u201cshe wasn\u2019t particularly interested\u201d. He is more relaxed now than at any time in his career and determined to enjoy the moment, rather than move on quickly to the next tournament. He had wanted to sky-dive with his team after winning a title in Dubai in 2017, but they had declined. When it was put to him he might like to bungee jump off Beachy Head if he did well here, he smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019d be up for it, but I\u2019m not going to do it on my own. I\u2019d do it if all my team were up for it, although I don\u2019t know if my hip surgeon would be particularly happy with me trying that.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, did not discuss the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in a meeting with the Saudi king, it has been reported, in the latest sign the Trump administration is trying to drop the subject. Pompeo said in a tweet that he had had a \u201cproductive meeting\u201d with King Salman \u201cto discuss heightened tensions in the region and the need to promote maritime security in the strait of Hormuz\u201d. \u201cFreedom of navigation is paramount,\u201d he said. Asked about the slaughter and dismemberment of Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October, an unnamed senior state department official travelling with Pompeo told Reuters news agency the subject did not come up. In an interview broadcast on Sunday, Donald Trump said he had talked to the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, on Friday but the Khashoggi murder \u201creally didn\u2019t come up in that discussion\u201d. The president sought to deflect further questions about the killing, saying Iran killed more people and pointing to Saudi spending on US weapons and other goods. \u201cThey spend $400 to $450bn over a period of time, all money, all jobs, buying equipment,\u201d Trump told NBC News. \u201cAnd by the way, if they don\u2019t do business with us, you know what they do? They\u2019ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese.\u201d The official line put out by administration officials in routine briefings is that those responsible for murdering Khashoggi must be held to account, and that investigations are continuing. A report issued earlier this month by the special UN investigator, Agn\u00e8s Callamard, said there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Saudi crown prince bore responsibility for the murder. Her report also found that the Saudi and Turkish investigations into the murder failed to meet international standards and the Saudi inquiry in particular was conducted in such bad faith it could amount to act of obstruction.

      "bodyText": "A report will follow shortly. Thanks for reading. A good start to the tournament in terms of a result for the Ivory Coast, less so in terms of performance. Jonathan Kodjia celebrates with fans, throwing his shirt into the crowd. South Africa were limited in outlook, and limited when having to chase down an equaliser. It could be a tough road for them to get to the last 16. 90+2 min: There were four minutes added on to the 90. South Africa not making much of a fist of forcing that final chance but a Zaha foul gives them one. Ooof, Vilakazi gets to the knockdown and smashes the ball into the sky. Euro Stu Baxter is enraged his man didn\u2019t do better with that. 90 min: Zaha, down in the left-hand channel, forces a corner after making a weaving run to the byline. South Africa fail to get it clear and Zaha plays keep-ball in the corner, before conceding a goal kick. 89 min: Great save from Williams! Pepe gets chance to whip in a ball for a free-kick with his left foot, and and it was flying in. Only fingertips prevented it going in. 87 mins: Two more Ivorian subs: On comes Doumbia and Cornet, and off go Coulibaly and Gradel, who had already left the field in the cramp stretcher. 85 min: South Africa should have had a penalty as Veldwijk was bundled over by Traore. No VAR but it would surely have been given by our new computerised friends. VAR does not come in until the quarter-finals. 83 min: That corner came to nothing and Kessie takes it forward. Zaha gets a chance to play in Kodija but South Africa hurriedly clear. Then Gradel almost gets Kodija in and fails. 81 min: South Africa try to pick a way through and have to settle for a corner. Veldwijk comes on for Mothiba, and will be the target. He looks a big lad. 79 min: Tau, the liveliest player for South Africa, and who has been the architect of their most dangerous moments from set pieces, looks to be flagging. He gives away a tired free-kick. 77 min: Near disaster for the Ivorians as Gbohouo drops the ball from a South African cross. He gratefully drops to the floor to snaffle the ball. He has not been convincing at all. 75 min: South Africa sub at long last: Maboe for Vilakazi. 74 min: Wonlo goes down with cramp. The Algerian referee is not sympathetic, and asks him to leave the field. He does so on a stretcher, which seems excessive. A drinks break breaks out. 73 min: Europe\u2019s Stuart Baxter is sticking to his guns, and has not made a sub just yet. His South African players\u2019 tired legs may not thank him for that. 71 min: The Ivorian fans are now in fuller voice and grooving away in the stands. Their team has an expected if not fully deserved lead. 69 min: What can South Africa do? They haven\u2019t shown enough in attack. They now have Zaha to contend with, as he comes on for Seri, who had a poor game. 66 min: That was what the Ivorians had been trying to do all game, and the South Africans had looked wise to. Kodija\u2019s finish was not superb, but it was enough. Wonlo and Gradel\u2019s contributions were crucial. At last! Wonlo plays it out to the left, and Gradel slides it across first time. This time,Kodjia cannot miss. 64 min: Traore averts danger when Tau escapes on to a long ball, and goalkeeper Gbohouo panics. 61 min: This is turgid, let\u2019s be honest now. Kanon is booked, and he looks mystified. Footballers often look mystified when decisions go against him, but this time he was justified. He seemed to do little more than put the ball in touch. Thankfully, Aurier clears the resultant free-kick. 59 min: Aurier whips in the ball but it\u2019s cleared at the back post when Gradel was coming in dangerously. 57 min: Ouch, a heavy collision and one that could be heard around the ground. Gradel jumps into the back of Maboe. The referee, who is a real stickler, waves a yellow card. Meanwhile, Wonlo is asked to leave the field to change his shirt by the Algerian fusspot. 55 min: This time, Pepe releases the ball quickly but Kodija was looking in the other direction. This has been a poor show from the start of the second half. 54 min: When will we see Zaha? That might change things up for the Ivorians, but he will need someone to give him the ball. Meanwhile, Pepe is wasteful as he finds space. Kodjia was the out-ball, but it never got to him. 52 min: Hlanti, on a surge forwards from full-back, gets down the left, but his cross to the middle is unable to find a South African teammate. 50 min: That Ivorian midfield of Seri and Kessi\u00e9, two players with big reputations, have been disappointing. Perhaps they are struggling in the heat. 49 min: Ivory Coast begin on the front foot, just as they did the first half. South Africa are again back in big numbers. 47 min: Gradel surges on and forces a corner. Mothiba, back from the front line, comes back to head the ball clear. 46 min: Aurier launches the ball immediately into touch. Not a great start though he was aiming for Pepe, which may bode better. We are back, with the Ivorian players geeing themselves up in the tunnel. Their first half was a disappointment. Guardian colleague Nick Ames, on location, hold a similar view of that 45 minutes, as well as kicking against the man. The heat hasn\u2019t helped but it\u2019s been no classic. Ivory Coast might be ahead, had Kodjia done better with the best chance of the match, but South Africa have been organised and look to have a threat at set pieces. 45 min: Two minutes added on. It\u2019s been bitty, with our Glaswegian referee Ghorbal now asking Aurier to leave the field because of his shin socks not being correctly tethered in. 44 min: Pepe, transfer fans, has looked assured in possession and a cut above when he has the ball, supplying the moment of the match so far with that free-kick. Thing is that he hasn\u2019t seen nearly enough of the ball. 43 min: South Africa\u2019s latest corner causes trouble again, but they are a little slack in attack themselves. Worth pointing out that Seri, channelling his Craven Cottage self, has now been booked for lax foul in midfield. 41 min: Gradel and Pepe link but it is South Africa who instead go on the break and Gradel is forced to run back to prevent the counter becoming more dangerous. 39 min: Peter Oh relives the glory days: \u201cVuvuzela reverie. Ah yes, the petrol-powered leafblower/mosquito-buzzing drone of the vuvuzela. Takes me right back to the days of turning down the volume during televised matches of the 2010 World Cup.\u201d 37 min: Kodjia is tackled on the run as another Ivorian attack breaks down. Seri has been in Fulham mode; disappointing and anonymous. 35 min: South Africa are concentrating on the set pieces for their route to goal, but have also picked up their share of possession. Ivory Coast are probably happier with that, as it allows them to play on the counter. 33 min: Close again for Ivory Coast! Kodjia is through on goal after he seizes on a header from Traore that evaded everybody. He decides to burst the back of the net and succeeds in hitting Williams, the South African goalkeeper. A waste but also a good save. 31 min: Close! A half hour in, and it\u2019s time for a drinks break. Much needed, too. Pepe meanwhile, slips a defender and is then fouled. An Ivorian free-kick will be whipped in by Pepe himself, who rattles the angle of bar and post. 28 min: Another South African free-kick - they are totting these up - and it\u2019s whipped by Mothiba at Hlanti, only for an infringement to delay play. 25 min: Mothiba forces a corner. South Africa edging into this a little. It clears everyone and the ball is clippped in for Hlatshwayo to head wide. Perhaps the best chance so far but the ball was a little too high for him. 23 min: Yellow card for South Africa\u2019s Mothiba, who barged heavily into Aurier. Looks a harsh one, not much more there than over-exuberance. 22 min: Gradel, out on the left wing, begins an attack that again comes to nothing. South Africa are doing a good job of shutting this down so far. 20 min: Hello, here\u2019s a South Africa free-kick in the opposing half. They take it short, and try and play it short to set up an overload on the left-hand side of the box, but Zwane\u2019s header is weak. 18 min: Ivory Coast pushing on without looking too fluent. This is not a game being played at the rarest pace; little wonder given the heat of an Egyptian summer. 16 min: Ivorian corner, but that comes to nothing, then a loose foul buys South Africa some breathing time. Kanon is the target on the set pieces. 14 min: South Africa actually get into the opposite half, but then kick the ball out for a throw-in. This has been a most Pulis-ian start to the tournament from them. 12 min: Die slips in Gradel, who then whips the ball in the direction of Kodija, who is prevented from getting his nut on the ball after Hlanti got a touch to it. 10 min: First shot of the game and it\u2019s a wild one. Kessie wallops the ball miles into the empty stands. 9 min: South Africa have been, well, rather unambitious in a game of supreme caginess. From them, in any case. This is classic tournament opener stuff so far. 7 min: On Stuart Baxter\u2019s nationality, from the man himself on the Wiki oracle: \u201cIf I\u2019m mentioned for a job in Scotland, they call me a Scot. If I\u2019m mentioned for a job in England, they call me an Englishman. I call myself a European.\u201d 5 min: Ivory Coast in attack, South Africa sitting back has been the pattern of the game so far. And can be expected to continue in that vein. 3 min: First glimpse of Pepe in action as he glides forward and slides in a pass to Kodjia, who then swings and misses. The Villa striker should have done better. 2 min: Furman takes a knock from a hefty forearm smash from Kodjia. No foul given, which seems lenient. The vuvuzela chorus reminds that South Africa are playing in this match.... Stuart Baxter, the South African coach, is keeping his suit jacket on in temperatures nearing 40 degrees. You can take the boy out of Scotland.... The Ivorian fans in orange are getting into the spirit of things, with some groovy moves on show ahead of kick-off. The teams are on their way to the field and it\u2019s time for the anthems. South Africa\u2019s never fails to be rousing, though sounds better when there is enough of a crowd to sing along. It has to be said there is not a huge crowd readying itself for this match; ticket sales seem to have been a problem at this tournament. It was put together at short notice, after all, and may not be readily accessible to fans from either country. In any case, both teams have arrived at the stadium in full voice, both singing as they get off their coaches. South Africa in the Afcon will always bring back fond memories of 1996. The most striking team news ahead of the match. Daniel Levy might be making careful note of the value that the Ivory Coast place in Wilfried Zaha\u2019s jewel. We are still in the first round of the first round. How have things been going so far? Ivory Coast: Gbohouo, Aurier, Kanon, Traore, Coulibaly, Kessi\u00e9, Die, P\u00e9p\u00e9, Seri, Gradel, Kodjia Subs: Tape, Doumbia, Gbamin, Angban, Zaha, Cornet, Bony, Assal\u00e9, Comara, Bagayoko, Sangar\u00e9 South Africa: Williams, Hlanti, Mkhwanazi, Hlatshwayo, Mkhize, Mokotjo, Furman, Maboe, Zwane, Tau, Mothiba. Subs: D. Keet, Bvuma, Cardoso, Mphahlele, Maela, Zungu, Serero, Kekana, Mabunda, Lorch, Veldwijk, Vilakazi The referee is Algeria\u2019s (via Glasgow?) Mustapha Ghorbal Two former winners take to the Afcon stage in Cairo, though neither are particularly fancied to win the 2019 renewal. Ivory Coast\u2019s line-up features plenty of Premier League experience in Wilfrieds Zaha and Bony, Serge Aurier, Max Gradel, Jean Micha\u00ebl Seri and one for next season in Aston Villa\u2019s Jonathan Kodjia. AC Milan\u2019s Franck Kessi\u00e9 is another player to watch. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, of Lille, will be a name familiar to all you transfers fetishists out there; he has been linked with PSG, Liverpool and Bayern Munich. Still, though, this is not a team to match the previous golden generation of Didier Drogba and a pair of Tour\u00e9 brothers that really should have done more than triumph in just win one Cup of Nations, as they did in 2015. As for South Africa, coached by the experience of Scotsman Stuart Baxter, they feature far fewer names that have made a splash in Europe, though Percy Tau, owned by Brighton though he has never played a game for the Albion, could the man to watch in attack. He will be in tandem with Lebo Mothiba of Strasbourg, and could represent trouble for what does not look like a particularly strong Ivorian defence; Eric Bailly, sadly predictably, has missed this tournament through injury. The match kicks off at 3.30pm UK time.",

      "bodyText": "Conservatives stepped up warnings on Monday that a Boris Johnson premiership could lead to the collapse of the government if the leadership frontrunner attempts to pursue no deal. One former Tory minister said he believed there were many more Tory MPs who would be prepared to take that step than those who would publicly admit it. \u201cI do think at least 10 would vote to bring down the government if the government was taking us into no deal,\u201d the MP said. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t like to admit that they take this view in public, they like to hedge their bets a bit, but that has been my view for a long time.\u201d Tobias Ellwood, the defence minister, said he believed at least a dozen Conservative MPs could be forced into voting against the government. Asked if the Conservatives who felt so strongly against no deal had the numbers, Ellwood told the BBC: \u201cI believe that absolutely is the case. I think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.\u201d Ellwood later denied he would be among those MPs prepared to vote against the government in a confidence vote. \u201cI simply state the huge long-term dangers of no deal to our economy, security, reputation, the Union and our Party,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI simply forecast there are some who will do all to stop this. Let\u2019s avoid this scenario: leave with a workable deal.\u201d His statement was retweeted by the Conservative MP Antoinette Sandbach, who is among those who has rebelled over giving parliament a meaningful vote on the deal, as well as efforts to halt no deal. The Tory MP Guto Bebb, a backer of the pro-referendum People\u2019s Vote campaign, also said he believed there were enough Conservative MPs prepared to stop no deal. \u201cIf a Conservative leader seriously tried to carry out such a policy, they would face almost certain humiliation in parliament, deepen the sense of crisis and paralysis in the country and widen the divisions inside our party,\u201d he said. \u201cEnough Conservative MPs will put country ahead of party to stop no deal. When that happens we may end up facing an election which no serious Conservative wants.\u201d The former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke, who along with Dominic Grieve has publicly said he would vote against a Conservative government to stop no deal, said: \u201cIf it is heading for a no deal simply because the government has not got around to doing anything then yes I think I would. \u201cI\u2019m a lifelong Conservative, that means I\u2019m pro-business, I\u2019m in favour of free markets, I\u2019m in favour of free trade and I think all those should be combined with a strong social conscience because I\u2019m a one nation Conservative.

      "bodyText": "Given the frenzied speculation about who will be the next leader of the Conservative party and thus prime minister, it was understandable that other news would get far less attention. Last week it was reported that the infant mortality rate (IMR) in England and Wales had worsened, for the third year in a row. The report from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), covering 2017, said that \u201cthe infant mortality rate increased to 3.9 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 3.8 in 2016\u201d. In 2014, it was 3.6 deaths per 1,000. The situation had been improving steadily until 2014, when it went into reverse. This should not be happening, especially in one of the largest economies in the world. Alarmingly, when declines such as this have occurred elsewhere, for example in the Soviet Union in the 1980s, it has been an early marker of severe problems in society. But while these figures are sufficiently concerning in their own right, they are national averages and the situation is even worse in some places.

Equally concerning, the UK now lags well behind many other European countries, with 24 nations achieving better rates out of the 42 with available data for 2017. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: \u201cTo address the UK\u2019s dismal infant mortality rates, it is paramount that the government take immediate steps to tackle social inequality and improve maternal and early years care.\u201d This is not the first time urgent action has been called for. As Viner notes, the reasons these babies are dying in increasing numbers are complex. Healthcare plays a part, but so do the conditions in which they and their families live, work, grow and play \u2013 what we call the social determinants of health. And many of these are inextricably linked to the growing rates of child poverty in the UK. Yet, despite clear evidence and recommendations, no action has been taken.

This conspiracy also involved the Russian athletics chief and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev, Russia\u2019s former national middle distance coach Alexei Melnikov, Diack\u2019s former aide Habib Ciss\u00e9 and the IAAF\u2019s former head of anti-doping, Gabriel Doll\u00e9. These four will also face trial on the same charges, along with Diack\u2019s son, Papa Massata Diack, the disgraced former IAAF marketing executive who was banned for life from athletics in 2016. They all deny the charges. All six will be tried for their role in the case of Liliya Shobukhova, the London Marathon winner in 2010, who paid $600,000 in exchange for covering up violations in her athlete biological passport thus allowing her to compete in the London 2012 Olympic Games. According to the prosecutors, Diack and his son, who oversees a sports consulting business called Black Tidings, solicited payments from athletes, either directly or indirectly, totalling \u20ac3.45m in exchange for covering up positive doping tests and allowing athletes to go on competing. Massata Diack has also emerged as a central figure in French judicial probes of suspected corruption involving the 2016 and 2020 Olympic Games and other sports events. The judicial official says the younger Diack will stand trial for complicity in corruption and money laundering. Believed to be living in Senegal, he could be tried in absentia. The French authorities have also been investigating allegations Diack Sr received bribes for his votes in several bidding contests for high-profile sports events. The former International Olympic Committee member is claimed to have controlled the votes of several African colleagues. It is alleged that Diack Sr, a former mayor of Senegal\u2019s capital Dakar, used these payments to fund political campaigns in his homeland, as well as a lavish lifestyle in Monaco, where the IAAF is based.",

However, he also pointed out that it had not been easy in the cockpit, nor would there be any relaxation of his overwhelming desire to win. His authority is already stamped on the championship. Sebastian Vettel has fallen away and what threat Valtteri Bottas posed has faltered, perhaps irretrievably.</p> <p>What best illustrated just how hungry, how motivated Hamilton remains was his pursuit of the fastest lap at the close. He did not need the point, while in contrast Ferrari were chasing the consolation by switching Vettel to new softs at the death. Hamilton, on old hard rubber, almost took it, just two-hundredths slower. \u201cThere is never a moment you shouldn\u2019t be pushing and the moment you sit back is the moment you lose. And I don\u2019t plan on doing that,\u201d he said. He is positively relentless, unstoppable, F1\u2019s Terminator.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/23/lewis-hamilton-f1-\">Lewis Hamilton insists rule makers should ask drivers to help improve F1</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Russell on a roll </h2> <p>In a race largely bereft of action, it was a huge shame that George Russell\u2019s pass on his Williams\u2019 teammate Robert Kubica was not shown on TV. The young Briton has been wrestling courageously with his recalcitrant car all season and has had few chances to showcase the talent that took him to the F2 title last year. In France he did so. Russell went after Kubica through the Mistral chicane as the Pole defended the inside line, then took the better pace out of the corner as they re-entered the straight and went round Kubica at just under 200mph through the fearsomely quick, right-handed Signes corner. The pair came excruciatingly close as they exited, so much so that Russell gave out an exhalation of relief over team radio as he took the place.</p> <p>He described it as: \u201cQuite a hairy move but the highlight of my race\u201d. He ultimately finished last due to damage to his front wing, the first time this season he has done so, but can be rightly proud of having definitively proved his racing credentials.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7ae60262db84d6e873ff9c44ba9cc345919ac2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7ae60262db84d6e873ff9c44ba9cc345919ac2e/0_171_5142_3085/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George Russell of Williams has been wrestling courageously with his recalcitrant car all season but showed his potential with an overtaking move through the Mistral chicane.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Russell of Williams has been wrestling courageously with his recalcitrant car all season but showed his potential with an overtaking move through the Mistral chicane.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valdrin Xhemaj/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>McLaren take another step forward</h2> <p>How far things have come for McLaren from recent seasons when poor starts were compounded only by woe, wailing and doubtless considerable gnashing of teeth. Each race this year appears to display new reasons to praise the team who genuinely seem to have found their groove. This was the home race of Renault, who had targeted it as one at which to take the midfield lead. McLaren were having none of it. That Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz qualified in fifth and sixth was superlative. Then their race, which had looked like a nailed on sixth and seventh until Norris was scuppered by a hydraulics problem, had put Renault to the sword.</p> <p>On the grid a mechanic calmly had to make a tiny last minute repair to the right-rear floor of Norris\u2019s car, getting his fingers sticky with composite glue in the process. Effort and attention to detail at McLaren is bearing fruit and there will be no easy ride for Renault, who are, ironically, McLaren\u2019s engine suppliers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/24/lewis-hamilton-f1-governance-must-change-formula-one\">Lewis Hamilton: F1 governance must change after \u2018ugh\u2019 French Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Picture not perfect</h2> <p>Given that F1\u2019s owner\u2019s Liberty is a media company it seems curious it has still yet to really overhaul the pictures it broadcasts from the track. Broadcasters take the feed so are not to blame for some of the repeated complaints once again raised in France. In qualifying there is the issue of the feed covering the first car on a lap rather than switching to one that may have been behind but is clearly putting in a quicker time.

      "bodyText": "Hamilton relentlessly marches on Lewis Hamilton may have been almost apologetic after his dominant French Grand Prix win as he appealed for the drivers not be blamed when F1 served up an uninspiring afternoon. However, he also pointed out that it had not been easy in the cockpit, nor would there be any relaxation of his overwhelming desire to win. His authority is already stamped on the championship. Sebastian Vettel has fallen away and what threat Valtteri Bottas posed has faltered, perhaps irretrievably. What best illustrated just how hungry, how motivated Hamilton remains was his pursuit of the fastest lap at the close. He did not need the point, while in contrast Ferrari were chasing the consolation by switching Vettel to new softs at the death. Hamilton, on old hard rubber, almost took it, just two-hundredths slower. \u201cThere is never a moment you shouldn\u2019t be pushing and the moment you sit back is the moment you lose. And I don\u2019t plan on doing that,\u201d he said. He is positively relentless, unstoppable, F1\u2019s Terminator. Russell on a roll In a race largely bereft of action, it was a huge shame that George Russell\u2019s pass on his Williams\u2019 teammate Robert Kubica was not shown on TV. The young Briton has been wrestling courageously with his recalcitrant car all season and has had few chances to showcase the talent that took him to the F2 title last year. In France he did so. Russell went after Kubica through the Mistral chicane as the Pole defended the inside line, then took the better pace out of the corner as they re-entered the straight and went round Kubica at just under 200mph through the fearsomely quick, right-handed Signes corner. The pair came excruciatingly close as they exited, so much so that Russell gave out an exhalation of relief over team radio as he took the place. He described it as: \u201cQuite a hairy move but the highlight of my race\u201d. He ultimately finished last due to damage to his front wing, the first time this season he has done so, but can be rightly proud of having definitively proved his racing credentials. McLaren take another step forward How far things have come for McLaren from recent seasons when poor starts were compounded only by woe, wailing and doubtless considerable gnashing of teeth. Each race this year appears to display new reasons to praise the team who genuinely seem to have found their groove. This was the home race of Renault, who had targeted it as one at which to take the midfield lead. McLaren were having none of it. That Lando Norris and Carlos Sainz qualified in fifth and sixth was superlative. Then their race, which had looked like a nailed on sixth and seventh until Norris was scuppered by a hydraulics problem, had put Renault to the sword. On the grid a mechanic calmly had to make a tiny last minute repair to the right-rear floor of Norris\u2019s car, getting his fingers sticky with composite glue in the process. Effort and attention to detail at McLaren is bearing fruit and there will be no easy ride for Renault, who are, ironically, McLaren\u2019s engine suppliers. Picture not perfect Given that F1\u2019s owner\u2019s Liberty is a media company it seems curious it has still yet to really overhaul the pictures it broadcasts from the track. Broadcasters take the feed so are not to blame for some of the repeated complaints once again raised in France. In qualifying there is the issue of the feed covering the first car on a lap rather than switching to one that may have been behind but is clearly putting in a quicker time. Which means, as is often the case, Hamilton\u2019s pole lap was represented by the final seconds as he crossed the line. Then there are the lengthy start replays from multiple angles that often coincide with actual on-track action \u2013 on Sunday it was Vettel\u2019 s pass on Norris. Finally the question of just what action to cover was once again highlighted at the close at Paul Ricard: Norris trying to cling to his place, Charles Leclerc throwing himself at Bottas or Hamilton taking the flag. Pleasing everyone is impossible but there are options \u2013 Indycar already uses in-screen pictures to cover multiple plots. Money matter The agreement over new regulations for 2021 may have been delayed until October but before the French Grand Prix one change was finally agreed. The cost cap of $175m will be imposed in 2021 as part of the sport\u2019s new financial regulations. They were framed by the former Honda, Brawn and Mercedes financial director Nigel Kerr. It will require some cost cutting from the big three teams \u2013 Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull \u2013 but notable areas are not covered by the figure: costs associated with engines, driver salaries and marketing, all of which will still amount to substantial figures. The cap is also above what had been hoped for by the majority of smaller teams and there was a perception in the paddock in France that Liberty had allowed itself to be steamrollered into the higher number by the big three, not a ringing endorsement of its management or that it can play hard ball when required.",

The pilot of the third Eurofighter witnessed the collision and said he had seen two parachutes ejecting from the planes. In a press statement, the Luftwaffe denied rumours that the two jets had been armed with explosives, but nonetheless told the public to stay away from the crash sites.

The white paper on post-Brexit immigration policy, published in December, included a to-be-determined minimum salary threshold for high-skilled workers. The current minimum salary for most experienced workers coming from non-EU countries is \u00a330,000. Javid \u2013 after infighting within the cabinet over maintaining the current \u00a330,000 threshold for all high-skilled migrant workers coming to the UK post-Brexit, as well as warnings from business, universities and social care \u2013 has asked the government\u2019s chief migration advisers to review the levels before they come into force from 2021. He has also asked the migration advisory committee to consider if there was a case for regional salary thresholds for different parts of the UK, which would be of particular interest to the Scottish government, after it previously warned the cap could cut eligible EU workers in Scotland by 85%. Javid said: \u201cIt\u2019s vital the new immigration system continues to attract talented people to grow our economy and support business while controlling our borders. \u201cThese proposals are the biggest change to our immigration system in a generation, so it\u2019s right that we consider all of the evidence before finalising them. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve asked independent experts to review the evidence on salary thresholds. It\u2019s crucial the new immigration system works in the best interests of the whole of the UK.\u201d Last month, the environment secretary, Michael Gove, called on Javid to bring in flexible immigration rules for skilled workers after Brexit to avoid vacancies in certain industries. Gove criticised the \u00a330,000 salary threshold for immigrant workers, saying measuring whether someone qualified as skilled by their salary was not appropriate for all industries when he gave evidence at Holyrood\u2019s rural economy committee. Javid has asked the migration advisory committee to consider how future salary thresholds should be calculated; the levels of salary thresholds; whether there is a case for regional salary thresholds for different parts of the UK, and whether there should be exceptions to salary thresholds, for example because workers have newly started the occupation or because they work in an occupation in shortage. The committee is expected to present its findings in January 2020. The new immigration system would bring the end of free movement and EU citizens would be treated the same as non-EU citizens. The white paper contains an additional proposal to try to alleviate concerns about the new system: a transitional measure, to run for an initial five years, for low-skilled workers earning less than the threshold. This would allow people with lower-paid jobs to come to the UK for a maximum of 12 months, with a cooling-off period of a further 12 months to prevent people settling in the UK as a result.",

The name Libra comes from the basic Roman measurement of weight. The abbreviation lb for pound is derived from Libra, and the \u00a3 symbol originally comes from an ornate L in Libra.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Why is Facebook launching a cryptocurrency?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook claims it wants to reach the 1.7 billion people around the world who do not have access to a bank account.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Who is in charge of Libra?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook is likely to run into regulatory hurdles and antitrust concerns. The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland. Within the Libra Association will be a governing body called the Libra Association Council, comprised of a representative of each member of the association, which will vote on policy and operating decisions.</p>\n    <p>Facebook claims that although it created the Libra Association and the Libra Blockchain, once the currency is launched in 2020 the company will withdraw from a leadership role and all members of the association will have equal votes in governance of Libra. The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable. Facebook's original plans were that users could download Calibra, a digital wallet, that would allow them to send the currency to anyone with a smartphone. It is no longer clear which countries the coin will launch in first, if at all, though Facebook had said 'almost anybody' in the world with a smartphone would be able to download the app.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kari-paul\"><b>Kari Paul</b></a>&nbsp;in <i>San Francisco</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe publicity that the launch has once again brought to the space, combined with the legitimacy it offers, has understandably excited the community.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/23/global-markets-braced-for-turmoil-as-us-prepares-iran-sanctions\">Rising tensions in the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/23/global-markets-braced-for-turmoil-as-us-prepares-iran-sanctions\">Middle </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/23/global-markets-braced-for-turmoil-as-us-prepares-iran-sanctions\">East</a> and mounting fears about the world economy have also stoked renewed interest among investors in bitcoin, which is sometimes viewed as a safe-haven asset similar to gold.

      "bodyText": "The price of bitcoin has surged above $11,000 (\u00a38,600), its highest level in 15 months, amid renewed hype over cryptocurrencies after Facebook said it was planning to launch a digital currency next year. Bitcoin has risen in value by almost $2,000 in the week since the US technology firm revealed plans to create a cryptocurrency called Libra, in a move that could radically reshape the financial landscape with far-reaching implications for governments and central banks around the world. The original cryptocurrency had languished below $6,000 for much of this year and was falling out of the headlines as investors around the world gradually lost interest in the fad for digital assets. Some investors had been severely burned by bitcoin when its meteoric rise to almost $20,000 in late 2017 \u2013 which drew comparisons to the tulip mania of the 17th century \u2013 was followed by a spectacular collapse last year. Stoking fresh fears of the reinflation of the bubble, bitcoin hit $11,116.65 over the weekend, up from $8,539.81 at the start of June, before dropping back slightly to trade at about $10,800 on Monday afternoon. Analysts said the news of Facebook\u2019s work on Libra was the prime driver behind the surge, as traders bet the adoption of cryptocurrency technology by a major global corporation would help legitimise the industry. Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at the financial trading firm Oanda, said: \u201cBitcoin has slowly \u2013 by its own standards \u2013 been rising in recent months but the launch of Facebook\u2019s Libra has clearly been a catalyst for the recent surge. \u201cThe publicity that the launch has once again brought to the space, combined with the legitimacy it offers, has understandably excited the community.\u201d Rising tensions in the Middle East and mounting fears about the world economy have also stoked renewed interest among investors in bitcoin, which is sometimes viewed as a safe-haven asset similar to gold. The digital currency does not typically mirror the movements in wider financial markets during periods of turmoil. Gold prices have risen in recent weeks to the highest levels since 2013, as the US Federal Reserve could be forced into interest rate cuts to stave off a slowdown in the US economy. The European Central Bank has also said it could cut interest rates as growth falters in the eurozone. Unlike its run in 2017, which came largely from media hype stoking retail investors\u2019 interest in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin\u2019s tripling in value this year could have been the result of increased demand from professional investors such as fund managers and hedge funds. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week recorded an all-time high volume of trading in bitcoin derivatives contracts \u2013 sophisticated investments tracking the price of the digital currency only available to City banks and fund managers \u2013 with more than 5,000 contracts worth $250m. However regulators around the world have warned that Facebook\u2019s entry into the world of cryptocurrencies could lead to greater controls and tougher regulations to protect consumers. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, gave a cautious welcome to Libra last week. He said the central bank would support new entrants into the UK financial system, but warned that Facebook would need to meet the highest regulatory standards. \u201cThe Bank of England approaches Libra with an open mind but not an open door,\u201d he said. At the weekend the Bank for International Settlements warned that big tech firms using digital currencies could undermine the stability of a banking system that had only just recovered from the crash of 2008.

      "body": "<p>My friend John Hunt, who has died aged 71, was a teacher who rose to be the head of a prep school in Oxfordshire.</p> <p>One of John\u2019s proudest achievements was the publication of his book, Schooled for Life, in 2016. It presented a history of British educational policy and trends since the second world war, mixed in with his own experiences at school, both as a pupil and teacher. The book was scrupulously researched and its conclusions critical and thoughtful.</p> <p>John was born in Cheadle Hulme, Manchester, to Gerald, who was head of Wootton Bassett primary school in Wiltshire, and his wife, Marjorie (nee Golder), also a teacher. He attended Commonweal grammar school in Swindon, where the two of us met as pupils \u2013 I remember him as a something of a rebel who was outstanding on the sports field.</p> <p>After teacher training at Loughborough College, Leicestershire, John worked for many years at Cheltenham junior college, initially as a PE teacher and then as head of history and eventually deputy head. He moved on to become head of Ferndale preparatory school in Faringdon, Oxfordshire, in 1991, and stayed there until 2001, when he moved to be an education coordinator for the group of schools to which Faringdon belonged. He retired in 2007.</p> <p>In the social sphere John was humorous, sometimes acerbic and always loyal to his many friends, with whom he kept in regular touch. Telephone calls with him rarely lasted less than an hour, while he ranged over a wide variety of topics. His views on any subject were characterised by a dislike for hubris, arrogance and insularity. Letters were frequently sent and published in newspapers, and he corresponded with MPs to tell them the errors of their ways, particularly if they supported Brexit.</p> <p>John had many talents outside work. He wrote poems and played several musical instruments, was an accomplished artist and, with a prodigious ability to recall from memory, an outstanding contributor to any pub quiz night.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Sue (nee Hall), whom he married in 1970 and who worked as a bursar at Faringdon prep, by their children, Lucy and David, and grandchildren Ella, Lily and Tom. </p>",

      "bodyText": "My friend John Hunt, who has died aged 71, was a teacher who rose to be the head of a prep school in Oxfordshire. One of John\u2019s proudest achievements was the publication of his book, Schooled for Life, in 2016. It presented a history of British educational policy and trends since the second world war, mixed in with his own experiences at school, both as a pupil and teacher. The book was scrupulously researched and its conclusions critical and thoughtful. John was born in Cheadle Hulme, Manchester, to Gerald, who was head of Wootton Bassett primary school in Wiltshire, and his wife, Marjorie (nee Golder), also a teacher. He attended Commonweal grammar school in Swindon, where the two of us met as pupils \u2013 I remember him as a something of a rebel who was outstanding on the sports field. After teacher training at Loughborough College, Leicestershire, John worked for many years at Cheltenham junior college, initially as a PE teacher and then as head of history and eventually deputy head. He moved on to become head of Ferndale preparatory school in Faringdon, Oxfordshire, in 1991, and stayed there until 2001, when he moved to be an education coordinator for the group of schools to which Faringdon belonged. He retired in 2007. In the social sphere John was humorous, sometimes acerbic and always loyal to his many friends, with whom he kept in regular touch. Telephone calls with him rarely lasted less than an hour, while he ranged over a wide variety of topics. His views on any subject were characterised by a dislike for hubris, arrogance and insularity. Letters were frequently sent and published in newspapers, and he corresponded with MPs to tell them the errors of their ways, particularly if they supported Brexit. John had many talents outside work. He wrote poems and played several musical instruments, was an accomplished artist and, with a prodigious ability to recall from memory, an outstanding contributor to any pub quiz night. He is survived by his wife, Sue (nee Hall), whom he married in 1970 and who worked as a bursar at Faringdon prep, by their children, Lucy and David, and grandchildren Ella, Lily and Tom.",

Sajeel Shahid, who has repeatedly refused to be questioned by police about the attacks, set up Ummah Fitness Centre (UFC) and Ad-Deen primary school, both in Ilford, east London.

He told the inquest on Monday that the reason he refused to speak to police in the aftermath of the attack was because he was not involved and feared further vilification from the media. Shahid said he exchanged few words with Butt when the latter was working on the reception at the gym and had no social contact with him. \u201cHow am I supposed to know what he is thinking, what he is planning, what was in his mind?\u201d said Shahid, whose identity was hidden during his evidence. \u201cIf I ever knew he was capable of anything like this, I would have reported him to police and had him arrested.\u201d The court heard that in December 2016, January 2017 and May 2017 (Shahid was in the Netherlands in the interim months) there were 77 calls, 39 connected, between a number registered to Shahid and Butt\u2019s phone.

      "bodyText": "Authorities have urged children and older people to stay indoors and issued severe warnings against dehydration and heatstroke as an unprecedented week-long heatwave begins its advance across continental Europe. Meteorologists said temperatures would reach or even exceed 40C from Spain to Switzerland as hot air was sucked up from the Sahara by the combination of a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe. High humidity meant it would feel like 47C, experts warned. \u201cEl infierno [hell] is coming,\u201d tweeted the TV meteorologist Silvia Laplana in Spain, where the AEMET weather service forecast temperatures of 42C by Thursday in the Ebro, Tagus, Guadiana and Guadalquivir valleys and warned of an \u201cextreme risk\u201d of forest fires. In France, officials in Paris set up \u201ccool rooms\u201d in municipal buildings, opened pools for late-night swimming and installed extra drinking fountains as temperatures in the capital reached 34C on Monday and were forecast to climb further later in the week. \u201cI\u2019m worried about people who are downplaying this, who are continuing to exercise as usual or stay out in the sun,\u201d the health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, said. \u201cThis affects all of us, nobody is a superman when it comes to dealing with the extreme heat we\u2019re going to see on Thursday and Friday,\u201d she told a press conference. Emmanuel Dema\u00ebl of M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France said the heatwave was unprecedented \u201cbecause it\u2019s hitting so early in June \u2013 we haven\u2019t seen this since 1947.\u201d Record monthly and all-time highs were likely to be set in several parts of the country, Dema\u00ebl predicted, and night-time temperatures were unlikely to fall below 20C. School exams were postponed until next week, charities distributed water to homeless people and sales of fans quadrupled. France\u2019s deadliest recent heatwave was in August 2003, when almost 15,000 mainly elderly people died as hospitals were overwhelmed. In Italy, \u201cthe most intense heatwave in a decade\u201d was under way, with hospitals preparing to deal with a wave of heat-related illnesses and the health ministry suggesting army doctors may be needed to counter a shortage of medics. Highs of 37C to 40C were forecast across the north and centre, including in Rome, Florence, Bologna, Milan and Turin, with several Italian cities expected to set new records for the highest ever June temperatures. Authorities in Rome warned of the health risk from uncollected rubbish piled up on the capital\u2019s streets, and eight tourists \u2013 including a Briton \u2013 were fined \u20ac450 (\u00a3403) each on Sunday for cooling off in the city\u2019s fountains. Sabine Kr\u00fcger of the German state meteorological service, DWD, said the June record of 38.2C, set in Frankfurt in 1947, was likely to be beaten by the middle or end of this week, with 100 hours of sunshine forecast before Friday, temperatures in Frankfurt set to reach 39C or even 40C by Wednesday and Berlin predicted to swelter in 37C. DWD on Monday warned citizens to take extra precaution in view of the extreme heat and high UV radiation over the coming days: \u201cAvoid staying outdoors for long periods between 11am and 3pm,\u201d it said, adding that sunblock, sunglasses and a sun hat were advisable even in the shade. Animal protection groups also warned pet owners to avoid leaving dogs or cats in cars unattended. The heatwave comes after storms and record rainfall caused major problems in parts of Bavaria this weekend, with the Munich fire brigade called out 50 times and flights into and out of Munich airport suspended on Saturday evening. In Switzerland, MeteoSwiss issued a \u201csevere danger\u201d level four heat alert for several parts of the country, warning of temperatures in excess of 33C and reaching 37C or even 39C in some places from Tuesday until Thursday. A number of all-time highs were likely to be recorded, it said. Even Scandinavia looks unlikely to be spared, with parts of southern Denmark and Sweden predicted to reach 30C by Tuesday \u2013 and to feel more like a thoroughly un-Scandinavian 35C, the Danish broadcaster TV2 said. Longer range weather forecasts show summer temperatures throughout July and August are expected to be higher than normal this year, rivalling those of 2018, which according to the European Environment Agency was one of the three warmest years on record on the continent. Scientists have said last year\u2019s heatwave, which led to increased mortality rates, a dramatic decline in crop yields, the shutdown of nuclear power plants and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was linked to the climate emergency. Meteorologists warn that such heatwaves are likely to become more frequent even if countries succeed in their commitments to limit global temperature increases to 1.5C as part of the 2015 Paris climate accord. The EU has pledged to cut carbon emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. Additional reporting by Sam Jones, Angela Giuffrida and Philip Oltermann",

The University of London (UoL) spent more than \u00a31.3m on additional security officers, receptionists and other security measures from March 2018 until November last year, amid student demonstrations and over a dozen workers\u2019 strike days. The total until now is likely to be much higher for what protesters say has been the increasingly heavy policing of demonstrations in support of demands for the mainly migrant workers to be brought in-house under equal terms. Video footage has emerged from the second and final day of the occupation last week showing private security guards \u2013 whose company badges were concealed \u2013 removing protesters from Senate House. Asked upon what legal grounds they were being removed, a security guard is heard saying: \u201cWe don\u2019t need powers.\u201d He later said the protesters were trespassing, adding: \u201cThe university have asked us to remove you from the premises.\u201d Ross Tayler, a master\u2019s student at University College London, said: \u201cWe were dragged down the fire escape stairs.

They had blocked all exits to the Chancellor\u2019s Hall, ignored a genuine fire alarm and were in breach of our visitor regulations. \u201cThe university was in very regular contact with the student group throughout the occupation. The students were offered a meeting with the vice-chancellor to discuss their demands but did not take up this opportunity.\u201d",

Having seen their club endure 12 years of mostly downward drift under the stewardship of spivvy blowhard billionaire Mike Ashley, a month ago they found themselves daring to dream as news broke of yet another potential takeover. And not just any potential takeover \u2013 oh no! This one was being spearheaded by an apparently ambitious sheikh whose family is purported to be worth around \u00a3150bn. While it is easy to understand the unbridled optimism of Geordies absolutely desperate to rid their club of an owner with no apparent interest in owning their club, neutrals could be forgiven for smirking knowingly at preposterously premature, euphoric talk of what kind of bells and whistles the club would employ when the time came to \u201c<em>Announce Mbapp\u00e9!</em>\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/rafael-benitez-leaving-newcastle-contract-expires-30-june\">Rafael Ben\u00edtez to leave Newcastle when contract expires on Sunday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever about talk of takeovers \u2013 as many as three different ones are currently progressing with glacier-like speed \u2013 on Monday a more monotonously predictable announcement was made by Newcastle, who confirmed the worst fears of supporters by releasing a statement saying that manager and firm fan favourite Rafael Ben\u00edtez will not be renewing his contract when it expires on Sunday. \u201cWe have worked hard to extend Rafa\u2019s contract over a significant period of time,\u201d parped a statement, referring to the tireless efforts they put into reportedly offering him a one-year deal on no extra money, with precisely no additional assurances that he would be given funds to improve the team.</p> <p>Hoping for a Ronaldo but now unlikely to even hold on to a Rond\u00f3n, Newcastle fans are understandably enraged by the latest act of inertia by a bawdy banter-merchant whose enthusiasm for challenging insubordinates to drinking contests and subsequently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/03/sports-direct-founder-pubs-mike-ashley\">chundering his guts up into pub fireplaces</a> outweighs his desire to propel Newcastle up the Premier League table. Ashley is 54 years old.</p> <p>With one of the best managers Newcastle have ever had in demand by Chinese club Dalian Yifang, whose owner has offered to double his wages, Ben\u00edtez will be OK, but what the future holds for Newcastle\u2019s long-suffering supporters remains unclear. The Fiver\u2019s predicting more misery, more uncertainty and some big decisions to be made as the deadline looms for season ticket renewals. To pick a random animal, you can only punch a police horse so often before it rears up and lashes back in anger and even the patience of some of the most devoted fans in England must be wearing gossamer thin. In the meantime, whoever runs the Netflix Twitter account had some sage advice for Geordies in need of a pick-me-up on yet another gloomy day in their recent history. \u201cIf there\u2019s any Newcastle fans who want cheering up,\u201d they said, \u201chere\u2019s a quick reminder that Sunderland Til I Die is still streaming on Netflix UK and Ireland.\u201d</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Beau Dure at 5pm BST for Spain 0-4 USA!

      "bodyText": "TOON GLOOM Who\u2019d be a Newcastle fan? Having seen their club endure 12 years of mostly downward drift under the stewardship of spivvy blowhard billionaire Mike Ashley, a month ago they found themselves daring to dream as news broke of yet another potential takeover. And not just any potential takeover \u2013 oh no! This one was being spearheaded by an apparently ambitious sheikh whose family is purported to be worth around \u00a3150bn. While it is easy to understand the unbridled optimism of Geordies absolutely desperate to rid their club of an owner with no apparent interest in owning their club, neutrals could be forgiven for smirking knowingly at preposterously premature, euphoric talk of what kind of bells and whistles the club would employ when the time came to \u201cAnnounce Mbapp\u00e9!\u201d Whatever about talk of takeovers \u2013 as many as three different ones are currently progressing with glacier-like speed \u2013 on Monday a more monotonously predictable announcement was made by Newcastle, who confirmed the worst fears of supporters by releasing a statement saying that manager and firm fan favourite Rafael Ben\u00edtez will not be renewing his contract when it expires on Sunday. \u201cWe have worked hard to extend Rafa\u2019s contract over a significant period of time,\u201d parped a statement, referring to the tireless efforts they put into reportedly offering him a one-year deal on no extra money, with precisely no additional assurances that he would be given funds to improve the team. Hoping for a Ronaldo but now unlikely to even hold on to a Rond\u00f3n, Newcastle fans are understandably enraged by the latest act of inertia by a bawdy banter-merchant whose enthusiasm for challenging insubordinates to drinking contests and subsequently chundering his guts up into pub fireplaces outweighs his desire to propel Newcastle up the Premier League table. Ashley is 54 years old. With one of the best managers Newcastle have ever had in demand by Chinese club Dalian Yifang, whose owner has offered to double his wages, Ben\u00edtez will be OK, but what the future holds for Newcastle\u2019s long-suffering supporters remains unclear. The Fiver\u2019s predicting more misery, more uncertainty and some big decisions to be made as the deadline looms for season ticket renewals. To pick a random animal, you can only punch a police horse so often before it rears up and lashes back in anger and even the patience of some of the most devoted fans in England must be wearing gossamer thin. In the meantime, whoever runs the Netflix Twitter account had some sage advice for Geordies in need of a pick-me-up on yet another gloomy day in their recent history. \u201cIf there\u2019s any Newcastle fans who want cheering up,\u201d they said, \u201chere\u2019s a quick reminder that Sunderland Til I Die is still streaming on Netflix UK and Ireland.\u201d LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Beau Dure at 5pm BST for Spain 0-4 USA! USA!! USA!!! and Simon Burnton at 8pm for coverage of Sweden 2-1 Canada in the last 16 of the World Cup. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever play in another game like that\u201d \u2013 England\u2019s Jill Scott keeps it simple when trying to sum up the mind-bogglingly chaotic scenes during England\u2019s 3-0 World Cup win over Cameroon. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe nominative determinism: a good spot by Robert Heath re Bonsegundo. In the early days of Pan American Airways (PanAm) they only had a single route (between Key West, Florida and Havana, Cuba). PanAm\u2019s chief suit\u2019s name was Juan Trippe\u201d \u2013 Mark Robinson. \u201cOccasionally I notice in your screed that there is a Stop Football movement in England. No further effort needed. VAR is doing it for you\u201d \u2013 Dale Chase. \u201cHow did we manage to go through Van Gaal\u2019s wonderful young generation of Ajax players in the mid-90s, his painfully dysfunctional years at Barcelona (largely with the same Ajax players) and the astonishingly dull Manchester United years without knowing that his name isn\u2019t actually Louis, it is Aloysius Paulus (the article is in Spanish but it\u2019s in the first line of the piece under the picture). He should be a Caesar (imperial Roman leader not dog food) with that name\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is Mark Robsinson. RECOMMENDED LISTENING Get your ears around Football Weekly here! NEWS, BITS AND BOBS England fans have told how they were escorted from the ground following the 3-0 defeat of Cameroon after tensions flared in the crowd. Like Whitney Houston before her, Marta believes the children are our future. Well, Brazil\u2019s future, to be precise. \u201cWomen\u2019s football depends on you to survive \u2013 value it more!\u201d she roared after Brazil\u2019s 2-1 defeat by France. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for support \u2026 there\u2019s not going to be a Formiga forever, there\u2019s not going to be a Marta forever.\u201d Ed the Red has rustled up a bit more cash and tabled an improved offer for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, meaning suits from Manchester United and Crystal Palace will meet to fine-tune a deal to take the full-back to Old Trafford. Mallorca have been promoted to La Liga by beating Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a 3-2 on aggregate in a play-off. And no, not even The Fiver\u2019s siesta-taking, castanet-clacking Spanish cousin Juan Miguel Manuel Ole! Ole! Ole! Fiver knows why it was played yonks after the season ended. Argentina are into the Copa Am\u00e9rica quarter-finals after a Sergio Ag\u00fcero-inspired 2-0 defeat of South American heavyweights \u2026 oh, Qatar. And Maurizio Sarri has had a pop at (not so) Big Paper. \u201cThe English media is made up of big newspapers and then the tabloids on an inferior level,\u201d he swiped. \u201cIt fortifies you but what disappointed me was that in Italy people only reported the attacks of the tabloids and not the more prestigious and reliable newspapers like The Times.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? England proved their appetite for the fight against Cameroon but Norway will have seen enough to be optimistic for the quarter-final, so says Louise Taylor. The Indomitable Lionesses\u2019 childish antics undid their positive work in the group stage in emphatic fashion, according to Suzanne Wrack. Super-Mr 20% Mino Raiola is a player\u2019s dream and a manager\u2019s nightmare, writes Richard Williams. Jacob Steinberg reckons Manchester United\u2019s fruitless search for a director of football means players are thinking twice about taking Ed the Red\u2019s millions. Six Months after South Africa won the 1996 Rugby World Cup on home soil they repeated the trick at the Africa Cup of Nations. Ian Hawkey has the lowdown. Mauritania make their Afcon debut on Monday night, only seven years after they were ranked the fourth worst team in the world. Paul Doyle tells the story of a desert football revolution.

If the price of Johnson proves to be Corbyn, blame will rest with the Conservative party, which is about to foist a tasteless joke upon the British people \u2013 who will not find it funny for long. \u2022 Max Hastings is a former editor of the Daily Telegraph and the London Evening Standard",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sceptics in the audience also questioned the cost, the legality and the support the EU or Irish government would offer for alternative proposals.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are no solutions offered for VAT, state aid or providing market access.

Shanker Singham said he was given this advice by a community representative recently when in the Creggan estate in Derry, where the journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead in April. Singham is the chairman of the alternative arrangements commission (AAC) technical group, which published a 200-page report on Monday examining options for keeping the Irish border invisible after Brexit. The AAC has made eight recommendations for alternative arrangements, which it says could be ready within three years. If correct and accepted by the EU it would mean the backstop would not be needed after 2022. Singham said he was able to assure the Derry communities that one of the AAC\u2019s central proposals was to create special economic zones stretching to 30 miles (48km) either side of the border. Within these areas there would be free movement of goods and people, meaning no checks. The report was welcomed by many critics of Brexit in Northern Ireland but was described as three years too late. Former Tory defence secretary Michael Fallon said the UK should have acted more responsibly at the start. \u201cWe should have made a much more generous offer to Ireland immediately after the referendum,\u201d because it was most impacted by the vote. Sources at the EU said that the AAC was not a government organisation and the backstop remained the only solution on the table. It added however it would stand by this agreement to work on alternative solutions, which meet the same objectives in the withdrawal agreement. Neil McDonnell, the chief executive of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprise Association (Isme), commended Singham for engaging on the detail but said the report would have been far better if it came in March or April 2016, before the EU referendum. \u201cIt would have shown voters this was not a binary decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThe beauty of this report is it shows the complete bedlam that will be caused by Brexit.\u201d He said the debate about alternative arrangements was like \u201can internal conversation among Brexiters\u201d, and many still did not understand the costs that Brexit checks would add for ordinary businesses, operating on margins sometimes of less than 1%. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear all this stuff is feasible in five years if we are all out of business by then,\u201d he said. McDonnell told a special conference on the Irish border on Monday that 80% of Northern Ireland micro-businesses \u2013 those that employ fewer than 10 people \u2013 export only to the Republic of Ireland, and could be adversely affected by the cost of customs and other checks.

The team said the link could be down to the way these bacteria break down lactate, a substance linked to fatigue during exercise. Lactate is created when the body uses glucose to produce energy under limited levels of oxygen. \u201cWe have shown that the microbiome may be a critical component of physical performance,\u201d the authors wrote. However, others said it was too soon to say whether these bacteria would indeed aid performance in humans. Prof George Church of Harvard University, a co-author of the study, agreed but said clinical trials in humans would be conducted. However, if performance-boosting effects were to be found, this could create difficult questions about how to regulate athletes\u2019 use of microbes or the substances they produce, he said. While previous studies suggested athletes might show differences in the makeup of the community of microbes in their gut \u2013 the gut microbiome \u2013 compared with non-athletes, the impact of these differences has been unclear.

Athletes gave stool samples both the week before the race \u2013 when they would be expected to do little running \u2013 and the week after the race. The team found that Veillonella bacteria were more abundant in athletes after they had run the race than before \u2013 although overall there was little difference in abundance on average between athletes and non-athletes. Similar changes were found in the analysis of stool samples from a further 87 athletes taken both before and after exercise, with the researchers also finding a post-exercise boost in the relative abundance of genes linked to the pathway by which Veillonella break down lactate. To test whether Veillonella could produce an improvement in athletic ability, the team turned to mice.

      "bodyText": "Poland\u2019s lowering of the retirement age for judges breaches EU law, the European court of justice has said, in a victory for civil society campaigners seeking to preserve democratic values. The ruling from Europe\u2019s highest court, released on Monday, is a blow to Poland\u2019s nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government, which has drastically increased control over the judiciary in recent years. It will also be a disappointment for Hungary\u2019s government, which is also in the EU dock over the rule of law and has made representations to the court in Poland\u2019s favour. Since taking office in 2015 PiS has assumed direct oversight of state prosecutors and the judicial body that appoints, promotes and disciplines judges. In 2018 the government introduced a law to force the retirement of 40% of supreme court judges. That measure has now been ruled as inconsistent with the EU fundamental values of democracy and the rule of law. In a statement the court said that lowering the retirement age of judges to the supreme court was \u201cnot justified by a legitimate objective and undermines the principle of the irremovability of judges, that principle being essential to their independence\u201d. The court also referred to Poland\u2019s obligations under the charter of fundamental rights and EU treaty article 2, which states that the union is founded on values, including democracy and the rule of law. Lawyers for the Polish government had argued in court that the law was intended to bring judges\u2019 retirement ages in line with those of the general population. The measure was introduced after President Andrzej Duda rejected an earlier plan that would have instantly dismissed those permitted to serve by the minister of justice, following mass street protests. Duda, a former member of PiS, made his own proposal a few months later to lower the age of retirement from 70 to 65, and the measures came into force last April. The law meant 40% of Polish supreme court judges had to retire early or apply to Duda to stay in post. The head of the Polish supreme court, Ma\u0142gorzata Gersdorf, along with 10 other judges, refused to file an application to the president on the grounds that the law violated constitutional provisions on judicial independence. The ECJ decision will be welcome news to most other EU member states, who are embroiled in a complex and slow-moving exchange with the Polish government over the rule of law. In 2016 Brussels launched an investigation into Poland\u2019s increasing controls on the judiciary \u2013 the first time the European commission deployed its rule of law procedure, which could lead to the country stripped of its right to vote. But the process has become bogged down in the EU council of ministers, with some countries reluctant to criticise a fellow government. Many diplomats hope the ECJ will solve the conflict over the rule of law in Poland through its rulings, obviating any confrontation between Warsaw and other member states. Poland has now been ordered to pay the costs of the case, while Hungary will bear the bill for its time in court.",

The party\u2019s economics spokesman, Toni Rold\u00e1n, announced on Monday that he was leaving Citizens and renouncing his seat in the Spanish parliament in protest at the party\u2019s drift to the right and its willingness to enter alliances with the far right after regional and municipal elections. Rold\u00e1n is the latest figure to publicly question the wisdom of vacating the centre as Citizens tries to stake its claim to being Spain\u2019s main opposition party. The former French prime minister Manuel Valls, who Citizens had backed in his unsuccessful bid to become mayor of Barcelona, had repeatedly urged the party to have nothing to do with the upstart far-right Vox party. But it ignored his pleas and has enlisted Vox\u2019s help in building coalitions with the conservative People\u2019s party to rule the southern region of Andaluc\u00eda and run Madrid\u2019s city council. \u201cFor a while now, the leadership of the party to which I belong has taken a strategic decision, which is legitimate, but which is one I do not agree with,\u201d said Rold\u00e1n. \u201cI\u2019ve expressed my disagreement at every opportunity \u2026 but I haven\u2019t been successful.

Last week, Valls also attacked Citizens, lamenting its failure to live up to its values. \u201cWhen I moved to Barcelona a year ago, Citizens was a liberal, progressive, centrist and pro-European party,\u201d he said. \u201cBut, little by little, the party with which I had so much in common began to change into something different.\u201d Valls said Citizens had become a party that did deals with Vox \u2013 \u201ca reactionary and anti-European party\u201d.

Three days after arriving in the city, Kwei-Armah recalls finding out Elba had won a Golden Globe for his Wire role. \u201cI remember sitting in my cousin\u2019s yard, and I texted him, just going, \u2018Bruv, man is just so proud of you\u2019 and not expecting to get anything back. [But] straight back, bam, Idris is like \u2018Thank you brother.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It was on returning to Baltimore, to direct Soul: The Stax Musical in 2018, that Kwei-Armah listened to Mi Mandela again. \u201cI got all goosebumpy,\u201d he says. \u201cMy mother had died, and my mother was my everything, so [when] Idris began to speak about his father, and his connection with the universe through this thing \u2026\u201d He trails off. \u201cI went, \u2018Come we go.

      "body": "<p>A group of 25 British and Dutch military veterans are to join the first excavation of the main field hospital established by the Duke of Wellington during the Battle of Waterloo.</p> <p>The former soldiers, sailors and RAF personnel will work with archaeologists, led by Prof Tony Pollard of Glasgow University, to explore the farm buildings of Mont-St-Jean, where thousands of wounded soldiers received primitive first aid as shot and shell rained down on them.</p> <p>The dig has been organised by Waterloo Uncovered, a charity founded by two Coldstream Guards officers, Charles Foinette and Mark Evans, who suffered from PTSD after a tour in Afghanistan.</p> <p>The project seeks to combine world-class archeology with support for veterans. In 2015, the charity\u2019s excavation of the battle site at Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Hougoumont, the farmhouse defended by the Coldstream Guards, discovered musket balls from some of the first shots exchanged between the French and allied troops and evidence of the close-quarters fighting.</p> <p>Napoleon had instructed the French army in June 1815 to seize Wellington\u2019s position on the Mont-St-Jean Ridge, a few miles from Brussels.</p> <p>\u201cOnce the cannons opened fire, the farm buildings rapidly overflowed with the wounded,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cMont-St-Jean became a place of suffering and endurance. It\u2019s possible that as many as 6,000 casualties passed through the place.</p> <p>\u201cMany men died there. The site has never been excavated before. As an archaeologist this is a unique opportunity to look for evidence of the battle to save lives.\u201d</p> <p>It is hoped the site around the field hospital, where medics operated without anaesthetic, amputating shattered limbs and suturing wounds, will reveal secrets of the effort to save lives during and after the fighting.</p> <p>The Waterloo battle site does not have a cemetery but is marked by a museum and monument. The dead, apart from a few officers, were either burned or buried in unmarked graves, with the bones taken as souvenirs or used by local farmers for fertiliser.</p> <p>Evans said: \u201cIt will be thought-provoking and moving to be excavating on the site of the field hospital. Some of our team have themselves experienced battlefield first aid.</p> <p>\u201cThe men of 1815 would have hoped for very little.

      "bodyText": "A group of 25 British and Dutch military veterans are to join the first excavation of the main field hospital established by the Duke of Wellington during the Battle of Waterloo. The former soldiers, sailors and RAF personnel will work with archaeologists, led by Prof Tony Pollard of Glasgow University, to explore the farm buildings of Mont-St-Jean, where thousands of wounded soldiers received primitive first aid as shot and shell rained down on them. The dig has been organised by Waterloo Uncovered, a charity founded by two Coldstream Guards officers, Charles Foinette and Mark Evans, who suffered from PTSD after a tour in Afghanistan. The project seeks to combine world-class archeology with support for veterans. In 2015, the charity\u2019s excavation of the battle site at Ch\u00e2teau d\u2019Hougoumont, the farmhouse defended by the Coldstream Guards, discovered musket balls from some of the first shots exchanged between the French and allied troops and evidence of the close-quarters fighting. Napoleon had instructed the French army in June 1815 to seize Wellington\u2019s position on the Mont-St-Jean Ridge, a few miles from Brussels. \u201cOnce the cannons opened fire, the farm buildings rapidly overflowed with the wounded,\u201d Pollard said. \u201cMont-St-Jean became a place of suffering and endurance. It\u2019s possible that as many as 6,000 casualties passed through the place. \u201cMany men died there. The site has never been excavated before. As an archaeologist this is a unique opportunity to look for evidence of the battle to save lives.\u201d It is hoped the site around the field hospital, where medics operated without anaesthetic, amputating shattered limbs and suturing wounds, will reveal secrets of the effort to save lives during and after the fighting. The Waterloo battle site does not have a cemetery but is marked by a museum and monument. The dead, apart from a few officers, were either burned or buried in unmarked graves, with the bones taken as souvenirs or used by local farmers for fertiliser. Evans said: \u201cIt will be thought-provoking and moving to be excavating on the site of the field hospital. Some of our team have themselves experienced battlefield first aid. \u201cThe men of 1815 would have hoped for very little. Many of those who survived returned to an uncertain future because of their injuries. The care and recovery process has changed so much today.\u201d Among the group working on the site from July will be military personnel who have been wounded, or suffer from post-traumatic stress after action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Their ages range from 19 \u2013 a soldier serving in the Coldstream Guards who is recuperating from training injuries \u2013 to mid-70s. The field hospital at Mont-St-Jean was 600 metres north of the frontline. A plaque marks the work of the surgeons of the Royal Army Medical Corps, whose patients included the Prince of Orange and Wellington\u2019s military secretary, Lt-Col Lord FitzRoy Somerset, who had his arm amputated. Describing the scenes, William Gibney, the assistant surgeon of the 15th Hussars, recalled: \u201cNothing could exceed the misery exhibited on this road \u2026 Here a man with an arm suspended only by a single muscle, another with his head horribly mangled by a sabre cut, or one with half his face shot away.\u201d The inclusion of eight Dutch military veterans was welcomed by Col Ludy de Vos of the Dutch Veterans\u2019 Institute, who spoke of his country\u2019s pride in its place in the battle of Waterloo. De Vos said: \u201cWe\u2019re delighted for Dutch military personnel to be standing alongside British and international colleagues at a site so important to European history.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The British journalist John Francis Lane, who has died aged 89, provided a vivid running commentary on Italian cinema for more than half a century, from the last great years of neorealism up to the present.

In Fellini\u2019s Roma (1972), when the camera is threading through a hubbub of diners in the street, a voice is heard to say: \u201cThat\u2019s the American writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/01/gore-vidal-dies\" title=\"\">Gore Vidal</a> over there \u2013 let\u2019s talk to him.\u201d</p> <p>And there he is, sharing a table with a long-haired Lane, also playing himself. By the time of Roma, Lane had known Fellini for more than a decade. In one of their encounters, he had managed to appropriate a pad of the master\u2019s notepaper with each page headed by Fellini\u2019s self-portrait caricature \u2013 Fellini was kinder to himself in this respect than he sometimes was to others.</p> <p>His caricature of Lane showed the critic naked, portly and with an anatomically fixed peacock\u2019s feather waving behind him. Favoured acquaintances might receive an occasional letter from Lane on a stolen sheet of Fellini\u2019s personal stationery, which he eked out and conferred on friends like parodic honours for the rest of his life.</p> <p>What had brought him and Fellini together was La Dolce Vita (1960) in which Lane played one of the reporters attending a press conference given by the glamorous Sylvia, the role through which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/11/anita-ekberg\" title=\"\">Anita Ekberg</a> achieved filmic immortality by wading exuberantly in the Trevi fountain. He and Fellini had established a friendly relationship during the filming and the director asked him to prepare an English-language version of the script and to supervise the film\u2019s dubbing into English.</p> <p>When they met in London at that time, Lane asked Fellini why he put so many \u201cfreaks\u201d into his films. \u201cCaro Francescone [Dear big Francis],\u201d Fellini replied, \u201clook around you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAt least,\u201d Lane recalled, \u201che didn\u2019t tell me to look in the mirror.\u201d</p> <p>Freak was a word that Lane used without apparent bitterness to describe his own position as an outsider, as someone living in opposition to the conventions of the English middle-class life into which he had been born.</p> <p>Much later, he provisionally gave one of several attempts at autobiography the title A Freak in Rome. He explained that he would try to recall the three main activities of his adult life: the first, as a film and theatre critic, columnist and actor; the second, as a middle-class Englishman who had set out to discover the riches of Italian culture; and the third, \u201cas a shameless homosexual enjoying the joys and sorrows of Italian male company\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6ae6dd7081eb7d4da2464a835dd837cea05c224\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6ae6dd7081eb7d4da2464a835dd837cea05c224/0_0_938_1388/676.jpg\" alt=\"John Francis Lane\u2019s autobiography, To Each His Own Dolce Vita, came out in 2013.

In the end, when the autobiography appeared in 2013, although frank enough, it carried the calmer, kinder title <a href=\"http://www.fsgso.pitt.edu/2013/05/book-review-to-each-his-own-dolce-vita/\" title=\"\">To Each His Own Dolce Vita</a>.</p> <p>So far as it went, Lane had a good education, the main part of it taking place against the background of the second world war. He was born in Tankerton, a suburb of Whitstable in Kent, into a comfortably off middle-class family. He had been sent first to a school in London which was evacuated at the outbreak of the war. He then became a boarder at the Royal grammar school in Worcester, followed towards the end of the war by Dulwich college, London. His father died in 1943 and Lane persuaded his mother to let him leave after only a year and enrol in drama school in Highgate.</p> <p>He gained experience in both acting and directing at the school, and had a spell as a stage manager in the West End. In early 1948 he signed up to study French at the Sorbonne in Paris and enrolled on a film course at the young but already prestigious Idhec \u2013 l\u2019Institut des Hautes \u00c9tudes Cin\u00e9matographiques. He first visited Italy as a tourist from Paris, in 1949, and studied Italian at the University of Florence before settling in Rome in 1951.</p> <p>There he lived for 46 years, surviving initially on a small legacy, then through a routine job with the FAO, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation. At the same time, he was involved in the more congenial task of trying to build an income as a stringer for several Fleet Street papers.</p> <p>He had arrived with a confirmed passion for Italian cinema, and had already contributed his first article, on Idhec itself, to the British Film Institute\u2019s periodical, Sight &amp; Sound. He became the correspondent of the monthly Films and Filming from its first issue, in 1954, and continued to write for it until the early 1980s. Subsequently, he was the Rome correspondent of Screen International, contributing to it from 1985 until the mid-90s. Then a street accident made it difficult for him to climb the stairs to his beloved attic apartment and effectively ended his long sojourn in the capital.</p> <p>His own direct involvement in the movie business had begun in the winter of 1956 when he met David Hanna, who was then working as a film publicist in Cinecitt\u00e0, and asked Lane to stand in for him. </p> <p>Suddenly, he found himself inside the world he had observed only as an outsider, and before long the invitations to play cameo roles started to arrive. Only rarely in the coming years did his dual career as reporter and actor cause problems. One such occasion came when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-burton\" title=\"\">Richard Burton</a> vetoed his presence on the set of Cleopatra (1963), the backdrop to Burton\u2019s \u201ctumultuous\u201d (in publicist\u2019s parlance) love affair with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/mar/23/elizabeth-taylor-obituary\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a>. By then Lane was in demand, partly perhaps for the very reason that his presence promised publicity. One of his last appearances was as a cardinal in Liliana Cavani\u2019s Francesco (1989), a life of St Francis starring Mickey Rourke.</p> <p>During the 60s, he also made occasional appearances in the theatre. In 1963, the year before <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/alt.obituaries/yn4-FbxjKO8\" title=\"\">Peter Daubeny</a> launched the first of his wonderful World Theatre seasons at the Aldwych, London, Lane helped him bring the Italian actor <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vittorio-Gassman\" title=\"\">Vittorio Gassman</a> to London.</p> <p>This was a huge success, and Lane continued to collaborate with Daubeny over Italian contributions to his Aldwych seasons in the following years. In his autobiography, My World of Theatre (1971), Daubeny pays warm tribute to him. Lane\u2019s close friendship with the Neapolitan actor and playwright Eduardo de Filippo, to whom he also introduced Daubeny, helped him to bring De Filippo to London in 1972 to star in one of his most famous plays, Napoli Milionaria.</p> <p>Lane continued to play the role of creative go-between throughout his career. For example, he introduced the film director Michael Radford to the Neapolitan actor Massimo Troisi who starred \u2013 in his last role \u2013 in Radford\u2019s Oscar-nominated Il Postino (1994).</p> <p>In 1970 Lane translated into Italian Samuel Beckett\u2019s Not I and coached Laura Betti for her performance of it in the Rome Municipal theatre \u2013 something he mentioned in passing in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/aug/07/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries\" title=\"\">her obituary, which he wrote for the Guardian in 2004</a>, 30 years after his first contribution to the paper \u2013 a survey of recent Italian movies headed \u201cRome still makes masterpieces for the cinema\u201d.</p> <p>In retirement Lane lived in the town of Rende, in Calabria, in a flat in the home and within the extended family of an Italian friend who offered him, he would tell friends, the affection and protection he said he had never found in his years of \u201cRoman philandering\u201d. From there, he wrote frequently on Italian life for the Economist. He also wrote reviews and reflections for Il Quotidiano, the daily newspaper in nearby Cosenza.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-francis-lane\" title=\"\">Some 60 of his obituaries</a>, almost all of leading figures from Italian cinema and theatre, have preceded his own on this page in the Guardian. It was the most recent of these, that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/15/franco-zeffirelli-obituary\" title=\"\">Franco Zeffirelli</a>, that prompted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/18/letter-john-francis-lane\" title=\"\">the belated news from Italy</a> that he had died there more than a year ago, latterly living quietly enclosed in a country, and a community, that had truly become his own. He had a rare and deep appreciation of Italy\u2019s cultural life and never tired of commending it to others.</p> <p>\u2022 John Francis Lane, critic, journalist and actor, born 1 December 1928; died 15 January 2018</p>",

During the 60s, he also made occasional appearances in the theatre. In 1963, the year before Peter Daubeny launched the first of his wonderful World Theatre seasons at the Aldwych, London, Lane helped him bring the Italian actor Vittorio Gassman to London. This was a huge success, and Lane continued to collaborate with Daubeny over Italian contributions to his Aldwych seasons in the following years. In his autobiography, My World of Theatre (1971), Daubeny pays warm tribute to him. Lane\u2019s close friendship with the Neapolitan actor and playwright Eduardo de Filippo, to whom he also introduced Daubeny, helped him to bring De Filippo to London in 1972 to star in one of his most famous plays, Napoli Milionaria. Lane continued to play the role of creative go-between throughout his career. For example, he introduced the film director Michael Radford to the Neapolitan actor Massimo Troisi who starred \u2013 in his last role \u2013 in Radford\u2019s Oscar-nominated Il Postino (1994). In 1970 Lane translated into Italian Samuel Beckett\u2019s Not I and coached Laura Betti for her performance of it in the Rome Municipal theatre \u2013 something he mentioned in passing in her obituary, which he wrote for the Guardian in 2004, 30 years after his first contribution to the paper \u2013 a survey of recent Italian movies headed \u201cRome still makes masterpieces for the cinema\u201d. In retirement Lane lived in the town of Rende, in Calabria, in a flat in the home and within the extended family of an Italian friend who offered him, he would tell friends, the affection and protection he said he had never found in his years of \u201cRoman philandering\u201d. From there, he wrote frequently on Italian life for the Economist. He also wrote reviews and reflections for Il Quotidiano, the daily newspaper in nearby Cosenza. Some 60 of his obituaries, almost all of leading figures from Italian cinema and theatre, have preceded his own on this page in the Guardian. It was the most recent of these, that of Franco Zeffirelli, that prompted the belated news from Italy that he had died there more than a year ago, latterly living quietly enclosed in a country, and a community, that had truly become his own. He had a rare and deep appreciation of Italy\u2019s cultural life and never tired of commending it to others. \u2022 John Francis Lane, critic, journalist and actor, born 1 December 1928; died 15 January 2018",

After four years with his hometown club, he was on his way from Amsterdam to join Foggia in the first of Mino Raiola\u2019s many significant transnational deals between football clubs. The previous evening, when Ajax had played Feyenoord, a fan held up a hand-lettered placard. \u201cBryan bedankt,\u201d it said. Thanks, Bryan.</p> <p>Not always have football fans expressed such gratitude on the departure of one of Raiola\u2019s clients. This summer, depending on how things work out, Manchester United\u2019s supporters are unlikely to send Paul Pogba on his way with warm wishes for a successful future in Madrid or Turin. The prospect of that \u00a3100m-plus deal became more likely last week when, during a promotional visit to Japan, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/16/paul-pogba-manchester-united-new-challenge-good-time-transfer-real-madrid-juventus\" title=\"\">French midfielder volunteered his readiness to accept a \u201cnew challenge\u201d</a> away from Old Trafford. Some might think that helping Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to rescue a great club from the doldrums represents enough of a challenge for anyone, but that would not be Raiola\u2019s way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/apr/07/paul-pogba-mino-raiola-pep-guardiola\">Paul Pogba left exposed by Mino Raiola\u2019s war of words with Pep Guardiola | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A controversial figure, particularly in Manchester, where he is detested by both Alex Ferguson (who once called him a \u201ctwat\u201d during face-to-face negotiations) and Pep Guardiola, the agent is free to negotiate on Pogba\u2019s behalf only because the court of arbitration for sport upheld his appeal against a worldwide three-month ban from all football activities imposed by Fifa in May. The sanction was first imposed by the FIGC, the Italian football association, but the nature of the alleged irregularities was never officially disclosed.</p> <p>On the other hand, Ajax may yet be grateful for the agent\u2019s part in negotiating <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/22/juventus-edge-ahead-psg-matthijs-de-ligt-transfer\" title=\"\">a supersize fee for Matthijs de Ligt</a>, their 19-year-old captain. According to a report in the Sunday Times at the weekend, Juventus \u2013 a club with which Raiola has often done business \u2013 are the favourites to pay around \u00a375m, with the size of Raiola\u2019s commission a factor in the negotiations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d339a202a939cc96cb0c68257855166f4f6a8a1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d339a202a939cc96cb0c68257855166f4f6a8a1c/0_130_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Zlatan Ibrahimovic, barely out of his teens when they met at Ajax, Raiola found the perfect new member of his family.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Zlatan Ibrahimovic, barely out of his teens when they met at Ajax, Raiola found the perfect new member of his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frederic J. Brown/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are plenty of big-time agents operating in football \u2013 sharing, for example, the \u00a3260m that members of the Premier League alone paid out to them last year \u2013 but the 51-year-old Carmine Raiola is among those who seem to incarnate most clearly the shift in the relationship between clubs and players. Having moved as a child from a small town near Naples to Haarlem in the Netherlands, where he helped with the family\u2019s pizza restaurant, he enfolds his players in an embrace that goes beyond business meetings. Two years ago, having just moved Pogba from Juventus to United for a world record fee of \u00a389m, he articulated this approach in an interview with Simon Kuper of the Financial Times. \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a client at all,\u201d he said of the Frenchman. \u201cIn fact I dare to say, family.\u201d</p> <p>Raiola\u2019s football family is at the centre of this summer\u2019s activity. While De Ligt appears to have his pick of almost all the top clubs, will Pogba join his compatriot Zinedine Zidane in a restoration project at the Bernab\u00e9u, or rejoin Juventus, where he won four consecutive Serie A titles and felt at home?</p> <p>If his methods have earned him the dislike of some powerful men, Raiola\u2019s network of contacts, built up over the decades, has given him considerable influence. More than a quarter of a century ago Roy\u2019s departure from Amsterdam cemented the ambitious young agent\u2019s relationship with Zdenek Zeman, Foggia\u2019s head coach. Two years later, when Zeman moved on to Lazio, Raiola brought him Pavel Nedved, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/12/worldcup2006.sport24\" title=\"\">much in demand after his performances with the Czech Republic at Euro 96</a>. In 2001 Raiola moved Nedved on to Juventus, where he won the Ballon d\u2019Or. In 2004 Raiola introduced another player to the club: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the beginning of an odyssey that would take the Sweden striker to Internazionale, Barcelona, Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and LA Galaxy as Raiola surfed the shifting currents of the football market.</p> <p>In Ibrahimovic, barely out of his teens when they met at Ajax, Raiola found the perfect new member of his family. \u201cI realised straight away that he was an arrogant bastard \u2013 in other words, just like me,\u201d the agent said in an interview for the player\u2019s most recent autobiography, the modestly titled I Am Football. But there was more to it. Raiola taught Ibrahimovic to curb his dissent on the pitch (\u201cTell me one single time when a referee has walked over and said he was wrong and you were right\u201d) and, at Juventus, to follow the example of Nedved, who trained with obsessive diligence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78945d40b4e2cfc028ed3b28a75f139a4e1a83f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78945d40b4e2cfc028ed3b28a75f139a4e1a83f4/0_33_2628_1577/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ajax may yet be grateful for Mino Raiola\u2019s part in negotiating a supersize fee for Matthijs de Ligt, their 19-year-old captain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ajax may yet be grateful for Mino Raiola\u2019s part in negotiating a supersize fee for Matthijs de Ligt, their 19-year-old captain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe things I learned from Pavel Nedved, I transferred to Zlatan,\u201d Raiola said, \u201cand what I learned from Zlatan I taught Paul Pogba. Paul saw in Zlatan what he sees in himself \u2013 a lad from the streets, big in stature but extremely technical \u2013 and he recognised the attitude: win, win, win.\u201d</p> <p>Not much of that commitment to winning was on view in a red No 6 shirt during the final stages of United\u2019s season. But players are individuals, and do not always react according to a template. Raiola\u2019s major failure was with another man who saw himself as a kid from the streets, big in stature but extremely technical; the trouble with Mario Balotelli was that actually playing football took second place to the things his talent brought him.</p> <p>For a Balotelli, a Pogba, a De Ligt or an Ibrahimovic, there is only one career, and they depend on a Mino Raiola to ensure that the rewards last a lifetime. For Raiola himself, this is just another summer of playing the market, of spotting weaknesses to which he can supply the antidote, and of counting the proceeds.</p>",

This summer, depending on how things work out, Manchester United\u2019s supporters are unlikely to send Paul Pogba on his way with warm wishes for a successful future in Madrid or Turin. The prospect of that \u00a3100m-plus deal became more likely last week when, during a promotional visit to Japan, the French midfielder volunteered his readiness to accept a \u201cnew challenge\u201d away from Old Trafford. Some might think that helping Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to rescue a great club from the doldrums represents enough of a challenge for anyone, but that would not be Raiola\u2019s way. A controversial figure, particularly in Manchester, where he is detested by both Alex Ferguson (who once called him a \u201ctwat\u201d during face-to-face negotiations) and Pep Guardiola, the agent is free to negotiate on Pogba\u2019s behalf only because the court of arbitration for sport upheld his appeal against a worldwide three-month ban from all football activities imposed by Fifa in May. The sanction was first imposed by the FIGC, the Italian football association, but the nature of the alleged irregularities was never officially disclosed. On the other hand, Ajax may yet be grateful for the agent\u2019s part in negotiating a supersize fee for Matthijs de Ligt, their 19-year-old captain. According to a report in the Sunday Times at the weekend, Juventus \u2013 a club with which Raiola has often done business \u2013 are the favourites to pay around \u00a375m, with the size of Raiola\u2019s commission a factor in the negotiations. There are plenty of big-time agents operating in football \u2013 sharing, for example, the \u00a3260m that members of the Premier League alone paid out to them last year \u2013 but the 51-year-old Carmine Raiola is among those who seem to incarnate most clearly the shift in the relationship between clubs and players. Having moved as a child from a small town near Naples to Haarlem in the Netherlands, where he helped with the family\u2019s pizza restaurant, he enfolds his players in an embrace that goes beyond business meetings. Two years ago, having just moved Pogba from Juventus to United for a world record fee of \u00a389m, he articulated this approach in an interview with Simon Kuper of the Financial Times. \u201cI don\u2019t see him as a client at all,\u201d he said of the Frenchman. \u201cIn fact I dare to say, family.\u201d Raiola\u2019s football family is at the centre of this summer\u2019s activity. While De Ligt appears to have his pick of almost all the top clubs, will Pogba join his compatriot Zinedine Zidane in a restoration project at the Bernab\u00e9u, or rejoin Juventus, where he won four consecutive Serie A titles and felt at home? If his methods have earned him the dislike of some powerful men, Raiola\u2019s network of contacts, built up over the decades, has given him considerable influence. More than a quarter of a century ago Roy\u2019s departure from Amsterdam cemented the ambitious young agent\u2019s relationship with Zdenek Zeman, Foggia\u2019s head coach. Two years later, when Zeman moved on to Lazio, Raiola brought him Pavel Nedved, much in demand after his performances with the Czech Republic at Euro 96. In 2001 Raiola moved Nedved on to Juventus, where he won the Ballon d\u2019Or. In 2004 Raiola introduced another player to the club: Zlatan Ibrahimovic, the beginning of an odyssey that would take the Sweden striker to Internazionale, Barcelona, Milan, Paris Saint-Germain, Manchester United and LA Galaxy as Raiola surfed the shifting currents of the football market. In Ibrahimovic, barely out of his teens when they met at Ajax, Raiola found the perfect new member of his family. \u201cI realised straight away that he was an arrogant bastard \u2013 in other words, just like me,\u201d the agent said in an interview for the player\u2019s most recent autobiography, the modestly titled I Am Football. But there was more to it. Raiola taught Ibrahimovic to curb his dissent on the pitch (\u201cTell me one single time when a referee has walked over and said he was wrong and you were right\u201d) and, at Juventus, to follow the example of Nedved, who trained with obsessive diligence. \u201cThe things I learned from Pavel Nedved, I transferred to Zlatan,\u201d Raiola said, \u201cand what I learned from Zlatan I taught Paul Pogba. Paul saw in Zlatan what he sees in himself \u2013 a lad from the streets, big in stature but extremely technical \u2013 and he recognised the attitude: win, win, win.\u201d Not much of that commitment to winning was on view in a red No 6 shirt during the final stages of United\u2019s season. But players are individuals, and do not always react according to a template. Raiola\u2019s major failure was with another man who saw himself as a kid from the streets, big in stature but extremely technical; the trouble with Mario Balotelli was that actually playing football took second place to the things his talent brought him. For a Balotelli, a Pogba, a De Ligt or an Ibrahimovic, there is only one career, and they depend on a Mino Raiola to ensure that the rewards last a lifetime. For Raiola himself, this is just another summer of playing the market, of spotting weaknesses to which he can supply the antidote, and of counting the proceeds.",

On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship\u2019s Polish mate:</p> <p>\u201cA capital chap, though queer to look at; he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts\u2026\u201d</p> <p>John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction.</p> </blockquote> <p>Amazing!</p> <h2><strong>Interesting links about books and reading</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p>From Tel Aviv with love: <a href=\"https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/write-me-tell-me-your-heart-leonard-cohens-letters-marianne/tel-aviv-love-1/71335\">Leonard Cohen\u2019s letters to Marianne have just been sold at auction</a>.</p></li> <li><p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/the-strange-story-of-a-secret-literary-fellowship\">strange story</a>\u201d of a secretive award funded by the chairman of Barnes &amp; Noble.</p></li> <li><p>James Campbell on <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/john-fowles-french-lieutenants-woman-fifty/\">John Fowles\u2019 French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman at 50</a>.</p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/books/review/tamara-shopsin-david-berman.html?ref=headline&amp;nl_art=&amp;te=1&amp;nl=book-review&amp;emc=edit_bk_20190621?campaign_id=69&amp;instance_id=10399&amp;segment_id=14548&amp;user_id=de58d5d545b07b9e09939e21818c932a&amp;regi_id=41740674edit_bk_20190621\">A literal (cartoon) rendering of David Berman\u2019s poetry</a>.</p></li> <li><p>Paul Ewen <a href=\"https://www.englishpen.org/campaigns/swap-for-behrouz-boochani/\">in solidarity with the illegally detained writer Behrouz Boochani</a><em>.</em></p></li> </ul> <p>If you\u2019re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/guardianbooks/\">#GuardianBooks</a>, and we\u2019ll include a selection in this blog.

I have read the first two and will endeavour to read the rest of the series. Funnily enough I have never managed to sit through a whole episode of the TV show. Finally, a fascinating literary nugget from Zdzis\u0142aw Najder\u2019s, Joseph Conrad: A Life, courtesy of interwar: Pursuing Joseph Conrad\u2019s beginnings as a writer, I came across this: In March 1893 the Torrens, \u201cone of the most famous sailing ships of its day\u201d, set sail from Adelaide, Australia on its return voyage to London. On board was a wealthy young English barrister who had been travelling round the Pacific. From shipboard he wrote to his mother about meeting a remarkable man, the ship\u2019s Polish mate: \u201cA capital chap, though queer to look at; he is a man of travel and experience in many parts of the world, and has a fund of yarns .... He has been right up the Congo and all around Malacca and Borneo and other out of the way parts\u2026\u201d John Galsworthy had not yet turned to writing and his new friend, Konrad Korzeniowski, though secretly working on a novel, had not yet become Joseph Conrad. Both would remain friends, however, as they gained fame for their fiction. Amazing! Interesting links about books and reading From Tel Aviv with love: Leonard Cohen\u2019s letters to Marianne have just been sold at auction. The \u201cstrange story\u201d of a secretive award funded by the chairman of Barnes &amp; Noble. James Campbell on John Fowles\u2019 French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman at 50. A literal (cartoon) rendering of David Berman\u2019s poetry. Paul Ewen in solidarity with the illegally detained writer Behrouz Boochani.

      "body": "<p>Dave Bartholomew has died in New Orleans aged 100. While his passing is unlikely to attract the kind of accolades given to many deceased musicians, Bartholomew was a giant, a man who helped shape the sound and direction of both rhythm and blues and rock\u2019n\u2019roll while indirectly helping shape ska and, much later, rap. Bartholomew liked to state, \u201cI invented the big beat\u201d, and this was no idle boast: if any one musician can be given credit for shaping the sound of the US after the second world war, it was Bartholomew.</p> <p>Bartholomew was born in Edgard, Louisiana, in 1918: a small town whose African American populace worked in sugar mills or on the docks servicing the river boats. Bartholomew\u2019s father played tuba with jazz bands, shifting the family to New Orleans in 1933, where he worked on river boats and in bars. Here, the musically precocious youth began playing trumpet in local jazz and brass bands. He served in the US military during the war, returning to New Orleans in November 1945. Forming his own band, Dave Bartholomew and the Dew Droppers \u2013 named after the locally famous black music hotel and nightclub, The Dew Drop Inn \u2013 Bartholomew forged rhythm and blues out of jump blues and swing. A local reporter wrote of Bartholomew\u2019s band in 1947: \u201cPutting it mildly, they made the house \u2018rock.\u2019\u201d Within a decade the western world would be rocking to Bartholomew\u2019s sound.</p> <p>In 1947, Bartholomew made his debut record for DeLuxe Records. It sold well locally and he scored his first national hit in 1949 with the suggestive Country Boy. That same year, while playing in Houston, Texas, Bartholomew was approached on the bandstand by Lew Chudd of Imperial Records, a fledgling, Los Angeles-based independent record label then concentrating on selling Mexican records; Chudd asked Bartholomew if he would be interested in working with him.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CUiBapE0_vM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CUiBapE0_vM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Soon Bartholomew would serve as Imperial\u2019s New Orleans A&amp;R man \u2013 scouting and signing talent, then producing, arranging, often songwriting for and playing on the sessions. In 1949, Imperial\u2019s first two R&amp;B chart hits both featured Bartholomew\u2019s many talents: Jewel King\u2019s 3 x 7 = 21 and Fats Domino\u2019s The Fat Man. Bartholomew had found Domino playing in local bars and recognised the portly youth\u2019s star quality: together the two men adapted Junker\u2019s Blues, a song about heroin addiction, into The Fat Man. Lew Chudd initially hated it but it was an immediate hit with black listeners, selling over a million copies. The Fat Man is now often called \u201cthe first rock\u2019n\u2019roll record\u201d.</p> <p>Bartholomew left Imperial in 1950 after a dispute over money and concentrated on making his own records, cutting the street party anthem Shrimp and Gumbo, proto-rap The Monkey and the innuendo-laden My Ding A Ling (the tune Chuck Berry would make his only ever UK No 1 in 1972) while also producing Lloyd Price\u2019s 1952 debut single Lawdy Miss Clawdy (a R&amp;B No 1 that would soon be recorded by everyone from Elvis Presley and the Beatles to the Replacements and Lemmy). Imperial lured Bartholomew back in 1952 and, in 1955, he and Domino would set off on an extended run of hits \u2013 Dave producing and co-writing the songs and leading a band that featured several musicians now hailed as pioneers (drummer Earl Palmer, saxophonist Lee Allen, and guitarist Walter \u201cPapoose\u201d Nelson).

But when she met Owen she had neither had a boyfriend, nor told anyone she was a virgin. She ascribes her lack of sexual experience to self-consciousness about her appearance and her traditional Indian upbringing. Preeta\u2019s parents had had an arranged marriage, and their disapproval of premarital sex was hard to shake, even though she did not agree with them.</p> <p>The combination of factors led to her being what she describes as \u201ca bit particular\u201d; she was without confidence, but not self-respect, and wanted her first time to be with someone special. \u201cMy biggest fear was marrying someone to please my parents, then later on meeting somebody I really loved.\u201d</p> <p>Owen\u2019s experience was different. He was bullied at school, struggled to make friends and considered himself \u201ckind of an outsider\u201d. In his 20s he focused on his career in IT and moved for work. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I was 28 or 29 that it really occurred to me that I should have had a girlfriend by now.\u201d When he signed up to the dating agency, he had already thought about going to see a sex worker. \u201cI never really got anywhere, for want of a better term, before I met Preeta,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Preeta was his first kiss, on their fifth date. They discovered they were both virgins the same night. A little while later, \u201cwe tried and it didn\u2019t happen, then one time it did, and that was that,\u201d says Preeta. \u201cIt was nice, actually, discovering that he had no experience either, because it just meant we could learn together. It came together very naturally.\u201d</p> <p>Now that they are married, the fact that they have not had previous partners is \u201cneither here nor there\u201d, she says. The affection, intimacy and support of their marriage is still more important to her than sex. Luck, they say, was a factor in their meeting, but it also took work to join the dating agency, to make time to see each other, to get to know each other, to overcome the fear of intimacy and even of falling in love.</p> <p>In fact, Preeta admits ruefully, she had been thinking of not seeing Owen again after their second date. \u201cIt was so stupid, looking back \u2013 it was a ridiculous reason \u2013 but Owen was sober at the time and on our second date he ordered a milkshake. I was like: \u2018Who does that?\u2019 I just thought it was really weird.\u201d</p> <p>Owen believes dating is generally harder for men, because of the lingering expectation that they will make the first move. But he approached dating as a hobby, thinking: \u201cI\u2019d just give it a try.\u201d With age, physical attractiveness is less important than being a well-rounded person, he says. \u201cIt is hard. But you\u2019ve got to make things happen a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>He has been in therapy on and off since he was 17, \u201cand I\u2019ve learned that a lot of our beliefs are patterns or habits, and you have to break out.

He was 36 at the time. \u201cIt was like, is that it? There was nothing amazing about it.\u201d But then he had never really been interested in sex, even as a teenager. Now 44, Alex has not had sex in more than four years, and, although he would like a relationship, he accepts that it may not happen.</p> <p>The light of his life is his three-year-old daughter. Though he and her mother are no longer a couple, they have a good relationship. Alex takes care of their little girl every weekend. \u201cEvery Friday, I knock on the door, and before I\u2019ve even finished knocking, she goes: \u2018DADDY.\u2019 When I was younger, I said I\u2019d never get married, I\u2019d never have kids. But my daughter\u2019s the best thing to have happened in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Rhea, 33, lost her virginity six months ago, on her second date with a man she met through an app. Although it was no great love story \u2013 he ghosted her afterwards \u2013 she describes it as enjoyable: \u201cIt was clumsy, nothing like the movies, but fun nonetheless.\u201d Losing her virginity changed little, she says, beyond relieving her of the pressure to pretend. \u201cI do feel like I can get on with life and that one thing is off my list \u2013 and I did it on my terms.\u201d</p> <p>For others, the act itself can be the least of their challenges.

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019ll have my support if he does the right thing.

In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on \u201cGatt 24 or whatever it happens to be\u201d to provide for a \u201cstandstill in our current arrangements\u201d.</p> <p>Under article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under a no-deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation.</p> <p>The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, is that this \u201cisn\u2019t true\u201d. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It gives the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one.</p> <p>But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/15/varadkar-removing-backstop-would-be-as-bad-as-no-deal-brexit\">Leo Varadkar, has said</a> that without a legally binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission.</p> <p>Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way.</p> <p>The problems with it are legion.

      "bodyText": "The question, set less by Brussels than the logic of Brexit, is how the UK government can in one move leave the European union\u2019s single market and customs while also maintaining the flow of trade and people on its one land border with the bloc in Ireland The fact that the existence of the land border in question cost more than 3,600 lives over 30 years led to the British government in December 2017 restating its commitment to avoid \u201ca hard border, including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls\u201d. Avoiding a backdoor for smugglers into the single market is additionally regarded as essential by Dublin and the European commission, as is avoiding crippling extra bureaucracy on Irish businesses. The so-called Irish backstop in the 585-page withdrawal agreement \u2013 to remain in place \u201cunless and until\u201d an alternative solution for keeping the border open is found \u2013 offers one solution by doing two key things. First, Northern Ireland stays within the EU\u2019s regulatory regime, and under direct jurisdiction of the European court of justice, so as to allow a single market for goods on the island of Ireland. Second, the whole of the UK shares a customs territory with the EU to avoid any checks on goods both between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom. But rejected three times by the Commons on the grounds that the UK could be tied into the backstop indefinitely, leaving the government unable to sign its own comprehensive trade deals, the withdrawal agreement is said by Boris Johnson, still the frontrunner in the Tory leadership battle, to be \u201cdefunct\u201d. What is the alternative? In recent days, Johnson has suggested that the EU and UK could give themselves more time to work on the problem by relying on \u201cGatt 24 or whatever it happens to be\u201d to provide for a \u201cstandstill in our current arrangements\u201d. Under article XXIV of the general agreement on tariffs and trade, tariffs would remain at zero even under a no-deal exit on 31 October for up to a decade, it is said. The agreement could additionally leave the Irish border open while the two sides sought a new accommodation. The problem for Johnson, in the words of the trade secretary, Liam Fox, is that this \u201cisn\u2019t true\u201d. Article XXIV is only relevant if there is an an agreement in principle on a free trade deal. It gives the two parties time to turn an interim deal into a final one. But the EU has said that the first and necessary step towards a trade deal is ratification of the withdrawal agreement. And the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, has said that without a legally binding guarantee that a hard border will not reemerge there will be no withdrawal agreement. In the light of this, interest has been aroused in a 201-page report published on Monday by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission. Backed by two former ministers, Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, it has suggested that by 2022 a solution could be in place using a mix of technology, trusted trade schemes, mobile checks on food and animals within a new joint Irish-British Sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) zone, special economic zones to push customs checks away from the border and a certain amount of looking the other way. The problems with it are legion. By imposing checks within a newly delineated border zone it fails the central task of avoiding new checks, and creates targets for terrorists in the new mobile veterinary vans. The burden of Brexit is put on Irish businesses. The exemptions on checks for many crossing the border will set off alarm bells for those concerned about the integrity of the single market. But the central problem for Brussels is that the plan is theoretical. There remains no certainty at all that the complicated IT systems, democratic consultation on the creation of new economic zones or negotiations with the European commission on the finer detail would be finalised by the end of the transition period of \u201cstandstill\u201d relations. The Irish backstop would then have to remain to guarantee the avoidance of a hard border. The Brexit logic remains unyielding.",

      "body": "<p>Andy first clapped eyes on Yves in 1996, when they were living in the same block of flats in Newcastle. \u201cSomeone used to play this loud, terrible music and my boyfriend presumed it was him,\u201d says Andy. \u201cI used to bang on the ceiling shouting: \u2018Shut up, you French wanker!\u2019\u201d Yves laughs. \u201cYes, she just assumed it was me.

Wow! That was the best kiss ever.\u201d</p> <p>Still, at this point, neither was looking for a serious relationship. \u201cHe was all heartbroken over another girl, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll never love again.\u2019\u201d But they continued to see each other after Yves moved to London a few months later. \u201cI used to drive from work late at night to come and see her,\u201d he remembers. \u201cOne time, I ended up sleeping in the car. I rang the doorbell at 2am, but she didn\u2019t wake up because she was drunk.\u201d</p> <p>Andy laughs. \u201cYeah, I probably was. I think it impressed me that you\u2019d slept in the car.\u201d</p> <p>By the end of 1997, they were officially a couple and Yves moved in with Andy. It is fair to say it didn\u2019t go smoothly at first. \u201cHe lost my cat. I told him not to leave the window open.\u201d Although she was \u201cfurious\u201d, she eventually forgave him. The pair decided to get married in 1999. \u201cHe\u2019s so handsome and such a charmer,\u201d Andy says. \u201cWe bicker, but it\u2019s from a place of humour and we have the same sensibilities at our core.\u201d Yves says their relationship has become stronger over time. \u201cAt the start, it was all drink, laughter and lust. I think we bid on laughter and took a chance.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think they bicker that much.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about the honeymoon fights?\u201d says Andy. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Yves laughs, remembering one incident when they had been fighting in the car. \u201cI thought it would be funny to move the car while she was in the petrol station shop.\u201d Andy, who didn\u2019t realise, got in to someone else\u2019s car and started shouting at the man in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThat poor Spanish bloke didn\u2019t know what hit him!\u201d</p> <p>In 2003, the couple moved to Portugal; they have since faced many difficult times together, including bereavement and Yves\u2019 battle with an aggressive cancer. He is better after treatment but it was a scary time.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who saw us on that honeymoon would think we\u2019d still be together 20 years later,\u201d says Andy. \u201cHe makes me whole, though, as cliched as it sounds. He\u2019s funny, annoying \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not annoying,\u201d interrupts Yves.</p> <p>\u201cYou definitely are. But you make me a better person.

That was the best kiss ever.\u201d Still, at this point, neither was looking for a serious relationship. \u201cHe was all heartbroken over another girl, saying: \u2018I\u2019ll never love again.\u2019\u201d But they continued to see each other after Yves moved to London a few months later. \u201cI used to drive from work late at night to come and see her,\u201d he remembers. \u201cOne time, I ended up sleeping in the car. I rang the doorbell at 2am, but she didn\u2019t wake up because she was drunk.\u201d Andy laughs. \u201cYeah, I probably was. I think it impressed me that you\u2019d slept in the car.\u201d By the end of 1997, they were officially a couple and Yves moved in with Andy. It is fair to say it didn\u2019t go smoothly at first. \u201cHe lost my cat. I told him not to leave the window open.\u201d Although she was \u201cfurious\u201d, she eventually forgave him. The pair decided to get married in 1999. \u201cHe\u2019s so handsome and such a charmer,\u201d Andy says. \u201cWe bicker, but it\u2019s from a place of humour and we have the same sensibilities at our core.\u201d Yves says their relationship has become stronger over time. \u201cAt the start, it was all drink, laughter and lust. I think we bid on laughter and took a chance.\u201d He doesn\u2019t think they bicker that much. \u201cWhat about the honeymoon fights?\u201d says Andy. \u201cOh yeah.\u201d Yves laughs, remembering one incident when they had been fighting in the car. \u201cI thought it would be funny to move the car while she was in the petrol station shop.\u201d Andy, who didn\u2019t realise, got in to someone else\u2019s car and started shouting at the man in the driver\u2019s seat. \u201cThat poor Spanish bloke didn\u2019t know what hit him!\u201d In 2003, the couple moved to Portugal; they have since faced many difficult times together, including bereavement and Yves\u2019 battle with an aggressive cancer. He is better after treatment but it was a scary time. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone who saw us on that honeymoon would think we\u2019d still be together 20 years later,\u201d says Andy. \u201cHe makes me whole, though, as cliched as it sounds. He\u2019s funny, annoying \u2013\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not annoying,\u201d interrupts Yves. \u201cYou definitely are. But you make me a better person. I know I can be \u2013\u201d \u201cArsey? Short-tempered?\u201d They laugh again. \u201cAndy makes me a better person, too,\u201d says Yves. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be without her.\u201d Want to share your story? Tell us a little about you, your partner and how you got together by filling in the form here.",

We did not do so because we oppose the festival itself. I have previously performed poetry there and believe the BLF has done invaluable work for the local community through years of grassroots engagement centred on BME people. However, I chose not to participate this year when I found out the festival was a beneficiary of a fund called <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/building-a-stronger-britain-together\">Building a Stronger Britain Together (BSBT)</a>. This fund comes from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-extremism-strategy\">Counter-Extremism Strategy</a> (CES) and it is this strategy, this fund, and this connection that I and others oppose.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bradford\u2019s predominantly Pakistani, Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The government\u2019s website describes BSBT as \u201cfunding and support for groups involved in counter-extremism projects in their communities\u201d, and it was used <a href=\"https://www.bradfordlitfest.co.uk/statement-withdrawal-speakers-years-festival/\">to fund some of BLF\u2019s pre-festival programmes</a> engaging local Muslim women on their aspirations and literacy. While I am sure the programmes were beneficial to participants, it is highly problematic to suggest that the people the projects engage are at risk of becoming extremists due solely to their identity. It is rooted in the <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0306396812454984\">counter-radicalisation thesis</a> that suggests that since <em>any</em> Muslim could become violent, all Muslims require monitoring. It reduces Muslims to subjects requiring de-radicalisation.</p> <p>Bradford\u2019s predominantly Pakistani, Muslim population has long been looked at through a lens of criminality. Not only does BSBT look at the community through that same lens but it also entails a level of information collection, because it requires reporting on outcomes.

Counter-extremism works largely to hide the material conditions that disenfranchise people, which may lead them to express grievances violently \u2013 including austerity, poverty, structural racism, Islamophobia and more. A government could seek to change these rather than funnelling money into an apparatus that approaches Muslims as a suspect community living in a vacuum.</p> <p>This is particularly pernicious in the austerity context, where government has pulled money from arts and culture and cut local council budgets so that spaces such as libraries and community centres are on the decline. It means counter-extremism becomes one of very few pots of funding that groups such as BLF feel they can draw on to create those missing spaces. This makes organisations dependent on counter-extremism funding. We refuse to give credibility to the idea there is demand for such funds. Some have argued that we should express this opinion <em>at </em>the festival, but this counter-extremism strategy would only gain more credibility if it could be said dissenting voices were given space to speak under its banner.

      "bodyText": "Greater Manchester could become the first city region in the UK to take back control of its buses after a report recommended refranchising its vast and fragmented network. The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said he hoped to use the powers to build a London-style integrated transport system that puts passengers\u2019 needs before the interests of private bus companies. His vision, called Our Network \u2013 a nod to the Mancunian habit of calling a sibling \u201cour kid\u201d \u2013 will include the largest public bike hire scheme per head in the UK, including electric bikes, and will start rolling out next spring. Our Pass will launch on 1 July, offering free bus travel for the region\u2019s 16- to 18-year-olds. Burnham has been preparing for a battle with some of the 42 bus companies that compete for business in Greater Manchester, which has a population of 2.8 million people. Private operators including Stagecoach and First are currently able to cherrypick the most profitable routes and set their own timetables, leaving large swathes of the region, and often the poorest, without regular services. It frequently costs \u00a34 to go 5 miles \u2013 a journey that would be \u00a31.50 in London \u2013 and services do not connect with other modes of transport. Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) spends \u00a327.1m a year subsidising about 20% of the region\u2019s bus services, which run at times of day and in areas where there is a social need. Passenger numbers have plunged since the service was privatised in 1986, with the number of annual journeys falling by 45% from 355m then to 195m in last year. \u201cMany of those people have migrated to the car, as we see from the congestion,\u201d said Burnham. In London, bus use almost doubled in the same period, rising from 1.2bn in 1986 to 2.2bn in 2018, he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t carry on this way,\u201d Burnham said. \u201cThat\u2019s why Greater Manchester is the first city region seeking to make use of the new powers under the Bus Services Act 2017 and the first to test this legislation \u2013 so is leading the way nationally in this regard.\u201d The ability to take back buses into public control was given to mayoral authorities by the government in 2017. Though an assessment by TfGM has recommended refranchising as Burnham\u2019s best option, its report must be independently audited before going out to a statutory public consultation, during which the bus companies are expected to fight their corner hard, warning of higher fares and council tax bills. Talking at the Home arts centre in Manchester on Monday, Burnham called for an end to the region\u2019s \u201cconfusing and fragmented\u201d system. \u201cAt the moment our transport system isn\u2019t sufficiently accountable to the public. We own part of it but not all of it \u2026 we need to bring this system into one framework of accountability so that people can hold me to account about what is happening in their city region.\u201d Greater Manchester controls its tram service, Metrolink, which will expand to Trafford Park and the Trafford Centre next year, with 27 new trams entering operation. \u201cWe need to stop building for the car,\u201d said Burnham, who has appointed the former racing cyclist Chris Boardman as the region\u2019s cycling and walking commissioner. Boardman said he was looking for an operator to run a Greater Manchester-wide bike hire programme, with the aim of it being \u201cthe largest public bike hire scheme per resident of its kind in the UK\u201d within 10 years. Last year, a private bike hire operator, Mobike, pulled out of the city due to theft and vandalism of its fleet. Boardman said he hoped his scheme would avoid that fate by making users return bikes to docks, like the Santander bikes in London. The rollout would begin next year in Manchester and Salford centres. \u201cWe want to get it established in the centres first,\u201d Boardman said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want another Mobike, discovering problems as we go.\u201d He said electric bikes would almost inevitably be included \u201cin the lumpier areas\u201d. Boardman has begun to build the Bee Network, 1,800 miles of safe cycling and walking routes, but has so far received just \u00a3160m of the \u00a31.5bn cost. \u201cThe money has got to be found and it has got to be committed,\u201d he said. \u201c\u00a31.5bn sounds a lot because it is spaced over 10 years, but in transport terms, it\u2019s not a lot at all. There is a junction in Bedfordshire, the Black Cat Junction, which is going to be remodelled at a cost of \u00a31.4bn \u2013 just one junction.\u201d Stagecoach accused Burnham of providing no evidence to support his claim that franchising was better than a partnership approach and failing to mention \u201cthe massive bill they would have to pay for a London-style bus system\u201d.

Does it matter what he does in his personal life? Is it of any relevance? We assume now that it does matter in a very primary way, but I wanted to interrogate that.\u201d</p> <p>For those who\u2019ve been following the dazzling career of the 32-year-old Icke, his collaboration with the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam seems like the fulfilment of a promise. Previously known as Toneelgroep Amsterdam, this is the artistic home of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/ivo-van-hove\">Ivo van Hove</a>, the director to whom Icke has most commonly been compared. In his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/25/hamlet-andrew-scott-harold-pinter-theatre-west-end-transfer-review-robert-icke\">Hamlet with Andrew Scott</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/dec/18/mary-stuart-almeida-robert-icke-observer-review-lia-williams-juliet-stevenson\">Mary Stuart with Lia Williams and Juliet Stevenson</a>, and an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/07/oresteia-review-icke-brings-us-aeschylus-for-the-modern-age\">Oresteia set in a modern-day kitchen</a>, Icke has demonstrated a similar drive for textual clarity and an equal disdain for tradition.</p> <p>\u201cThe way they perform is so free,\u201d Icke says of the ensemble. \u201cIt\u2019s without hierarchy and without that strange poshness that seems to creep into British theatre and makes it feel museum-like and deadening. They are incredible actors. If Hans Kesting and Marieke Heebink acted in English, they would be massive stars.\u201d</p> <p>Kesting returns the compliment: \u201cIt was for him very scary because it was his first production outside Britain, with foreign actors who are used to Ivo and other big directors. But from day one, he clicked with everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Painstakingly translating from the original Greek, Icke wrote his version with the actors in mind. \u201cThe challenge was to provide for an audience today the impact and immediacy of the original before we all knew its twists and turns,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7de65ac17f8ee116eb041ff080d383e2f6c08807\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7de65ac17f8ee116eb041ff080d383e2f6c08807/247_518_3916_2349/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Product of an abusive relationship\u2019: Marieke Heebink as Jocasta and Hans Kesting as Oedipus in Robert Icke\u2019s new version.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Product of an abusive relationship\u2019: Marieke Heebink as Jocasta and Hans Kesting as Oedipus in Robert Icke\u2019s new version.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jan Versweyveld</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That means a production that bristles with modern-day talking points, from politicians who go off-message to the implication that Oedipus was the product of an abusive relationship (just do the maths on the ages). Throw in the campaign T-shirts, pizza boxes and political spin, and this Oedipus feels like a play for today. There will, of course, be those who question the need for a rewrite when the Sophocles version has proved durable for more than two millennia, but it\u2019s not an argument he buys.</p> <p>\u201cTelling any story is a process of self-discovery,\u201d Icke says. \u201cThe pretence that there\u2019s a neutral version of a play, that you could do what Sophocles intended, is so obviously ridiculous. It\u2019s exactly the same impulse that has brought us to Brexit. There\u2019s a poisonous nostalgia that says you\u2019re committing an act of vandalism if you don\u2019t do the Sophocles as Sophocles would have wanted it. To do that, I\u2019d have to do it in ancient Greek. You\u2019re not asking for the original, you\u2019re asking for a safe, culturally mandated version that has no deep relationship to the original, just to a performance tradition.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/sep/02/michael-billington-101-greatest-plays\">From Oedipus to The History Boys: Michael Billington's 101 greatest plays</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He continues: \u201cThere\u2019s a horrendous possibility for exclusion in the way we talk about theatre.

We assume now that it does matter in a very primary way, but I wanted to interrogate that.\u201d For those who\u2019ve been following the dazzling career of the 32-year-old Icke, his collaboration with the Internationaal Theater Amsterdam seems like the fulfilment of a promise. Previously known as Toneelgroep Amsterdam, this is the artistic home of Ivo van Hove, the director to whom Icke has most commonly been compared. In his Hamlet with Andrew Scott, Mary Stuart with Lia Williams and Juliet Stevenson, and an Oresteia set in a modern-day kitchen, Icke has demonstrated a similar drive for textual clarity and an equal disdain for tradition. \u201cThe way they perform is so free,\u201d Icke says of the ensemble. \u201cIt\u2019s without hierarchy and without that strange poshness that seems to creep into British theatre and makes it feel museum-like and deadening. They are incredible actors. If Hans Kesting and Marieke Heebink acted in English, they would be massive stars.\u201d Kesting returns the compliment: \u201cIt was for him very scary because it was his first production outside Britain, with foreign actors who are used to Ivo and other big directors. But from day one, he clicked with everyone.\u201d Painstakingly translating from the original Greek, Icke wrote his version with the actors in mind. \u201cThe challenge was to provide for an audience today the impact and immediacy of the original before we all knew its twists and turns,\u201d he says. That means a production that bristles with modern-day talking points, from politicians who go off-message to the implication that Oedipus was the product of an abusive relationship (just do the maths on the ages). Throw in the campaign T-shirts, pizza boxes and political spin, and this Oedipus feels like a play for today. There will, of course, be those who question the need for a rewrite when the Sophocles version has proved durable for more than two millennia, but it\u2019s not an argument he buys. \u201cTelling any story is a process of self-discovery,\u201d Icke says. \u201cThe pretence that there\u2019s a neutral version of a play, that you could do what Sophocles intended, is so obviously ridiculous. It\u2019s exactly the same impulse that has brought us to Brexit. There\u2019s a poisonous nostalgia that says you\u2019re committing an act of vandalism if you don\u2019t do the Sophocles as Sophocles would have wanted it. To do that, I\u2019d have to do it in ancient Greek. You\u2019re not asking for the original, you\u2019re asking for a safe, culturally mandated version that has no deep relationship to the original, just to a performance tradition.\u201d He continues: \u201cThere\u2019s a horrendous possibility for exclusion in the way we talk about theatre. Theatre in Britain is so often pompous, thinking of itself as church, and I don\u2019t think that delivers a real experience to an audience. You can have a balance between a deep respect for an old text and, at the same time, an acknowledgement we\u2019re alive now and we\u2019re all in the room now.\u201d \u2022 Oedipus is at the King\u2019s Theatre, Edinburgh, 14\u201317 August, as part of the Edinburgh international festival.",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

      "bodyText": "A woman who was refused a visa to return to London after travelling to Pakistan to adopt a baby has been told she can come home. Nina Saleh has a Norwegian passport but full UK residency rights after living in London for 20 years. She was refused a visa to return home with baby Sofia three times, despite going through a stringent and lengthy adoption process in the UK with British authorities\u2019 involvement. Within 48 hours of the Guardian and others publishing her story, Saleh received news that the Home Office was overturning its decision and allowing her back home. Speaking from Karachi, where she has spent four months waiting for her case to be resolved, Saleh told the Guardian she had almost lost hope of ever getting home. \u201cJust this morning I was crying my eyes out. My friend who was also adopting here got her visa yesterday and was dreading telling me. We met through the adoption process, we were all in the same WhatsApp group. Obviously I was happy for her but I felt so upset for me and for Sofia. I was crying so much. I thought this would never end. \u201cThen my lawyer called and said it got overturned, and now I am so happy. \u201cThe media pressure was instrumental in getting this overturned. I think it\u2019s alarming how unprofessional the Home Office is.

His first collection, <a href=\"https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781784107390\">Nineveh</a>, takes delight in bringing disciplines and dictions together to interrogate history and each other. Incantation and instruction, meditation techniques and the social media, meet in this week\u2019s poem, which takes the shape of a parodic listicle. An informal Yiddish idiom adds homeliness and an ironical shrug. Let\u2019s begin with the title, which puts the \u201coy\u201d in \u201cpoyem\u201d.</p> <p>David Robson contends that <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/comment/columnists/oy-the-word-that-says-it-all-1.53147\">\u201coy\u201d is a \u201cGoy proof\u201d word</a> (questionable, I think.

He explains that \u201ca thousand Chasidic oys equal one extended Buddhist \u201cOmm\u2026\u201d \u2013 a nice listicle-style aphorism in the spirt of Akins\u2019s poem, adding that \u201cA single \u2018oy\u2019 does justice to almost any crisis and every ecstasy.\u201d A thought to hold on to as we read.</p> <p>\u201cPoyem\u201d carries perhaps an echo of \u201cpayim\u201d from <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Samuel+13%3A21-23&amp;version=WEB\">1 Samuel 13: 21-23</a> where it represents two thirds of a silver shekel, the cost of sword-sharpening. Poetry, and keen speech itself, have a price? At the same time, Atkins is alive to the sheer j-<em>oy</em> of his art, including its significance for meditation. There\u2019s an underlying awareness of what poetry can achieve through its own self-examination, and a potential for ecstasy as well as crisis in many of his poems. This one is ultimately a demonstration of the triumph of argument.</p> <p>Instructions are essential to both digital communications and spiritual exercises, but the result of the proposed 28, we\u2019re told at once, is \u201cnon-mastery\u201d. That\u2019s reassuring. The satirical emphasis throughout the poem falls on the commands and the promised reward, but the couplets suggest some profound logical investigation, as well as being funny. Even the first and simplest stimulates the brain-cells with its double-take double negative: \u201cClick here for 29 reasons / you are not <em>not</em> Mark Ruffalo.\u201d Ethical and mystical notes enhance the flavour of stanza three. \u201cClick<em> next</em> to receive yourself as a coupon. / Click Play Now to become forever.\u201d The results of the two clicks seem antithetical at a first glance, but both may represent forms of hubris, one material, one spiritual.</p> <p>I mentioned the aphorism earlier: conjuring aphorisms is one of the skills Atkins has brilliantly not <em>not</em> mastered. Poetry likes them, readers love them, at least when they\u2019re not glib or otherwise unearned. There\u2019s an underlying moral seriousness to their playful deployment by Atkins, when they are playful. Sometimes, of course, they\u2019re simply serious: \u201cEach second you give to thinking // will be matched by 30 minutes / of callousness, regret, and avoidance.\u201d</p> <p>The poem is a fine, bright-witted balancing act. Political anger is evident in the vision of a plague of digitised consumerist ephemera that eventually annihilates conscience.

The former Oasis singer, 46, said: \u201cEvery time you wake up in the morning, there\u2019s some 16-year-old kid been knifed to death. I\u2019ve got kids that age, out and about and that, doing their thing, living, being young. That freaks me right out \u2013 it does worry me.

      "body": "<p>The stories came thick and fast at Royal Ascot and the good news audience-wise was that ITV\u2019s viewing figures were impressive throughout the meeting.</p> <p>Thursday\u2019s numbers were particularly strong, presumably as word spread that Frankie Dettori was seizing control of the proceedings as only he can. The Thursday peak of 1.4m viewers was the highest for any afternoon at Royal Ascot for seven years (since the days when it was on the BBC, in other words). The peak figure also passed 1m on all five days of the meeting for the first time in ITV\u2019s three years with the rights.</p> <p>The bad news audience-wise \u2013 well, slightly disappointing news at any rate \u2013 was that the live attendance at the track dropped by 3% year-on-year, dipping back below 300,000 to a total of 292,719 for the week, around 9,000 down on the 2018 figure of 301,818.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/23/frankie-dettori-royal-ascot-online-betting-bet365-skybet\">Frankie Dettori\u2019s Ascot exploits had online firms rushing to sell punters short | Greg Wood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The crowd for Saturday\u2019s card, which is now well-established as the biggest of the week, was slightly up at 75,316 \u2013 a sell-out, basically. But on the other four days of the meeting, attendance was down, and while the poor weather on Tuesday and Wednesday may have contributed to dips of 3.5% and 5% respectively, it cannot be blamed for the 5.2% drop, the biggest of the week in percentage terms, for Thursday\u2019s Gold Cup, which is still, in theory at least, the showpiece event of the week.</p> <p>There were 70,000 racegoers in attendance on Gold Cup day last year. This time around, it was 66,375, and while most other racecourses can only dream about having a problem like that, it is unlikely to pass without comment when the track\u2019s executives conduct their annual post-meeting review.</p> <p>Around 9,000 fewer racegoers over five days may not seem like much in the grand scheme, but Royal Ascot is already a little lop-sided over the course of the week, with around 45,000 and 40,000 arriving on Tuesday and Wednesday before the bumper crowds kick in for the final three days. The Thursday card, which is smack in the middle, needs to keep pace with Friday and Saturday, and not slowly start to drift towards the crowd figures for the earlier part of the week.</p> <p>There was, of course, a train strike on South West Trains during last week\u2019s meeting, which may have deterred some racegoers, though this daily commuter to the meeting found that the actual service was, if anything, better than usual.</p> <p>And it was a lot better and cheaper than the service Londoners endure to get to Cheltenham in March, when the bus from the station to the racecourse alone can easily add another hour to the journey. But Cheltenham\u2019s attendance is still growing and also much more even over the course of its four days.

      "bodyText": "The stories came thick and fast at Royal Ascot and the good news audience-wise was that ITV\u2019s viewing figures were impressive throughout the meeting. Thursday\u2019s numbers were particularly strong, presumably as word spread that Frankie Dettori was seizing control of the proceedings as only he can. The Thursday peak of 1.4m viewers was the highest for any afternoon at Royal Ascot for seven years (since the days when it was on the BBC, in other words). The peak figure also passed 1m on all five days of the meeting for the first time in ITV\u2019s three years with the rights. The bad news audience-wise \u2013 well, slightly disappointing news at any rate \u2013 was that the live attendance at the track dropped by 3% year-on-year, dipping back below 300,000 to a total of 292,719 for the week, around 9,000 down on the 2018 figure of 301,818. The crowd for Saturday\u2019s card, which is now well-established as the biggest of the week, was slightly up at 75,316 \u2013 a sell-out, basically. But on the other four days of the meeting, attendance was down, and while the poor weather on Tuesday and Wednesday may have contributed to dips of 3.5% and 5% respectively, it cannot be blamed for the 5.2% drop, the biggest of the week in percentage terms, for Thursday\u2019s Gold Cup, which is still, in theory at least, the showpiece event of the week. There were 70,000 racegoers in attendance on Gold Cup day last year. This time around, it was 66,375, and while most other racecourses can only dream about having a problem like that, it is unlikely to pass without comment when the track\u2019s executives conduct their annual post-meeting review. Around 9,000 fewer racegoers over five days may not seem like much in the grand scheme, but Royal Ascot is already a little lop-sided over the course of the week, with around 45,000 and 40,000 arriving on Tuesday and Wednesday before the bumper crowds kick in for the final three days. The Thursday card, which is smack in the middle, needs to keep pace with Friday and Saturday, and not slowly start to drift towards the crowd figures for the earlier part of the week. There was, of course, a train strike on South West Trains during last week\u2019s meeting, which may have deterred some racegoers, though this daily commuter to the meeting found that the actual service was, if anything, better than usual. And it was a lot better and cheaper than the service Londoners endure to get to Cheltenham in March, when the bus from the station to the racecourse alone can easily add another hour to the journey. But Cheltenham\u2019s attendance is still growing and also much more even over the course of its four days. This year, they got 67,973 on day one, with subsequent crowds of 59,209, 67,821 and 71,849. Cheltenham\u2019s daily average is already ahead of Royal Ascot\u2019s (66,700 this year against 58,543 for the Royal meeting). If it ever adds a fifth day to the Festival, it will be well ahead of Royal Ascot in terms of total attendance too. It is not a competition and racing is, of course, fortunate to have two hugely popular events as highlights of the Flat and jumping seasons. In terms of their appeal to spectators, though, it is Ascot which appears to have more work to do. Windsor, which is just down the road from its far grander near-neighbour, always pulls in a big crowd for its Monday evening meetings and several thousand racegoers will be heading down to the riverside venue for a seven-race card later today. Daschas (7.10) could well be the answer to the most valuable race on the card. Stuart Williams\u2019s five-year-old finished last in the Dash at Epsom on Derby day but did not look at ease on the track and has been dropped a useful 3lb since. His earlier win at Newmarket in mid-May gives him every chance here if he is back to anything like his best form. Fox Vardy (7.40) ran well on his belated return to action at Salisbury a couple of weeks ago and will take plenty of beating on the same card, while Princely (4.30) and Graceland (3.45) are the pick of the prices at Chepstow and Southwell respectively.",

We\u2019ve shared all this information with the select committee and Westminster and elsewhere. We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve also heard it claimed that that [Cambridge Analytica] data was used in the Brexit referendum here. In fact, the watchdog, the UK watchdog that has that data \u2026 firstly they said this last week, that there was no raw data from Facebook on the servers of Cambridge Analytica, but more than that, they have confirmed that no UK voter\u2019s Facebook data was involved.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg did not address allegations that Facebook\u2019s viral mechanics aid populist politics at the expense of more moderate campaigns, a theory cited by academics and researchers to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/29/populism-tinder-politics-swipe-left-or-right-unthinkingly\">explain the rise</a> of populism. But earlier this month, he dismissed those concerns as well, telling the Times\u2019s <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/times-comment/mcdonnell-gove-and-clegg\">Red Box podcast</a> that populism was \u201cnot new\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/timesredbox/46e37ee9-76c1-4090-aff9-15c378f0a652\">He added</a>: \u201cSocial media has something which is qualitatively new, which is scale and speed. What is not new is people coming up with bonkers ideas, or fake ideas, or indulging in extremist or populist points of view. That was not invented 15 years ago. Populism, extremism, conflict and division in society, particularly when you have, as we have had since 2008, profound economic and social shocks to society, I think people some times confuse symptom with cause.</p> <p>\u201cYou see a lot of the divisions in society played out on social media \u2026 When you look at the claims and counterclaims about the effect of social media on the US presidential elections in 2016, [you] discover that the thing that created the bubble effect was the feedback loop between the tweets of the then candidate Donald Trump and the media, cable TV.\u201d</p> <p>Clegg also argued the recent backlash against technology companies created \u201cthe risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly \u2026 Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\u201d</p> <p>Before he took the job at Facebook, but after the Brexit and US presidential votes, <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/nick-clegg-are-liberals-to-blame-that-hoax-news-is-swinging-elections-a3400886.html\">Clegg wrote</a> in the Evening Standard that he found \u201cthe messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating\u201d. However, even then, he argued \u201cpopulists know how to appeal to emotions in a way reasonable, measured liberals almost never do. So the politics of moderation needs to pack a bigger emotional punch. That\u2019s our problem \u2013 not Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s.\u201d</p>",

We have found no evidence of a significant attempt by outside forces. \u201cI\u2019ve also heard it claimed that that [Cambridge Analytica] data was used in the Brexit referendum here. In fact, the watchdog, the UK watchdog that has that data \u2026 firstly they said this last week, that there was no raw data from Facebook on the servers of Cambridge Analytica, but more than that, they have confirmed that no UK voter\u2019s Facebook data was involved.\u201d Clegg did not address allegations that Facebook\u2019s viral mechanics aid populist politics at the expense of more moderate campaigns, a theory cited by academics and researchers to explain the rise of populism. But earlier this month, he dismissed those concerns as well, telling the Times\u2019s Red Box podcast that populism was \u201cnot new\u201d. He added: \u201cSocial media has something which is qualitatively new, which is scale and speed. What is not new is people coming up with bonkers ideas, or fake ideas, or indulging in extremist or populist points of view. That was not invented 15 years ago. Populism, extremism, conflict and division in society, particularly when you have, as we have had since 2008, profound economic and social shocks to society, I think people some times confuse symptom with cause. \u201cYou see a lot of the divisions in society played out on social media \u2026 When you look at the claims and counterclaims about the effect of social media on the US presidential elections in 2016, [you] discover that the thing that created the bubble effect was the feedback loop between the tweets of the then candidate Donald Trump and the media, cable TV.\u201d Clegg also argued the recent backlash against technology companies created \u201cthe risk that we throw the baby out with the bathwater and make it almost impossible for tech to innovate properly \u2026 Technology is not good or bad. Technology down the ages is used by good and bad people for good and bad ends.\u201d Before he took the job at Facebook, but after the Brexit and US presidential votes, Clegg wrote in the Evening Standard that he found \u201cthe messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating\u201d. However, even then, he argued \u201cpopulists know how to appeal to emotions in a way reasonable, measured liberals almost never do. So the politics of moderation needs to pack a bigger emotional punch. That\u2019s our problem \u2013 not Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s.\u201d",

But the vast majority of it is either not recycled, unrecyclable, or doesn't get reused once it's been recycled. Volumes ending up in the natural environment are surging. Plastic can take as much as 500 years to decompose.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the implications?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Plastic is ubiquitous \u2013 and often deadly. It kills sea creatures that eat it but cannot digest it. It gets into the human food chain by contaminating the fish that we eat. It is even in our tap water. There is no science about the long-term impact of humans ingesting plastic.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is to be done?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Taxing plastic bags \u2013 or even banning them outright as Kenya has done \u2013 has changed consumer and producer behaviour. But what next? Deposit return schemes for plastic bottles work well in several countries. Charging for one-time coffee cups also seems to be on the agenda.

      "bodyText": "Boots will phase out all plastic bags from its stores by 2020, replacing them with brown paper bags. The health and beauty chain will remove 40m plastic bags a year from use, amounting to more than 900 tonnes of single-use plastic. From Monday, 53 Boots stores will no longer offer plastic bags at checkouts, a policy that will be extended to all its 2,485 outlets by early next year. Boots will charge customers for the new unbleached brown bags, even though they do not fall under the plastic bag tax, and will donate all profits to BBC Children in Need. Charges will be 5p, 7p and 10p, depending on size. Greenpeace welcomed the move but said retailers should encourage customers to shop with their own reusable bags. \u201cIf our oceans had a doctor, what they would order is a drastic cut in the amount of single-use plastic in circulation. So it\u2019s great to see a major high street brand like Boots listening to public concerns and ditching plastic bags,\u201d said Louise Edge, the head of Greenpeace UK\u2019s ocean plastics campaign. \u201cBut retailers need to be careful that by swapping plastic for paper they don\u2019t end up shifting the problem from our oceans to our forests. This is why as well as looking for new materials for their carrier bags, high street chains should also encourage their customers to bring their own reusable bags and truly tackle the throwaway culture that\u2019s damaging our living world.\u201d Helen Normoyle, the director of marketing at Boots UK, said: \u201cWe have seen a significant shift in our customers\u2019 attitudes towards plastics and recycling in recent years. \u201cOur new paper bags have been carefully tested to make sure that, over their entire life cycle, they are better for the environment, whilst still being a sturdy, practical option for customers who haven\u2019t brought their own bags with them when shopping.\u201d The Boots managing director, Sebastian James, said: \u201cPlastic waste is undoubtedly one of the most important issues around the world today, with TV shows like Blue Planet highlighting the effects of plastic pollution \u2026 The move to unbleached paper bags is another pivotal moment in that journey. \u201cThere is no doubt that our customers expect us to act and this change signifies a huge step away from our reliance on plastic.\u201d Boots has recently come under fire from Greenpeace and customers for using plastic bags to package some of its prescriptions. Last August, the company signed up to the UK Plastics Pact, a voluntary pledge by the retail industry to reduce single-use plastic packaging. Earlier this year, Morrisons started trialling large paper bags for groceries and raised the price of its plastic bags by 50%. Tesco moved to stop selling single-use 5p carrier bags in its UK stores in 2017 and instead offers shoppers reusable \u201cbags for life\u201d for 10p. Plastic bag sales at England\u2019s big seven supermarkets have dropped by 86% since the government introduced its 5p plastic bag charge in 2015, according to the latest figures. The data, published in July 2018 but due to be updated shortly, shows customers bought nearly 300m fewer bags in 2017-18 compared with the previous year.

However, retailers have been criticised for not acting sooner and moving more quickly to drastically reduce their use of plastic and packaging. As well as polluting the world\u2019s oceans, the production of single-use plastic accelerates climate change, a report by the Center for International Environmental Law warned last month. Trewin Restorick, the chief executive and co-founder of the environmental charity Hubbub, said: \u201cBoots is another in the growing line of retailers that has been forced to recognise that Blue Planet has fundamentally changed the way customers view the way they use plastics.

Why? We outsiders don\u2019t know, and we are not meant to know. \u201cA wink is all about collusion, and collusion is about exclusion,\u201d says Dr Peter Collett, an Oxford psychologist with an interest in body language.

As a mode of communication, it seems as quaint as Morse code. </p> <p>I am sufficiently interested in winking to have written a novel about a man who winks at people and then kills them. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/best-recent-crime-novels-review-roundup\" title=\"\">The novel</a> is set in the 70s, which was a lascivious decade, therefore well stocked with that sort of winker, but the main thing was to set the novel in the past.</p> <p>It seems to me that winking belongs in the past partly because society is increasingly informal, and the winker needs formality in order to have something to undermine. There would be no point winking at someone in the middle of an orgy, for instance. (When I ran this idea past Collett, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it, Andrew.\u201d)</p> <p>Perhaps the heyday of winking was in the risque entertainment of a century ago, when comedians tackled social strictures with a sort of constrained rebellion, via such outmoded notions as cheekiness, naughtiness and mischievousness. The ventriloquist\u2019s figure was a \u201ccheeky boy\u201d and a winking mechanism came almost as standard. To quote an Edwardian advertisement: \u201cIn addition to all the ordinary movements, the \u2018Wonderful Boy\u2019 is constructed to laugh, cry, smoke, wink and flap his ears.\u201d On the music hall stage, the wink and the double entendre were natural companions. The singer Marie Lloyd was known for her wink, and in 1895 she had a hit with a song called When You Wink the Other Eye, a title suggesting that winking had reached such epidemic proportions that everyone\u2019s first-choice winking eye had become worn out. The song gets progressively lewder, culminating in a scenario wherein a cash-strapped woman flags down a cab and makes a suggestion to the driver \u2026</p> <p><em>\u201cHer purse, alas! Is empty, but somehow she must get there;</em><br><em>She whispers something in his ear, then it\u2019s </em><em>\u2018Drive to Leicester Square.</em><em>\u2019</em><br><em>\u2018All right \u2013 jump in!</em><em>\u2019 says cabby \u2013 oh, </em><em>\u2018Cabby knows his fare,</em><em>\u2019</em><br><em>For he winks the other eye.\u201d</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ffe8780b96b52ae161d59f02cd92f52758086226\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffe8780b96b52ae161d59f02cd92f52758086226/0_0_3881_5413/717.jpg\" alt=\"The singer Marie Lloyd was known for her wink.\" width=\"717\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The singer Marie Lloyd was known for her wink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The American silent screen had its famous female winkers. One was Cissy Fitzgerald, who had an involuntary wink in her left eye, which she incorporated into her act. This tic apparently caused her some distress, but it has been suggested that Fitzgerald\u2019s wink also makes her a feminist icon, in that winking was seen as a male prerogative. </p> <p>If the music hall wink was exclusionary, it perhaps excluded the people who merited exclusion: the controlling middle and upper classes; the people not in the music hall audience. In the 70s, my dad was a master of the exclusionary wink from a similarly leftwing angle, in that the person he was excluding tended to be my uncle Peter. Uncle Peter was a Tory and a keen motorist (he owned driving gloves and a car coat), who regularly suggested to my dad \u2013 who worked for British Rail \u2013 that funding for railways should be slashed to the bone. \u201cYou make a good point, Peter,\u201d my dad would say; then he would wink at me, which I found flattering, given that I was only about 10 years old.</p> <p>When I mentioned my dad\u2019s winks to Marina Benjamin, author of feminist titles such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/23/the-middlepause-on-turning-fifty-marina-benjamin-in-my-own-time-jane-miller-review\" title=\"\">The Middlepause</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/26/insomnia-by-marina-benjamin-review-sleeplessness\" title=\"\">Insomnia</a>, she was well disposed: \u201cI think that\u2019s nice, as long as the third party didn\u2019t see the wink.\u201d I assured her there was no question of that. We then moved on to the lascivious wink, and she was less indulgent: \u201cThat wink \u2013 the Benny Hill wink \u2013 says to a woman: \u2018You\u2019re game, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 so it\u2019s demeaning because it bypasses all kinds of mutual communication. It is a shorthand by men \u2013 and always men you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with, by the way.\u201d</p> <p>I asked at what point she thought that sort of wink became insupportable. \u201cWhen feminism began,\u201d she said, laughing, which is not to say it has quite disappeared: \u201cIt happens all the time on public transport.\u201d Did Benjamin think women ever winked at men? \u201cPass,\u201d she said. \u201cCan\u2019t think of an example.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, I have never been winked at by a woman unknown to me. I would have remembered, just as I would have remembered if I had been involved in an earthquake. But I can confirm that men are still winking at women they don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve seen it done. The winker does usually seem a marginal figure, like someone mentally living in the past. The last time I saw a man wink at a woman in a pub, they had been introduced immediately beforehand: that is, the man had marched over and unilaterally introduced himself to the woman, whereupon he embarked on five minutes of boasting, culminating in: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a nice new Range Rover for sale around the corner if you\u2019re interested,\u201d followed by the wink.</p> <p>Woody Allen took flak for saying he hoped the allegations against Harvey Weinstein would not lead to a \u201cwitch-hunt atmosphere\u201d in which <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/woody-allen-wink-women-workplace-harvey-weinstein-witch-hunt-sexual-harassment-a8004876.html\" title=\"\">winking at a woman in the workplace</a> became wholly unacceptable. In response, Peter Bradshaw wrote<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/18/rose-mcgowan-tweet-harvey-weinstein-blake-poem-poison-tree\" title=\"\"> on this website</a>: \u201cThe only people that can get away with winking are the paradoxically supercool young people on the front of i-D magazine \u2026 Winking went out with cardboard bus tickets.\u201d The middle-aged winker seems to be using the old-media equivalent of the winking emoji or its typographical equivalent ;-). These I have received from women and my pulse rate has remained steady.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ec4363f4e41d4b6111c46736d1a921a9688005cd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec4363f4e41d4b6111c46736d1a921a9688005cd/0_0_5000_3333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018He seemed to be winking at the whole of Britain.\u2019 Julian Assange arrive at Westminster magistrates court in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He seemed to be winking at the whole of Britain.\u2019 Julian Assange arrive at Westminster magistrates court in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Taylor/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.talkbodylanguage.co.uk/\" title=\"\">India Ford</a> is an internationally renowned body language consultant.

Lessons from Clinton, Corbyn and Rihanna</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here is an instance of a momentous wink. In the quarter final of the 2006 World Cup, Wayne Rooney committed a foul, and Cristiano Ronaldo urged the referee to send him off, which he did. Ronaldo then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/oct/09/wayne-rooney-portugal-cristiano-ronaldo\" title=\"\">winked at the Portugal bench</a>. When the BBC pundits watched the playback, one of them exclaimed off-camera: \u201cHang on \u2013 did he just wink?\u201d It was the wink that made Alan Shearer lose his cool: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wayne went into the Portuguese dressing room after the game and stuck one on him.\u201d</p> <p>Ronaldo\u2019s wink distorted his beautiful face. A woman I know thinks a man who winks at a woman might be forgiven because he is at that moment sacrificing his good looks (if any); he is making a \u201cfunny\u201d face. In 2014, Elle magazine ran a<a href=\"https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g8359/awkward-celebrity-winks/\" title=\"\"> feature about bad winking</a> and it turns out winking doesn\u2019t suit George Clooney or Catherine Zeta-Jones, for instance. But are these bad winks amusing?</p> <p>It seems clear that one should never use a wink to demand a laugh. Welcoming the Queen to the US in 2007, George W Bush fluffed his lines, saying: \u201cYou helped this country celebrate its bicentennial in 17 \u2026 1976.\u201d He then turned and directed a stage wink at her, as if to say: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a twit but you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d Her Majesty remained expressionless. That goes down as one of the more recent examples of a famous wink. Another occurred the following year, when \u2013 to the dismay of her supporters and detractors alike \u2013 Sarah Palin <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/04/uselections2008.sarahpalin\" title=\"\">winked three times</a> at the TV camera during a vice-presidential debate.</p> <p>This was a strange wink, in that it was apparently not exclusionary. Palin was presuming to wink at the whole of the US, just as Julian Assange seemed to be winking at the whole of Britain (he was said to have winked at \u201cthe cameras\u201d, plural) when he arrived at court in a prison van recently. Collett says that, since a wink is \u201ca narrowcast communication between me and you\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/04/11/uk-has-sought-assurances-julian-assange-will-not-face-death/\" title=\"\">Assange\u2019s wink</a> was \u201cmisapplied\u201d (which is the least of Assange\u2019s problems right now).</p> <p>But surely winkers deserve some sliver of credit for their boldness? The winker always expresses bravado, no matter how their subtler message might go astray. A wink is a reset or jump cut, and usually a leap in the dark; things will be different after the wink. When Lee Jones, the antihero of my novel, winks at a woman, she asks what it meant, to which he replies: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what it meant, shall we?\u201d</p> <p><em>Andrew Martin\u2019s novel The Winker is </em><em>published by Corsair.</em></p>",

(When I ran this idea past Collett, he said: \u201cI\u2019ll take your word for it, Andrew.\u201d) Perhaps the heyday of winking was in the risque entertainment of a century ago, when comedians tackled social strictures with a sort of constrained rebellion, via such outmoded notions as cheekiness, naughtiness and mischievousness. The ventriloquist\u2019s figure was a \u201ccheeky boy\u201d and a winking mechanism came almost as standard. To quote an Edwardian advertisement: \u201cIn addition to all the ordinary movements, the \u2018Wonderful Boy\u2019 is constructed to laugh, cry, smoke, wink and flap his ears.\u201d On the music hall stage, the wink and the double entendre were natural companions. The singer Marie Lloyd was known for her wink, and in 1895 she had a hit with a song called When You Wink the Other Eye, a title suggesting that winking had reached such epidemic proportions that everyone\u2019s first-choice winking eye had become worn out. The song gets progressively lewder, culminating in a scenario wherein a cash-strapped woman flags down a cab and makes a suggestion to the driver \u2026 \u201cHer purse, alas! Is empty, but somehow she must get there; She whispers something in his ear, then it\u2019s \u2018Drive to Leicester Square.\u2019 \u2018All right \u2013 jump in!\u2019 says cabby \u2013 oh, \u2018Cabby knows his fare,\u2019 For he winks the other eye.\u201d The American silent screen had its famous female winkers. One was Cissy Fitzgerald, who had an involuntary wink in her left eye, which she incorporated into her act. This tic apparently caused her some distress, but it has been suggested that Fitzgerald\u2019s wink also makes her a feminist icon, in that winking was seen as a male prerogative. If the music hall wink was exclusionary, it perhaps excluded the people who merited exclusion: the controlling middle and upper classes; the people not in the music hall audience. In the 70s, my dad was a master of the exclusionary wink from a similarly leftwing angle, in that the person he was excluding tended to be my uncle Peter. Uncle Peter was a Tory and a keen motorist (he owned driving gloves and a car coat), who regularly suggested to my dad \u2013 who worked for British Rail \u2013 that funding for railways should be slashed to the bone. \u201cYou make a good point, Peter,\u201d my dad would say; then he would wink at me, which I found flattering, given that I was only about 10 years old. When I mentioned my dad\u2019s winks to Marina Benjamin, author of feminist titles such as The Middlepause and Insomnia, she was well disposed: \u201cI think that\u2019s nice, as long as the third party didn\u2019t see the wink.\u201d I assured her there was no question of that. We then moved on to the lascivious wink, and she was less indulgent: \u201cThat wink \u2013 the Benny Hill wink \u2013 says to a woman: \u2018You\u2019re game, aren\u2019t you?\u2019 so it\u2019s demeaning because it bypasses all kinds of mutual communication. It is a shorthand by men \u2013 and always men you don\u2019t want to have anything to do with, by the way.\u201d I asked at what point she thought that sort of wink became insupportable. \u201cWhen feminism began,\u201d she said, laughing, which is not to say it has quite disappeared: \u201cIt happens all the time on public transport.\u201d Did Benjamin think women ever winked at men? \u201cPass,\u201d she said. \u201cCan\u2019t think of an example.\u201d Certainly, I have never been winked at by a woman unknown to me. I would have remembered, just as I would have remembered if I had been involved in an earthquake. But I can confirm that men are still winking at women they don\u2019t know because I\u2019ve seen it done. The winker does usually seem a marginal figure, like someone mentally living in the past. The last time I saw a man wink at a woman in a pub, they had been introduced immediately beforehand: that is, the man had marched over and unilaterally introduced himself to the woman, whereupon he embarked on five minutes of boasting, culminating in: \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got a nice new Range Rover for sale around the corner if you\u2019re interested,\u201d followed by the wink. Woody Allen took flak for saying he hoped the allegations against Harvey Weinstein would not lead to a \u201cwitch-hunt atmosphere\u201d in which winking at a woman in the workplace became wholly unacceptable. In response, Peter Bradshaw wrote on this website: \u201cThe only people that can get away with winking are the paradoxically supercool young people on the front of i-D magazine \u2026 Winking went out with cardboard bus tickets.\u201d The middle-aged winker seems to be using the old-media equivalent of the winking emoji or its typographical equivalent ;-). These I have received from women and my pulse rate has remained steady. India Ford is an internationally renowned body language consultant. She suggests that a wink is powerful \u201cbecause it\u2019s a physical signal, and these are more telling than verbal ones; also because it comes from the eyes, and we send more communication with the eyes than any other way. I mean, imagine the effect on you of a very severe eye roll.\u201d Here is an instance of a momentous wink. In the quarter final of the 2006 World Cup, Wayne Rooney committed a foul, and Cristiano Ronaldo urged the referee to send him off, which he did. Ronaldo then winked at the Portugal bench. When the BBC pundits watched the playback, one of them exclaimed off-camera: \u201cHang on \u2013 did he just wink?\u201d It was the wink that made Alan Shearer lose his cool: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Wayne went into the Portuguese dressing room after the game and stuck one on him.\u201d Ronaldo\u2019s wink distorted his beautiful face. A woman I know thinks a man who winks at a woman might be forgiven because he is at that moment sacrificing his good looks (if any); he is making a \u201cfunny\u201d face. In 2014, Elle magazine ran a feature about bad winking and it turns out winking doesn\u2019t suit George Clooney or Catherine Zeta-Jones, for instance. But are these bad winks amusing? It seems clear that one should never use a wink to demand a laugh. Welcoming the Queen to the US in 2007, George W Bush fluffed his lines, saying: \u201cYou helped this country celebrate its bicentennial in 17 \u2026 1976.\u201d He then turned and directed a stage wink at her, as if to say: \u201cI\u2019m a bit of a twit but you don\u2019t mind, do you?\u201d Her Majesty remained expressionless. That goes down as one of the more recent examples of a famous wink. Another occurred the following year, when \u2013 to the dismay of her supporters and detractors alike \u2013 Sarah Palin winked three times at the TV camera during a vice-presidential debate. This was a strange wink, in that it was apparently not exclusionary. Palin was presuming to wink at the whole of the US, just as Julian Assange seemed to be winking at the whole of Britain (he was said to have winked at \u201cthe cameras\u201d, plural) when he arrived at court in a prison van recently. Collett says that, since a wink is \u201ca narrowcast communication between me and you\u201d, Assange\u2019s wink was \u201cmisapplied\u201d (which is the least of Assange\u2019s problems right now). But surely winkers deserve some sliver of credit for their boldness? The winker always expresses bravado, no matter how their subtler message might go astray. A wink is a reset or jump cut, and usually a leap in the dark; things will be different after the wink. When Lee Jones, the antihero of my novel, winks at a woman, she asks what it meant, to which he replies: \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see what it meant, shall we?\u201d Andrew Martin\u2019s novel The Winker is published by Corsair.",

Moon\u2019s journey has taken him to the Royal Marines, on tour in Afghanistan, through life-changing injuries, and even a career as a professional golfer. \u201cI joined the marines in 2006 and was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009,\u201d Moon says. \u201cWe were on a routine patrol and the vehicle went down a ditch where there was an IED [improvised explosive device] planted.\u201d Moon nonchalantly reveals the scale of what happened next. \u201cSmashed right heel bone, broken bones in my right leg, dislocated both knees, broken left femur, broken hip, dislocated pelvis, broken back and a ruptured spleen.\u201d A painstaking year of rehab followed, before Moon made a decision that would change his life for ever. \u201cThey kept trying to fix my right leg up but couldn\u2019t \u2013 so they gave me the chance to either spend my life in a wheelchair and on crutches, or have the leg cut off. It was a no-brainer; just get it off and let me get on with my life. \u201cI had it done and got a medical discharge from the marines. It was almost like a relief. I was surrounded by double and triple amputees and they were running and things like that \u2013 they were just further advanced than I was. They were a lot better off, and as soon as they gave me the option I said, \u2018Let\u2019s do it\u2019, and there was no looking back.\u201d Moon left the marines to become a personal trainer, helping those, like himself, with disabilities. But having played rugby before his injuries, the opportunity to play competitive sport remained unfulfilled until he embarked on another change of career. \u201cI started playing golf because I couldn\u2019t do rugby, and became a PGA-registered professional in 2015. I did three years as a pro, and it was very interesting. I worked at Bolton golf club, coaching while playing in local PGA events. But in 2018 everything changed again.\u201d That was the year rugby league launched a competition for players with physical disabilities \u2013 and it immediately caught Moon\u2019s attention. \u201cI played league as a kid, and I managed to get a summer at Leigh Centurions before I broke my collarbone. The PGA were great with me, but after seeing the adverts for Wigan\u2019s PDRL team \u2026 to find out I could play full-contact rugby again was incredible. Golf was great but it just didn\u2019t scratch that itch properly.\u201d Moon walked away from life as a golfer to become one of the first PDRL players, returning to work as a personal trainer for a day job. \u201cThe concept is amazing,\u201d he says. Moon is a frustrated spectator at present because of injury, but he will be at Wigan next weekend when they honour those who have risked their lives as he did, in their annual Armed Forces Day celebrations. \u201cI\u2019ve been across the world, I\u2019ve played at Twickenham in front of 70,000 people before \u2026 but coming here with the Wigan badge on your chest is far scarier,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cGet down to a training session if you\u2019re eligible to play, and if you\u2019re not disabled, get down and watch. The standard is ridiculous. PDRL is only going to get bigger and it\u2019s an honour to be part of.\u201d",

Other neighbours said they had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/23/boris-johnson-more-neighbours-confirm-tear-up-with-partner-carrie-symonds\">considered calling police</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe very prospect of someone taping someone in their private home, frankly, tells me that is politically motivated,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAnd that is not the type of behaviour that you would expect in our country.

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Hunt has stepped up his criticism of Boris Johnson for avoiding media scrutiny in the Tory leadership campaign, calling it \u201cdisrespectful\u201d, as another minister said Johnson could be brought down by his own MPs if he pushed for a no-deal Brexit. Tobias Ellwood, the junior defence minister, said it was possible that the decision by Johnson actively to seek no deal could push some Conservatives to support a no-confidence motion against his government. \u201cI believe that absolutely is the case,\u201d Ellwood told the BBC. \u201cI think a dozen or so members of parliament would be on our side, would be voting against supporting a no deal and that would include ministers as well as backbenchers.\u201d Following a hugely difficult weekend for the Johnson campaign, dominated by questions about why police were called to his home after an argument with his partner, Carrie Symonds, allies of the former foreign secretary sought to fight his corner. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who supported Johnson after abandoning his own leadership bid, said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to accuse the frontrunner of avoiding scrutiny, saying he was taking part in dozens of Conservative hustings events. Priti Patel, the former international development secretary and another leading Johnson supporter, told the BBC that Johnson was facing \u201ca very clear, politically motivated series of attacks\u201d over the incident on Thursday night at the London home he shares with Symonds. Johnson has refused to comment on the circumstances of a furious row that led one neighbour to record some of the shouting from inside his flat, and informed the Guardian about the incident. Other neighbours said they had considered calling police. \u201cThe very prospect of someone taping someone in their private home, frankly, tells me that is politically motivated,\u201d Patel said. \u201cAnd that is not the type of behaviour that you would expect in our country. It\u2019s the type of behaviour associated with the old Eastern Bloc.\u201d Patel said such incidents were \u201cvery much there to deflect upon the fact he is a Brexit candidate\u201d. She said: \u201cQuite frankly this has now become very much, I think, remain versus leave, and a personal attack and campaign against Boris.\u201d Speaking earlier to Sky News, Hunt declined to comment on the incident with Symonds, saying only: \u201cHe\u2019s got to decide what he says about his private life.\u201d But Hunt was scathing about Johnson\u2019s decision to avoid almost all media interviews and debates, calling it \u201cvery disrespectful to Conservative party members\u201d. Johnson has agreed to take part in an ITV event on 9 July, by which point party members will have received their ballots. But he is avoiding a planned Sky debate on Tuesday. \u201cI\u2019m saying that it is cowardice, frankly, not to appear in head-to-head debates against me,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cYou can\u2019t become prime minister without answering questions about the decisions you\u2019re going to have to take almost immediately you get through the door of No 10. My worry is that Boris has got a coalition of people like Matt Hancock, who want no deal taken off the table, and Mark Francois, who wants no deal \u2013 that coalition will dissolve very, very quickly indeed when he has to take some actual decisions. \u201cSometimes in politics you can fudge, but on Brexit you can\u2019t. There are going to have to be decisions, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s very important that the new prime minister has a mandate from having spelled out exactly what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d Hunt also accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward, Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the Times.

Hancock added: \u201cOf course, the question of whether Boris\u2019s private life is private is, perfectly reasonably, up to him.

That I was part of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23GalQaeda&amp;src=typd\" title=\"\">#GalQaeda</a>? To be fair, GalQaeda is a hilarious hashtag. Maybe we should let men do comedy.</p> <p>I can\u2019t speak for ITV but as far as I understand it, nothing has been \u201cbanned\u201d. ITV\u2019s comedy commissioner, the excellent Saskia Schuster, has launched an initiative, <a href=\"https://comedy5050.com/about\" title=\"\">Comedy 50:50</a>, to move away from all-male writers\u2019 rooms \u2013 and has changed ITV contracts so shows must aim towards equal gender representation. If you don\u2019t know what a writers\u2019 room is, (congratulations, you\u2019ve made better life choices than me), it\u2019s a group of writers, usually put together by producers in order to write jokes for a sketch or entertainment show or create stories for a sitcom. Historically they have been male-dominated, and I admire Saskia\u2019s attempts to draw in more much-needed female voices. (And I\u2019m not just saying that so she\u2019ll commission the sitcom I pitch her next month \u2013 working title: GalQaeda.)</p> <p>The reaction online revealed an uncomfortable truth: some people are terrified of inclusion. On the one hand, I get it. If TV comedy was an antelope you were eating and some female writers came along and started eating the antelope too \u2026 there\u2019d be less antelope for you. I\u2019d understand that you might be chagrined. But \u2013 and I know this sounds crazy \u2013 TV writing is NOT an antelope. More varied voices create better comedy. And better comedy creates an appetite for MORE comedy. It serves everyone in television when shows go well. Great shows beget great shows, we\u2019ve all seen it happen. After you loved Fleabag, didn\u2019t you crave more shows like it? Success feeds the industry. Even if Fleabag\u2019s sexy priest left us all on our knees, horny and confused. </p> <p>When certain people hear that there\u2019s to be an end of \u201call-male writers\u2019 rooms\u201d, they don\u2019t hear \u201cthis will be better for everyone\u201d. They hear \u201csomething is being taken away from you\u201d. As the saying goes: when you\u2019re accustomed to privilege, sometimes equality feels like oppression.</p> <p>The big (misguided) belief is that the men already in the writers\u2019 room \u201cdeserve to be there\u201d and the new women don\u2019t. That\u2019s a myth. Everyone who has ever worked in TV got there because someone opened a door for them. If they can\u2019t do the job they won\u2019t last long. This is just about giving more people a chance in a system that has not, until now, been designed to do so. Is that really such a big ask? (Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll still get paid less.) I understand that headlines are designed to grab our attention and make us click, but it\u2019s annoying when a good news story is framed as a bad one. If I, a lowly comedy writer, could make a gentle suggestion: not everything has to be a culture war. Not every conversation has to have two polar views with no room for nuance. Life <em>is</em> nuance. (OK, that \u201clife is nuance\u201d sentence is a bit on the nose, but don\u2019t worry: I\u2019ll get a room of men to rewrite it later).</p> <p>For the sake of the future of comedy, hire more varied writers. And I don\u2019t just mean female writers: hire more writers of colour, more queer, disabled, trans, working-class writers, maybe even some vegan writers \u2026 And look, I can only take on the world one article at a time, but how about we open this attitude of inclusion to all industries? To all people? Remember, if they\u2019re not good enough, they\u2019ll quickly fall away. But if they are good enough, it will make the work better and stronger. For all of us.</p> <p>Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get back to writing my GalQaeda pitch \u2013 which Andrew Lloyd Webber has already agreed to score.</p> <p>\u2022 Brona C Titley is a TV comedy writer and actor</p>",

After you loved Fleabag, didn\u2019t you crave more shows like it? Success feeds the industry. Even if Fleabag\u2019s sexy priest left us all on our knees, horny and confused. When certain people hear that there\u2019s to be an end of \u201call-male writers\u2019 rooms\u201d, they don\u2019t hear \u201cthis will be better for everyone\u201d. They hear \u201csomething is being taken away from you\u201d. As the saying goes: when you\u2019re accustomed to privilege, sometimes equality feels like oppression. The big (misguided) belief is that the men already in the writers\u2019 room \u201cdeserve to be there\u201d and the new women don\u2019t. That\u2019s a myth. Everyone who has ever worked in TV got there because someone opened a door for them. If they can\u2019t do the job they won\u2019t last long. This is just about giving more people a chance in a system that has not, until now, been designed to do so. Is that really such a big ask? (Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll still get paid less.) I understand that headlines are designed to grab our attention and make us click, but it\u2019s annoying when a good news story is framed as a bad one. If I, a lowly comedy writer, could make a gentle suggestion: not everything has to be a culture war. Not every conversation has to have two polar views with no room for nuance. Life is nuance. (OK, that \u201clife is nuance\u201d sentence is a bit on the nose, but don\u2019t worry: I\u2019ll get a room of men to rewrite it later). For the sake of the future of comedy, hire more varied writers. And I don\u2019t just mean female writers: hire more writers of colour, more queer, disabled, trans, working-class writers, maybe even some vegan writers \u2026 And look, I can only take on the world one article at a time, but how about we open this attitude of inclusion to all industries? To all people? Remember, if they\u2019re not good enough, they\u2019ll quickly fall away. But if they are good enough, it will make the work better and stronger. For all of us. Now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I need to get back to writing my GalQaeda pitch \u2013 which Andrew Lloyd Webber has already agreed to score. \u2022 Brona C Titley is a TV comedy writer and actor",

      "bodyText": "Israel Folau has hit out at the decision to shut down his crowdfunding page \u2013 which was intended to cover the costs of his legal challenge against Rugby Australia \u2013 saying it is evidence of a mounting campaign of discrimination against him and that his website has faced cyber-attacks. Folau\u2019s fundraising page for his court action has been removed for breaching GoFundMe\u2019s terms of service, the digital fundraising platform said, with all donors to be refunded. A spokesman for Folau characterised GoFundMe\u2019s decision to take down his fundraising campaign as \u201cvery disappointing\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately, GoFundMe has buckled to demands against the freedom of Australians to donate to his cause,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThere appears to be a continuing campaign of discrimination against Israel and his supporters.\u201d The rugby star had collected more than $750,000 as of Sunday night as he sought donations from the public for his legal fight, with a $3m target. \u201cThankfully, several organisations have already expressed interest in supporting Israel\u2019s efforts to raise money for his ongoing legal case,\u201d a spokesman said. Folau had his $4m employment contract terminated in May after he made social media posts saying \u201chell awaits\u201d homosexuals, which were deemed in breach of its code of conduct, and after previous warnings from Rugby Australia not to denigrate people on the basis of their sexuality. The player announced he would challenge the decision in court and set up a GoFundMe account asking for donations to \u201cstand up for the word of God\u201d. His spokesman said the former Wallaby was grateful to the 10,000 plus people who had believed in good faith their donations would aid his case. He said Folau\u2019s website had come under \u201csustained cyber-attack\u201d and there had been a \u201cdeliberate attempt to vilify his wife Maria for supporting her husband\u201d. \u201cWhile Israel does not intend to respond in detail at this time regarding the accusations thrown at him or his family he wants it known that these attacks have hardened his resolve,\u201d the spokesman said. GoFundMe Australia removed the crowdfunding page on Monday. \u201cAs a company, we are absolutely committed to the fight for equality for LGBTIQ+ people and fostering an environment of inclusivity,\u201d its manager, Nicola Britton, said. Rugby Australia\u2019s chief executive, Raelene Castle, said: \u201cFrom our perspective [GoFundMe] is a place where sick children get support, so it\u2019s certainly not a strategy we think is appropriate.\u201d The controversy has also extended to Folau\u2019s wife, Maria, who plays netball for the Adelaide Thunderbirds. She reposted her husband\u2019s GoFundMeCampaign on social media. \u201cWhile Netball SA in no way endorses the reposting, we do not believe Maria has contravened our social media policy,\u201d Netball South Australia\u2019s chief executive, Bronwyn Klei said in a statement. \u201cMaria is a key member of the Thunderbirds. Not only has she provided great strength and leadership on court, she attends and works with netballing clinics, spends a lot of time with fans, engages with local communities and passionately encourages young kids with their netball dreams. We continue to support her as we support all our players.\u201d Klei clarified her organisation does not endorse the repost and is committed to diversity and inclusion. Netball great Liz Ellis was furious with the code\u2019s response. \u201cAs much as I love watching \u2066Maria Folau play netball I do not want my sport endorsing the views of her husband,\u201d Ellis tweeted.",

Do you: a) Assume the owner must rich enough to award a sizeable finder\u2019s fee and seek out identification (go to 4) b) Walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) 4. Uh-oh! The wallet belongs to Boris Johnson. Do you: a) Return the wallet to Boris Johnson (go to 5) b) Rifle through the wallet for state secrets with which to blackmail him (go to 6) c) Walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) 5. You hand the wallet to Boris Johnson, and he takes it without giving you a reward. Do you: a) Shrug because you did the right thing all along (RESULT: You are as honest as you could possibly be) b) Grab his bicycle and hurl it into the nearest river (RESULT: You are still technically honest, but also quite spiteful in a generally amusing way) 6. The wallet contains a folded-up note from Vladimir Putin saying: \u201cThis is a receipt for helping you in the Conservative leadership competition.\u201d Do you: a) Go to the press (go to 8) b) Go to Boris Johnson (go to 9) c) Walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) 7. You wake up with a terrible hangover. What now? a) Return the wallet to Boris Johnson and tell him it was empty when you found it (RESULT: You are essentially dishonest, but your dishonesty is balanced out by a morality that manifests itself in self-hatred) b) Vomit in the wallet and throw it in the bin (RESULT: Dishonest) 8. The press is hugely interested in the story but doesn\u2019t pay its sources. Do you: a) Let them have the story anyway because the truth always outweighs financial gain (go to 10) b) Tell them to bugger off, walk straight to the pub and spend the lot getting blackout drunk on imported vodka (go to 7) 9. Boris Johnson tries to buy your silence. Do you: a) Take the money (RESULT: You are rich but terrible) b) Realise the severity of the matter, change your mind and go to the press (go to 8) 10. Boris Johnson is arrested for treason There is another leadership competition. Michael Gove wins. RESULT: You did the right thing, but everything ended badly anyway because this is 2019 and everything always ends badly. \u2022 Stuart Heritage writes about film, TV and music for the Guardian",

But Ley has been criticised for suggesting a long-delayed recovery plan for the possum should also consider the needs of the timber industry. The possum, which was believed extinct until 1961 and is endemic to the Victorian central highlands, was listed as critically endangered in 2015 when then environment minister Greg Hunt accepted the advice of an independent scientific advisory body. But the government is yet to release a formal recovery plan for the species and its conservation status has been subject to a review since 2017, when Barnaby Joyce led a call for a \u201cpeople before possums\u201d approach to prevent forestry job losses. Scientists estimate the number of Leadbeater\u2019s possums has declined more than 80% since the mid-1980s as its habitat, mostly old-growth mountain ash, has been devastated by a combination of fire and logging. Almost half of it was lost in the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires. Victoria\u2019s state-owned timber agency, VicForests, says it is managing protection of the possum appropriately and many new colonies of the animal have been found in recent years. Ley told the ABC on Monday that she was \u201cencouraged by the forestry\u2019s willingness to engage in the possum\u2019s survival\u201d.

She said it was important to strike a balance between conservation and the timber industry. \u201cI look forward to a recovery plan that takes into account the needs of that timber industry,\u201d she said. The Australian Conservation Foundation nature campaigner Jess Abrahams welcomed the minister\u2019s decision, but said the recovery plan must prioritise the environment \u201cThe science is really clear.

VicForests corporate affairs general manager Alex Messina said the organisation believed the possum could be protected while addressing both industry and environmental needs. He said it had been at the forefront of Leadbeater\u2019s possum research, helping identify hundreds of new colonies and extending knowledge about the possum\u2019s habitat. \u201cWe support undertaking further research to gain a greater understanding of Leadbeater\u2019s Possum numbers and where they live,\u201d he said. Environment group the Friends of the Leadbeater\u2019s Possum has launched a federal court challenge to VicForests\u2019 plans to log 41 forest coupes said to be vital habitat for the possum and the vulnerable greater glider.

The foreign secretary followed cabinet ministers, backbenchers and a major party donor in demanding that the frontrunner to succeed Theresa May speak out about the loud, late-night altercation with his partner, Carrie Symonds, which was heard by several neighbours. Hunt intervened as Johnson came under pressure on several fronts: \u2022 Two other cabinet ministers demanded that Johnson explain what happened on Friday. \u2022 A senior member of the 1922 Committee called for \u201copenness\u201d from anyone standing to be prime minister. \u2022 A party donor expressed concerns about the argument, saying it would damage their long-term prospects. Hunt\u2019s comment over Johnson\u2019s refusal to engage with the media will be seen as a coded reference to his opponent\u2019s appearance at Saturday\u2019s leadership race hustings, in which he stonewalled persistent questions about the incident, which took place early on Friday. The former mayor of London is due to take part in a digital hustings with Tory party members on Monday and has refused to say if he will face Hunt in a televised Sky News debate on Tuesday. Hunt suggested Johnson shied away from scrutiny, telling Sky News: \u201cThis is an audition to be prime minister of the UK \u2026 If Boris is refusing to answer questions in the media, refusing to do live debates then of course people are thinking: just who are we going to get as PM?\u201d Hunt also accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in Monday\u2019s edition of the Times.

Police confirmed they were called to the couple\u2019s south London flat after an argument was heard by neighbours, who reported slamming and banging, and added that at one point Symonds could be heard telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. A poll conducted at the weekend showed support for Johnson had fallen sharply following the incident. His eight-point lead earlier in the week had fallen to three points behind Hunt. Among Tory voters, when asked who would make the best prime minister, Johnson\u2019s lead had slumped from 27% to 11% in the same period, according to Survation, which carried out the polls for the Mail on Sunday. The neighbour who contacted the police, Tom Penn, issued a statement saying that he wanted to put the record straight on his reasons for recording the argument and calling 999. Penn, a playwright, said he acted only as a last resort and that he was speaking out because he was concerned by the \u201cbizarre and fictitious allegations\u201d made about him and his wife. Several Tory MPs have criticised the actions of Penn and claimed that his complaint was politically motivated because his partner has expressed hostility on social media towards Johnson. According to the Mail, Symonds described the recordings as a \u201cpolitical stitch up\u201d. But Penn has said they were motivated only by concern for the welfare of those in the flat. Dame Vera Baird, who will become the next victims\u2019 commissioner of England and Wales on Monday, told the Guardian that neighbours were right to contact the police with their concerns. \u201cI am in no doubt at all that given what they [the neighbours] said they heard, they should have done what they did \u2013 knock on the door, and try and offer any personal help, and then, when they got no reply, call the police. That is what the women\u2019s sector want potential witnesses to do,\u201d she said. \u201cI think its absolutely in the public interest that people do.\u201d In a further development, fellow Vote Leave campaigner and defence secretary Penny Mordaunt has urged Tory activists to \u201cturn away from Boris\u201d \u2013 a candidate who \u201ccreates drama\u201d. \u201cThe case before the members of the Conservative party is straightforward. A character? Or someone with character?\u201d she wrote in the Daily Express. Johnson has so far declined to comment on the incident. In his Monday column for the Telegraph he focussed on delivering Brexit by Halloween. The Daily Mail claimed that, according to friends of the former foreign secretary, the couple have spent the weekend away from their flat to avoid protesters and their \u201cloving and doting\u201d relationship is \u201cstronger than ever\u201d.",

Corporations often mimic each other\u2019s solutions to industry- or economy-wide problems, so the closing of stores for diversity training seems likely to become a predictable response when companies fear being perceived as racist. The tactic, which cost Starbucks an <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/starbucks-investors-question-cost-of-bias-training-schultz-says\">estimated $16.7</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-29/starbucks-investors-question-cost-of-bias-training-schultz-says\">m in lost revenue</a>, may alter the narrative \u2013 at least more so than companies such as Macy\u2019s or Barney\u2019s did <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/29/new-york-barneys-macys-racial-profiling-jay-z\">when they admitted no wrongdoing</a> after customers accused them of racial discrimination.</p> <p>But inclusivity training is unlikely to solve persistent discrimination in our society. In some cases, it may even move the needle in the opposite direction: companies with diversity training actually <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/07/why-diversity-programs-fail\">tend to become less diverse over time</a>. Instead of looking to outside consultants and diversity trainers, firms should use their power and expertise to devise strategies not only to reduce retail racism, but to proactively improve the retail experience of non-white people.</p> <p>A first step would be for companies to ban the practices of tailing black customers around stores with clerks or security guards, and of calling the police on black customers because a sales clerk deems them suspicious. But there is far more that Sephora and other companies can do.</p> <p>Sephora is well known in the cosmetic industry as being a pioneer in <a href=\"https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/beauty-in-the-age-of-individualism-sephoras-data-driven-approach/#https://rctom.hbs.org/submission/beauty-in-the-age-of-individualism-sephoras-data-driven-approach/\">analyzing its customers\u2019 data</a> to predict their buying preferences. It also uses a Pantone Color IQ test to find products that match customers\u2019 specific complexions. Why not use such data to improve the experience of customers of all shades and hues? If customers with darker complexions consistently indicate poor in-store experiences, then sales associates could be incentivized to sell to those customer segments to ensure they have satisfactory experiences.</p> <p>LVMH, Sephora\u2019s parent company, owns 75 distinct brands. Imagine what could be learned if they began to ask black customers directly about their experiences, including incidents of discrimination. Promotions or bonuses could be given based on the positive experiences of a diverse range of customers, and inclusive brands could be recognized and given premium shelf space, including black-owned brands like <a href=\"https://www.blackenterprise.com/pat-mcgrath-labs-surpasses-kylie-jenners/\">Pat McGrath Labs</a>.</p> <p>Companies should also encourage customers to report incidents of discrimination, coaching them on how to do so effectively (making sure to include necessary details such as the date and time, sales person\u2019s name, store branch, and so forth). Such data could help companies determine the scale and frequency of discrimination within their organizations and identify specific stores and sales associates that are serial offenders.</p> <p>If companies truly value diversity, it must also show in the racial makeup of their management and executives. Younger generations are becoming <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/11/15/early-benchmarks-show-post-millennials-on-track-to-be-most-diverse-best-educated-generation-yet/\">increasingly racially diverse</a>; the makeup of staff in a position to change company policies and culture should reflect the diversity of these future customers.</p> <p>You can\u2019t train bias away. But by changing the power and incentive structures within companies and proactively improving black consumers\u2019 experiences, companies can create real change in quelling retail racism.</p> <ul> <li><p>Cassi Pittman Claytor is a sociologist whose work examines questions of racial inequality, focusing specially on the experiences of the black middle class and their experiences as consumers</p></li> </ul>",

The tactic, which cost Starbucks an estimated $16.7m in lost revenue, may alter the narrative \u2013 at least more so than companies such as Macy\u2019s or Barney\u2019s did when they admitted no wrongdoing after customers accused them of racial discrimination. But inclusivity training is unlikely to solve persistent discrimination in our society. In some cases, it may even move the needle in the opposite direction: companies with diversity training actually tend to become less diverse over time. Instead of looking to outside consultants and diversity trainers, firms should use their power and expertise to devise strategies not only to reduce retail racism, but to proactively improve the retail experience of non-white people. A first step would be for companies to ban the practices of tailing black customers around stores with clerks or security guards, and of calling the police on black customers because a sales clerk deems them suspicious. But there is far more that Sephora and other companies can do. Sephora is well known in the cosmetic industry as being a pioneer in analyzing its customers\u2019 data to predict their buying preferences. It also uses a Pantone Color IQ test to find products that match customers\u2019 specific complexions. Why not use such data to improve the experience of customers of all shades and hues? If customers with darker complexions consistently indicate poor in-store experiences, then sales associates could be incentivized to sell to those customer segments to ensure they have satisfactory experiences. LVMH, Sephora\u2019s parent company, owns 75 distinct brands. Imagine what could be learned if they began to ask black customers directly about their experiences, including incidents of discrimination. Promotions or bonuses could be given based on the positive experiences of a diverse range of customers, and inclusive brands could be recognized and given premium shelf space, including black-owned brands like Pat McGrath Labs. Companies should also encourage customers to report incidents of discrimination, coaching them on how to do so effectively (making sure to include necessary details such as the date and time, sales person\u2019s name, store branch, and so forth). Such data could help companies determine the scale and frequency of discrimination within their organizations and identify specific stores and sales associates that are serial offenders. If companies truly value diversity, it must also show in the racial makeup of their management and executives. Younger generations are becoming increasingly racially diverse; the makeup of staff in a position to change company policies and culture should reflect the diversity of these future customers. You can\u2019t train bias away. But by changing the power and incentive structures within companies and proactively improving black consumers\u2019 experiences, companies can create real change in quelling retail racism.

      "bodyText": "Carmen was raped by armed guerrilla forces in Colombia. Ekhlas was kidnapped by Isis in Iraq and forced into sexual slavery. Grace was taken by rebels from her classroom in Uganda, \u201cgiven\u201d to a soldier and impregnated twice before finally fleeing to safety. Today, these women are all members of the Global Network of Victims and Survivors to End Wartime Rape, known as Sema, which translates to \u201cspeak out\u201d in Swahili. The network represents roughly 2,000 rape survivors and 90 years\u2019 worth of conflict across 21 countries in Africa, South America, the Middle East and Europe. Although there are no comprehensive statistics on rape as a tool of war, the estimates that do exist reveal a violent, centuries-old trend around the world. An estimated 80,000 women and girls were sexually assaulted in Nanjing in 1937, and more than half a million were raped in Rwanda in the 1990s. More recently, more than 7,000 Yazidi women are believed to have been taken hostage as sex slaves by Isis. Nearly half of them are still captive, according to the NGO We Are Not Weapons of War. Nobel laureate Denis Mukwege, a Congolese gynaecologist who has treated tens of thousands of rape survivors and whose foundation facilitates Sema, said not enough was being done to prevent rape from being used as a weapon of war \u2013 despite international pressure to take action. \u201cAs reports emerged just this week that dozens of civilians have been raped at political protests in Sudan, it is clear that we must do more,\u201d said Mukwege. \u201cFrom Yazidi survivors in the Middle East to those in asylum centres in Europe, survivors lack access to the care they need and deserve. Now is the time to listen to them and to act accordingly. To do this, we must stand with survivors to amplify their voices by sharing their lived realities.\u201d Despite the adoption in April of UN security council resolution 2467, which takes a survivor-centred approach to combat wartime rape and is aimed at strengthening justice and accountability, governments are still failing to act, said Mukwege. \u201c[As] long as there are new victims, this is not enough,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to take more important measures, we need to put an end to impunity, we need put an end to violence and we need to do it now.\u201d To mark last week\u2019s international day to eliminate sexual violence in conflict, some of Sema\u2019s members have spoken out about their own experience of sexual assault and their hopes for the future. Carmen Zape Paja, Colombia Carmen Zape Paja, who is from Colombia\u2019s indigenous Nasa community, was raped by armed guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. ang rape and other forms of sexual violence were regularly used to assert control over communities and instil fear, according to Colombia\u2019s National Centre for Historical Memory, which estimates that 16,000 people fell victim to sexual violence at the hands of rightwing paramilitary groups, security forces and Marxist guerrillas over the 52-year conflict. The perpetrators largely profited from impunity until August 2018, when 2,000 women brought their cases before a peace tribunal despite the fear of retaliation. Today, Carmen works with indigenous communities and people with disabilities and uses educational programmes and traditional tools to combat sexual violence. In 2016, she won a national prize for her work promoting indigenous people\u2019s rights. Indigenous populations across Colombia were targeted during the conflict as a means of asserting control over them, said Carmen: \u201cSexual violence against indigenous women illustrates the power of violence as a weapon of war and terror in armed conflict, and increases racism and stigmatisation against the indigenous population.\u201d Desanges, the Democratic Republic of the Congo Desanges is a survivor of sexual violence from the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a country once described by the UN as \u201cthe rape capital of the world\u201d. Despite supposed peace negotiations, conflict has raged on and off in the country \u2013 particularly in the east \u2013 since 1994, and the number of sexual violence victims has not abated, said Mukwege: \u201cMass rape continues, and the ongoing impunity for perpetrators, coupled with toxic masculinities reinforced by years of war, allow for the violence to persist \u2013 be it executed by civilians, militias or state agents.\u201d International health workers on the ground claim fighting is invariably accompanied by systematic rape: \u201cin villages, at checkpoints on roads, wherever\u201d, one worker told the Guardian last year. Desanges is now an active member of the DRC Survivors\u2019 Movement and recently starred in a film depicting the fight for justice for Congolese rape victims. After attending an April forum on sexual violence that was sponsored by the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg, Desanges wrote a poem about her wishes for the future: \u201cI dream one day I will be the Grand Duchess of the Congo, so I can fight against the impunity that reigns in my country today.\u201d Iryna Dovgan, Ukraine In August 2014, Iryna Dovgan was arrested in Ukraine by pro-Russian military forces, tortured and publicly humiliated. She was tied to a lamppost by pro-Russian separatists, had a sign tied around her neck that read \u201cchild killer\u201d, and was kicked and spat on.

One that occurs more and more within my friendship groups is about communal living in retirement: everyone chipping in to buy a house together, where we can play endless games of Mario Kart, sing D\u2019Angelo round the B\u00f6sendorfer and indulge in vast quantities of mind-bending prescription drugs.

Then of course [therapeutic] services are needed, but they should not be based on an excessive biomedical model.\u201d</p> <p>P\u016bras said there had been an overemphasis on trying to cure mental illness like physical illness, through \u201cgood medicine\u201d, without thinking about the social factors that cause or contribute to some mental disorders.

      "bodyText": "Austerity, inequality and job insecurity are bad for mental health and governments should counteract them if they want to face up to the rising prevalence of mental illness, the UN\u2019s top health envoy has said. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian to coincide with a hard-hitting report to be delivered to the UN in Geneva on Monday, Dr Dainius P\u016bras said measures to address inequality and discrimination would be far more effective in combatting mental illness than the emphasis over the past 30 years on medication and therapy. \u201cThis would be the best \u2018vaccine\u2019 against mental illness and would be much better than the excessive use of psychotropic medication which is happening,\u201d said P\u016bras, who as the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on health reports back to the UN human rights council in Geneva. He said that since the 2008 financial crisis, policies that accentuated division, inequality and social isolation have been bad for mental equilibrium. \u201cAusterity measures did not contribute positively to good mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople feel insecure, they feel anxious, they do not enjoy good emotional wellbeing because of this insecurity situation.\u201d \u201cThe best way to invest in the mental health of individuals is to create a supportive environment in all settings, family, the workplace. Then of course [therapeutic] services are needed, but they should not be based on an excessive biomedical model.\u201d P\u016bras said there had been an overemphasis on trying to cure mental illness like physical illness, through \u201cgood medicine\u201d, without thinking about the social factors that cause or contribute to some mental disorders. The prescription of psychotropic drugs to deal with mental illness, particularly antidepressants, has soared across the developed world in the past 20 years. \u201cPeople go to their doctors who prescribe medication, which is an inadequate response,\u201d he said. If instead governments took issues such as inequality, poverty and discrimination seriously \u201cthen you can expect improving mental health\u201d. Latest World Health Organisation (WHO) figures suggest that as many as 970 million people around the world suffer from some sort of mental distress, and the prevalence of conditions such as depression and anxiety have risen more than 40% over the past 30 years. As acceptance of mental illness has grown, the number of people seeking treatment has grown exponentially, overwhelming services in many countries. The phenomenon has divided experts into those who see mental illness as a predominantly biological, neurological malfunction, treatable by drugs and therapy, and those who believe it is much more psychosocial, the result of government policies, social atomisation, poverty, inequality and insecurity. P\u016bras was careful not to mention the UK by name, because he has not yet visited Britain on his fact-finding mission, but elements of his report will make uncomfortable reading for a UK government which has presided over nearly 10 years of austerity and an increasingly insecure job market shot through with zero-hour contracts and gig economy workers. \u201cInequality is a key obstacle to mental health globally,\u201d his report says. \u201cMany risk factors for poor mental health are closely associated with inequalities in the conditions of daily life. Many risk factors are also linked to the corrosive impact of seeing life as something unfair.\u201d To improve mental health P\u016bras calls, among other things, for reducing inequality and social exclusion, better early-years and school programmes, rapid interventions to support those suffering adverse childhood experiences, stronger workforce unionisation and better social welfare. He also refers critically to \u201cthe outsized influence of pharmaceutical companies in the dissemination of biased information about mental health issues\u201d and says states should counteract this.

      "bodyText": "The furore sparked after police visited the home of Boris Johnson and his partner Carrie Symonds has spilled into a new week, with many national papers leading on calls for the potential prime minister to \u201ccome clean\u201d. The Guardian, the paper which first broke the story, says Johnson must answer questions about the incident, saying such scrutiny \u201cis not only appropriate. It is necessary\u201d. The Express says that senior Conservatives have \u201cpiled pressure on Boris Johnson to come clean about the screaming row\u201d. The i says it is not only Johnson\u2019s opponents, but also his supporters who are demanding \u201ca \u201cfull explanation after Tory frontrunner ducks questions about incident\u201d. The Daily Mail is more sympathetic to the Tory candidate, claiming he and Symonds have been driven out of their home and \u201ccan\u2019t return as flat is targeted by protests\u201d. The Mail says Johnson\u2019s \u201clatest imbroglio\u201d has \u201call the hallmarks of a stitch-up\u201d. But the paper says he \u201ccan\u2019t let it fester\u201d, adding: \u201cThe story is out there and millions are talking about it. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be a soul-baring confessional. Just something to put the episode in its proper context. But until this controversy is settled, he will find it difficult to move on, not least because every interviewer will raise it until the election is over.\u201d The Telegraph is similarly in Johnson\u2019s corner, running a write-off of his weekly column as its lead story: \u201cBoris: I won\u2019t bottle Brexit\u201d. The Times voices sympathy for Johnson, saying such relationship difficulties are \u201cnever easy\u201d and he is \u201cnegotiating his in the public spotlight\u201d. But the paper says it was fair of his rival, Jeremy Hunt, to say that a candidate for prime minister \u201cshould answer questions on everything\u201d. \u201cMr Johnson should acknowledge that a potential prime minister will be scrutinised in personal as well as political life,\u201d the paper continues. \u201cEven so, provided Mr Johnson can answer those questions, Conservative MPs should be sympathetic to an aspirant leader who is mired in domestic turmoil. Break-ups happen. Voters are unlikely to be censorious. Prime ministers need not be perfect; they do need to be assiduous and competent.\u201d The Sun says Johnson should \u201cnip it in the bud\u201d as staying silent benefits those who want to \u201cbring him down\u201d. Its lead story is one from anonymous friends of the couple who say the fight on the weekend was the fourth in six weeks. The Mirror has its own anonymous \u201cpals\u201d and the paper reports they say that \u201cBoris \u2018wants to get back with his wife\u2019\u201d. The FT, the only paper not to splash on Boris Johnson today, leads with: \u201cLloyds froze 8,000 accounts amid offshore dirty-money crackdown\u201d.",

His Tory leadership rival, Jeremy Hunt, says he \u201cneeds to show he can answer difficult questions\u201d. It follows cabinet ministers, backbenchers and major party donors demanding an explanation about the late-night altercation that was heard by several neighbours. Hunt has accused Johnson of appearing willing to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning. \u201cDon\u2019t be a coward Boris, man up,\u201d he wrote in today\u2019s edition of the Times, calling on him to stop avoiding public scrutiny. One Tory donor, who has given more than \u00a3500,000, told the Guardian that the issue was damaging the party. \u201cWe are a laughing stock,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s column in the Daily Telegraph this morning was silent on the incident, with the former foreign secretary preferring to focus on his bid to get the UK out of Europe by Halloween.

Her parents took her to an airport near where they lived in New Mexico and she got up close to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_DC-3\" title=\"\">Douglas DC-3</a>, an early airliner. \u201cI go right to the wheel and I try to turn the nut,\u201d she says. \u201cMother said: \u2018She\u2019s going to fly.\u2019\u201d Just over 20 years later, in 1961, Funk\u2019s mother dropped her off at a clinic in Albuquerque, where she became the youngest participant in a programme to test whether the US\u2019s best female pilots could become astronauts. She didn\u2019t make it into space, but, nearly six decades on, she is still trying.</p> <p>We meet at the home of Funk\u2019s friend, the journalist Sue Nelson, who has written a wonderful book about her. Funk is 80, straight-backed and sparkling. She is dressed in a black shirt embroidered with \u201cWally\u201d on one side and the logo from the organisation <a href=\"https://www.wai.org/\" title=\"\">Women in Aviation International</a> on the other, neatly tucked into black trousers on which she has sewn a patch for SpaceShipTwo \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/13/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-launch-california-edge-of-space\" title=\"\">Virgin Galactic\u2019s suborbital plane</a>. Funk spent $200,000 on a ticket in 2010 and is still waiting for the opportunity to use it.

She grew up in Taos, a town in New Mexico, where her parents ran a chain of shops and let her run wild. She grew up riding her bike or her horse, skiing, hunting and fishing. When she was 14, the National Rifle Association sent her incredible shooting results to the president, Dwight Eisenhower, and he wrote back to her. \u201cI did everything that people didn\u2019t expect a girl to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was nothing I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d She was expected to be home, washed and wearing a dress every evening for dinner, but other than that they encouraged her outdoors nature. When she wanted to build a treehouse, her father got her the tools. \u201cToday\u2019s kids wouldn\u2019t know what to think of it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Funk didn\u2019t give the idea of space much thought, but she wanted to fly. By the time she was seven, she was making planes from balsa wood. At nine, she had her first flying lesson. She remembers \u201cthe air and how pretty it was, and how the ground looked. It was probably all of 15 minutes.\u201d</p> <p>She didn\u2019t fly again until her teens, when she enrolled at Stephens College in Missouri and got her flying licence. She went on to study education at Oklahoma State University, mainly because it had an aviation team known as <a href=\"https://www.flyingaggies.com/\" title=\"\">the Flying Aggies</a>. \u201cAs a Flying Aggie, I could do all the manoeuvres as well as the boys, if not better,\u201d she says. After that, she became a flight instructor \u2013 the only female one \u2013 at a US military base.</p> <p>Then Funk read an article about <a href=\"https://www.history.nasa.gov/flats.html\" title=\"\">the Woman in Space Program</a>, run by William Randolph Lovelace. A doctor who had worked on Project Mercury, Nasa\u2019s drive to put a man into orbit around the Earth, Lovelace launched this privately funded programme to discover if women were as able as men. Funk contacted him, detailing her experience and achievements. Despite being underage \u2013 the women were supposed to be between 25 and 40; she was 22 \u2013 she was invited to take part.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29ca458a4aed3b7b55c46547c961829dcb2d51c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29ca458a4aed3b7b55c46547c961829dcb2d51c5/0_0_2233_1768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Funk and two other members of the Flying Aggies with the silverware they won, circa 1959\" width=\"1000\" height=\"792\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I could do all the manoeuvres as well as the boys, if not better\u2019 ...

      "bodyText": "When Wally Funk was barely a year old, she discovered aeroplanes. Her parents took her to an airport near where they lived in New Mexico and she got up close to a Douglas DC-3, an early airliner. \u201cI go right to the wheel and I try to turn the nut,\u201d she says. \u201cMother said: \u2018She\u2019s going to fly.\u2019\u201d Just over 20 years later, in 1961, Funk\u2019s mother dropped her off at a clinic in Albuquerque, where she became the youngest participant in a programme to test whether the US\u2019s best female pilots could become astronauts. She didn\u2019t make it into space, but, nearly six decades on, she is still trying. We meet at the home of Funk\u2019s friend, the journalist Sue Nelson, who has written a wonderful book about her. Funk is 80, straight-backed and sparkling. She is dressed in a black shirt embroidered with \u201cWally\u201d on one side and the logo from the organisation Women in Aviation International on the other, neatly tucked into black trousers on which she has sewn a patch for SpaceShipTwo \u2013 Virgin Galactic\u2019s suborbital plane. Funk spent $200,000 on a ticket in 2010 and is still waiting for the opportunity to use it. She talks energetically and loudly, and you have to speak up if you want her to hear you, thanks to a lifetime spent near plane engines. She is unlike anyone I have ever met. \u201cOK, lay it on me,\u201d she says, fixing me with a direct look. Mary Wallace Funk was born in 1939. She grew up in Taos, a town in New Mexico, where her parents ran a chain of shops and let her run wild. She grew up riding her bike or her horse, skiing, hunting and fishing. When she was 14, the National Rifle Association sent her incredible shooting results to the president, Dwight Eisenhower, and he wrote back to her. \u201cI did everything that people didn\u2019t expect a girl to do,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was nothing I couldn\u2019t do.\u201d She was expected to be home, washed and wearing a dress every evening for dinner, but other than that they encouraged her outdoors nature. When she wanted to build a treehouse, her father got her the tools. \u201cToday\u2019s kids wouldn\u2019t know what to think of it,\u201d she says. Funk didn\u2019t give the idea of space much thought, but she wanted to fly. By the time she was seven, she was making planes from balsa wood. At nine, she had her first flying lesson. She remembers \u201cthe air and how pretty it was, and how the ground looked. It was probably all of 15 minutes.\u201d She didn\u2019t fly again until her teens, when she enrolled at Stephens College in Missouri and got her flying licence. She went on to study education at Oklahoma State University, mainly because it had an aviation team known as the Flying Aggies. \u201cAs a Flying Aggie, I could do all the manoeuvres as well as the boys, if not better,\u201d she says. After that, she became a flight instructor \u2013 the only female one \u2013 at a US military base. Then Funk read an article about the Woman in Space Program, run by William Randolph Lovelace. A doctor who had worked on Project Mercury, Nasa\u2019s drive to put a man into orbit around the Earth, Lovelace launched this privately funded programme to discover if women were as able as men. Funk contacted him, detailing her experience and achievements. Despite being underage \u2013 the women were supposed to be between 25 and 40; she was 22 \u2013 she was invited to take part. \u201cThe first day, they said: \u2018Come in, don\u2019t drink, don\u2019t eat,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThe first thing they do is temperature, take all the blood tests they can, and then I was put in a chair, strapped in, and they inject [ice-cold] water into my ear.\u201d The test, which was intended to induce vertigo so that the scientists could record how the participants dealt with it, was painful, but Funk says she was taught never to give in to discomfort. The other woman being tested that day dropped out within hours, so Funk spent the rest of the week on her own. \u201cI took it. I can take anything.

For what reason, I have no idea.\u201d One of the tests involved floating in the dark in a sensory-deprivation tank. \u201cI turned my brain off and I went up into the heavens,\u201d she says. \u201cI lay there and lay there. Pretty soon \u2013 many hours later, although I had no knowledge of time \u2013 a voice came over and said: \u2018Wally, do you need to go to the bathroom?\u2019 and I said: \u2018I\u2019ve already done that.\u2019\u201d She laughs. \u201cThey said: \u2018OK, how do you feel?\u2019 I said: \u2018I feel great!\u2019 Then silence. And that\u2019s the way I sleep today.\u201d She spread-eagles her arms and legs and says: \u201cYou will sleep better.\u201d When she came out, she was told she had been in there for 10 hours and 35 minutes and broken the record. \u201cI said: \u2018Good.

Ilana of Broad City<em> </em>has exposed her underarm growth; so have <a href=\"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/beauty-hair/celebrity-hair-makeup/news/a36214/jemima-kirke-hairy-armpits-criticism/\">Jemima Kirke</a> and <a href=\"https://www.racked.com/2018/5/21/17376580/deadpool-2-domino-zazie-beetz-armpit-hair\">Zazie Beetz</a>. In January of this year, Laura Jackson, a British college student, ran a campaign called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/januhairy/?hl=en\">Januhairy</a>,\u201d urging women to grow out their body hair and post selfies on Instagram.</p> <p>In some ways, this phenomenon harks back to the second wave movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when feminists began to challenge restrictive beauty standards. At a famous march outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, protesters ceremoniously discarded their bras and stiletto heels; many feminists of that era also ditched their razors and tweezers. But today\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist.</p> <p>Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty \u2013they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie \u2013 while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to <em>curate</em> different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94c36485583a376ffe837b07ff8f88a87a830bfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94c36485583a376ffe837b07ff8f88a87a830bfe/0_0_1798_1224/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Billie brands itself as \u2018selling razors for womankind.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"681\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Billie brands itself as \u2018selling razors for womankind\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Billie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Enter Billie, a New York-based subscription service that sells \u201crazors built for womankind\u201d. In January, the company announced a $25m investment from Goldman Sachs and other backers.</p> <p>Since its launch in November 2017, Billie has positioned itself as explicitly feminist. It denounces the so-called \u201cpink tax\u201d (the documented premium women pay for personal care products) and offers a \u201cpink tax rebate\u201d (a coupon toward a purchase). The company also says it donates 1% of all revenue to \u201cwomen\u2019s causes around the world\u201d, including <a href=\"https://everymothercounts.org\">Every Mother Counts</a>, a not-for-profit dedicated to global maternal health.</p> <p>Billie\u2019s most radical feminist move is to show, in its various promotional materials, women removing actual hair from their bodies: models dragging razors up <a href=\"https://mybillie.com\">shaggy, moistened legs</a>. As the company\u2019s web copy notes, \u201cCommercials show women \u2018shaving\u2019 perfectly smooth, airbrushed legs. Strange, huh?\u201d In a move that is either generously self-undermining or shrewdly opportunistic (or both), Billie also runs <a href=\"https://mybillie.com/pages/projectbodyhair\">Project Body Hair</a>, an image library of hair in all sorts of places it\u2019s not supposed to be.</p> <p>One of Billie\u2019s models is Hale, a 19-year-old musician and student at Bard College. On Billie\u2019s website, Hale sits on the floor against a bed, wearing a frilled white tank top. She is smoothing the hair on her head back with arms raised, revealing undisturbed axillary fuzz.</p> <p>Hale hit puberty early, she told me, and her body hair was dark and noticeable. At one point, \u201cI shaved literally everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI shaved my whole stomach when I was in elementary school, because I didn\u2019t like my happy trail.\u201d<strong> </strong>But in high school, she began to question the hairlessness ideal, and realized that \u201chaving autonomy over my body didn\u2019t make me less attractive or less valuable\u201d. Now, she sometimes, but not always, removes hair from her legs and other body parts, but never from her armpits. Until recently she waxed her unibrow, but as it grows back, she\u2019s started to think it\u2019s \u201creally cute\u201d.</p> <p>Billie\u2019s branding strategy may come across as fishy \u2013 they do sell razors, after all. But it seems to fit right in with the emerging ethos around body hair: celebrating women\u2019s choices as a hodgepodge of individual decisions about how to adhere to or violate cultural norms.</p> <p>As Georgina Gooley, Billie\u2019s 33-year-old Australian-born co-founder, told me, \u201cIf you choose to shave, we have a great product for you. If you don\u2019t, we have other products as well.\u201d (The company also sells lotion and body wash.) With Project Body Hair, she says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t sending the message that shaving is an expectation. We were saying shaving is a choice.\u201d</p> <h2>Two camps</h2> <p>Back in the 1970s, the conversation sounded quite different. As Rebecca Herzig writes in her 2015 book Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, two camps emerged in the second wave movement.</p> <p>The very first full issue of Ms. Magazine, in July of 1972, featured an article titled Body Hair: The Last Frontier. It criticized the shaving norm as an \u201cembodiment of our culture\u2019s preoccupation with keeping women in a kind of state of innocence, and denying their visceral selves\u201d. The time, money and psychological energy required for depilation were oppressive. Hairlessness was also infantilizing \u2013 it made women look like prepubescent girls. The social norm suggested, not very subtly, that there was something inherently wrong, gross and dirty about women\u2019s bodies as they naturally were.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8612b315f44c23271622e4e58e7eabc06b8e4f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b8612b315f44c23271622e4e58e7eabc06b8e4f1/0_0_1000_1200/833.jpg\" alt=\"A razor from Billie.\" width=\"833\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A razor from Billie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Billie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But another faction of feminists, led by Betty Friedan, had a different take. Friedan believed the preoccupation with body hair was counterproductive. She considered these concerns a trivial distraction from more important issues, such as professional opportunities and subsidized childcare. She also thought they harmed the cause of feminism by casting feminists as hairy, ugly, man-hating weirdos.</p> <p>I came of age in the 1990s, a midway point of sorts. My two best friends and I stopped shaving in high school. For me, this decision was not explicitly about feminism, but about an allegiance to my idea of authenticity (not to mention my allegiance to laziness). It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t care how I looked; I wanted to look like I didn\u2019t care how I looked. I wanted to <em>be </em>attractive, but I did not want to invest effort or enlist artifice into making myself so. Any such measures, to my 16-year-old mind, would have been cheating.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/apr/29/female-armpit-hair-outrage-disgust-nike-ad\">Why does female armpit hair provoke such outrage and disgust?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At the same time, I usually felt self-conscious about my body hair, and often wore pants or long skirts. Displaying smooth, bald legs would have felt like selling out, but I felt a different sort of discomfort displaying hairy ones. I envied one of my friends whose leg hair was fine and wispy. Mine was not. (Later I resumed shaving my legs.)</p> <p>Back then, in my recollection, body hair did not register much in the cultural conversation. The founders of Instagram were in middle school. Feminism was in something of a lull, with a few exceptions such as the Riot Grrrl scene. My favorite magazine, Sassy, did embrace feminism, but not in a way that involved challenging beauty norms very aggressively. As far as I recall, nary a patch of stubble could be found on the waifish bodies of their models.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to say exactly when what Hale refers to as the new \u201cbody-hair movement\u201d emerged \u2013 she describes it as \u201cnon-boys taking up space and deciding that they\u2019re not going to adjust to the norms\u201d.</p> <p>But she remembers thinking something was afoot when dyed armpit hair became fashionable a few years ago. One of the pioneers of that micro-trend was <a href=\"https://roxiejanehunt.com/2014/10/pit-color-diy/\">Roxie Jane Hunt</a>, a hairstylist in Seattle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/v3uBeimUar/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

It felt like a big chore but also a little bit of violence against my own body.\u201d When her daughter was about two, she saw Hunt shaving and asked her why. \u201cI realized I didn\u2019t have a good enough answer,\u201d Hunt says. She grew out her armpit hair, and found it \u201cmuch more sexy and natural\u201d.</p> <p>In 2014, on a lark, she and a friend dyed their underarm hair \u201cethereal blue\u201d, and Hunt posted photos of the colorful pits on her blog. \u201cThe blogpost kind of went viral from there,\u201d she says. She described the attitude with which they approached the exercise as \u201csort of joy. It opened up a little more imagination.\u201d Many people have since posted pictures of their \u201cunicorn pits\u201d, dyed in all the colors of the rainbow.</p> <p>If body hair has historically been invisible \u2013 too shameful to even show in razor commercials \u2013 this aesthetic makes it ultra-visible. In that sense, it takes the pro-hair ethos to its extreme. But in another sense, this practice is the opposite of the \u201clet it all hang out\u201d approach: it is, after all, hard to think of a grooming choice less natural, less laissez-faire, than polychromatic armpit hair.</p> <p>The look is also highly social-mediagenic, destined for virality. And social media, for both dyed and virgin body hair, is obviously a key part of what makes this round of hair affirmation different from previous eras. Women are not only refusing to conceal their body hair; they\u2019re flaunting it.</p> <h2>Reluctance to judge</h2> <p>A long-running debate within feminism has been whether we should respect women\u2019s choices \u2013 even if they seem to result from oppression \u2013 or whether only certain \u201cliberated\u201d choices merit approval. The new body-hair acceptance advocates land squarely in the former territory. When I was growing up, a common catchphrase was \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but \u2026\u201d followed by some statement of support for feminist principles, such as equal pay.

      "bodyText": "I am usually late to catch on to shifts in the zeitgeist; this one came to my attention just recently. While watching the HBO show High Maintenance, I noticed that Lee, the protagonist\u2019s hip and beautiful love interest, was sporting hairy armpits. \u201cLook!\u201d I cried to my husband, as though I\u2019d unexpectedly spotted a T-shirt emblazoned with the name of my favorite obscure band. For the past couple of decades, I have seldom shaved my armpits. Now, all of a sudden, I was on-trend. Among both celebrities and the masses, female body hair is sprouting all over. Ilana of Broad City has exposed her underarm growth; so have Jemima Kirke and Zazie Beetz. In January of this year, Laura Jackson, a British college student, ran a campaign called \u201cJanuhairy,\u201d urging women to grow out their body hair and post selfies on Instagram. In some ways, this phenomenon harks back to the second wave movement of the 1960s and 1970s, when feminists began to challenge restrictive beauty standards. At a famous march outside the 1968 Miss America pageant in Atlantic City, protesters ceremoniously discarded their bras and stiletto heels; many feminists of that era also ditched their razors and tweezers. But today\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for female hirsuteness comes with a distinctly 21st-century twist. Unshaven women in 2019 often meet other criteria for traditional feminine beauty \u2013they have sculpted eyebrows, wear lipstick or sexy lingerie \u2013 while proudly displaying their armpit hair. If the ethos of the 70s was a refusal to spend time and effort on cosmetics, the more common approach today is for women to curate different elements of their appearance, remaining conventionally attractive while deploying body hair as a feminist fuck-you: half-statement, half-ornament. Enter Billie, a New York-based subscription service that sells \u201crazors built for womankind\u201d. In January, the company announced a $25m investment from Goldman Sachs and other backers. Since its launch in November 2017, Billie has positioned itself as explicitly feminist. It denounces the so-called \u201cpink tax\u201d (the documented premium women pay for personal care products) and offers a \u201cpink tax rebate\u201d (a coupon toward a purchase). The company also says it donates 1% of all revenue to \u201cwomen\u2019s causes around the world\u201d, including Every Mother Counts, a not-for-profit dedicated to global maternal health. Billie\u2019s most radical feminist move is to show, in its various promotional materials, women removing actual hair from their bodies: models dragging razors up shaggy, moistened legs. As the company\u2019s web copy notes, \u201cCommercials show women \u2018shaving\u2019 perfectly smooth, airbrushed legs. Strange, huh?\u201d In a move that is either generously self-undermining or shrewdly opportunistic (or both), Billie also runs Project Body Hair, an image library of hair in all sorts of places it\u2019s not supposed to be. One of Billie\u2019s models is Hale, a 19-year-old musician and student at Bard College. On Billie\u2019s website, Hale sits on the floor against a bed, wearing a frilled white tank top. She is smoothing the hair on her head back with arms raised, revealing undisturbed axillary fuzz. Hale hit puberty early, she told me, and her body hair was dark and noticeable. At one point, \u201cI shaved literally everything,\u201d she said. \u201cI shaved my whole stomach when I was in elementary school, because I didn\u2019t like my happy trail.\u201d But in high school, she began to question the hairlessness ideal, and realized that \u201chaving autonomy over my body didn\u2019t make me less attractive or less valuable\u201d. Now, she sometimes, but not always, removes hair from her legs and other body parts, but never from her armpits. Until recently she waxed her unibrow, but as it grows back, she\u2019s started to think it\u2019s \u201creally cute\u201d. Billie\u2019s branding strategy may come across as fishy \u2013 they do sell razors, after all. But it seems to fit right in with the emerging ethos around body hair: celebrating women\u2019s choices as a hodgepodge of individual decisions about how to adhere to or violate cultural norms. As Georgina Gooley, Billie\u2019s 33-year-old Australian-born co-founder, told me, \u201cIf you choose to shave, we have a great product for you. If you don\u2019t, we have other products as well.\u201d (The company also sells lotion and body wash.) With Project Body Hair, she says, \u201cWe weren\u2019t sending the message that shaving is an expectation. We were saying shaving is a choice.\u201d Two camps Back in the 1970s, the conversation sounded quite different. As Rebecca Herzig writes in her 2015 book Plucked: A History of Hair Removal, two camps emerged in the second wave movement. The very first full issue of Ms. Magazine, in July of 1972, featured an article titled Body Hair: The Last Frontier. It criticized the shaving norm as an \u201cembodiment of our culture\u2019s preoccupation with keeping women in a kind of state of innocence, and denying their visceral selves\u201d. The time, money and psychological energy required for depilation were oppressive. Hairlessness was also infantilizing \u2013 it made women look like prepubescent girls. The social norm suggested, not very subtly, that there was something inherently wrong, gross and dirty about women\u2019s bodies as they naturally were. But another faction of feminists, led by Betty Friedan, had a different take. Friedan believed the preoccupation with body hair was counterproductive. She considered these concerns a trivial distraction from more important issues, such as professional opportunities and subsidized childcare. She also thought they harmed the cause of feminism by casting feminists as hairy, ugly, man-hating weirdos. I came of age in the 1990s, a midway point of sorts. My two best friends and I stopped shaving in high school. For me, this decision was not explicitly about feminism, but about an allegiance to my idea of authenticity (not to mention my allegiance to laziness). It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t care how I looked; I wanted to look like I didn\u2019t care how I looked. I wanted to be attractive, but I did not want to invest effort or enlist artifice into making myself so. Any such measures, to my 16-year-old mind, would have been cheating. At the same time, I usually felt self-conscious about my body hair, and often wore pants or long skirts. Displaying smooth, bald legs would have felt like selling out, but I felt a different sort of discomfort displaying hairy ones. I envied one of my friends whose leg hair was fine and wispy. Mine was not. (Later I resumed shaving my legs.) Back then, in my recollection, body hair did not register much in the cultural conversation. The founders of Instagram were in middle school. Feminism was in something of a lull, with a few exceptions such as the Riot Grrrl scene. My favorite magazine, Sassy, did embrace feminism, but not in a way that involved challenging beauty norms very aggressively. As far as I recall, nary a patch of stubble could be found on the waifish bodies of their models. It\u2019s hard to say exactly when what Hale refers to as the new \u201cbody-hair movement\u201d emerged \u2013 she describes it as \u201cnon-boys taking up space and deciding that they\u2019re not going to adjust to the norms\u201d. But she remembers thinking something was afoot when dyed armpit hair became fashionable a few years ago. One of the pioneers of that micro-trend was Roxie Jane Hunt, a hairstylist in Seattle. Hunt, 35, shaved as a teenager, but, she says, \u201cI always hated the action of doing it. It felt like a big chore but also a little bit of violence against my own body.\u201d When her daughter was about two, she saw Hunt shaving and asked her why. \u201cI realized I didn\u2019t have a good enough answer,\u201d Hunt says. She grew out her armpit hair, and found it \u201cmuch more sexy and natural\u201d. In 2014, on a lark, she and a friend dyed their underarm hair \u201cethereal blue\u201d, and Hunt posted photos of the colorful pits on her blog. \u201cThe blogpost kind of went viral from there,\u201d she says. She described the attitude with which they approached the exercise as \u201csort of joy. It opened up a little more imagination.\u201d Many people have since posted pictures of their \u201cunicorn pits\u201d, dyed in all the colors of the rainbow. If body hair has historically been invisible \u2013 too shameful to even show in razor commercials \u2013 this aesthetic makes it ultra-visible. In that sense, it takes the pro-hair ethos to its extreme. But in another sense, this practice is the opposite of the \u201clet it all hang out\u201d approach: it is, after all, hard to think of a grooming choice less natural, less laissez-faire, than polychromatic armpit hair. The look is also highly social-mediagenic, destined for virality. And social media, for both dyed and virgin body hair, is obviously a key part of what makes this round of hair affirmation different from previous eras. Women are not only refusing to conceal their body hair; they\u2019re flaunting it. Reluctance to judge A long-running debate within feminism has been whether we should respect women\u2019s choices \u2013 even if they seem to result from oppression \u2013 or whether only certain \u201cliberated\u201d choices merit approval. The new body-hair acceptance advocates land squarely in the former territory. When I was growing up, a common catchphrase was \u201cI\u2019m not a feminist, but \u2026\u201d followed by some statement of support for feminist principles, such as equal pay. Now, much more common is something like the reverse: claiming the mantle of feminism no matter how un-feminist the position may seem. A theme that came through loudly in my conversations with young women was that we should judge nothing \u2013 except perhaps judgment itself. \u201cI think the 70s wave of feminism was outright rejecting femininity. We don\u2019t need makeup, we don\u2019t want to be housewives,\u201d said Ashley Armitage, a 25-year-old photographer who shot one of the Billie marketing campaigns. \u201cNow it\u2019s like, wait a second, you can be a feminist and a housewife. You can shave.\u201d Surveying this new world of body hair, I wondered: are women making these choices because they think body hair is feminine, or despite the fact that they don\u2019t think it\u2019s feminine? Is there ever tension between their aesthetic preferences and their values? Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the prevalent reluctance to judge, no one wanted to say that they didn\u2019t like any particular aesthetic choice. According to Gooley, the Billie co-founder, she found a range of attitudes in her focus groups and market research. Some women think \u201cit\u2019s a patriarchal view to force women to shave. Other women are like, \u2018I just think it\u2019s really cute. I like my underarm hair.\u2019\u201d Just as there\u2019s a mix of motives, there\u2019s also a series of decisions \u2013 not a one-time resolution to always shave everything or never shave anything. \u201cSo many people, maybe sometimes they\u2019ll shave, sometimes they\u2019ll grow their hair out,\u201d says Armitage. \u201cSometimes they\u2019ll shave their legs, sometimes they\u2019ll grow their armpit hair.\u201d Considering this reality, Billie\u2019s pitch starts to make a little more sense. So far, this is all sounding very kumbaya: the shaven and the waxed and the hairy and the semi-hairy all getting along famously, showering each other with love and likes in a judgment-free festival. There is some truth to that: this discourse is refreshingly peaceable. But of course, it\u2019s not all rainbows and unicorns.

But Libra is a project conceived and developed by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company. And the currency will only perform the necessary feat of scaling up if it becomes a central part of the lives of the billions of us who use Facebook\u2019s platforms, via a linked app called Calibra that will initially be woven into Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Facebook will know the people and companies with whom its users have financially interacted, and that is likely to only be the start</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Naturally enough, the idea is presented not in terms of profit maximisation, but the philanthropic feelgoodery that seems to make northern Californians billionaires as a matter of accident. One element of the initiative is making <a href=\"https://libra.org/en-US/white-paper/\" title=\"\">person-to-person transactions</a> possible at either low or no cost \u2013 so that the migrant worker, say, can wire money home to their family and be assured that no one will be taking a cut. Moreover, thanks to the ease of wage and bill payments, people so far left out of financial services can cease to be \u201cunbanked\u201d, and thereby gain more personal freedom. This is hardly a new idea, but, as with most Facebook initiatives, it\u2019s superficially a very good one.</p> \n<p>But, capitalism being capitalism, there are likely to be more venal motivations at work. There are vast markets in the developing world where Facebook and its subsidiaries have millions of users but are held back from creaming off advertising revenue by the simple matter of poverty. Libra offers new revenue opportunities, partly by inviting people to exchange national currencies for the new medium, thereby gifting Facebook and its partners a vast pool of funds. In these territories, and more affluent places, the new currency also offers Facebook the chance to accelerate what sits at the heart of everything it does: the harvesting of endless data, which can then be monetised.</p> \n<p>Facebook is at pains to address such anxieties, but its initial outline of how the new currency will be used in Messenger and WhatsApp via Calibra is not exactly reassuring. At the very least, Facebook will know the people and companies with whom its users have financially interacted, but that is likely to only be the start. \u201cCalibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party <em>without customer consent</em>,\u201d <a href=\"https://scontent-lhr3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/65083631_355528488499253_8415273665234468864_n.pdf?_nc_cat=106&amp;_nc_ht=scontent-lhr3-1.xx&amp;oh=45208d1958bce06d04117f1953ab5b77&amp;oe=5D982AC3\" title=\"\">it says</a> (my italics). Obviously, the company has past form here: the kind of forced consent that means you either allow Facebook to gobble up your data or don\u2019t get access to many of its services. Whatever the guarantees, the most basic point is obvious enough: why should a company with such an appalling record on personal data be trusted to so massively extend its reach?</p> \n<p>Other questions abound. What will happen if Libra sucks national currencies out of already vulnerable economies? What will be its relationship to inflation? What of the dangers of international money laundering? Why are Facebook high-ups already talking about Libra extending into credit?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"eb902a54-7c8f-4d35-a3e0-2d35ce2cd790\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Libra?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Facebook says Libra is a 'global currency and financial infrastructure' - a digital asset built by Facebook and powered by a new Facebook-created version of blockchain, the encrypted technology used by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The currency will be serviced by a collective of companies called the 'Libra Association'. It functions as what is known as a 'stablecoin', pegged to existing assets like the dollar or euro, in the aim of making it less subject to the volatility that many cryptocurrencies experience.</p>\n    <p>The Libra Association is described by Facebook as an independent, not-for-profit organisation based in Switzerland.

The companies who contributed a minimum of $10m(\u00a38m) to be listed as founding members of the Libra Association include tech companies such as PayPal, Ebay, Spotify, Uber and Lyft, as well as financial and venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Thrive Capital, Visa and Mastercard.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>However in October 2019 several of the companies that had been backing the initiative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/11/payment-firms-back-out-in-painful-blow-to-facebooks-cryptocurrency-libra\">announced that they were pulling out</a>, including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Stripe.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How and when can I use it?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>With regulators asking questions and backing companies dropping out, it is unclear now if Libra is still viable.

      "bodyText": "Dystopian fiction \u2013 from Anthony Burgess\u2019s A Clockwork Orange to Russell T Davies\u2019s spectacular recent BBC1 series Years and Years \u2013 is usually intended to take elements of the present and then imagine a future in which they have become inescapable, so as to warn us of what might already be in our midst. But the 21st century is challenging this technique in one bracing sense: the way the world now seems to race beyond the wildest aspects of our collective imagination before we have even started to think about what might come next. Consider last week\u2019s news about Facebook, and the fact that three years of corporate disgrace \u2013 and rising noise from legislators about bringing the tech giant to heel \u2013 have yet to slow its terrifying quest to insinuate its workings into every area of our lives. Now, in a move that could have been taken from a futuristic novel, it wants to create nothing less than a new global currency. \u201cLibra\u201d will be pegged to a basket of mainstream currencies at a value of about a dollar, and rooted in the model of secure, immutable online transactions we know as blockchain. Its operations will be overseen by a new organisation based in Geneva, open to any company or corporation that has a value of at least $1bn (\u00a3790m) and will invest a minimum of $10m. There are currently 28 such participants, ranging from Uber and Spotify to Mastercard \u2013 and by way of assuring sceptics of its supposedly hands-off intentions, Facebook insists its own voting power will be restricted to 1%. But Libra is a project conceived and developed by Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s company. And the currency will only perform the necessary feat of scaling up if it becomes a central part of the lives of the billions of us who use Facebook\u2019s platforms, via a linked app called Calibra that will initially be woven into Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp. Naturally enough, the idea is presented not in terms of profit maximisation, but the philanthropic feelgoodery that seems to make northern Californians billionaires as a matter of accident. One element of the initiative is making person-to-person transactions possible at either low or no cost \u2013 so that the migrant worker, say, can wire money home to their family and be assured that no one will be taking a cut. Moreover, thanks to the ease of wage and bill payments, people so far left out of financial services can cease to be \u201cunbanked\u201d, and thereby gain more personal freedom. This is hardly a new idea, but, as with most Facebook initiatives, it\u2019s superficially a very good one. But, capitalism being capitalism, there are likely to be more venal motivations at work. There are vast markets in the developing world where Facebook and its subsidiaries have millions of users but are held back from creaming off advertising revenue by the simple matter of poverty. Libra offers new revenue opportunities, partly by inviting people to exchange national currencies for the new medium, thereby gifting Facebook and its partners a vast pool of funds. In these territories, and more affluent places, the new currency also offers Facebook the chance to accelerate what sits at the heart of everything it does: the harvesting of endless data, which can then be monetised. Facebook is at pains to address such anxieties, but its initial outline of how the new currency will be used in Messenger and WhatsApp via Calibra is not exactly reassuring. At the very least, Facebook will know the people and companies with whom its users have financially interacted, but that is likely to only be the start. \u201cCalibra will not share account information or financial data with Facebook, Inc or any third party without customer consent,\u201d it says (my italics). Obviously, the company has past form here: the kind of forced consent that means you either allow Facebook to gobble up your data or don\u2019t get access to many of its services. Whatever the guarantees, the most basic point is obvious enough: why should a company with such an appalling record on personal data be trusted to so massively extend its reach? Other questions abound. What will happen if Libra sucks national currencies out of already vulnerable economies? What will be its relationship to inflation? What of the dangers of international money laundering? Why are Facebook high-ups already talking about Libra extending into credit? Such concerns were highlighted last week by indications that India\u2019s institutional hostility to cryptocurrencies means Libra will not be launched there, for the time being at least. But every bit as alarming is how the entry of Facebook into the creation of money will lead it to another sphere currently overseen by the state: beyond everyday consumerism, into the nitty-gritty of how we use public services and interact with government \u2013 in education, health, social care, crime and punishment, and everything else. Google has already got there, as proved by everything from its vast presence in the US education system to the use of NHS data by its artificial intelligence wing, DeepMind. But think about everyday payments: come 2050, across the planet, what currencies do we think will be used for taxes, benefits, fines, bail, student loan repayments and all the rest \u2013 and what will happen to the huge data trails such things create? In China, those on the all-encompassing social network WeChat \u2013 which Zuckerberg clearly wants to emulate \u2013 can use it to pay taxes and fines. Even in fusty old Britain, the Cabinet Office has already considered using Facebook logins as a means for people to access social security benefits, make council tax payments and get a driver\u2019s licence. Why would it not then think about what we may yet know as Librafication?

It would amass mountains of lucrative information about everything from our friends to when we last paid a speeding fine \u2013 and in the process, bring unlimited corporate power into areas we still consider subject to the checks and balances of democracy.

So if they want to reconcile the different groups, the Greens have to focus on social issues as well, such as how to pay, and who will pay, for the transition from dirty to clean energy; from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric vehicles. Will it be chiefly the people in areas that today depend on coal plants and mines, or the owners of diesel cars? When Emmanuel Macron in France proclaimed a tax on fuel he faced a nationwide movement of gilets jaunes. His experience shows that green and social questions have to be looked at together. So the Greens have to focus harder on social politics. A few weeks ago they presented their model of a basic income for all families with children. To achieve this they would have to form an alliance with the Social Democrats and the leftwing Die Linke. The Greens feel strong enough to ignore their approaches at the moment and leave all options open. That won\u2019t work in the long run. If the Greens fail to reconcile social and environmental matters, they risk being seen as part of a complacent elite, and will be fought by those who don\u2019t feel represented. A fight like this, that leaves the political system as well as society wrecked, can be seen in Britain. Beware. \u2022 Anna Lehmann is an editor on the Berlin-based daily newspaper Die Tageszeitung",

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Morgan and Hands say in the foreword to the report that the interim recommendations reflect the commission\u2019s commitment to find solutions \u201ccompatible with any of the potential Brexit outcomes\u201d including the current withdrawal agreement.</p> \n<p>The report found that any alternative arrangements must recognise \u201cthe supremacy of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement\u201d (GFA) and the preservation of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/travelling-in-the-common-travel-area-if-theres-no-brexit-deal/travelling-within-the-common-travel-area-and-the-associated-rights-of-british-and-irish-citizens-if-there-is-no-brexit-deal\">the common travel area</a>.</p> \n<p>They should also recognise the need for a trade policy in the UK that is independent of the EU, and the need to ensure east-west trade flows as easily as possible.</p> \n<p>The report also states that all future proposals \u201cmust be based on consent\u201d, one of the central tenets of the GFA and a recognition of the two heritages in Northern Ireland.

      "bodyText": "Alternative arrangements for keeping the Irish border open in the event of a no-deal Brexit or the collapse of future trade talks with the EU could be up and running within three years, a report concludes. The interim report by a non-government organisation calling itself the Alternative Arrangements Commission will be unveiled at a special conference on the Irish border in London on Monday. Their conclusions suggest that the UK would only need the Irish border backstop contained in the withdrawal agreement until 2022, if work on such arrangements started today. Backed by remain-voting Conservative party MPs Nicky Morgan and Greg Hands, the report makes eight interim recommendations following consultation with business, politicians and economic experts, including commercial interests in Northern Ireland. It suggests special economic zones \u201ccovering frontier traffic and national security offer potentially valuable solutions\u201d which it said would respect the realities of the border. The report addresses key issues including the vexed question of health checks on any live animals, animal or plant produce crossing the border, including milk, pigs and sheep. The report says \u201csanitary and phytosanitary (SPS)\u201d tests could be carried out by mobile units away from the border. This would require politicians in the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) to accept checks on farms and in food-production plants and related facilities, something they have opposed so far. Among the other recommendations are the creation of a multi-tier trusted trader programme for large and small companies, with exemptions for small companies. This was proposed by the government in August 2017 and dismissed by the EU. One of the major challenges for the EU and the UK in keeping the border invisible is the issue of standards on food and food processing currently governed by EU regulations. Under mandatory EU rules checks have to be done at the border at special inspection posts with facilities for lab testing and refrigeration to guard against cross-border infection on everything from salmonella to mad cow disease. Such are the rules that in the event of no deal, the EU milk from Northern Ireland will not be permissible in cheese, butter or infant formula made south of the border from day one, potentially devastating the dairy sector which sends 30% of its milk to the republic. Morgan and Hands say in the foreword to the report that the interim recommendations reflect the commission\u2019s commitment to find solutions \u201ccompatible with any of the potential Brexit outcomes\u201d including the current withdrawal agreement. The report found that any alternative arrangements must recognise \u201cthe supremacy of the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement\u201d (GFA) and the preservation of the common travel area. They should also recognise the need for a trade policy in the UK that is independent of the EU, and the need to ensure east-west trade flows as easily as possible. The report also states that all future proposals \u201cmust be based on consent\u201d, one of the central tenets of the GFA and a recognition of the two heritages in Northern Ireland. Common all-island regimes should continue and where possible \u201cbuilt upon\u201d. Special arrangements such as special economic zones and common SPS regimes could \u201cpotentially span not only the island of Ireland\u201d but also Britain with a common rule book, like the Australia-New Zealand Food Safety Area. The report suggests such an arrangement would allow Ireland to break the EU\u2019s common rule book if the UK diverged from EU standards and regulations. This would, for instance, apply if the UK decided to do a trade deal with the US enabling chlorinated chicken to enter the country. This, it notes, would need checks in harbours, ports and airports in Northern Ireland to protect the entire island of Ireland, but this should be a decision for the Northern Ireland assembly. This scenario is predicated on Ireland having a side deal with the EU for a common rule book on the two countries and suggests Ireland would have the unilateral power to deviate from this, even though the EU is based on a system of rules that apply to all member states and not just one. Last October the DUP rejected any checks at ports or airports in Northern Ireland, arguing it would cut the region off from the rest of the UK, while the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, struck a similar position saying the government would \u201cnever ever allow a border down the Irish Sea\u201d. And last week the government finally released a mapping exercise which showed the extent to which the border issue impacted non-trade issues with 142 issues including healthcare for heart patients. The commission was set up by Prosperity UK, an organisation created in 2017 that describes itself as an independent platform bringing together business, academics and policymakers to look constructively at the UK\u2019s future outside the EU. It said it welcomed the opportunity for feedback so it could \u201crefine\u201d its recommendations. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium director, Aodh\u00e1n Connolly aid economic freezones would create borders within borders.

When Alex said he thought they might have wandered into some suitable night parrot habitat, the rangers were all \u201csure why not, let\u2019s put out the camera traps\u201d. \u201cWell actually,\u201d Alex may have said, camera traps are a terrible why of getting proof of night parrots, why in Queensland it took camera traps six years to get two not very good photos of those little feathery scamps.

Oh come on.</p> <p>Scientists prefer to use sound recording gear called song meters \u2013 it gives one a much greater chance of finding something because the bird just has to make a noise in the vicinity, not walk/fly directly in front of it.

      "bodyText": "The ABC has asked the federal court to set aside the warrant that authorised the Australian federal police raid earlier this month and to demand the return of seized files. The AFP raided the broadcaster earlier this month over a 2017 report into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan. The raid on the public broadcaster\u2019s headquarters came just one day after the AFP raided the home of a News Corp political editor over articles she published in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. The Australian reported on Monday that News Corp will also mount a legal challenge against the AFP raid on Annika Smethurst\u2019s home. The ABC chair, Ita Buttrose, and ABC managing director, David Anderson, strongly condemned the raids on the public broadcaster earlier this month. \u201cIt is important that Australians be advised of this action and of the determination of the ABC to defend our journalists and the crucial work they do informing the public,\u201d Anderson said on Monday. \u201cThe ABC is asking the court for a declaration that the warrant was invalid on several technical grounds that underline the fundamental importance of investigative journalism and protection of confidential sources. \u201cWe are also challenging the constitutional validity of the warrant on the basis that it hinders our implied freedom of political communication. \u201cThe ABC is also seeking a permanent injunction to prevent the AFP accessing the material seized and to return it to us immediately. It is currently being held by the AFP in sealed envelopes.\u201d The application won\u2019t be heard until the end of July at the earliest and the AFP has given the ABC an undertaking not to access the seized files. Anderson told staff that management would use \u201cevery avenue\u201d over the next few weeks to defend journalism and the public\u2019s right to know. The ABC has partnered with commercial media including News Corp and Nine Entertainment to push for legislative change. In a rare show of unity, Anderson, executive chairman of News Corp Australasia Michael Miller and Nine CEO Hugh Marks will speak at the National Press Club on Wednesday.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuel Macron\u2019s plan for the biggest wave of French privatisations in a decade is under threat after opposition politicians took the unusual step of joining ranks to push for a referendum on the sale of Paris airports. The centrist French president wants to sell the state\u2019s controlling stake in A\u00e9roports de Paris, the profitable operator of Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, which are used by more than 100 million passengers each year. It would be among the biggest privatisation operations in French history, alongside Macron\u2019s plans to sell other stakes in the national lottery as well as the gas and power group ENGIE. The privatisation on the Paris airports is a crucial part of Macron\u2019s modernisation plans for the French economy. A source close to the president said the state was not best qualified to run airport shopping and, with Charles de Gaulle ranked low for passenger experience, private managers could improve that.

      "bodyText": "The Arab world is turning its back on religion and on US relations, according to the largest public opinion survey ever carried out in the region. A survey of more than 25,000 people across 10 countries and the Palestinian territories found that trust in religious leaders has plummeted in recent years. The study, compiled by BBC News Arabic and Arab Barometer, a Princeton University-based research network, also identified a marked rise in the proportion of people describing themselves as \u201cnot religious\u201d \u2013 from 11% in 2012-2014 to 18% this year. Just 12% of the countries surveyed \u2013 which included Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen \u2013 had a positive view of Donald Trump. More than twice as many (28%) felt positively towards Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, while Turkey\u2019s Recep Erdogan fared the best (51%). At least 60% of respondents in eight of the 11 places surveyed said violence against the US was a logical consequence of interference in the region. The sentiment was most pronounced in Lebanon, Palestine and Yemen, where 75% or more of those surveyed were of this view. Respondents also expressed concern over rising disquiet in their home countries: people in Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Palestine and Sudan, said they felt they were sliding towards dictatorship. More than six in 10 Algerians, and four in 10 Sudanese, believe the last elections were not free and fair, the survey found. Michael Robbins, the director of Arab Barometer, said the survey \u2013 which was conducted at random in private and face-to-face, and consisted largely of multiple-choice questions answered on a tablet \u2013 presented a number of significant findings. \u201cMost importantly, in the vast majority of countries surveyed, governments are not meeting the expectations of their citizens,\u201d said Robbins. \u201cOften, trust in government tracks more closely with performance on providing security than on economic issues.\u201d Respondents expressed a change in attitudes over a number of other issues, from migration and mental health to women\u2019s and LGBT rights. RELIGION The proportion of people who said they were not religious rose from 11% in 2012-14 to 18% in 2019. Trust in religious leaders has also decreased everywhere but Yemen. Iraq, Palestine and Sudan showed the steepest drops in confidence. Trust in Islamist movements, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Muslim Brotherhood, is even lower than for religious leaders Faith in Tunisia\u2019s Ennahda party has declined by 24% in Tunisia since 2011, by 21% in Jordan since 2012, and by 20% since 2013 in Morocco, the survey claims. WOMEN\u2019S RIGHTS Across the region, most respondents supported a woman\u2019s right to divorce her husband but felt that husbands rather than wives should have the final say on family decisions. In 91% of the places surveyed, majorities said women should be allowed to serve as head of government in a Muslim country, but the same margin claimed that men are better political leaders. The notion of a female political president or prime minister was most acceptable in Lebanon, Morocco and Tunisia, and least acceptable in Algeria and Sudan. Dima Dabbous, Equality Now\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and North Africa, said the apparent contradiction in responses was \u201cindicative of the dominant mood in the region\u201d. \u201cThere is a realisation that gender equality is a marker of progress and the \u2018right thing\u2019 to say is to support women empowerment. But when the framing of the question focuses on the role of men, then the real patriarchal, male-centric bias comes to the surface,\u201d said Dabbous. \u201cWomen in the Middle East and North Africa are getting more educated and participating increasingly in the labour force, but their empowerment will remain incomplete as long as they are still excluded from decision-making positions and political participation.\u201d MIGRATION More than half (52%) of 18- to 29-year-olds surveyed in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine and Tunisia said they were considering migrating \u2013 an increase of 10% from 2016 figures. Moroccan adults under 30 exhibited the greatest desire to leave their home country, with 70% thinking about emigrating. But almost half the entire population surveyed in Jordan and Sudan, and one-third in Iraq, said they were contemplating leaving. Europe was the first choice for North Africans, while Egyptians, Sudanese and Yemenis favoured the Gulf. North America was the top destination for people in Jordan and Lebanon, according to the survey. The figures also revealed that potential migrants would be willing to leave without official papers: more than 40% of Algerians, Sudanese and Tunisians, and 38% of Iraqis, Moroccans and Yemenis said they would leave without formal documentation. LGBT RIGHTS In the West Bank, only 5% of respondents said it was acceptable to be gay; in Lebanon, the figure was 6%, while in Iraq, Jordan and Tunisia it was 7%. Algeria showed the greatest tolerance, with 26% of respondents expressing no objection to homosexuality. For taboo or difficult questions, respondents were asked to select \u201cacceptable practices\u201d from a series of options. People believed \u201chonour\u201d killings were more acceptable than being gay in all but one of the countries where this question was asked (Algeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Palestine, Sudan and Tunisia). In Algeria, for example, 26% of respondents said being gay was acceptable, while 27% believed \u201chonour\u201d killings were acceptable; in Jordan, the figures were 7% and 21%. Sudan was the only country where a greater number of respondents found homosexuality more acceptable than \u201chonour\u201d killings (17% v 14%). Dabbous said the responses demonstrated a machismo still heavily prevalent across the region. \u201cOf course \u2018honour\u2019 killings are more acceptable than homosexuality. [They] preserve a social order based on \u2018male honour\u2019 and dominant masculinity \u2013 which is heterosexual \u2013 while homosexuality is a threat to it.\u201d MENTAL HEALTH On average, one in three people surveyed said they felt depressed, with the highest proportion in Iraq (43%), Tunisia (40%) and Palestine (37%). Women and less affluent respondents appeared most affected, the survey found. This article was corrected on 24 June 2019 because it said trust in religious leaders has decreased in every country surveyed except Lebanon. The exception is Yemen.",

      "bodyText": "Darwin residents have reported buildings swaying and parts of the city centre have been evacuated after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit the city. The epicentre of the earthquake was in the Banda Sea, north of Timor-Leste, on Monday and prompted reports of large tremors in the Top End city. The Bureau of Meteorology issued an alert just after 1pm saying there was no tsunami threat to Australia following the earthquake. Residents in Darwin reported large tremors and feeling tables shake but there were no immediate reports of major damage or injury. Jonathan Bathgate, a seismologist at Geoscience Australia, said the 7.2 magnitude earthquake had occurred just before midday approximately 700km (435 miles) north of Darwin. The quake had hit at a depth of about 200km below the sea. \u201cIt was certainly something that was felt quite strongly in the Darwin CBD area,\u201d he said. A Darwin resident, Leah Potter, told Guardian Australia it had felt like \u201ceverything was rocking\u201d. \u201cIt felt like there were two,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst there was just a little one and my son came in wondering what was happening, then there was a pause and there was a really a big one and the place was rocking. \u201cWe went outside and there were backpackers, I don\u2019t know what country they were from, but they were holding on to the railing looking pretty scared. But, yeah, everything was rocking for a while.\u201d A Palmerston resident, Kavinda Weerachandra, said some small cracks had appeared on his wall after the quake. He was at home working when \u201call of a sudden everything started shaking\u201d. \u201cI didn\u2019t think much of it first but as time goes [on] it got stronger,\u201d he said. \u201cI can hear my house creaking and rattling. And things on my desk started to fall. And I was genuinely worried for my life for a second there.\u201d Parts of the city\u2019s central business district were evacuated after the tremor. Domenic Fracaro was one of hundreds of residents and office workers evacuated during the earthquake. He told the ABC he had been preparing lunch at a kitchen bench \u201cwhen I heard this roar\u201d. \u201cI thought it was a jet aircraft down very low, and my wife started running for the front door,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the drawers started opening in the kitchen, and I said to her, \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 \u201cAnd she said, \u2018It\u2019s an earthquake, come on, let\u2019s get out of here.\u2019 \u201cSo I left everything there and we ran down the fire escape, but while we were in that stairwell, the stairwell was rocking that hard, just side to side. \u201cI lost my balance, a couple of times. It\u2019s the worst one I\u2019ve ever experienced in the four years we\u2019ve been here, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Bathgate said earthquakes of that magnitude were not uncommon in the Banda Sea. \u201cWe get magnitude sevens not often but on a regular sort of basis,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last magnitude seven in this area was in 2012 at 7.1, and prior to that there was a 7.1 in 2005. They happen sort of once every 10 years or even more frequently than that.\u201d The quake came just hours after a 6.1-magnitude earthquake hit Papua, also in the eastern part of the south-east Asian archipelago. That quake hit about 240km west of the town of Abepura in Papua province, at a relatively shallow depth of 21km, according to the United States Geological Survey. There were also no immediate reports of casualties. A shallower 6.3-magnitude hit the area last week, but the damage was not extensive. Indonesia experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity owing to its position on the Pacific \u201cRing of Fire\u201d, where tectonic plates collide. A University of Melbourne earthquake scientist, Assoc Prof Mark Quigley, told Guardian Australia that seismic activity in the region tended to \u201cebb and flow\u201d. \u201cThe seismic activity waxes and wanes all the time \u2013 it\u2019s one of the more seismic active parts of the planet,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we get ebbs and flows and sometimes they talk to each other, they communicate stresses along the plate boundary and set others off.

Then Parsons and her wife, whom she met and married after the child\u2019s birth, decided to move to New Zealand, and Masson took legal action to prevent being separated from his child. In 2017, the family court handed down its decision recognising Masson as a legal parent based on the Family Law Act 1975, noting Masson\u2019s intention at the time of conception and his subsequent involvement in the child\u2019s life. The mothers appealed to the full bench of the family court, arguing that actually state law applied in this situation (NSW Children\u2019s Act 1996), citing the section that states that when a woman conceives a child via a fertilisation procedure with a man who is not her husband, that man is not the father. The full court agreed and Masson was presumed not to be the father. What the courts in this case were actually debating was the question of which jurisdiction creates the laws on donor conception: state of federal? Masson appealed to the high court, which last week ruled that he was the child\u2019s father, based on \u201cthe ordinary accepted meaning of the word parent\u201d. The high court has ruled what it deemed to be in the best interest of the child, a standard that is applied in disputes around parental roles and donors in most western countries. Put simply: the child considers Masson to be her dad. But what does it mean to the donor conception community? Essentially, the definition of parents has been found to include sperm donors, as long as they meet the definition of \u201cparent\u201d. What this doesn\u2019t mean is that all sperm donors are now considered dads. There is no need for sperm donors to freak out that their offspring will show up demanding inheritance and to call them dad, and there\u2019s no reason for mums to fear a stranger suddenly demanding contact with their child. In the case of my daughters, Greta and Aurora, their sperm donor is unknown to us and has never played any role in their lives at all, let alone parental roles. It\u2019s a different story for those families who have used known donors \u2013 and that may be troubling for the thousands of Australian families who have relationships with their donors. The accepted wisdom is that knowing their donor and having some connection with them can greatly benefit a child\u2019s mental and emotional development. The concern is that following the high court decision, parents may limit, cut off or deny relationships with the sperm donor for fear they may at some stage assert their role as parent. At the very least, this case is a cautionary tale about the dangers of entering into private and informal parenting agreements with friends. I felt very safe and comfortable accessing donor sperm through a clinic because I knew the clinic had covered all legal bases. My children\u2019s sperm donor has been counselled and has signed documents stating that he understands that he is donor and the rights and responsibility that entails. I also had counselling and signed documents. There are no grey areas. Although, it must be remembered that prior to same-sex couples and single women being allowed access to donor sperm programs in 2010, private and informal arrangements were one of very few options open to these members of our community. If this court case has shown anything, it\u2019s the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes a \u201cparent\u201d in an age when it can take three people to make a baby, and many more to raise them. \u2022 Margaret Ambrose is a journalist and editor of The Baby Project",

      "bodyText": "Finance guru Scott Pape, aka the Barefoot Investor, will have a new TV show, thanks to a deal with Foxtel announced today. The four-part documentary, titled Money School, will follow the bestselling author as he rolls out a financial education program for primary and secondary schools, which he said he hopes will help address crippling debt burdens in Australian households. \u201cKids spend a total of around 2,300 days at school,\u201d Pape said. \u201cYet not even one of those days is dedicated to teaching them essential money skills. \u201cToo many Australians don\u2019t have the skills to pay the bills. Most of us had to learn these skills the hard way because we were never taught them in school.\u201d Pape\u2019s foray into personal finance education for children began last year with the publication of his book The Barefoot Investor for Families, a how-to guide for parents in teaching basic financial literacy to their kids. The book, which broke first-week sales records for non-fiction books in Australia, covers topics such as rewards for doing chores, pocket money, savings and donating to charities. \u201cMy goal is that by teaching the kids, we help their parents too,\u201d Pape said. Pape self-published his eponymous book and guide to personal finance, The Barefoot Investor, in 2004. It has been updated three times since, and Pape claims to have sold more than 1.5 million copies. The book\u2019s popularity saw Pape become a regular guest on Australian television and radio, and become a columnist for News Corp papers. His influence was also cited in the recent banking royal commission after his endorsement of Hostplus resulted in a massive influx of capital to the superannuation fund. Pape announced last week that he was going to close down his business, the private \u201cwealth-building community\u201d Blueprint, at the end of June 2020 in order to move into not-for-profit financial counselling. Money School is expected to premiere on Foxtel\u2019s Lifestyle channel in early 2020.",

There\u2019s a lot going on in this bucolic area, with great coastal and rainforest walks, blowholes, farmers\u2019 markets, country pubs and beachside cafes to warm you up after a swim or surf. Here is our itinerary for the ultimate three days in the Kiama area. Day 1 Parfait Patisserie 8am If you set off early from Sydney or Canberra you\u2019ll make it into Kiama by mid-morning. When you hit town, grab a coffee at the Brooding Italian, which roasts its own beans - a tip from local dairy farmer, Kel Grey, from the Pines. 10am Call in at Parfait Patisserie to pick up pastry on the way through town. 11am Drive up into the Minnamurra Rainforest for a walk. Grey says this is a good spot for kids. \u201cThere\u2019s a short 1km loop, which is all boardwalk that you can do with a pram or with toddlers,\u201d he says. Keep going up to Barren Grounds and take an easy 2km walk to the lookout for views over Kiama and the escarpment. Or push on for another 8km along the Griffiths walking track. 12pm On the way back, stop at the Jamberoo Pub. \u201cIt\u2019s the best pub in the region,\u201d Grey says. There\u2019s live music on Sundays, and the pub is an icon for motorbike riders, who love the winding road leading up to Jamberoo. Grab a counter meal here, or head back to Kiama for lunch at the Hungry Monkey. Grey recommends the burgers and great coffee. 2pm Check in to your accommodation at Kelly Cottage, on a working farm overlooking the stunning Jamberoo Valley. 4pm Visit the Little Blowhole, a natural sea cave formed from volcanic lava. \u201cIt\u2019s smaller than the iconic Kiama blowhole, but just as impressive,\u201d Grey says. Look out for migrating whales between May and November. 5pm Pop your head into the Little Blowhole Art Bar, open from midday Friday to Sunday, showcasing contemporary local art. Or grab a hot chocolate at Little Earth Cafe. 6pm In the early evening, enjoy the views and have a drink at the Hill Bar + Kitchen in Gerringong and settle in for dinner at the Blue Swimmer, an iconic seafood restaurant on the Gerroa foreshore. Day 2 Werri Beach, Kiama 8am For a refreshing start, head down for a swim at Werri Beach in Gerringong, or a dip in the South Werri Rock Pool. 9am Thaw out with a coffee in the sun at the Gerringong Surf Club cafe, across the road from the beach. Then head up the hill to the main street of Gerringong (Fern Street) for breakfast at the Clay Coffee Collective, tucked into an arcade. Coffee is served in homemade ceramics and there\u2019s a small menu of toasties, open sandwiches and baked goods. 11am Walk around the main strip of shops in Gerringong - there are lots of homewares stores in which to browse, including Oak Home Living, Corner D\u2019or Homewares and 34 Degrees South Trading Company. 12.30 Drive back to Kiama for lunch at Penny Whistlers. \u201cIt\u2019s a top spot with views across the harbour to the lighthouse,\u201d Grey says. 2pm If you\u2019re in town midweek, visit the Kiama Farmers\u2019 Market on Wednesday afternoons from 2-5pm in Winter. Grey sells cheese, milk and gelato from the Pines, alongside producers including Pecora Dairy, Buena Vista Farm (which runs farm workshops teaching cheesemaking and fermenting), Schottlanders Wagyu beef, Kareelah Berry Farm and Moonacres organic farm. Other markets include the Gerringong Village Market on the third Saturday of every month, and the Kiama Seaside Markets at Black Beach on the third Sunday of the month. In the afternoon have a surf lesson with one of several local surf schools. Choose from Land\u2019s Edge, Surf Camp Australia, or Gerringong Surf School, run by former big wave pro surfer Rusty Moran at Seven Mile Beach. \u201cWe teach kids from the age of three to adults in their 50s,\u201d Moran says. \u201cMental health and mindfulness is a real focus at our school \u2026 we approach surfing with a holistic view to calm the nervous system and energise ourselves mentally, spiritually and physically.\u201d 4pm Drop in to the cellar door at Crooked River Wines, a family-owned vineyard on an incredible property. As well as wine tasting, the winery also offers a restaurant, a brewery (Uncle Joe\u2019s Brew) and an impressive line up of events. 7pm Feast on modern Italian with dinner at Silica. Chef Luke Basic is making waves with his use of local produce. Day 3 Stoic Brewing 7am Get up early for a stretch at Emergence Yoga. It also offers meditation, pilates and tai chi classes. 8.30am Refuel post-yoga with a nourishing breakfast bowl, Kiama bliss smoothie or brekkie burrito at the wholefoods eatery, Wild Patch. You\u2019ll also find kombucha on tap; ask the staff for the flavour of the day. 10am Complete a section of the stunning Kiama Coast Walk, which can be done in small or large sections. In full, it\u2019s 22km, but taken in short bits it can be less than a kilometre. Grey recommends doing the 6km from Kiama to Gerringong, for which you should allow three hours. You can do it on mountain bikes too. Alternatively, head to the Minnamurra Headland (on the walk but also accessible by car), where there is a whale watching platform. 2pm For lunch try Stoic Brewing in Gerringong. Try a brew on tap, or order a tasting paddle to try them all. The brewery often has food trucks and music on a Sunday afternoon. Book your ultimate winter weekend away in the Unspoilt South Coast",

And that\u2019s as it should be as Lee \u2013 a rare natural talent and more physically gifted golfer than Green \u2013 is already a five-time winner at the top level and seems destined to win multiple important championships.</p> <p>Their paths to the top echelons of golf have differed greatly, Lee easily meeting qualifying criteria as soon as she joined the pay-for-play ranks in 2014, while Green\u2019s journey was more circuitous.</p> <p>With no status to play the LPGA after turning pro in 2016, she made the difficult decision to commit to a full year on the much less lucrative secondary Symetra Tour.</p> <p>The top 15 money earners on that Tour \u2013 and any player who wins three times in a single season \u2013 are given access to the main circuit the following year. It\u2019s a difficult road to tread financially and emotionally but Green determined that was her best chance to advance her career and so signed on.</p> <p>As it turned out, the decision paid dividends. She won three times and finished in the top 15 of the money list to book a rookie season on the LPGA Tour in 2018.</p> <p>She did little to attract attention but enough to keep her card her first year out \u2013 the main aim of every professional golfer at the start of every season \u2013 and was on a similar trajectory in 2019. Until this past week.</p> <p>To say Green\u2019s win was a surprise in no way disparages the 22-year-old or her talents.

      "bodyText": "Prior to that incredibly pressure-packed five-foot putt putt on the final green at Hazeltine Golf Club, Hannah Green was a virtual unknown outside golf circles. In fact even within the golf world \u2013 beyond Australian shores \u2013 she was hardly recognisable to most, a fact confirmed by the lack of even a Wikipedia page devoted to her career. That has since been corrected, but for those who follow the game closely in this part of the world Green has been a known entity since her teenage years. In the mainstream media it is fellow Western Australian Minjee Lee who receives the bulk of the golf spotlight. And that\u2019s as it should be as Lee \u2013 a rare natural talent and more physically gifted golfer than Green \u2013 is already a five-time winner at the top level and seems destined to win multiple important championships. Their paths to the top echelons of golf have differed greatly, Lee easily meeting qualifying criteria as soon as she joined the pay-for-play ranks in 2014, while Green\u2019s journey was more circuitous. With no status to play the LPGA after turning pro in 2016, she made the difficult decision to commit to a full year on the much less lucrative secondary Symetra Tour. The top 15 money earners on that Tour \u2013 and any player who wins three times in a single season \u2013 are given access to the main circuit the following year. It\u2019s a difficult road to tread financially and emotionally but Green determined that was her best chance to advance her career and so signed on. As it turned out, the decision paid dividends. She won three times and finished in the top 15 of the money list to book a rookie season on the LPGA Tour in 2018. She did little to attract attention but enough to keep her card her first year out \u2013 the main aim of every professional golfer at the start of every season \u2013 and was on a similar trajectory in 2019. Until this past week. To say Green\u2019s win was a surprise in no way disparages the 22-year-old or her talents. It simply acknowledges the harsh truth of top flight professional golf which is that even the very best spend a lot more time losing than winning. For a player ranked outside the top 100 in the world (Green was 114 at the start of the week) to outplay the current world No 1 and a host of other previous major winners over 72 holes is, mathematically, unlikely. It is why her win is being hailed as such an achievement, particularly outside Australia where few, if any, knew her name before today. The victory is also testament to an inner fortitude that might be almost as important as physical talent at the highest levels of the game. Those who have experienced it say there is no pressure as stifling as the final nine holes of a major championship with a chance to win. Green stood up to every imaginable test in Minnesota, including nursing a significant lead \u2013 not as easy as it sounds \u2013 and weathering a patch of poor play mid round. Add in the pressure from the world class field lined up behind her and the scope of her accomplishment begins to come into focus. Only two other Australian women have ever claimed a golf major: Jan Stephenson won three and the legendary Karrie Webb seven. Hannah Green \u2013 unknown to many at the start of the week but the name on everybody\u2019s list at the end of it \u2013 now becomes the third Australian major winner.

      "bodyText": "Financial markets around the world are braced for a renewed period of turbulence this week as the US readies fresh sanctions against Iran and amid rising hopes for a breakthrough in the US-China trade war. Donald Trump tweeted over the weekend that \u201cmajor\u201d additional sanctions were being prepared to use against Iran from Monday to block Tehran from developing nuclear weapons. Washington\u2019s relations with Tehran have worsened after Trump aborted a military strike following the downing of a US spy drone last week, with the response threatening to open up another front in the geopolitical disputes holding back the world economy. John Bolton, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said on Sunday that a fresh round of sanctions against Iran would serve as a warning not to \u201cmistake US prudence and discretion for weakness\u201d. The tensions in the Middle East saw the price of oil rise in early trade on Monday, with a barrel of Brent crude up 0.6% to $65.58, near Friday\u2019s three-week high of $65.76. Asian share prices were subdued on Monday but the threat of sanctions rather than a full-scale military intervention by the US gave some comfort to investors. The renewed tensions come as China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, and Trump prepare to meet this week in an attempt to break the deadlock in the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing. Chinese state media reported over the weekend the first official confirmation of Xi\u2019s attendance at the G20 gathering of world leaders in Osaka, Japan, where he is expected to meet with the US president. Set against a backdrop of simmering hostility over trade between the two countries, the meeting could provide a potential breakthrough in the dispute that has harmed the resilience of the global economy over the past year. Stock markets around the world have rallied in recent weeks on the back of increased optimism of a deal between Washington and Beijing, while any reversal of the progress towards a resolution could send stocks into a tailspin. Trump and Xi met at the last G20 summit in Argentina in December, reaching a breakthrough at that time before progress was reversed earlier this year. Trump raised tariffs on $200bn (\u00a3157bn) of imports from China from 10% to 25% in May while threatening to impose more on a further $325bn of Chinese goods. China has hit back with its own tariffs, albeit covering fewer imports.",

We have been in this fight before | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nevertheless, progressives should discuss nuclear energy and climate change, if only because the campaign we need against coal can learn from the historic struggle against a different mineral.</p> <p>Upon the opening of the Rum Jungle uranium mine in 1953, Robert Menzies gushed: \u201cWe, in Australia, are lucky indeed, that we should have found, within our own boundaries, deposits of this ore which can and will undoubtedly within a measurable distance bring power and light and the amenities of life to the producers and consumers and the housewives of this continent.\u201d</p> <p>You feel that if he could have brought a lump of the stuff into parliament he probably would have done so.</p> <p>Yet by the second half of the 70s, activists concerned about the environmental consequences of mining, the effects on Indigenous communities, and Australia\u2019s role in the nuclear arms race, had made uranium mining into a national controversy.</p> <p>In 1977, the Movement Against Uranium Mining collected 250,000 signatures within a few months for a moratorium on mining. Later that year 20,000 people joined rallies in both Sydney and Melbourne.</p> <p>The activists then confronted the same arguments about mining and jobs we hear today about Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine. Yet as historian Verity Burgmann says, organised labour was \u201cinvolved in the [anti-uranium] movement from its very earliest stages\u201d.</p> <p>The key struggles were led by rank-and-file unionists, often in defiance of prominent officials.</p> <p>In 1976 Jim Assenbruck, a railway worker in Townsville, refused, in accordance with the recently adopted policy of the Australian Railways Union, to load materials intended for the Mary Kathleen uranium mine.</p> <p>His subsequent suspension sparked a national rail strike.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/23/politicians-reluctance-on-climate-change-is-bizarre-action-would-not-only-be-right-but-popular\">Politicians\u2019 reluctance on climate change is bizarre \u2013 action would not only be right but popular | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, Jack Egerton, the ACTU\u2019s senior vice president and an important Labor politician, came out in support of uranium using very familiar rhetoric.</p> <p>\u201cRailwaymen,\u201d he said, \u201cwho are among the low-income earners in the community, should not be the pawn in the game of environmental politics.\u201d</p> <p>Egerton explicitly cast the rail workers as dupes when, in fact, those \u201clow-income earners\u201d were perfectly capable of making their own decisions \u2013 and had chosen of their own accord not to support environmental destruction.</p> <p>Like many politicians who proclaim the importance of coal jobs, Egerton was not exactly an impartial commentator, given he moonlighted as a director of the Mary Kathleen mine.</p> <p>In 1977 Melbourne wharfies called a 24-hour strike of the entire port after the arrival of the yellowcake laden ship Columbus Australia. The Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers\u2019 Federation eventually imposed a ban on that ship and all future vessels carrying uranium \u2013 and they so in defiance of their own, more conservative, federal leadership.</p> <p>Obviously that was a different time.</p> <p>Today unionism is far weaker, with the rank and file less active.</p> <p>But that bureaucratisation makes the examples from the anti-uranium struggle particularly compelling.</p> <p>Why did the Melbourne wharfies walk off the job?</p> <p>In part they were inspired by the courage of anti-nuclear protesters, over 40 of whom were violently arrested in what the Australian dubbed \u201cthe wildest demo since Vietnam\u201d.</p> <p>The environmental activists\u2019 determination <a href=\"http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110853084\">in the face of \u201cbrute force\u201d from mounted police</a> encouraged the unionists to take action themselves \u2013 and that action then spread.</p> <p>Such was the pattern of the campaign.</p> <p>The momentum eventually persuaded the Australian Labor party to abandon its previous support for uranium.

      "bodyText": "What do Clive Palmer, Tony Abbott, Cory Bernardi, Barnaby Joyce, Mark Latham, Jim Molan, Craig Kelly, Eric Abetz and David Leyonhjelm have in common? No doubt many answers will come to to mind. But whatever else unites them, they all support nuclear power. Jim Green from Friends of the Earth Australia, which compiled the above list, says that nuclear energy now functions more as a culture war troll than a serious policy, not least because the people who want atomic solution to climate change are usually the same people (as the group above illustrates) who don\u2019t believe climate change requires a solution at all. Despite the best efforts of Queensland conservatives, Australia will not go nuclear. The former chair of Uranium King, Warwick Grigor, says flatly: \u201cNo one is going down that path in the foreseeable future.\u201d Even industry boosters see nuclear power stations as feasible only if the government introduces, um, a carbon tax, a proposal to which the culture warriors would react like vampires to garlic. Nevertheless, progressives should discuss nuclear energy and climate change, if only because the campaign we need against coal can learn from the historic struggle against a different mineral. Upon the opening of the Rum Jungle uranium mine in 1953, Robert Menzies gushed: \u201cWe, in Australia, are lucky indeed, that we should have found, within our own boundaries, deposits of this ore which can and will undoubtedly within a measurable distance bring power and light and the amenities of life to the producers and consumers and the housewives of this continent.\u201d You feel that if he could have brought a lump of the stuff into parliament he probably would have done so. Yet by the second half of the 70s, activists concerned about the environmental consequences of mining, the effects on Indigenous communities, and Australia\u2019s role in the nuclear arms race, had made uranium mining into a national controversy. In 1977, the Movement Against Uranium Mining collected 250,000 signatures within a few months for a moratorium on mining. Later that year 20,000 people joined rallies in both Sydney and Melbourne. The activists then confronted the same arguments about mining and jobs we hear today about Adani\u2019s Carmichael coalmine. Yet as historian Verity Burgmann says, organised labour was \u201cinvolved in the [anti-uranium] movement from its very earliest stages\u201d. The key struggles were led by rank-and-file unionists, often in defiance of prominent officials. In 1976 Jim Assenbruck, a railway worker in Townsville, refused, in accordance with the recently adopted policy of the Australian Railways Union, to load materials intended for the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. His subsequent suspension sparked a national rail strike. In response, Jack Egerton, the ACTU\u2019s senior vice president and an important Labor politician, came out in support of uranium using very familiar rhetoric. \u201cRailwaymen,\u201d he said, \u201cwho are among the low-income earners in the community, should not be the pawn in the game of environmental politics.\u201d Egerton explicitly cast the rail workers as dupes when, in fact, those \u201clow-income earners\u201d were perfectly capable of making their own decisions \u2013 and had chosen of their own accord not to support environmental destruction. Like many politicians who proclaim the importance of coal jobs, Egerton was not exactly an impartial commentator, given he moonlighted as a director of the Mary Kathleen mine. In 1977 Melbourne wharfies called a 24-hour strike of the entire port after the arrival of the yellowcake laden ship Columbus Australia. The Melbourne branch of the Waterside Workers\u2019 Federation eventually imposed a ban on that ship and all future vessels carrying uranium \u2013 and they so in defiance of their own, more conservative, federal leadership. Obviously that was a different time. Today unionism is far weaker, with the rank and file less active. But that bureaucratisation makes the examples from the anti-uranium struggle particularly compelling. Why did the Melbourne wharfies walk off the job? In part they were inspired by the courage of anti-nuclear protesters, over 40 of whom were violently arrested in what the Australian dubbed \u201cthe wildest demo since Vietnam\u201d. The environmental activists\u2019 determination in the face of \u201cbrute force\u201d from mounted police encouraged the unionists to take action themselves \u2013 and that action then spread. Such was the pattern of the campaign. The momentum eventually persuaded the Australian Labor party to abandon its previous support for uranium. At the national conference of 1977, the party passed a historic resolution for an indefinite moratorium. Unfortunately, that motion encouraged the movement to, as Burgmann writes, throw itself \u201cwholeheartedly into supporting the Labor party to regain government\u201d \u2013 rather in the way that Bill Shorten\u2019s climate rhetoric led activists to back the ALP during the 2019 election campaign. Then, as now, the reliance on Labor proved disastrous. In 1982 the ALP overturned the 1977 position. When Bob Hawke came to power the next year, mining continued under the very government for which many anti-uranium activists had campaigned. The movement\u2019s real strength always depended on its grassroots \u2013 on the willingness of activists to defy the rightwingers in Labor and the unions, even to the extent of facing arrest. In Queensland for instance, the corrupt and authoritarian regime of Joh Bjelke-Petersen tried to physically prevent the anti-uranium marches of 1977, with 418 people facing 566 charges after a single march in October, mostly for \u201ctaking part in an unlawful procession\u201d. Thereafter Bjelke-Petersen banned marches altogether. \u201cProtest groups need not bother applying for permits to stage marches because they won\u2018t be granted ...\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s government policy now.\u201d The anti-nuclear cause thus became, for Queenslanders, a proxy for other issues, not least basic civil liberties. The Brisbane rally last week of more than 700 people against the Adani coalmine recalled that history, with Greens councillor Jonathan Sri telling attendees that \u201cmass civil disobedience\u201d would be necessary to stop the mine. \u201cRight now,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat we need is as many people as possible who are willing to get arrested, who are willing to put their bodies on the line. \u2026 You need to mobilise on the streets in large numbers.\u201d He\u2019s right. If Jim Assenbruck could risk his job in Townsville to oppose uranium in 1976, working-class people in rural Queensland can be convinced to oppose Adani today. But to win them over, we need an independent grassroots movement that shows, through practice, its seriousness. In a time of profound despair, mass civil disobedience over climate \u2013 a cause with tremendous moral weight \u2013 would provide a beacon of hope. It would be a rallying cry for everyone aghast not just at environmental devastation but at the broken political system incapable of preventing it. Jeff Sparrow is a Guardian Australia columnist",

She realised just how powerful story sharing can be, and how it could be used to spread courage and inspiration across communities that needed it. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know. When you gain access to other people\u2019s stories you start to dream bigger.\u201d Recently, Ramsing\u2019s love of stories and respect for their significance have taken her into somewhat unanticipated territory. She started noticing patterns in CALD LGBT journeys, and realised she had taken on more responsibility than she first realised. \u201cIf there\u2019s enough people saying something, then that\u2019s when our government has a role to play in making a change,\u201d she explains. This realisation prompted a move into the policy space: she has presented her findings to various ministers, and sits on the Queensland LGBTI Round table. \u201cI didn\u2019t see that coming \u2013 initially, it was very much people focussed,\u201d she says. \u201cI intuitively knew that just feeling heard is important for the individual. But being able to translate that into policy has been very rewarding. A real catalyst enabling me to do this was having a well-respected and known institution like Westpac back me, back my belief that this is important, that storytelling saves lives. This past year has just been packed with opportunities. It\u2019s all unfolded in ways I didn\u2019t expect - as life does.\u201d The Westpac Social Change Fellowship is one of five programs offered by the Westpac Scholars Trust.

If he is unable to go, Fittler will be scratching for options with Adam Reynolds and Luke Keary both out injured, Mitchell Pearce clearly having little interest in a recall after some suspect injuries kept him out of consideration for the first two games and Cody Walker perhaps scarred from his treatment in the opener. The pressure now sits squarely on the shoulders of Queensland coach Kevin Walters. He will be under pressure to swing the axe like his NSW counterpart. The cupboard in Queensland is more than a little thin though and the most likely scenario is that Walters will attempt to leverage the embarrassment of the humiliating Perth loss to lift his troops. The back three got smashed in metreage and that is an area the Maroons desperately need to get right. Kalyn Ponga had his most forgettable game while Dane Gagai and Corey Oates provided very little carting the ball out of trouble. All are likely safe. The same cannot be said of forwards Dylan Napa and Jarrod Wallace, who both had poor outings. The one ace Walters does have up his sleeve is the phone number of Cameron Smith. Origin lore has been written on the heroic and unexpected comebacks of Alan Langer, Andrew Johns and Fittler himself. A Smith return for one game only with the series on the line and the Maroons mammoth underdogs would truly be the stuff of legend. There have been plenty of indicators this year too that a comeback could be in the offing. It would be a desperate move from Walters. But as Brad Fittler proved, from desperation can come glory.",

Less than three hours flight from the east coast of Australia, New Caledonia feels like a piece of France broke off from Europe and floated to the South Pacific. Yet, thanks to its proud Melanesian heritage and influence, it offers a unique experience entirely of its own. From flying above the famous Heart of Voh to exploring the depths of a sunken naval ship, here are five incredible New Caledonian experiences worth adding to your bucket list. 1.

      "bodyText": "Towards the end of May 2016 Ashleigh Barty signed up for the first qualifying round of the Eastbourne Trophy. The tournament was part of the ITF Women\u2019s Circuit, the tier below the main WTA Tour, and the prize fund was just $50,000. It was early in the grass court season. So early in fact that the red clay of Roland Garros was still dusting the soles of the game\u2019s leading lights. Barty was unranked. She hadn\u2019t played a competitive singles match in almost two years. This was a professional tennis experience so far off Broadway it was barely on a map. Almost exactly three years later Barty is once again on British grass, this time feted as the best player in women\u2019s tennis. The Queenslander is just the 27th player to ascend to the pinnacle of her profession since the WTA began to document the feat in 1975, and just the second Australian, 43 years after Evonne Goolagong Cawley. Few have arrived at the destination by such a circuitous route. A junior prodigy, Barty was the girls\u2019 singles champion at Wimbledon by 15. That was supposed to be a springboard into the sporting elite but despite showing immense promise and reaching three grand slam doubles finals something hadn\u2019t yet clicked into place. Instead of grinding herself down on the circuit Barty bravely stepped away from the game aged only 18 with no guarantee of returning. Shortly afterwards she pursued a career in cricket. This chapter of Barty\u2019s story has been retold so often it risks suffering the reductive effects of semantic satiation, but it deserves contemplation; what she did and has done subsequently is extraordinary. In hindsight the hiatus may prove the defining moment in Barty\u2019s career and perhaps even become a case study for young athletes who specialise at an early age and risk falling out of love with their talent. Barty\u2019s coach Craig Tyzzer certainly thinks so. \u201cIt was the best thing she ever did,\u201d he said. When Barty returned to action in Eastbourne she won six matches in a row, enough to return to the WTA rankings in 623rd place. Five more victories arrived the following week in Nottingham, halving her ranking, and providing the foundation for a return to the main tour in 2017.

Barty 2.0 was stronger and more relaxed, and that fed into more assertive and creative tennis, a style that three years later remains distinctive. \u201cI play a bit of a different game style to a lot of other girls and we\u2019re trying to just keep that uniqueness and really work on a few of those things,\u201d Barty said shortly after her return, teasing the addition of \u201ca few dimensions that we didn\u2019t have or didn\u2019t use as much the first time around.\u201d At 166cm Barty is among the shorter players on the WTA Tour and she needs those added dimensions to compete: the trademark backhand slice, the soft hands at the net honed in doubles play, and the vision and court craft to unhurriedly manipulate points with the forethought of a chess grandmaster. That\u2019s not to suggest Barty is powerless, far from it (especially on serve), but to celebrate that hers is a multidimensional game of which force is one option, not the default. To face Barty on form is to face death by a thousand cuts. Just 14 months after batting at six (and scoring three) for Brisbane Heat against Adelaide Strikers, Barty broke her WTA Tour duck, lifting the Malaysian Open trophy. That was the first of three final appearances in 2017, followed by three more in 2018, culminating in victory at the WTA Elite Trophy in Zhuhai, her biggest title to date and confirmation she was an established top-20 player on an upward trajectory. But nobody could have foreseen the leaps taken this year. On the early season hard courts Barty ground out the best win ratio on tour, pocketing the premier mandatory Miami Open en route. She suffered just two defeats on clay before her landmark French Open triumph. Then without breaking stride she made the difficult transition to grass look effortless, winning five from five in Birmingham. To put that into context, the only other female players to win the singles title at Roland Garros and their next event on British grass have been Serena Williams, Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert and Margaret Court. In amongst all that she\u2019s proven unbeatable in six Fed Cup rubbers, guiding Australia near single-handedly to their first decider in 26 years. The numbers are spectacular, but so are the performances. No match came closer to lifting the roof from Rod Laver Arena at this year\u2019s Australian Open than Barty\u2019s come-from-behind takedown of Maria Sharapova. To win in Miami she had to beat three of the current top five players in the world. She won yesterday knowing the No 1 ranking was on the line.
