Drug traffickers transport cocaine and methamphetamines through Pacific nations from the US and Latin America to Australia and New Zealand, where drug users pay the highest price per gram (about A$300 or \u00a3180) for cocaine and have one of the highest rates of cocaine use per capita in the world. While the route has been in use for decades, law enforcement experts told the Guardian that the quantity of drugs trafficked through it has exploded in the last five years. \u201cWe have to take ownership for the fact that this is a problem impacting the Pacific purely due to Australia and New Zealand\u2019s appetite for cocaine and methamphetamines,\u201d said Jose Sousa-Santos, who researches transnational crime in the Pacific at Massey University in New Zealand. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have Australian and New Zealand drug markets, we wouldn\u2019t have the movement of drugs through the Pacific.\u201d Sousa-Santos said Australia and New Zealand were the cash cows of the region and enduringly big profit margins would only lead to more movement of drugs. As part of the High Seas investigation, the Guardian found that trade through the Pacific is causing grave social harm in nations including Fiji, Samoa and Tonga, which now have domestic markets for the drugs and are suffering from addiction, corruption and violence. John Coyne, head of border security at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said that Pacific nations were the \u201cvictims\u201d of being caught between Australia and its drug supplier. \u201cThey are transit countries for organised crime in the importation of drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has ripple effects on issues such as corruption, foreign bribery, rule of law and those sorts of issues. We shouldn\u2019t underestimate [the impact] the appetite of Australia for illicit drugs has on countries in the Pacific.\u201d Superintendent Brett Kidner, who was based in Fiji as the senior liaison officer in the Pacific for the Australian Federal Police from 2016 to 2019, said the question of Australia\u2019s responsibility for the damaging impact of drugs in the Pacific is a topic that is \u201ckicked around a lot\u201d. \u201cThe Australian federal police, as well as the Australian government take the position very seriously and responsibly, and it\u2019s not a matter that we\u2019re responsible, but we do have a responsibility to our partners in the Pacific \u2026 to work collaboratively to stamp out organised crime and the illicit trade of any commodities, certainly that includes drugs,\u201d he said. Coyne said that the Australian government has \u201ca long history of engagement in the region\u201d and has provided defence programs, training opportunities, patrol boats, air surveillance hours and helped to establish a regional trans-national crime centre in order to assist Pacific nations with the fight against drug trafficking. But Sousa-Santos said that while there were some good initiatives in the region, he had encountered resentment among Pacific communities over the approach taken by Australia and New Zealand. \u201cThat is definitely the feeling on the ground in the Pacific, not only that there are not enough resources being put toward this issue, but they also feel that Australia and New Zealand are trying to protect their own borders, leaving the Pacific as a secondary concern.\u201d \u201cThe attitude still seems to be to stop drugs at the Australia and New Zealand borders and to utilise the Pacific almost as a shield,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the main driver continues to be how to keep Australia and New Zealand safe from the scourge of drugs.\u201d He said there were also complaints that Pacific law enforcement agencies were not treated as equal partners with their Australian and New Zealand counterparts.

The report from international NGO Sisters For Change, in partnership with The Manchester Maya Project, warns of institutional racism and sexism at the local level in Greater Manchester. It also highlights that women and children from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds (BAME) are not being adequately protected or getting the specialist help they need after suffering domestic abuse. These include: Local authorities failing to take account of religious and cultural needs. Failing to provide suitable accommodation to women and their children made homeless following domestic abuse. Police and housing authorities failing to respond adequately to religious hate crimes. Health and social services failing to adequately safeguard BME and migrant women. Cases of local authorities failing to take measures to protect BME and migrant victims of domestic abuse from inhuman or degrading treatment perpetrated by private individuals. Routine failure to provide appropriate interpreters for women with limited or no understanding of English. The report highlights several examples which they say reflect nationwide systemic problems. These include a Muslim woman with four children who was severely abused by her former husband. She was allocated housing in a deprived, predominantly white area of Greater Manchester where she and her children are the victims of hate crimes. They have been spat at, had bricks thrown at their windows and had people trying to break down the door during the early hours. When police attended to take a statement, they had no interpreter, and housing authority officers did not acknowledge that there were any risks associated with the location. Legal director of Sisters For Change, Jane Gordon, said the report \u201cdemonstrates the failure of the police to adequately protect BME and migrant women victims of violence; the failure of health and social services to adequately safeguard BME women and their children; and the failure of local authorities to provide suitable accommodation to BME women and children made homeless by domestic abuse. \u201cAs the UN special rapporteur on racism and xenophobia concluded in her recent report on the UK, \u2018the harsh reality is that race, ethnicity, religion, gender, disability status and related categories all continue to determine the life chances and wellbeing of people in Britain in ways that are unacceptable and, in many cases, unlawful\u2019.\u201d Over a quarter of women in Manchester who are victims of domestic abuse have no recourse to public funds (NRPF), the term applied to someone whose immigration status means they cannot access welfare benefits or publicly funded services such as social housing and healthcare.

      "bodyText": "Homebuyers in a town where properties typically cost almost 12 times local salaries may soon have a low-cost option from Ikea after a UK council agreed to work with an affordable housing developer co-owned by the retailer. Worthing council has signed up with BoKlok, a company jointly owned by the Swedish retailer and construction firm Skanska which specialises in factory-built housing that can be constructed at a low cost. The firm sets property prices so that buyers have money left to live on after they have paid their housing costs, and its website says \u201ca single parent can afford to buy and live in a newly built two-bedroom BoKlok apartment\u201d. It has built 11,000 homes across Sweden, Finland, Denmark and Norway, and is keen to break into the UK after a false start more than a decade ago. Previous plans for a development in Tyneside were scaled back when the financial crisis hit, but its latest effort is a collaboration with Worthing council, which believes it can achieve more affordable homes through the deal than if it sells the land to a conventional developer. Councillors in the coastal town have voted to work on a plan that would see 162 flats built on land that it owns. The latest data from the Office for National Statistics showed that in 2018 average house prices in Worthing were 11.7 times average salaries, compared with a figure of 7.8 times across England and Wales. In a report, the council said that access to homes was challenging for those on the average salary, which was \u00a325,458 in 2015 \u2013 with only one-bedroom properties within reach, it noted. Under the plans the council will license the developer to use the land rather than selling it off, charging it an annual ground rent. In return it will get 30% of the properties to use as affordable housing to rent to local people, while the remaining properties can be sold by BoKlok based on its \u201cleft to live\u201d affordability model. This looks at how much residents can afford to pay after tax and monthly living costs have been deducted, and usually assumes that people can use about 33% of their take-home pay for a mortgage. The council, which has more than 1,300 households on its housing waiting list, said its analysis suggested the land could be used for 45 homes with just 13 of them available for affordable rent. The company said it has \u201cscrutinised our costs and trimmed them to the bone,\u201d but there are no compromises on quality. Flooring and wall tiles are included in the price, and homes are fitted with an Ikea kitchen. Worthing council\u2019s plans show-homes that range from one-bedroom apartments measuring 50 sq metres (538sq ft) to three-bedroom apartments of 74 sq metres (800sq ft). Councillor Kevin Jenkins, Worthing borough council\u2019s executive member for regeneration, said: \u201cIn this current market it\u2019s extremely tough for local people who are in full-time work to get on the housing market. \u201cThis proposal could change that, giving these hard-working individuals a genuine chance to buy their own home without having to move out of the town.\u201d If the plans go ahead work on the site will begin in September 2020, with the first homes would be delivered and assembled the following January, and ready to move into in April 2021. Further homes may follow, with the council and BoKlok agreeing a programme to provide 500 homes in the borough. The project is one of a range of ways councils are working with developers to create more affordable homes for local people. Croydon council has set up a company called Brick by Brick which is building homes for social rent subsidised by homes sold on the open market.",

New data showed a \u201cmarked increase\u201d in reports of potential fraud, with authorities receiving 2,293 tipoffs in the eight months to February, a 48% increase on the 1,553 recorded in the entire 2017-18 financial year. The figures were contained in a Australian National Audit Office report that found the National Disability Insurance Agency had \u201cimproved\u201d its protection measures, after criticism the NDIS was susceptible to fraud. But the report also said: The NDIA has 20 active fraud investigations worth an estimated $9.3m. Claim breaches totalled $4.6m between August and December 2018. Of 38 providers found to have been sanctioned as childcare operators, 25 will be deregistered. Those companies had already reaped $2.3m in NDIA funds. The NDIA prevented an additional \u201c$2m in potentially fraudulent claims in relation to its ongoing investigations\u201d. It comes after a 2016 audit identified a lack of checks and balances within the $20bn scheme, while media reports had uncovered dozens of NDIS providers had chequered histories as family daycare operators. The audit office report noted many of the \u201cenhancement\u201d measures had begun as the new audit got under way. That includes the NDIS fraud taskforce, which was created in July 2018 and combines NDIA and Department of Human Services staff and the federal police.

The data did not specify if the tipoffs related to providers or participants. The agency had \u201clargely appropriate fraud detection and response mechanisms\u201d, with data analytics and data-matching capabilities \u201cbeing progressively implemented\u201d, the audit office said. In October departmental officials admitted they had no way of knowing if newly registered providers had previously defrauded taxpayers. The agency has since established data matching, which was used to identify the 25 providers it now intended to deregister, the audit office said. Providers will soon register with the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission, which is now operating in New South Wales and South Australia and will be rolled out to all states by July 2020. Matthew Bowden, a co-chief executive at People with Disability Australia, welcomed the work to \u201censure people with disability aren\u2019t being ripped off by dodgy providers\u201d. But he warned the agency needed to ensure \u201cpeople with disability retain their privacy and capacity to have control over their plans\u201d when data matching was used. \u201cThe report raises concerns that self-managed participants may be a fraud risk,\u201d he said. \u201cWe would caution against rushing to this conclusion.

      "bodyText": "Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency is facing increasing skepticism from international regulators days after ambitious plans for it were unveiled by the social media company. On Tuesday, Randal Quarles, chair of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), a policy coordinator for G20 countries, said Facebook\u2019s plan to expand into retail payments could lead regulators to take a closer look at such financial instruments. Quarles\u2019s comments mark the first time a senior US regulator has spoken of how they might approach Libra, which aims to transform the global payments markets. Quarles said that while the board did not plan to discuss the issue at this week\u2019s G20 summit in Japan and \u201ccrypto-assets\u201d like Libra did not currently pose a risk to global financial stability, he envisioned gaps where they fall outside the remit of regulators and the oversight of international standards. \u201cA wider use of new types of crypto-assets for retail payment purposes would warrant close scrutiny by authorities to ensure that they are subject to high standards of regulation,\u201d Quarles said in a letter released ahead of the summit and first reported by Reuters. Quarles added: \u201cThe FSB and standard setting bodies will monitor risks very closely and in a coordinated fashion, and consider additional multilateral responses as needed.\u201d The remarks follow an agreement in March 2018 by G20 finance ministers and central bankers to monitor crypto-assets. The FSB has said if Libra takes off, a different regulatory response will be needed. Quarles\u2019s remarks follow a statement from the Bank for International Settlements on Sunday that politicians need to move rapidly to coordinate regulatory responses to any new risks. The FSB\u2019s interjection over Facebook\u2019s Libra, which is backed by more than 20 international institutions including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber and could launch as soon as next year, come as the UK\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority said it would not allow the social media company to use the digital currency without close scrutiny. Andrew Bailey, the head of the UK\u2019s FCA, confirmed on Tuesday that the organization was working with the UK Treasury and the Bank of England to monitor Facebook\u2019s plans. \u201cWe will have to engage domestically and internationally, with Facebook and this other [Libra] organisation. They are not going to walk through authorisation without that,\u201d Mr Bailey told a Treasury select committee. The FSB and the FCA have joined Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, in alerting Facebook that if its plan to attract users to a new currency are successful \u201cit would instantly become systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulation\u201d.

Mauricio Pochettino has made the 22-year-old France international his prime summer target as he seeks new impetus at the club after spending five years in charge, and negotiations with Lyon are at an advanced stage. The French club were holding out for \u20ac75m for Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, who possesses a rare blend of skill and power, and Spurs had previously indicated that they valued him at \u20ac50m.

It is Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 that Pochettino covets and he has told Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, that he is precisely the kind of player that the club ought to be signing. Pochettino does not consider his squad to be a particularly young one any more and Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, who would become his first signing since that of Lucas Moura from Paris St-Germain in January 2018, would bring fresh dynamism. Funds remain tight at the club as Levy balances the repayments on the new stadium project, although the team\u2019s unexpected run to the Champions League final did bring a windfall.

Manuel Pellegrini is an admirer of the Venezuelan after working with him at M\u00e1laga and he hopes to use the news that Ben\u00edtez is set to leave Newcastle to his advantage. Pellegrini wants a new striker after releasing Andy Carroll on a free transfer and selling Lucas P\u00e9rez to Alav\u00e9s.

As forward sizzle goes, it\u2019s not been that kind. Fortunately from a newly re-elected prime minister\u2019s perspective, Sky\u2019s audience is not large.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/22/australias-energy-future-the-real-power-is-not-where-youd-think\">Australia's energy future: the real power is not where you\u2019d think | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The striking thing about the first episode is how successfully it took me back to the <a href=\"https://meanjin.com.au/essays/prime-minister-disrupted/\">maddest couple of weeks I\u2019ve yet witnessed</a> in 20-plus years of political reporting. Boom. You are back there, watching the protagonists narrate their own self-absorbed madness with varying degrees of comprehension, insight, self-knowledge and candour. You are reminded that this group of people declared war on one another at taxpayer expense, and then managed to sweep their war entirely out of view for the duration of an election contest. It\u2019s a bit like meeting up with the relative you haven\u2019t seen since last Christmas, the one that\u2019s been on the serious health kick, but won\u2019t throw out the old suits just in case the cheese platter proves too hard to resist. He\u2019s nibbling on the carrot sticks but the eyes are on the brie.</p> \n<h2>2. There was no big reveal</h2> \n<p>This was a sequence of insights that added texture to a story that has already been carefully documented. The former trade minister Steve Ciobo had a new thought. He told Speers Dutton had revealed to him on the Sunday before everything went absolutely bonkers that he had the numbers to blast Malcolm Turnbull from the leadership. I think Ciobo\u2019s words were he was \u201crelatively confident\u201d Dutton had the numbers. This had been confided during a plane ride to Canberra before a special cabinet session on the Sunday evening that was meant to reconfigure the national energy guarantee in a way that would calm things down. Just in case you were wondering, things didn\u2019t calm down. Sorry if that was a spoiler.</p> \n<h2>3. Peter Dutton never takes a backward step</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s not much of an insight to observe that the home affairs minister, he of the \u201crelatively confident\u201d (oops) numbers, only has one speed. If the cliff approaches, accelerate. But the Dutton story arc was memorable in episode one, even if it just played entirely to type. Let\u2019s just call it Peter Dutton: The No Remorse Story. In this version of history, Malcolm had it coming. Turnbull was a dope who called a leadership spill early in the week (\u201cthe final act of misjudgment\u201d), underscoring his lack of political nous. Turnbull then offered Dutton the deputy Liberal leadership, which wasn\u2019t his gift to give. Turnbull was the mean bastard who wouldn\u2019t let Dutton just take the prime ministership from him without forcing the plotters to put their names to a petition. Turnbull seeking concrete evidence he\u2019d lost the support of the party room was just \u201ca stalling tactic to damage me\u201d and a sign he had reverted to \u201cmerchant banker mode\u201d (possibly that was the counting of names on a petition, it wasn\u2019t really clear). In any case, Pete\u2019s not sorry. He\u2019s a bit sorry he lost when Turnbull called on the death match by demanding that people put their name to their intrigue, in the process handing Morrison, and not Dutton, the prime ministership, thereby outflanking him at the critical juncture. Bit sorry about that. But that\u2019s just Malcolm, isn\u2019t it? An idiot. Obviously. Yeah. Um.</p> \n<p>\u2022&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"MM signup\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. Mathias Cormann is \u2026 shook</h2> \n<p>Just as Dutton\u2019s political character is fixed, seemingly devoid of surprises, the finance minister also opened his participation in part one, perhaps imagining that talking points might be the flotation device to get him through a cameo in some uncomfortable television. The famously on-message Cormann refused to confirm whether or not Turnbull had offered Dutton the deputy leadership in the melee despite being a primary witness to the conversation, and despite appearing on camera in a program where spilling your guts is the price of entry. But after that awkward I\u2019m-not-getting-into-that-David, the Cormann character was prised open a few degrees. The experience of being personally close to Turnbull and then becoming the most significant person in putting him to the sword in WTF week clearly wasn\u2019t easy. At one point Cormann noted it had been a \u201cdifficult week\u201d and he had been trying to make the right judgments. He did not betray Turnbull, he insisted, because he\u2019d tried to be straight with him throughout. There were flickers of some emotional range.</p> \n<h2>5. The Craig and Arthur show</h2> \n<p>Craig Laundy\u2019s role in the car crash has already been well canvassed, mostly by Laundy himself, who suffered a trauma and, not being an automaton, has needed to process it in a number of subsequent conversations \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/oct/25/craig-laundy-i-saw-the-worst-of-politics-i-had-a-ringside-seat\">including one with me last year</a>, which remains the most truthful on-the-record account I\u2019ve heard from a politician about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/17/in-the-fight-club-of-australian-politics-the-public-suffer-the-knockout-blow\">manifest inhumanity of contemporary political life</a>. Laundy, an outside recruit to politics, and Arthur Sinodinos, the ultimate political insider, piloted Turnbull to the end of his prime ministership on the Friday when Morrison emerged with the prize. Sinodinos explained that vigil for him was about loyalty \u2013 Turnbull had been loyal to him when it had counted, and generosity demanded reciprocity. Laundy was asked by Speers whether he was emotional at that moment of walking Turnbull to his political end. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t emotional in that moment, you weren\u2019t human,\u201d Laundy said, and the words hung in the air.</p>",

Turnbull was a dope who called a leadership spill early in the week (\u201cthe final act of misjudgment\u201d), underscoring his lack of political nous. Turnbull then offered Dutton the deputy Liberal leadership, which wasn\u2019t his gift to give. Turnbull was the mean bastard who wouldn\u2019t let Dutton just take the prime ministership from him without forcing the plotters to put their names to a petition. Turnbull seeking concrete evidence he\u2019d lost the support of the party room was just \u201ca stalling tactic to damage me\u201d and a sign he had reverted to \u201cmerchant banker mode\u201d (possibly that was the counting of names on a petition, it wasn\u2019t really clear). In any case, Pete\u2019s not sorry. He\u2019s a bit sorry he lost when Turnbull called on the death match by demanding that people put their name to their intrigue, in the process handing Morrison, and not Dutton, the prime ministership, thereby outflanking him at the critical juncture. Bit sorry about that. But that\u2019s just Malcolm, isn\u2019t it? An idiot. Obviously. Yeah. Um. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning 4. Mathias Cormann is \u2026 shook Just as Dutton\u2019s political character is fixed, seemingly devoid of surprises, the finance minister also opened his participation in part one, perhaps imagining that talking points might be the flotation device to get him through a cameo in some uncomfortable television. The famously on-message Cormann refused to confirm whether or not Turnbull had offered Dutton the deputy leadership in the melee despite being a primary witness to the conversation, and despite appearing on camera in a program where spilling your guts is the price of entry. But after that awkward I\u2019m-not-getting-into-that-David, the Cormann character was prised open a few degrees. The experience of being personally close to Turnbull and then becoming the most significant person in putting him to the sword in WTF week clearly wasn\u2019t easy. At one point Cormann noted it had been a \u201cdifficult week\u201d and he had been trying to make the right judgments. He did not betray Turnbull, he insisted, because he\u2019d tried to be straight with him throughout. There were flickers of some emotional range. 5. The Craig and Arthur show Craig Laundy\u2019s role in the car crash has already been well canvassed, mostly by Laundy himself, who suffered a trauma and, not being an automaton, has needed to process it in a number of subsequent conversations \u2013 including one with me last year, which remains the most truthful on-the-record account I\u2019ve heard from a politician about the manifest inhumanity of contemporary political life. Laundy, an outside recruit to politics, and Arthur Sinodinos, the ultimate political insider, piloted Turnbull to the end of his prime ministership on the Friday when Morrison emerged with the prize. Sinodinos explained that vigil for him was about loyalty \u2013 Turnbull had been loyal to him when it had counted, and generosity demanded reciprocity. Laundy was asked by Speers whether he was emotional at that moment of walking Turnbull to his political end. \u201cIf you weren\u2019t emotional in that moment, you weren\u2019t human,\u201d Laundy said, and the words hung in the air.",

Are Beninese squirrels considered to be particularly menacing?\u201d Funnily enough, at the beginning of these qualifiers the Beninese Football Federation said they were going to change the nickname and invited people to suggest a better one. Mouni\u00e9, for instance, proposed \u2018The Pythons\u201d because they have a huge place in Beninese culture. In the end, though, Benin decided to stick with the Squirrels. I asked Mr Mouni\u00e9 how they got it in the first place and he said that the version he was given was that back when the national team were first starting out and began thinking of a nickname, they went for a training session and there happened to be a load of squirrles sitting on the pitch. It was a sign. I\u2019m just glad that the team I used to play for didn\u2019t apply a similar policy, otherwise we would have been known as the Cowpats. <br></p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T20:55:45.384Z\">at 9.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d12884a8f082364d7cf13b4\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T20:48:57.250Z\">9.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Half-time: Ghana 2-1 Benin</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>After a sluggish start that vibrant Benin punished to the max, the Black Stars have stormed back in encouraging style.

If you want an idea of how much playing for Benin means to him, you could ask the pupils of South Crossland primary school in Huddersfield. When some of them were asked to do a project on Benin last year, they decided to write to Mouni\u00e9 and ask him for information. He replied with a lovely two-page letter full of warmth, sincerity and tips. He began: \u201cI\u2019ve read every single letter you wrote me. I was very proud to know that in England some kids are learning about my country. I was very glad and I would like to thank you to make me live this moment with you.\u201d</p> <p> \u201cIn your letters you asked me some questions,\u201d he continued. \u201c To make it easy for me I will answer by telling you my life story and the history of my country and what it is like in the present day.\u201d He went to explain that he was born in the town of Parakou but moved to France with his parents when he was four years old (\u201cThe only thing I can remember [about his life in Benin before that] is the name of my primary school there, which was \u2018Hibiscus\u2019 \u2013 the name of a very beautiful red flower you can find in Benin.\u201d); he gave details about the Benin kingdom of yore (\u201cIn Benin we had some big kings \u2026 the best known of them was the King B\u00e9hanzin. He was king of Dahomey (present-day Benin) from 1890 to 1894. He was known because he fought against the coloniser and he fought with bravery and prevented Dahomey from being as colonised as other kingdoms.

As ever, the Black Stars arrive with high hopes and, given the quality in their ranks, there has been much talk of this being a prime opportunity for them to end their 37-year wait to regain the continental crowd that they have held four times. With Tomas Partey and Christian Atsu in a midfield that will aim to provide regular service to the Ayew brothers, Ghana have useful firepower. And if things don\u2019t click, they can call on Asamoah Gyan, who craves an opportunity to become the first man to score in no fewer than seven of these tournaments.</p> <p>Benin meanwhile, have not even appeared in that many Afcons (this is the fourth time they\u2019ve reached their continent\u2019s showpiece) and they have never won a match at it. That\u2019s a fact the Squirrels aim to change. They beat Algeria and Togo in the qualifiers so they\u2019re not to be under-estimated. If a defence led by Olivier Verdon can keep the Black Stars at bay, and if Steve Mouni\u00e9 is in form up front, then they have the capacity to spring surprise even without the suspended, St\u00e9phane Sessegnon. </p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "The spoils are shared after a gripping contest that both sides will feel they could have won. Ghana\u2019s chances of doing so were hampered by the extrmeley harsh dismissal of John Boye in the second half, after which Benin drew level and created chances to claim their first ever win in the tournament. In the end, though, they have to make do with a draw, which is more than they were expected to get before kickoff. Both countries will fanacy their chances of progressing. The Squirrels are on the march! And the Black Stars showed enough quality going forward to suggest they are contenders for outright glory, although their defence will have to shape up a lot. 90+2 min: Dossou sends over a delightful cross from the right. Mounie times his run to perfection an sends a poewrful header ... over the bar from seven yards! 90 min: Mouni\u00e9 booked for reasons that are not apparent. Ghana substitution: Acquah on, Andrew Ayew off. Ghana will take a point. 88 min: Djigla romps down the left again, then picks outAdeoiti, who feeds Pote at the edge of the box. Ghana converge on him quickly enough to prevent him from getting off a shot, so he recycles it . And the move ends with the ball being ballooned over the bar from miles out. 87 min: Benin work Digla into space down the left. Ghana reple his cross. But Benin regain it and put the pressure right back on. They want a winner against the 10 men... 85 min: Digla\u2019s putting himself about to great effect up front, seriously perturbing the Ghanaian defence. 83 min: Djigla\u2019s first touch is a reasonable shot from 20 yards, though it would have taken awfully negligent goalkeeping to reach the net. Benin substitution: Djigla on, Soukou off. 80 min: Wakaso is shoved to the ground in the centre circle after skipping past Mama. He gets the freekick but angrily asks the ref why no card has been shown, counting out the number of times he has been fouled like that. True enough, the ref has been o model of inconsistency, pernickety enough to send off Boye for not taking a freekick quickly enough but lenient enough to allow serial foulers to escape bookings. 78 min: Dossou slams into Yiadom by the right-hand touchline, practically demanding to have a freekick given against him. It\u2019s delivered towards the back post, but Benin clear without ado. 76 min: Wakaso wins possession with terrific tackle in midfield. But then Ghana give it away, and Adams earns a booking for pulling down Mouni\u00e9 as the Huddersfield striker threatened to run away from him. 74 min: With his teammates waiting in the middle for a precise delivery, Partey bungles a freekick, scooping it high and wide. 73 min: Adenon whacks the ball to safety as Atsu tried to connect with a nice flipped pass oer the top of the Beninese defence. Ghana are coming on strong here, making light of their numerical deficit. 71 min: Wow! Partey lets fly with a rocket of a freekick from way out - 25 yards and over to the left - and Farnolle has to fling himself across goal to make a fine save. He then berates his defenders for not erecting a wall but perhaps if they had doen so, the keeper would not have had such a good view of the incoming ball. 69 min: Dossou makes good ground down the left and then goes for goal from 20 yards. But it bobbled just before he struck and, as a result, took off towards the sky. 67 min: Wonderful, skillful play by Ghana! Nifty passing and moving in the box before Andre Ayew is thwarted by a heroic last-gasp tackle. 66 min: A long throw-in from the right bounces around the Benin box before Atsu gets it under control and tries to bang it goalward with a spectacular overhead kick. A fine effort, but just wide! The Squirrels are level! They caught out Ghana with a short corner and then drove a low cross into the box. Pot\u00e9 turned it goalwards from six yards and wheeled away in celebration. Now, can Benin go on and get their first ever victory in the Africa Cup of Nations? Or can Ghana\u2019s 10-men fight back? 63 min: Soukou curls a sweet freekick over the wall, and Ofori punches away for a corner. Benin substitutions: Mama and Dossou on, Adilehou and D\u2019Almeida off. Benin are going for it! 61 min: Wakaso can\u2019t believe he\u2019s punished for brining down Mouni\u00e9, but he is. Benin have a freekick in a dangerous position, about 23 yards out, a little to the left of the D. Ghana substitution: Mensah on, Owusu off. So the first-half substitute is hauled back off because Ghana have to adjust to the loss of Boye. 58 min: Ghana cut through down the right flank with a sharp one-two between Yiadom and Owusu, but then Yiadom\u2019s control lets him down and the ball runs out of play. 58 min: Now, can Benin make the extra man pay. Will Dussuyer make a tactical switch to try to get more support up to the forlorn Mouni\u00e9? Boye is shown a second yellow card for time-wasting. It\u2019s an absurd decision! He was shaping up to take a freekick from inside his own half and then got a shout from his goalkeeper to leave it, so he jogged forward to let the keeper take it. But the ref reckoned they were up to trickery so strode forward and issued a second booking! That punishment sure didn\u2019t fit the so-called crime. The ball was dead, th ref could easily add on the few seconds he thought were being wasted. 52 min: Mouni\u00e9 gets up well to nod down a cross from the right to Pot\u00e9 near the penalty spot. Boye makes an important block. Good pressure from the Squirrels though ... 50 min: Baraz\u00e9 lumps over a freekick from the right. Pot\u00e9, making regular bursts from midfield, has managed to get on the end of most deliveries and this stime is no exception. But his header from 18 yards sails over. 48 min: Andrew Ayew is up on his feet and trying to run off his ankle pain. Let\u2019s hope he succeeds because he\u2019s played very well so far, on top of scoring Ghana\u2019s first goal. And he seems to have an uncanny understanding with Ghana\u2019s central striker... 47 min: D\u2019Almeida is shown a deserved yellow card for pulling down Partey before falling awkwardly on to the ankle of Andre Ayew, who seems to be in a lot of pain. Ghana\u2019s players look concerned. 46 min: No changes during the break. Can Benin start the second half as powerfully as they began the first? \u201cThe Squirrels has to be the best nickname in international football,\u201d cheers Oliver Sampson. \u201cWhat inspired them to choose that? Are Beninese squirrels considered to be particularly menacing?\u201d Funnily enough, at the beginning of these qualifiers the Beninese Football Federation said they were going to change the nickname and invited people to suggest a better one. Mouni\u00e9, for instance, proposed \u2018The Pythons\u201d because they have a huge place in Beninese culture. In the end, though, Benin decided to stick with the Squirrels. I asked Mr Mouni\u00e9 how they got it in the first place and he said that the version he was given was that back when the national team were first starting out and began thinking of a nickname, they went for a training session and there happened to be a load of squirrles sitting on the pitch. It was a sign. I\u2019m just glad that the team I used to play for didn\u2019t apply a similar policy, otherwise we would have been known as the Cowpats. After a sluggish start that vibrant Benin punished to the max, the Black Stars have stormed back in encouraging style. They deserve their lead but have plenty of work to do yet because Benin have shown they can be dangerous. It\u2019s been an intense an highy entertaining game so far. More please! 43 min: Adams blocks an Adeoti run with the most blatant bodycheck you\u2019ll ever see. He escapes a booking and, even better, Benin waste the freekick. 41 min: Adams fizzes a low pass from the halfway to Jordan Ayew, who spins past the slightly perplexed Verdon and then rams the ball into the top corner with his right foot from 18 yards. What a stonking finish by Jordan Ayew! 40 min: Owusu tires to make an immediate impact. Receiving the ball wide on the left, he accelerates in midfield and an unloads a reasonable drive. It whistles wide. 39 min: Agbenyenu is forced into the concession of a corner. Ghana have not defended these well so far. But Andrew Ayew does the business this tsime, nutting it to safety at the near post. 37 min: Boye overruns the ball in midfield and then lunges at it in desperation and ends up clonking D\u2019Almeida. He cops the inevitable yellow card. Ghana substitution: Owusu on, Ageypong off, at last. 34 min: Mouni\u00e9 is upended in midfield by Agyepong, who may have resorted to that just to make play stop so he can be replaced. But Benin take a quick freekick and on he must go. 32 min: Ghana are enjoying the lion\u2019s share of possession now, and Benin have filed back into a 5-4-1 in which Mounie is very isolated up front. A feeling he is sadly accustomed to. Meanwhile, Ghana still haven\u2019t made their substitution. It\u2019s not clear why, because Owusu is ready to come on and Agyepong seems ready to come off. 30 min: Agyepong seems to be in pain. He signals to the bench, seemingly asking to be replaced. Owusu is stripped and ready but for some reason play is allowed to continue. 28 min: Andre Ayew skedaddles into the left-hand side of the box and tries to pick out his brother in the middle, but Adilehou won\u2019t allow it. 25 min: Adeoti spreads the play with a well-flighted ball to the right, Pot\u00e9 takes it down deftly but then sends his cross too close to the keeper. 24 min: A snappy bit of interplay by Ghana takes them from one side of the pitch to the other and then to the brink of the BEnin box, whereupon it breaks down. Still, an encouraging bit of action for the Black Stars, who are piecing together some zippy moves. 22 min: Soukou\u2019s corner is allowed to run right across the edge of the six-yard box. Ghana are very lucky that no attack can get a touch, because their defender seemed oddly nonplussed. They\u2019ve looked very shaky at the back so far. 20 min: Soukou delivers a dangerous freekick from the left. Boye leaps high to nod out for a corner under pressure. 19 min: Imoru bangs over a dangerous cross from the left. Pot\u00e9 meets it with a volley from 15 yards. His connection isn\u2019t quite right, and that allows the keeper to make a save. 17 min: Lovely work by Atsu after receiving a short corner. He dropped his shoulder and zoomed past the full-back in the manner of a motorcylist taking a corner (or a bit like Eden Hazard, if you prefer), and then delivered a useful cross. Benin dealt with it well. 15 min: Atsu burts into the box and goes down in the vicinity of a tackle by Imoru, who made no contact with him whatsoever. The referee stares at the attacker in a way as if daring him to try to claim a penalty. Wisely, Atsu doesn\u2019t. 14 min: Agyepong careers down the left wing before winning a corner. It\u2019s flicked on at the near post ... and hits the referee! Benin\u2019s grateful defence smack it clear. 13 min: Partey tries to dink a ball over the top of the Beninese defence for Jordan Ayew to chase. But he sends it too long. 12 min: This has been a cracking contest so far, played with more intensity than any other in the tournament so far (and it has been a good tournament so far). Benin\u2019s bold start challenged Ghana to show their quality and they\u2019re rising to that challenge. From their first attack the Black Stars draw level! Benin will be miffed at how easily Jordan Ayew was allowed to latch on to a simple ball over the top by Adams. Then the forward pulled the ball back to his brother, who sized up a defender before shuffling quickly to his left and firing a low shot beyond the keeper from 15 yards, courtesy of an important deflection. 7 min: Ghana are trying to compose themelves by hogging possession but Benin are making it difficult. They\u2019re playing with real intensity. 4 min: Partey has the shirt almsot literally torn off his back by Mouni\u00e9 as the striker tries to win the ball back in midfield. It wasn\u2019t particularly violent - those shirtsmsut be very flimsy - and it shows how determined Benin are to hold on to their lead. Indeed, the way they\u2019ve startaed they might increase it ... Ghana are in lots of bother here. What a start for the migthy Squirrels! They tore into their illustrious opponents from the beginning and have instant reward! Pot\u00e9 hared on to a clever through ball from midfield, racing past the high Ghanain defence. Agbenyenu seemed to have recovered sufficiently to stop him but Pot\u00e9 turned inside the defender and fired below the advancing keeper! 1 min: We have kickoff! The Black Stars get this party started. The smattering of fans who have turned up in the Ismaila stadium are supporting their countries with festive fervour. \u201cValiant Squirrels, make us dream!\u201d exhorts one banner among the Benin faithful. Steve Mouni\u00e9 may not have had an especially happy season with Huddersfield last term \u2013 after a fine first one \u2013 but he has been in strong recent form for his country and has spoken to the Guardian of his eagerness to create history with them here. If you want an idea of how much playing for Benin means to him, you could ask the pupils of South Crossland primary school in Huddersfield. When some of them were asked to do a project on Benin last year, they decided to write to Mouni\u00e9 and ask him for information. He replied with a lovely two-page letter full of warmth, sincerity and tips. He began: \u201cI\u2019ve read every single letter you wrote me. I was very proud to know that in England some kids are learning about my country. I was very glad and I would like to thank you to make me live this moment with you.\u201d \u201cIn your letters you asked me some questions,\u201d he continued. \u201c To make it easy for me I will answer by telling you my life story and the history of my country and what it is like in the present day.\u201d He went to explain that he was born in the town of Parakou but moved to France with his parents when he was four years old (\u201cThe only thing I can remember [about his life in Benin before that] is the name of my primary school there, which was \u2018Hibiscus\u2019 \u2013 the name of a very beautiful red flower you can find in Benin.\u201d); he gave details about the Benin kingdom of yore (\u201cIn Benin we had some big kings \u2026 the best known of them was the King B\u00e9hanzin. He was king of Dahomey (present-day Benin) from 1890 to 1894. He was known because he fought against the coloniser and he fought with bravery and prevented Dahomey from being as colonised as other kingdoms. Unfortunately in 1892 he lost against France and from that France looted some royal artefacts. Those are artefacts are now in the \u2018Quai Branly\u2019 museum in Paris. Some of the artefacts you have learned about have been looted by England as well and they are actually in the British museum in London.\u201d). He concluded by thanking the children again for their interest, wishing them the best in their futures \u201cI hope you find a passion that you can make a job\u201d) and that they get to visit Benin one day (\u201cIt\u2019s a very amazing place to visit and I hope some of you will be able to go once in your life\u201d). The children loved his reply. Ghana: Ofori; Yiadom, Agbeyenu, Boye, Adams; Wakaso, Partey , Agyepong, Atsu; A Ayew, J Ayew Benin: Farnolle; Baraze, Adilehou, Adenon, Verdon, Imorou; Pot\u00e9, D\u2019Almeida, Adeoti, Soukou; Mouni\u00e9 Hello and welcome the long-awaited appearances in Afcon 2019 of Ghana and Benin.

You have to feel desperately sorry for her. In the current climate, it was a penalty kick: her arm was in an unnatural position, it stopped Miedema\u2019s shot, and you know how the refs roll these days. But she was pretty close to Miedema, and a second look suggests she was trying to withdraw her arm as the ball hit it anyway. The law is an ass. It\u2019s such an awful break for Kumagai and Japan, who were by far the better side tonight.

Tonight\u2019s rumble in Rennes concludes the first knockout stage, and pits the reigning European champions against the current champs of Asia.

By contrast, the Dutch will prefer to deal in the here and now: they won all three of their group games while Japan\u2019s performance in France has been average to date, having won just one game in Group D. But then Japan lost to England in the groups in 2011 as well, and look what happened there.</p> <p><strong>If Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema has her eye in tonight, the Dutch could be hard to stop. </strong>The Netherlands go into the match as favourites. On the other hand, Saki Kumagai, Japan\u2019s hero in 2011 and one of the stars of all-conquering Lyon, could quite easily wrest control of a game that looks deliciously poised.

      "bodyText": "Congratulations to the Netherlands, the seventh European side to reach the quarter-finals. They\u2019ll play Italy in Valenciennes on Saturday afternoon. Commiserations to Japan, who passed the ball around quite deliciously tonight and will wonder how they let that one slip. All that\u2019s left is to point you in the direction of Suzanne Wrack\u2019s match report. Enjoy, enjoy. Thanks for reading. Nighty night! Poor Saki Kumagai is in floods of tears. She\u2019s being consoled by Shanice van de Sanden and Sari van Veenendaal, but neither Dutch player can stem the tide. You have to feel desperately sorry for her. In the current climate, it was a penalty kick: her arm was in an unnatural position, it stopped Miedema\u2019s shot, and you know how the refs roll these days. But she was pretty close to Miedema, and a second look suggests she was trying to withdraw her arm as the ball hit it anyway. The law is an ass. It\u2019s such an awful break for Kumagai and Japan, who were by far the better side tonight. Then again, the Netherlands dug deep, held their nerve, rode their luck, and carved out that chance right at the end thanks to Lineth Beerensteyn\u2019s mazy dribble. Having dodged a bullet tonight, they might begin to wonder if this is their year. What a dramatic finish to the game of the tournament so far! The Dutch make it to the quarters! They celebrate like they can\u2019t quite believe it, having weathered one hell of a storm and won a late penalty. Japan certainly can\u2019t believe it: they look stunned at the brutal end to their World Cup dream. What a football match that was! 90 min +4: Takarada launches long into a packed Dutch box. Van Veenendaal comes off her line to punch confidently clear. Momiki tries to make space for a shot but is closed down. It looks all over for Japan. 90 min +3: Japan have swapped Iwabuchi for Takarada, by the way. 90 min +2: A huge scramble in the Dutch box! Kumagai and Sugasawa try to force it home from the middle of a melee. Think a cartoon cloud with boots and fists sticking out of it. But they can\u2019t get a shot away, and inevitably the referee blows for a mild infringement in favour of the defending team. 90 min +1: There will be five added minutes. Can Japan save themselves? How they\u2019ll rue all those missed chances. No luck either, of course. But they win a corner on the left. This isn\u2019t over yet! Martens sends Yamashita the wrong way, and rolls the ball into the bottom right. So clinical. So unfortunate for Japan, who have been by far the better side. 89 min: There\u2019s a VAR check first, of course. But it\u2019s going to be given. Adding insult to injury, Kumagai is booked. 88 min: Beerensteyn dribbles in from the right. She causes much panic. The ball ends up at the feet of Miedema, who smashes a first-time shot goalwards. It hits Kumagai\u2019s right arm, which is hung out by her side. That\u2019s a nailed-on penalty. 87 min: Roord replaces - a surprise, this - Van de Donk, who has been Holland\u2019s best player tonight. 86 min: Van Es comes on for Van Dongen. 85 min: Iwabuchi, to the left of the Dutch D, exchanges passes with Sugasawa before launching high over the bar. Japan are creating plenty of chances. A mixture of bad luck and bad finishing means they\u2019ve yet to find what would surely be the winner. 84 min: Of course, the Dutch could still nick this as well. Miedema nearly makes space for a shot on the edge of the Japanese box. Then Beerensteyn twists and turns down the right, making enough space for a shot from a tight angle. Yamashita smothers. 82 min: Japan come again. Again. Momiki, who has been outstanding since coming on, draws a defender and slips Miura clear on the right. She\u2019s one on one with the keeper but leans back and blazes over. This is a quite sensational passage of play by Japan ... but can they make it count? 80 min: The Dutch are seriously rocking here. There\u2019s some pinball in their box. Japan are aware of what\u2019s going on. Holland are not. The ball breaks to Momiki on the penalty spot. She shoots for the bottom right. Van Veenendaal turns it clear at full stretch! Corner ... which comes to nothing. 79 min: Sugasawa slips Sugita clear down the right. Sugita looks to have taken far too long to shoot. She\u2019s closed down. But then she cuts inside and launches a shot that beats Van Veenendaal, heading towards the top left. But it crashes the underside of the bar, down, out and away! So unlucky! 78 min: Beerensteyn barrels down the right and earns a corner. Miedema meets the set piece with her head, but not altogether convincingly. Japan clear. This is such a good game. Goodness knows who\u2019ll win this. 76 min: Now Momiki, playmaking from deep, releases Iwabuchi with a fine wedge down the inside-right channel. Iwabuchi enters the box and should pull back for Sugasawa in the centre, but blasts into the side netting instead. What a waste! 74 min: Martens crosses high from the left. Japan struggle to clear. Groenen takes the ball down and shoots from the edge of the box. It\u2019s blocked. Japan go straight up the other end. Momiki sprays a glorious right-to-left crossfield pass to release Sugasawa into the box! But Sugasawa dithers and allows Van der Gragt to come back and block. And she\u2019s offside anyway. 73 min: Japan make their first change, withdrawing Nakajima and sending on Momiki. 71 min: Japan nearly score another sensational team goal. A few passes pinged down the inside-left channel. Suddenly Iwabuchi is in the area, her back to goal. She clips a clever backheel inside to Hasegawa, who opens her body and whips a low curler towards the bottom right. It\u2019s inches wide, with the keeper beaten. Japan are so good to watch when it all clicks. 69 min: Ah good news: the pain subsides quickly and Groenen is good to continue. It really did look a sore one. Meanwhile the Dutch make their first sub of the evening, replacing Van de Sanden with Beerensteyn. 67 min: Groenen is down, and she\u2019s hurt. Miura slid in, a fair challenge to get the ball, but she then accidentally clattered into Groenen\u2019s standing leg. Her ankle bent in worrying fashion. 65 min: Miedema busies herself bothering the Japanese defenders. Her hard work nearly springs Van de Donk into the box, where she\u2019d be one on one with Yamashita. But there\u2019s a rare technical failure, as the ball runs under her foot, and the brief window of opportunity slams shut. 63 min: Nakajima styles in from the right and sends a pearler towards the bottom left from 20 yards. It\u2019s heading in, but Van Veenendaal extends herself to parry it clear. Sensational play all round. Both teams are really going for this. A very entertaining game. 62 min: A ball falls from great height. Van de Donk stuns it dead. What a touch. She spins and floats off down the left, before crossing deep for Van de Sanden, who sends a weak header straight into the arms of Yamashita. Van de Donk is such a gifted player. 61 min: Something of a lull. It\u2019s almost as if both teams are keeping a little back in case this goes to extra time. 59 min: Japan are slowly beginning to find their passing game again. Good luck calling which way this is going to go. Meanwhile reports of the death of the Great Dutch Songbook have been wildly exaggerated. \u201cThe Dutch brass band (named Kleintje Pils, literally something akin to little glass of beer) might have played the melody of Auld Lang Syne, but the text isn\u2019t the same,\u201d explains Lena. \u201cIt\u2019s a Dutch football song with lyrics \u2018Wij houden van Oranje\u2019 (we love Orange).\u201d I wonder if there\u2019s a version of Oei Oei Oei (Dat Was Me Weer Een Loei) in Lowland Scots? 57 min: Japan have been quiet since the restart, but Iwabuchi shifts the ball in from the left, then Sugita shuttles it further inside to Sugasawa, who leans back and hoicks a shot over the bar from the edge of the box. A reminder for Holland that Japan are well capable of soaking up pressure only to spring forward quicksmart. 55 min: Both teams just probing at the minute. More of it goes on in the Japanese half, but not to any great effect. 53 min: Van de Donk nearly latches onto a long pass down the inside right but Yamashita comes to the edge of her box to claim. The Dutch appear to be refreshed after the half-time break. 51 min: Japan don\u2019t half like playing out from the back. Yamashita has nerves of steel. She\u2019s very nearly closed down again, this time by Van de Donk, on her own goal-line. But she simply drops a shoulder to change direction as her opponent races in, and flicks the ball away from danger with a perfect pass to Shimizu. That was outrageous. On her own goal-line! 49 min: Spitse is clattered from behind by Iwabuchi, 25 yards from the Japanese goal. Spitse gets up and takes the free kick herself, whipping one around the wall and down towards the bottom left. Yamashita sees it late, and does extremely well to smother. 47 min: Van de Sanden powers down the right and whips a cross into the mixer. She\u2019s got the beating of Sameshima. But her cross is too near Yamashita, who can flick the ball away from Miedema, and from danger. \u201cMatt Phillips (12 mins) is, indeed, still struggling with his Dutch,\u201d tut-tuts Wim Roefs. \u201c\u2018Kop\u2019 does mean \u2018cup\u2019 but it also means \u2018head\u2019. It\u2019s a less distinguished term for head when used to indicate a human head, in which case the more distinguished word is \u2018hoofd\u2019. But it\u2019s not offensive to say \u2018kop\u2019 in that case, as in the perfectly fine \u2018kaaskop\u2019, where the use \u2018kop\u2019 actually adds a measure of fierceness that would be lacking if you were to say \u2018kaashoofd\u2019. No one says the latter. \u2018Kop\u2019 is often use for animals, such as in \u2018paardekop\u2019, which is \u2018horse head\u2019.\u201d And we\u2019re off again! The Dutch get the ball rolling again and launch it long. Goal kick. \u201cThis has been fantastic football,\u201d says Mary Waltz. \u201cI have no clue who will end up on top and that is what makes this game exciting.\u201d Half-time reading. The winners of this match will play Italy in the quarter-finals. Kieran Pender was at the Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier to see Milena Bertolini\u2019s side breeze past China. Nothing of note happens in the time added onto the first half. The Netherlands needed to hear the whistle, because after a powerful start, Japan got stronger and stronger before scoring one of the goals of the tournament. It\u2019s been a fine match. More, please! \u201cThe Netherlands look tired after chasing the ball so much and trying to keep it,\u201d observes Ruth Purdue. \u201cJapan\u2019s style is a joy to watch, if a little brave a times. Bring on the second half.\u201d 45 min: There will be three added minutes. The Dutch look rattled ... but that goal had been coming, Japan slowly working their way into the match as they imposed their passing game. 44 min: Miedema has been quiet ... and she nearly restores Holland\u2019s lead immediately! She works her way into the box from the right, rides a couple of challenges, then slams a shot straight at Yamashita. Either side of the keeper and the European champions were ahead again. This is a sensational goal! Sugita sashays in from the left. She lays off to Sugasawa, on the edge of the box, her back to goal. Sugasawa immediately cushions a pass for Iwabuchi, who shrugs off Groenen, draws Van der Gragt, then dinks a cheeky pass forward to Hasegawa, suddenly inside the area in acres of freshly created space! Hasegawa gently wedges the ball over Van Veenendaal and into the top right! As calm as you like. A stunning finish, a stunning team goal. 41 min: Sugasawa goes sliding in on Van Lunteren and nearly makes very illegal contact. That was a wild swipe. But she doesn\u2019t connect, and play goes on. Van Lunteren isn\u2019t that happy about it, though, gesticulating at the referee afterwards. 39 min: The Dutch put on a possession showcase of their own. It\u2019s all in the middle of the park right now. 37 min: Japan\u2019s pass-and-move style is beginning to cause the Dutch some concern. But this is a fascinating battle of styles, because Holland look dangerous whenever they launch one of their fast, thrusting attacks. 35 min: A couple of neat Japanese passing moves. But the passes in the final third aren\u2019t sticking right now. When they\u2019re in full flow, though, it\u2019s really good to watch. 33 min: The energy levels have dipped. Van de Sanden tries to get something going with a burst down the right but Sameshima shepherds the ball out of play. 31 min: The trumpeters are playing Auld Lang Syne. What a searing indictment of the Great Dutch Songbook. 29 min: Ichise slides in on Van de Sanden. It\u2019s a clean tackle, though she\u2019s landed awkwardly on her left arm, bending it back as she fell. For a second it looks really serious, but happily it looks like a short sting of pain rather than anything serious, because after a little treatment, she\u2019s good to go again. 27 min: Japan are beginning to lose control again. Miedema, dropping deep, nearly pings Van de Sanden clear down the inside right. Van de Sanden\u2019s got the beating of the Japanese back line, but Yamashita rushes out of her area to belt clear. That was a good read, one that got her team out of trouble. 26 min: Bloodworth nearly releases Martens down the inside-left channel with a long pass, but there\u2019s a little too much pace on it. Meanwhile the Dutch fans are in full party mode, a pair of trumpeters giving it plenty. You\u2019d hope they\u2019ll play this one later: 24 min: Room for Van De Sanden out on the right. She considers trying to zip past Sameshima on the outside, but hits a first-time cross instead. It\u2019s wayward and cleared. Maybe she\u2019ll go on a dribble next time. 22 min: Japan have responded well to conceding the opening goal. Sugasawa\u2019s near miss aside, they\u2019ve held onto the ball better and are playing further up the pitch. \u201cSo, the Dutch are the original cheese-heads, not Wisconsonians?\u201d wonders Rob Coughlin aloud. \u201cHuh, I thought if it were from Europe, it would be the Swiss. Also, Wisconsin was mainly settled by the Germans. Cheese is weird.\u201d 20 min: Japan finally wake up, and how! Some patient possession. Then suddenly they spring Sugasawa into the box! She opens her body and curls a shot towards the bottom right. Van Veenendaal is beaten, but the ball twangs off the outside of the post and out for a goal kick. So unlucky! In a parallel universe somewhere, Sugasawa blocks Martens\u2019 flick then goes up the other end to score. It\u2019s a thin line between success and failure in top-level sport. 18 min: That was a huge break for the Dutch, though the cuteness of the backflick earned that luck. It was a lovely touch by Martens. The Netherlands aren\u2019t flattered by this lead. The corner from the left drops at the feet of Martens, on the six-yard line. She back-flicks towards the goal. The ball breaks off Sugasawa, desperately spreading herself to block, and squeaks into the bottom right. Yamashita had no chance of changing direction. 16 min: Martens is yet again sent free down the left. Her dinked cross finds Miedema, whose header is uncharacteristically weak. The ball breaks back to Van De Donk, who shoots. The ball breaks off Ichise and out for a corner. Holland want a penalty, but they\u2019re quite rightly not getting one. No matter, though, because from the corner ... 14 min: Van Dongen jumps into Nakajima and there\u2019s a clash of heads. Nakajima requires a bit of attention. She\u2019s taken a sore one on the cheek. It looks like an accidental collision, though VAR has to poke its virtual neb in, and there\u2019s a brief pause while there\u2019s a check. All clear, though we never doubted it. 12 min: The Dutch are first to everything right now. Japan can\u2019t get out of their half. Meanwhile some corrections and clarifications with Matt Phillips: \u201cI\u2019m a Brit living in the Netherlands, and in Dutch, cheese head is actually kaaskop - kaas meaning cheese, and kop meaning cup, but in this situation it actually means head. It\u2019s a complex language, that I\u2019m still struggling with after ten years. Matt, from Holland/Netherlands.\u201d 10 min: Martens speeds down the left yet again. This time she very nearly finds Van de Sanden with her cross, though the flag goes up for offside. No wonder she was in so much space ... that time. But no doubt she\u2019ll be finding some more soon, and legally. She\u2019s lightning quick. 9 min: Martens looks extremely dangerous every time she probes down the left. She nearly breaks clear again but can\u2019t find enough space and time to measure a cross. It\u2019s going to be a busy evening for the Japan left-back Shimizu. 8 min: The Dutch slowly take the upper hand in these opening exchanges. Japan are struggling to keep possession right now. When they do get the ball, Sugita passes it harmlessly to nobody, and out of play. 6 min: The corner is a non-event, as corners so often are. Anyway, that was a fine move by the Dutch, although it would have been a very fortunate goal in the end. 5 min: Martens bowls down the left. Van de Sanden runs towards the near post, dragging both central defenders with her. Martens crosses long, Miedema rushing into the space created by Van de Sanden. She attempts to pass the ball into the left corner, but it takes a deflection off Ichise and nearly flies into the top right. Yamashita was beaten all ends up, wrong-footed, but the ball shaves the outside of the post and goes out for a corner. 4 min: Yamashita, the ball at her feet, takes an age to clear. The keeper\u2019s very nearly closed down by Martens. But she flicks the ball away to Shimizu just in time, whereupon Japan play some pretty triangles upfield to get themselves out of bother in style. 2 min: Both sides look fresh and bright. The Dutch forwards piled forward in the all-angles manner for the first 90 seconds or so; then Japan showcased some crisp tiki-taka in the middle of the park. It augurs well. And we\u2019re off! Japan get the ball rolling amid a fevered World Cup atmosphere. They soon give up possession, and Van de Sanden races down the right. Fortunately for Japan, who were light at the back, her cross is nowhere near Miedema and the ball is cleared. The teams are out! The Dutch line up in their trademark oranje, while Japan sport their first-choice blue. The Japanese had a scare during the warm-up, when reserve defender Shiori Miyake took a smack in the face from a ball, and had to be assisted from the field. But she\u2019s good to take her place on the bench. We\u2019ll be off in a minute! Netherlands nomenclature update. This courtesy of Andrew Williams. \u201cThe Dutch are sometimes known - colloquially - as K\u00e4sk\u00f6ppe (Cheeseheads) which is rather appropriate given that picture currently gracing the top of your report.\u201d That snap will soon be replaced with some footballers, so to ensure this fan\u2019s efforts aren\u2019t lost forever to the ether, let\u2019s post her picture here too. Altogether now ... There\u2019s still a fair bit of time to while away before kick-off. So why not immerse yourself in the heartwarming story of Japan\u2019s 2011 World Cup win, wonderfully told by Nick Ames? Off you pop, we\u2019ll still be here for you when you get back. The Dutch make one change from the team sent out against Canada. Barcelona defender Stefanie van der Gragt, who hasn\u2019t played since injuring her knee in the opening game against New Zealand, replaces Anouk Dekker. Japan have had no injury worries. But they\u2019re yet to find their top gear, so make three changes to the side named against England: Yuika Sugasawa, Yui Hasegawa and Narumi Miura come in for Kumi Yokoyama, Jun Endo and Rikako Kobayashi. Netherlands: Van Veenendaal, Van Lunteren, van der Gragt, Bloodworth, van Dongen, Groenen, van de Donk, Spitse, van de Sanden, Miedema, Martens. Subs: Kop, Van Es, Dekker, Pelova, Renate Jansen, Kaagman, Ellen Jansen, Kerkdijk, Roord, Beerensteyn, van der Most, Geurts. Japan: Yamashita, Shimizu, Kumagai, Ichise, Samashima, Nakajima, Miura, Sugita, Hasegawa, Sugasawa, Iwabuchi. Subs: Ikeda, Utsugi, Sakaguchi, Kobayashi, Minami, Takarada, Momiki, Miyagawa, Endo, Yokoyama, Miyake, Hirao. Referee: Melissa Borjas (Honduras). Style guide. GEORGE: What is Holland? JERRY: What do you mean, \u2018what is it?\u2019 It\u2019s a country right next to Belgium. GEORGE: No, that\u2019s the Netherlands. JERRY: Holland is the Netherlands. GEORGE: Then who are the Dutch? According to the Guardian style guide, Holland \u201cshould not be used to mean the Netherlands (of which it is a region), with the exception of the Dutch football team, who are conventionally known as Holland.\u201d So there you have it. Please consider both names interchangeable for the purposes of this report. Hup Holland Hup! Has the round of 16 saved its best for last? You can certainly make the argument. Tonight\u2019s rumble in Rennes concludes the first knockout stage, and pits the reigning European champions against the current champs of Asia. Throw in the fact that Japan have reached the last two World Cup finals, winning the thing in 2011, and there\u2019s the debate practically settled: this is a summit meeting between two of world football\u2019s classiest acts. Japan will hope history is a sign. They\u2019ve won five of their last eight matches against the Netherlands, and knocked them out at this stage four years ago. By contrast, the Dutch will prefer to deal in the here and now: they won all three of their group games while Japan\u2019s performance in France has been average to date, having won just one game in Group D. But then Japan lost to England in the groups in 2011 as well, and look what happened there. If Arsenal\u2019s Vivianne Miedema has her eye in tonight, the Dutch could be hard to stop. The Netherlands go into the match as favourites. On the other hand, Saki Kumagai, Japan\u2019s hero in 2011 and one of the stars of all-conquering Lyon, could quite easily wrest control of a game that looks deliciously poised. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 8pm BST, 9pm local in Rennes.",

      "bodyText": "Cameroon, the five-times winners and current holders, put a pre-tournament pay dispute behind them to beat the rank outsiders Guinea-Bissau 2-0 in their opening match at the Africa Cup of Nations in Ismailia. The Indomitable Lions took more than an hour to break down stubborn resistance before Yaya Banana and the substitute St\u00e9phane Bahoken scored in a three-minute spell to give Clarence Seedorf\u2019s side a winning start in group F. Banana headed in at the far post from a corner in the 66th minute before Bahoken, just off the bench, reacted quickly to turn the ball in after a rebound. Cameroon\u2019s players refused to board their flight for Egypt due to a dispute over bonuses last Thursday, but they travelled the following day despite voicing their dissatisfaction. Further turmoil was to follow when they sent Joel Tagueu home after the forward was found by a team doctor to have a \u201cpotentially life-threatening\u201d heart defect. The holders dominated the first half but found it difficult to find a way past the Guinea-Bissau defence and were not helped by wayward finishing from Christian Bassogog. He fired wide after escaping the defence in the seventh minute and miscued spectacularly after Karl Toko pulled the ball back from the by-line to leave him with an open goal just after the half hour. In the second half Cameroon turned the screw, creating a host of chances, although they also survived a couple of scares. The goalkeeper Andr\u00e9 Onana kicked a clearance straight at Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Mendy but it rebounded wide and Guinea-Bissau, who made their debut at the tournament in Gabon two years ago, went close when Sori Man\u00e9\u2019s long-range shot was just over. The deadlock was finally broken when Guinea-Bissau\u2019s goalkeeper Jonas Mendes was caught in no-man\u2019s land at a corner and Banana headed in at the far post. The second quickly followed as Ambroise Oyongo\u2019s cross was headed away by Rudinilson Silva but bounced off Man\u00e9 and went straight to Bahoken, who turned it in from close range. Guinea-Bissau still had chances, with Piqueti Silva heading against a post before the end. In the group\u2019s late match, Benin\u2019s Micka\u00ebl Pot\u00e9 pegged back Ghana to a surprise 2-2 draw. Ghana were shocked in the 55th minute when the defender John Boye, already booked, stepped up to take a free kick inside his own half, moved away to let a teammate take it instead, and was shown a second yellow card for time-wasting. Pot\u00e9 had opened the scoring in the second minute before Andr\u00e9 Ayew, currently on loan at Fenerbahce from Swansea City, equalised in the 10th minute. Jordan Ayew, his brother, made the score 2-1 three minutes before half-time.",

It\u2019s to the point where I don\u2019t use the Google Assistant, because I know how it\u2019s made, and I can\u2019t support it.\u201d</p> <h2>An \u2018army\u2019 of linguists</h2> <p>The study of language is at the very heart of current advancements in computing. For decades, people have had to work to learn the language of computers, whether they were trying to program a VCR or writing software. Technology such as the Google Assistant reverses the equation: the computer understands natural human speech, in all its variations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb5a3080a7ebbe00fbaf69a419db8b39712da335\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb5a3080a7ebbe00fbaf69a419db8b39712da335/225_323_4513_2709/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Behind the technology that makes the Google Assistant work is an army of Google-contracted linguists.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Behind the technology that makes the Google Assistant work is an army of Google-contracted linguists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Take, for example, the straightforward task of asking the Assistant to set a timer to go off in five minutes, a former employee on Pygmalion explained. There are infinite ways that users could phrase that request, such as \u201cSet a timer for five minutes\u201d; \u201cCan you ring the buzzer in five minutes?\u201d; or \u201cConfigurar una alarma para cinco minutos.\u201d The Assistant has to be able to convert the spoken request into text, then interpret the user\u2019s intended meaning to produce the desired outcome, all practically instantaneously.</p> <p>The technology that makes this possible is a form of machine learning. For a machine learning model to \u201cunderstand\u201d a language, it needs vast amounts of text that has been annotated by linguists to teach it the building blocks of human language, from parts of speech to syntactic relationships.</p> <p>Enter Pygmalion. The team was born in 2014, the brainchild of the longtime Google executive Linne Ha, to create the linguistic data sets required for Google\u2019s neural networks to learn dozens of languages. The \u201cpainstaking\u201d nature of the labor required to create this \u201chandcrafted\u201d data was featured in a 2016 article about Pygmalion\u2019s \u201cmassive team of PhD linguists\u201d by <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/11/googles-search-engine-can-now-answer-questions-human-help/\">Wired</a>. </p> <p>From the beginning, Google planned to build the team with just a handful of full-time employees while outsourcing the vast majority of the annotation work to an \u201carmy\u201d of subcontracted linguists around the world, documents reviewed by the Guardian and interviews with staff show.</p> <p>The appetite for Pygmalion\u2019s hand-labeled data, and the size of the team, has only increased over the years. Today, it includes 40 to 50 full-time Googlers and approximately 200 temporary workers contracted through agencies, including Adecco, a global staffing firm. The contract workers include associate linguists, who are tasked with annotation, and project managers, who oversee their work.</p> <p>All of the contract workers have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in linguistics, though many have master\u2019s degrees and some have doctorates. In addition to annotating data, the temp workers write \u201cgrammars\u201d for the Assistant, complex and technical work that requires considerable expertise and involves Google\u2019s code base. Their situation is comparable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/28/adjunct-professors-homeless-sex-work-academia-poverty\">adjunct professors</a> on US college campuses: they are highly educated and highly skilled, performing work crucial to the company\u2019s mission, and shut out of the benefits and security that come with a tenured position.</p> <p>\u201cImagine going from producing PhD-level research and pushing forward the state of knowledge in the world to going to an annotation type job, where all you\u2019re doing all day is annotating data; it\u2019s very click, click, click,\u201d said a former project manager on Pygmalion. \u201cEveryone was trying to prove themselves because everyone was trying to work for Google. The competitive edge that happened among colleagues as TVCs was severe.\u201d</p> <p>In comments provided to the Guardian after publication, Ha said: \u201cThe quantity of hours would not have been relevant to being converted to a full-time role.\u201d She said that skills, education and expertise were the most important factors for potential hires, and that Google\u2019s challenging interview process is well known.</p> <p>\u201cI have preached that work/life balance is critical for life satisfaction and general well being,\u201d she said. \u201cI have said again and again that we are NOT saving lives, our work is not critical enough to be killing ourselves for our job.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cGoogle is a multibillion-dollar company,\u201d she added. \u201cI would NEVER ask for people to work and be unpaid. This goes against everything that I believe.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The definition of wage theft\u2019</h2> <p>This dynamic created the incentive for temps to perform unpaid work. Managers took advantage by making it clear they wouldn\u2019t approve overtime for contract workers, while also assigning unrealistic amounts of work, current and former employees said.</p> <p>The pressure to complete assignments was \u201cimmense\u201d, said one Googler. \u201cIn this mixed stream of messages, I think a lot of people had to make their own calls, and given the pressure, I think people made different calls.\u201d</p> <p>The Googler described the overall effect as \u201cgaslighting\u201d, and recalled receiving messages from management such as, \u201cIf the TVCs want to work more, let them work more.\u201d All seven current and former employees interviewed by the Guardian said they had either experienced or witnessed contract workers performing unpaid overtime.</p> <p>\u201cTo my knowledge, no one ever said, you need to work TVCs above their contracts, but it was set up so that it was the only way to get the expected work done, and if anyone raised concerns they would be openly mocked and belittled,\u201d said another current Googler.</p> <p>\u201cThe 40-hour thing was just not respected,\u201d said a former associate linguist. \u201cIt was made clear to us that we were never to <em>log</em> more than 40 hours, but we were never told not to <em>work</em> more than 40 hours.</p> <p>\u201cThe work that they assign often takes more than eight hours,\u201d they added. \u201cEvery week you fill out a timesheet. One person one time did submit overtime, and they were chastised. No punishment, but definitely told not to work overtime.\u201d</p> <p>A spokeswoman for Google said that it was company policy that temp workers must be paid for all hours worked, even if overtime was not approved in advance.</p> <p>\u201cWorking off the clock is the very definition of wage theft,\u201d said Beth Ross, a longtime labor and employment attorney. Ross said that both Google and Adecco could face liability for unpaid wages and damages under federal and state law.</p> <h2>\u2018They dangle that carrot\u2019</h2> <p>The associate linguist was one of several who said that they took the position at Google in hopes that they could eventually convert to a full-time position. Several members of Pygmalion are former contract workers, including the current head of the team, who took over from Ha, the executive who founded the team, in September 2017.</p> <p>\u201cPeople did [unpaid overtime] because they were dangled the opportunity of becoming a full-time employee, which is against company policy,\u201d a current Googler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular leveraging of people\u2019s desire to become full time,\u201d said another.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was hired, I was very explicitly told that there is no ladder,\u201d a current contract worker said. \u201c\u2018This is not a temp-to-hire position. There is no moving up\u2019 \u2026 But the reality on the team is very much one where there is clearly a ladder. A certain percentage of the associate linguists will get project manager. A certain percentage of project managers get converted to full time. We watch it happen, and they dangle that carrot.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"597f3b6015351068d692f578753de1e7f5a64082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/597f3b6015351068d692f578753de1e7f5a64082/0_20_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google employees enjoy perks such as free meals, on-site yoga classes, free massages and generous benefits packages.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google employees enjoy perks such as free meals, on-site yoga classes, free massages and generous benefits packages.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/REUTERS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One Googler who successfully converted to a full-time position after working as a temp on Pygmalion said that at times the bargain was even made explicit. In April 2017, they recalled, Ha attended a meeting of outsourced Pygmalion project managers in London and \u201cexplain[ed] that the position was designed for conversion and that we should be proactive in asking for more work in order to achieve this\u201d.</p> <p>Ha said that she had helped many contract workers convert to full-time positions.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018Designed for conversion\u2019 means that the TVC is now inside Google and has exposure and understanding of the culture (very important) and projects,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I was trying to say that they should reach out to project owners to gain Google experience. In no way was this statement related to working overtime and not getting paid. This was about opportunity and access.\u201d</p> <p>Ha also stressed that she was not responsible for Pygmalion after September 2017, when it moved to a new organization within Google and she started working on a different project.</p> <p>The Google spokeswoman said that it is company policy not to make any commitment about employment or conversion to temps, and that Googlers who manage temps are required to take a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/11/google-tvc-full-time-employees-training-document\">mandatory training</a> on this and other policies related to TVCs.</p> <h2>\u2018Why do it?\u2019</h2> <p>The disparity in wages and benefits between Google employees and contract workers is stark. Alphabet recently reported<a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/what-tech-companies-pay-employees-2019/\"> median pay</a> of $246,804, and employees enjoy perks such as free meals, on-site yoga classes, free massages and generous benefits.</p> <p>Amid increasing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/02/google-workers-sign-letter-temp-contractors-protest\">activism by Googlers and contract workers</a>, Google recently announced improved minimum standards for US-based contract workers, including a minimum of eight paid sick days, \u201ccomprehensive\u201d health insurance, and a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour by 2020. (A full-time job at that wage pays $31,200 a year; by comparison, Google charges its own employees $38,808 a year to place an infant in its onsite daycare facilities.)</p> <p>Wages for contract workers on the Pygmalion team are well above the new minimum standard, usually starting around $25 an hour for associate linguists and going up to $35 an hour for project managers. But contractors complain about subpar benefits and other indignities.</p> <p>The former project manager described Adecco\u2019s benefits plan as \u201cthe worst health insurance I have ever had\u201d. A current contract worker earning less than $60,000 annually said they were paying $180 each month in premiums for an individual plan with a $6,000 deductible. For families, the deductible is $12,000, according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. Google declined to comment on Adecco\u2019s pay and benefits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bb72c2f4b5bf1d7d18e0a227ce3268a3615a184\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb72c2f4b5bf1d7d18e0a227ce3268a3615a184/0_40_3947_2368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google workers have walked out over the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct claims and its treatment of temporary workers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google workers have walked out over the company\u2019s handling of sexual misconduct claims and its treatment of temporary workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noah Berger/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Googlers earn significantly more, and those on individual plans contribute between $0 and $53 for their health insurance and have a much lower deductible ($1,350), according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. Googlers with families pay up to $199 every two weeks, with a $2,700 deductible.</p> <p>Others complained of a lack of trust and respect. In 2018, Google revoked the ability for contractors on Pygmalion to work while riding Google\u2019s wifi-equipped commuter buses, creating frustration for those who spent three to four hours a day traveling to the company\u2019s Mountain View campus and could no longer work and count that time toward their shift. Google said it works to ensure that temps, vendors and contractors do not have over-broad access to sensitive internal information for security reasons. </p> <p>\u201cWhy do it?\u201d a former associate linguist said of working unpaid overtime under these conditions. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose the job. Having Google on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is important to a career \u2026 Later on, I came to find out that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/11/google-tvc-full-time-employees-training-document\">you can\u2019t say \u2018Google\u2019 on your r</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/11/google-tvc-full-time-employees-training-document\">\u00e9sum\u00e9</a>. You have to say \u2018Google by Adecco\u2019.\u201d</p> <h2>A weekend assignment</h2> <p>Both Google and Adecco recently launched investigations into the allegations of unpaid overtime in Pygmalion.</p> <p>\u201cOur policy is clear that all temporary workers must be paid for any overtime worked,\u201d said Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice-president of people operations, in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cIf we find that anyone isn\u2019t properly paid, we make sure they are compensated appropriately and take action against any Google employee who violates this policy.\u201d</p> <p>The current investigation was initiated after the company received a report of a possible policy violation in February 2019, the Google spokeswoman said. The company will provide appropriate compensation if need be and will take action up to and including terminations if policy violations are found, she added.</p> <p>The spokeswoman also acknowledged that concerns about unpaid overtime were raised to human resources in 2017, but said that the company investigated and did not find any such cases at the time.</p> <p>\u201cWe are committed to ensuring all employees are compensated for all time worked,\u201d said Mary Beth Waddill, a spokeswoman for Adecco. \u201cOur longstanding policy is that every employee is required to report time accurately \u2013 even if that time isn\u2019t pre-approved \u2013 and they should feel encouraged to do so by their managers. If we learn that this is not the case, we will work with Google to take appropriate action.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday 17 May, Adecco sent emails to current and former Pygmalion temps. Recipients were asked whether they reported all the hours they worked, and, if not, to estimate how many hours they worked unpaid. The emails requested a response by Monday 20 May, though a Google spokeswoman said this week that the deadline has been extended.</p> <p>A Google employee reacted: \u201cThey\u2019re asking people to work on the weekend to recall unbilled overwork. It seems like it\u2019s designed to discourage people from responding.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, one former contract worker who left the company many months ago said they received the email but did not bother to respond. \u201cAfter I left, I didn\u2019t keep records of the hours I worked,\u201d they said. \u201cEven if I wanted to report overtime now, how could I?\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was updated on 25 June to attribute the source of information about Linne Ha\u2019s firing from Google, to include the date when Ha ceased leading Pygmalion and to incorporate comment from Ha.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><em>Do you work in the tech industry?

It\u2019s to the point where I don\u2019t use the Google Assistant, because I know how it\u2019s made, and I can\u2019t support it.\u201d An \u2018army\u2019 of linguists The study of language is at the very heart of current advancements in computing. For decades, people have had to work to learn the language of computers, whether they were trying to program a VCR or writing software. Technology such as the Google Assistant reverses the equation: the computer understands natural human speech, in all its variations. Take, for example, the straightforward task of asking the Assistant to set a timer to go off in five minutes, a former employee on Pygmalion explained. There are infinite ways that users could phrase that request, such as \u201cSet a timer for five minutes\u201d; \u201cCan you ring the buzzer in five minutes?\u201d; or \u201cConfigurar una alarma para cinco minutos.\u201d The Assistant has to be able to convert the spoken request into text, then interpret the user\u2019s intended meaning to produce the desired outcome, all practically instantaneously. The technology that makes this possible is a form of machine learning. For a machine learning model to \u201cunderstand\u201d a language, it needs vast amounts of text that has been annotated by linguists to teach it the building blocks of human language, from parts of speech to syntactic relationships. Enter Pygmalion. The team was born in 2014, the brainchild of the longtime Google executive Linne Ha, to create the linguistic data sets required for Google\u2019s neural networks to learn dozens of languages. The \u201cpainstaking\u201d nature of the labor required to create this \u201chandcrafted\u201d data was featured in a 2016 article about Pygmalion\u2019s \u201cmassive team of PhD linguists\u201d by Wired. From the beginning, Google planned to build the team with just a handful of full-time employees while outsourcing the vast majority of the annotation work to an \u201carmy\u201d of subcontracted linguists around the world, documents reviewed by the Guardian and interviews with staff show. The appetite for Pygmalion\u2019s hand-labeled data, and the size of the team, has only increased over the years. Today, it includes 40 to 50 full-time Googlers and approximately 200 temporary workers contracted through agencies, including Adecco, a global staffing firm. The contract workers include associate linguists, who are tasked with annotation, and project managers, who oversee their work. All of the contract workers have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in linguistics, though many have master\u2019s degrees and some have doctorates. In addition to annotating data, the temp workers write \u201cgrammars\u201d for the Assistant, complex and technical work that requires considerable expertise and involves Google\u2019s code base. Their situation is comparable to adjunct professors on US college campuses: they are highly educated and highly skilled, performing work crucial to the company\u2019s mission, and shut out of the benefits and security that come with a tenured position. \u201cImagine going from producing PhD-level research and pushing forward the state of knowledge in the world to going to an annotation type job, where all you\u2019re doing all day is annotating data; it\u2019s very click, click, click,\u201d said a former project manager on Pygmalion. \u201cEveryone was trying to prove themselves because everyone was trying to work for Google. The competitive edge that happened among colleagues as TVCs was severe.\u201d In comments provided to the Guardian after publication, Ha said: \u201cThe quantity of hours would not have been relevant to being converted to a full-time role.\u201d She said that skills, education and expertise were the most important factors for potential hires, and that Google\u2019s challenging interview process is well known. \u201cI have preached that work/life balance is critical for life satisfaction and general well being,\u201d she said. \u201cI have said again and again that we are NOT saving lives, our work is not critical enough to be killing ourselves for our job.\u201d \u201cGoogle is a multibillion-dollar company,\u201d she added. \u201cI would NEVER ask for people to work and be unpaid. This goes against everything that I believe.\u201d \u2018The definition of wage theft\u2019 This dynamic created the incentive for temps to perform unpaid work. Managers took advantage by making it clear they wouldn\u2019t approve overtime for contract workers, while also assigning unrealistic amounts of work, current and former employees said. The pressure to complete assignments was \u201cimmense\u201d, said one Googler. \u201cIn this mixed stream of messages, I think a lot of people had to make their own calls, and given the pressure, I think people made different calls.\u201d The Googler described the overall effect as \u201cgaslighting\u201d, and recalled receiving messages from management such as, \u201cIf the TVCs want to work more, let them work more.\u201d All seven current and former employees interviewed by the Guardian said they had either experienced or witnessed contract workers performing unpaid overtime. \u201cTo my knowledge, no one ever said, you need to work TVCs above their contracts, but it was set up so that it was the only way to get the expected work done, and if anyone raised concerns they would be openly mocked and belittled,\u201d said another current Googler. \u201cThe 40-hour thing was just not respected,\u201d said a former associate linguist. \u201cIt was made clear to us that we were never to log more than 40 hours, but we were never told not to work more than 40 hours. \u201cThe work that they assign often takes more than eight hours,\u201d they added. \u201cEvery week you fill out a timesheet. One person one time did submit overtime, and they were chastised. No punishment, but definitely told not to work overtime.\u201d A spokeswoman for Google said that it was company policy that temp workers must be paid for all hours worked, even if overtime was not approved in advance. \u201cWorking off the clock is the very definition of wage theft,\u201d said Beth Ross, a longtime labor and employment attorney. Ross said that both Google and Adecco could face liability for unpaid wages and damages under federal and state law. \u2018They dangle that carrot\u2019 The associate linguist was one of several who said that they took the position at Google in hopes that they could eventually convert to a full-time position. Several members of Pygmalion are former contract workers, including the current head of the team, who took over from Ha, the executive who founded the team, in September 2017. \u201cPeople did [unpaid overtime] because they were dangled the opportunity of becoming a full-time employee, which is against company policy,\u201d a current Googler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular leveraging of people\u2019s desire to become full time,\u201d said another. \u201cWhen I was hired, I was very explicitly told that there is no ladder,\u201d a current contract worker said. \u201c\u2018This is not a temp-to-hire position. There is no moving up\u2019 \u2026 But the reality on the team is very much one where there is clearly a ladder. A certain percentage of the associate linguists will get project manager. A certain percentage of project managers get converted to full time. We watch it happen, and they dangle that carrot.\u201d One Googler who successfully converted to a full-time position after working as a temp on Pygmalion said that at times the bargain was even made explicit. In April 2017, they recalled, Ha attended a meeting of outsourced Pygmalion project managers in London and \u201cexplain[ed] that the position was designed for conversion and that we should be proactive in asking for more work in order to achieve this\u201d. Ha said that she had helped many contract workers convert to full-time positions. \u201c\u2018Designed for conversion\u2019 means that the TVC is now inside Google and has exposure and understanding of the culture (very important) and projects,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I was trying to say that they should reach out to project owners to gain Google experience. In no way was this statement related to working overtime and not getting paid. This was about opportunity and access.\u201d Ha also stressed that she was not responsible for Pygmalion after September 2017, when it moved to a new organization within Google and she started working on a different project. The Google spokeswoman said that it is company policy not to make any commitment about employment or conversion to temps, and that Googlers who manage temps are required to take a mandatory training on this and other policies related to TVCs. \u2018Why do it?\u2019 The disparity in wages and benefits between Google employees and contract workers is stark. Alphabet recently reported median pay of $246,804, and employees enjoy perks such as free meals, on-site yoga classes, free massages and generous benefits. Amid increasing activism by Googlers and contract workers, Google recently announced improved minimum standards for US-based contract workers, including a minimum of eight paid sick days, \u201ccomprehensive\u201d health insurance, and a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour by 2020. (A full-time job at that wage pays $31,200 a year; by comparison, Google charges its own employees $38,808 a year to place an infant in its onsite daycare facilities.) Wages for contract workers on the Pygmalion team are well above the new minimum standard, usually starting around $25 an hour for associate linguists and going up to $35 an hour for project managers. But contractors complain about subpar benefits and other indignities. The former project manager described Adecco\u2019s benefits plan as \u201cthe worst health insurance I have ever had\u201d. A current contract worker earning less than $60,000 annually said they were paying $180 each month in premiums for an individual plan with a $6,000 deductible. For families, the deductible is $12,000, according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. Google declined to comment on Adecco\u2019s pay and benefits. Googlers earn significantly more, and those on individual plans contribute between $0 and $53 for their health insurance and have a much lower deductible ($1,350), according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. Googlers with families pay up to $199 every two weeks, with a $2,700 deductible. Others complained of a lack of trust and respect. In 2018, Google revoked the ability for contractors on Pygmalion to work while riding Google\u2019s wifi-equipped commuter buses, creating frustration for those who spent three to four hours a day traveling to the company\u2019s Mountain View campus and could no longer work and count that time toward their shift. Google said it works to ensure that temps, vendors and contractors do not have over-broad access to sensitive internal information for security reasons. \u201cWhy do it?\u201d a former associate linguist said of working unpaid overtime under these conditions. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose the job. Having Google on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is important to a career \u2026 Later on, I came to find out that you can\u2019t say \u2018Google\u2019 on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. You have to say \u2018Google by Adecco\u2019.\u201d A weekend assignment Both Google and Adecco recently launched investigations into the allegations of unpaid overtime in Pygmalion. \u201cOur policy is clear that all temporary workers must be paid for any overtime worked,\u201d said Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice-president of people operations, in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cIf we find that anyone isn\u2019t properly paid, we make sure they are compensated appropriately and take action against any Google employee who violates this policy.\u201d The current investigation was initiated after the company received a report of a possible policy violation in February 2019, the Google spokeswoman said. The company will provide appropriate compensation if need be and will take action up to and including terminations if policy violations are found, she added. The spokeswoman also acknowledged that concerns about unpaid overtime were raised to human resources in 2017, but said that the company investigated and did not find any such cases at the time. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring all employees are compensated for all time worked,\u201d said Mary Beth Waddill, a spokeswoman for Adecco. \u201cOur longstanding policy is that every employee is required to report time accurately \u2013 even if that time isn\u2019t pre-approved \u2013 and they should feel encouraged to do so by their managers. If we learn that this is not the case, we will work with Google to take appropriate action.\u201d On Friday 17 May, Adecco sent emails to current and former Pygmalion temps. Recipients were asked whether they reported all the hours they worked, and, if not, to estimate how many hours they worked unpaid. The emails requested a response by Monday 20 May, though a Google spokeswoman said this week that the deadline has been extended. A Google employee reacted: \u201cThey\u2019re asking people to work on the weekend to recall unbilled overwork. It seems like it\u2019s designed to discourage people from responding.\u201d Indeed, one former contract worker who left the company many months ago said they received the email but did not bother to respond. \u201cAfter I left, I didn\u2019t keep records of the hours I worked,\u201d they said. \u201cEven if I wanted to report overtime now, how could I?\u201d This article was updated on 25 June to attribute the source of information about Linne Ha\u2019s firing from Google, to include the date when Ha ceased leading Pygmalion and to incorporate comment from Ha.

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 26 June.</p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Australians are increasingly wary about China</strong> and worry about the potential for foreign interference in our democracy, according to new polling from a major foreign policy thinktank. The survey comes on the same day Scott Morrison will deliver a speech warning of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/26/scott-morrison-warns-of-collateral-damage-in-region-from-us-china-rift\">\u201ccollateral damage\u201d in the region</a> from the US-China rift. The Lowy Institute poll suggests trust by Australians in China to be a responsible global actor has hit its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/25/australians-trust-in-china-at-lowest-point-in-surveys-history\">lowest point since the survey began</a> 15 years ago. Clear majorities also feel Australia is too economically dependent on China (74%) and there is too much inbound investment from Beijing (68%). </p> <p><strong>A whistleblower has accused the government of flagrantly breaching laws to thwart the release of politically sensitive documents</strong>, including records of Tony Abbott\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/26/whistleblower-hits-out-at-pms-department-over-pervasive-and-toxic-disregard-for-law\">taxpayer-funded entitlements</a>. A freedom of information officer who has worked across the federal government blew the whistle internally in late 2017 on what he described as a \u201cculture of disdain for the rule of law\u201d within the prime minister\u2019s department. The whistleblower alleged the department had breached FoI law in one of every two requests it received, particularly when the documents were embarrassing or sensitive. The whistleblower collated 25 examples of requests that had been handled unlawfully, saying they showed a \u201cpolitically motivated, pervasive, and toxic\u201d disregard for the law. The complaint <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/02/how-a-flawed-freedom-of-info\">aligns with the concerns among experts and former insiders</a> at the information watchdog, who fear that, in some cases, documents are being deliberately withheld until the \u201cheat\u201d has gone out of political controversies.</p> <p><strong>Public health experts are appalled the Woolworths-owned BWS alcohol chain has partnered with the Dry July Foundation</strong>, which raises money for cancer sufferers. BWS announced its support for the charity last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/26/dry-july-organisers-urged-to-dump-partnership-deal-with-liquor-chain-bws\">saying it will help promote no-alcohol beers, ciders and spirits</a> and sales staff will take part in the annual fundraiser. The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education chief executive, Michael Thorn, described the arrangement as \u201cill-conceived\u201d and said it should be dumped immediately. Thorn said it was akin to big tobacco companies supporting a lung cancer charity or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2018/may/23/manufacture-sell-deploy-commemorate-is-this-how-we-should-memorialise-war\">arms dealers sponsoring the Australian War Memorial.</a></p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"867c0093c849e114598590e8ef008d4396567cf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/867c0093c849e114598590e8ef008d4396567cf1/8_18_1974_1184/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump and Hassan Rouhani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Iranian and US presidents have traded insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffers from a \u201cmental disorder\u201d</strong> and Trump once more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/25/trump-iran-rouhani-insults-sanctions-threats\">threatening Iran with \u201cobliteration\u201d</a>.

Alston is critical of the \u201cpatently inadequate\u201d steps taken by the UN, countries, NGOs and businesses, saying they are \u201centirely disproportionate to the urgency and magnitude of the threat\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 26 June. Top stories Australians are increasingly wary about China and worry about the potential for foreign interference in our democracy, according to new polling from a major foreign policy thinktank. The survey comes on the same day Scott Morrison will deliver a speech warning of \u201ccollateral damage\u201d in the region from the US-China rift. The Lowy Institute poll suggests trust by Australians in China to be a responsible global actor has hit its lowest point since the survey began 15 years ago. Clear majorities also feel Australia is too economically dependent on China (74%) and there is too much inbound investment from Beijing (68%). A whistleblower has accused the government of flagrantly breaching laws to thwart the release of politically sensitive documents, including records of Tony Abbott\u2019s taxpayer-funded entitlements. A freedom of information officer who has worked across the federal government blew the whistle internally in late 2017 on what he described as a \u201cculture of disdain for the rule of law\u201d within the prime minister\u2019s department. The whistleblower alleged the department had breached FoI law in one of every two requests it received, particularly when the documents were embarrassing or sensitive. The whistleblower collated 25 examples of requests that had been handled unlawfully, saying they showed a \u201cpolitically motivated, pervasive, and toxic\u201d disregard for the law. The complaint aligns with the concerns among experts and former insiders at the information watchdog, who fear that, in some cases, documents are being deliberately withheld until the \u201cheat\u201d has gone out of political controversies. Public health experts are appalled the Woolworths-owned BWS alcohol chain has partnered with the Dry July Foundation, which raises money for cancer sufferers. BWS announced its support for the charity last week, saying it will help promote no-alcohol beers, ciders and spirits and sales staff will take part in the annual fundraiser. The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education chief executive, Michael Thorn, described the arrangement as \u201cill-conceived\u201d and said it should be dumped immediately. Thorn said it was akin to big tobacco companies supporting a lung cancer charity or arms dealers sponsoring the Australian War Memorial. World The Iranian and US presidents have traded insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffers from a \u201cmental disorder\u201d and Trump once more threatening Iran with \u201cobliteration\u201d. The first phase of the Trump administration\u2019s long-awaited peace plan for Israel and Palestine has, meanwhile, been rolled out to scepticism, anger and outright derision, with a deal seeming further away than ever. Boris Johnson has hardened his position on leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d by the end of October, as hardline Eurosceptics extended their influence on his faltering campaign to be the UK\u2019s PM. Breakdancing has moved a step closer to being included in the 2024 Olympic Games. Known as breaking in Olympic circles, it is one of four sports Paris wants to add to its program, though the other three \u2013 skateboarding, sport climbing and surfing \u2013 will make Summer Games debuts next year in Tokyo. Cities around the US are no longer recycling many types of plastic dropped into recycling bins, a Guardian investigation has found. From Los Angeles to Florida to the Arizona desert, officials say, vast quantities of plastic are now no better than garbage. A record high of 45C is expected in France as an unprecedented, potentially deadly early summer heatwave sweeps across Europe. National high temperature records set mostly in late July or August are likely to be broken across the continent. Opinion and analysis The world is increasingly at risk of \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d, a report from a UN human rights expert has said, where the rich pay to escape heat and hunger caused by the escalating climate crisis while the rest of the world suffers. Philip Alston, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said the impacts of global heating are likely to undermine not only basic rights to life, water, food and housing for hundreds of millions of people, but also democracy and the rule of law. Alston is critical of the \u201cpatently inadequate\u201d steps taken by the UN, countries, NGOs and businesses, saying they are \u201centirely disproportionate to the urgency and magnitude of the threat\u201d. His report to the UN human rights council concludes: \u201cHuman rights might not survive the coming upheaval.\u201d It\u2019s no longer ideologies that define and divide Australian politics, writes Richard Denniss. \u201cWhile the philosophical positions adopted by political parties might be all over the shop, the interests they support remain remarkably stable. The right tend to line up behind wealth, power and the establishment, and the left fire up to support new industries that solve new problems, and to protect marginalised groups from established institutions.\u201d Sport Australia has delivered a hammer blow to England\u2019s Cricket World Cup hopes with a comprehensive 64-run victory, in which Australia dominated from start to finish. Andy Murray has tasted doubles defeat at Eastbourne, while Dan Evans is prospering, writes Kevin Mitchell. \u201cIf Andy Murray epitomises artful struggle \u2013 and the Scot\u2019s first stumble in his comeback here on Tuesday, when the excellent Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Cabal and Robert Farah beat him and Marcelo Melo 6-2, 6-4, in just over an hour, was not a seismic shock \u2013 Evans is the hero of the artful dodgers, a reformed rebel with educated hands and a quick brain.\u201d Thinking time: Meet the network of thinkers transforming capitalism \u201cThere is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet,\u201d writes Andy Beckett.

She\u2019s a star.\u201d Greater Manchester police said in a statement: \u201cA few weeks ago, a member of the community approached a GMP PCSO from the North Manchester division with a slightly unusual request. \u201cThe woman mentioned that her 93-year-old grandmother had a request on her bucket list that she was hoping GMP would help her fulfil. \u201cThe request was for the grandmother to be \u2018arrested\u2019 and be taken to one of our police stations so she could experience what it was like to be on the wrong side of the law.\u201d Ch Insp Denise Pye of the force\u2019s City of Manchester division said: \u201cThe focus of our PCSOs is heavily driven by our community and how we can support them \u2026 On this occasion, and for a short period of time, we were able to fulfil the wishes of an elderly lady, and give her a day to remember. \u201cWe can reassure the rest of the community that while this was happening, officers from across the area were continuing with their duties to ensure this short visit had no impact whatsoever on the wider area. \u201cWe want the community to feel reassured in our presence and comfortable in approaching any of our officers when they see us out and about. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to see that we were able to make an elderly lady smile and tick one thing off her bucket list.\u201d It is not the first incident of its kind. In March, Anne Brokenbrow, 104, had her wish of being arrested granted, after relaying her desire to her Bristol care home. Brokenbrow said it was an enjoyable experience: \u201cI had a lovely day, it was interesting. Nothing like that ever happened to me before. They put the handcuffs on, I had the lot.\u201d",

It has been described as \u201cexperimental\u201d for its long paragraphs and use of descriptions rather than character names.</p> <p>Tom Sutcliffe, the chair of judges for the prize and BBC Radio 4 presenter, described the book\u2019s tone of voice as \u201ca marvel\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cMilkman is a remarkable book \u2013 recording a specific time and a specific conflict with brilliant precision but universal in its account of how political allegiances crush and deform our instinctive human loyalties,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Spectator\u2019s literary editor, Sam Leith, the author Preti Taneja and Dr Xine Yao, an American literature lecturer at UCL, were the other judges of the award.</p> <p>Last year, Belfast-born Burns became the first Northern Irish author to win the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/16/anna-burns-wins-man-booker-prize-for-incredibly-original-milkman\">Man Booker prize for Milkman</a>. The book, her third novel, also picked up the National Book Critics Circle award in 2019.</p> <p>Say Nothing, by the New Yorker magazine staff writer Radden Keefe, forensically details the murder of Jean McConville by the IRA in 1972.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/06/jean-mcconvilles-daughter-give-up-fighting-helen-mckendry-ira\">McConville</a>, a widowed mother who was abducted from her Belfast home in the presence of her children, was suspected of being an informer by the paramilitary organisation.</p> <p>Tulip Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, who chaired the judges for the award, described Say Nothing as \u201can extraordinary piece of writing\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt comes across as an immensely personal tale yet encompasses the historical narrative of the situation in Northern Ireland,\u201d she added.</p> <p>Other judges for the Orwell prize for political writing were Ted Hodgkinson, head of literature and spoken word at Southbank centre, The Times\u2019 literary editor, Robbie Millen, and the author and women\u2019s rights activist Helen Pankhurst.</p> <p>The director of the Orwell Foundation, Prof Jean Seaton, described the Northern Irish peace process \u2013 which brought 30 years of bitter conflict to a close \u2013 as \u201carguably the greatest achievement of UK diplomacy since the second world war\u201d.</p> <p>She added that people \u201cstill need reminding of the horrors this process ended\u201d.</p> <p>The winners of both prizes, which are worth \u00a33,000, were unveiled on Tuesday at University College London \u2013 on the late author George Orwell\u2019s birthday.</p> <p>The Orwell prize for journalism and the Orwell prize for exposing Britain\u2019s social evils, sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, were also handed out.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Two books about the Troubles in Northern Ireland have been announced as the winners of the Orwell prize 2019. Anna Burns\u2019 experimental novel Milkman won the inaugural prize for political fiction, while the prize for political writing was awarded to Patrick Radden Keefe for his book Say Nothing. Milkman follows the story of an 18-year-old girl who is harassed by a much older and married paramilitary. It has been described as \u201cexperimental\u201d for its long paragraphs and use of descriptions rather than character names. Tom Sutcliffe, the chair of judges for the prize and BBC Radio 4 presenter, described the book\u2019s tone of voice as \u201ca marvel\u201d. \u201cMilkman is a remarkable book \u2013 recording a specific time and a specific conflict with brilliant precision but universal in its account of how political allegiances crush and deform our instinctive human loyalties,\u201d he said. The Spectator\u2019s literary editor, Sam Leith, the author Preti Taneja and Dr Xine Yao, an American literature lecturer at UCL, were the other judges of the award. Last year, Belfast-born Burns became the first Northern Irish author to win the Man Booker prize for Milkman. The book, her third novel, also picked up the National Book Critics Circle award in 2019. Say Nothing, by the New Yorker magazine staff writer Radden Keefe, forensically details the murder of Jean McConville by the IRA in 1972. McConville, a widowed mother who was abducted from her Belfast home in the presence of her children, was suspected of being an informer by the paramilitary organisation. Tulip Siddiq, Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, who chaired the judges for the award, described Say Nothing as \u201can extraordinary piece of writing\u201d. \u201cIt comes across as an immensely personal tale yet encompasses the historical narrative of the situation in Northern Ireland,\u201d she added. Other judges for the Orwell prize for political writing were Ted Hodgkinson, head of literature and spoken word at Southbank centre, The Times\u2019 literary editor, Robbie Millen, and the author and women\u2019s rights activist Helen Pankhurst. The director of the Orwell Foundation, Prof Jean Seaton, described the Northern Irish peace process \u2013 which brought 30 years of bitter conflict to a close \u2013 as \u201carguably the greatest achievement of UK diplomacy since the second world war\u201d. She added that people \u201cstill need reminding of the horrors this process ended\u201d. The winners of both prizes, which are worth \u00a33,000, were unveiled on Tuesday at University College London \u2013 on the late author George Orwell\u2019s birthday. The Orwell prize for journalism and the Orwell prize for exposing Britain\u2019s social evils, sponsored by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, were also handed out.",

He says he wants to \u201ccut taxes on ordinary people\u201d but still spend vast sums on various social projects.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>And the only way that you can afford all of those things is to fire up the British economy. And, as someone who set up their own business, I want to help thousands more young people set up their businesses. Let me just give you this one example, Laura: We\u2019re growing at 1.5% a year at the moment. If we were growing at 3% a year, which is the American growth rate, we\u2019d have an extra \u00a320bn to spend on public services or tax cuts. All conservatives want to do both of those things and that\u2019s why my first focus is to really grow the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Kuenssberg points out that his corporation tax cut would \u201cprobably be about \u00a313bn\u201d, that he wants to spend an extra \u00a315bn on defence and more money on caring for the elderly. She asks if the no-deal Brexit he\u2019s willing to pursue would not end up costing the treasury yet more money. \u201cWhere are you going to get all that cash from? I mean would you borrow more than Philip Hammond has as Chancellor?\u201d</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No, I will follow a fiscal rule that is very clear that debt will continue to fall as a proportion of GDP over the cycle and we\u2019ve costed these commitments very very carefully indeed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hunt adds that he wants to cut corporation tax to \u201cIrish levels\u201d, proposing a levy of 12.5%, rather than the current main rate, which is set at 19%.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When they made that move a number of years ago, their GDP per head was lower than ours. Now it\u2019s nearly 50% higher than ours. So, this is the way that we fire up the economy: we create the jobs; we get the money for our precious public services like the NHS; transform our social care system; and find tax cuts.

And I do think that councils need more money because I think we want to be a country where we know that as people get older they\u2019re going to be properly looked after.</p> \n   <p>So I think there is a bit of public money. But it\u2019s also about personal responsibility. I think we should be a country where people save for their social care costs, particularly those last few months, possibly years of their life when things can be very uncomfortable, very painful. Just In the same way they save for their pension. I think it should be something that people can opt out of but it should be an automatic thing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked if he would cap<strong> </strong>social care costs \u2013 an issue that caused <strong>Theresa May</strong> significant damage at the 2017 general election \u2013 he says those who had saved would have their costs capped.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019d do a deal. If you\u2019re prepared to save responsibly during your life, then we will cut those costs. Do the right thing. We need to be a country which rewards people who do the right thing and I think if we do that, if you look at where we were in the post-war period where many people didn\u2019t save for their pensions, we\u2019ve created a society where the majority of people do save for their pensions. That\u2019s the change we need for social care.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He does not elaborate on what would happen to those who had not saved, nor does he give any details about the amount that would need to be saved to benefit from the cut in costs, nor how much of a cut would be made.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d12653c8f082364d7cf12c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T18:35:06.552Z\">7.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Addressing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Hunt says that, while it\u2019s not his preferred option, he would take it if he didn\u2019t think a deal was possible by 31 October \u2013 even though he acknowledges it\u2019d destroy people\u2019s livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that \u2018<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\">31st of October come hell or high water</a>\u2019 is a fake deadline, because it\u2019s more likely to trip us into a general election before we\u2019ve delivered Brexit, and that would hand the keys to Jeremy Corbyn and then we\u2019d have no Brexit at all.</p> \n   <p>But, in my case, how would I approach this: I think we\u2019ll know very soon well before 31st October if there is a deal to be done along the basis I\u2019ve said. If there isn\u2019t and if no-deal is still on the table, I\u2019ve been very clear: I will leave the European Union without a deal.</p> \n   <p>But I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and, if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction.

It\u2019s what Theresa May tried and failed to do many times\u201d.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, what Theresa May tried to do was a deal involving the backstop.

He insists, as he has done before, that he\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/09/jeremy-hunt-claims-merkel-willing-to-renegotiate-brexit-deal\">being given a different message</a> in conversations with European leaders.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I talk to European leaders, what they say is: \u2018look, it\u2019s up to the UK to come up with a solution.

It\u2019s perhaps worth pointing out, however, that what Germany did not say is that it\u2019s willing to back down on the overall object of the backstop: preventing a hard border.</p> \n  <p>Asked what he would change to that end, Hunt acknowledges his plan is similar to that of his opponent.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It would be changing the backstop with some guarantees that we\u2019re not going to have a hard border on the island of Ireland for completely obvious reasons. That approach is not too different to what Boris wants. I think it\u2019ll be a technology-led solution.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What, exactly, that \u201ctechnology-led solution\u201d entails remains something of a mystery, however, as Hunt is short on details in the interview on how he actually sees it working. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think everyone thinks that, within the next decade, we aren\u2019t going to have big border checks when it comes to goods because we\u2019re going to do all these things online, just like the rest of our lives is transformed. And that discussion is what do you do if there\u2019s a disagreement about what technology can do, so you need some mechanisms that resolve those disputes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>While Germany is ready to discuss options, the EU has rejected the idea that solely technological means can effectively replace border checks.</p> \n  <p>In the interview, however, Hunt says he thinks that very solution \u201cis ready\u201d to be put in place right away and that he believes the bloc has simply been unwilling thus far to discuss it because it wants to keep the UK in the customs union.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But I think they know now that won\u2019t get through Parliament. So what I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s not be negative, let\u2019s not be pessimistic. There is a way we can do this but what we have to do is send the right prime minister to Brussels to have those negotiations, have those open discussions and then I think there is a deal to be done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T19:13:56.952Z\">at 8.13pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d125e2d8f081e872734eb17\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T17:59:56.857Z\">6.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In his interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, <strong>Laura Kuenssberg, </strong>Hunt returns again and again to the question of character, insisting he can be trusted to negotiate a deal with the EU.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris and I want to change that deal and the judgement is: who is the person we trust as PM to go to Brussels and bring back that deal? It\u2019s about the personality of our PM. If you choose someone where there\u2019s no trust, there\u2019s going to be no negotiation, no deal. And, quite possibly, a general election, which could mean we have no Brexit either. If you choose someone that the other side will talk to who\u2019s going to be very tough, there will least be in negotiation and I believe this deal to be done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The significance of this approach \u2013 particularly at a time when his opponent has been facing so many questions about his own temperament and attention to detail \u2013 is difficult to overstate. Hunt, however, tries to play it down. Asked if he thinks Johnson would be an untrustworthy prime minister, he says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would never make those comments about a fellow candidate. I would serve Boris Johnson to the very best of my ability and make his prime ministership a success and I hope he\u2019d do the same for me. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>It\u2019s pointed out that it\u2019s somewhat implausible \u2013 in a two-horse race \u2013 to suggest he is not casting Johnson as untrustworthy. He responds:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No I\u2019m saying I am trustworthy and I do believe that I can be trusted to deliver this deal.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He\u2019s also asked how he can be trusted by the EU, given that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/01/jeremy-hunt-draws-eu-ire-over-soviet-prison-comparison\">caused a major row</a> when he compared the bloc to the Soviet Union last year. He says:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I am not afraid to speak uncomfortable truths to our partners in the EU. The point I made in that speech was it was totally inappropriate for an organisation that was set up to defend freedom to make it impossible for a member to leave. I will say tough things when I need to say tough things. But I\u2019ll also preserve the relationship. I think I\u2019ve also shown as foreign secretary that I can have good links with European countries.

But there have been various hints along the way that this might be a promise that he does not expect to keep.

At a meeting with business leaders, although Johnson said that he would go for a no-deal if necessary to meet the October deadline, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48680303\">some in the audience concluded he did not mean it</a>. And last week the Evening Standard, edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, said <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/comment/comment/evening-standard-comment-we-back-boris-as-the-pm-to-turn-britain-around-a4171816.html\">it was backing Johnson for party leader because it thought he would be more flexible on Brexit than any of the other candidates</a> and because he had not \u201cguaranteed\u201d (it judged) Brexit by 31 October.</p> \n  <p>Well, now Johnson is firmly guaranteeing Brexit by 31 October.

My colleague <strong>Ben Quinn</strong> has written it up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/gordon-brown-unity-of-uk-at-risk-from-hijacking-of-patriotism-brexit\">here</a>, but here are some lengthy extracts which deserved a wider audience. The full text does not seem to be available on the web.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown said Boris Johnson as prime minister would exploit English nationalism to secure a Tory election victory \u2013 putting the future of the United Kingdom at risk. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Unless [Johnson] specifically rules it out, he will almost certainly \u2013 and under the influence of his election guru \u2013 play the \u2018English card\u2019, whipping up English nationalistic fervour against Scotland for English votes that put at risk the union itself.</p> \n   <p>If the precedent was set by David Cameron with his posters of the Labour leader in the pocket of the Scottish first minister, think of a similar Lynton Crosby campaign for Johnson \u2013 the claim that a Corbyn minority government, dependent on SNP votes, would grant another independence referendum to the SNP.</p> \n   <p>It is right to warn of the SNP\u2019s obsession with independence. It is right, too, for us to remind Labour that as a party of the union it can never and must never make a backdoor deal with the SNP. </p> \n   <p>But of course, that\u2019s not the point of the Crosby-Johnson exercise: their interest is not that the SNP or Labour have the best policies in the national interest: their aim is to whip up English nationalist fervour against Scotland simply to secure a Tory victory \u2013 and even at the cost of harming the union. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown said Johnson was opposed to the principles that underpin the union. </strong>He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson is not just defining his patriotism as being anti-European. </p> \n   <p>Look at what he has written on the union \u2013 not in the heat of the moment during a referendum, but continuously over 20 years. What his writing adds up to is a manifesto vehemently opposing the three constitutional pillars upon which today\u2019s union is built: Scottish representation in the UK parliament, Scottish devolution and Scottish funding.</p> \n   <p>First, representation: he believes that that the number of Scottish MPs in the UK parliament should be substantially reduced.</p> \n   <p>Unable to understand careful care has to be taken in any union \u2013 whether the USA, Germany or Australia \u2013 when considering the representation of minorities, he continues to argue that Scotland is grossly overrepresented at Westminster. </p> \n   <p>When it comes to the devolution settlement, he would curtail the Scottish parliament making their own decisions in devolved areas such as universities and social care.</p> \n   <p>And he also opposes as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cunfair to England\u201d the financial linchpin of the union \u2013 the 40-year-old UK-wide settlement, the Barnett formula \u2013 which allocates resources by taking account of differing needs and changing demography across the four nations of the UK. </p> \n   <p>And if the Scots were in dire need he would have an answer: \u201cI propose that we tell them to hop it.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The SNP think of him as their best recruiting sergeant for independence. And, not surprisingly, few Scots believe the union is safe in his hands, fearing whether through ignorance, carelessness or malice he will be prepared to play fast and loose with the union when it suits his personal electoral needs. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson, of course, would dispute this. Recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/18/tory-leadership-bbc-debate-boris-johnson-voting-results-gets-fresh-boost-as-leadsom-gives-her-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c#block-5d092fc68f08374cc5790a9c\">Nicola Sturgeon said he had jokingly floated the idea of offering Scotland full fiscal autonomy</a>.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown said the United Kingdom needed more than just four nationalisms to survive.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>But Scottish nationalism plus English nationalism plus Welsh nationalism plus Ulster nationalism does not add up to a United Kingdom. Four nations united only by nationalism will not sustain the United Kingdom. It means a house divided that cannot stand for long.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He criticised Nigel Farage\u2019s style of nationalism.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If Britain is seen by us not just as traditionally tolerant and fair-minded but as outward looking, what do we find in the Farage brand of nationalism? A Britain that for him is glorying in isolation, viewing every institution with the word \u201cEuropean\u201d or \u201cglobal\u201d in its title as \u201cthe enemy\u201d or as hostile territory.</p> \n   <p>So where does this intolerant, divisive, inward-looking nationalism take us? It leads us exactly where divisive continental nationalisms led us in the past \u2013 to targeting and then blaming and demonising immigrants, foreigners and anyone who stands in the Farage way \u2013 and, of course, using language designed to induce uncertainty, fear and discord, rebutting any criticisms and countering any arguments with the now familiar trademark accusations of \u201cbetrayal\u201d.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brown argued for an alternative form of patriotism.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can love your country without being made to feel you ever have to hate your neighbour.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed the SNP were now pushing for a more extreme form of independence than in 2014.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the 2014 Scottish referendum the nationalists proposed leaving the UK political union but said they wanted to keep the UK pound and to stay inside the UK custom union and the UK single market.</p> \n   <p>Now they are committed to a wholly separate Scottish pound and to abandon, in a quiet, almost furtive way the UK customs union and single market which has given us tariff-free, tension-free trade across the four nations for 300 years and prevented what now seems inevitable under independence: a hard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall separating Scotland and England and life reduced to an unending battle between us and them.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is an ingenious argument, but not a wholly fair one. In 2014 the Scottish government did not have a straightforward currency policy, because the UK parties rejected its call for a currency union, and this became a big problem for the yes campaign. Now the SNP has agreed that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48069470\">Scotland should have its own currency as soon as possible after independence</a>, but the notion of a \u201chard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall\u201d is Brown spin.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said citizens\u2019 assemblies could help build a more informed democracy.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Even now there may be a way to reset our relationships with the world: recognising that trust has broken down because, in our representative democracies, political parties are no longer performing their traditional role of assembling and then aggregating public opinion to build an informed consensus.</p> \n   <p>And in their place, Facebook, Twitter and our social media give a spurious impression of direct democracy as if leaders and led are communicating with each other on equal terms. However, at its best the internet promotes a shouting match without an umpire and, at worst, an echo chamber isolating and reverberating the most extremist of views. </p> \n   <p>So we should attempt to build a more informed democracy through region-by-region public hearings \u2013 what in Ireland were called citizens\u2019 assemblies \u2013 where we encourage an honest debate on all the specific options for our future.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f720e2da6210f2b16abaeb1bcd54364d2bc162a1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f720e2da6210f2b16abaeb1bcd54364d2bc162a1/0_80_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gordon Brown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gordon Brown</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T15:59:39.688Z\">at 4.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1228a88f082364d7cf0f55\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T14:03:36.445Z\">3.03pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the video of <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> talking about his secret model bus-making habit.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5899d936-e360-4097-bfe2-aef4bc2e9456\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gLcCZjDoWTQ?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Judging by social media, some people seem to find this account of how Johnson relaxes even less plausible than his Brexit plan \u2026</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T14:15:18.906Z\">at 3.15pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d1223118f082364d7cf0f0f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T13:38:21.783Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>At Foreign Office questions in the Commons this morning<strong> Emily Thornberry</strong>, the shadow foreign secretary, cracked a joke about Boris Johnson\u2019s late-night row with his girlfriend on Thursday last week.

But today, when asked that question, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think that it follows from everything that I\u2019ve said, that I think politics is at a crossroads in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed government \u201cdefeatism\u201d under Theresa May had been partly to blame for the UK not achieving Brexit.</strong> Claiming that his own optimism about Brexit would help to secure a deal, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think a bit of positive energy would help, frankly. I\u2019ve never seen such morosity and gloom from a government. For three years we\u2019ve been sitting around wrapped in defeatism telling the British public that they can\u2019t do this or that. It is pathetic, it\u2019s absolutely pathetic. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that he wanted to agree a new withdrawal agreement with the EU.</strong> He said that the current withdrawal agreement would need to go, but that he would want to keep some aspects of it. When asked if that meant he would be pushing for changes to the withdrawal agreement text, and not just changes to the political declaration (the accompanying text, covering the future relationship), Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[We need] more than a change. It\u2019s got to be, you know, we need a new withdrawal agreement. If we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement.<strong> Donald Tusk</strong>, the president of the European council, explained its position for the umpteenth time after last week\u2019s EU summit<a href=\"https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/06/21/remarks-by-president-donald-tusk-after-the-euro-summit-meeting-on-21-june-2019/\"> when he said:</a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are open for talks when it comes to the declaration on the future UK-EU relations if the position of the United Kingdom were to evolve, but the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson admitted that the UK would not be able to use article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) to carry on tariff-free trade with the EU unilaterally in the event of a no-deal Brexit. </strong>Some Brexiters have implied that article 24 means the UK has nothing to fear from a no-deal Brexit, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/18/tory-leadership-bbc-debate-boris-johnson-voting-results-gets-fresh-boost-as-leadsom-gives-her-support-live-news?page=with:block-5d093a088f08374cc5790b03#block-5d093a088f08374cc5790b03\">Johnson himself suggested as much in the BBC debate last week. </a>But today he was more circumspect. When asked if <strong>Mark Carney</strong>, the governor of the Bank of England, was right to say<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/brexit-mark-carney-dismisses-boris-johnson-trade-claim-on-no-deal\"> article 24 would not apply in a no-deal situation,</a> Johnson told LBC: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, he\u2019s right in the sense that Gatt article 24 paragraph males it perfectly clear that two countries that are in the process of beginning a free trade agreement may protract their existing arrangements until such time as they have completed any free trade agreement. And that\u2019s a very hopeful prospect. That is the way forward ...</p> \n   <p>Where Mark is right is saying that implies mutuality, there has to be agreement on both sides.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also admitted there had been \u201csome confusion\u201d about article 24. When it was put to him that Carney had said article 24 was not an option for the UK, he replied: \u201cHe\u2019s wrong in thinking it is not an option. It is certainly an option.\u201d But then Johnson admitted he did not know if that is what Carney had said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I don\u2019t know whether [Carney] said it\u2019s not an option. People are wrong if they say it is not an option ...</p> \n   <p>What you can\u2019t do is unilaterally [have] a Gatt 24 solution. But what you could do is agree with our EU friends and partners to go forwards together on that basis.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Carney has not said that article 24 would not be an option in any circumstances. He has just said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/21/brexit-mark-carney-dismisses-boris-johnson-trade-claim-on-no-deal\">it would not be an option if the UK and the EU were resigned to no-deal.</a> <strong>Henry Newman</strong>, director of the Open Europe thinktank, says Johnson\u2019s article 24 concession is important.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HenryNewman/status/1143443080974077952\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Most important aspects of Boris's interview with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@bbclaurak</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickFerrariLBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NickFerrariLBC</a> is confirmation that GATT 24 cannot be used unilaterally<br><br>This is a significant shift from the position over the weekend</p>\u2014 Henry Newman (@HenryNewman) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HenryNewman/status/1143443080974077952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 25, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But in an interesting Twitter thread starting here, <strong>Ed Conway</strong>, Sky\u2019s economics editor, suggests that article 24 argument is like the \u00a3350m per week claim used during the EU referendum - a bogus assertion that receives plenty of media coverage that benefits the Brexiter cause, even while being refuted by fact-checking journalists.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EdConwaySky/status/1143464297428914182\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thread: When will people realise that with this GATT Article XXIV row we're simply re-running the Vote Leave playbook from the 2016 referendum?

So the challenge for us all in parliament is to get this thing done.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But in his answer Johnson is assuming Conservative and Labour MPs both see the failure to deliver Brexit as an existential threat.

And that is what we need to do.</p> \n   <p>And we can do it through roughly the same approach, which is a big, broad-minded Conservative agenda of investing in education, in infrastructure and technology to close the gaps in society.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson claimed tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were PM.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed that London became more equal in the years he was mayor (from 2008 to 2016) because the poorest families gained most proportionally.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>I will ask Johnson\u2019s campaign what data they have to back up the claim that London became more equal during his mayoralty. The London mayor has very few powers that have a direct impact on household income, and so what happened to income inequality in the capital while he was in charge probably had very little to do with him anyway. But his mayoralty coincided with the financial crash, which saw salaries in the City shrink as bankers lost their bonuses, and sometimes their jobs, and so the figures may well show a reduction in inequality.</p> \n  <p>But Johnson is wrong to imply that lifting national insurance thresholds mainly benefits the lowest paid. It does help the lowest paid, unlike his plan to increase the higher rate tax threshold, but it helps the rich more.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us this evening. You can read my brief summary of the Jeremy Hunt interview here and the more detailed point-by-point takes in the subsequent posts. Or, if you prefer your news in the form of a single, perfectly crafted article, my colleague Jessica Elgot has produced one of those: And here\u2019s the earlier summary of the rest of the day\u2019s developments. And Hunt risks reigniting the row over his views on abortion, refusing to rule out backing moves to cut the legal time limit. He has previously been criticised for arguing in favour of the move at a time when the UK government was facing calls to give women in Northern Ireland the right to an abortion. He says it\u2019s a matter of public record that he voted for the time limit to be reduced from 24 weeks to 12 in 2008, but says he wouldn\u2019t \u201cseek to change the law\u201d as prime minister. He does not, however, rule out backing someone else\u2019s attempts to do so. How I vote in any future private member\u2019s bill would be a matter of conscience and I would have to see what that bill is before I make that decision. Kuenssberg presses Hunt on how he will pay for the significant spending promises he has made. He says he wants to \u201ccut taxes on ordinary people\u201d but still spend vast sums on various social projects. And the only way that you can afford all of those things is to fire up the British economy. And, as someone who set up their own business, I want to help thousands more young people set up their businesses. Let me just give you this one example, Laura: We\u2019re growing at 1.5% a year at the moment. If we were growing at 3% a year, which is the American growth rate, we\u2019d have an extra \u00a320bn to spend on public services or tax cuts. All conservatives want to do both of those things and that\u2019s why my first focus is to really grow the economy. Kuenssberg points out that his corporation tax cut would \u201cprobably be about \u00a313bn\u201d, that he wants to spend an extra \u00a315bn on defence and more money on caring for the elderly. She asks if the no-deal Brexit he\u2019s willing to pursue would not end up costing the treasury yet more money. \u201cWhere are you going to get all that cash from? I mean would you borrow more than Philip Hammond has as Chancellor?\u201d No, I will follow a fiscal rule that is very clear that debt will continue to fall as a proportion of GDP over the cycle and we\u2019ve costed these commitments very very carefully indeed. Hunt adds that he wants to cut corporation tax to \u201cIrish levels\u201d, proposing a levy of 12.5%, rather than the current main rate, which is set at 19%. When they made that move a number of years ago, their GDP per head was lower than ours. Now it\u2019s nearly 50% higher than ours. So, this is the way that we fire up the economy: we create the jobs; we get the money for our precious public services like the NHS; transform our social care system; and find tax cuts. But there is no magic about this. If you don\u2019t create the wealth you can\u2019t spend it. On social care, Hunt says he wants people to begin saving for it as they currently do for their retirement. Well I negotiated a 10-year plan for the NHS and my next job if I\u2019d stayed as health secretary was to a 10-year plan for the social care system. And I do think that councils need more money because I think we want to be a country where we know that as people get older they\u2019re going to be properly looked after. So I think there is a bit of public money. But it\u2019s also about personal responsibility. I think we should be a country where people save for their social care costs, particularly those last few months, possibly years of their life when things can be very uncomfortable, very painful. Just In the same way they save for their pension. I think it should be something that people can opt out of but it should be an automatic thing. Asked if he would cap social care costs \u2013 an issue that caused Theresa May significant damage at the 2017 general election \u2013 he says those who had saved would have their costs capped. I\u2019d do a deal. If you\u2019re prepared to save responsibly during your life, then we will cut those costs. Do the right thing. We need to be a country which rewards people who do the right thing and I think if we do that, if you look at where we were in the post-war period where many people didn\u2019t save for their pensions, we\u2019ve created a society where the majority of people do save for their pensions. That\u2019s the change we need for social care. He does not elaborate on what would happen to those who had not saved, nor does he give any details about the amount that would need to be saved to benefit from the cut in costs, nor how much of a cut would be made. Addressing the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, Hunt says that, while it\u2019s not his preferred option, he would take it if he didn\u2019t think a deal was possible by 31 October \u2013 even though he acknowledges it\u2019d destroy people\u2019s livelihoods. I think that \u201831st of October come hell or high water\u2019 is a fake deadline, because it\u2019s more likely to trip us into a general election before we\u2019ve delivered Brexit, and that would hand the keys to Jeremy Corbyn and then we\u2019d have no Brexit at all. But, in my case, how would I approach this: I think we\u2019ll know very soon well before 31st October if there is a deal to be done along the basis I\u2019ve said. If there isn\u2019t and if no-deal is still on the table, I\u2019ve been very clear: I will leave the European Union without a deal. But I\u2019m not going to do that if there\u2019s a prospect of a better deal and, if I did it, it would be with a heavy heart because businesses up and down the country would face a lot of destruction. I think it\u2019d be very bad for the union, with Scotland where I was at the weekend \u2026 so I would do it though. But as a last resort. Interestingly, Hunt has given himself a significant amount of wiggle-room on the no-deal Brexit question, acknowledging that it may not be \u201con the table\u201d when the 31 October deadline comes around. Any Tory prime minister would be vulnerable to a no-confidence vote and some of the party\u2019s own MPs have already indicated they would vote against it in such an instance if doing so would prevent a no-deal Brexit. Asked about how he can bring together a negotiating team that includes Tories from across the UK, as well as the DUP, who Kuenssberg points out \u201cfundamentally disagree with each other\u201d, Hunt says: Well, this is the big difference between the way I want to handle it and the way we handled it before because, yes, I think there is a deal that can unite all wings of the Conservative party and our friends in the DUP. But it\u2019s got to be different to Theresa May\u2019s deal. We can\u2019t put forward a deal to Brussels unless they absolutely know that it could get through the British parliament. Hunt is asked if his approach \u2013 like that of Johnson \u2013 is not simply \u201csomething that the European Union has said no to on multiple occasions. It\u2019s what Theresa May tried and failed to do many times\u201d. Well, what Theresa May tried to do was a deal involving the backstop. I was in cabinet at the time and I supported her loyally but I never thought that was the right approach. What I\u2019m talking about is a deal that doesn\u2019t involve the backstop as it\u2019s constituted at the moment, so it would be different. Hunt is confronted about his claim he can renegotiate a deal the EU has repeatedly said is not open for renegotiation. He insists, as he has done before, that he\u2019s being given a different message in conversations with European leaders. When I talk to European leaders, what they say is: \u2018look, it\u2019s up to the UK to come up with a solution. But, of course, if you come up with a different solution, something that can work, when we\u2019ll look at the whole package\u2019. Hunt\u2019s claim is led some credence by the admission that Germany is ready to listen to ideas on how to solve the backstop problem. It\u2019s perhaps worth pointing out, however, that what Germany did not say is that it\u2019s willing to back down on the overall object of the backstop: preventing a hard border. Asked what he would change to that end, Hunt acknowledges his plan is similar to that of his opponent. It would be changing the backstop with some guarantees that we\u2019re not going to have a hard border on the island of Ireland for completely obvious reasons. That approach is not too different to what Boris wants. I think it\u2019ll be a technology-led solution. What, exactly, that \u201ctechnology-led solution\u201d entails remains something of a mystery, however, as Hunt is short on details in the interview on how he actually sees it working. He says: I think everyone thinks that, within the next decade, we aren\u2019t going to have big border checks when it comes to goods because we\u2019re going to do all these things online, just like the rest of our lives is transformed. And that discussion is what do you do if there\u2019s a disagreement about what technology can do, so you need some mechanisms that resolve those disputes. While Germany is ready to discuss options, the EU has rejected the idea that solely technological means can effectively replace border checks. In the interview, however, Hunt says he thinks that very solution \u201cis ready\u201d to be put in place right away and that he believes the bloc has simply been unwilling thus far to discuss it because it wants to keep the UK in the customs union. But I think they know now that won\u2019t get through Parliament. So what I\u2019m saying is let\u2019s not be negative, let\u2019s not be pessimistic. There is a way we can do this but what we have to do is send the right prime minister to Brussels to have those negotiations, have those open discussions and then I think there is a deal to be done. In his interview with the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, Hunt returns again and again to the question of character, insisting he can be trusted to negotiate a deal with the EU. Boris and I want to change that deal and the judgement is: who is the person we trust as PM to go to Brussels and bring back that deal? It\u2019s about the personality of our PM. If you choose someone where there\u2019s no trust, there\u2019s going to be no negotiation, no deal. And, quite possibly, a general election, which could mean we have no Brexit either. If you choose someone that the other side will talk to who\u2019s going to be very tough, there will least be in negotiation and I believe this deal to be done. The significance of this approach \u2013 particularly at a time when his opponent has been facing so many questions about his own temperament and attention to detail \u2013 is difficult to overstate. Hunt, however, tries to play it down. Asked if he thinks Johnson would be an untrustworthy prime minister, he says: I would never make those comments about a fellow candidate. I would serve Boris Johnson to the very best of my ability and make his prime ministership a success and I hope he\u2019d do the same for me. It\u2019s pointed out that it\u2019s somewhat implausible \u2013 in a two-horse race \u2013 to suggest he is not casting Johnson as untrustworthy. He responds: No I\u2019m saying I am trustworthy and I do believe that I can be trusted to deliver this deal. He\u2019s also asked how he can be trusted by the EU, given that he caused a major row when he compared the bloc to the Soviet Union last year. He says: I am not afraid to speak uncomfortable truths to our partners in the EU. The point I made in that speech was it was totally inappropriate for an organisation that was set up to defend freedom to make it impossible for a member to leave. I will say tough things when I need to say tough things. But I\u2019ll also preserve the relationship. I think I\u2019ve also shown as foreign secretary that I can have good links with European countries. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m the right person to deliver Brexit. In a week in which his opponent, Boris Johnson, has faced serious questions about his fitness for office, Jeremy Hunt has sought to place temperament and competence at the forefront of the debate in an interview with BBC that has just aired. Here\u2019s a brief summary of the lengthy exchange. I\u2019ll put together more detailed posts on each soon: Hunt seeks to portray himself as the candidate who could be trusted in negotiations with the European Union. The foreign secretary insists he could renegotiate the deal \u2013 despite the EU\u2019s consistent assertions it will not be reopened \u2013 and says he would have the DUP on the negotiating team. He says the backstop would be removed because he would commit to not having a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The solution would be technology-led, he says and, crucially, he insists this is ready to be implemented \u201cnow\u201d. But he doesn\u2019t give any specifics on what the plan actually entails in practice. If he feels there\u2019s no possibility of getting a deal done as 31 October approaches, he will leave with no deal f that option is \u201cstill on the table\u201d at that point. Moving beyond Brexit, he says people should be saving throughout their lives to cover some of the costs of their social care later. And he says he would take steps to cut costs for those people \u2013 and those people only. And, potentially reigniting criticism of his views on abortion, he admitted he might support moves to cut the legal time limit but would not seek to change the law himself. Boris Johnson has pledged that the UK will leave the European Union on 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d, as he promised to push for a no-deal Brexit if this was needed to meet the departure deadline. He has also challenged Jeremy Hunt, his opponent in the Tory leadership contest, to match his pledge. (See 4.42pm.) Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to say whether his campaign team passed a photograph of him and his partner to newspapers as a PR strategy during a radio interview which saw the Tory leadership frontrunner quizzed again about his personal life. Gordon Brown has said the unity of the United Kingdom has never been at greater risk, faced by the \u201chijacking of patriotism\u201d by Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage and, what the former prime minister said was a shift by the Scottish National party towards a more extreme nationalism. Germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said. Boris Johnson has been filmed at a private garden party telling Conservative members that the NHS absolutely needs to be reformed, as he fired them up for a general election by asking them to be ready to \u201cwallop Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, has defended the neighbours of Boris Johnson\u2019s partner after they recorded the couple having a row and reported it to the police. Jeremy Hunt has been accused of trying to boost his Conservative leadership campaign by withdrawing Foreign Office (FCO) support for Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s overseas visits. MPs have condemned The Jeremy Kyle Show as a forum for tearing participants apart in a \u201cRoman Colosseum-type way\u201d, as ITV executives tried to defend the treatment of participants on hit reality shows including Love Island. The UK is suspending future sales of teargas and other crowd control equipment to Hong Kong until an independent investigation is held into allegations of police brutality during mass protests earlier this month. From the Mail\u2019s John Stevens John McDonnell has said he is \u201carguing the case\u201d for Labour to support remain if there is a second referendum on Brexit. Address the Society for Motor Manufacturers &amp; Traders summit in London, the shadow chancellor said the Brexit situation was \u201ca complete mess\u201d. He said: The situation is deteriorating rather than getting better. My big concern is that in the Tory leadership election both candidates have kept no-deal on the table. No-deal, as far as I\u2019m concerned, I think it will be catastrophic. It\u2019s a bloody mess, it\u2019s a complete mess. What we are trying to do now is seeing whether or not there is a route through all of this. The discussion we are having in the Labour party now \u2026 is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum. I\u2019ve said personally, I\u2019d vote for remain, I campaigned for remain because I can\u2019t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards. He said Labour policy would \u201cevolve over the next week\u201d because further talks were taking place. Asked later if Jeremy Corbyn would be campaigning for remain, McDonnell replied: \u201cWell, I\u2019m arguing the case\u201d. He also said Corbyn as a leader was \u201ca consensus builder\u201d and that he would arrive at a decision after the consultation was over in the next week or so. And here is Jeremy Hunt\u2019s reply to Boris Johnson. (See 4.42pm.) Ever since he launched his campaign for the Tory leadership Boris Johnson has been saying that he is committed to taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October. But there have been various hints along the way that this might be a promise that he does not expect to keep. At his campaign launch he refused to say he would resign if the UK did not leave by his deadline. A few days later, in an interview for the World at One, he said that it would be wrong \u201cat this stage\u201d to signal a willingness to delay again. At a meeting with business leaders, although Johnson said that he would go for a no-deal if necessary to meet the October deadline, some in the audience concluded he did not mean it. And last week the Evening Standard, edited by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne, said it was backing Johnson for party leader because it thought he would be more flexible on Brexit than any of the other candidates and because he had not \u201cguaranteed\u201d (it judged) Brexit by 31 October. Well, now Johnson is firmly guaranteeing Brexit by 31 October. This morning in an interview he said it was a \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment for him (see 2.11pm) and he has now released an open letter to Jeremy Hunt challenging him to commit, with Johnson, to ruling out any further extension. Johnson firms up his commitment to delivering Brexit by 31 October and challenges Hunt to do the same. He also challenges Hunt to join him in firmly ruling out a second referendum. He says whether or not Brexit happens by 31 October is \u201cthe central issue\u201d of the leadership campaign. Why is Johnson doing this? Conservative party members are to a large extent hardline Brexiters (some 60% of them said they were going to vote for the Brexit party in the European elections, according to one survey) and this is about the one aspect of Brexit policy where Johnson\u2019s policy is clearly different from Hunt\u2019s, because he has refused to rule out a further extension. Otherwise their Brexit plans are very similar, although Hunt claims he is better placed to deliver it because EU leaders trust him, and Johnson claims he is better placed to deliver it because he voted leave in 2016. Gordon Brown\u2019s speech this morning to the Fabian Society/Hope Not Hate is, like most Brown speeches, well worth a read. My colleague Ben Quinn has written it up here, but here are some lengthy extracts which deserved a wider audience. The full text does not seem to be available on the web. Brown said Boris Johnson as prime minister would exploit English nationalism to secure a Tory election victory \u2013 putting the future of the United Kingdom at risk. He said: Unless [Johnson] specifically rules it out, he will almost certainly \u2013 and under the influence of his election guru \u2013 play the \u2018English card\u2019, whipping up English nationalistic fervour against Scotland for English votes that put at risk the union itself. If the precedent was set by David Cameron with his posters of the Labour leader in the pocket of the Scottish first minister, think of a similar Lynton Crosby campaign for Johnson \u2013 the claim that a Corbyn minority government, dependent on SNP votes, would grant another independence referendum to the SNP. It is right to warn of the SNP\u2019s obsession with independence. It is right, too, for us to remind Labour that as a party of the union it can never and must never make a backdoor deal with the SNP. But of course, that\u2019s not the point of the Crosby-Johnson exercise: their interest is not that the SNP or Labour have the best policies in the national interest: their aim is to whip up English nationalist fervour against Scotland simply to secure a Tory victory \u2013 and even at the cost of harming the union. Brown said Johnson was opposed to the principles that underpin the union. He said: Boris Johnson is not just defining his patriotism as being anti-European. Look at what he has written on the union \u2013 not in the heat of the moment during a referendum, but continuously over 20 years. What his writing adds up to is a manifesto vehemently opposing the three constitutional pillars upon which today\u2019s union is built: Scottish representation in the UK parliament, Scottish devolution and Scottish funding. First, representation: he believes that that the number of Scottish MPs in the UK parliament should be substantially reduced. Unable to understand careful care has to be taken in any union \u2013 whether the USA, Germany or Australia \u2013 when considering the representation of minorities, he continues to argue that Scotland is grossly overrepresented at Westminster. When it comes to the devolution settlement, he would curtail the Scottish parliament making their own decisions in devolved areas such as universities and social care. And he also opposes as \u201creckless\u201d and \u201cunfair to England\u201d the financial linchpin of the union \u2013 the 40-year-old UK-wide settlement, the Barnett formula \u2013 which allocates resources by taking account of differing needs and changing demography across the four nations of the UK. And if the Scots were in dire need he would have an answer: \u201cI propose that we tell them to hop it.\u201d The SNP think of him as their best recruiting sergeant for independence. And, not surprisingly, few Scots believe the union is safe in his hands, fearing whether through ignorance, carelessness or malice he will be prepared to play fast and loose with the union when it suits his personal electoral needs. Johnson, of course, would dispute this. Recently Nicola Sturgeon said he had jokingly floated the idea of offering Scotland full fiscal autonomy. Brown said the United Kingdom needed more than just four nationalisms to survive. But Scottish nationalism plus English nationalism plus Welsh nationalism plus Ulster nationalism does not add up to a United Kingdom. Four nations united only by nationalism will not sustain the United Kingdom. It means a house divided that cannot stand for long. He criticised Nigel Farage\u2019s style of nationalism. If Britain is seen by us not just as traditionally tolerant and fair-minded but as outward looking, what do we find in the Farage brand of nationalism? A Britain that for him is glorying in isolation, viewing every institution with the word \u201cEuropean\u201d or \u201cglobal\u201d in its title as \u201cthe enemy\u201d or as hostile territory. So where does this intolerant, divisive, inward-looking nationalism take us? It leads us exactly where divisive continental nationalisms led us in the past \u2013 to targeting and then blaming and demonising immigrants, foreigners and anyone who stands in the Farage way \u2013 and, of course, using language designed to induce uncertainty, fear and discord, rebutting any criticisms and countering any arguments with the now familiar trademark accusations of \u201cbetrayal\u201d. Brown argued for an alternative form of patriotism. You can love your country without being made to feel you ever have to hate your neighbour. He claimed the SNP were now pushing for a more extreme form of independence than in 2014. In the 2014 Scottish referendum the nationalists proposed leaving the UK political union but said they wanted to keep the UK pound and to stay inside the UK custom union and the UK single market. Now they are committed to a wholly separate Scottish pound and to abandon, in a quiet, almost furtive way the UK customs union and single market which has given us tariff-free, tension-free trade across the four nations for 300 years and prevented what now seems inevitable under independence: a hard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall separating Scotland and England and life reduced to an unending battle between us and them. This is an ingenious argument, but not a wholly fair one. In 2014 the Scottish government did not have a straightforward currency policy, because the UK parties rejected its call for a currency union, and this became a big problem for the yes campaign. Now the SNP has agreed that Scotland should have its own currency as soon as possible after independence, but the notion of a \u201chard border at Hadrian\u2019s Wall\u201d is Brown spin. He said citizens\u2019 assemblies could help build a more informed democracy. Even now there may be a way to reset our relationships with the world: recognising that trust has broken down because, in our representative democracies, political parties are no longer performing their traditional role of assembling and then aggregating public opinion to build an informed consensus. And in their place, Facebook, Twitter and our social media give a spurious impression of direct democracy as if leaders and led are communicating with each other on equal terms. However, at its best the internet promotes a shouting match without an umpire and, at worst, an echo chamber isolating and reverberating the most extremist of views. So we should attempt to build a more informed democracy through region-by-region public hearings \u2013 what in Ireland were called citizens\u2019 assemblies \u2013 where we encourage an honest debate on all the specific options for our future. Here is the video of Boris Johnson talking about his secret model bus-making habit. Judging by social media, some people seem to find this account of how Johnson relaxes even less plausible than his Brexit plan \u2026 At Foreign Office questions in the Commons this morning Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, cracked a joke about Boris Johnson\u2019s late-night row with his girlfriend on Thursday last week. Addressing Jeremy Hunt, she said: It gives me an opportunity to congratulate the foreign secretary directly, not just for being in the final two, getting into the final two, but also being the only candidate who has the police outside his house for the right reasons. (Being foreign secretary is one of the few cabinet jobs that comes with 24-hour police protection.) Boris Johnson is campaigning this afternoon in Surrey, according to his team. These are from the Daily Mirror\u2019s Pippa Crerar and PoliticsHome\u2019s Kevin Schofield on today\u2019s shadow cabinet meeting. Here are the main points from Boris Johnson\u2019s two radio appearances this morning, on LBC and on TalkRadio. Johnson, the favourite in the Tory leadership contest, downgraded his commitment to cutting taxes for the wealthy, saying that he would prioritise tax cuts that would help the poor. (See 11.38am.) But he did not disavow the plan to lift the rate at which people start paying the higher rate of tax to \u00a380,000, a policy that have proved hugely controversial because it would give \u00a39bn to people who are mostly in the richest 10%. He described delivering Brexit by 31 October as a \u201cdo or die\u201d commitment. He told TalkRadio the UK would leave by then under his premiership \u201ccome what may\u201d. When he was asked if that meant \u201cdo or die\u201d, Johnson replied: \u201cDo or die. Come what may.\u201d He also came closer than ever before to saying he would resign if he did not deliver Brexit by the end of October. At his official campaign launch two weeks ago he notably dodged the question when asked if he would resign if the UK were still in the EU by November. But today, when asked that question, he replied: I think that it follows from everything that I\u2019ve said, that I think politics is at a crossroads in this country. He claimed government \u201cdefeatism\u201d under Theresa May had been partly to blame for the UK not achieving Brexit. Claiming that his own optimism about Brexit would help to secure a deal, he said: I think a bit of positive energy would help, frankly. I\u2019ve never seen such morosity and gloom from a government. For three years we\u2019ve been sitting around wrapped in defeatism telling the British public that they can\u2019t do this or that. It is pathetic, it\u2019s absolutely pathetic. He said that he wanted to agree a new withdrawal agreement with the EU. He said that the current withdrawal agreement would need to go, but that he would want to keep some aspects of it. When asked if that meant he would be pushing for changes to the withdrawal agreement text, and not just changes to the political declaration (the accompanying text, covering the future relationship), Johnson said: [We need] more than a change. It\u2019s got to be, you know, we need a new withdrawal agreement. If we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement. The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, explained its position for the umpteenth time after last week\u2019s EU summit when he said: We are open for talks when it comes to the declaration on the future UK-EU relations if the position of the United Kingdom were to evolve, but the withdrawal agreement is not open for renegotiation. Johnson admitted that the UK would not be able to use article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt) to carry on tariff-free trade with the EU unilaterally in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Some Brexiters have implied that article 24 means the UK has nothing to fear from a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson himself suggested as much in the BBC debate last week. But today he was more circumspect. When asked if Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, was right to say article 24 would not apply in a no-deal situation, Johnson told LBC: Well, he\u2019s right in the sense that Gatt article 24 paragraph males it perfectly clear that two countries that are in the process of beginning a free trade agreement may protract their existing arrangements until such time as they have completed any free trade agreement. And that\u2019s a very hopeful prospect. That is the way forward ... Where Mark is right is saying that implies mutuality, there has to be agreement on both sides. Johnson also admitted there had been \u201csome confusion\u201d about article 24. When it was put to him that Carney had said article 24 was not an option for the UK, he replied: \u201cHe\u2019s wrong in thinking it is not an option. It is certainly an option.\u201d But then Johnson admitted he did not know if that is what Carney had said: I don\u2019t know whether [Carney] said it\u2019s not an option. People are wrong if they say it is not an option ... What you can\u2019t do is unilaterally [have] a Gatt 24 solution. But what you could do is agree with our EU friends and partners to go forwards together on that basis. Carney has not said that article 24 would not be an option in any circumstances. He has just said it would not be an option if the UK and the EU were resigned to no-deal. Henry Newman, director of the Open Europe thinktank, says Johnson\u2019s article 24 concession is important. But in an interesting Twitter thread starting here, Ed Conway, Sky\u2019s economics editor, suggests that article 24 argument is like the \u00a3350m per week claim used during the EU referendum - a bogus assertion that receives plenty of media coverage that benefits the Brexiter cause, even while being refuted by fact-checking journalists. Johnson appeared to criticise Mark Carney\u2019s understanding of the article 24 process - before admitting Carney might not have said what he implied he did. Johnson claimed that he would have a better chance of getting a Brexit deal through parliament than Theresa May because both main parties are terrified of what might happen to them if Brexit does not happen. Asked on LBC why he could succeed where May failed, he said: Politics has totally changed since March 29. We are staring down the barrel of defeat. Look at what happened in the European elections, in the council elections. My party, the Conservative party, was on 9% in the European elections. Every Tory MP understands that. And it is not as though Labour are doing that much better. They\u2019ve got the Liberal Democrats ahead of them ... So the challenge for us all in parliament is to get this thing done. But in his answer Johnson is assuming Conservative and Labour MPs both see the failure to deliver Brexit as an existential threat. This ignores the fact that many Labour MPs would be delighted to see Brexit abandoned, and while most Tory MPs accept the need for Brexit to happen, there is a profound split between those who think no-deal is acceptable and those who don\u2019t. Johnson revived his threat to without money from the EU as a means of getting a deal - although he reframed this as \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d. Explaining what he would do, he told LBC: Then what you\u2019ve got to do is look at the money, which is at the high end of [the EU\u2019s] expectations, \u00a339bn. And I think we need a bit of creative ambiguity about when and how much of that money is going to be paid, and what kind of deal it would be payable for. This seems a slightly milder way of expressing a threat he first raised in a Sunday Times interview earlier this month. He criticised Jeremy Hunt, his rival, as someone who would \u201csimply kick the can down the road\u201d on Brexit. He told LBC: There is one candidate standing in this contest who represents a fresh way of actually getting us out of the mire and who will deliver Brexit on October the 31st. I\u2019m afraid the other candidate who is standing would simply kick the can down the road. Johnson refused to say whether his campaign team passed a photograph of him and his partner to newspapers as a PR strategy during a radio interview which saw the Tory leadership frontrunner quizzed again about his personal life. He described claims that that he has been taking advice from Steve Bannon, the far-right former Trump aide, as \u201ccodswallop\u201d. Referring to an Observer story about this, Johnson said: This is the biggest load of codswallop I have ever heard. Asked if he and Bannon exchange text messages regularly, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d he went on: I have met Mr Bannon in the White House when he was chief of staff to the president as you would expect, in the course of my duties as foreign secretary ... It is perfectly true that when the president came to this country last year Steve Bannon texted me on a couple of occasions trying to fix a meeting. I texted back to say that meeting was not possible. That was the \u201csum total\u201d of their exchanges, he said. But he went on: And yet this is turned by people who wish to stop me from achieving what I want to achieve into some crazy kind of alt-right conspiracy involving me and Steve Bannon. Anybody who looks at my record knows that I\u2019m a progressive, modern Conservative. The problem with Johnson\u2019s attempt to blame the Observer is that it is Bannon himself who has been claiming that he influenced what Johnson said in the speech he gave last year after he resigned from cabinet. Johnson\u2019s answer was striking because it showed just how horrified he is by association with the extreme right - even though in his new role as a hardline Brexiter he is picking up support from Tories who were never fans of the liberal, metropolitan conservatism he used to champion earlier in his career. Johnson said he backed calls for the recruitment of an extra 20,000 police officers - although he refused to say when they would be hired if he were PM. He said two principles should apply to reform of adult social care: that no one should have to face the threat of losing their home to pay for care; and that everyone should have dignity in old age. He claimed that he relaxes by making model buses. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader and arch-Brexiter, has been appointed chair of the Boris Johnson campaign, it has just announced. Germany will fight to the last hour to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal and is willing to hear any fresh ideas for the Irish border backstop, the country\u2019s ambassador to the UK has said. Speaking at the car manufacturers summit in London, Peter Wittig said Germany cherished its relationship with the UK and was ready to talk about solutions the new prime minister might have over the Irish border. My country is ready to talk, and chancellor [Angela Merkel] once said she would be willing to talk to the last hour not to have a no-deal scenario. It\u2019s a mindset. We are not giving up on achieving an orderly Brexit. Germany has been a very pragmatic voice in this whole tortuous Brexit process and we will continue to be that. Even if we have a short window while the new prime minister is in place, we will welcome any idea how to solve that famous backstop issue and we will be willing to work towards a negotiated deal which is long term the only viable and sensible option for Europe. Asked later if Germany would support another extension in the Brexit process, Wittig said: We can\u2019t be more specific. It is now the turn of the UK government to come up with the plan and talk to us [the EU]. Our mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal. The Conservative party has just sent out this press release saying that the winner of the leadership contest will be announced on Tuesday 23 July. It says: Following the first membership hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, there will be 15 more taking place across every region and nation of the UK over the next four weeks. In addition, a digital hustings will be held on Wednesday 26 June. This will be open to questions from the public ensuring non-members get the opportunity to put questions to the future leader of the Conservative party. The digital hustings will be hosted by freelance journalist Hannah Vaughan Jones and will be live-streamed on the Conservative party\u2019s Facebook and Twitter accounts. Conservative party members should receive postal ballots between 6 and 8 July. This ballot will close at 5pm on Monday 22 July. The Rt Hon Dame Cheryl Gillan DBE MP and Charles Walker OBE MP will be the returning officers for the membership vote. The announcement of the next leader of the Conservative party will be made on Tuesday 23 July. This process has been agreed with both candidates. Jeremy Hunt, Boris Johnson\u2019s rival in the Tory leadership contests, says he will take questions from people on Twitter this evening as a substitute for the debate that Sky News was planning to hold but which got cancelled because Johnson would not attend. The most unusual revelation from the two Boris Johnson interviews we\u2019ve had this morning came in the TalkRadio one, where Ross Kempsell asked Johnson what he did to relax. Johnson said that he painted, and that he liked making models of buses. He explained: I get old wooden crates \u2026 and I paint them and they have to contain two wine bottles. And it will have a dividing thing. And I turn it into a bus and \u2026 I paint the passengers enjoying themselves. Boris Johnson has also given an interview to TalkRadio in which he said getting Britain out of the EU by 31 October was a \u201cdo or die, come what may\u201d commitment for him. A full summary of everything in the LBC and TalkRadio interviews is coming soon. Here is Jeremy Corbyn on Boris Johnson\u2019s tax policies. Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies has published a report saying that Boris Johnson\u2019s promise to cut taxes for millions of higher earners would cost \u00a39bn and benefit the richest 10% of households in Britain most. This was a promise that Johnson first unveiled in his Daily Telegraph column, which was written up by the paper as a front-page splash. Johnson has also proposed raising the threshold for paying national insurance \u2013 although, up to now, his campaign has not stressed this plan as much, and he has not said what the new threshold would be. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary who was also a leadership contender before being eliminated in the MPs\u2019 ballot, said the threshold should rise to \u00a312,500, and Johnson has not ruled this out as a target. The IFS says this policy would cost at least \u00a311bn. The full IFS report is here (pdf), and its summary is here. When Boris Johnson was asked in his LBC interview about the IFS saying his tax plans would cost up to \u00a320bn, Johnson said he did not accept the figures. He replied: I don\u2019t recognise those figures. Those aren\u2019t the figures that I have seen. Then he went on to claim that tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were prime minister. He said: We will bring forward a tax proposal, a package, that actually begins by lifting thresholds for those on lowest pay. I just remind you that when I was mayor \u2026 we massively expanded the London living wage. We put millions of pounds in the pockets of some of the poorest families in our cities, and we brought the city together. And what I want to do as prime minister, if I\u2019m lucky enough to serve, is to bring the whole of the country together. And if you look at what happened in London over those two terms, it was the poorest families who saw the biggest increases in life expectancy and in their prosperity. And that is what we need to do. And we can do it through roughly the same approach, which is a big, broad-minded Conservative agenda of investing in education, in infrastructure and technology to close the gaps in society. Johnson claimed tax cuts for the poor would take priority over tax cuts for the wealthy if he were PM. He claimed that London became more equal in the years he was mayor (from 2008 to 2016) because the poorest families gained most proportionally. I will ask Johnson\u2019s campaign what data they have to back up the claim that London became more equal during his mayoralty. The London mayor has very few powers that have a direct impact on household income, and so what happened to income inequality in the capital while he was in charge probably had very little to do with him anyway. But his mayoralty coincided with the financial crash, which saw salaries in the City shrink as bankers lost their bonuses, and sometimes their jobs, and so the figures may well show a reduction in inequality. But Johnson is wrong to imply that lifting national insurance thresholds mainly benefits the lowest paid. It does help the lowest paid, unlike his plan to increase the higher rate tax threshold, but it helps the rich more. As the IFS report (pdf) says, \u201cthe largest proportional gains [from this policy] go to those in the middle to upper part of the income distribution.\u201d This is what political journalists and commentators are saying about the Boris Johnson LBC phone-in. From Business Insider\u2019s Adam Bienkov From LBC\u2019s Matthew Thompson From Sky\u2019s Adam Boulton From my colleague Peter Walker From my colleague John Crace From the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges From HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh From my colleague Jessica Elgot From the Economist\u2019s Anne McElvoy The Mirror\u2019s Dan Bloom has a transcript of the extract from the phone-in where Boris Johnson was refusing to answer questions about the row with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, and the photo released to the media intended to show that they were reconciled. Britain\u2019s most senior police officer, Cressida Dick, has defended the neighbours of Boris Johnson\u2019s partner after they recorded the couple having a row and reported it to the police, my colleague Matthew Weaver reports. The phone-in over-ran by about five minutes. In the closing section, Johnson criticised Jeremy Hunt, claiming that on Brexit Hunt\u2019s policy just amounted to kicking the can down the road. He also confirmed that in the past he had tried class A drugs. And that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll post reaction and a summary shortly. Q: Is it true you have taken advice from Steve Bannon, the far-right former Trump adviser? Johnson describes this story as \u201ccodswallop\u201d. He says when Bannon came to the UK last year, he texted a couple of times to try to arrange a meeting. But Johnson did not agree to a meeting. Johnson dismisses the suggestion that Bannon was giving him advice on what to do. He says he is a \u201cprogressive, modern Conservative\u201d. Johnson dismisses reports that he has taken advice from Steve Bannon as \u201ccodswallop\u201d. Q: What do you say about the Institute for Fiscal Studies analysis of the cost of your tax plan? Johnson says he does not recognise the IFS figures. He says his priority would be lifting the national insurance threshold. This would help the lower paid, he suggests. Johnson refuses to accept the IFS critique of his tax plan. He appears to downgrade his commitment to raising the threshold for paying the higher rate of tax, saying his priority instead would be to lift the national insurance threshold. Q: Can you promise that some of the Brexit bonus money going to the NHS goes to dementia services? Johnson says \u201cof course\u201d he stands by the claim Brexit will release \u00a3350m a week for the NHS. He says he accepts that there should be more dementia funding. But there needs to be national consensus about how to do it. He says the Tory 2017 election manifesto proposal on social care was a \u201cdisaster\u201d. He said there was not time to explain it properly. He says two principles should apply. First, no one should face the threat of losing their home. Second, everyone should have dignity in old age. Q: Should LGBT education continue in schools? Johnson says people should be able to love who they want. He says he does not approve of children being taken out of school to miss these lessons. Johnson is now defending his previous record. He says the Garden Bridge idea was a good one, and could have gone ahead with private funding. And he says the Iranians are to blame for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe\u2019s detention. Criticising him lets them off the hook, he suggests. Johnson is now on Brexit. He says \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d is needed over when the UK will pay the \u00a339bn to the EU. On the backstop, he says there is no need for a hard border in Ireland. He says the Alternative Arrangements Commission report out yesterday on alternatives to this was \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Q: And you think Ireland will accept this? Yes, says Johnson. Q: And how will the UK and Ireland trade in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Won\u2019t the GATT rules apply? Johnson says article 24 would allow both sides to continue with existing prospects. Q: Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, says that is wrong. Johnson says Carney was right to say that this would have to be mutually agreed. It is right to say that the UK cannot unilaterally go for this. But it would be an option if both sides agreed, he says. He says it would be \u201cvery bizarre\u201d if the EU decided to impose tariffs. It would be a return to the Napoleonic system. Johnson insists article 24 of GATT could be used to allow the UK and the EU to continue tariff-free trade after Brexit. He suggests Mark Carney\u2019s objections to this have been over-interpreted. Johnson said he backed Sajid Javid\u2019s plan to hire 20,000 more police officers. But he refused to set a timetable for when they might arrive. Johnson backs proposal to hire 20,000 more police officers. Nick Ferrari says Boris Johnson has been described as a coward for not doing interviews. Q: Are you a coward? Johnson says he has a maxim in life, and in politics, nicked from Ronald Reagon, never speak ill of a fellow Conservative. He will not reply to attacks like this, he says. Johnson refuses to respond to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s claim he is a coward. He says both main parties are losing votes. Unless they deliver Brexit, \u201cour generation will not be forgiven.\u201d Q: Why have you dodged tonight\u2019s debate [the planned Sky one]? Johnson says he is doing 16 hustings, and he has done some with Jeremy Hunt already. Q: You are an experienced journalist and editor. Are you saying your private life is not of interest? \u201cOf course things may be of interest,\u201d he says. He understands that. Johnson accepts his private life is of interest to the media. Q: As Guardian editor, would you have run that story. Johnson says he won\u2019t comment \u201con the integrity or discretion of the editor of the Guardian\u201d. He says, as soon as he answers questions like this, he brings his family into the limelight. He refuses to criticise the Guardian for running the story about his row with his girlfriend which was so loud it led to neighbours calling the police. Q: So why the picture today? Johnson tries to change the subject. \u201cThe longer we spend on things ...\u201d He refuses to say where the picture came from. He claims not to have seen most of today\u2019s front pages. Q: But you knew the picture was being put out there? Johnson says there are all sorts of pictures of him on the internet that pop up from time to time. Q: Did you know this picture was out there? Johnson says he knew that picture was out there. Q: So when was it taken? Johnson refuses to say. Q: It is not recent, is it? Johnson says this conversation is \u201cdescending into farce\u201d. Q: This is an old picture, isn\u2019t it? Johnson refuses to say. But he says he no longer has his hair cut by the \u201cTurkish chap\u201d. Q: So this is at least six weeks old? Johnson refuses to comment. Johnson refuses to deny that his team supplied a picture of himself and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, to the media that was intended to show they were reconciled following their row on Thursday night. The Evening Standard put the picture on its front page yesterday, saying that it was taken after the row and that it was intended to quash reports Johnson and Symonds were close to breaking up. But today Johnson refused to deny claims the photograph was several weeks old. Boris Johnson is about to start a half-hour LBC phone-in, hosted by Nick Ferrari. Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, has been giving a speech this morning saying that, if Boris Johnson were to become prime minister, the United Kingdom could break up. He has written a preview of what he will be saying in the Daily Mail, and I will cover more from the speech later. After weeks of maintaining a low profile, Boris Johnson, the clear favourite in the Tory leadership contest, is now starting to speak out a bit more and last night he gave a major interview to the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. You can read our write-up here, the BBC\u2019s write-up here, and the full transcript here. And you can watch the whole interview here. I will be writing more about it later, as well as covering what Johnson says in his LBC phone-in at 9.30am. This morning Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and a Jeremy Hunt supporter, told the Today programme that Johnson had not done enough to persuade people he had a convincing plan to deliver Brexit. She said: This is an incredibly difficult situation and Boris needs to explain how he will deal with both sides of the Conservative party that have concerns and try and break the impasse with the European Union. Enthusiasm and optimism is not sufficient. My colleague Peter Walker has more on Rudd\u2019s interview here. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson takes part in an LBC phone-in. 9.30am: Theresa May chairs cabinet. 9.45am: Jeremy Corbyn chairs shadow cabinet. 10.30am: ITV and Jeremy Kyle Show executives give evidence to the Commons culture committee about reality TV. 12.50pm: Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, gives a speech at the Centre for Policy Studies\u2019 annual Margaret Thatcher conference. 2.30pm: Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, Stephen Hammond, a health minister, and Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, give evidnce to the Commons health committee. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime, and another when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members. Johnson\u2019s camp insist it would be part of a wider \u2013 and so far unknown \u2013 package of tax changes.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Public spending</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has said relatively little, beyond promising a fairly small increase in schools funding, as well as talking about the need to roll out fast broadband across the country. Johnson has generally hinted he would loosen the purse strings, but given his prior fondness for big-ticket projects \u2013 London\u2019s cancelled garden bridge, the mooted 'Boris island' airport \u2013 perhaps expect more of a focus on infrastructure projects than services.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Climate and environment</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This is unlikely to be a big issue for Conservative party members, and Johnson has not said much on this beyond confirming his general support for the new government target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to a net zero by 2050.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Foreign policy</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Also unlikely to be a big issue among Tory members, beyond vague platitudes on 'global Britain', it could be a weak spot for Johnson given his poor performance as foreign secretary.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has hardened his position on leaving the EU \u201cdo or die\u201d by the end of October, as hardline Eurosceptics extended their influence on his faltering campaign to be prime minister. The frontrunner toughened his Brexit stance as criticism continued over his refusal to answer questions about a police visit to his flat following a loud late-night altercation with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. In a round of interviews designed to put the focus back on his EU policy and away from his personal life, Johnson appeared to signal there was an increasing prospect of a no-deal Brexit three months after he would take office. Johnson first doubled down on his commitment to leaving on 31 October in an interview with Talkradio, saying he was in no way reneging on his firm pledge. \u201cWe are getting ready to come out on 31 October. Come what may,\u201d he said. Asked to confirm this, he added: \u201cDo or die. Come what may.\u201d He then said he would scrap Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement and seek a completely new deal before then, as minor changes would not satisfy him. \u201cI mean more than a change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be, we need a new withdrawal agreement \u2013 if we\u2019re going to go out on the basis of a withdrawal agreement.\u201d Not only has the EU said it will not reopen the withdrawal agreement, but the timetable would be extremely tight as parliament is in recess over the summer and then sitting for about 10 days before party conference season begins. MPs return midway through October, just a few weeks before the deadline. Johnson then emphasised his position on leaving by 31 October yet again by writing a letter to Jeremy Hunt, his Tory leadership opponent, challenging him to commit to that date \u201ccome what may\u201d. Hunt replied with a dig that Johnson could find out his policy if he turned up to a Sky News head-to-head debate on Tuesday night that Johnson has refused to attend. \u201cHi Boris, it\u2019s good to talk. But no need for snail-mail, why not turn up to Sky tonight and I\u2019ll give you full and frank answers?#BoJoNoShow,\u201d he tweeted. Hunt also tried to claim his Brexit policy was similar to Johnson\u2019s but that he would be a more trusted negotiator to deliver changes that could get through the UK parliament. \u201cWho is the person that we trust to send to Brussels on behalf of the British people and come back with a deal, and that has to be someone that they trust, that they\u2019re prepared to talk to, because in the end you don\u2019t do a deal with someone you don\u2019t trust,\u201d Hunt told the BBC in an interview. In fact, Hunt\u2019s stance is more moderate than that of his rival as he has not committed to leaving on 31 October if he needs more time to do a deal. Johnson also wants to throw out the withdrawal agreement for a new one, while Hunt would be seeking more modest tweaks. In another sign that Johnson\u2019s campaign was taking a more hardline turn, he appointed Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran Eurosceptic and former Tory leader, as his campaign chief.

In overcast conditions Essex started the day by losing their last four second-innings wickets for 19 runs, before tearing into Somerset. Other than Lewis Gregory, whose 34-ball 40 \u2013 ended by a Beard delivery that snapped a stump and smashed a bail \u2013 included three successive sixes off Simon Harmer, no batsman shone, with James Hildreth and Tom Banton the only others to reach double figures in the leaders\u2019 second knock. \u201cWe were completely outplayed and didn\u2019t deserve anything from the game,\u201d said Tom Abell, the Somerset captain. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few shortcomings with the bat at the moment which we need to address before the next game.\u201d</p> <p>At the Oval <strong>Warwickshire </strong>are just over halfway towards reaching their target of 290, ending the day on 148-3 with Dominic Sibley \u2013 who came through the ranks at <strong>Surrey </strong>before moving to Birmingham in 2017 \u2013 unbeaten on 52</p> <p>In Division Two heavy rain meant that no play was possible at Northampton, while in Bristol action was delayed until after lunch. <strong>Glamorgan</strong>, currently second in the table behind Lancashire, then added precisely 100 runs to their overnight total before being bowled out for 287, giving <strong>Gloucestershire </strong>a first-innings advantage of 26 runs.

Captain Abell drilled straight back at Porter before Pakistan star Ali edged to Tom Westley at third slip. </p> <p>James Hildreth and Tom Banton attempted to counter-attack in the hope of ticking down the runs quicker, with the latter hooking a six off Aaron Beard. </p> <p>The introduction of Harmer, as often happens, brought about the end of a 31-stand with the last delivery of his primary over - as Banton flicked to a stooping Nick Browne at short mid-wicket. </p> <p>Hildreth, who survived a tough drop from Ryan ten Doeschate at short leg on 25, departed on the stroke of lunch when his attempted upper-cut flicked behind to Adam Wheater. </p> <p>After the interval, Somerset collapsed, with Porter and Harmer sharing three wickets in 17 balls. </p> <p>Steven Davies was caught on the crease as he edged the spinner to Alastair Cook at first slip, George Bartlett was well caught by Dan Lawrence at gully before Jamie Overton mimicked his first innings dismissal by picking out Browne on the square-leg boundary. </p> <p>In-form Lewis Gregory provided a punchy antidote to the slide with four maximums off Harmer, including three in a row, all over various degrees of mid-wicket. But having reached 40 from 33 balls, Beard snapped both Gregory\u2019s middle stump and a bail with the second ball of his return to the attack. </p> <p>Beard wrapped up the victory as Tim Groenewald picked out Browne at deep square-leg and splayed Jack Brooks\u2019 stumps. </p> <p>Earlier, Essex\u2019s second innings was wrapped up in 9.5 morning overs as Groenewald claimed his 16th five-wicket haul in First-Class cricket. Fast bowler Groenewald, who was only playing due to Craig Overton\u2019s groin injury, followed up his three wickets the previous evening by collapsing Harmer\u2019s off-stump with his second ball of the morning. </p> <p>He thought he had Peter Siddle latter in the same over, as the Australian edged to Jamie Overton at second slip - but the two umpires convened to agree the ball had not carried, much to the ire of Somerset. </p> <p>They need not have worried as Gregory had him and Adam Wheater caught in the slips soon after before Groenewald wrapped up the innings when Porter nicked to second slip. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T17:29:48.209Z\">at 6.29pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d1233a18f081e872734e87f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T14:47:23.959Z\">3.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>At the Oval Surrey have been bowled out </strong>for 325, setting Warwickshire a target of 290.

      "bodyText": "And that\u2019s all from me. It\u2019s been a blast. I\u2019m off, with one last shout-out for this week\u2019s Spin. Bye! Here\u2019s a round-up of today\u2019s action: Essex resuscitated their title hopes by inflicting a first County Championship defeat of the season on Somerset, whose attempt to chase down a target of 269 started calamitously, with Tom Abell and Azhar Ali dismissed off the second delivery of Jamie Porter\u2019s first and second overs respectively, and never developed any momentum from there. Porter ended with four wickets while Aaron Beard, having taken four in five first-innings overs, added three more from 4.2 overs in the second. In overcast conditions Essex started the day by losing their last four second-innings wickets for 19 runs, before tearing into Somerset. Other than Lewis Gregory, whose 34-ball 40 \u2013 ended by a Beard delivery that snapped a stump and smashed a bail \u2013 included three successive sixes off Simon Harmer, no batsman shone, with James Hildreth and Tom Banton the only others to reach double figures in the leaders\u2019 second knock. \u201cWe were completely outplayed and didn\u2019t deserve anything from the game,\u201d said Tom Abell, the Somerset captain. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few shortcomings with the bat at the moment which we need to address before the next game.\u201d At the Oval Warwickshire are just over halfway towards reaching their target of 290, ending the day on 148-3 with Dominic Sibley \u2013 who came through the ranks at Surrey before moving to Birmingham in 2017 \u2013 unbeaten on 52 In Division Two heavy rain meant that no play was possible at Northampton, while in Bristol action was delayed until after lunch. Glamorgan, currently second in the table behind Lancashire, then added precisely 100 runs to their overnight total before being bowled out for 287, giving Gloucestershire a first-innings advantage of 26 runs. By stumps that had been extended to 67 for the loss of two wickets including Chris Dent, captain and scorer of a first-inning century, for two. At Hove Durham\u2019s Cameron Bancroft and Ned Eckersley extended their fifth-wicket partnership from an overnight 169 to 282 before the latter fell, caught and bowled by Luke Wells; 5.1 overs and 12 runs later they were all out for 384. Sussex\u2019s response started abysmally, with Wells, Will Beer and Harry Finch all dismissed with the score on two, but David Wiese and the unbeaten Delray Rawlins both scored half-centuries as they recovered to reach 226-9 at stumps, still 153 runs behind. And here is confirmation that that is the end of today\u2019s county cricket action. Warwickshire end the day on 148-3, a shade over halfway towards their target of 290. I\u2019ve not been told that play has finished at the Oval, though this tweet certainly suggests that it has: Stumps at Hove, where Sussex are on 231-9, still 153 behind Durham\u2019s first-innings total. Delray Rawlins remains unbeaten on 56*, but they look in a deep hole. Disaster for Sussex at Hove, Wiese is out for 56 and Aaron Thomason follows quickly afterwards for only 3, leaving the home side nine down and still 161 runs behind Durham. Rawlins is still there on 55 and Ollie Robinson, who has a first-class average of 20.93, will hopefully provide support. Bad light has brought an end to the day\u2019s play at Bristol. Gloucestershire finish on 41-2, a lead of 68 over Glamorgan. More patient accumulation from Warwickshire at the Oval, Dom Sibley is closing in on a half-century and Sam Hain has added 25 to an unbroken partnership of 52 for the third wicket. With the weather looking fine tomorrow, Surrey could do with a couple of quick wickets. Delray Rawlins has joined David Wiese in reaching his half-century at Hove and this eighth-wicket stand has now added 108 valuable runs for Sussex as well as securing them their first batting bonus point of the match. Gloucestershire have lost their second wicket at Bristol, Miles Hammond has been bowled by Daniel Douthwaite and joins skipper Chris Dent back in the pavilion. The home side lead by 61 with eight second-innings wickets remaining. Encouraging news regarding Brian Lara: David Wiese has reached his half-century at Hove and has received valuable support from Delray Rawlins (46) in an unbroken eighth-wicket partnership of 92. Sussex still trail by 178 but look well-placed to avoid the follow-on. At the Oval, where the only game worth watching in London is taking place today, Warwickshire are making steady progress having reached 80-2 in pursuit of a victory target of 290. Sussex are in some disarray at Hove, having slumped to 147-7 in reply to Durham\u2019s first-innings 384. David Wiese is still there on 42 and he will be hoping to lead a rally with the tail. Glamorgan are all out for 287 at Bristol. Gloucestershire will start their second innings with a lead of 26, not a huge advantage but better than nothing. Three wickets each for Payne, Higgins and Shaw. With play here at Chelmsford having ended some time ago, I\u2019m going to head homewards. I\u2019ll be back soon(ish), and in the meantime the fine folk of the Guardian sports desk will keep things ticking over. And they\u2019ve also got the kettles on at Bristol, where a close game appears to be breaking out. Tea is being taken at Hove, where Sussex are 96-5 in reply to Durham\u2019s 384. Here\u2019s a report on Essex\u2019s victory over Somerset from the ECB Reporters Network: Essex proved themselves as serious County Championship title contenders as they condemned table-toppers Somerset to their first defeat of the season. Fast bowler Jamie Porter followed up his five for 51 in the first innings by blasting through Somerset\u2019s batting line-up with figures of four for 22 - as the early pacesetters were bowled out for 117 to lose by 151 runs at Chelmsford. Somerset had arrived at Chelmsford with a 30-point advantage at the summit of Division One, as their quest for their maiden Championship title appeared unassailable. But they departed with Essex only 13 points adrift, breathing down their necks and looking ominous at home - with the county recording a quartet of hefty victories against Kent, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire and now Somerset at the County Ground. Somerset were given 269 runs to win, having briskly taken the last four Essex wickets, but were bowled out inside 33 overs. Porter pounced with the second ball of each of his first two overs - as opening pair Tom Abell and Azhar Ali failed to deal with his pace. Captain Abell drilled straight back at Porter before Pakistan star Ali edged to Tom Westley at third slip. James Hildreth and Tom Banton attempted to counter-attack in the hope of ticking down the runs quicker, with the latter hooking a six off Aaron Beard. The introduction of Harmer, as often happens, brought about the end of a 31-stand with the last delivery of his primary over - as Banton flicked to a stooping Nick Browne at short mid-wicket. Hildreth, who survived a tough drop from Ryan ten Doeschate at short leg on 25, departed on the stroke of lunch when his attempted upper-cut flicked behind to Adam Wheater. After the interval, Somerset collapsed, with Porter and Harmer sharing three wickets in 17 balls. Steven Davies was caught on the crease as he edged the spinner to Alastair Cook at first slip, George Bartlett was well caught by Dan Lawrence at gully before Jamie Overton mimicked his first innings dismissal by picking out Browne on the square-leg boundary. In-form Lewis Gregory provided a punchy antidote to the slide with four maximums off Harmer, including three in a row, all over various degrees of mid-wicket. But having reached 40 from 33 balls, Beard snapped both Gregory\u2019s middle stump and a bail with the second ball of his return to the attack. Beard wrapped up the victory as Tim Groenewald picked out Browne at deep square-leg and splayed Jack Brooks\u2019 stumps. Earlier, Essex\u2019s second innings was wrapped up in 9.5 morning overs as Groenewald claimed his 16th five-wicket haul in First-Class cricket. Fast bowler Groenewald, who was only playing due to Craig Overton\u2019s groin injury, followed up his three wickets the previous evening by collapsing Harmer\u2019s off-stump with his second ball of the morning. He thought he had Peter Siddle latter in the same over, as the Australian edged to Jamie Overton at second slip - but the two umpires convened to agree the ball had not carried, much to the ire of Somerset. They need not have worried as Gregory had him and Adam Wheater caught in the slips soon after before Groenewald wrapped up the innings when Porter nicked to second slip. At the Oval Surrey have been bowled out for 325, setting Warwickshire a target of 290. They are 22 without loss after nine overs at tea. The result here leaves Essex second in the table, 13 points behind Somerset after seven games. Here\u2019s their captain, Ryan ten Doeschate: If you look at how Somerset\u2019s season has gone they have managed to manufacture results, those are the sort of things you need to swing a championship your way \u2013 picking up points when things aren\u2019t going your way. Their six wins from seven games is very impressive and for us this was a must win game \u2013 it would have been very hard to catch them if they were 55 points ahead at the halfway stage. We are only at the halfway stage and I think Hampshire also have enough points to be challenging but Somerset will be there or thereabouts. If we play good cricket and stay in our bubble and not look too far ahead then that last game of the season at Somerset will be the showdown for the season. The Somerset captain, Tom Abell, has been talking after his side\u2019s defeat at Essex: We were completely outplayed this week and didn\u2019t deserve anything from the game. We\u2019ve got a few shortcomings with the bat at the moment which we need to address before the next game. It is no means the end of the world and we are still in a great position and have been playing great cricket in the Championship. We weren\u2019t good enough this week and have lost comprehensively because of that but we will be back next week for Hampshire. There will always be periods when you don\u2019t play at your best but in that there have been times when we haven\u2019t been at our best that we have shown that fight and character to wrestle back the momentum in games which we didn\u2019t do this week. Next week is massive for us, we need to get back to winning ways. We need to be on the ball and I am confident we will be. Their game against Hampshire starts in Taunton on Sunday. At Bristol, where play only got under way at 2pm, it\u2019s now raining wickets (well, mizzling). At Hove, where Durham crumbled from 372-5 to 384 all out before lunch, Sussex\u2019s reply started in the worst possible manner, the third wicket falling with just two runs on the board. They have recovered somewhat, but at 50-4, with Stiaan van Zyl their top scorer so far with 21*, it\u2019s a long road back. The most emphatic of endings to this match, as Aaron Beard takes out middle and off stumps, Brooks is the last batsman to fall, and Essex\u2019s victory is confirmed. Beard has bowled fewer than 10 overs in this match, and taken seven wickets. He finishes with astonishing match figures of 9.2-1-45-7. Somerset\u2019s first defeat of the season is but minutes away from being confirmed. Tim Groenewald is their ninth wicket to fall, caught at deep square leg. Here\u2019s a milestone for all the milestone fans out there, coming through from the Oval where Tim Ambrose has taken a catch. Gregory has gone, Aaron Beard not just finding middle stump but breaking it, and a bail as well. I think the ball clipped the inside edge on its way through, but it all happened in a bit of a wildly destructive blur. So in the last couple of overs most of the equipment has had to be changed. Somerset are 110-8. The world has gone crazy at Chelmsford, where Lewis Gregory looks like he wants to win this, and in short order as well. Simon Harmer\u2019s eighth over has started with three successive sixes, the last of which cleared the ground and has forced a delay while an alternative ball is located. Another 29 sixes and Somerset are home and dry. Meanwhile in Bristol, play is about to get under way. Somerset seem really keen to get home. Jamie Overton is the latest to fall, hoiking wildly to deep square leg, a very strange shot in the circumstances. It\u2019s 73-7 now, and they\u2019re 196 notional fairytale runs behind. Some afternoon reading for you, in the shape of this week\u2019s Spin: The situation is looking increasingly bad/impossible for the league leaders, with Somerset now six down to Essex and still 202 runs behind. It\u2019s 67-6, with George Bartlett gone for eight, caught low down at gully. Some scores on the doors. At Chelmsford Steven Davies has just become Somerset\u2019s fifth second-innings wicket to fall, caught by Cook at slip off the bowling of Harmer: First Division Essex 216 &amp; 183 v Somerset 131 &amp; 65-5 Surrey 194 &amp; 247-6 v Warwickshire 230 Second Division Gloucestershire 313 v Glamorgan 187-4 (play is due to start here at 2pm) Northamptonshire 299 v Leicestershire 6-0 (play has been abandoned for the day due to rain) Durham 384 all out v Sussex Hello again! Turns out Anne\u2019s Pantry offers some fine curry action. The umpires have returned to the field here at Chelmsford, where the sun is also currently winning its battle with the clouds, making it rather hot in the press box. Elsewhere: I\u2019m off to discover what delights await at Chelmsford\u2019s finest eaterie, Anne\u2019s Pantry, this lunchtime. Back shortly (fingers crossed)! Another Somerset wicket falls just before lunch! Siddle bowls short and Hildreth leans back, raises his bat, and flicks through some catching practice for Wheater! And that is lunch, with Somerset on 64-3, still 205 runs away from a very distant-looking victory. They have broken for lunch at the Oval, where Surrey lead Warwickshire by 207 with five second-innings wickets in hand. STUMPS at Northamptonshire, where it hasn\u2019t stopped raining and isn\u2019t about to. Somerset settled down after losing both openers for a combined one run in their second innings at Chemsford, with Tom Banton and James Hildreth putting on 39, but the partnership has just been broken, with the 20-year-old Banton falling for 24. After the sun briefly threatened to break through the clouds have very much settled back in, with a very pleasant cooling breeze. As I type Simon Harmer is bowling, with a slip, a leg slip and short leg in place as Essex keep pushing. Ned Eckersley has completed his maiden first-class century for Durham, against Sussex. He and Cameron Bancroft (who has just passed 150) have added 263 for the sixth wicket: it\u2019s 353-5 now. Porter and Beard have been bowling in tandem for Essex, who appear to be deliberately targeting the Shoreditch hipster. And another one! Azhar Ali is caught at slip off Porter for one. It\u2019s 7-2 now, and another 262 needed. There are definitely wickets in the water in Chelmsford today. The Somerset captain, Tom Abell, has fallen to the second ball of the innings, caught and bowled by Porter. On the plus side, James Hildreth has just scored a run. It\u2019s thus 1-1, with 268 still needed. Five-for for Groenewald! Essex\u2019s second innings has been wrapped up for 183, leaving Somerset to get 269 for victory. Groenewald finishes with 5-51 from 14.3 overs, a very fine effort. Last to fall was Jamie Porter, who gave a regulation catch to Overton at slip, and Essex lost four wickets for 19 runs in 9.3 overs this morning. Surrey have lost their first wicket of the day, and now lead Warwickshire by 137 runs with six second-innings wickets remaining. Siddle has gone now, and this time there\u2019s no doubt, as he sends the ball chest-high to Jack Leach. This morning Essex have lost two wickets for three runs. And another one! But no! Peter Siddle edges to second slip, where the catch is taken low and celebrated by Somerset while the batsman looks quizzically at the umpire, uncertain that it carried. From my seat I thought it probably had, but the umpires have a better view and decided that it hadn\u2019t. Groenewald makes clear his displeasure, and one of the umpires is moved to have a word with his captain, Tom Abell. Their quest to do so has just been hampered by the dismissal of Simon Harmer, bowled for a nine-ball duck, from his second ball of the day, by Tim Groenewald. It\u2019s his fourth wicket of the innings, and Essex are thus 166-7. Play has indeed begun on time here, with Lewis Gregory starting the bowling. Essex lead by 249 with consensus being that another 50 would probably leave them in a match-winning position. Welcome, from (occasionally) sunny Chelmsford, where it has rained heavily overnight but the covers are off and we are hopefully all set for a fine day\u2019s play. Here and elsewhere, the current state of play is like this: County Championship Division One Chelmsford: Essex 216 &amp; 164-6 v Somerset 131 (Essex lead by 249 with four wickets remaining) The Oval: Surrey 194 &amp; 141 v Warwickshire 230 (Surrey lead by 105 with seven wickets remaining) County Championship Division Two Bristol: Gloucestershire 313 v Glamorgan 187-4 Northampton: Northamptonshire 299 v Leicestershire 6-0 Brighton: Durham 259-5 v Sussex And onwards, with the smooth tones of yesterday\u2019s Press Association\u2019s County Championship review: Essex seamer Aaron Beard celebrated a new contract by taking four wickets in 13 balls as County Championship Division One leaders Somerset were dismissed for just 131 at Chelmsford. Beard and Jamie Porter - who has likewise signed on until 2021 - shared nine wickets between them as Essex took a first-innings lead of 85 and then reached the close on 164 for six in their second innings. A magic spell from Beard saw Somerset go from 63 for two to 74 for six by the mid-point of the 33rd over, with Somerset captain Tom Abell (36) and George Bartlett (25) the only batsmen to make any sort of impression for the visitors. Ex-England skipper Alastair Cook made 47 before falling to Groeneweld in Essex\u2019s second innings. Surrey sought to make up for a disappointing first day at the Kia Oval as they bowled out Warwickshire for 230, conceding a first-innings lead of 36, before reaching the close on 141 for three. Sam Curran, Jordan Clark and Morne Morkel finished with three wickets each, while Mark Stoneman made 71 off just 85 balls to help the hosts take a lead of 105. In Division Two, Chris Jordan took three wickets in just eight balls for Sussex but Durham ended the day on 259 for five thanks to a brilliant century from Cameron Bancroft and strong support from Ned Eckersley. Jordan ripped through the Durham top order as the visitors went from 64 for one to 90 for five. But captain Bancroft, having decided to open the batting, stood firm and ended the day unbeaten on 120, while Eckersley was on 70 at the other end come stumps. Chris Dent\u2019s 105 provided the backbone of Gloucestershire\u2019s innings at Bristol but once he was dismissed the hosts went froM 210 for two to 313 all out, with Glamorgan reaching 187 for four in reply before stumps. Alex Wakeley hit 65, his second Championship half-century of the season, as Northamptonshire made 299 against Leicestershire, who then closed six without loss.",

      "bodyText": "In the long, lamented history of Israeli-Palestinian peace plans, rarely have expectations been so low. As Jared Kushner took to the stage in Bahrain to effectively lay waste to decades of doctrine on how to solve the conflict, a solution seemed more out of reach than ever. Kushner\u2019s proposal has been put together by hardliners who have tossed out the rulebook and written a formula of their own serving the interests of the Israeli rightwing. The \u201cPeace to Prosperity\u201d conference on Tuesday marked the moment where the new mantra was imposed, demanding that Palestinians put a price on their surrender or risk losing even more ground under the most accommodating US administration that Israel has ever known. While Kushner acknowledged that the prosperity he touted was not possible without a \u201cfair political solution\u201d, a political dimension does not appear to be on the administration\u2019s radar. And given Donald Trump\u2019s record, it remains difficult to see how it could be in the remainder of his term. In less than 18 months, Jerusalem has been declared as Israel\u2019s capital, US humanitarian aid has been slashed, settlement construction supported and diplomatic missions closed in Washington, the West Bank and Gaza. Add to that Trump\u2019s recognition of Israel\u2019s claim to the Golan Heights, captured from Syria 52 years ago, and there appears little hope of serious discussions. The foundations of longstanding peace plans underwritten by the US have been torn down and the model is now unrecognisable. There remains an outside chance that some of these seismic policy shifts could be overturned at a negotiating table. But sitting down at one may be a bridge too far for Palestinians bewildered by the abdication from time-honoured formulas. They would be doing so at the mercy of an administration that unashamedly favours one side. Trump officials have consistently failed to commit to the two-state solution model, the principles of which took Yasser Arafat and Yitzhak Rabin to the White House lawn in 1993, and Arafat and Ehud Barak to Camp David seven years later. Both were seminal moments that drew both sides to the point of a solution. Though they failed, they gave a glimpse of what might have been. Nothing has come close since and the ever more complicated political, legal and moral dimensions of the 71-year-old conflict had made a solution unlikely even before the Trump-imposed worldview. Trump has embraced the notion of being disruptor-in-chief, the leader who shook up an ossified world order, who abandoned the playbook, ignored briefings and made consequential calls on instinct and conviction. Kushner has infused his role as Middle East envoy with the approach of a business baron. \u201cUser pays\u201d has been central to the way he has tried to do business in the region and his considerations have often been devoid of cultural or political realities. A central factor in the slow growth of the Palestinian economy has been the Israeli occupation. His \u201cpathway to prosperity\u201d plan does not appear to recognise this. With a weakened hand and little in the coffers, the Palestinians are facing immense pressure not to reject the deal outright.

Other protesters have carried placards with the message: \u201cAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\u201d</p> \n<p>They have also demanded the resignation of the headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson. The school does not teach \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d, the programme that informs children about LGBT identities, but it does share equality messages and books with pupils. This month the school and council secured <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/11/birmingham-anti-lgbt-protesters-banned-school-injunction\">a new injunction banning protesters</a> from standing at the gates.</p> \n<p>During the debate Godsiff, the local MP, raised concerns about the level of consultation with parents and said those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, challenging allegations of \u201chomophobic hatred\u201d against the campaigners.</p> \n<p>Referring to Anderton Park and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/04/birmingham-school-stops-lgbt-lessons-after-parent-protests\">Parkfield Community s</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/04/birmingham-school-stops-lgbt-lessons-after-parent-protests\">chool</a> Godsiff said that protests had taken place because parents had not been consulted properly by teachers about equality teachings.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cI regret the controversies which have arisen around the two schools in Birmingham. I believe they could have been avoided if the schools had taught the provisions of the Equality Act in different ways and taken the parents\u2019 concerns into account.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAt two schools in Birmingham there has been a major reaction among parents which has become increasingly bitter and polarised. Parents felt the school had no regard for their concerns. At two schools they have got it very wrong.\u201d</p> \n<p>He described the protesters as \u201cmostly young mothers\u201d, adding they have \u201cdone nothing wrong, other than be good mothers who want to express concerns about what their children are telling them\u201d.</p> \n<p>Godsiff, who was previously <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/09/labour-mp-criticised-for-siding-with-birmingham-school-protesters\">reprimanded by Labour\u2019s chief whip</a> after backing the campaigners, concluded his speech with an apology for \u201cany offence caused\u201d by what he has said or written, including to members of the LGBT community in Birmingham and across the country.</p> \n<p>He was heckled throughout his speech by Labour colleagues and others who disputed his claims that the protesters were mainly women and mothers of children.</p> \n<p>Labour MP Stephen Doughty (Cardiff South and Penarth) suggested the protests at the school were due to a small number of individuals \u201cwhipping this up, creating a myth and creating fear\u201d.</p> \n<p>Doughty, who described himself as openly gay, said he had watched scenes in Birmingham with horror. He also revealed that two of the lead protesters from Birmingham had come to his constituency handing out leaflets and trying to give a talk which was subsequently cancelled.</p> \n<p>However, Godsiff maintained that some of those those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, claiming the headteacher seemed \u201ctotally unwilling to have meetings with the parents to address their concerns and to seek a compromise way of resolving the conflict\u201d.</p> \n<p>Education minister Nick Gibb said the government had introduced the regulations for making relationships and sex education (RSE) compulsory in schools and was determined to press ahead with the policy.</p> \n<p>The guidance he added had been \u201cvery carefully crafted and written in order to build the widest possible consensus for this policy\u201d.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cAnd I would say that those people who are opposed to it are at the other end of that consensus and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s unlikely that we will bring those extreme ends of the debate into that consensus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring to the situation in Birmingham he said: \u201cSo we are working very hard to try to assuage concerns if you like, but ultimately we will be on the side of the headteacher in making these decisions because we do believe that ultimately the content of the curriculum is a matter for schools.\u201d</p> \n<p>The protesters are crowdfunding to contest the injunction, raising more than \u00a38,000 of their \u00a330,000 goal to date.

      "bodyText": "Former Labour minister Angela Eagle has insisted: \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get back in the closet,\u201d as she challenged those protesting against LGBT equality teaching during a Commons debate. Eagle, who was the first openly gay female MP when she came out in 1997, said such education is not \u201cpropagandising\u201d or about \u201ctrying to turn people gay\u201d, but about respecting their rights to have an \u201cequal welcome in school\u201d and not be bullied. Her voice broke with emotion when speaking during a debate on parental involvement in teaching linked to the Equality Act 2010, called by Labour MP Roger Godsiff, whose Birmingham Hall Green constituency covers one of the schools targeted by protests against lessons on LGBT relationships. Speaking in the Commons, Eagle said: \u201cWe know that the motivations of some of those involved in this are reactionary and they are to return us to an era where LGBT people should get back in the closet and hide and be ashamed of the way they are. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to get back in the closet or hide or be ashamed of the way we are and nor are we going to allow a generation of pupils that are now in school to go through what the pupils in the 80s had to go through because this chamber let them down and nor are we going to allow this to happen in the name of religion.\u201d Protesters have stood outside Anderton Park primary school every day for 12 weeks with microphones, chanting: \u201cLet kids be kids\u201d and \u201cOur kids, our choice\u201d. Other protesters have carried placards with the message: \u201cAdam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.\u201d They have also demanded the resignation of the headteacher, Sarah Hewitt-Clarkson. The school does not teach \u201cNo Outsiders\u201d, the programme that informs children about LGBT identities, but it does share equality messages and books with pupils. This month the school and council secured a new injunction banning protesters from standing at the gates. During the debate Godsiff, the local MP, raised concerns about the level of consultation with parents and said those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, challenging allegations of \u201chomophobic hatred\u201d against the campaigners. Referring to Anderton Park and Parkfield Community school Godsiff said that protests had taken place because parents had not been consulted properly by teachers about equality teachings. He added: \u201cI regret the controversies which have arisen around the two schools in Birmingham. I believe they could have been avoided if the schools had taught the provisions of the Equality Act in different ways and taken the parents\u2019 concerns into account.\u201d \u201cAt two schools in Birmingham there has been a major reaction among parents which has become increasingly bitter and polarised. Parents felt the school had no regard for their concerns. At two schools they have got it very wrong.\u201d He described the protesters as \u201cmostly young mothers\u201d, adding they have \u201cdone nothing wrong, other than be good mothers who want to express concerns about what their children are telling them\u201d. Godsiff, who was previously reprimanded by Labour\u2019s chief whip after backing the campaigners, concluded his speech with an apology for \u201cany offence caused\u201d by what he has said or written, including to members of the LGBT community in Birmingham and across the country. He was heckled throughout his speech by Labour colleagues and others who disputed his claims that the protesters were mainly women and mothers of children. Labour MP Stephen Doughty (Cardiff South and Penarth) suggested the protests at the school were due to a small number of individuals \u201cwhipping this up, creating a myth and creating fear\u201d. Doughty, who described himself as openly gay, said he had watched scenes in Birmingham with horror. He also revealed that two of the lead protesters from Birmingham had come to his constituency handing out leaflets and trying to give a talk which was subsequently cancelled. However, Godsiff maintained that some of those those who protested \u201chad some valid reasons for doing so\u201d, claiming the headteacher seemed \u201ctotally unwilling to have meetings with the parents to address their concerns and to seek a compromise way of resolving the conflict\u201d. Education minister Nick Gibb said the government had introduced the regulations for making relationships and sex education (RSE) compulsory in schools and was determined to press ahead with the policy. The guidance he added had been \u201cvery carefully crafted and written in order to build the widest possible consensus for this policy\u201d. He said: \u201cAnd I would say that those people who are opposed to it are at the other end of that consensus and I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s unlikely that we will bring those extreme ends of the debate into that consensus.\u201d Referring to the situation in Birmingham he said: \u201cSo we are working very hard to try to assuage concerns if you like, but ultimately we will be on the side of the headteacher in making these decisions because we do believe that ultimately the content of the curriculum is a matter for schools.\u201d The protesters are crowdfunding to contest the injunction, raising more than \u00a38,000 of their \u00a330,000 goal to date. A full hearing to consider the injunction is to take place between 22 and 31 July. Godsiff\u2019s move came as the Department for Education (DfE) published its updated statutory guidance on relationships, sex and health education, which will involve all primary and secondary school pupils in England receiving lessons on relationships, including LGBT, from September 2020. The guidance gives discretion to primary school heads over whether teaching pupils about LGBT relationships is age-appropriate, despite fears from the National Association of Head Teachers that the DfE\u2019s policy leaves schools vulnerable to protests such as those in Birmingham and Manchester. Damian Hinds, the education secretary, said the new guidance \u201cis clear that children should leave school having learned about LGBT relationships\u201d. \u201cI would strongly encourage schools to discuss with children in class that there are all sorts of different, strong and loving families, including families with same-sex parents, while they are at primary school,\u201d Hinds said. Ruth Hunt, the chief executive of Stonewall, supported the new policy, saying: \u201cThis guidance is a historic achievement that will change the way LGBT families, people and relationships are taught.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Britain\u2019s doctors have urged ministers to scrap controversial rules that force migrants to pay upfront before they can receive NHS care for serious illnesses such as cancer. The British Medical Association has become the first body representing medical staff to call for the complete abolition of the charges, which have been heavily criticised by MPs and health charities. Delegates gathering in Belfast for the annual conference of the union, which represents 155,000 doctors, overwhelmingly backed a motion which called for \u201cthe policy of charging migrants for NHS care to be abandoned and for the NHS to be free for all at the point of delivery\u201d. Medical bodies such as the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have previously only demanded that the regulations be suspended pending an inquiry into how they were working. The BMA\u2019s demand follows mounting criticism of the rules for stopping undocumented migrants from accessing care they need because they cannot pay the fees in advance. In cases highlighted by the Guardian, some of those denied care died. The National Health Service (charges to overseas visitors) (amendment) regulations 2017 compels hospitals in England to check overseas visitors\u2019 eligibility for free NHS care and seek payment upfront from those deemed ineligible, such as asylum seekers and visa overstayers.

      "body": "<p>Nobody fears the Financial Conduct Authority. Nobody fears its genial boss, Andrew Bailey. Not really. Or at least not enough to worry about doing jail time or even being banned from working in the City if they do something wrong.</p> <p>The FCA might be the main regulator of the financial services industry on behalf of Britain\u2019s vast army of consumers. It might have a wide range of powers to bring financial services companies to heal when they rip off individuals. Yet it appears to be a creature of the establishment, overly keen to join the Treasury and the Bank of England in protecting the industry when questions arise about the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/18/vince-cable-disgusted-with-fca-over-rbs-mistreatment-of-small-firms\">bad behaviour of companies</a> flogging financial products.</p> <p>Bailey is ex-Bank of England and the relatively new FCA chair, Charles Randell, spent the bulk of his career in the City as a lawyer, latterly helping piece together the battered banks he now regulates.</p> <p>So it\u2019s no wonder Bailey used his time before MPs on the Treasury select committee to explain why it was that his organisation <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2018/feb/20/who-presided-over-rbs-scandal\">couldn\u2019t do much</a> about one claim of wrongdoing after another.</p> <p>A case in point was the well-documented efforts of staff at Royal Bank of Scotland to suck dry many of the small businesses caught up in its Global Restructuring Group. Their activities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/13/fca-report-into-rbs-branded-complete-whitewash\">lay outside the FCA\u2019s remit</a>. It didn\u2019t regulate small business customers. And anyway, there wasn\u2019t any evidence of outright fraud, even though many victims argued there was enough systemic wrongdoing to sanction the bank\u2019s top brass, which included Nathan Bostock, who oversaw GRG and now runs Santander UK.</p> <p>The Labour MP Rushanara Ali asked if Bailey was too nice to bankers. He disagreed and then interestingly Randell leapt to his defence, warning the committee the FCA was coming under even greater strain.</p> <p>With 60,000 firms, 3,200 funds and 150,000 approved persons to regulate, the job is immense, he said.</p> <p>Bailey added that the dramatic changes of the way we all save, especially for retirement, played a part. No longer are we looked after by our employers and the insurance industry, which in a previous era took on the risks of falling investment returns and increasing life expectancy.</p> <p>In the switch to self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) and other forms of direct investment, which place the onus on savers to understand the market and the risks they are taking, scandals are likely to proliferate.</p> <p>He probably had in mind the case of the fund manager Neil Woodford, who manages more than $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in an Equity Income fund that is now frozen due to the sheer weight of investors seeking to move their money elsewhere.</p> <p>MPs had already expressed concern at the way institutional investors quit the fund, leaving the smaller investors trapped.</p> <p>Bailey looked forlorn when he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/25/neil-woodford-fund-sailing-close-to-wind-watchdog-says\">Woodford had broken the spirit and not the letter </a>of the FCA\u2019s rules in the way he moved shares around to avoid a regulatory clampdown. If only the regulator could police the City\u2019s ethics armed with a set of principles rather than a code. Then he might catch out wrongdoers.</p> <p>Bailey, though, doesn\u2019t display any urgency or passion for punishing wrongdoers. Woodford and the financial advice industry have extracted tens of millions of pounds in fees while knowing the fund was suffering. If Bailey is disgusted by the way the industry behaves, he should say so, and say so loudly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Big pharma, big pay packet</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d09d5073402532febd5e2e20ed561741a00c2d20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d09d5073402532febd5e2e20ed561741a00c2d20/0_335_3643_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman has a botox injection\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Botox maker Allergan is now owned by AbbVie.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jacquelyn Martin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Big is beautiful in the US healthcare industry and it\u2019s not just about bigger budgets to find new drugs.

      "bodyText": "Nobody fears the Financial Conduct Authority. Nobody fears its genial boss, Andrew Bailey. Not really. Or at least not enough to worry about doing jail time or even being banned from working in the City if they do something wrong. The FCA might be the main regulator of the financial services industry on behalf of Britain\u2019s vast army of consumers. It might have a wide range of powers to bring financial services companies to heal when they rip off individuals. Yet it appears to be a creature of the establishment, overly keen to join the Treasury and the Bank of England in protecting the industry when questions arise about the bad behaviour of companies flogging financial products. Bailey is ex-Bank of England and the relatively new FCA chair, Charles Randell, spent the bulk of his career in the City as a lawyer, latterly helping piece together the battered banks he now regulates. So it\u2019s no wonder Bailey used his time before MPs on the Treasury select committee to explain why it was that his organisation couldn\u2019t do much about one claim of wrongdoing after another. A case in point was the well-documented efforts of staff at Royal Bank of Scotland to suck dry many of the small businesses caught up in its Global Restructuring Group. Their activities lay outside the FCA\u2019s remit. It didn\u2019t regulate small business customers. And anyway, there wasn\u2019t any evidence of outright fraud, even though many victims argued there was enough systemic wrongdoing to sanction the bank\u2019s top brass, which included Nathan Bostock, who oversaw GRG and now runs Santander UK. The Labour MP Rushanara Ali asked if Bailey was too nice to bankers. He disagreed and then interestingly Randell leapt to his defence, warning the committee the FCA was coming under even greater strain. With 60,000 firms, 3,200 funds and 150,000 approved persons to regulate, the job is immense, he said. Bailey added that the dramatic changes of the way we all save, especially for retirement, played a part. No longer are we looked after by our employers and the insurance industry, which in a previous era took on the risks of falling investment returns and increasing life expectancy. In the switch to self-invested personal pensions (Sipps) and other forms of direct investment, which place the onus on savers to understand the market and the risks they are taking, scandals are likely to proliferate. He probably had in mind the case of the fund manager Neil Woodford, who manages more than $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) in an Equity Income fund that is now frozen due to the sheer weight of investors seeking to move their money elsewhere. MPs had already expressed concern at the way institutional investors quit the fund, leaving the smaller investors trapped. Bailey looked forlorn when he said Woodford had broken the spirit and not the letter of the FCA\u2019s rules in the way he moved shares around to avoid a regulatory clampdown. If only the regulator could police the City\u2019s ethics armed with a set of principles rather than a code. Then he might catch out wrongdoers. Bailey, though, doesn\u2019t display any urgency or passion for punishing wrongdoers. Woodford and the financial advice industry have extracted tens of millions of pounds in fees while knowing the fund was suffering. If Bailey is disgusted by the way the industry behaves, he should say so, and say so loudly. Big pharma, big pay packet Big is beautiful in the US healthcare industry and it\u2019s not just about bigger budgets to find new drugs. It also makes for monster pay packets. The latest takeover involves Chicago-based AbbVie, which is led by Richard Gonzalez. The chairman and chief executive, who earns a bonus directly from sales of the firm\u2019s bestselling drug, will run the new business once AbbVie has swallowed Allergan, the Irish-based maker of Botox. At the moment Gonzalez makes $20.8m (\u00a316.3m) a year. That figure is likely to rise after the $63bn deal goes through. Not least because Brenton Saunders, the boss of Allergan, will also join the new board, bringing his $32.8m a year remuneration package with him. Earlier this year Giovanni Caforio struck a deal as the boss of Bristol-Myers Squibb, the US drugmaker, to buy rival Celgene for $90bn. Ahead of the deal Caforio was paid $19.4m a year. And the list goes on. Gonzalez was grilled in Congress recently about his bonus scheme and whether it provided an incentive to keep drug prices high. The answer was obvious and only goes to support the claim that health businesses in the US are run as cash machines for executives.",

The Guardian understands that there was an in-house debate at the Mail about whether they could be taken by the newspaper\u2019s print edition.</p> <p>The round of broadcast interviews \u2013 including one in which Johnson sparked ridicule and suspicion about the veracity of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax?CMP=share_btn_tw\">his claim to relax</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-reveals-he-makes-models-of-buses-to-relax?CMP=share_btn_tw\"> by making models of buses</a> with wooden crates \u2013 has been watched with incredulity by political communications experts.</p> <p>Lord Wood of Anfield, the Labour peer and political strategist, said that Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-bbc-interview-reveals-few-details-brexit-plan-row-partner\">interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg</a> broadcast on Monday night made him immediately question his \u201cmatch fitness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe seems convinced that his path to No 10 is assured if he says nothing of interest and lets the party machine and arithmetic do its work,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cBut saying nothing for reasons of discipline has tipped over into looking like he has nothing to say. This is a massive problem for a frontrunner.\u201d</p> <p>Wood suggests that a campaign full of \u201cbons mots and memorable phrases\u201d would have been much more effective at keeping unwelcome scrutiny away from Johnson\u2019s door. Instead, a seeming reluctance to stand up and fight might be providing uncomfortable reminders of May to the Tory faithful.</p> <p>At the end of the day, though, it is that fractionally small cohort of the population who ultimately matter. If this is an audience of voters who have been primed for some time to distrust mainstream media narratives and view the Guardian and BBC as hostile leftwing entities then, for all his campaign\u2019s missteps, the negative publicity surrounding Johnson might yet reinforce narratives of persecution by a liberal elite.</p> <p><em>\u2022 Additional reporting by Jim Waterson</em></p>",

Famously a proponent of \u201cscraping the barnacles off the boat\u201d \u2013 his phrase referring to a relentless focus on core messages \u2013 Crosby couldn\u2019t help May when she ran into trouble, or negotiate the chill winds now being experienced by Johnson. Then there has been the continuing, and to some surprising, tough ride given to Johnson by sections of a normally supportive Tory Press, which includes the Telegraph, the title from which he has earned a \u00a3275,000 salary as a columnist. On Tuesday, the paper splashed with the headline \u201cBoris tries to keep the show on the road\u201d as it and other titles all ran front-page pictures of the photograph of him and his partner Carrie Symonds released by Johnson\u2019s campaign team as part of a PR strategy. Perhaps more significantly, the Daily Mail carried a front-page display for a Jan Moir column titled: \u201cBoris and the Mills &amp; Boon scene that takes us all for fools.\u201d Rather than put unanswered questions about the altercation to bed, new ones have arisen about the circumstances of the release of the image, which came without bylines or dates. If the intention was to ensure that they were widely disseminated, then the choice of releasing them in the first instance to the Mail Online seems a peculiar one. The Guardian understands that there was an in-house debate at the Mail about whether they could be taken by the newspaper\u2019s print edition. The round of broadcast interviews \u2013 including one in which Johnson sparked ridicule and suspicion about the veracity of his claim to relax by making models of buses with wooden crates \u2013 has been watched with incredulity by political communications experts. Lord Wood of Anfield, the Labour peer and political strategist, said that Johnson\u2019s interview with the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg broadcast on Monday night made him immediately question his \u201cmatch fitness\u201d. \u201cHe seems convinced that his path to No 10 is assured if he says nothing of interest and lets the party machine and arithmetic do its work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut saying nothing for reasons of discipline has tipped over into looking like he has nothing to say. This is a massive problem for a frontrunner.\u201d Wood suggests that a campaign full of \u201cbons mots and memorable phrases\u201d would have been much more effective at keeping unwelcome scrutiny away from Johnson\u2019s door. Instead, a seeming reluctance to stand up and fight might be providing uncomfortable reminders of May to the Tory faithful. At the end of the day, though, it is that fractionally small cohort of the population who ultimately matter. If this is an audience of voters who have been primed for some time to distrust mainstream media narratives and view the Guardian and BBC as hostile leftwing entities then, for all his campaign\u2019s missteps, the negative publicity surrounding Johnson might yet reinforce narratives of persecution by a liberal elite. \u2022 Additional reporting by Jim Waterson",

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index. But, equally, you must have the humility to accept that you will get things wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rupertneate\"><b>Rupert Neate</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Bailey denied warning signs had been missed, saying Woodford had followed the EU rules which do not require the FCA to be updated.</p> \n<p>Among the problems facing Woodford was the proportion of the unlisted investments in his portfolio.

Near the Tory party association headquarters on Upper Richmond Road, on the heels of Johnson\u2019s cadre who had already departed, a painter and decorator who, like all other interviewees, did not want to be named, said: \u201cHe just said hello to us and waved back for about 15 minutes \u2026 I think he\u2019s a good chap, he\u2019s what the world needs, really.\u201d Another bystander, a thirtysomething Tory voter pushing a pram, was less impressed. \u201cI don\u2019t think he has been particularly truthful about his current romantic situation, and if someone does not tell the truth about their personal life then how can they be trusted in office?\u201d Johnson has been increasingly associated with gardens, from the scene of his now infamous photo with Symonds to his doomed Garden Bridge project, so the RHS garden in Surrey was an apt location for the next pitstop. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe he was wasting his time round here,\u201d said a woman who had been having lunch. \u201cHe wanders in with an entourage, security, cars and cameras, instead of being where he should be \u2026 at the debate [against Jeremy Hunt] on Sky which he\u2019s cancelled to come to Wisley.\u201d Her friend, a Tory member who said she would be voting for Johnson, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s the man he used to be. He\u2019s not conducting himself in the right way if he really wants to be PM, which is a shame because I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone else.\u201d Stopping to collect her thoughts, she added: \u201cHe has changed, I do wonder if he\u2019s going off the idea a bit.\u201d Despite it being in a constituency with a Tory majority of 17,000, most people to whom the Guardian spoke at Wisley were unaware that Johnson had come and gone. \u201cI\u2019m not a Boris fan but it\u2019s an easy audience here, he\u2019s a clever man \u2013 despite acting like he isn\u2019t, quite often,\u201d a woman said. \u201cIt\u2019s all manufactured.\u201d Waiting to be told the location of the next stop, the trusted photographers following Johnson\u2019s entourage admitted they found the tour sycophantic. \u201cHis first question and only question was: \u2018Are you Tory members?\u2019\u201d one said, describing the team around Boris as \u201cfurtive\u201d. After receiving a tip about the next location, they left and apologised for not being able to take anyone with them. \u201cSorry, it\u2019s all about trust.\u201d That location transpired to be Oxshott, an affluent village five miles away. Johnson bought \u00a34.50 worth of fennel and tarragon sausages from the butchers, had a sip of tea in a cafe and drank a glass of water in a pub. Those present said he refused to discuss the provenance of the Symonds photo and rejected suggestions he had avoided scrutiny. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to hear about it,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s beyond satire.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The modern conservatives often seem afraid of new technology. They act as though renewable energy, battery storage and electric cars will take us down the path to blackouts, economic ruin and, of course, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/07/shorten-wants-to-end-the-weekend-morrison-attacks-labors-electric-vehicle-policy\">end of weekends as we know them</a>. But if recent history has taught us anything it\u2019s that there is nothing consistent about the modern conservatives, most of whom live in fear of the unintended consequences of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/commentisfree/2019/jun/21/climate-crisis-what-you-can-do-while-government-does-nothing\">renewable power</a> but warmly welcome the unexpected possibilities of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/the-reason-australia-doesnt-have-nuclear-power-the-workers-fought-back\">nuclear power</a>.</p> <p>The same contradictions are obvious in agriculture. While spruiking the virtues of genetic modification (GM) and the safety of glyphosate is standard fare for the modern conservatives, not all agricultural innovations are so warmly welcomed. While organic crops offer farmers significantly higher returns, such farming practices are often dismissed as \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d rather than real farming. And when chickenless chicken meat was launched on to the market recently (apparently it tastes a bit like chicken), the National\u2019s deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/senbmckenzie/status/1141963953771180033\">responded by tweeting</a>: \u201cNot happy with latest fake food push. Chicken-free chicken is not chicken, it\u2019s reconstituted peas. We need to protect our farmers.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/22/australias-energy-future-the-real-power-is-not-where-youd-think\">Australia's energy future: the real power is not where you\u2019d think | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not clear whether McKenzie realises that, <a href=\"http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/TP\">on the most recent UN data</a>, Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of chickpeas, or if she simply doesn\u2019t care.</p> <p>While the modern conservatives\u2019 love of all things coal seems to revolve around support for traditional coalmining jobs and fears around renewable energy\u2019s reliability, if you scratch the surface another rich vein of hypocrisy can be found.</p> <p>Despite the many column inches they dedicate to the obvious statement that \u201cthe wind doesn\u2019t always blow, and the sun doesn\u2019t always shine\u201d, modern conservatives remain strategically silent about the fact that so-called baseload coal-fired power stations are <a href=\"http://www.tai.org.au/content/gas-coal-power-plants-135-breakdowns-2018\">notoriously unreliable</a>, especially on the hottest days when we need power most.</p> <p>Similarly, while their technophobia is on full display when talking about the dangers of batteries for renewable energy storage or driverless electric cars, perplexingly, the modern conservative seems relaxed and comfortable when it comes to the fact that robot trucks and robot trains are <a href=\"http://www.tai.org.au/content/adani-s-automated-mine-risks-just-transition-coal-workers\">proliferating in the mining industry</a>. If conservatives were really concerned about creating jobs in regional Australia, they would insist that none of the new coalmines they are so keen to subsidise use any robot trucks or trains. But they aren\u2019t, so they won\u2019t.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not just technological change that the modern conservatives seem confused about; the desirability of cultural change really twists them in a knot too. Take \u201ctraditional family values\u201d for example. On the one hand, modern conservatives rage against the \u201cselfishness\u201d of some parents for denying their children access to a traditional mother and father. But at the same time they\u2019ve created an industrial relations system in which parents \u2013 traditional or otherwise \u2013 struggle to spend time with their kids because they need to work split shifts, weekends and other unsociable hours. Parents working in the gig economy don\u2019t get paid holiday leave to spend time with their children. Indeed, our Pentecostal prime minister doesn\u2019t even think work on Sundays should be discouraged with penalty rates. While parliament never sits on a Sunday, it seems our religious representatives still expect a cheap coffee on the Sabbath.</p> <p>And then there is freedom. Modern conservatives in Australia are up in arms about Israel Folau\u2019s freedom to say whatever it is he wants to say about homosexuals. Eric Abetz \u2013 perhaps the loudest conservative in the Liberal party since the voters of Warringah showed Tony Abbot the door \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.examiner.com.au/story/6194199/abetz-calls-for-folau-sacking-probe-says-true-liberals-value-freedom-of-religion/\">declared:</a> \u201cThe fundamental point of the need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of religion is in the DNA of every true Liberal and that is why I am seeking to pursue it.\u201d</p> <p>But Senator Abetz has not always felt the need to defend this \u201cfundamental\u201d principle of free speech. Back in 2014 when he was \u201cpublic service minister Eric Abetz\u201d, a public servant working at the Australian Taxation Office <a href=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6146470/public-service-minister-eric-abetz-welcomes-resignation-after-controversial-tweet/digital-subscription/\">resigned after being disciplined for making derogatory comments</a> about conservative commentator Melinda Tankard Reist. Commenting on the case, Abetz said this employee\u2019s departure should act as a lesson for the nation\u2019s 165,000 federal public servants and their use of Twitter and other social media. <a href=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6146470/public-service-minister-eric-abetz-welcomes-resignation-after-controversial-tweet/digital-subscription/\">He then went on to state:</a> \u201cAPS employees need to ensure that they understand the APS values and code of conduct and how they apply to the official and unofficial communications.\u201d</p> <p>Abetz\u2019s inconsistent indifference to the obligations of employees to follow their employer\u2019s codes of conduct makes clear that the fundamental principle motivating him has more to do with protecting fellow Christians than support for freedom of expression.</p> <p>Of course, it\u2019s not just conservatives who get caught up in the contradictions of modern politics. There are plenty of environmentalists who rely heavily on the CSIRO\u2019s climate science but publicly question the reliability of its GM science. Likewise, there will be more than a few people cheering on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/24/israel-folau-donations-page-taken-down-by-gofundme-for-breaching-terms-of-service\">GoFundMe\u2019s decision to end Folau\u2019s campaign</a> who were outraged at the thought that a baker might refuse to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple.</p> <p>So, what\u2019s going on? Do modern conservatives like new technology or fear it? Do they like freedom of speech or don\u2019t they? And if both conservatives and progressives are capable of inconsistency when it comes to their principles, is there any point (or hope) in having rational debate anymore? I think there is.</p> <p>While the word \u201cideology\u201d gets thrown around more than it used to, the fact is, ideology is less important than it has ever been. These days, so-called free market ideologues in the Liberal party love to subsidise coalmines while tying unions and charities up in the red tape that they claim to hate. So-called socialists in the Greens want to use market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The problem isn\u2019t the policy positions of the \u201cfree-marketeers\u201d or the \u201csocialists\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the increasingly meaningless labels that are being used.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/29/whats-left-and-right-in-australian-politics-today-the-lines-are-shifting\">What's 'left' and 'right' in Australian politics today? The lines are shifting | Richard Denniss</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Modern conservatives don\u2019t fear technology, they oppose new technologies that harm their friends. Put simply: renewable energy is a threat to the mining industry, but robot trucks and trains will boost the profits of the mining industry.</p> <p>Modern conservatives don\u2019t fear social change. They oppose social change that undermines the power of institutions that they like, such as the church, and they embrace social change like the gig economy because it undermines the power of institutions they fear, like the unions.</p> <p>It\u2019s no longer ideologies that defines and divides Australian politics, but interests. While the philosophical positions adopted by political parties might be all over the shop, the interests they support remain remarkably stable. The right tend to line up behind wealth, power and the establishment, and the left fire up to support new industries that solve new problems, and to protect marginalised groups from established institutions.

      "bodyText": "The modern conservatives often seem afraid of new technology. They act as though renewable energy, battery storage and electric cars will take us down the path to blackouts, economic ruin and, of course, the end of weekends as we know them. But if recent history has taught us anything it\u2019s that there is nothing consistent about the modern conservatives, most of whom live in fear of the unintended consequences of renewable power but warmly welcome the unexpected possibilities of nuclear power. The same contradictions are obvious in agriculture. While spruiking the virtues of genetic modification (GM) and the safety of glyphosate is standard fare for the modern conservatives, not all agricultural innovations are so warmly welcomed. While organic crops offer farmers significantly higher returns, such farming practices are often dismissed as \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d rather than real farming. And when chickenless chicken meat was launched on to the market recently (apparently it tastes a bit like chicken), the National\u2019s deputy leader, Bridget McKenzie, responded by tweeting: \u201cNot happy with latest fake food push. Chicken-free chicken is not chicken, it\u2019s reconstituted peas. We need to protect our farmers.\u201d It is not clear whether McKenzie realises that, on the most recent UN data, Australia is the world\u2019s largest exporter of chickpeas, or if she simply doesn\u2019t care. While the modern conservatives\u2019 love of all things coal seems to revolve around support for traditional coalmining jobs and fears around renewable energy\u2019s reliability, if you scratch the surface another rich vein of hypocrisy can be found. Despite the many column inches they dedicate to the obvious statement that \u201cthe wind doesn\u2019t always blow, and the sun doesn\u2019t always shine\u201d, modern conservatives remain strategically silent about the fact that so-called baseload coal-fired power stations are notoriously unreliable, especially on the hottest days when we need power most. Similarly, while their technophobia is on full display when talking about the dangers of batteries for renewable energy storage or driverless electric cars, perplexingly, the modern conservative seems relaxed and comfortable when it comes to the fact that robot trucks and robot trains are proliferating in the mining industry. If conservatives were really concerned about creating jobs in regional Australia, they would insist that none of the new coalmines they are so keen to subsidise use any robot trucks or trains. But they aren\u2019t, so they won\u2019t. Of course, it\u2019s not just technological change that the modern conservatives seem confused about; the desirability of cultural change really twists them in a knot too. Take \u201ctraditional family values\u201d for example. On the one hand, modern conservatives rage against the \u201cselfishness\u201d of some parents for denying their children access to a traditional mother and father. But at the same time they\u2019ve created an industrial relations system in which parents \u2013 traditional or otherwise \u2013 struggle to spend time with their kids because they need to work split shifts, weekends and other unsociable hours. Parents working in the gig economy don\u2019t get paid holiday leave to spend time with their children. Indeed, our Pentecostal prime minister doesn\u2019t even think work on Sundays should be discouraged with penalty rates. While parliament never sits on a Sunday, it seems our religious representatives still expect a cheap coffee on the Sabbath. And then there is freedom. Modern conservatives in Australia are up in arms about Israel Folau\u2019s freedom to say whatever it is he wants to say about homosexuals. Eric Abetz \u2013 perhaps the loudest conservative in the Liberal party since the voters of Warringah showed Tony Abbot the door \u2013 declared: \u201cThe fundamental point of the need to protect freedom of speech and freedom of religion is in the DNA of every true Liberal and that is why I am seeking to pursue it.\u201d But Senator Abetz has not always felt the need to defend this \u201cfundamental\u201d principle of free speech. Back in 2014 when he was \u201cpublic service minister Eric Abetz\u201d, a public servant working at the Australian Taxation Office resigned after being disciplined for making derogatory comments about conservative commentator Melinda Tankard Reist. Commenting on the case, Abetz said this employee\u2019s departure should act as a lesson for the nation\u2019s 165,000 federal public servants and their use of Twitter and other social media. He then went on to state: \u201cAPS employees need to ensure that they understand the APS values and code of conduct and how they apply to the official and unofficial communications.\u201d Abetz\u2019s inconsistent indifference to the obligations of employees to follow their employer\u2019s codes of conduct makes clear that the fundamental principle motivating him has more to do with protecting fellow Christians than support for freedom of expression. Of course, it\u2019s not just conservatives who get caught up in the contradictions of modern politics. There are plenty of environmentalists who rely heavily on the CSIRO\u2019s climate science but publicly question the reliability of its GM science. Likewise, there will be more than a few people cheering on GoFundMe\u2019s decision to end Folau\u2019s campaign who were outraged at the thought that a baker might refuse to sell a wedding cake to a gay couple. So, what\u2019s going on? Do modern conservatives like new technology or fear it? Do they like freedom of speech or don\u2019t they? And if both conservatives and progressives are capable of inconsistency when it comes to their principles, is there any point (or hope) in having rational debate anymore? I think there is. While the word \u201cideology\u201d gets thrown around more than it used to, the fact is, ideology is less important than it has ever been. These days, so-called free market ideologues in the Liberal party love to subsidise coalmines while tying unions and charities up in the red tape that they claim to hate. So-called socialists in the Greens want to use market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The problem isn\u2019t the policy positions of the \u201cfree-marketeers\u201d or the \u201csocialists\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s the increasingly meaningless labels that are being used. Modern conservatives don\u2019t fear technology, they oppose new technologies that harm their friends. Put simply: renewable energy is a threat to the mining industry, but robot trucks and trains will boost the profits of the mining industry. Modern conservatives don\u2019t fear social change. They oppose social change that undermines the power of institutions that they like, such as the church, and they embrace social change like the gig economy because it undermines the power of institutions they fear, like the unions. It\u2019s no longer ideologies that defines and divides Australian politics, but interests. While the philosophical positions adopted by political parties might be all over the shop, the interests they support remain remarkably stable. The right tend to line up behind wealth, power and the establishment, and the left fire up to support new industries that solve new problems, and to protect marginalised groups from established institutions. There\u2019s nothing wrong with such demarcations, but they have less and less to do with ideology. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

      "bodyText": "The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has warned that the \u201cstrained\u201d relationship between the US and China risks \u201ccollateral\u201d damage in the region, amid growing uncertainty in the global economy. In a major speech ahead of the G20 summit in Osaka this weekend where the US president, Donald Trump, will meet with China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, Morrison has called on China to match its extraordinary economic power with \u201cadditional responsibilities\u201d, saying it has been a key beneficiary from the rules-based international trading system. \u201cUndoubtedly, the most significant change in most recent times has been the shift in the relationship between the United States and China, who exert the greatest influence on our region,\u201d Morrison will say on Wednesday. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe world\u2019s most important bilateral relationship \u2013 the US-China relationship \u2013 is strained: trade tensions have escalated, the collateral damage is spreading, the global trading system is under real pressure.\u201d \u201cThe impact of any further deterioration of the relationship will not be limited to these two major powers.\u201d Saying that the \u201cshifted\u201d balance between the two superpowers required \u201curgent repair\u201d of the rules-based system, Morrison said China\u2019s prosperity had been achieved by having access to global trade, with the benefits not to be \u201cunderestimated\u201d. But since it had achieved its status as a global superpower, with China\u2019s international trade now worth $4tn, China had reached an \u201ceconomic maturity\u201d that required a change to how it dealt with its more developed trading partners. \u201cAs a rising global power, China also now has additional responsibilities. \u201cIt is therefore important that US-China trade tensions are resolved in the broader context of their special power responsibilities, in a way that is WTO-consistent and does not undermine the interests of other parties, including Australia.\u201d The prime minister will also say that there is no longer a level playing field between China and its trading partners, including the US. \u201cIt is now evident that the US believes that the rule-based trading system \u2013 in its current form \u2013 is not capable of dealing with China\u2019s economic structure and policy practices,\u201d Morrison says. \u201cMany of these concerns are legitimate \u2013 forced technology transfer is unfair, intellectual property theft cannot be justified, industrial subsidies are promoting overproduction.\u201d \u201cWhile we acknowledge that large parts of China are still to realise the prosperity of its major economic centres, it is also true that its most economically successful provinces, each of which is larger than most developed nations, including Australia, has reached and sometimes exceeded the economic sophistication of its global competitors. \u201cYet, at the same time, these economies get to compete with concessions, whether they be on trade, environmental obligations or other terms, not available to other developed economies. \u201cOur current trading system seems incapable of acknowledging, let alone resolving, these issues. \u201cThe rules-based system is in need of urgent repair if it is to adequately respond to these new challenges, including the rise of large emerging economies, changing patterns of trade and new technologies.\u201d Trade minister Simon Birmingham reinforced Morrison\u2019s message on Wednesday morning, telling the ABC the US and China both carried \u201cgreat power\u201d, which came with \u201cgreat responsibility\u201d. \u201cPlease end this dispute, to please recognise that the rules-based system for international trade has served us all incredibly well for decades, to commit to it, to modernise it and to work with us to make sure that we can all continue to use that as a platform for prosperity and growth in the future,\u201d he said.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the lure of the unknowable that drew the Australian stage director Matthew Lutton and the Scottish writer David Greig into the inscrutable alien world of Solaris. The thin, cultish 1961 novel by the Polish author Stanislaw Lem reached beyond its sci-fi audience when it was adapted for the screen \u2013 first as a Soviet television play in 1968, and most recently in 2002 by Steven Soderbergh. But it\u2019s an epic, 1972 film adaptation by the Russian auteur Andrei Tarkovsky that made Solaris notorious.

What repels as much as attracts is its somewhat impregnable story: of a sentient planet that works simultaneous miracles and horror on the minds of a crew of displaced, shipbound cosmonauts. As their space station orbits the alien world, the crew members must contend with the sudden presence of facsimiles of people the planet recreates from their memories.

Hugo Weaving appears as well, in video footage. The gender flip of the lead allows the action onstage to become more than just a rehash of the films, and to avoid the re-enactment of creaking sci-fi tropes that often reduce female characterisation to \u201can actress noodling around in a T-shirt looking fruity\u201d, Greig says. By making the protagonist a woman, Greig says, the play becomes an experience that transcends the conventions of sci-fi, and instead \u201cforces you to consider grief, desire, time and all the things that I think the book and the [Tarkovsky] film is really about.\u201d There may, of course, be self-aware noodling and T-shirts too \u2013 as befits the low-fi sci-fi analogue aesthetic of the space station on the Malthouse stage. \u201cEarly on, we discussed that we would never see the planet,\u201d Lutton says. \u201cIts presence would be felt.

A freedom of information officer who has worked across federal government blew the whistle internally in late 2017 on what he described as a \u201cculture of disdain for the rule of law\u201d within the prime minister\u2019s department. The whistleblower alleged the department breached FOI law in one of every two requests it received, particularly when the documents were embarrassing or sensitive. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The whistleblower collated 25 examples of FOI requests that had been handled unlawfully, saying they showed a \u201cpolitically-motivated, pervasive, and toxic\u201d disregard for FOI law.

They become the sixth European team into the quarter-finals, where they will play either Japan or the European champions, Holland. 90+1 min: Giugilaini tries to crown Italy\u2019s victory by blasting into the net from long range, but her shot buzzes wide at the near post. 89 min: Italy are heading into the quarter-finals and they will be testing opponents for either Holland or Japan. They attack with verve and defend stoutly. 86 min: Linari, impeccably positioned as always, cuts out another attack. She and Gama have been imperious in the centre of the Italian defence. 84 min: Cernoia sprints down the right as Italy attack for the first time in a while. It peters out quickly, with an aimless cross. China whizz up the other end and fire off an even more aimless shot from 30 yards. File under \u201cclutching lamely at straws\u201d. 82 min: Wang sends over a good corner. Linari leaps highest to head clear. When Cong sends it back in from the left, Zhang heads weakly wide from 10 yards. 81 min: As the Italians fans chant happily in the stands, their team continues to repel China\u2019s earnest attacks with minimum bother. 79 min: A rare lapse by Linari as she allows a long pass to drift over her head. Li Ying runs on to it ... but Linari recovers and wins the ball back at the edge of the box. 77 min: Gama intervenes to boot the ball clear after another bright Chinese attack founders on shoddy control in the area. 75 min: Han chests down the ball at the edge of the Italian area after a corner is half-cleared. But he ensuing shot makes for easy pickings for Giuliani. 73 min: A bad cross from the right ruins a bright Chinese move. 71 min: Some good old-fashioned Italian defending by Linari there, hurling herself in front of shots at the edge of her own box, making important blocks without actually going to ground. Italy substitution: Rosucci on, Bonansea off after a quiet game. 67 min: Gama blocks a shot at the expense of a corner. \u201cI imagine that one could argue that China has technically played a better game,\u201d offers Mary Waltz. \u201cBut the confident spirit of constant attack of the Italians has payed off, at least so far. Yes, at moments the Italians have looked sloppy on defense, but I love the verve they display every time China makes the slightest error.\u201d Yes, and there have been many, many such errors, plus bluntness when it matters in attack - both of which must be classed as rather large technical failings. The keeper was highly suspect on the second goal, too, I fancy. All in all, Italy deserve to be in front and, as you say, the gusto with which they attack is wonderful. 65 min: Nice move by China, culiminating in tricky footworwk by Wang in the Italian area. But, under pressure, she slips as she makes to shoot, leading to a half-hit effort that trickles into the keeper\u2019s arms. Italy substitution: Mauro on, Bergamaschi off. China susbtitutions: Yao and Song on, Yan Wan and Wang off. With the introduction of a pair of strikers, China signal their intention to go down all guns blazing, if they go down they must. 60 min: Solid defending by Bartoli to sabotage a promising Chinese move. 59 min: Bonansea, who has been remarkably quiet despite all the attackign that Italy have done, tries to make an impact on the game with a blast from distance. But it\u2019s charged down. 57 min: Linari steps in to relieve Li Ying of the ball and launch a counter-attack, which comes to an an end when Bartoli is rumbled for handball. 55 min: Galli sends over a low cross from the left. A poor attempted clearance at the near post sends the ball to Giaciniti, who goes down under a challenge from another defender. Italy want a penalty, and the ref decideds to consult with Var. The review doesn\u2019t take long: China are in the clear. 53 min: \u201cThe Italians were hemmed in largely because they keep making poor choices as soon as they have the ball, or intelligent passes go badly astray,\u201d notes Michael Clark. \u201cThat suggests they\u2019re sagging because of the heat. Their second goal, their first serious threat in about 30 minutes camesfrom a recent sub, and after a few moments of play in which Italy made few such blunders.\u201d True, though China do deserve some credit for adding to Italy\u2019s frazzled state-of-mind with much-improved attacking in the second part of the first half. But they\u2019ll have to do even better if they\u2019re to get back into this tie now. That gives Italy the breathing space they needed. Galli received the ball in space about 25 yards out and perfectly central. She takes one touch to control it and then sweeps a low shot beyond the keeper and into the net! 47 min: Giuliani play a dicey ball to a defender who didn\u2019t want it, and Li tries to steal in and take it. But she can\u2019t make a clean get away, so the keeper escapes. 46 min: Italy get the second half going. Let\u2019s see what good the break did them... China substitution: Yang Li on, Gu off. \u201cAt yesterday\u2019s pre-match press conference, Italy\u2019s captain Sara Gama was asked - after the Italians reached the round of 16 following a two decade absence from the tournament - \u2018are you suffering from vertigo?\u2019\u201d write Kieran Pender from the Stade de la Mosson. \u201cShe insisted they were not, but the Italians will need to stay down to earth for the next 45 minutes if they are to see off the vastly more experienced China, who have only failed to make the World Cup quarter-finals once.\u201d When Giacinti fired Italy into the lead in the 15th minute, it looked like that would be the first of many goals for the women in blue. But China gradually grew back into the game and began to gain the upperhand in midfield, keep the ball away from their own error-riddled defence and begin to put serious pressure on the Italians, who ended up quite grateful to reach the interval with the lead. It makes for an intriguing second half. 45 + 1 min: Italy look like they need the break as China continue to come on strong... 44 min: Guani has to make a crucial sliding tackle eight yards from her own goal to deny China after some lovely interplay in the box. The threat from China is definitely growing... 42 min: Galli\u2019s first involvement results in a freekick as she upends Han. Wang Yan sends over a decent freekick, which Wang meets seven yards out, and she flicks it against the post! But she was offside. Italy substitution: Galli on, Girelli off, presumably with some strain of injury. 39 min: Dainty work by Li Ying down the right, dodging past the defender before hanging up a decent ball to the back. Italy survive. 38 min: China are exerting serious press now, sending lots of balls into the Italian box. They\u2019re starting to look as dangerous to the opposing at one end as they are to themselves at the other. 36 min: Wang\u2019s corner is cleared at the near post. Liu had a pop from over 25 yards. It bounces in fonrt of Giuliani, who keepers her eye on the ball and holds it safely. 34 min: Gama intercepts another slack Chinese pass and then - from the centre circle, no less - tries to beat Peng. Did she not see that save a moment ago? Well, no need for Peng to do a replay because Gama\u2019s shot drifts way wide. 33 min: Bartoli sends a simple ball from the right-back position over the Chinese defence and into the path of Bergamaschi, who charges into the right-hand side of the box and lets fly. Peng throws herself to her right to make a tremendous full-length save! 32 min: Guiliani hurtles off her line to drop on the ball as Gu tried to latch on to a nice pass from deep. 30 min: Giacinti runs through on a one-on-one with the keeper ... and rolls the ball beyond the far post! She\u2019s disgusted with herself, all the mroe so when she sees that it wouldn\u2019t have counted anyway because she had mistimed her run and was a yard offside. 27 min: Linars strains to head away a Li cross from the right. When the ball breaks to the edge of the area, Yan Wang hits a lovely swirling drive, forcing Giuliani to tip the ball over with one hand. The keeper then comes to claim the corner with confidence. 25 min: \u201cIf China doesn\u2019t button up their back line soon this could get ugly quick,\u201d hollers Mary Waltz. \u201cBut watching Italy\u2019s constant attacking style is a joy. Italian Pirates, who knew.\u201d China are beginning to piece togther some useful moves in the Italian half but yes, they still look alarmingly fragile at the back. But iI\u2019d question your use of the term \u2018ugly\u2019: I, for one, hope that if China don\u2019t make this a tight contest, then Italy make it an absolute wallopping. In such circumstances another 13-0 would be just dandy, if you ask me. 23 min: Li Ying wellies over a useful cross from the right. Gama deals with it. 18 min: Bonansea dispossesses a defender mid-way inside the Chinese half and goes for a through-ball to Giacinti. It doesn\u2019t come off but the Chiense manager will be aghast at the way his team are being bullied by the Italian midfielder and forwards, who have been sharper and stronger from the first minute. 15 min: The goal originated in yet another Chinese mistakes: they are continually coughing up the ball under pressure in their own half. This time Wu was the culprit wide on the left. Peng made a good save at the feet to Bartoli but when the ball rebounded towards the penalty spot, Giacinti was sharpest, beating a defender to it and stabbing home. It had been coming, and Giacinti, in particular, deserved it. 13 min: A blunder by Han to the right of her own box as she passes it straight to Giacinti. The striker tries to take immediate advantage and fire into the net past the out-of-position keeper from 23 yards. But she misses the target and throws her hands to her face in disbelief. It wasn\u2019t the easiest angle, in fairness. 11 min: Girelli opens up the Chinese defence with a nice turn and pass just inside the opposing half. Giacinti slopts it past the keeper with minimum fuss and turns away to celebrate ... util she sees the offside flag. 9 min: Italy are starting to get some joy down the right. This time Bergamaschi lays the ball back for Guagni, who hoiks it into the box from deep. China defend it well. 7 min: Bergmaschi digs out a testing cross from the right. Wu is admirably vigilant this time and hooks it away from the edge of the six-yard box. 6 min: Li does well to win the ball wide on the right and goes on a barrelling run into the box. It takes two to stop her breaking through. 3 min: Giuliani floats a diangonal pass from the left towards the six-yard box. Wu decides to let it run through to the keeper, unaware that Giacinti is lurking nearby. Fortunately for the defender, the keeper is more alert and rushes in to grab the bouncing ball. 2 min: Italy pester China into losing possession id-way inside their own half. Girelli tries to thread a pass through to Bonansea, who made an astute run in anticipation of it. But the pass is ever so slightly overhit. 1 min: China complete a succcesful kickoff, unless Var has spotted something requiring a retake. No, it\u2019s all good: the match is under way! The Italians sure aren\u2019t coy singers: they\u2019re belting out their national anthem with mighty gusto. \u201cItaly have been one of the most entertaining teams in this tournament,\u201d reckons Mary Waltz. \u201cIf they can stay patient they will eventually break down the Chinese and advance.\u201d I\u2019m torn between wanting an early goal to open the game and wanting it to remain tight and scoreless for many agonising minutes, just to see how tetchy certain players become, with the oppressive heat adding to the tension. \u201cIt has been a sweltering day in Montpellier, as the European heatwave begins to be felt,\u201d writes Kieran Prender from the Stade de la Mosson. \u201cThankfully the media tribune is nicely shaded, but the players are receiving an afternoon roasting as they warm up. China have had an extra day\u2019s rest, and that could make all the different in this warm weather.\u201d Italy: Giuliani; Guagni, Gama, Linari, Bartoli; Bergamaschi, Giugliano, Cernoia; Giacinti, Girelli, Bonansea Subs: Galli, Rosucci, Parisi, Sabatino, Marchitelli, Tarenzi, Serturini, Fusetti, Boattin, Mauro, Tucceri Cimini, Pipitone China: Peng; Han, Wu, Lin, Liu; Sh Sh Wang, Zhang, Yan Wang, Gu; Wang, Li Subs: Xu, Lou, Li, Yang, Wang, Song, Li, Bi, Tan, Yao, Luo Liu Referee: EA Batista (Brazil) Hello and welcome to this last 16 showdown in Montpellier. The winners will face a quarter-final against either Holland or Japan. The smart money must be on Italy, who got there by topping a group that also featured Brazil, Australia and Jamaica and benefit from having a gaggle of Juventus players, including the nifty striker Barbara Bonansea. But China won\u2019t be easy to break down: they only lost 1-0 to Germany in the group stages and held Spain to 0-0 draw after edging past South Africa 1-0. They\u2019ll be looking to try to keep this one tight, while Italy will be hellbent on blowing them away. Whose wish will come true? That\u2019s what we\u2019re here to find out. It\u2019s on!",

If that were the case, we would see high-level delegations, for example, going to the Bahraini workshop. Instead, Arab states are trying to send as low-level diplomats as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Sir John Jenkins, a former Middle East director for the Foreign Office, said torpor across Palestinian politics had contributed to a loss of faith in the existing peace model.</p> <p>He said Palestine\u2019s political structure had collapsed and there was \u201cno Palestinian national narrative any more\u201d, pointing to the \u201cbureaucratisation and demoralisation of Fatah\u201d, the \u201cfutilely belligerent\u201d Hamas in charge of Gaza, and the fact that the Palestinian Authority that runs parts of the West Bank was \u201cwidely distrusted and despised as corrupt by many Palestinians\u201d.</p> <p>Jenkins said: \u201cAdd to this the failure of the Arab uprisings, the consequent discrediting of political Islamism, the collapse of Arab nationalism and the rise of securitised authoritarianism, and the old context within which the Palestinian national cause sat has also vanished. No one has replaced it with anything satisfactory. This is a failure of the political imagination.\u201d</p> <p>He said this vacuum had been filled with \u201cthe promise of economic development, as if that will make the unorganised but still widespread and powerful Palestinian yearning for a state, or at least a political community, go away. I think that\u2019s a misreading. Economic development gets you so far \u2013 but then what?\u201d</p> <p>He added of mooted Arab benefactors: \u201cI can\u2019t see them simply signing on the dotted line unless there is some sort of political horizon. The Palestinian issue retains a distinctive power to mobilise many Arabs emotionally. It\u2019s hard to see why the Kurds and others are allowed to realise national aspirations but not the Palestinians. And Iran would accuse them of selling out the instant they signed. Why give them the satisfaction?\u201d</p> <p>Hellyer said a two-state solution, already diluted, may become even less viable in the absence of meaningful political engagement. \u201cIf the Israelis continue along this present course of action, they make the alternative of a one-state solution more and more inevitable, where the Palestinian struggle for national self-determination in a state is transformed into a civil rights struggle in a single state alongside Israelis.\u201d </p>",

Instead, Arab states are trying to send as low-level diplomats as possible.\u201d Sir John Jenkins, a former Middle East director for the Foreign Office, said torpor across Palestinian politics had contributed to a loss of faith in the existing peace model. He said Palestine\u2019s political structure had collapsed and there was \u201cno Palestinian national narrative any more\u201d, pointing to the \u201cbureaucratisation and demoralisation of Fatah\u201d, the \u201cfutilely belligerent\u201d Hamas in charge of Gaza, and the fact that the Palestinian Authority that runs parts of the West Bank was \u201cwidely distrusted and despised as corrupt by many Palestinians\u201d. Jenkins said: \u201cAdd to this the failure of the Arab uprisings, the consequent discrediting of political Islamism, the collapse of Arab nationalism and the rise of securitised authoritarianism, and the old context within which the Palestinian national cause sat has also vanished. No one has replaced it with anything satisfactory. This is a failure of the political imagination.\u201d He said this vacuum had been filled with \u201cthe promise of economic development, as if that will make the unorganised but still widespread and powerful Palestinian yearning for a state, or at least a political community, go away. I think that\u2019s a misreading. Economic development gets you so far \u2013 but then what?\u201d He added of mooted Arab benefactors: \u201cI can\u2019t see them simply signing on the dotted line unless there is some sort of political horizon. The Palestinian issue retains a distinctive power to mobilise many Arabs emotionally. It\u2019s hard to see why the Kurds and others are allowed to realise national aspirations but not the Palestinians. And Iran would accuse them of selling out the instant they signed. Why give them the satisfaction?\u201d Hellyer said a two-state solution, already diluted, may become even less viable in the absence of meaningful political engagement. \u201cIf the Israelis continue along this present course of action, they make the alternative of a one-state solution more and more inevitable, where the Palestinian struggle for national self-determination in a state is transformed into a civil rights struggle in a single state alongside Israelis.\u201d",

We\u2019ve played some good cricket so far. England are a stand-out side who can take you apart, so it was nice that we found ways to keep getting wickets in the middle of the innings. Jason Behrendorff bowled beautifully; every time he was called upon he picked up wickets. Nathan Lyon didn\u2019t get the rewards but he was brilliant.</p> \n  <p>\u201cDavey is playing nicely. People say it\u2019s not the Warner of old but there have been some wickets in this tournament that have demanded a bit more respect, and we\u2019ve tried to sum up the conditions as quickly as we can every time.

The next few hours will tell us plenty about their mental state. Despite an excellent comeback in the second half of the Australian innings, England have a stiff target of 286 to chase. I\u2019d make the Aussies slight favourites.<br></p> \n  <p>If England succeed, we can breathe easily for a few days. If they fail, there will be panic on the streets of London, Birmingham, Carlisle, Humberside, and indeed everywhere else in England. This could be a pulsating runchase. Starc, Cummins, Lyon; Bairstow, Morgan, Stokes. The next 50 overs should come with a testosterone warning.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d121c698f081e872734e75e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/geoff-lemon\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-25T13:10:32.229Z\">2.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">England will need 286 to win</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That was a brilliant finish from Carey under trying circumstances. But Australia will still feel well short of where they should have been after another huge opening stand and a substantial platform. It has been a consistent issue during Australia\u2019s campaign, but the quality of their bowling has been enough to compensate for it.</p> \n  <p>That\u2019s what they\u2019ll need again today: Starc and Cummins to break through early, Lyon to do the job through the middle. England bowled well, with wickets shared around between everyone but Rashid, who bowled economically and helped keep things under control. When Finch was hitting sixes off the spinners in the middle of the innings, it could have been a different story.</p> \n  <p>England will be batting in about 25 minutes, so please direct your correspondence to Rob Smyth from this point on.

Sydney calling first up to set the scene ahead of today\u2019s hugely-anticipated meeting at Lord\u2019s, before handing over to London for the start of play (10:30am local, 7:30pm AEST). It hardly needs hyping, such is the, um, special relationship between these two countries, but the fact that this gives England fans a chance to remind their antipodean cousins of the time Australian cricket imploded in Cape Town 15 months ago is sure to only add even more heat to an already five-chilli occasion.</p> \n  <p>But it\u2019s not just about two very naughty boys seeking a kind of redemption and some inevitably cheap jokes emanating from the stands today. There\u2019s a Cricket World Cup on, and with just two points separating the sides heading into this fixture, there\u2019s table position to play for. Australia sit in second on 10 points, with England fourth on eight, both having played six games. An Australian win will see them leapfrog New Zealand into top spot and put a huge dent in England\u2019s hopes of reaching the semis; defeat will see England draw level on points. First place plays fourth and second plays third in the semis.</p> \n  <p>Anyway, please do feel free to get in touch with any thoughts on today\u2019s match. I\u2019ll try to field any emails before handing over to Geoff for the first ball.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s blog. It\u2019s been a marvellous day for Australia and a chastening one for England. I\u2019ll leave you with our match report from Lord\u2019s. Thanks for your company and emails; I\u2019m off to live in the woods for a couple of years. Bye! The thoroughly impressive Aaron Finch speaks again \u201cThat\u2019s the first part ticked off, reaching the semi-finals. We\u2019ve played some good cricket so far. England are a stand-out side who can take you apart, so it was nice that we found ways to keep getting wickets in the middle of the innings. Jason Behrendorff bowled beautifully; every time he was called upon he picked up wickets. Nathan Lyon didn\u2019t get the rewards but he was brilliant. \u201cDavey is playing nicely. People say it\u2019s not the Warner of old but there have been some wickets in this tournament that have demanded a bit more respect, and we\u2019ve tried to sum up the conditions as quickly as we can every time. He was really close to his best today.\u201d Eoin Morgan speaks \u201cWe were outplayed. I thought we bowled really well up front and they played and missed a lot. They had a fantastic partnership up front and posted a good total. We felt the wicket got a little bit better, although it was still challenging. Losing early wickets isn\u2019t ideal and pegged us back quite substantially. \u201cGiven the circumstances, it\u2019s not hugely disappointing to lose. Our fate is in our own hands with the next two games we play. Everything we need to turn around is quite simple \u2013 we\u2019re not going to search for something that isn\u2019t there. The basics have let us down in the last two games.\u201d Read it and weep uncontrollably (if you\u2019re an England fan) The Man of the Match is the irritatingly likeable Aaron Finch \u201cI didn\u2019t play too badly. Any time you contribute to a win, it\u2019s nice. We got through that new-ball spell and set a reasonable foundation. It was nipping around, so we tried to rein it in and be as tight as we could be, and then just cash in on any width.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been checking the OBO in between meeting the members of Kiss (who don\u2019t have any opinions about the cricket, incredibly),\u201d says Michael Hann. \u201cGreat that the England cricket team have noted the men\u2019s football team\u2019s transformation into loveable overachievers and decided to occupy their old role as the Golden Generation Who Can\u2019t Justify The Pre-Tournament Hype. English sport needs that team, and I for one am proud the cricketers have stepped up. I\u2019m hoping for six autobiographies the minute the World Cup ends.\u201d Presumably with Alex Hales in the Joey Barton role. The game was won and lost with the new balls. Australia bowled and batted with intelligence and focus; England, not so much. Read all about it. I double dare you Australia move into the semi-finals with two games to spare. England move into the last-chance saloon. Starc gets his fourth wicket, with Rashid driving to extra cover, to complete a thumping victory for Australia. That\u2019s their best performance of the tournament, one that brooks not a solitary argument from anyone connected with England. Three of their Big Five stood up again \u2013 Finch, Warner and Starc \u2013 while the surprise selection Jason Behrendorff had the game of his life. WICKET! England 221 all out (Rashid c Stoinis b Starc 25) 44th over: England 213-9 (Rashid 17, Wood 1) Jason Behrendorff finishes with figures of 10-0-44-5, and memories that will keep him warm in his dotage. His boyish smile is lovely to see. \u201cRob,\u201d says Brian Withington (42nd over). \u201cShall I take that as a no, then?\u201d If you want to twist my words, there\u2019s not much I can do... It\u2019s Jason Behrendorff who gets the five-for! Archer drives flat and hard towards long-off, where Warner takes a good running catch. When Channel 5 run 50 Most Inspired Selection on a Saturday night, Behrendorff will be part of the discussion. 43rd over: England 210-8 (Rashid 16, Archer 1) Starc goes around the wicket, hunting the two wickets that would give him another five-for. He deserves one, for he has been immense today \u2013 he\u2019s taken three big wickets (Root, Morgan, Stokes), all with either brilliant deliveries or superb planning. \u201cBah!\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cWe\u2019re just going to have to invent a new format of the game - though that\u2019d be ridiculous wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d 42nd over: England 207-8 (Rashid 14, Archer 0) \u201cIs it time,\u201d says Brian Withington, \u201cto think about protecting Net Run Rate?\u201d It\u2019s a good question. I suppose my response would bE THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING ABOUT PROTECTING THE EFFING FAST BOWLERS BY NOW, NOT NET BLOODY RUN RATE IN THE HOPE FOUR TEAMS MIGHT DO A SIMULTANEOUS DEVON LOCH AND LET US SNEAK THROUGH WITH FOUR DEFEATS! WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FARCE IS GOING ON! MOTHER CRICKET, FATHER CRICKET, WHOEVER YOU ARE, YOU CAN STICK YOUR WISDEN 2019 RIGHT IN THE BLOCKHOLE, I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS. WHERE WERE YOU AT 3AM ON 28 JANUARY 2018 WHEN ENGLAND WERE PLAYING ANOTHER ODI, EH? I WAS BLOODY OBOING, AND IT WAS THE MORNING AFTER MY BIRTHDAY AS WELL. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMATOSE! IT WAS ALL PART OF THE \u201cJOURNEY\u201d, YOU SAID, YOU\u2019LL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK ON IT FONDLY AFTER THE WORLD CUP, WHEN THE \u201cJOURNEY\u201d IS COMPLETE. YEAH, THE JOURNEY FROM THE GUTTER TO THE STARS AND BACK AGAIN! THANKS A BUNCH! Great fielding from Glenn Maxwell. Woakes slog swept Behrendorff to cow corner, where Maxwell took the catch and got rid of the ball before his momentum took him over the ropes. Finch was there to complete the relay catch. 41st over: England 200-7 (Woakes 25, Rashid 9) Rashid cuffs Lyon down the ground for six. A gold star for him. 40th over: England 191-7 (Woakes 23, Rashid 1) Moeen Ali has gone, caught behind off a good-length delivery from the new bowler Behrendorff. That\u2019s his third wicket. 39th over: England 184-6 (Woakes 21, Ali 2) Starc is getting a bit of inswing to the left-handers, which makes him even deadlier. When you consider the context, that ball to Stokes might be the best of the tournament so far. He concedes only one run from the seventh over, and not even an advert for the Hounslow branch of Pepe\u2019s Chick\u2019n\u2019Rice between overs can cheer me up. Kumar knew. 38th over: England 183-6 (Woakes 20, Ali 2) So, Australia have qualified for the semi-finals with two matches to spare. England need to win their last two games, away to India and against New Zealand in Durham, to ensure they go through to the semi-final. They might get there with one victory, but they would need a few favours from elsewhere - starting with a New Zealand win over Pakistan tomorrow. 37th over: England 177-6 (Woakes 18, Ali 0) Stokes kicked his bat in frustration when he heard the ball clip the stumps. He played a glorious innings, but Starc was too good. Sensational bowling from Mitchell Starc! Absolutely perfect! He has ended Ben Stokes\u2019 heroic innings with an unplayable inswinging yorker. That wicket, in the first over of a new spell, was delivered as if to order. It was a phenomenal piece of bowling. 36th over: England 173-5 (Stokes 88, Woakes 15) England are targeting Cummins, simply because there is pace on the ball. Stokes charges his first ball, flat-batting it through cover point for four, and smashes the third through extra cover for another boundary. It was in the air but wide of the diving Lyon. Woakes completes an excellent over by dumping a pull through midwicket for four more. Here\u2019s Simon McMahon, whose email has the subject: \u2018Straws\u2019. \u201cIf England scrape though after beating New Zealand, possibly via NRR, they will be so delighted/relieved that they will probably relax, get their mojo back and go and win the whole goddam thing. It\u2019s coming home, Rob.\u201d 35th over: England 160-5 (Stokes 79, Woakes 11) Four singles from Lyon\u2019s over. It looks pretty difficult for the batsmen to put pace on the old ball. \u201cThat Notts match, and particularly that last ball, is my happiest cricketing memory,\u201d says Louise Wright. \u201cThanks for the link. As I recall it, the fielder\u2019s hat fell off as he went in desperate pursuit of the ball. Please don\u2019t correct me if I\u2019m wrong, the version in my head is so much more aesthetically pleasing than reality. Or at least as much as anything involving Eddie Hemmings &amp; Bruce French as they were in 1989 could be aesthetically pleasing.\u201d Bruce French is about four times sexier now than he was in 1989. You can\u2019t say that of many men, but we do our best to cope. 34th over: England 156-5 (Stokes 77, Woakes 9) Cummins, on for Stoinis, is flicked crisply for four by the hitherto strokeless Woakes. The extra pace is good for England, for now at least; Stokes drags a pull for four to make it nine from the over. Whatever happens \u2013 and I think we all know how this ends \u2013 it has been an exceptional innings from Stokes. \u201cThanks for the OBO commentary,\u201d says Milind Pania. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way to kill time at work in Berlin. The Germans don\u2019t even know there is a World Cup on since cricket isn\u2019t available on free-to-air TV. As an Indian who has been painfully disappointed by the antics of the BCCI and Indian TV channels, I have cheered on the Black Caps for over 4 years now, England could take a leaf out of their book as to how to chase down a total in difficult conditions. Or at least out of Kane Williamson\u2019s book. Stokes apart, this is painful to watch (read?).\u201d I can confirm the experience of pain. 33rd over: England 147-5 (Stokes 73, Woakes 4) Lyon replaces Maxwell, and Stokes limps his way through a single to mid-on. It might be cramp, apparently. That run is one of only two from the over, and the required rate goes up to 8.17 as a result. \u201cI wonder,\u201d says Steven Salter, \u201chow Alex Hales feels watching this.\u201d 32nd over: England 145-5 (Stokes 72, Woakes 3) Another very useful over from Stoinis, with just four singles from it. England need 141 from 18 overs. It\u2019s a no from me. \u201cEngland have been exulted as the favourites going into this WC and chief of chiefs Jos B as their talisman of big hitting uber batsmen,\u201d says Pete. \u201cHas he even got past 30 this World Cup yet for England?\u201d No. The umpires have called for a drink Here\u2019s something to read with your schooner of neat brandy. 31st over: England 141-5 (Stokes 70, Woakes 1) Stokes has had enough. He belts Maxwell for two sixes in three balls. The first was almost a freebie, from a rank long hop; the second was a flat slog sweep that bisected the two fielders on the boundary. Stokes has played jolly well. \u201cIt seems chasing is very much not the way to go at this World Cup,\u201d says Thomas Whiteley. \u201cEngland failed against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and look likely to fail now, after being considered chasers par excellence before\u2026what gives? It seems India are smarter in that regard, maybe?\u201d Virat knows. 30th over: England 129-5 (Stokes 58, Woakes 1) Steve Smith misses another run-out chance, this time from midwicket with Woakes well short of his ground. On this slow pitch, England have struggled to punish Australia\u2019s fifth bowler - between them, Stoinis and Maxwell have figures of 7-0-28-1. 29th over: England 128-5 (Stokes 57, Woakes 1) Glenn Maxwell replaces Nathan Lyon, who is being saved for Moeen Ali, and gets through a cheap over - three from it. England need 158 from 126 balls. They are running out of overs, wickets and hope. But apart from that... \u201cWhy didn\u2019t England prepare pitches like this for the Pakistan series in May?\u201d says Alex Teakle. \u201cIf Kohli knew what the pitches would be like, why not England?\u201d You know, that\u2019s an exceedingly good point. I think they thought they had cracked it. That said, I still think their defeats in this World Cup have had more to do with pressure - and decades of rubble in the collective subconscious - than pitches. 28th over: England 125-5 (Stokes 55, Woakes 0) On the plus side, if England win the next four games they\u2019ll win the World Cup! Chris Woakes comes in ahead of Moeen Ali, who has been Nathan Lyon\u2019s bunny. Buttler flicked Stoinis wristily behind square, and for a split-second it looked like the ball was going for six. He didn\u2019t get enough on it, however, and Khawaja ran round the boundary to take a beautiful two-handed catch. Buttler goes for 25 from 27 balls; England are going to lose this game. What a brilliant catch from Usman Khawaja! 27th over: England 122-4 (Stokes 53, Buttler 25) Buttler makes room to slash Lyon behind square for a couple, with the indefatigable Cummins sprawling to save the boundary. Five from the over. \u201cHi there Rob,\u201d says Sandile Xaso. \u201cAustralia imposing themselves on every opponent without ever really clicking is extremely worrying. But really, it\u2019s difficult to root against a team that has a high-class performer like Pat Cummins. He gives batsmen nothing, bowling a tight, testing line at +145 km/h AND bounce. He tries as hard with the first delivery of a practice match as he will on day five of a dead Test having bowled 21 overs in the baking sun. Outstanding cricketer.\u201d Yes, he\u2019s the definition of a champion, and such an admirable character. It\u2019s also easy to forget the years of misery he went through. Stokes has his calf massaged between overs, and takes the opportunity to wolf down a banana. 26th over: England 117-4 (Stokes 51, Buttler 22) Stokes whips Stoinis for a single to reach an admirable half-century: 75 balls, five fours, umpteen grimaces. He is really struggling with his leg, possibly his calf. Buttler, meanwhile, ends a frustrating spell of mistimed strokes with a savage thump through mid-on for four. 25th over: England 109-4 (Stokes 49, Buttler 16) Stokes chips Lyon down the ground for four. Finch ran in from mid-on, at first thinking there might be the opportunity of a catch, but it bounced short and then ran away from him to the boundary. Lyon replies impressively with five dot balls, including a fine delivery that beats Stokes\u2019s attempted cut. England need 177 from the second half of their innings to win. 24th over: England 105-4 (Stokes 45, Buttler 16) Stokes flicks Stoinis for a single to bring up a level-headed fifty partnership from 58 balls. England have actually played pretty well since that desperate start, but Stokes and Buttler have been left with so much to do. The pitch looks slow and awkward; Buttler in particular has mistimed a number of strokes. \u201cIn Full Match Awareness, Father Time suddenly comes to life and taps departing batsmen on the shoulder, after which they are seen no more,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cWhat will happen at the end to the Not Out player?\u201d He is revealed as Keyser Soze? 23rd over: England 102-4 (Stokes 43, Buttler 16) Lyon replaces Cummins (5-1-14-0) and is swept very hard for four by Stokes. He is playing beautifully, but he he grimaced as he came up from that sweep. He seems to have pulled something in his leg. Great, nice one. \u201cBilateral track bullies,\u201d says Ian Copestake, through the tears. 22nd over: England 97-4 (Stokes 38, Buttler 16) Another reprieve for Buttler, who is short of his ground when Smith\u2019s underarm throw just misses the stumps. England are living so dangerously. \u201cHere\u2019s an angle for you to ponder,\u201d says William Matthewman. \u201cI vividly remember watching Bob Willis extoling the virtues of Jos Butler as a World Cup opener on Sky Sports a few weeks ago and was convinced he\u2019d lost his mind. However, I can now see him fitting perfectly into the role in Roy\u2019s absence. He\u2019d either have gone cheaply today (Vince-esque) or taken this game, and all the early sting, away from the Aussies quickly.\u201d Yes, if England lose today they may get funky for the India game, if Jason Roy is still unfit. But that would be perceived as panic, and it would also leave them with a porcelain middle order. Personally I would leave Buttler where he is, though I might open with Moeen. Australia appeal unsuccessfully for LBW against Jos Buttler, and then waste their review. It was a poor review because Buttler was a long way down the pitch. Replays showed the ball hit him outside the line, which means Australia lose their review. 21st over: England 93-4 (Stokes 36, Buttler 15) A quiet over from Cummins; two from it. The required rate (6.65) isn\u2019t yet an issue for England. \u201cBilateral series is the new metatarsal,\u201d says Daniel Harris. \u201cAnyone got Uri Geller\u2019s digits?\u201d What\u2019s Jason Roy\u2019s hamstring, then? Bryan Robson\u2019s shoulder? 20th over: England 91-4 (Stokes 35, Buttler 14) Marcus Stoinis comes into the attack in place of Starc. Stokes again runs down the track, this time to blast a fine boundary over mid-on. If England can bully Australia\u2019s fifth bowler, and hit their 10 overs for around 200, they will still have a chance. \u201c\u201cThis,\u201d says Sumit Rahman, \u201cseems an ideal situation for Moeen Ali to come in and play one of those gritty, carefully paced innings we know he loves to make, using full match awareness.\u201d Full Match Awareness is a great name for a film. A cricket-themed horror movie, probably. 19th over: England 83-4 (Stokes 30, Buttler 11) Pat Cummins replaces Nathan Lyon. Stokes, on the charge, plays a spectacular swivel pull that races through midwicket for four. This observation will doubtless end in tears, but so far Stokes has played with admirable intelligence and determination. \u201cI wonder how Jos will cope with this uniquely 2007 situation of being 70-odd for four chasing 285. They\u2019ve had advice from power hitters, fitness gurus, nutritionists, yoga experts, but the man in this situation the most was Jamie \u2018Boom Boom\u2019 Dalrymple. I wonder if he was consulted?\u201d Never mind consulting him. Ask him if he fancies opening the batting on Sunday for my local team, England. 18th over: England 79-4 (Stokes 26, Buttler 11) Stokes is batting with a lot of commonsense, dealing almost exclusively in low-risk ones and twos. I\u2019m sure he will want to hang around and take the game as deep as possible. \u201c\u2018Flat Track Bullies\u2019 is an ugly clich\u00e9 and an ugly description,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cBut it might be the right one\u201d They had improved, at least to my eyes, on awkward pitches. But I suppose that was in bilateral series. 17th over: England 72-4 (Stokes 20, Buttler 10) Buttler is beaten by a big-spinning delivery from Lyon that bounces through the gate and over middle stump. \u201cThis,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan, \u201cprobably sums things up as well as anything.\u201d Usually it\u2019s the perfect summary of English cricket, but I\u2019m not sure on this occasion. I was enjoying the hope; I was coping with it quite nicely. 16th over: England 65-4 (Stokes 14, Buttler 10) Starc replaces Behrendorff, presumably with the remit to get Buttler before he gets in. Buttler drives sweetly for four and then edges a looser drive in the air through gully. \u201c\u2018If they fail to reach the semis, it would easily be England\u2019s worst World Cup campaign and arguably the worst for any country,\u2019\u201d says Richard Mansell, quoting an earlier entry. \u201cAhem. South Africa, 2019.\u201d Each to their own, and I\u2019m probably being a bit one-eyed, but I think it would be an unprecedented humiliation. 15th over: England 57-4 (Stokes 13, Buttler 3) I thought it was a huge toss to win this morning. It wasn\u2019t; it was a great toss to lose. But that shouldn\u2019t disguise the fact Australia have so far outplayed England to an alarming degree. \u201cI\u2019m over this World Cup already,\u201d says Alex. \u201cI wanted some r&amp;r through the group stages but I\u2019m instead through my Kalms prescription. I for one think The Hundred is going to be good! It\u2019ll be the gateway drug for Test cricket, mark my words!\u201d Out of interest, how many Kalms have you taken in the last four hours? Because those last two sentences remind me of Anthony Joshua\u2019s interview after he\u2019d been pounded about the head. 14th over: England 54-4 (Stokes 12, Buttler 1) \u201cAustralia are bowling a lot of no balls,\u201d says Josh Brooks, \u201cbut the umpires are not picking it up.\u201d Really? Are you basing that on TV pictures or are you at the ground? Have our brave bilateral boys been robbed? For the love of Vince Wells. England have lost another wicket. Bairstow swats a short ball from Behrendorff high towards deep midwicket, where Cummins takes his second excellent running catch. That was not the most judicious piece of batting. 13th over: England 52-3 (Bairstow 27, Stokes 11) Nathan Lyon, who is making his World Cup debut, comes on to replace Behrendorff (6-0-26-1). I think he\u2019s a really clever inclusion, such is his record and relish for playing against England. Stokes, surprised by the same nasty bounce that did for Warner, cuts the ball in the air through the vacant point region. Then he plays a reverse sweep that is stopped by Smith at slip. Five from the over; three singles and a two. \u201cI confess to finding a certain comfort in today\u2019s performance,\u201d says Alex Adams. \u201cA poor England batting display, to me, is as much of a childhood memory as a 99 flake by the beach, or sitting in bank holiday traffic somewhere just outside Truro. A modern, competent England has never sat well with me.\u201d Yes, but you have to embrace adulthood eventually. For heaven\u2019s sake, I haven\u2019t even used a dummy since 2016. 12th over: England 47-3 (Bairstow 26, Stokes 7) Stokes is beaten, trying to cut a ball from Cummins that was a bit too close for the shot. Four from the over. This pair are doing okay, but there\u2019s a long way to go: 239 in 38 overs, to be precise. \u201cCan we just agree,\u201d says Zaf Ayub, \u201cthat England will never win a meaningful global tournament in any sport (discounting the under-age footy ones)? Then we can get on with a life that is dreadful enough without unrealistic hopes.\u201d That\u2019s the best idea I\u2019ve heard all tournament. 11th over: England 43-3 (Bairstow 25, Stokes 4) Behrendorff continues, which makes sense while the ball is swinging occasionally. For the second time in many overs he gets one to burst from a length at Stokes, which suggests a bit of uneven bounce. Stokes responds by running down the pitch to drive sweetly through extra cover for four. Those are the first runs of his innings from the 12th delivery. This is very foppin tense. \u201cI wonder, how do we get suckered into this?\u201d says Sara Torvalds. \u201cEvery World Cup, it\u2019s the same thing. This time, this time, will be different. Except it\u2019s not. Either we go into the World Cup off a fine run of form (much good that does us now!) or we\u2019re the underdogs, but the end result is always the same. Disappointment. This time the disappointment just began even sooner than anyone was prepared for. And - horror of horrors! - there\u2019s a home Ashes series coming up too. Just pile on the misery, will you!\u201d Don\u2019t worry. If England cock this up, the Ashes will be cancelled indefinitely, as will all cricket. 10th over: England 39-3 (Bairstow 25, Stokes 0) Cummins jags one back into Bairstow, who flicks it authoritatively through midwicket for four. That was a lovely shot. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be alarmist,\u201d says Pete Salmon, \u201cbut this seems like one of those moments in English cricket - lose today, tumble out of the World Cup having put every egg in that basket for four years, collapse in the Ashes against a rejuvenated Australia, and end up using 42 players until its Sir Alastair Cook and Martyn Moxon opening in the fifth Test trying to avoid a whitewash. Early days I know, but that\u2019s how it feels.\u201d We\u2019ll always have The Hundred. 9th over: England 35-3 (Bairstow 21, Stokes 0) Bairstow, having missed a lusty swipe at the previous ball, forces Behrendorff nicely through extra cover for four. He has continued to attack; Stokes looks like he wants to play himself in. \u201cThere\u2019s a parallel between England\u2019s World Cup performances and Bruce Springsteen albums,\u201d says Richard O\u2019Hagan. \u201cThey come around about once every four years and since 1992 none of them have lived up to the hype.\u201d This is no time for dry humour. 8th over: England 30-3 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 0) A bit of respite for England, as Mitchell Starc is replaced by Pat Cummins, and Stokes, on the walk, is beaten by a good delivery angled across him. A maiden. Some excellent analysis from Nasser Hussain on Sky, which highlights both how well Australia have bowled and how abysmal England were with the new ball. Australia have been much fuller, essentially, and that length brought the first two wickets. \u201cThis is one of those very rare moments,\u201d says Phil Harrison, \u201cwhen I\u2019m quite glad cricket isn\u2019t on free-to-air telly.\u201d It\u2019s okay, the highlights are on at 4.15am tomorrow morning, just after a repeat of a repeat of a repeat of Naked Attraction. 7th over: England 30-3 (Bairstow 16, Stokes 0) Bairstow clumps Behrendorff just over the leaping Finch at mid-off and away for four. That was almost a hideous dismissal. \u201cI hate using this term now that Jeremy Hunt has started to use it but we\u2019re going to bottle it aren\u2019t we?\u201d says Aejaz Shaikh. \u201cWhere would this rank on the list of England\u2019s biggest WC bottlejobs? It must be at the top, because we\u2019ve actually got a decent team this time.\u201d If they fail to reach the semis, it would easily be England\u2019s worst World Cup campaign and arguably the worst for any country. I still think Australia 1992 was the most unlikely flop, but it faded into the background when they went on to win three in a row from 1999-2007. 6th over: England 26-3 (Bairstow 12, Stokes 0) Right, look. One win from the last three games might be enough for England to get through, but it would leave them seriously vulnerable to twists of fate and/or India accidentally losing their final match to Sri Lanka to ensure a theoretically easier semi-final. This is very serious. Eoin Morgan dies by the sword. He tried to pull a short ball from Starc that was on him too quickly and flew off the top edge. It sailed towards fine leg, where Cummins ran round the boundary and took a superb catch. 5th over: England 21-2 (Bairstow 7, Morgan 4) A bit of a statement from Morgan, who gets off the mark by charging down the track to hammer Behrendorff through mid-off for four. He did that, charging the fast bowlers, in the Champions Trophy as well. It looks like he\u2019s not going to die wondering. \u201cJames Vince, ODI average of 26.5 - is he really the best opening batsman understudy in England?\u201d asks Joe Hunt. \u201cSeems incredible that he gets chance after chance for England.\u201d No, he isn\u2019t, but the best understudy has been as stupid off the field as Vince has on it. I\u2019m sure Sam Billings would also have been ahead of Vince had he been fit. After that, there aren\u2019t many credible options. 4th over: England 15-2 (Bairstow 7, Morgan 0) Eoin Morgan is beaten second ball, wafting loosely outside off stump. He counter-attacked majestically in a not dissimilar situation against Australia at the Champions Trophy two years ago. But England had qualified for the semi-finals then and, though they wanted to eliminate Australia, there was nothing like the same pressure. A wicket maiden from Starc. Root has been trapped LBW by a lovely full-length inswinger from Starc. It was so plumb that he barely stopped to discuss a review with Bairstow. England have been plunged into a nightmare. And now we have a problem. 3rd over: England 15-1 (Bairstow 7, Root 8) Bairstow has started a little nervously but that\u2019s a fine shot, a clip between mid-on and midwicket for four off Behrendorff. \u201cSo two bowlers who like to swing the ball into the right hander &amp; an opening batsman who leaves a gate open wide enough for Alastair Cook to drive his combine harvester through,\u201d weeps Jonathan Taylor. \u201cI reckon England will be two down pretty soon. Like you say though Vince not being caught behind \u2013 every cloud and all that.\u201d On the plus side, if they win today it will feel hella sweet. Jeez, so much depends on the next few hours. 2nd over: England 11-1 (Bairstow 3, Root 8) Mitchell Starc will share the new ball. He felt his hamstring after taking a quick single towards the end of the Australian innings, but he seems okay and is bowling at full pace. Bairstow punches through the covers for two and edges a big drive over the cordon for a single; then Root touches a poor delivery off the pads for four. \u201cWriting from Edinburgh, I am rather reluctantly supporting Australia today,\u201d says Charles. \u201cMostly, this is to give Sri Lanka more to fight for on Friday, when I shall be in the County Durham sunshine. Do you think that the hammering that England gave to the Afgans has done them harm? There is something about winning too easily that can break the stride of a team.\u201d Well, I think they were complacent against Sri Lanka (I think we all were), but I\u2019m not sure that had much to do with how easily they beat Afghanistan. I doubt even they know, though their subconscious might. 1st over: England 4-1 (Bairstow 0, Root 4) For England, this is the real quiz. They need a big innings from Root like never before. He gets off the mark with a risky boundary, a back cut that flashes past the diving Maxwell at catchable height. \u201cREQUESTING URGENT JASON ROY UPDATE,\u201d says Matt Simmonds. On the plus side, Vince wasn\u2019t caught at slip. And it was a great delivery from Behrendorff, a classic left-arm swing bowler\u2019s dismissal. Maybe Vince should have had a look before launching into a drive; I don\u2019t know. Goodnight James Vince. He has gone second ball, bowled through the gate by a storming inswinger from Behrendoroff. Here we go. This is thrilling and terrifying in equal measure, and they haven\u2019t bowled a ball yet. The left-armer Jason Behrendorff is going to take the first over. \u201cThis almost feel like this is a harder target to chase than 350 after the last couple of tries,\u201d says James Taylor. \u201cAt least with a higher total they\u2019d have to go full on from the first ball whereas they may take this a bit easier and when the inevitable wickets start tumbling they could leave themselves short. Probably haven\u2019t expressed that very well but you get the gist.\u201d As we\u2019re in a \u201cdigital\u201d age, I\u2019ve recorded a quick vlog with my thoughts on the runchase and England\u2019s World Cup generally. (NB: clip contains adult language) You\u2019d expect the new ball to do plenty, so England will need to play some smart cricket in the first 10 overs. James Vince and Jonny Bairstow will open the batting. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Tense, nervous headache? Yeah, the same. Things have suddenly become a bit too real for England fans, whose beloved bilateral conquerors could be two defeats away from a monumental humiliation. The prospect of them failing to reach the last four is so unthinkable that I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. They could also be five matches away from immortality, so it\u2019s a bit early to panic. The next few hours will tell us plenty about their mental state. Despite an excellent comeback in the second half of the Australian innings, England have a stiff target of 286 to chase. I\u2019d make the Aussies slight favourites. If England succeed, we can breathe easily for a few days. If they fail, there will be panic on the streets of London, Birmingham, Carlisle, Humberside, and indeed everywhere else in England. This could be a pulsating runchase. Starc, Cummins, Lyon; Bairstow, Morgan, Stokes. The next 50 overs should come with a testosterone warning. That was a brilliant finish from Carey under trying circumstances. But Australia will still feel well short of where they should have been after another huge opening stand and a substantial platform. It has been a consistent issue during Australia\u2019s campaign, but the quality of their bowling has been enough to compensate for it. That\u2019s what they\u2019ll need again today: Starc and Cummins to break through early, Lyon to do the job through the middle. England bowled well, with wickets shared around between everyone but Rashid, who bowled economically and helped keep things under control. When Finch was hitting sixes off the spinners in the middle of the innings, it could have been a different story. England will be batting in about 25 minutes, so please direct your correspondence to Rob Smyth from this point on. Thanks for your company today, I\u2019ll see everyone again for the small matter of England v India on Sunday. 50th over: Australia 285-7 (Carey 38, Starc 4) Stokes to finish off for England. Starc squeezes it back to the bowler, who fields and spins to try to run out Carey at the non-striker\u2019s end, but elects to hold onto the ball. Smart play. Carey was diving back for his crease, and had Stokes missed he would certainly have given away four overthrows. Starc manages to get off strike next ball. Carey charges the third, but Stokes drops it short and Carey can\u2019t get anywhere near it. The fourth he does, getting deep in the crease and driving it over cover! Super impressive this tournament, Alex Carey. Times the ball so cleanly, and finds a way. He drags two to deep midwicket and uses every molecule of oxygen in his body to get back and keep strike, then backs away once more to cut through cover for another four! 49th over: Australia 274-7 (Carey 28, Starc 3) There\u2019s one for Carey! Top shot, after Archer starts the over with a wide. Carey expects him to try to hit that return crease, and drives the next attempt well enough to beat the cover sweeper for four. But Archer nails the yorkers thereafter, returning dots and singles. And then that\u2019s an absolutely daft delivery to finish: with third man square and nobody stationed for a catch, he bowls short outside off and Carey slashes it fine for four. 48th over: Australia 263-7 (Carey 19, Starc 2) Mitchell Starc to the middle, and gliding a short ball for a single first ball. But that\u2019s the tone for the over: Australia are collecting ones in the final moments rather than smashing boundaries. \u201cAs an England fan I\u2019m cheered up by the last hour, but Australia\u2019s attempts to accelerate suggest that England\u2019s bish-bash-bosh style might not work on this surface. That makes early wickets vital. I can\u2019t see Starc being as unlucky as Woakes and Archer were,\u201d writes Stephen Cottrell. More pessimists! Can I find someone cheerful in this country? It gets better for England. Good line from Woakes, Cummins pushes just trying to edge to third man, but gets it finer to the keeper who takes a good tumbling catch to his right. Woakes has 2 for 3, in 4 balls. Ah, sequential. 47th over: Australia 259-6 (Carey 17, Cummins 1) Much needed boundary for Australia from Carey, who steps away from Wood\u2019s line and hammers the ball through point. Cummins tries the uppercut when he gets on strike but can\u2019t make contact. The English crowd is finding more voice now than when Finch was bossing it. On another note, I really am bringing this OBO to you from within the head of a terrifying robot overlord. Bow. 46th over: Australia 253-6 (Carey 12, Cummins 0) Reward for Woakes, who bowled so well early. Then picks up a wicket in the slog overs. Smith had to go, but he was very emotional as he came off. Not at all happy with how he hit that one. Patrick Cummins is next out, very good lower-order batsman. But Australia might struggle to get 280 from here. Mate, you\u2019ve just caught the World Cup. Or something along those lines. Smith tries to go large over long-on, gets about half of it, and Archer runs in from the rope to take the catch. 45th over: Australia 248-5 (Smith 38, Carey 8) Wood again, fast again, singles again. England loving this again. Neither batsman can get a full swing at Wood. Carey hares back for a second run after driving wide of long-off, and that\u2019s the productive stroke of the over. 44th over: Australia 242-5 (Smith 36, Carey 4) That\u2019s better for Australia. Five singles from Woakes, just dropping and nudging the ball into the manifold gaps in the field. Everything in the ring is a gap, really. Then Woakes bowls too short to finish the over, and Smith clobbers him for four. \u201cSomeone on the radio just said a batsman has \u2018an average of X against pace and Y against spin\u2019\u201d emails Simon Gates. \u201cWhat does that mean? The batsman would face both pace and spin in an innings, so what does an average against one of them mean?\u201d Well, you can still count the runs scored against a certain kind of bowling, divided by the dismissals. Same theory as general averages. 43rd over: Australia 233-5 (Smith 30, Carey 1) England will be loving this. A wicket here and a wicket there, and Wood\u2019s over goes for only five. The projected score is being revised down as we speak. Where are all those English pessimists who were emailing me earlier? Reveal thyself! 42nd over: Australia 228-5 (Smith 27, Carey 0) Alex Carey in then, who has been a good dasher at the close. Mind you, Matthew Wade just hit the fastest ever List A hundred by an Australian during the Australia A tour a couple of days ago. Ridiculous stuff! Smith works a single to Bairstow at long leg. Stoinis turns and starts sprinting back for a second. Smith not only doesn\u2019t want it, he\u2019s not even thinking about it. He has his back to Stoinis, bat down, not wanting to know. Stoinis would be able to see Smith not moving, surely, but keeps running anyway. And even runs his bat in at the non-striker\u2019s end, next to his teammate, before continuing to walk straight off without looking back. Buttler clips the bails off with Stonis about 30 yards away and growing. 41st over: Australia 222-4 (Smith 22, Stoinis 7) Australia have struggled in this World Cup to turn some big starts into big finishes. Can they go big through the last ten, or can England haul them back? Stoinis gets a very crisp drive away from Wood to the cover boundary. Seven from the over. 40th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 21, Stoinis 1) Slow starter is Stoinis. Can be explosive, but can also leave his team in deficit after gobbling up a lot of deliveries. He takes his time against Rashid to begin with here, before nudging off the mark. Ten overs to come. \u201cI would have thought that the slope benefits the top spinners,\u201d writes Hugh Swanborough. \u201cBeing able to maximize zip off the pitch and get a bit of movement is a nice surprise delivery to have up your sleeve.\u201d 39th over: Australia 213-4 (Smith 20, Stoinis 0) Marcus Stoinis to the middle now, to face Wood with his tail up. 94 miles an hour is the reading on one delivery, as Wood pitches full. Then back of a length to have Stoinis pulling away from the ball, startled. That\u2019s some over. Ouch. Maxwellball was short and furious today. Wood bowls short outside off, Maxwell tries to uppercut, and feathers it through to the keeper. Here comes the frustration at not watching an entertainer at work. We should have an exhibition game one day: Maxwell, 10 overs, unlimited wickets. 38th over: Australia 212-3 (Smith 19, Maxwell 12) Archer steaming in to Maxwell, and... that is absolutely creamed by Maxwell! What a shot! Length ball with pace aplenty, but Maxwell just launches through the line of it and hits it almost 100 metres over the leg side and into the crowd. Next ball? Same shot, one bounce in front of the rope for four. Tucks a single next ball. Exhilarating, against England\u2019s most dangerous bowler. 37th over: Australia 200-3 (Smith 18, Maxwell 1) This is about the first time in this World Cup that Maxwell hasn\u2019t been off the mark with a four or a six. He drives Wood nicely, but straight to mid-off, then takes a sensible single to square leg. He\u2019s got 14 overs to face today, unlike the five or so he\u2019s had in some other matches. Smith drives Wood dead straight for four, then glides fine through third man for another. Like brushing crumbs off his trousers. 200 up. \u201cThe slope at Lord\u2019s will indeed help Rashid turn his googly, if he\u2019s bowling from the pavilion end. Are there any other international grounds with a similar slope?\u201d Hampstead Cricket Club? Not at the top level, that I can think of. Birmingham is a bit of an inverted saucer, isn\u2019t it? 36th over: Australia 190-3 (Smith 9, Maxwell 0) How\u2019s that for an eventful over? Finch\u2019s hundred, and his beaming celebration, arms spread to the dressing room. Finch\u2019s fall the next ball. Archer\u2019s follow-up, a leg-side pie that Smith glances for four. Then Archer\u2019s follow-up to the follow-up, a snorter at Glenn Maxwell that leaps at his grille and is fended away in the air with a flinch. Ton and done! The very next ball, Finch hooks at Jofra Archer, and the Wizard down there at long leg gets a chance at redemption. He takes the catch off the top edge. A misfield at long leg from Woakes, and Finch gets back for his second run. That\u2019s 15 ODI tons for him, behind only Warner, Gilchrist, M. Waugh and Ponting for Australia. 35th over: Australia 183-2 (Finch 98, Smith 4) Stokes takes us up to the drinks break, with Finch knocking a single and Smith steering a couple. \u201cOmens are bad for England today,\u201d writes Dave Seare from the dark tent where he crouches over his chicken bones. \u201cAustralia have brought a truckload of good luck (along with their skill). To compound this they\u2019ve finally selected Nathan Lyon and are denying England a turn at the Zampa buffet. Crucially I\u2019ve run out of milk for brews too.\u201d What... kind of brew has milk in it? Is this a kind of stout? Magic pudding? Wombat stew? 34th over: Australia 178-2 (Finch 96, Smith 1) Archer back into the attack immediately. Is that a pre-set rotation, or does Morgan want him to bowl at Smith before the batsman is set? If so, it doesn\u2019t work, because Finch sprints back for a second run to start the over, then cuts a single at the end to keep strike. 33rd over: Australia 175-2 (Finch 93, Smith 1) You don\u2019t really mind the wicket, do you if you\u2019re Australia? Because it brings Steve Smith to the crease, and he\u2019s exactly the hard-running accumulator you\u2019d like at this stage of an innings. He gets off the mark by driving to deep cover for one. Straight through him! No footwork from Khawaja, he just stood up and drove half-heartedly at Stokes and the ball zips through the gate to take down off stump. Big celebrations from Stokes, surprise surprise. The bowling change comes off. 32nd over: Australia 173-1 (Finch 92, Khawaja 23) Gorgeous from Finch, who is threatening to score another hundred. Rashid gives a lot of flight, the ball drops on a full length, and Finch is there waiting for it like a wolf at the door, licking his chops. He drives it through cover dreamily. 31st over: Australia 166-1 (Finch 88, Khawaja 20) I\u2019m liking this Stokes change. It\u2019s opened up a contest. Finch square drives him gorgeously for what should be four, but Archer does well on the rope to save. Then Stokes zings through a bouncer that Finch can\u2019t get near on the hook. Willing. 30th over: Australia 162-1 (Finch 85, Khawaja 19) Rashid from the Pavilion End, where I suppose the slope would help his googly? Tell me if you know more about this weird angled ground than I. Khawaja is quick to sweep again when the opportunity presents, for a couple more runs. I\u2019m sensing a certain theme in Kanishk Srinivasan\u2019s correspondence. \u201cAt the risk of attracting a lot of hate and online boos, I\u2019m really hoping Australia win this as a neutral (so not really neutral). But England losing here would open the doors ever so slightly for Bangladesh to pop them to that fourth semi-formal spot, which would be amazing. Plus, I think Australia have gone through some self-induced extremely difficult times, so maybe getting to the semis would do them some good. And then they could placate their haters by crashing out by losing to Bangladesh. What say?\u201d 29th over: Australia 158-1 (Finch 84, Khawaja 16) Stokes is back, giving Moeen a break. And perhaps seam is England\u2019s better option just now, with three prodded runs, a couple of miscues, and a ball that jags and beats Finch in a more menacing fashion than anything Moeen sent down. Finch is very capable of monstering spinners on a good day. 28th over: Australia 155-1 (Finch 82, Khawaja 15) Missed stumping! That was a straightforward one for Buttler. Rashid hung the ball up there, drew Khawaja forward, beat his push, and dragged his back foot out. The ball skipped through but hit the heels of Buttler\u2019s hands and bounced back. I don\u2019t think he even really reacted to that ball in time. Khawaja celebrates his reprieve with the exuberance of a man released from prison, reverse-sweeping a four immediately. 27th over: Australia 148-1 (Finch 81, Khawaja 9) Eight more from Moeen\u2019s over, as Finch ends it with an edge to third man for four. Moeen has conceded 42 in 36 balls. 26th over: Australia 141-1 (Finch 76, Khawaja 7) England\u2019s spinners rattling through the overs, as must I. Lots of great emails coming in, thank you all. Rashid concedes a single, then a brace thanks to Root\u2019s misfield. 25th over: Australia 138-1 (Finch 74, Khawaja 6) Singles, singles, the Finch clouts Moeen straight for six! That was such a casual easy swing of the bat. It looked like long-on might be in play for a minute, but the ball sailed over his head. Finch makes it looks simple. 24th over: Australia 129-1 (Finch 67, Khawaja 4) A quiet over from Rashid, with Khawaja sweeping a couple. He does love the sweeps, in all their forms. Big fan of Dick van Dyke. \u201cAt the risk of betraying both of my cricketing prejudices,\u201d warns Brian Withington, \u201cthe only Australian bowler I want to have a good one today is Peter Siddle at Chelmsford.\u201d The great Pierre Siddel. Back him in every time. 23rd over: Australia 125-1 (Finch 66, Khawaja 1) So an eventful over, that one. Finch whacks a couple to cover, then blasts a six over midwicket via his meaty slog-sweep. Loves that shot, getting his front foot well forward, dropping his knees and blasting through the line. Then Warner\u2019s wicket falls, and Usman Khawaja comes out at first drop. Played well last time out against Bangladesh, needs to do it again. Thanks Martin! And thanks Moeen, who finally gets reward for England. It was the bounce wot did it, Your Honour. Width outside off, Warner looks to cut, but the ball leaps on him and takes the top edge, looping tamely to point. The Big Bad Wolf is out, and gets a fair razzing from the crowd as he leaves. Either that or they\u2019re saying \u201cRooooooooot\u201d for the catch. 22nd over: Australia 114-0 (Finch 56, Warner 53) Rashid with this over. Just a couple of singles, but one of them moves Warner from 499 runs to 500 in this edition of the World Cup. Ridiculous numbers really. 21st over: Australia 112-0 (Finch 55, Warner 52) Finally a quiet over for England, as Moeen starts looping his deliveries up, and Finch decides he\u2019s content to be watchful for a few deliveries. Two singles in the end. Martin Sinclair is halfway out the door. \u201cThis has been a difficult morning and I\u2019m wondering whether we\u2019re watching the wheels coming off the England wagon. Yes, we can beat anyone on our day, but we can also lose to anyone and we all know about England\u2019s fabled mental fortitude and ability to grind out wins under pressure. Er... Having followed the morning\u2019s play obsessively up till now, I feel I have to take a break in case it it is my close attention that is jinxing us. I\u2019ll check back in later when hopefully the score is around 154/6. See you then!\u201d Come come, Martin. What happened to that famed Britannia spirit engendered by blue passports or somesuch? I don\u2019t know the details, I\u2019m not from around here. 20th over: Australia 110-0 (Finch 54, Warner 51) The run twins are at it again, with a drive for one from Rashid. Matching fifties, and in such an adorable shade! They look cute. So is Thomas Taylor. \u201cIs there anything better than staying up \u2018til half four in the morning to watch England vs. Australia in a bar in Mexico with your Spanish girlfriend asleep in your arms?\u201d I can\u2019t speak specifically to that experience, Thomas, but I can say that a lot of people have fallen asleep watching cricket with me. 19th over: Australia 106-0 (Finch 52, Warner 49) A couple more runs out to deep midwicket, and Finch has his fifty. In this World Cup he has 66, 6, 36, 82, 153, 53, and now 52 not out. And that 36 he was smashing it but got run out. If you want something more sedate, here\u2019s our county cricket live blog. 18th over: Australia 100-0 (Finch 48, Warner 47) Double spin change, with Adil Rashid\u2019s leg-breaks from the Pavilion End. And Warner goes after him immediately. This must be a plan. First ball, tonked over mid-off for a couple. Third ball, pulled for four. Fifth ball, driving hard past a diving Moeen at mid-off. Ten from the over, all to Warner, and that\u2019s the eighth century partnership in ODIs for this pair, and their third in this World Cup. Australia cruising. 17th over: Australia 90-0 (Finch 48, Warner 37) Moeen versus Warner. This match-up has some history. England\u2019s off-spinner starts up from the Nursery End, fittingly given he and his wife have just had a baby daughter. Warner drives a couple out into the deep, then gets two bonus overthrows from a nudge for a single, as Morgan\u2019s throw is wild to Buttler. A couple of sedate singles, seven from the over, and Australia continue to cruise. A round of applause for Porus Patwari, everyone. \u201cLong time lurker, first time poster here.\u201d See, we\u2019re not so scary. \u201cOn the subject of Morgan saying that it would take time to earn trust for the famed duo, I would like to insert the case of Mohammed Amir (as I like to do in any cricket conversation I can). My clear bias and love for him aside, I think he is a shining example of how one can turn the tide on even the most vocal of critics by good behavior, penchant for repentance and of course, searing pace when bowling. His redemption arc should be taught in schools. I think I might have digressed but yeah, you get the gist. I am sure Rob would agree.\u201d I would never dare speak for Rob, he would flay me with a horse-hair switch for my insolence. But yes: keep being good at cricket, and keep playing with a smile on your face. Of course, it probably makes a difference when you\u2019re a teenage player being led astray by an older crooked leader rather than being the... err... older crooked leader. 16th over: Australia 83-0 (Finch 47, Warner 31) Mark Wood and his imaginary horse are being tonked today. Amongst a few streaky moments, like when Finch almost lifts a ball to mid-off. But around that Finch pulls fine to the fence, and crashes another straight drive. He\u2019s having a wild World Cup, Finch. Drinks. 15th over: Australia 75-0 (Finch 39, Warner 31) That\u2019s Warner looking good. Only for a single, but first ball from Ben Stokes sees Warner up on the balls of his feet, opening the blade and punching effortlessly behind point, crisply timed. That\u2019s how he has scored so many of his Test runs the last few years, and it\u2019s a sign of his game in good order. Perhaps things are slowly starting to come together. It\u2019s this strange situation where he\u2019s made an absolute pile of runs despite not hitting the ball as convincingly as he has at his best. 14th over: Australia 71-0 (Finch 37, Warner 29) And Warner carries on doing what Warner does, not quite timing his own shots but piling up runs nonetheless. He hangs back and drags a pull shot from Wood over mid-on, where it hung in the air for a minute but dropped into the plentiful safe acres beyond Moeen Ali. Warner then flicks three to midwicket, before Finch plays his own cramped pull shot over midwicket. Wood bowls a wide, then finally pulls things back with a couple of dots, but the over costs a dozen. 13th over: Australia 59-0 (Finch 33, Warner 22) This has to be one of the best wicketless opening spells in a one-dayer. Woakes has Finch completely mistiming his drive, aiming through mid-off but dragging away through mid-on. Of course a few people still have to say \u201cShot!\u201d because the ball went relatively straight for four, but it was never controlled. Then Woakes bowls a hand grenade, a ball that takes off from a good length, flying up to chest height as it passes Finch, the soaring through to the keeper. It jagged off the seam too. Literally unplayable. But as Woakes pitches fuller looking for something similarly unexpected, Finch thrashes a straight drive that does connect well for four. 12th over: Australia 50-0 (Finch 25, Warner 22) Mark Wood will be the first bowling change, on for Archer. Pace for pace. And he delivers first up, nailing Finch on the hip in an unpadded region, which causes a fair bit of pain. It must bruise up badly there where it\u2019s basically skin and bone. Wood errs with the next ball though, and even the uncomfortable Finch can glance it for four. Then a leg bye, and Warner finishes the over by aiming a huge drive at a ghost ball \u2013 it was never there. Whoooooo. Ok, by popular demand you can all blast Farnsy one more time. 11th over: Australia 44-0 (Finch 21, Warner 22) Another Woakes over, another big miscue from Finch as his off-side drive fetches an on-side run. Woakes is swinging the ball into Warner, the left-hander, and denying him any space. Warner is happy to wait this spell out, it seems. 10th over: Australia 44-0 (Finch 20, Warner 22) Archer just errs in length this over, and Warner is exactly the opportunist to take full toll. First he steps across and flips a couple of runs behind square, with only a great sprint from Rashid around from fine leg and a tumbling save preventing a boundary. Then Warner nails his cut shot to a ball just fractionally short, and gets four through point. He\u2019s gone past Finch\u2019s score. 9th over: Australia 36-0 (Finch 19, Warner 15) Woakes! He\u2019s bowling a beautiful spell here. Cuts the ball savagely, twice in the over, once through each batsman. One run from the over, from a push off the hip. He\u2019s all over it today, England\u2019s opening bowler. Matt Dony emails in. \u201cAdvance Australia Fair? Surely John Farnham\u2019s anthemic You\u2019re The Voice is the most inspiring. I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m yet to see coverage of a major Australian event that doesn\u2019t have it playing in the background at some point. You guys sure love Farnham.\u201d We sure do. Apparently it\u2019s not even his song, it\u2019s a cover. But I don\u2019t know want to know about it. Whoah-oh, oh oh, oh oh-oh-oh... 8th over: Australia 35-0 (Finch 19, Warner 14) Archer is really going smoothly now. He\u2019s bowling with the slope at Lord\u2019s, from the Pavilion End, and decking the ball appreciably. Back of a length, pushing both batsmen back, not giving any room. The only scoring shot is Warner getting an airborne three through midwicket. The Airborne Three. They solve plane crimes, I guess? Serialisation rights available on request. Here, have a read about Ian Botham being Ian Botham. 7th over: Australia 32-0 (Finch 19, Warner 11) Finch survives the review and gets off strike. Warner plays a strange sort of shot, going deep in his crease to a half-volley and then lifting it almost off the toe of the bat, over mid-off for four. Trying to get going. Then England almost review again, as Woakes buzzsaws Warner in two with a ball carving past his inside edge and over the stumps. Woakes things it took an edge, but is dissuaded. Leg before shout... Woakes hits him in front of middle, but high and with some angle on the delivery. The umpire says no, England say let\u2019s check, and the review finds that it was at best clipping the leg bail. Umpire\u2019s call, England keep the review, Finch keeps his wicket. 6th over: Australia 26-0 (Finch 18, Warner 6) Jofra Archer to Finch, who drives and is dropped! The Aussie skipper has been put down by James Vince at backward point. Jason Roy would have caught that. You\u2019ve just dropped a potentially quite useful two points at the World Cup. Et cetera. No, it was a very tough one. High and to his right, Vince flew across into the frame slow-motion like a pelican coming in to land. Got good airtime. Got fingertips to it. Wasn\u2019t much of a chance to fluke that one. Call it a quarter chance. But Finch has played a gaggle of false shots thus far. 5th over: Australia 23-0 (Finch 15, Warner 6) Finch looks good when he hits them. Woakes gets too short and Finch nails the pull shot through midwicket. Then knocks a single to the leg side. Abhijato is quick off the email mark. \u201cEngland were supposed to be the best team in this World Cup, but their performances haven\u2019t shown that. Their last three matches are virtual must-wins against the three best teams of the tournament if they are to make it to the knockouts - an objective which the ECB has invested a lot in fulfilling (while also sacrificing their overall domestic structure\u2019s overall stability). The following three matches might just be the most important in their cricketing history...\u201d Hugely significant, I agree. But the importance only underlines the disconnect, where the ECB have invested to make their 50-over team the best in the world, while actively planning to destroy 50-over cricket at domestic level and make it into a second-rate apprenticeship competition. 4th over: Australia 13-0 (Finch 10, Warner 6) Archer hasn\u2019t taken long to settle. Bowls a peach to Finch, back of a length and seaming away with a sizzle off the pitch. Finch eventually gets another high edge through a vacant area behind point, then to close the over Warner gets a ball leg-side enough to pull it fine for four. 3rd over: Australia 13-0 (Finch 9, Warner 2) Chris Woakes gives Warner a working over around off stump, but Warner is resolute in defence. Watching carefully, not willing to try anything, not until the last ball of the over which Warner chops hard into the ground behind point. It looks ungainly, but it\u2019s safe, and it nets him two runs to get off the mark. 2nd over: Australia 11-0 (Finch 9, Warner 0) Jofra Archer to start from the Pavilion End. His first ball to Australia in what will hopefully be a long and beautiful friendship. It\u2019s a peace offering, floated up outside off stump and driven by Finch for four! Top shot, splitting the cover field along the ground. Jofra gets his length right after that, and Finch watchfully plays out the over. Punch and counter. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Finch 5, Warner 0) Chris Woakes will get this who on the road. Finch facing the first ball without incident, then edging the second over slip! Went for it hard, as he does, and got a thick airborne edge. Away for four. Then a couple of leg byes off the thigh pad, and a single to cover. Warner gets stranded by a ball that moves away appreciably, so much so that I don\u2019t think you could say that he played at it. Eventful start. Morning / evening / International Space Station orbit to you all. Which is the more inspiring song: Advance Australia Fair, or Stand By, by Rudimental? A titanic battle for the ages. It\u2019s humid and grey and not too warm here in London. A wet dog sort of day. What will that do to the ball? Let\u2019s find out. Speaking of Geoff, here he is to take over the OBO controls and guide you through the Australian innings. Cheerio from me. \u201cEven two-thirds of the way through the Cricket World Cup group stage we are still waiting for teams to peel off their false moustaches and reveal who they really are,\u201d writes Geoff Lemon in his match preview. For a team blessed with a rich history of facial hair, these Australians are actually relatively clean shaven for this tournament. Just Starc, Richardson and Warner can claim to have top lip slugs, and none stand alone \u2013 they\u2019re all part of a wider bearded look. Boon, Hughes and Mitchell Johnson in Movember these are not. Anyway, just a thought that entirely misses the point of Geoff\u2019s excellent article, which you can read here: But first we\u2019ll have the anthems. Advance Australia first. The players lock arms as a giant cricket ball covered in an Australian flag floats in the background. If that doesn\u2019t bring a tear to your eye, nothing will. And now God Save the Queen. Nearly ready to go. \u201cI was at Jimmy Anderson\u2019s book launch recently when he commented that Virat Kohli wasn\u2019t being nice in asking Indian fans not to boo,\u201d writes Evelyn Williames. \u201cHe realised that the booing just encouraged them (as it did Stuart Broad in Australia).\u201d We\u2019re about to find out, with Warner under 10 minutes away from walking out onto the hallowed Lord\u2019s turf, alongside his opening partner Aaron Finch. Today is a big test for England. And it\u2019s not going to get any easier in their remaining two matches. Let\u2019s not forget who lies in store for the hosts in their remaining two games after Australia: India and New Zealand. Defeat today could seriously damage their hopes of reaching the semis, especially with Bangladesh breathing down their necks \u2013 who are now just a point behind after victory in Southampton 24 hours ago. Just to confirm those line-ups: Morgan flips the coin, Finch calls wrongly and England will bowl first in the overcast conditions. In terms of teams, Morgan confirms England are unchanged after Archer passed a late fitness test. \u201cHe\u2019s good. He had a little stiffness in his side the last two games,\u201d Morgan says, before saying he\u2019s now good to go. Finch admits he wasn\u2019t sure whether to bat or bowl if he won the toss. Don\u2019t worry about that, Aaron. Two changes for Australia: in come Nathan Lyon, for his first match this tournament, and Jason Behrendorff with Adam Zampa and Nathan Coulter-Nile the men to give way. The captain doth protest too much. Here\u2019s the inimitable Vic Marks, on Morgan and the fact that is most certainly not a hum-drum, just-another-game for England. Eoin Morgan is entitled not to over-hype the occasion and to keep his players cool. But the protestation that this is just a routine World Cup match was not entirely convincing. In fact, if England had beaten Sri Lanka at Headingley his view of Tuesday\u2019s mouthwatering meeting with Australia would have more credence. It is true that England can lose at Lord\u2019s and still control their own destiny in this tournament as they strive to satisfy the bare minimum of expectations: reaching the semi-finals. But if Australia prevail then the nerves really start jangling, however icy-calm Morgan may like to appear. Then England might have to win both their remaining matches, against India and New Zealand, neither of whom have been beaten so far. More on the weather. The importance of the weather radar to everyone\u2019s enjoyment today cannot be underestimated. There\u2019s cloud cover hanging over Lord\u2019s, but importantly no rain and we\u2019re set to get underway with no delay. Team news. Confirmed XIs obviously won\u2019t be in until a bit later, but Jofra Archer has been suffering from a side problem and underwent a late fitness test at Lord\u2019s. He\u2019s passed it, according to OBOer Adam Collins. And Michael Vaughan has just said on the telly that Nathan Lyon may make an appearance for Australia. \u201cRegaining trust takes a lot of time\u201d. For anyone fearing the Lord\u2019s crowd may delight in getting on the backs of the two players at the centre of the aforementioned scandal, thank goodness then for England captain Eoin Morgan, who took the opportunity on the eve of the match to pour cold water on any hot heads wanting to have a pop at poor old Dave Warner and Steve Smith. No, not really, they\u2019re fair game apparently. Hello and welcome. Sydney calling first up to set the scene ahead of today\u2019s hugely-anticipated meeting at Lord\u2019s, before handing over to London for the start of play (10:30am local, 7:30pm AEST). It hardly needs hyping, such is the, um, special relationship between these two countries, but the fact that this gives England fans a chance to remind their antipodean cousins of the time Australian cricket imploded in Cape Town 15 months ago is sure to only add even more heat to an already five-chilli occasion. But it\u2019s not just about two very naughty boys seeking a kind of redemption and some inevitably cheap jokes emanating from the stands today. There\u2019s a Cricket World Cup on, and with just two points separating the sides heading into this fixture, there\u2019s table position to play for. Australia sit in second on 10 points, with England fourth on eight, both having played six games. An Australian win will see them leapfrog New Zealand into top spot and put a huge dent in England\u2019s hopes of reaching the semis; defeat will see England draw level on points. First place plays fourth and second plays third in the semis. Anyway, please do feel free to get in touch with any thoughts on today\u2019s match. I\u2019ll try to field any emails before handing over to Geoff for the first ball. It\u2019s mike.hytner@theguardian.com on email or @mike_hytner on Twitter. Go!",

      "body": "<p>You can see why Boris Johnson\u2019s carers have chosen to mothball him in recent weeks. His decline has been almost total. Johnson never did much care for the past or the future. Every day has always been a tabula rasa, one on which he was free to reinvent himself as he pleased without being bound by any commitments he may have made. Now though, he appears to barely have a present. Unable even to maintain the most basic rules of conversation, his words are just a scattergun of free association.</p> <p>Nick Ferrari began Johnson\u2019s LBC radio interview with a few easy rapid-fire yes and no questions as if to establish a benchmark for the lie detector. It proved hard work as Johnson was such a shambles he could barely even confirm his name. Was he a coward? That should have been a no brainer. That\u2019s the one thing on which everyone \u2013 even his friends \u2013 agree. Johnson merely looked confused. The silence was interpreted as a yes on the polygraph.</p> <p>Having made some kind of progress, Ferrari moved on to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/boris-johnson-team-photo-partner-carrie-symonds\">the staged photograph of Johnson and Carrie Symonds in a Sussex garden</a>. Did he know who had taken the picture? \u201cUm... er...,\u201d mumbled Boris. There had been so many photos and so little time. Could he even remember when the photo was taken? A look of panic crossed his face. When you\u2019ve told so many lies, there\u2019s always a danger you might accidentally tell the truth.</p> <p>Look, said Ferrari, the hair\u2019s all wrong in the photo. It\u2019s much longer than it is now. So this picture was taken months ago. You\u2019ve been taking the public for fools. \u201cUm... er... crikey,\u201d Johnson stammered, trying to rediscover the inner clown tribute act which had proved such a winner in the early years of his political career. The thing about his hair ...

      "bodyText": "You can see why Boris Johnson\u2019s carers have chosen to mothball him in recent weeks. His decline has been almost total. Johnson never did much care for the past or the future. Every day has always been a tabula rasa, one on which he was free to reinvent himself as he pleased without being bound by any commitments he may have made. Now though, he appears to barely have a present. Unable even to maintain the most basic rules of conversation, his words are just a scattergun of free association. Nick Ferrari began Johnson\u2019s LBC radio interview with a few easy rapid-fire yes and no questions as if to establish a benchmark for the lie detector. It proved hard work as Johnson was such a shambles he could barely even confirm his name. Was he a coward? That should have been a no brainer. That\u2019s the one thing on which everyone \u2013 even his friends \u2013 agree. Johnson merely looked confused. The silence was interpreted as a yes on the polygraph. Having made some kind of progress, Ferrari moved on to the staged photograph of Johnson and Carrie Symonds in a Sussex garden. Did he know who had taken the picture? \u201cUm... er...,\u201d mumbled Boris. There had been so many photos and so little time. Could he even remember when the photo was taken? A look of panic crossed his face. When you\u2019ve told so many lies, there\u2019s always a danger you might accidentally tell the truth. Look, said Ferrari, the hair\u2019s all wrong in the photo. It\u2019s much longer than it is now. So this picture was taken months ago. You\u2019ve been taking the public for fools. \u201cUm... er... crikey,\u201d Johnson stammered, trying to rediscover the inner clown tribute act which had proved such a winner in the early years of his political career. The thing about his hair ... The thing about him was he was so virile \u2013 literally overflowing with spunk at times \u2013 that his hair grew incredibly fast and he sometimes had to have it cut two or three times a day. There was no more coherence from Johnson when listeners were invited to have their say. Especially on Brexit. The man Tory MPs have staked their careers on is literally clueless about Brexit.

Trump has swung between dire threats and offers of talks without preconditions, while ramping up sanctions.</p> \n<p>The worsening confrontation became significantly more personal this week when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/24/mike-pompeo-us-saudi-arabia-talks-iran-united-arab-emirates-tensions\">the US imposed sanctions on </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/24/mike-pompeo-us-saudi-arabia-talks-iran-united-arab-emirates-tensions\"> Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei</a>, and eight military commanders, and threatened measures against the foreign minister, Javad Zarif.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Rouhani responded by describing the US president as \u201cafflicted by a mental disorder\u201d and said the sanctions against Khamenei were \u201coutrageous and idiotic\u201d \u2013 especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US.</p> \n<p>The insult was an echo of Kim Jong-un\u2019s broadside against the US president in September 2017, when he called Trump a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/22/a-rogue-and-a-gangster-kim-jong-uns-statement-on-trump-in-full\">mentally deranged US dotard</a>\u201d.

Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,\u201d he wrote.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe U.S. has not forgotten Iran\u2019s use of IED\u2019s &amp; EFP\u2019s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more \u2026 Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s estimate of US fatalities is much higher than the <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/04/04/iran-killed-more-us-troops-in-iraq-than-previously-known-pentagon-says/\">Pentagon estimate</a> of 600.</p> \n<p>Iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the US under the current oil, banking and trade embargo.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>The Trump administration has accompanied the buildup of economic pressure with offers to talk. In recent days, Trump has said that offer is without preconditions. However, there have been mixed messages over what any talks would be about. State department officials have insisted a wide-ranging list of 12 US demands, including withdrawal from Syria and cutting support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, would have to be met for sanctions to be lifted.</p> \n<p>Trump has repeatedly suggested that his sole concern is that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. Zarif on Tuesday restated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/25/iran-says-us-sanctions-on-supreme-leader-means-permanent-closure-of-diplomacy\">Iran\u2019s insistence that it would never pursue a nuclear weapon</a>, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so.</p> \n<p>Iran has previously said it is ideologically and religiously opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Trump could pick up Zarif\u2019s remarks as a signal to talk.</p> \n<p>Tehran has warned that on Thursday it will breach the limits on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. Without sanctions relief, it will take a further \u2013 potentially more significant \u2013 step on 8 July of raising the level at which it enriches uranium, above the 3.67% agreed in 2015.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"89bb1ff7-d3d5-4bfc-84c9-122caee3ab1f\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-full-text-of-joint-comprehensive-plan-of-action\">Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/14/iran-nuclear-deal-expected-to-be-announced-in-vienna\">ended a 12-year deadlock</a>&nbsp;over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete.

      "bodyText": "The Iranian and US presidents have traded insults, with Hassan Rouhani suggesting that Donald Trump suffered from a \u201cmental disorder\u201d and Trump once more threatening Iran with \u201cobliteration\u201d. The very personal exchange was reminiscent of similar verbal clashes between the US and North Korean leaders in late 2017, and underlined the volatility of US foreign policymaking in the present standoff in the Gulf. Trump has swung between dire threats and offers of talks without preconditions, while ramping up sanctions. The worsening confrontation became significantly more personal this week when the US imposed sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, and eight military commanders, and threatened measures against the foreign minister, Javad Zarif. On Tuesday, Rouhani responded by describing the US president as \u201cafflicted by a mental disorder\u201d and said the sanctions against Khamenei were \u201coutrageous and idiotic\u201d \u2013 especially as the 80-year-old cleric has no overseas assets and no plans to ever travel to the US. The insult was an echo of Kim Jong-un\u2019s broadside against the US president in September 2017, when he called Trump a \u201cmentally deranged US dotard\u201d. The slanging match between Trump and Kim ultimately gave way to summitry and claims of mutual affection (with Trump even claiming they \u201cfell in love\u201d). The path to a diplomatic breakthrough with Iran, however, looks far more complicated. As it has frequently in the past, the reference to Trump\u2019s mental faculties triggered an emotional response, and a flurry of tweets. \u201cIran leadership doesn\u2019t understand the words \u2018nice\u2019 or \u2018compassion,\u2019 they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe U.S. has not forgotten Iran\u2019s use of IED\u2019s &amp; EFP\u2019s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more \u2026 Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration.\u201d Trump\u2019s estimate of US fatalities is much higher than the Pentagon estimate of 600. Iran has been adamant it will not be pressured into concessions and will not negotiate with the US under the current oil, banking and trade embargo. The Trump administration has accompanied the buildup of economic pressure with offers to talk. In recent days, Trump has said that offer is without preconditions. However, there have been mixed messages over what any talks would be about. State department officials have insisted a wide-ranging list of 12 US demands, including withdrawal from Syria and cutting support to Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, would have to be met for sanctions to be lifted. Trump has repeatedly suggested that his sole concern is that Iran does not acquire a nuclear weapon. Zarif on Tuesday restated Iran\u2019s insistence that it would never pursue a nuclear weapon, saying Islam prevented the country from doing so. Iran has previously said it is ideologically and religiously opposed to acquiring nuclear weapons and seeks nuclear power only for civilian purposes. But in the current unpredictable climate it is possible Trump could pick up Zarif\u2019s remarks as a signal to talk. Tehran has warned that on Thursday it will breach the limits on its stockpile of low-enriched uranium set out in the 2015 nuclear deal. Without sanctions relief, it will take a further \u2013 potentially more significant \u2013 step on 8 July of raising the level at which it enriches uranium, above the 3.67% agreed in 2015. With those potential flashpoints looming, France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, spoke to Rouhani by telephone on Tuesday. Macron and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, are expected to try to defuse tensions when they see Trump at the G20 summit in Osaka on Friday. Tehran said the US had spent weeks demanding that Iran match America\u2019s diplomacy, but was now trying to immobilise its chief diplomat, by sanctioning Zarif. \u201cImposing useless sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader and the commander of Iran\u2019s diplomacy is the permanent closure of the path of diplomacy,\u201d the foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, said in a tweet on Tuesday. \u201cTrump\u2019s desperate administration is destroying the established international mechanisms for maintaining world peace and security.\u201d Speaking in Israel, Trump\u2019s national security adviser, John Bolton, insisted the president remained open to real negotiations and \u201call that Iran needs to do is walk through that open door\u201d. Iran\u2019s decision to breach the nuclear deal places the EU in a dilemma: France, Germany and the UK are desperate to keep the deal alive but cannot find a route to de-escalate the crisis between Tehran and Washington. The three European countries issued a statement on the margins of the UN security council on Monday urging Iran to stay inside the deal. They also insisted they were working hard to implement their commitments to Iran \u2013 a reference to setting up financial mechanisms to help Tehran trade with Europe without the threat of US sanctions \u2013 and condemned recent attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, warned Iran not to breach the uranium enrichment limits, saying in the Commons: \u201cIt is absolutely essential they stick to that deal in its entirety for it to preserve and for us to have a nuclear-free Middle East.\u201d He also ruled out British involvement in military action. \u201cThe US is our closest ally. We talk to them the whole time but I cannot envisage any situation where they request, or we agree to, any moves to go to war.\u201d Analysts said the impact of the fresh US sanctions on an already heavily sanctioned country would be limited. \u201cThe newly announced Iran sanctions are symbolic,\u201d said Jarrett Blanc, a former senior state department official now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. The ratcheting up of tensions between the two countries comes in the wake of the Gulf of Oman tanker attacks, when two vessels were damaged by explosions. The Trump administration blamed Iran for the attacks, but Tehran denied responsibility.",

Their backing vocals are essential to our sound, and their energy and spirits are colossal and are irreplaceable forces.\u201d Snow Patrol have cancelled tour dates up to and including the Latitude festival on 20 July, where they were due to headline. \u201cWe have hardly ever cancelled shows in 25 years together and we don\u2019t do it lightly,\u201d the band said. The Charlatans will replace Snow Patrol on Glastonbury\u2019s Other stage on 28 June. Scottish singer Lewis Capaldi will replace the group at TRNSMT festival in Glasgow on 14 July. Stereophonics will play in their stead at Latitude on 20 July. Snow Patrol released their seventh album, Wildness, in 2018. It was their first album to feature McDaid as a full-time member of the band and reached No 2 on the UK charts. The group achieved their commercial peak with their 2006 album Eyes Open, the 58th best-selling album of all time on the UK album charts.",

      "bodyText": "FirstGroup chair Wolfhart Hauser is to stand down after 30% of investors voted against his re-election, although the train and bus operator has survived an attempt by its biggest shareholder to oust the entire board. Shareholders voted by almost three to one to to reject 13 resolutions brought by activist investor Coast Capital seeking to remove the chief executive and five other directors, behind closed doors at an emergency general meeting in London on Tuesday. The result may give some breathing space to First, one of the UK\u2019s biggest bus and train operators, which is rumoured to be in line to be awarded the West Coast mainline rail franchise. However, New York Hedge Fund Coast, which owns a 10% stake in First and was backed by the other biggest shareholder, Columbia Threadneedle, has vowed to keep up its fight to replace the board. Describing the resignation of Hauser as a \u201cconstructive first step\u201d in achieving value for shareholders, Coast said it \u201cbelieves that FirstGroup needs and deserves a board which is populated with directors who have the relevant experience and who act to the benefit of all shareholders. We will continue to pursue this goal vigorously.\u201d First said shareholders had \u201cvoted decisively against Coast Capital\u2019s attempt to take control\u201d, but it said the board had noted that more than 20% voted in favour of several resolutions, against its recommendation. It pledged to \u201ccontinue to engage with our investors over the coming weeks to discuss any views they may have\u201d. Hauser said after the vote that he would not be standing for re-election at the annual meeting on 25 July, leaving David Robbie as interim chairman to launch the hunt for his replacement. Hauser said he was \u201cconfident [in] the clear path forward laid out\u201d last month by First chief executive Matthew Gregory, whose ejection was supported by 25% of shareholders at the EGM. Gregory\u2019s strategy announcement, including the sell-off of US coach business Greyhound and the separation of the UK bus division, was described by Coast as too little too late. The backing of shareholders comes as First stands on the brink of finally winning the the West Coast partnership franchise, for rights to operate intercity trains on the London-Glasgow line and see in the first HS2 highspeed services after 2026. First, which missed out to Virgin in 2012 in the franchising fiasco, is believed to have edged the decision against the Chinese competitor on the shortlist of two, but the Department for Transport has not confirmed the award during the investor revolt. A fresh contract would attract further shareholder scrutiny, after First made writedowns of more than \u00a3100m on both its TransPennine and South Western franchises.",

If you see me on a train with my dog, you can assume that something has gone badly wrong with my travel plans. I know my dog is adorable, but I am only prepared to talk about that for a limited amount of the journey. Getting an adorable pet was not my idea. Because my dog is also small and needy, it will probably insist on spending some time standing on my lap. This is not the same as a dog on a seat, and again, it will not have been my idea. I go on trains to take a break from my dog.</p> <h2><strong>What about children?</strong></h2> <p>I have travelled with small children, and in my experience most passengers would rather sit next to a dog than a toddler. On a crowded train, you should give up your seat for a toddler if you have for some reason come to dislike the person you are sitting next to. Older people should be offered your seat, depending on how old they seem, and not how old they are. Do not ask for ID.</p> <h2><strong>Is it ever acceptable to put a bag on the seat?</strong></h2> <p>No. A bag on a seat is worse than a dog on a seat. At least the dog is enjoying the ride. Even worse than bags is feet on seats. Any attempt to cushion yourself from the possibility of having to sit next to someone is both antisocial and prone to backfire \u2013 you end up sitting next to someone who hates you and they will give up their seat to the first toddler to come along.</p> <h2><strong>Should you chat to your neighbours?</strong></h2> <p>It is almost never acceptable to make eye contact with a stranger on a train, even if you are facing them across a table for a five-hour journey. I am very sorry my dog does not understand this.</p>",

We must scrap them now</a>, Journal, 21 June). While most people now have a car, about 20% of families don\u2019t, and the poorest quartile households use taxis most. To get people to use cars less needs an acceptable alternative. Most journeys are short: 50% under 3 miles and 70% under 5 miles. For those able to, walking and cycling are as fast, or faster if parking is considered, but people are walking less and hardly cycling because our urban roads are seen to be dangerous.</p> <p>There are places that have halved urban car trips from 70% as in the UK, and upped cycling from 3% to 25%. Such places have maintained their electric trams, which are used for 30% of trips. The rest are walked. Such places have much less traffic, virtually no congestion, low pollution and fitter populations. While fuel duty is a significant revenue for the government more sustainable or active means of travel will have only symbolic investment and the NHS will continue to spend about a fifth of its budget treating traffic pollution-related illnesses.</p> <p>Incidentally, EM Forster envisaged a car-less future in The Machine Stops.

As this example from Germany shows, \u201cyou are the bus stop\u201d seems to result in an increase in passenger numbers.</p> <p>If the home of the European car industry can come up with such innovation, maybe some imagination is needed to do more with what we have.<br><strong>Roland Pascoe</strong><br><em>Chair, The Resilience Foundation</em></p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019m delighted John Crace (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/21/ipad-confusion-tory-antics-indicate-lack-intelligent-life-on-earth\" title=\"\">Digested week</a>, 22 June) may be about to join the <a href=\"https://tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/technical-note-12-how-many-cars-are-there-in-london.pdf\" title=\"\">46%</a> of London households who don\u2019t own a car.

      "bodyText": "George Monbiot stirred up a hornet\u2019s nest with his article about the end of the car (Cars choke the life out of our cities. We must scrap them now, Journal, 21 June). While most people now have a car, about 20% of families don\u2019t, and the poorest quartile households use taxis most. To get people to use cars less needs an acceptable alternative. Most journeys are short: 50% under 3 miles and 70% under 5 miles. For those able to, walking and cycling are as fast, or faster if parking is considered, but people are walking less and hardly cycling because our urban roads are seen to be dangerous. There are places that have halved urban car trips from 70% as in the UK, and upped cycling from 3% to 25%. Such places have maintained their electric trams, which are used for 30% of trips. The rest are walked. Such places have much less traffic, virtually no congestion, low pollution and fitter populations. While fuel duty is a significant revenue for the government more sustainable or active means of travel will have only symbolic investment and the NHS will continue to spend about a fifth of its budget treating traffic pollution-related illnesses. Incidentally, EM Forster envisaged a car-less future in The Machine Stops. Is this what George Monbiot seeks? Professor LJS Lesley President, Merseyside Cycling Campaign, Liverpool \u2022 Further to the correspondence on moving away from car use (Letters, 24 June), perhaps a tiny step forward may be made by developing local dial-and-ride bus services such as those recently reported by Max Planck Research. The crucial developments in this example seem to be that the routes are determined by where people wish to go to, and it is integrated into transport networks. As this example from Germany shows, \u201cyou are the bus stop\u201d seems to result in an increase in passenger numbers. If the home of the European car industry can come up with such innovation, maybe some imagination is needed to do more with what we have. Roland Pascoe Chair, The Resilience Foundation \u2022 I\u2019m delighted John Crace (Digested week, 22 June) may be about to join the 46% of London households who don\u2019t own a car. He\u2019ll soon find that you don\u2019t need one in London, especially if you have a bicycle, a car club membership or a Freedom Pass.

We estimate that the debt of the tampon tax is well over \u00a3700m and we are building a campaign to get at least \u00a3500m of this ringfenced for women\u2019s specialist charities, and hold the government to account on its promise.

      "bodyText": "We were pleased to see coverage of the ingenuity of some German women to highlight the ongoing issue of taxing period products, which are a necessity, not a luxury for women and girls (Report, 22 June). Here in the UK, books and tampons are also joining forces. Ranjit Kaur, author of the recently published The Dancing Maharani and Other Stories, is supporting our tampon tax campaign by donating a share of the profits from the book to the campaign. As your article rightly notes, we at WRC have expressed our dismay that the then chancellor\u2019s promise \u2013 to fund women\u2019s health and support charities with monies raised from this tax \u2013 has been broken. We estimate that the debt of the tampon tax is well over \u00a3700m and we are building a campaign to get at least \u00a3500m of this ringfenced for women\u2019s specialist charities, and hold the government to account on its promise. In its media campaign, the Inland Revenue claims that \u201ctax shouldn\u2019t be taxing\u201d. Equally, tampons shouldn\u2019t be taxed. However, they are and that money should go to women\u2019s charities. Period.

A price of about \u00a3350,000 was agreed for the export, due to take place the following month.</p> <p>At the same time, Biffa agreed with a second broker to ship 4,992 tonnes of mixed paper in a contract worth almost \u00a3290,000.</p> <p>The Environment Agency prevented any of the seven containers from leaving Felixstowe.</p> <p>Since the China ban, exporters have turned to other foreign markets for British waste, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Turkey. But Vietnam and Malaysia have also imposed restrictions on imports in response to the vastly increased amounts arriving on their shores.</p> <p>Biffa pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of breaching regulation 23 of the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. It is an offence under the regulations to breach article 36 of the European waste shipments regulations 1013/2006, which bans the export of waste collected from households to China.</p> <p>Judge Simon Auerbach deferred sentencing until 27 September.</p> <p>A Biffa spokesperson said: \u201cThis case highlights the need for the Environment Agency to issue clear guidance to the industry as to what are the acceptable levels of purity for UK-exported mixed paper. In this instance, the jury was asked to make a judgment as to whether they considered the level of contamination was minimal, without any quantitative guidance.</p> <p>\u201cIn the absence of any EA guidelines, our products always met the standards set by our customers and provided a route to recycling in an environmentally sound manner.\u201d </p>",

The first broker took up a request from a Chinese client in April 2015 to arrange shipment of 5,863 tonnes of mixed waste paper by contacting Biffa. A price of about \u00a3350,000 was agreed for the export, due to take place the following month. At the same time, Biffa agreed with a second broker to ship 4,992 tonnes of mixed paper in a contract worth almost \u00a3290,000. The Environment Agency prevented any of the seven containers from leaving Felixstowe. Since the China ban, exporters have turned to other foreign markets for British waste, including Vietnam, Malaysia and Turkey. But Vietnam and Malaysia have also imposed restrictions on imports in response to the vastly increased amounts arriving on their shores. Biffa pleaded not guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of breaching regulation 23 of the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 2007. It is an offence under the regulations to breach article 36 of the European waste shipments regulations 1013/2006, which bans the export of waste collected from households to China. Judge Simon Auerbach deferred sentencing until 27 September. A Biffa spokesperson said: \u201cThis case highlights the need for the Environment Agency to issue clear guidance to the industry as to what are the acceptable levels of purity for UK-exported mixed paper. In this instance, the jury was asked to make a judgment as to whether they considered the level of contamination was minimal, without any quantitative guidance. \u201cIn the absence of any EA guidelines, our products always met the standards set by our customers and provided a route to recycling in an environmentally sound manner.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>The gender pay gap is everywhere, but nowhere more so than in construction. According to analysis by XpertHR, construction firms\u2019 data revealed <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/genderpaygapintheuk/2018\" title=\"\">a pay gap of 24% \u2013 compared with a national average of 8.6%</a>.</p> <p>Alison Fitch, HR manager at Invennt, a management consultancy that deals exclusively with construction, says there are a number of factors limiting the industry\u2019s ability to attract and retain female talent, including gender imbalance and a lack of flexible working arrangements that make it difficult for women to stay in work while caring for children. Michelle Gyimah, gender pay gap consultant at Equality Pays, agrees, saying civil engineering faces a double challenge: to attract women, and to retain them and enable their progress.</p> <p>It\u2019s something associate structural and civil engineer Victoria Martin has experienced. While engineering consultancy is, for the most part, meritocratic, there are still too few women occupying technical and design roles that offer scope for progression, she says. \u201cThis skew towards the typically lower paid administration roles is then undoubtedly reflected in the gender pay gap figures.\u201d A 2017 report from the Association of Women in Property presented research carried out with pay gap analysis provider Gapsquare and executive research consultants, Rosemont Partnership, which surveyed representatives from all sections of the construction market. The research revealed that 30% of women left their jobs after two years or less, and only 12% of women were in a managerial role.</p> <p>From stereotypes and bias to a lack of flexibility, the reasons behind the gender pay gap in civil engineering seem clear. But what steps should the industry take to change that? For Gyimah, the sector needs to address \u201cbias in the workplace and confrontational behaviours, offering more equal gender hiring on apprenticeships and graduate schemes right through to better maternity packages, introducing shared parental leave and embedding flexible working arrangements\u201d.</p> <p>Writing in a blog post, Rachel Bell, chairman of the south-west branch of the Association of Women in Property, says: \u201cAt a time when flexible work environments and breakout spaces at universities are common, young people expect the same flexibility at work, too.\u201d</p> <p>Change will take time, says Gyimah. \u201cThe key is to focus on long-term sustainable change. The gender pay gap has not appeared overnight, so it will take time to see sustainable change. Recent Equality and Human Rights Commission research shows that six in 10 women now use gender pay gap data as a deciding factor when it comes to job seeking. So if civil engineering firms are serious about addressing pay gaps, then ensuring that they have robust action plans in place is important.\u201d</p> <p>Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at trade union Prospect, says there are initiatives aimed at narrowing the gender pay gap, but they are not making enough difference quickly enough. \u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of confusion about what a gender pay gap is compared with what equal pay means.

      "bodyText": "The gender pay gap is everywhere, but nowhere more so than in construction. According to analysis by XpertHR, construction firms\u2019 data revealed a pay gap of 24% \u2013 compared with a national average of 8.6%. Alison Fitch, HR manager at Invennt, a management consultancy that deals exclusively with construction, says there are a number of factors limiting the industry\u2019s ability to attract and retain female talent, including gender imbalance and a lack of flexible working arrangements that make it difficult for women to stay in work while caring for children. Michelle Gyimah, gender pay gap consultant at Equality Pays, agrees, saying civil engineering faces a double challenge: to attract women, and to retain them and enable their progress. It\u2019s something associate structural and civil engineer Victoria Martin has experienced. While engineering consultancy is, for the most part, meritocratic, there are still too few women occupying technical and design roles that offer scope for progression, she says. \u201cThis skew towards the typically lower paid administration roles is then undoubtedly reflected in the gender pay gap figures.\u201d A 2017 report from the Association of Women in Property presented research carried out with pay gap analysis provider Gapsquare and executive research consultants, Rosemont Partnership, which surveyed representatives from all sections of the construction market. The research revealed that 30% of women left their jobs after two years or less, and only 12% of women were in a managerial role. From stereotypes and bias to a lack of flexibility, the reasons behind the gender pay gap in civil engineering seem clear. But what steps should the industry take to change that? For Gyimah, the sector needs to address \u201cbias in the workplace and confrontational behaviours, offering more equal gender hiring on apprenticeships and graduate schemes right through to better maternity packages, introducing shared parental leave and embedding flexible working arrangements\u201d. Writing in a blog post, Rachel Bell, chairman of the south-west branch of the Association of Women in Property, says: \u201cAt a time when flexible work environments and breakout spaces at universities are common, young people expect the same flexibility at work, too.\u201d Change will take time, says Gyimah. \u201cThe key is to focus on long-term sustainable change. The gender pay gap has not appeared overnight, so it will take time to see sustainable change. Recent Equality and Human Rights Commission research shows that six in 10 women now use gender pay gap data as a deciding factor when it comes to job seeking. So if civil engineering firms are serious about addressing pay gaps, then ensuring that they have robust action plans in place is important.\u201d Sue Ferns, senior deputy general secretary at trade union Prospect, says there are initiatives aimed at narrowing the gender pay gap, but they are not making enough difference quickly enough. \u201cThere\u2019s still quite a lot of confusion about what a gender pay gap is compared with what equal pay means. We need to educate people.\u201d In Ferns\u2019 view, effective dialogue is best achieved through union representation. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for individuals to pursue this on their own. We all know about the leaky pipeline. It requires a change in culture that is visible through practical changes in the workplace. There is no easy solution, but there is a strong case for focusing on the issues that concern women most.\u201d Experience: \u2018There were no industry mentoring sessions\u2019 When architect Carol Stitchman was growing up, her career options seemed limited.

      "body": "<p>Encouraging women to join traditionally male-dominated sectors isn\u2019t easy. But do women face even more hurdles when it comes to civil engineering and construction?</p> <p>\u201cFrom holding your own as the only woman in a room full of older men, to defying stereotypes and practicalities such as never having personal protective equipment (PPE) that fits, there are many hurdles faced by women in our industry,\u201d says Kate Watson, associate director, structural engineering at Patrick Parsons. Those hurdles start early, says associate structural and civil engineer Victoria Martin, with physics and maths often dominated by boys, and parents being less in favour of daughters studying engineering than sons. \u201cI can\u2019t help but notice that a large proportion of the female engineers I know (myself included) have been educated in a single-sex environment, free of the daily reminders that they are something of an anomaly,\u201d says Martin.</p> <p>For those who do make it into engineering, achieving a professional status carries a lot of weight, she adds. \u201cWomen who want to combine a family with a rewarding career, if they haven\u2019t achieved professional status prior to taking a break then this timeline can be further delayed. It meant a lot to me to get chartered and then promoted to associate before I had my first child, as I would then be returning with a level of credibility under my belt.\u201d</p> <p>A lack of parity when it comes to parental pay is another hurdle. \u201cFor a lot of families, the pattern of the woman as the main caregiver is established. This often comes at odds with the demands of the construction industry; operating at a high level is hard to balance with part-time or compressed hours.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible, though, she says, adding that if both women and men were asking for flexible working hours there might be more of a cultural shift in attitudes.</p> <p>For project engineer Daisy Partlow, the biggest problem is perception. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to do with us,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are subconscious stereotypes \u2013 in the office, nine times out of 10 if someone is trying to find someone they\u2019ll walk past 10 other people and then come and ask me. That kind of thing puts people off.\u201d</p> <p>The sector recognises it has a lot of work to do \u2013 and has already started. Elizabeth Donnelly, CEO of the Women\u2019s Engineering Society (WES), says their efforts include <a href=\"https://mentorset.chronus.com/about\">MentorSET</a>, a mentoring programme to support women engineers throughout their careers, as well as support for Stem Returners to help them return to engineering after a career break. It also founded <a href=\"http://www.inwed.org.uk/\">International Women in Engineering Day (INWED)</a>, an annual global celebration of women engineers.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://instituteofcoding.org/\">Institute of Coding</a> (IoC) has created new flexible qualifications \u2013 designed to help women reskill \u2013 through its digital degree apprenticeship scheme. \u201cAll too often, stereotypes around courses, a notable gender pay gap and rigid working models mean that not enough female talent reaches the top, leading to a worrying lack of diversity,\u201d says director Rachid Hourizi.</p> <p>Elsewhere, training providers are teaming up with industry to encourage women into the sector. In the East Midlands, Access Training and Derby-based building firm Hodgkinson Builders recently expanded the Access Training Construction Academy to boost construction apprenticeships. Ian Hodgkinson, managing director at Hodgkinson Builders, says: \u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.accesstraininguk.co.uk/\">Access Training Construction Academy</a> will work to encourage all sorts of people to come in to the trade \u2013 not just men \u2013 to get the word out that the building industry is a great place to be, and to dispel the old thinking and perceptions that can unfortunately still be around.\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to encouraging women into the sector, Watson says: \u201cI believe the best thing I can do on a personal level is to do my job as well as I can, and be seen to be doing so. I believe it is my responsibility to call out inequalities I see and encourage and support other women in the workforce. I hope that in the future we will see a further shift for women in our industry, but it\u2019s certainly not a time to sit back \u2013 although we\u2019ve come far in recent years, there is still a lot to be done and it\u2019s a long game.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Download our <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/06/21/Women_in_engineering_full_smaller.pdf\">women in engineering</a> supplement (pdf)</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "Encouraging women to join traditionally male-dominated sectors isn\u2019t easy. But do women face even more hurdles when it comes to civil engineering and construction? \u201cFrom holding your own as the only woman in a room full of older men, to defying stereotypes and practicalities such as never having personal protective equipment (PPE) that fits, there are many hurdles faced by women in our industry,\u201d says Kate Watson, associate director, structural engineering at Patrick Parsons. Those hurdles start early, says associate structural and civil engineer Victoria Martin, with physics and maths often dominated by boys, and parents being less in favour of daughters studying engineering than sons. \u201cI can\u2019t help but notice that a large proportion of the female engineers I know (myself included) have been educated in a single-sex environment, free of the daily reminders that they are something of an anomaly,\u201d says Martin. For those who do make it into engineering, achieving a professional status carries a lot of weight, she adds. \u201cWomen who want to combine a family with a rewarding career, if they haven\u2019t achieved professional status prior to taking a break then this timeline can be further delayed. It meant a lot to me to get chartered and then promoted to associate before I had my first child, as I would then be returning with a level of credibility under my belt.\u201d A lack of parity when it comes to parental pay is another hurdle. \u201cFor a lot of families, the pattern of the woman as the main caregiver is established. This often comes at odds with the demands of the construction industry; operating at a high level is hard to balance with part-time or compressed hours.\u201d It\u2019s not impossible, though, she says, adding that if both women and men were asking for flexible working hours there might be more of a cultural shift in attitudes. For project engineer Daisy Partlow, the biggest problem is perception. \u201cPeople just don\u2019t know what to do with us,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are subconscious stereotypes \u2013 in the office, nine times out of 10 if someone is trying to find someone they\u2019ll walk past 10 other people and then come and ask me. That kind of thing puts people off.\u201d The sector recognises it has a lot of work to do \u2013 and has already started. Elizabeth Donnelly, CEO of the Women\u2019s Engineering Society (WES), says their efforts include MentorSET, a mentoring programme to support women engineers throughout their careers, as well as support for Stem Returners to help them return to engineering after a career break. It also founded International Women in Engineering Day (INWED), an annual global celebration of women engineers. The Institute of Coding (IoC) has created new flexible qualifications \u2013 designed to help women reskill \u2013 through its digital degree apprenticeship scheme. \u201cAll too often, stereotypes around courses, a notable gender pay gap and rigid working models mean that not enough female talent reaches the top, leading to a worrying lack of diversity,\u201d says director Rachid Hourizi. Elsewhere, training providers are teaming up with industry to encourage women into the sector. In the East Midlands, Access Training and Derby-based building firm Hodgkinson Builders recently expanded the Access Training Construction Academy to boost construction apprenticeships. Ian Hodgkinson, managing director at Hodgkinson Builders, says: \u201cThe Access Training Construction Academy will work to encourage all sorts of people to come in to the trade \u2013 not just men \u2013 to get the word out that the building industry is a great place to be, and to dispel the old thinking and perceptions that can unfortunately still be around.\u201d When it comes to encouraging women into the sector, Watson says: \u201cI believe the best thing I can do on a personal level is to do my job as well as I can, and be seen to be doing so. I believe it is my responsibility to call out inequalities I see and encourage and support other women in the workforce. I hope that in the future we will see a further shift for women in our industry, but it\u2019s certainly not a time to sit back \u2013 although we\u2019ve come far in recent years, there is still a lot to be done and it\u2019s a long game.\u201d Download our women in engineering supplement (pdf)",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s winless and error-prone Under-21s boarded a private plane for home on Tuesday while Romania, Germany, France and Spain prepared for European championship semi-finals. Players dispersed on arrival in Birmingham but Aidy Boothroyd could not escape so easily. The inquest into what went wrong throughout England\u2019s 12 days in Italy and San Marino is about to intensify. The England head coach and his back\u2011room staff will convene at St George\u2019s Park on Friday for a debrief into a tournament approached with high hopes but ruined with two defeats in four days. Should their diaries allow, Boothroyd will also hold talks with Gareth Southgate to hear the senior manager\u2019s opinions on the development \u2013 or lack of it \u2013 of the next generation of English talent. As Boothroyd admitted after Monday\u2019s 3-3 draw against Croatia provided a suitably careless end to the campaign from an England team that led three times: \u201cThere is plenty to talk about.\u201d Southgate and his assistant, Steve Holland, were in Cesena to watch England fall to defeat against France and Romania. Les Reed, Dan Ashworth\u2019s replacement as technical director at the Football Association, witnessed all three group matches and confirmation of England\u2019s inability to iron out defensive flaws and extraordinary lapses in concentration. Nine goals were conceded by a team who let in only four in 10 unbeaten qualifiers. Seven of those arrived in the 75th minute or later as the team lost their shape in the closing stages of every game. There may be some sympathy for Boothroyd at the debriefs given the volume of damaging individual mistakes beyond the coach\u2019s control; or the protracted pursuit of Aaron Wan-Bissaka by Manchester United that turned the \u00a350m-rated defender\u2019s head at a bad time. But it would wrong of Southgate, Reed and others at the FA to absolve the Under-21s head coach of blame for a dispiriting campaign. England\u2019s hierarchy value the steady progression of young players into the senior ranks, the most important task of the Under-21s head coach.

      "bodyText": "MPs have condemned the Jeremy Kyle Show as a forum for tearing people apart in a \u201cRoman Colosseum-type way\u201d, as ITV executives tried to defend the treatment of participants in reality shows including Love Island. The executive producer of the now-axed Jeremy Kyle Show said its host \u201cstrongly believed\u201d in the results of lie detector tests that were a staple of the programme, while admitting that people who failed tests could have been telling the truth. Tom McLennan told the Commons culture select committee\u2019s inquiry into the treatment of reality show participants that he did not know how reliable the results of the tests were, and he said guests were told they were \u201cnot 100% accurate\u201d. Graham Stanier, director of aftercare for guests on the show, said: \u201cSome will fail the test but be telling the truth. They do become distressed because they disagree with the result.\u201d Damian Collins, the chair of the committee, said: \u201c[The results] are presented as fact. If you can\u2019t say what the range of the accuracy of the tests is, that is irresponsible.\u201d Last month ITV cancelled the programme after 14 years following the death of a guest, Steve Dymond.

      "bodyText": "How many close friends is too many? In Britain, it seems to be a question of why we don\u2019t have more. A global study of 10,000 people by Snapchat has found that Britons have fewer \u201cbest friends\u201d \u2013 2.6 on average \u2013 than those in other countries. In Saudi Arabia, participants reported 6.6 best friends on average. But do we really need any more? According to the MIT Technology Review, humans can cope with a maximum of five friends in their closest friendship circle. Meanwhile, Robin Dunbar, a psychologist at the University of Oxford, found in a 2016 study of 27,000 European phone-call logs that, on average, each person studied had 4.1 intimate relationships. So, how does the amount of close friends we have affect our lives? We took to the streets to find out. Alvin Jones, 70 Best friends: one \u201cA best friend is someone who will always tell you the truth, no matter how bad it is. My best friend, Doug, is someone whom I\u2019ve grown up with: we lived in flats opposite each other when we were five years old. He\u2019s now the godfather to my two children and is the brother I\u2019ve never had. Sadly, we\u2019re in a bit of a rough patch at the moment, because of our opposing views on Brexit, but I hope we can patch things up.\u201d Caroline Hamlett, 32 Best friends: five \u201cI lived with three of my best friends at university, but now they don\u2019t get along with each other, so I have individual relationships with them. When I get married in a few months, I\u2019ll be having only one bridesmaid, my sister, but I still want everyone there.\u201d Ted Allott, 30 Best friends: three \u201cSometimes it feels as if the only way I stay in touch with my best mates is through tagging them in social media posts. As you get older, your relationships dwindle, especially since we are all so focused on work.\u201d Rich Smith, 60 Best friends: four \u201cI\u2019ve lived all over the world, from being born and raised in England to moving to Australia and now raising my family in Taiwan, so my friends reflect that. All four of us go on holiday at least once a year without our wives and they\u2019re the people I trust most.\u201d MJ, 25 Best friends: four \u201cAll of my best friends serve different purposes in my life: some are childhood mates whom I can talk to at any time, others are friends I have a good time with and have met more recently \u2013 you need different people to rely on.

The chart below shows that there is a strong correlation which means that the gold price rises as the size of the negative yield debt increases. </p> <p>This makes perfect sense, of course, no one likes to have negative yield debt.

      "bodyText": "And finally.... Britain\u2019s stock market has ended the day where it began, with the FTSE 100 up just 5 points. European stock markets posted losses, with Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB shedding 0.75% and Spain losing 1%. Gold is still up today, at $1,427 per ounce - near the six-year high of $1,438 struck this morning. David Madden of CMC Markets sums up the day: It was been a lacklustre session in Europe today as the US-Iran, and the US-China tensions continue to circulate. The G20 summit is at the forefront of traders\u2019 minds and the meeting between Donald Trump and Xi Jinping is likely to determine the next major move in equities. Some traders are sitting on their hands until the meeting between the two leaders is out of the way. Goodnight! GW Americans are less upbeat about the economy -- something which may alarm the White House ahead of next year\u2019s elections. Bloomberg has the details: U.S. consumer confidence fell in June to the lowest level since September 2017 as Americans became less upbeat about the economy and labor market amid trade tensions with China and Mexico. The Conference Board\u2019s index declined to 121.5, lower than all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, data from the New York-based group showed Tuesday. A gauge of the present situation decreased to a one-year low of 162.6, while the measure of expectations fell to 94.1. President Trump has just hit back against Iran\u2019s claim that his new sanctions are \u201cmentally retarded\u201d. Trump is threatening to \u2018obliterate\u2019 parts of the country if Iranian forces attack America, which may make investors more anxious about geopolitical tensions. Despite today\u2019s losses, Wall Street is still on track for its best June since 1938. President Trump has awarded himself a pat on the back: He should really be thanking Mr Jerome Powell, though - the Fed chair sparked the rally by hinting that interest rates will be cut next month. Hello again. Wall Street has opened in the red, as geopolitical tensions worry investors. The Dow Jones industrial average has shed 108 points, or 0.4%, to 26,628 points. The broader S&amp;P 500, which hit a record high last week, has also dipped, by around 0.25%. Traders are cautious ahead of the G20 world leaders meeting this week, anxious that Donald Trump and Xi Jinping may not secure a trade war ceasefire. Analysts at USB had added to the jitters, forecasting a 20% stock market plunge if talks break down.... Speaking of cars..... the UK auto industry has sounded another warning against a no-deal Brexit. The SMMT has repeated its claim that car prices will go up by an average of \u00a31,500 if Britain left the EU without a withdrawal agreement. It also fears that a hard border would push up costs by up to \u00a350,000 every minute! That\u2019s because the delicate just-in-time production systems, and complicated cross-border supply chains, would become gummed up. Here\u2019s the full story: Britons also cut back on new car purchases this month. That suggests people are being cautious about making big-ticket spending decisions. The CBI says: 10% of motor traders reported sales volumes were up on a year ago, whilst 51% said they were down, giving a balance of -41%. Volumes are expected to be broadly flat next month (-3%). The FT blames Britain\u2019s poor summer for the decline in shopping. UK retail sales were hit by unseasonably cold weather in May and the trend seems to have continued in June, according to a closely watched survey. The CBI survey registered a retail sales balance of minus 42 per cent, after 16 per cent of the retailers surveyed said sales volumes were up on a year below in June, while 58 per cent said they were down. The balance was the lowest since the financial crisis and worse than markets expected. Here\u2019s Reuters\u2019 take on the decline in UK retail sales this month: British retail sales plunged this month at the fastest annual pace in 10 years, in part reflecting a surge in sales in June last year which were spurred by hot weather and the men\u2019s soccer World Cup, a survey showed on Tuesday. The Confederation of British Industry\u2019s monthly retail sales balance fell to -42 from -27 in May, below all forecasts in a Reuters poll that had pointed to an improved reading of -10. \u201cThis month\u2019s drop in sales should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the backdrop of last June\u2019s heatwave and the start of the World Cup,\u201d CBI economist Alpesh Paleja said. \u201cBut even accounting for both factors, underlying conditions on the High Street remain challenging.\u201d The CBI found that grocers were the largest contributors to the fall in sales volumes. That backs up the idea that Britons spent more on food and drink a year ago, as they picnicked in the sun or held World Cup parties. Hardware &amp; DIY stores also posted declines -- perhaps it was just too wet to buy a new barbeque or ourdoor decking. Andy Bruce of Reuters isn\u2019t convinced that this month\u2019s slump in retail sales can be disregarded, just because June 2018 was so rosy. Economics professor Danny Blanchflower reckons Brexit uncertainty is hurting the high street: That column will be online shortly.... Worryingly, many UK retailers are pessimistic about their prospects in July, and are cutting back on orders. Here are the key points from the CBI\u2019s gloomy assessment of UK retailing: 16% of retailers said that sales volumes were up in June on a year ago, whilst 58% said they were down, giving a weighted balance of -42%. 16% of respondents expect sales volumes to increase next month, whilst 27% expect a decrease, giving a balance of -11% 15% of retailers placed more orders with suppliers than they did a year ago, whilst 48% placed fewer orders, giving a balance of -33%. 26% of retailers reported that their volume of sales for the time of year were good, whilst 45% said they were poor, giving a balance of -19% Internet sales were broadly flat on a year ago (+3%), following growth in the previous month (+38%). Internet sales growth is expected to pick up in the year to July (+23%), but remain weaker than the long-run average (+46%) Economists are disappointed by the slump in retail sales this month: British retail sales plunged this month at the fastest annual pace in 10 years, as wet weather hurt the high street. The CBI\u2019s monthly retail sales balance (which asks firms if sales were up, or down compared to a year ago) has plunged to -42 from -27 in May, dashing hopes of a rise to -10. That sounds pretty alarming. However, the CBI points out that June 2018 was particularly warm - encouraging people to a) buy summer clothes and furniture, and b) splash out on food and drink as they enjoyd the Men\u2019s football world cup. CBI chief economist Alpesh Paleja says we shouldn\u2019t panic: This month\u2019s drop in sales should be taken with a pinch of salt, given the backdrop of last June\u2019s heatwave and the start of the World Cup. But even accounting for both factors, underlying conditions on the High Street remain challenging. Retailers are having to continually compete for the attention of value-conscious shoppers, in the age of digital disruption. \u201cThe new Prime Minister must help support retailers by reducing the high cumulative burden of costs they face. This should start by urgently reviewing the dire business rates system, which is unfairly impacting UK high streets and deterring much needed investment.\u201d Of course, this year has brought the Women\u2019s World Cup, and the Cricket one, so we\u2019re not being starved of sport. However, the weather certainly hasn\u2019t been as good as last year. It\u2019s time to break away from parliament, as some alarmingly weak UK retail sales figures just landed! More to follow! Q: Shouldn\u2019t Neil Woodford be forced to stop drawing management fees, having blocked investors from taking their money out. FCA chair Andrew Bailey says it would be \u201ca good thing\u201d if Woodford stopped claiming these fees, although on the other hand Woodford is managing the fund more than ever! Bailey adds that the regulator will also probe Hargreaves Lansdown over the fee reductions it negotiates on its favourite funds. Those savings are passed onto customers, but there are still concerns that they distort the market. Q: Is the Woodford crisis a failure of rules, or a failure of regulation? It\u2019s a failure of rules, says top regulator Andrew Bailey firmly (and not at all biasedly). Q: So the rules need changing? Yes. Q: Will Brexit allow the FCA to shake off its current EU rules-based, \u2018tick-box\u2019, regulation and focus more on principles (as Bailey alluded to) FCA chair Charles Randall takes this point sympathetically. A freer hand will allow the FCA to look more at outcomes, he says. Randall also explains that the FCA (set up a decade ago) is still trying to improve. His personal view is that the first period of the FCA\u2019s existence was dominated by misconduct problems from the financial crisis. It is now trying to become a more outward-looking regulator, Randall adds. Nicky Morgan MP is concerned by the idea that the FCA could slacken off on rules -- many of which were brought in after the financail crisis. Q: How aware will someone like Neil Woodford be of \u2018principles\u2019, unless the FCA shows it is watching closely? Bailey says this is a very fair point, but adds that companies can hide behind the rules book when things go wrong. Q: What about Hargreaves Lansdown\u2019s role in the Woodford crisis? Andrew Bailey says the FCA is pursuing Hargreaves over its Wealth 50 list of \u2018favourite\u2019 funds. Were they too slow to take Woodford\u2019s fund off the list, he asks? Some early reaction to the FCA/Woodford hearing: Andrew Bailey also concedes that the Woodford fund would have been suspended sooner if the UK used a \u201cprinciples based system\u201d, not simply a rules-based one. But he denies that suspending the fund is a bad result -- it\u2019s better than a firesale of assets. This fund has to manage the shrinkage. Q: The Woodford Equity Income fund was worth \u00a310bn at its peak - what\u2019s it worth today? Between \u00a33.5bn and \u00a34bn, Bailey replies. Q: Is that due to redemptions, or poor performance? Mostly redemptions. Q: But isn\u2019t this fund basically a dog? Bailey points out that Neil Woodford\u2019s career has seen periods of poor performance, and period of strong outperformance - that\u2019s how he built his following. The Treasury committee are now criticising Andrew Bailey for not moving faster when Neil Woodford tried to list some of his illiquid holdings on the Guernsey Stock Exchange. Bailey says that Guernsey did call the FCA, but the call somehow went astray. A second call, on 26 April, led to a meeting in May. Bailey disputes Guernsey\u2019s claim that they only discussed the situation in early June (around the time Woodford froze his fund). He claims the FCA thought it was fully briefed on 8 May. Committee chairman Nicky Morgan isn\u2019t impressed, saying the FCA should simply be more proactive in monitoring the markets and protecting consumers. Q: Does anyone at the FCA actually read the newspapers? Yes, Bailey replies defensively. Q: So why didn\u2019t you spot that the media were worried about Woodford? Bailey says a Citywire article triggered the FCA\u2019s concerns about Woodford. Over in parliament, the Treasury Committee have begun their session on \u201cThe work of the Financial Conduct Authority\u201d. In the hot seats - CEO Andrew Bailey and chairman Charles Randell. It\u2019s being streamed online here. MPs start by asking the FCA about fund manager\u2019s Neil Woodford\u2019s suspended Equity Income fund, which has locked hundreds of thousands of investors out. Q: The FCA were first informed that Woodford had breached the 10% limit on illiquid assets in 2017 - so why was the problem not tackled? Bailey says the FCA put Woodford into an enhanced liquidity monitoring system the second time this rule was breached - a a rare move. This meant the FCA was aware that customers had started pulling money out in recent months. Q: But shouldn\u2019t you have asked more questions about the time it would take to sell assets to cover redemptions? Bailey says the FCA was monitoring the pace of outflows vs Woodford\u2019s sales of assets (to pay for those redemptions). Those outflows \u201clooked manageable\u201d, the FCA chief says. He then reveals that the FCA pushed Woodford to find an independent valuer of its various assets. Bailey says the FCA \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d about the role played by Link Fund Solutions -- Woodford\u2019s authorised corporate director who was meant to value assets that weren\u2019t listed on stock markets (and were thus hard to sell quickly - a key reason Woodford couldn\u2019t keep up with customer demands for their money back). An update on the Southern Water scandal -- the company now faces prosecution by the Environment Agency, on top of today\u2019s \u00a3126m penalty for \u201cshocking\u201d failures at its sewage treatment sites. Southern\u2019s CEO Ian McAulay, who joined in 2017, admitted on the BBC Today Programme that it is \u201cperfectly reasonable to say there was dishonesty\u201d before he joined, in the way the company manipulated its wastewater sampling process and misreported sewage treatment site performance. Analyst Michael Brown of Caxton FX says the markets are in a risk-off mood today: As you can see from this chart, gold has surged dramatically this month to this morning\u2019s six-year highs. At $1,430-ish/ounce, gold is still someway shy of its record high of around $1,900 set in 2011. Back then, traders reckoned that record low interest rates and quantitative easing would drive inflation up, making gold a good way to preserve capital. Han Tan, Market Analyst at FXTM, reckons gold has more upside: Gold\u2019s lure has only increased amid intensified fears over the global growth outlook that has been severely dampened by US-China trade tensions that have lasted for nearly a year. The now enlarged scope of the US-China conflict, expanding beyond trade to include the tech sector, along with the displays of brinksmanship that have unfolded in recent weeks, creates a narrative that should keep Gold\u2019s allure intact. Back in the UK, utility provider Southern Water has been slapped with a record-breaking \u00a3126m fine, for some shocking failures at its sewage treatment sites. Southern has apologised, after the regulator found it failed to operate a number of sewage treatment works properly, including not making the necessary investment, which led to equipment failures and spills of wastewater. Campaigners for the re-nationalisation of public services say the sorry episode shows private companies can\u2019t be trusted with such vital tasks. Analyst Naeem Aslam of Think Markets is confident that gold will keep climbing. He thinks it could soon hit $1,550 per ounce, up more than another hundred dollars. Why? The tensions between the US and Iran are one factor, as is the weaker US dollar (which pushes up the cost of commodities priced in $). But there\u2019s another reason. The boom in bond prices means more debt is only offering a negative yield (ie, you actually lose money by holding the bond until it matures). In that environment, gold looks more attractive. Aslam writes: An important factor which investors should be paying attention to is the correlation between the gold price and the size of the negative-yield debt. The chart below shows that there is a strong correlation which means that the gold price rises as the size of the negative yield debt increases. This makes perfect sense, of course, no one likes to have negative yield debt. The safer bet is the shining metal. Given the current monetary policy adopted by the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve bank, it is likely that the gold price may actually touch $1550 in the next few months. Gold actually got as high as $1,438/ounce in choppy overnight trading (highest since May 2013), before settling around $1,430 now. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says a \u201cperfect blend of supporting factors\u201d is responsible for its surge. Four things are really driving gold \u2013 falling yields, a weaker dollar, a soft macroeconomic outlook and geopolitical risks rising in the Middle East. Gold has risen to $1,430, as Iran\u2019s president launches a broadside at Donald Trump. President Rouhani, in a TV speech, declared that America\u2019s new financial sanctions on top Iranians will fail. He also insisted that the restrictions on supreme leader Khamenei will fail, as he doesn\u2019t own any foreign assets anyway. Dubbing the White House \u201cretarded\u201d, Rouhini also accuses the US of lying about seeking talks with Tehran. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index of leading blue-chip shares has fallen 40 points at the start of trading, down 0.5% to 7,375 points. Other European markets are also dipping, following the losses in Asia overnight. This has pulled the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index down by 0.4%. Precious metals miners are bucking the trend, though. Fresnillo (Mexico\u2019s largest gold producer) is up 1% in London. Bitcoin is also rallying today --- up another 2% to $11,267, a 15-month high. While gold climbs, Asian stocks are ending the day in the red. After a weak session, China\u2019s CSI 300 stock index has closed down 1%. Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng shed 1.3% while Japan\u2019s Nikkei dipped by 0.4%. Gold\u2019s rally shows no signs of stopping, reports Bloomberg, thanks to geopolitical issues around the globe. It says: Bullion\u2019s been on a tear this month as the dollar weakened after the Fed opened the door to an interest rate cut and other central banks also pivoted to a more dovish stance. Investors are taking note -- pouring into exchange-traded funds backed by the precious metal and boosting net long positions in U.S. gold futures and options. Morgan Stanley said gold is its top commodity pick on a six-month view as the uncertain macroeconomic outlook adds to its appeal. \u201cThe global capital market\u2019s mood is shaky due to the fear of the unknowns and it\u2019s this uncertainty that will continue to provide the jet fuel for an already high-octane gold market,\u201d Stephen Innes, managing partner at Vanguard Markets Pte, said in a note. The gold price has jumped by over 10% this month, rising from $1,288/ounce at the end of May to $1,426 this morning. Alfonso Esparza, a senior market analyst at OANDA, believes bullion could surge higher, if the US and China can\u2019t reach a trade deal at the G20 meeting. He writes: \u201cThe main event this week will be the sidebar meeting between Trump and Xi, which could stop the current gold rally with a productive sit-down that ends up in a trade agreement,\u201d \u201cThe flip side could boost gold prices even further as the Trump administration has shown that it could turn from friendly to aggressive in a heartbeat further fuelling investor\u2019s demand for a safe haven.\u201d Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Jitters over the US-China trade war and tensions in the Middle East continue to buffet markets. Overnight, Iran has hit back at America\u2019s decision to impose new sanctions on its supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying it has slammed the door of diplomacy shut. So, with president Trump accusing Iran of \u201cincreasingly provocative actions\u201d, the threat of military action in the Gulf hasn\u2019t gone away. Most Asian stock markets have dipped overnight, and we\u2019re expecting a weaker start in Europe too. Investors have one eye on the Middle East, and another on the upcoming G20 meeting of world leaders in Japan. The markets would like to see Trump cut a ceasefire deal with president Xi. But China isn\u2019t rolling over; yesterday, Chinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said both sides need to compromise. Hawkish US officials aren\u2019t in the mood to compromise on issues like forced technology transfer, though. So faced with this picture, investors are piling into safe-haven assets. Gold has hit a six-year high today, currently changing hands at $1,426 per ounce for the first time since 2013 (when eurozone crisis worries were raging). That\u2019s an increase of nearly 1%, adding to recent gains. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, analyst at London Capital Group, says money is \u201cpouring into gold\u201d. She adds: Investors are reluctant to move their capital elsewhere in the middle of a worsening US-Iran thunderstorm and ahead of the G20 summit. Traders are also shunning the US dollar, which is on its longest losing stretch in a year and a half. They\u2019re expecting the Federal Reserve to start slashing interest rates next month, especially now Trump is accusing them of childish incompetence... Also coming up today In London, MPs will be questioning the Financial Conduct Authority. Andrew Bailey, head of the City watchdog, can expect some tough questions over the Neil Woodford crisis. We\u2019re also expecting new UK retail sales figures, and US consumer confidence and housing data -- which may bolster the case for an interest rate cut.

      "bodyText": "Austria\u2019s highest court has upheld a decision making it possible to extradite Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian tycoon facing bribery-related charges in the US. Before his arrest in 2014, Firtash wielded significant political influence in Ukraine, where he had made a fortune from deals to import gas from Russia and central Asia and built a business empire worth billions. He was a close confidant of the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who was ousted in the Maidan revolution in February 2014. A US grand jury indictedFirtash and five others on suspicion of bribing Indian government officials in deals involving supplies of titanium that could have affected the aircraft manufacturer Boeing. Firtash has denied any wrongdoing and has said the charges against him are politically motivated. His lawyers have also said the US should not have jurisdiction in the case. In 2015 an Austrian court agreed, declining a US request for extradition, but that decision was reversed by a higher court in 2017 and the reversal was upheld on Tuesday. \u201cWe are disappointed in today\u2019s decision by the Austrian supreme court,\u201d his lawyers said in a statement. \u201cIn any event, nothing has changed regarding Mr Firtash\u2019s innocence and the absence of evidence that he is guilty of any crime.\u201d Austria\u2019s justice minister will make a final decision on whether to turn Firtash over to a federal court in Chicago. Firtash posted a record bail bond of \u00a3100m but was barred from leaving Austria while the extradition case was ongoing. Firtash\u2019s arrest has largely kept him out of politics in Ukraine since the 2014 revolution, leading to speculation that the criminal case against him was politically motivated. In a 2016 interview with the Guardian, Firtash denied pushing Russian interests in Ukraine but said he had called on others to have closer talks with Russia. \u201cI told everyone we should bring Russia to the table and discuss it all together,\u201d Firtash said. \u201cPeople say I want to swap democracy for cheap gas \u2013 I want to have both. I would like to have European values. But let\u2019s be honest, if we turn one way or the other, we lose a lot. We can\u2019t be without Russia, because for us it\u2019s a huge market. But we don\u2019t want to lose Europe either. Why do we have to choose?\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 27 June 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said Firtash was a former business partner of the former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Representatives for Firtash say he turned down a business deal proposed by Manafort.",

In the game, \u201cBeing Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s assistant for the day\u201d, the object is simple: don\u2019t get fired \u2013 and it\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds. Celebrities who might know a thing or two about having personal assistants have had trouble themselves, including Questlove, who tweeted that he \u201cfailed the first time\u201d. Chrissy Teigen said that she only made it about three rounds, while her own assistant got fired immediately. While the choices on any given prompt might seem obvious to members of the Beyhive, the difficulty comes in trying to anticipate the whims of a Beyonc\u00e9 character who, at least in this game, seems like something of a tyrant. Asked which of her children you should suggest she FaceTime at one turn in the game, if you choose incorrectly you are let go on the spot. It\u2019s not entirely clear why getting yelled at and terminated by Beyonc\u00e9 is such an avid fantasy for so many, but contemporary fandom is strange, and who are we to judge? The person behind the game is Landon Rivera, a student in Los Angeles. He made the game for obsessive Beyonc\u00e9 fans, he told Vice, \u201cbut then it got really popular\u201d. It has been retweeted almost 100,000 times in the few days since he posted it. \u201cI\u2019d probably end up fired if I was her assistant,\u201d Rivera he said. \u201cI\u2019d definitely try to ask her all kind of questions, like how long did it take to get Lemonade ready, did she have [the] Everything Is Love album planned, why didn\u2019t she release the Formation world tour DVD?\u201d Of course, there is the slim chance that Beyonc\u00e9 herself is behind this and it\u2019s all real, as actor Shay Mitchell tweeted.",

The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.<br></p>\n    <p>At its core, the JCPOA is a straightforward bargain: Iran\u2019s acceptance of strict limits on its nuclear programme in return for an escape from the sanctions that grew up around its economy over a decade prior to the accord. Under the deal, Iran unplugged two-thirds of its centrifuges, shipped out 98% of its enriched uranium and filled its plutonium production reactor with concrete. Tehran also accepted extensive monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has verified 10 times since the agreement, and as recently as February, that Tehran has complied with its terms. In return, all nuclear-related sanctions were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/16/sanctions-against-iran-to-be-lifted-after-compliance-with-nuclear-deal\">lifted in January 2016</a>, reconnecting Iran to global markets.</p>\n    <p>The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran\">Iran</a>&nbsp;were in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council\u2019s five permanent members \u2013 China, France, Russia, the UK and the US \u2013 and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.</p>\n    <p>On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal.

On Tuesday he was given a two-year restraining order banning him from making any contact with Goodman.",

Europe\u2019s 2003 heatwave resulted in the premature deaths of an estimated 70,000 people. A 2015 report on heatwaves and health, by the World Meteorological Organization and World Health Organization, found early summer heatwaves had been shown to be associated with greater impacts on mortality than later heatwaves of comparable or higher temperatures. A heatmap for France for 27 June, tweeted by the university meteorologist Ruben Hallali, next to the Edvard Munch painting The Scream, was widely shared on social media. From the low to mid-30Cs on Tuesday in parts of Spain, France and Italy, most weather models predict temperatures will rise by Thursday to the low to mid-40Cs in south and central France and north-east Spain, and the upper 30Cs in much of the rest of continental Europe.

Rahmstorf said the current heatwave, following unusually high temperatures last summer that caused increased mortality rates, a decline in crop yields and wildfires inside the Arctic Circle, was consistent with climate scientists\u2019 predictions. \u201cWeather data show that heatwaves and other weather extremes are on the rise in recent decades,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hottest summers in Europe since the year AD1500 all occurred since the turn of the last century: 2018, 2010, 2003, 2016, 2002.\u201d Monthly records were now falling five times as often as they would in a stable climate, Rahmstorf said, adding this was \u201ca consequence of global warming caused by the increasing greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil and gas\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "An EU agency has highlighted the heightened risk of foreign domestic workers in the UK enduring slavery-like conditions but conceded its pan-European study of labour conditions had been impeded by \u201cmafia networks\u201d. The study (pdf) by the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) found exploitative employers had a feeling of impunity across Europe but that legislative gaps in Britain were raised as one of its particular concerns. The report noted that in the UK, Belgium, Greece, Luxembourg and Sweden domestic workers were excluded from legislation capping the number of hours an employer can ask them to work. It also raised the issue of visas for domestic workers from third countries being tied to a specific employer, leaving \u201cdomestic workers to endure exploitative working conditions in order to keep the job which allows them to legally reside in the country of work\u201d. Campaigners have long warned that thousands of foreign domestic workers are being enslaved behind closed doors in some of Britain\u2019s wealthiest neighbourhoods, often by families from the Gulf. All but two of the 10 domestic workers interviewed in the UK by the FRA had been brought to the country by their employer from the Middle East. The UK changed the law in 2016 to allow overseas domestic workers to switch employers within the six-month term of their visa. But critics say employees do not know their rights and are not in a position to look for new work. According to interviews conducted by the agency\u2019s researchers, one Filipino maid working in the UK was denied food by her employer and relied on biscuits taken from hotels and eating the children\u2019s leftovers, the report said. \u201cUndernutrition was a main reason for escaping employers, as workers could no longer survive without food,\u201d the report said of the plight of the domestic workers interviewed in the UK.

One Polish man said of his life in the UK: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me to express and for you to understand the living conditions we were put through. The accommodation and even the place where we were taking a bath, you know the hens were treated better. \u201cThere was no bathroom in the caravan, we had to go about 10 metres to the garage, there was a bathroom there and it\u2019s winter. There was only a bath[tub] there and in the middle of winter you are sitting there having a bath and you blow and you can see the air coming out of your mouth. [\u2026] It was just unimaginable.\u201d Michael O\u2019Flaherty, the FRA\u2019s director, said he hoped the new EU labour authority due to begin work later this year coordinating the member states could help people trapped in servitude. He said: \u201cWe need to do a much better job of regulating domestic labour. It\u2019s too easy to get away with unacceptable behaviour \u2026 When the labour is at home, hidden behind the front door of private residences.\u201d Bulgarian authorities announced on Tuesday that they had broken up a major organised crime ring thought to have smuggled thousands of migrants, predominantly boys aged under 16, from Afghanistan en route to western Europe. They said the gang had been active since early 2017, making weekly transfers of 30 to 40 people at a time.",

      "body": "<h2>HOT HOT HEAT</h2> <p>And so to Africa, where the Cup of Nations has stumbled into action in conditions steamier than Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s rare collection of stamps. It\u2019s made for some sticky pitches and the kind of ponderous football not even Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would be proud of. Mind you, with the thermometer set to reach a sizzling 41C (105.8F) in Ismailia when Cameroon kick off against Guinea Bissau later on, it\u2019s a sorry farce that matches are being played at all. It\u2019s the first tournament that has been held in summer after organisers could no longer bear listening to the loud and prolonged whinging noises emanating from Europe over the loss of players every other winter, so they gave in and voted to shift it. So much for player welfare!</p> <p>And the result is that only the weather has threatened to set the tournament alight so far, with favourites Egypt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/21/egypt-zimbabwe-match-report\">grinding out just a 1-0 win</a> against Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast beating South Africa <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jun/24/ivory-coast-v-south-africa-africa-cup-of-nations-live\">by a single goal</a> in a Cairo sweatbox and second favourites, Nigeria, winning a war of attrition with Burundi thanks to a goal from 2016\u2019s Odion Ighalo. It\u2019s like watching George Graham\u2019s Arsenal on repeat! Oh Afcon, how could you! Understandably, the race for the Golden Boot is not shaping up to be a classic. Just the 20 players share the lead on one goal apiece and not one of them is Mo Salah.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/south-africa-cup-of-nations-mandela-1996-bafana-bafana\">\u2018Mandela brought extra pressure\u2019: the story of South Africa\u2019s Afcon triumph</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But The Fiver\u2019s going to wager that things will get a lot spicier on Tuesday when Ghana come to town. The Black Stars have had a completely normal buildup to a major tournament, with level-headed former Sunderland legend Asamaoah Gyan retiring after learning he was to be stripped of the captaincy only to make a rapid U-turn when the country\u2019s supreme leader, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, got on the blower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/22/ghana-president-convinces-asamoah-gyan-to-come-out-of-24-hour-retirement\">and told him to pick up the toys</a> he had just thrown out of his pram and get on the first flight to Cairo. \u201cA presidential request is one that cannot be disregarded,\u201d sniffed Gyan.</p> <p>He\u2019s since been given the not-at-all-just-made-up-on-the-spot role of \u2018general captain\u2019 by manager Kwesi Appiah, who has handed the regular on-pitch armband to West Ham legend Andr\u00e9 Ayew. The Fiver\u2019s fully expecting combustion in Egypt, with or without the additional agitator of intense heat. Not that Appiah is bothered, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/26/ghana-chaos-sulley-muntari-kevin-prince-boateng-suspended\">he\u2019s used to off-field nonsense</a>. \u201cThe captaincy is nothing,\u201d he shrugged, in the buildup to their opener against Benin. \u201cThe most important thing is to have unity in the camp. I think this is the best camp I have ever witnessed in my six or eight camps with the national team.\u201d It\u2019s a low bar. The Fiver\u2019s backing Ghana to bring some much-needed drama to Afcon but in the searing heat, it will probably be off the pitch.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football\">Join Paul Doyle for Italy 2-0 China in the Women\u2019s World Cup at 5pm BST, then Scott Murray will be on hand to bring you MBM coverage of Netherlands 3-1 Japan at 8pm, Oh, and Paul will be back at 9pm with hot and steamy coverage of Ghana 1-0 Benin in the Cup of Nations.</a></p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cNone of the officials hired me saying what happens to me depends on what I do in the Copa Am\u00e9rica.

      "bodyText": "HOT HOT HEAT And so to Africa, where the Cup of Nations has stumbled into action in conditions steamier than Weird Uncle Fiver\u2019s rare collection of stamps. It\u2019s made for some sticky pitches and the kind of ponderous football not even Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would be proud of. Mind you, with the thermometer set to reach a sizzling 41C (105.8F) in Ismailia when Cameroon kick off against Guinea Bissau later on, it\u2019s a sorry farce that matches are being played at all. It\u2019s the first tournament that has been held in summer after organisers could no longer bear listening to the loud and prolonged whinging noises emanating from Europe over the loss of players every other winter, so they gave in and voted to shift it. So much for player welfare! And the result is that only the weather has threatened to set the tournament alight so far, with favourites Egypt grinding out just a 1-0 win against Zimbabwe, Ivory Coast beating South Africa by a single goal in a Cairo sweatbox and second favourites, Nigeria, winning a war of attrition with Burundi thanks to a goal from 2016\u2019s Odion Ighalo. It\u2019s like watching George Graham\u2019s Arsenal on repeat! Oh Afcon, how could you! Understandably, the race for the Golden Boot is not shaping up to be a classic. Just the 20 players share the lead on one goal apiece and not one of them is Mo Salah. But The Fiver\u2019s going to wager that things will get a lot spicier on Tuesday when Ghana come to town. The Black Stars have had a completely normal buildup to a major tournament, with level-headed former Sunderland legend Asamaoah Gyan retiring after learning he was to be stripped of the captaincy only to make a rapid U-turn when the country\u2019s supreme leader, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, got on the blower and told him to pick up the toys he had just thrown out of his pram and get on the first flight to Cairo. \u201cA presidential request is one that cannot be disregarded,\u201d sniffed Gyan. He\u2019s since been given the not-at-all-just-made-up-on-the-spot role of \u2018general captain\u2019 by manager Kwesi Appiah, who has handed the regular on-pitch armband to West Ham legend Andr\u00e9 Ayew. The Fiver\u2019s fully expecting combustion in Egypt, with or without the additional agitator of intense heat. Not that Appiah is bothered, he\u2019s used to off-field nonsense. \u201cThe captaincy is nothing,\u201d he shrugged, in the buildup to their opener against Benin. \u201cThe most important thing is to have unity in the camp. I think this is the best camp I have ever witnessed in my six or eight camps with the national team.\u201d It\u2019s a low bar. The Fiver\u2019s backing Ghana to bring some much-needed drama to Afcon but in the searing heat, it will probably be off the pitch. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Paul Doyle for Italy 2-0 China in the Women\u2019s World Cup at 5pm BST, then Scott Murray will be on hand to bring you MBM coverage of Netherlands 3-1 Japan at 8pm, Oh, and Paul will be back at 9pm with hot and steamy coverage of Ghana 1-0 Benin in the Cup of Nations. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cNone of the officials hired me saying what happens to me depends on what I do in the Copa Am\u00e9rica. Because if they had then I wouldn\u2019t have taken the job. I\u2019m not handing over my post. If they want to fire them, then fire me. Another coach will come in and the same things will happen, they are asking for results when we can\u2019t provide them. Let\u2019s see who explodes first\u201d \u2013 Hern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez gets his fresh funk on after Ecuador crashed out of the tournament. RECOMMENDED LOOKING David Squires goes there. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI was horrified to read in Big Paper that 37% of British international rugby players and 43% of England cricketers were privately educated, compared with just 5% of international footballers. This outrageous inequality must be corrected immediately by focusing all efforts to Stop Football in the state school sector\u201d \u2013 Tim Cole. \u201cIt\u2019s not really football but this is quite a first three paragraphs for a Big Paper obituary. Norman Stone v Jos\u00e9 Mourinho (in his first Chelsea tenure prime) would have been box office\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cBy Dutch standards, Aloysius Paulus van Gaal is nothing special (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). Pretty boring actually compared to Brighton\u2019s Davy Petrus Wenceslaus Henri Pr\u00f6pper\u201d \u2013 Niels Hermanus Johannes Bartels. \u201cRe: nominative determinism (Fiver letters passim). At the recent Global Water Summit hosted in London, there was a speaker called Lee King\u201d \u2013 Graham Ward. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Tim Cole. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Former South Yorkshire police chief David Duckenfield will face a retrial on a charge of gross negligence manslaughter over the deaths of 96 people at the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough in 1989. Nottingham Forest are involved in a wild legal wrangle involving the club, former owner, Fawaz al-Hasawi, and a replica of the 1959 FA Cup that has gone missing from the City Ground\u2019s trophy cabinet. Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County have given Frank Lampard permission to become Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea manager once \u00a34m compensation has been deposited into the Pride Park money box. Fifa is investigating the behaviour of the Cameroon team during their eventful 3-0 loss to England in the last 16 of the World Cup. Hedvig Lindahl is pumped up like a giant bouncy castle after her spot-kick stop against Canada helped Sweden into the last eight. \u201cIf they doubted I can make any penalty saves, that proved them wrong,\u201d she roared after the 1-0 win. Megan Rapinoe reckons France v USA! USA!! USA!!! in the World Cup quarter-final will be \u201cwild and crazy\u201d, but just hopefully not in the England v Cameroon way. \u201cThis is incredible for the women\u2019s game,\u201d she yee-hawed. \u201cYou have two heavy-hitters meeting. I hope the fans are crazy, there is tons of media around it and it is just a big spectacle.\u201d Fun and games in South America dept. Bury owner Steve Dale has offered to settle some \u2013 but not all \u2013 of the Shakers\u2019 debts, meaning the newly-promoted club are likely to start life in League One on -12 points. And Rotherham have broken their transfer record by splurging \u00a3500,000 on Plymouth striker Freddie Ladapo. \u201cThey sold me a dream of coming here and doing well,\u201d he cheered. STILL WANT MORE? Fancy a spot of late-90s nostalgia? Well here\u2019s Iv\u00e1n Zamorano talking Inter, Real Madrid, Chile and more. Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s exit is an indictment of a club paralysed by short-sightedness under Mike Ashley, says Newcastle fan Harry Savill. And here\u2019s Louise Taylor on the clash of the control freaks that brought the Spaniard\u2019s Tyneside tenure to an end. Don\u2019t use Cameroon\u2019s poor behaviour against England to judge the women\u2019s game in general, writes Eni Aluko.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been filmed at a private garden party telling Conservative members that the NHS absolutely needs to be reformed, as he fired them up for a general election by asking them to be ready to \u201cwallop Jeremy Corbyn\u201d. The frontrunner to be Conservative leader and prime minister was videoed giving a rabble-rousing stump speech to members in Sutton Coldfield on Saturday, the day after the Guardian revealed that police had been called to his girlfriend\u2019s flat following a late-night altercation. Asked by one party member what he would do with the NHS, Johnson told the crowd the health service was a \u201ccrowning glory\u201d but was \u201cnot getting the kind of support and indeed the kind of changes and management that it needs\u201d, suggesting he as prime minister would aim to undertake an overhaul of the health service. He said Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, had once helped him get elected president of the Oxford Union as a student, and together they would \u201csort things out\u201d. In remarks that may alarm those opposed to another reorganisation of the NHS, Johnson said: \u201cIt needs more money but where you are absolutely right is that it needs reform.\u201d His delivery in private appeared to be more energised than at a separate public appearance at a hustings in Birmingham on Saturday, where he refused to answer questions from the moderator Iain Dale about the row with his partner, Carrie Symonds.

Asking for their support, he also promised to \u201cknock Jeremy Corbyn into a cocked hat where he belongs\u201d in an apparent sign his sights are fixed on an election. On policy, he mostly concentrated his 10-minute stump speech \u2013 likely to be repeated to party members across the country \u2013 on the need to improve policing, faster broadband and wealth creation. His biggest applause from members was for his attack on Corbyn for being a \u201cHamas-supporting, antisemitism-condoning, Hugo-Ch\u00e1vez-admiring apologist for the Kremlin\u201d, whom he branded \u201cderanged\u201d for wanting to embark on a programme of renationalisation. The day after the furore over the row, Johnson went to private events in Bicester and Sutton Coldfield as well as the Birmingham hustings. The next day, his whereabouts are unknown but a photograph of mysterious provenance appeared on Monday appearing to show him sitting with Symonds in a Sussex garden on Sunday. Johnson declined 26 times to say how the picture emerged, when it was taken or why it was released to the Mail Online.",

Rush and his collaborator Bert Cole are sanguine as they take in the view, but I\u2019m clutching the railings, summer breeze blowing through the jasmine of my freaking mind. From its birth in 1975 until it was rendered obsolete by bigger kit, this crane lifted loads at Avonmouth Docks in Bristol. Rush and Cole bought it for an undisclosed sum, chopped it into two pieces, and trucked them 30 miles to Glastonbury. \u201cIt was quite a performance,\u201d laughs Cole. \u201cPolice escort and everything. Then we had to put it together again.\u201d He points out all the boltings and weldings, as well as the 10-metre-deep pilings that hold this beautifully incongruous monstrosity in place.

Trans women of colour<a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/chynal-lindsey-trans-black-woman-killed-dallas\"> are being murdered</a>, even in Dallas.

Little wonder, then, that gay people travel from across the state to spin their spurs at the saloon.</p> \n<p>After 33 years at the bar, Pierce and Miller are thinking of hanging up their hats.

Pence, who once said it was \u201cGod\u2019s idea\u201d to stop same-sex couples marrying, has a long history of working against pro-LGBTQ reforms. (Trump once joked Pence would like to <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence?reload=true\">\u201chang\u201d gay people</a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/10/23/the-danger-of-president-pence?reload=true\">.</a>)</p> \n<p>And so the fight was on. The election helped radicalize the queer community. \u201cIt matters now. You being active and paying attention. It matters,\u201d says Gardner.</p> \n<p>Established in 2016 as a politically minded queer venue, The Back Door is tucked down an alleyway behind a car park. A Golden Girls mural adorns its exterior. Inside, the venue is a cosy, crazy den-like space, with wallscovered in zebra stripes and campy unicorn paintings. The gender neutral bathrooms the walls read: \u201cNO MERCY FOR THE PATRIARCHY, BE A SLUT, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BURN THE ICE VANS PLEASE \u2026\u201d</p> \n<p>The Back Door could come across as a little serious if it weren\u2019t for the owners\u2019 determination to have fun. \u201cI feel like this space is part community center, part entertainment center \u2013 because there is so much crap happening right now that sometimes you just need to come dance and forget about it,\u201d says Gardner.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4ac582e02ea0ef57f4ab5e184ea88f466bec8b9c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ac582e02ea0ef57f4ab5e184ea88f466bec8b9c/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Outside the The Back Door in Bloomington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outside the The Back Door in Bloomington, Indiana.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Silverstone/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cLiving joyously is a radical act in a broken world, especially in an unjust world. For people to come here and be their most fabulous selves and let go is an act of resistance,\u201d says Boroski.</p> \n<p>On the night we visit, the bar is having a benefit for sex workers. A zaftig tattooed dancer billed as \u201cVirgin Mary\u201d poledances to Hozier\u2019s Work Song in a jacket that reads: \u201cMake Nazis Scared Again\u201d as a queer crowd collects cash for National Abortion Fund and Red Light Legal. It\u2019s all very woke David Lynch.</p> \n<p>The Back Door is not a space for everyone, and that\u2019s the point. One patron complained online that they didn\u2019t feel safe in the bar and worried there might be a riot \u2013 \u201cor a massacre\u201d, laughs Boroski.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody here,\u201d they say. \u201cThere are plenty of venues for heterosexuals.\u201d And if someone doesn\u2019t like the vibe? \u201cI\u2019m like, fantastic! See you never! Tell Google!\u201d</p> \n<p>As for the future of LGBTQ rights, huge issues remain, Boroski says. Gay people \u2013 and especially white gay men \u2013 have made great strides since Stonewall, but even in the gay community, transphobia and racism are still issues.</p> \n<p>It\u2019s a bitter irony that 50 years after Stonewall, while Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera \u2013 two trans women of colour and two of the main actors in the Stonewall riots \u2013 are being celebrated, trans people are still being \u201cthrown under the bus\u201d, and trans people of colour are \u201cbeing killed left and right \u2013 and nobody gives a shit\u201d, says Boroski. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a fucking problem.\u201d </p> \n<p>If Indiana cracked down on the queers, The Back Door is exactly the sort of place where a riot could start, says Gardner.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn remembrance of Stonewall, keep a brick in your pocket,\u201d says Boroski. <strong>\u201c</strong>Don\u2019t get complacent. But also live joyously, because that is a radical act.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "The gay bar is in trouble. Fifty years after the Stonewall Inn in New York became the symbol for a new wave of gay activism, the three horsemen of the gay bar apocalypse \u2013 gentrification, assimilation and technology \u2013 have hollowed out their numbers. Rising rents have shuttered gay bars; more straight venues are \u201caccepting\u201d of gay patrons; and dating is something people now do with their phones. Even the term \u201cgay bar\u201d looks a little tired as the LGBTQ community finally comes to terms with its many rainbow stripes. Bare numbers are hard to come by, but Yelp calculates the number of gay bars listed on its service fell 16% between 2014 and 2018. It now represents just 0.8% of all bar listings. But across America \u2013 and especially in less progressive states and communities \u2013 the gay bar is as vibrant and vital as it has ever been. It\u2019s a rallying point in times of trial and celebration. It is the pumping heart of a community that, as the Trump administration rolls back its rights, needs its own space more than it has in years. The oasis: Wonderlust in Jackson, Mississippi You can find Wonderlust, the only gay bar in Jackson, Mississippi, on the northern edge of town, just past the Piggly Wiggly supermarket and the duelling discount stores Dollar General and Dollar Tree. Housed in a long, black, squat building, Wonderlust is marked by panels painted in a sort of rainbow flag. The colours are off \u2013 hospital green, shop-soiled peach, sun-bleached eggplant \u2013 as if picked from a paint store\u2019s remainder bin. It\u2019s not much to look at, but a bar on this spot has been a haven for Mississippi\u2019s LGBTQ community for more than 25 years. Mississippi is one of the most conservative states in the US. A majority still disagree with same-sex marriage \u2013 one of just two states \u2013 the other is Alabama \u2013 to still hold that view. A few years ago, a Mississippi pastor even brought a horse in a wedding dress to the federal courthouse to protest against gay marriage. State law means businesses can deny service to queer people if doing so would conflict with their \u201csincerely held\u201d religious beliefs. Gay people here are mostly discreet. Either that or they leave the state. So Wonderlust has become the one public place where they feel safe to be themselves. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of hate in the world,\u201d says Jodi Sullivan, a trans woman and a Wonderlust regular. \u201cIt\u2019s either come here or sit at home.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the Bible belt. Everybody isn\u2019t as accepting of us as other places,\u201d says Drew Gully-Luckett, who, along with his husband John-Corey, is in the process of taking over the bar. Even going out for dinner together in Jackson can have its issues. \u201cIf we sit on the same side of the booth, people will look at us funny,\u201d says Gully-Luckett. \u201cWe don\u2019t hold hands.\u201d A few years ago, protesters picketed the bar. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a large group,\u201d he says, casually. \u201cJust\u201d 10 to 12 men outside in jacked-up trucks, one with a Confederate flag, \u201cyelling Bible verses and telling us we are going to hell, and if we talk to them we\u2019ll be forgiven\u201d. I tell him that sounds terrifying. He shrugs: \u201cIf you just ignore them, there\u2019s nothing they can do.\u201d There are no protests tonight, but as we walk in, a man approaches us asking that we not take his picture or identify him. A prominent sign on the door says the Guardian is filming and interviewing people. He\u2019s a government worker in his 30s. \u201cThey don\u2019t know I\u2019m out,\u201d he says. Inside, everyone is out \u2013 at least for a good time. Wonderlust is a riot of inclusivity. The crowd is young, old, black, white, Hispanic, trans, straight, gay, lesbian, undecided. The music is pumping, there\u2019s a drag show, dancing, laughing, more drinking, pool tables. By 11pm on Saturday, there isn\u2019t a space left on the car park. If there\u2019s a better time to be had for a hundred miles, good luck finding it. But there\u2019s also a layer of sadness draped over this southern charm. Mississippi is stuck in the past. Many of the patrons said they would move if not for financial or family ties. \u201cBeing black and gay in the south \u2013 it\u2019s rough,\u201d says Michael Johnson, a regular who drives close to an hour to come to Wonderlust. And yet he\u2019s hopeful about the future. \u201cThe south has come a long way,\u201d he says. \u201cI see a change. It\u2019s slow, but it\u2019s a change,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard.\u201d He continues: \u201cWhen I first discovered Wonderlust, it was like a burden was lifted off. It gave me a place to come where I could really let go and be myself. It was a place where I felt comfortable enough to be myself and in this damn time you need that.\u201d The LGBTQ community has achieved major victories in recent years, but Curt Sullivan-Ellis, a tall, handsome bearded man in a checked shirt who is also the drag queen London DuMore, says life has got worse under Trump.Legislators in Mississippi have felt empowered to chip away at hard-won rights, he says, and that message has not been lost on the haters. \u201cI feel sometimes I could be attacked,\u201d he says. \u201cI see a lot more hatred. Especially on Facebook. These feelings, they\u2019ve had them forever but now they can come out and talk about it.\u201d Not here, he says: Wonderlust \u201cgives us a place to be without fear or judgment\u201d. The institution: the Round-Up Saloon in Dallas Back in 1986, when Gary Miller and Alan Pierce first started working at the Round-Up Saloon in Dallas, same-sex couples were not allowed to dance together. \u201cIf the police came in, everybody would stop dancing and hang out until they left,\u201d Miller remembers. People were afraid to park their cars close to the bar; cops would take people\u2019s license plate numbers and turn them in to their employers \u2013 which, back in the early days, would mean an automatic termination. How things have changed. At least at Round-Up. Today, the club holds dance classes almost nightly. People from across the state \u2013 and the world \u2013 come to watch cowboys do the Texas two-step. \u201cCowboys can be gay too,\u201d says Miller, with a twinkle in his eye. So strong is the pull of the bar that Lady Gaga visits pretty much every time she\u2019s in town. (\u201cWe have a madhouse that night,\u201d says Miller.) Willie Nelson pops in from time to time. And if you\u2019re not fazed by celebrity sightings, the huge country-themed bar has something for everyone. Handsome Stetsoned bar staff sling tequila and beer to a mixed crowd of all ages, ethnicities and orientations to a soundtrack of country and dance music. Patrons pop in to watch Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race, stay for karaoke, country dancing, a drag show. Big businesses come by the busload to sell Dallas as an inclusive place for their workers. \u201cThere was a battle to be fought \u2013 and we won,\u201d says Miller. At Round-Up, maybe, but for queer people, Texas is still not easy. \u201cSmall-town Texas \u2026 there are two religions: football and Jesus. And if you don\u2019t agree with either of those, you are going to hell,\u201d says the drag queen Sable Scities as she beats her face before the night\u2019s performance. Scities grew up in rural Texas and says for many outside of the big cities little has changed. \u201cI snuck up here when I was 17 and snuck into the clubs because this is where you feel accepted. You\u2019re not going to find that at home a lot of times. Maybe Christmas and your birthday.\u201d Texas is still a difficult state for LGBTQ people. Trans women of colour are being murdered, even in Dallas. Gay couples are still being kicked out of bars for dancing together. Coming out here \u201cis never going to be an easy road\u201d, says Pierce, Round-Up\u2019s co-owner and Miller\u2019s partner. \u201cThere\u2019s progress, but there\u2019s always that hatred.\u201d The bar\u2019s owners organize charity events and back initiatives aimed at tackling the alarming rates of suicide and addiction in the community. Outside the Round-Up and its surrounding gayborhood, Texas conservatives are still fighting the \u201cgood\u201d fight, trying to pass a \u201creligious freedom\u201d bill that would allow businesses to discriminate against the LGBTQ. Little wonder, then, that gay people travel from across the state to spin their spurs at the saloon. After 33 years at the bar, Pierce and Miller are thinking of hanging up their hats. They have their eye on a place in Mexico. Miller\u2019s son, who is straight, will take over. \u201cBut it will always be a gay bar,\u201d he says. \u201cHe knows not to mess with a good thing.\u201d The resistance: The Back Door in Bloomington, Indiana Smoove Gardner and Nicci Boroski won\u2019t forget the night of 8 November 2016 in a hurry. The owners of The Back Door, Bloomington, Indiana\u2019s radical queer bar, had organized a huge party for what they thought was going to be the election of the first female president of the United States. There were beanbags on the floor and hundreds of people sat around, sometimes going outside to smoke and relieve tension. \u201cAnd then, as things started to go south, people started to get very drunk and very sad,\u201d says Boroski, who identifies as gender queer and uses the they pronoun. \u201cIt was just piles of people cuddling and weeping together by the end of the night.\u201d Trump\u2019s election was an especially bitter blow because it ushered in Mike Pence, Indiana\u2019s former governor, as the vice-president. Pence, who once said it was \u201cGod\u2019s idea\u201d to stop same-sex couples marrying, has a long history of working against pro-LGBTQ reforms. (Trump once joked Pence would like to \u201chang\u201d gay people.) And so the fight was on. The election helped radicalize the queer community. \u201cIt matters now. You being active and paying attention. It matters,\u201d says Gardner. Established in 2016 as a politically minded queer venue, The Back Door is tucked down an alleyway behind a car park. A Golden Girls mural adorns its exterior. Inside, the venue is a cosy, crazy den-like space, with wallscovered in zebra stripes and campy unicorn paintings. The gender neutral bathrooms the walls read: \u201cNO MERCY FOR THE PATRIARCHY, BE A SLUT, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT, BURN THE ICE VANS PLEASE \u2026\u201d The Back Door could come across as a little serious if it weren\u2019t for the owners\u2019 determination to have fun. \u201cI feel like this space is part community center, part entertainment center \u2013 because there is so much crap happening right now that sometimes you just need to come dance and forget about it,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cLiving joyously is a radical act in a broken world, especially in an unjust world. For people to come here and be their most fabulous selves and let go is an act of resistance,\u201d says Boroski. On the night we visit, the bar is having a benefit for sex workers. A zaftig tattooed dancer billed as \u201cVirgin Mary\u201d poledances to Hozier\u2019s Work Song in a jacket that reads: \u201cMake Nazis Scared Again\u201d as a queer crowd collects cash for National Abortion Fund and Red Light Legal. It\u2019s all very woke David Lynch. The Back Door is not a space for everyone, and that\u2019s the point. One patron complained online that they didn\u2019t feel safe in the bar and worried there might be a riot \u2013 \u201cor a massacre\u201d, laughs Boroski. \u201cWe don\u2019t want everybody here,\u201d they say. \u201cThere are plenty of venues for heterosexuals.\u201d And if someone doesn\u2019t like the vibe? \u201cI\u2019m like, fantastic! See you never! Tell Google!\u201d As for the future of LGBTQ rights, huge issues remain, Boroski says. Gay people \u2013 and especially white gay men \u2013 have made great strides since Stonewall, but even in the gay community, transphobia and racism are still issues. It\u2019s a bitter irony that 50 years after Stonewall, while Marsha P Johnson and Sylvia Rivera \u2013 two trans women of colour and two of the main actors in the Stonewall riots \u2013 are being celebrated, trans people are still being \u201cthrown under the bus\u201d, and trans people of colour are \u201cbeing killed left and right \u2013 and nobody gives a shit\u201d, says Boroski. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a fucking problem.\u201d If Indiana cracked down on the queers, The Back Door is exactly the sort of place where a riot could start, says Gardner. \u201cIn remembrance of Stonewall, keep a brick in your pocket,\u201d says Boroski. \u201cDon\u2019t get complacent. But also live joyously, because that is a radical act.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Al Gore has said the global economy requires a fundamental upgrade to become more sustainable in order for the world to survive an environmental crisis and widening social divides. The environmentalist and former US vice-president said the world was in the early stages of a \u201csustainability revolution\u201d that had \u201cthe magnitude of the Industrial Revolution and the speed of the digital revolution\u201d. \u201cThe scale of our global challenges has never been clearer,\u201d Gore said. The urgent need to address the world\u2019s sustainability crisis is laid bare in the latest annual report from Generation Investment Management, which was co-founded by Gore and David Blood, a veteran Goldman Sachs investor, in 2004. The fund has more than $22bn worth of assets under its management, which it invests in technologies that can improve food production, healthcare and energy provision. \u201cWe have entered an age of environmental crises and of widening social divides. Incremental improvements to address these challenges are no longer enough; our economic system requires a fundamental upgrade to sustainability,\u201d Gore said. The report concludes that an environmental breakdown is taking place alongside a fraying of the \u201csocial and economic fabric\u201d. This threatens to create a \u201cdisruptive\u201d, economy-wide sustainability crisis. It says the world\u2019s rising use of fossil fuels and unsustainable food and meat production is accelerating the climate crisis while driving a global healthcare breakdown. Colin le Duc, a partner in Generation, said the world was continuing to grow its use of coal and combustion engine vehicles even though the negative effects of fossil fuels on the climate and human health were well known. Although many countries have set dates to permanently end sales of petrol and diesel cars, 90% of children now breathe toxic air, according to the report. Meanwhile, global obesity levels are rising in line with a growing global appetite for meat and packaged foods despite warnings that healthcare is an unsustainable cost for most governments. The report says there are now more overweight people in the world than underweight people for the first time in history. This is in part due to rising meat consumption. On a per capita basis, meat consumption in China has more than doubled in the last 30 years but still lags behind that of the US by about 50%. The dual impact of a health and climate breakdown could be made worse by a growing divide between rich and poor, which risks encouraging populist politics and global geopolitical instability. This political upheaval could spell bad news for global markets and economic systems while investors and policymakers try to adapt to the crisis. \u201cIt is clear that the way we are organising ourselves is not working,\u201d Le Duc said. The report says the scale of the transformation needed is unprecedented and will mean \u201ctransitioning away from an incumbent energy system we have relied upon for more than 150 years, a revolution in global food systems \u2013 and much more.\u201d Le Duc urged investors to embrace the \u201cnuanced complexity of the transition to a sustainable economy\u201d when assessing which companies offer sound investments in the coming decades. Gore said advances in technology, business model innovation and policy changes were \u201call aligning with society\u2019s increasing demand for zero-carbon, equitable and inclusive economic growth\u201d. The cost of renewable energy and electric cars is falling, while meat substitutes and alternative proteins have broken through into the mainstream. Meanwhile, investors have divested more than $7tn from fossil fuels. A sustainable economy would require even greater shifts from the global investment community, according to Le Duc. \u201cThere are plenty of investors that need to wake up to sustainability. Around $17tn is being invested with environment and social governance considerations \u2013 that\u2019s a lot of money but it\u2019s a very small proportion of global capital,\u201d he said. He said a deeper understanding of the systemic shifts under way across all sectors was required by business leaders. \u201cThis represents the biggest investor opportunity ever writ in history. The economy has never been as big as it is today, and has never needed as much change.\u201d",

Forest\u2019s position is that the trophy is the property of the club and their supporters and that it is not a question of costs, more the integrity of the matter. The club do not accept that Hasawi has any right to regard himself as the trophy\u2019s owner or keeper. He has received a legal letter along those terms and, speaking to the Guardian, the Kuwaiti appeared ready to back down. \u201cIf this is an issue I will bring the cup tomorrow to the club,\u201d Hasawi said. \u201cAnd I will give it to them for free. I bought this with my own money. I am the one who put the money in the club. And I am the one who gave the authority to bring the cup. I will bring them the cup tomorrow. The cup is not an issue. It\u2019s only \u00a323,000. I am the one who ordered the cup and I am the one who took the cup. \u201cWith all respect to all the previous owners \u2013 I don\u2019t want to mention any names, I wish them all the best and I respect all of them who owned that great club \u2013 when I came to the club [in 2012] there was no cups. All the previous owners took the cups. I didn\u2019t make a big scene about it. There were many missing cups. I didn\u2019t say a word.\u201d Hasawi\u2019s chaotic period as Forest\u2019s owner led to fan protests and, two years since the Greek shipping magnate Evengelos Marinakis completed his takeover, the latest dispute comes at a time when the two parties are locked in a separate legal battle about the terms of the sale. When Hasawi relinquished his position in 2017 the newly appointed chairman, Nicholas Randall QC, talked about inheriting a club that was \u201cin intensive care\u201d and \u201cnot fit for purpose\u201d, with plummeting crowds, a skeleton staff and a team that had avoided relegation into League One by goal difference. Under their Greek ownership, Forest posted their highest average home attendance for 40 years in finishing ninth in the Championship last season and are working on plans to redevelop the City Ground into the largest football stadium in the east Midlands. However, a high court judge last month ordered the club to pay Hasawi \u00a34.2m relating to his claims that he was still owed money. Forest have subsequently won permission to take that to an appeal and the club announced last week they were \u201cdisappointed with the aggressive stance\u201d of their former owner. As well as filling a conspicuous space in their trophy cabinet, one of the reasons why Forest have been so keen to be reunited with the FA Cup is because of a scheme they recently launched, entitled Dream Big, which involves taking the club\u2019s most precious items of silverware into Nottingham\u2019s schools. Until now, it has not been possible to include the 1959 replica but that may soon be about to change. \u201cWhen I bought the club from the [Nigel] Doughty family, this cup wasn\u2019t in the club,\u201d Hasawi said. \u201cThe cup is not an issue for me. If they want the cup tomorrow, I will get you the cup. I have it at home. I can take it back, no problem.\u201d",

And last week research suggested that more people than ever in the province, 50%, say they are \u201cneither unionist nor nationalist\u201d. The Northern Ireland Life and Times survey finds that half the population does not identify with the two main tribal groups who want to see sovereignty lie with either London or Dublin. At the same time the censuses have found a gradual rise in the number of people who consider themselves Northern Irish (as opposed to Irish or British) \u2013 people such as the golfer Rory McIlroy (born in 1989), whose background is Catholic but who attended a non-Catholic school and said he felt more of a connection to the UK than Ireland. It is not easy to reconcile these contrasting realities of deep division and a growing repudiation of sectarian labels. In the recent European elections, the combined centre vote (including Greens) rose to 21% \u2013 easily the highest achieved by nonaligned parties since the 1960s. But almost 80% still vote unionist or nationalist.

Apolitical people in affluent societies often do not vote, such as in US presidential elections where turnout is around half of the electorate. Northern Ireland\u2019s turnout is traditionally lowest in the wealthiest constituency, North Down. But there has always been a degree of indifference towards religious groupings in Northern Ireland, despite it having higher rates of allegiance to the Christian churches than Great Britain. Professed religious faith is more akin to that seen in the US than in secular England, yet as far back as 1968, the year the Troubles erupted, weekly church attendance among Anglicans and Presbyterians in Northern Ireland was below 50% (it was much higher among Catholics, at over 90%). Those numbers have been in relentless decline over the last half century, particularly among Ulster Catholics. Shunning the political divisions that accompany religious ones (Protestants overwhelmingly favour the UK link, while Catholics mostly long for Irish unity) has been a slow process, yet there were always people who did that.

Much of the vote that now goes to those parties, which between them often win more than half the vote, does so precisely because they are no longer seen as extreme. One simplistic way to look at Northern Ireland\u2019s voting allegiances is to think in terms of thirds: a third feel strongly unionist, a third feel strongly nationalist, and a third feel less strongly either.

      "body": "<p>Moments before the biggest match of his life was due to begin, Roscoe Tanner locked himself in the bathroom of the changing room at the All England Club. Playing Bj\u00f6rn Borg at Wimbledon could do that to a man. This was 1979 and the ice-cold Borg was a big favourite to win the title for a fourth consecutive year while Tanner, a blond left-hander with a hammer for a serve, was in the final for the first time.</p> <p>Tanner wasn\u2019t afraid, though \u2013 not even of Borg, who had made Wimbledon a fortress. This wasn\u2019t fear. The champion on grass at the Australian Open a couple of years earlier, Tanner had a game made for grass, his lefty serve \u2013 once recorded at 153mph \u2013 a vicious weapon. And yet, as officials waited for him to come out at the scheduled time, he just sat, stalling.</p> <p>The American broadcaster NBC, which was showing Wimbledon live for the first time that year, had asked for the start time to be delayed by a few minutes, to allow their commentators to set up the final. The request was denied but Donald Dell, Tanner\u2019s agent and also an NBC commentator, asked Tanner if he could take matters into his own hands. At first, Tanner refused.</p> <p>\u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ve been fighting my whole life to get to this match, and to delay it \u2013 I might get point penalties or all kinds of problems that could develop from me not being ready when they call me,\u2019\u201d he says now. \u201cSo I said: \u2018No, I won\u2019t do it,\u2019 and he said: \u2018OK,\u2019 and he left. Then I was sitting there and I thought: \u2018There is one way I can.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Leo Turner, the locker\u2011room attendant, approached Tanner to take him to the court, the American said his stomach was acting up and that he needed to go to the bathroom. \u201cSo I went into one of the stalls and locked the door and I just sat on the toilet, Tanner recalls. \u201cHe kept knocking, saying: \u2018Mr Tanner, Mr Tanner, we\u2019ve got to go,\u2019 and I said: \u2018Leo, I can\u2019t yet.\u2019 I was just sitting there looking at my watch. I saw it was about eight minutes and I said: \u2018OK, let\u2019s go,\u2019 and went out on the court.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9de8c7a01e4521abf9399477ec020e6525c46804\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9de8c7a01e4521abf9399477ec020e6525c46804/0_15_2192_1315/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roscoe Tanner powers his way to the net in the 1979 Wimbledon Men\u2019s Final against Bjorn Borg\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tanner powers his way to the net in the 1979 Wimbledon final against Borg. \u2018Overall I feel like he raised his game and beat me, so that\u2019s OK,\u2019 says Tanner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colorsport/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the 40 years since then, Tanner has been no stranger to controversy \u2013 of a more serious kind. He has been jailed four times, once in Germany and three times in the US, for charges relating to writing dodgy cheques and failing to pay child support. He has spent much of the past three decades in financial difficulty and for a long time was estranged from his five daughters.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Really I thought I had a great chance against Bjorn, because I\u2019d beaten him earlier that year in Philadelphia</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1979, though, he was in his pomp.

If I played him on clay I\u2019d have had a different feeling.\u201d</p> <p>And he had his chances, winning the first and third sets as it went to a decider. In the final set he held two break points at 4-3, 15-40 \u2013 only to blink. \u201cI hit a very good return, he was coming to net, which is where you would like Bj\u00f6rn to be, and he hit a volley and popped it up about three\u2011quarter court, easy to my forehand,\u201d Tanner says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, cool, I\u2019m looking to hit it down the line but I want to make him think I\u2019m going to hit it cross\u2011court, so I wanted to hold it for a beat. He covered cross-court and I hit it about three inches wide. So that was a chance to have a break in the fifth set.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1af04918fe64e2af83957ee3c2e48c0442bd75ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1af04918fe64e2af83957ee3c2e48c0442bd75ae/167_418_596_745/400.jpg\" alt=\"Roscoe Tanner practising in Orlando in June 2019\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roscoe Tanner practising in Orlando in June 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roscoe Tanner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Four decades on the disappointment is still there, but overall the feeling is one of pride after he was ultimately beaten 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. \u201cThere\u2019s always a slight nagging feeling but I\u2019d say overall it\u2019s an exceptionally good feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the finals of Wimbledon, which to me is the event. Sure I would love to have won, that\u2019s the nagging feeling. But I was in the final and it was a good final. I\u2019d have a different feeling if I\u2019d lost like 2, 2 and 2. But it was a good final, I trained hard for it and I played well. Couple of shots that I missed that I wouldn\u2019t like to have missed, but overall I feel like he raised his game and beat me, so that\u2019s OK. He didn\u2019t beat me by much. Then later in the year, in the quarter-finals at the US Open, I beat him. That was a tiny bit of revenge. I can be honest and say that, it was on my mind. I would have traded my quarter-final for his final, but I did it.\u201d</p> <p>Tanner won 15 singles events, including one grand slam title and total prize money of \u00a31.67m. Considering that the singles winners at this year\u2019s Wimbledon will pick up \u00a32.35m each, does he think he was unlucky to have played when he did? \u201cIf I was born in the wrong time, think about [Rod] Laver,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were pretty fortunate, we were getting paid to play a game and as far as we were concerned it was big money then, way bigger than the guys before us. But Borg won five Wimbledons in a row. If you take all those cheques and add them together, it\u2019s [only just over half] what [Stefan] Edberg won [when he secured the title in 1988].

The UK would no longer be paying into the EU budget, nor would it hand over the \u00a339bn divorce payment.</p>\n    <p>The UK would drop out of countless arrangements, pacts and treaties, covering everything from tariffs to the movement of people, foodstuffs, other goods and data, to numerous specific deals on things such as aviation, and policing and security. Without an overall withdrawal agreement each element would need to be agreed. In the immediate aftermath, without a deal the UK would trade with the EU on the default terms of the World Trade Organization (WTO), including tariffs on agricultural goods.</p>\n    <p>The UK government has already indicated that it will set low or no tariffs on goods coming into the country. This would lower the price of imports \u2013 making it harder for British manufacturers to compete with foreign goods. If the UK sets the tariffs to zero on goods coming in from the EU, under WTO \u201cmost favoured nation\u201d rules it must also offer the same zero tariffs to other countries.<br></p>\n    <p>WTO rules only cover goods \u2013 they do not apply to financial services, a significant part of the UK\u2019s economy. Trading under WTO rules will also require border checks, which could cause delays at ports, and a severe challenge to the peace process in Ireland without alternative arrangements in place to avoid a hard border.<br></p>\n    <p>Some no-deal supporters have claimed that the UK can use article XXIV of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) to force the EU to accept a period of up to 10 years where there are no tariffs while a free trade agreement is negotiated. However, the UK cannot invoke article XXIV unilaterally \u2013 the EU would have to agree to it. In previous cases where the article has been used, the two sides had a deal in place, and it has never been used to replicate something of the scale and complexity of the EU and the UK\u2019s trading relationship.</p>\n    <p>The director general of the WTO, Roberto Azev\u00eado, has <a href=\"https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/economics-and-finance/jumping-from-league-one-to-league-three-wto-insiders-scathing-assessments-of-a-wto-brexit\">told Prospect magazine</a> that \u201cin simple factual terms in this scenario, you could expect to see the application of tariffs between the UK and EU where currently there are none\u201d.</p>\n    <p>Until some agreements are in place, a no-deal scenario will place extra overheads on UK businesses \u2013 eg the current government advice is that all drivers, including lorries and commercial vehicles, will require extra documentation to be able to drive in Europeif there is no deal. Those arguing for a \u201cmanaged\u201d no deal envisage that a range of smaller, sector-by-sector, bilateral agreements could be quickly put into place as mutual self-interest between the UK and EU to avoid introducing or to rapidly remove this kind of bureaucracy.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a></b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In a report, the SMMT said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be \u00a34.5bn, a \u201cknockout blow\u201d to the sector\u2019s competitiveness.</p> \n<p>The industry has already lost two big names in the past year with the closure of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/13/honda-close-swindon-plant-ending-workers-hopes\">Honda in Swindon in 2021</a> and the axing of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/06/ford-to-close-bridgend-factory-in-september-2020\">Ford plant in Bridgend</a> in Wales with the loss of thousands of jobs.</p> \n<p>While neither Honda nor Ford cited Brexit as a cause, the industry fears Britain\u2019s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers.</p> \n<p>Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cWe are already seeing investment stall.

It is now the turn of the UK government to come up with the plan and talk to us [the EU]. \u201cOur mindset is to explore all pathways to come to a negotiated deal.\u201d The German envoy\u2019s comments came as motor industry leaders warned that the cost of car manufacturing would go up \u00a370m a day if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, making the British automotive industry more vulnerable to closures,. They also warned for the second time this year that car prices will go up by an average of \u00a31,500. \u201cLeaving the EU without a deal would trigger the most seismic shift in trading conditions ever experienced by automotive, with billions of pounds of tariffs threatening to impact consumer choice and affordability,\u201d said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) at an industry conference in London. \u201cThe end to borderless trade could bring crippling disruptions to the industry\u2019s just-in-time operating model. Delays to shipments of parts to production plants are measured in minutes, with every 60 seconds costing \u00a350,000 in gross value added \u2013 amounting to some \u00a370m a day in a worst-case scenario,\u201d it added. In a report, the SMMT said the imposition of tariffs for trade in passenger cars along would be \u00a34.5bn, a \u201cknockout blow\u201d to the sector\u2019s competitiveness. The industry has already lost two big names in the past year with the closure of Honda in Swindon in 2021 and the axing of the Ford plant in Bridgend in Wales with the loss of thousands of jobs. While neither Honda nor Ford cited Brexit as a cause, the industry fears Britain\u2019s competitiveness and unstable political environment will deter future investment by global car manufacturers. Mike Hawes, the SMMT chief executive, said: \u201cWe are already seeing investment stall. As a manufacturer you constantly invest in machinery to make sure you are more efficient, make sure you are competitive. \u201cWhen the big investment decisions come with a new model, that\u2019s when you are competing with other plants, that\u2019s when you need to be at your most efficient and if in the previous two or three years you have underinvested it makes it much harder.\u201d Few car companies want to go public on their fears over Brexit because of the backlash in the media and some political interests, sources say. Hawes said the analysis of tariffs was based on facts, on industry and government data and warned that his pleas were not fearmongering. \u201cWe are not making claims that the entire industry will close doors overnight, this industry is adaptable and agile, but it can only do so much if the barriers are particularly high,\u201d he said. He warned the industry would decline with a \u201cdeath by a thousand cuts\u201d. Costs could be hit by stoppages in production lines in the event of delays to supply of components over the Calais-Dover transit route and also by the imposition of tariffs of between 2% and 4.5% by the EU. The car industry has little to no warehousing capacity to stockpile in the event of no deal with production based on just-in-time and just-in-sequence systems. \u201cWe have 1,100 vehicles a day coming into the UK with parts, components, we need them to move seamlessly.

They were trying to play on everyone\u2019s fears,\u201d Gleicher said.</p> <p>He said that effort had been thwarted because the US government had found the accounts a few days earlier and warned Facebook to remove them, and because the state, industry and civil society had all independently said they had not seen any large-scale manipulation in the weeks leading up to the election.</p> <p>\u201cBut this technique, of preying on everyone\u2019s fears, we expect to see a lot more of. And quite frankly it\u2019s an interestingly challenging problem to deal with because they\u2019re forcing you to prove a negative. They\u2019re forcing all of us to prove a negative. Prove that there wasn\u2019t manipulation. Which is incredibly challenging.\u201d</p> <p>Other spheres of discourse have already taken a hit. In February, BuzzFeed News reported on the trouble that some American black activists were having in trying to convince online interlocutors that they were not fake accounts.</p> <p>\u201cEverybody is a bot now and no one can have a real conversation,\u201d Shireen Mitchell, the founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryancbrooks/black-activists-twitter-bots-2020-election-trolls\">told the website</a>. \u201cThere are real black people criticising these [Democratic presidential] candidates rightfully, but there are also fake accounts out there just looking to take advantage of any tension they can find in the community.\u201d</p> <p>Gleicher was speaking at the 360/OS conference in London, a meeting of the world\u2019s \u201copen-source intelligence\u201d community including groups such as Bellingcat and Forensic Architecture.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The next wave of \u201cinfluence operations\u201d like those that Russia used to target the 2016 US election will aim to destabilise debate by making voters think bots are everywhere, Facebook\u2019s head of cybersecurity policy has said. Nathaniel Gleicher, who runs the company\u2019s response to politically motivated malfeasance on its platform, said groups such as Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency (IRA) were increasingly trying to manipulate public perception of themselves. \u201cNot running a large network of fake accounts but just playing on the fact that everyone thinks there are large networks of fake accounts out there,\u201d he said. While the St Petersburg-based IRA\u2019s previous tactics required hiding its involvement in debate so as to avoid detection, instead the group will noisily announce its participation in public discourse so as to cast doubt on the authenticity of every other social media user at the same time. \u201cThe best example we saw of this was in the direct lead-up to the US midterms in 2018 when, on the eve of the vote, an actor linked to the IRA, claiming to be the IRA, put up a website that said: \u2018We control public debate in the US and we\u2019ve decided who\u2019s going to win and who\u2019s going to lose,\u2019 and they posted about 100 Instagram accounts as evidence of the tens of thousands of accounts that they had. They were trying to play on everyone\u2019s fears,\u201d Gleicher said. He said that effort had been thwarted because the US government had found the accounts a few days earlier and warned Facebook to remove them, and because the state, industry and civil society had all independently said they had not seen any large-scale manipulation in the weeks leading up to the election. \u201cBut this technique, of preying on everyone\u2019s fears, we expect to see a lot more of. And quite frankly it\u2019s an interestingly challenging problem to deal with because they\u2019re forcing you to prove a negative. They\u2019re forcing all of us to prove a negative. Prove that there wasn\u2019t manipulation. Which is incredibly challenging.\u201d Other spheres of discourse have already taken a hit. In February, BuzzFeed News reported on the trouble that some American black activists were having in trying to convince online interlocutors that they were not fake accounts. \u201cEverybody is a bot now and no one can have a real conversation,\u201d Shireen Mitchell, the founder of Stop Online Violence Against Women, told the website. \u201cThere are real black people criticising these [Democratic presidential] candidates rightfully, but there are also fake accounts out there just looking to take advantage of any tension they can find in the community.\u201d Gleicher was speaking at the 360/OS conference in London, a meeting of the world\u2019s \u201copen-source intelligence\u201d community including groups such as Bellingcat and Forensic Architecture.",

With one ball remaining Nottinghamshire had to score three to win, and steal the Benson and Hedges Cup away from Essex. \u201cTo bowl the last ball was John Lever, 40 years old, 40 years wise,\u201d wrote Mike Selvey in the Guardian. \u201cFacing was Eddie Hemmings, four days older than Lever and no less wise or yeoman-hearted. It was a shoot-out of the old brigade. A game now of bluff, double bluff and raw nerve. Gooch and Lever took an eternity to set the field. Lever breathed deep and set off.\u201d</p> <p>It was 1989; Essex were the most successful side of the decade and apparently on their way to winning everything again. Three times in the 1980s they had won the County Championship, and three times the Sunday league. This year they led them both, topping the county table after 12 of 22 games with a handy 33-point lead over Worcestershire (to put that in context, none of the next four teams were more than 12 points further back), and in the Sunday Refuge Assurance League, having played 11 of their 16 games, they were four points ahead of Lancashire at the top. The Benson and Hedges Cup could have been the first of an improbable, glorious treble.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/that-1980s-sports-blog/2019/jun/24/ian-botham-king-panto-1992-cricket-world-cup\">When Ian Botham played king at the panto and the 1992 Cricket World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They were one ball from the trophy. Just one perfect delivery. At that stage of his career Hemmings had played 13 one-day internationals and had a batting average of four. He also had a groin strain, declaring later that he might not have been able to run a sharp couple had such an effort been required. \u201cI had a little meeting with Bruce French while they were moving the field all over the place for about five minutes,\u201d he remembered. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019d better hit it for four, hadn\u2019t I?\u2019 He said: \u2018No choice.\u2019 Then all of a sudden Goochie moved deep cover over to the leg side, and one of my favourite shots was to back away and hit it through the off side, so that\u2019s what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Lever said: \u201cIf I\u2019d just run up and bowled, I\u2019d have been fine. But we stopped and spent five minutes changing fields around. Third man came up, then back. Fine leg came up, then back. I knew where Eddie was going to go: outside leg stump. My job was to follow him. Standing around, it was a long five minutes. I followed him, but I didn\u2019t quite follow him enough.\u201d</p> <p>Selvey continued: \u201cThe ball was close to perfect \u2013 almost yorker length and outside leg stump. But Hemmings, reading Lever\u2019s mind and trusting Lever\u2019s skill, stepped inside the line and sliced the ball away with horizontal bat.\u201d Brian Hardie, midway through his 39th year, set off in vain pursuit. \u201cIt\u2019s a gamble,\u201d said Gooch. \u201cYou put your fielders where you think the ball will go. There will always be gaps. John bowled it in the right place. Eddie just found one of the gaps. The whole day\u2019s play came down to one ball \u2013 we did our best and lost.\u201d</p> <p>Essex had lost the first leg of the treble and went on to lose the other two as well, coming second in both domestic leagues. Hemmings seemed to forget his injury as he and French spun and whirled in celebration, slapping each other\u2019s backs joyously with bats still clutched in their right fists. It was 30 years ago next month, and remains one of the great domestic limited\u2011overs matches \u2013 or at least among the greatest finales. Selvey declared it \u201cone of the great games of one\u2011day cricket\u201d, though Alan Lee in the Times sniffed that \u201cit was, in many ways, a mundane match, remembered only for its epic climax\u201d.</p> <p>Which is perhaps a little unfair, for there was another classic moment at the other end of the game. In the third over of the match Essex were four without loss, with Hardie yet to score. Franklyn Stephenson had befuddled him with one of his slow balls, and was about to try again. \u201cHardie didn\u2019t worry me as a top batter but if I\u2019d listened to all the rhetoric about him I would probably have got a little uptight because everyone was telling me that he was Nottinghamshire\u2019s nemesis,\u201d Stephenson writes in his new autobiography, My Song Shall be Cricket, which will be published on the 30th anniversary of the 1989 final, 15 July. \u201cStarting proceedings from the pavilion end, I bowled him a few deliveries which climbed nicely and left him trying to keep them down. All good, ease your way into the match, Franky.\u201d</p> <p>Stephenson remains famous for his slow ball. The previous year he had scored 1,000 first-class runs and taken 125 wickets, estimating that a third of them had come with the delivery. He passed his methods on to his flatmate Chris Cairns, who at the time of the 1989 final was a 19\u2011year\u2011old scholar at Nottinghamshire and four months away from his Test debut. Wasim Akram and Steve Waugh both developed a slow ball after watching the Barbadian. Hardie, however, had not been paying attention.</p> <p>\u201cI bowled him a slower ball and he totally missed it,\u201d Stephenson writes. \u201cHe ducked out of the way and was very fortunate that it didn\u2019t bowl him because he never saw the ball and it only narrowly missed his stumps. I was amazed by his reaction. He almost freaked out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBy that stage of my career it wasn\u2019t the greatest surprise in the world that Franklyn Stephenson could bowl a slower ball, eh? I made my mind up to give him another one, to see what his reaction would be this time. He\u2019d been ducking and diving around, giving an impersonation of a blind man holding the bat. A couple of balls later down came another slower one and he played all around it and was bowled, gone for a painful 10-ball duck. Essex were 4-1. Despite all the advances in the modern game people still remember things like that.\u201d</p> <p>There have not been many domestic matches that have proved as dramatic or as memorable, but Stephenson and his slow ball would play a key role in one of them. Four years later, in the NatWest Trophy final, he was delivering the final over for Sussex and Warwickshire needed 15 off it. Dermot Reeve scored 13 off the first five deliveries, leaving Roger Twose, who was yet to score, to find a couple from the last. Stephenson bowled his famous slow ball, Warwickshire won, and Stephenson was forced to feel the pain endured by Lever on that memorable day in July 1989.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email. </em></strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/aug/18/sign-up-to-the-spin\" title=\"\"><strong><em>To subscribe, just visit this page and follow the instructions</em></strong></a></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

The previous year he had scored 1,000 first-class runs and taken 125 wickets, estimating that a third of them had come with the delivery. He passed his methods on to his flatmate Chris Cairns, who at the time of the 1989 final was a 19\u2011year\u2011old scholar at Nottinghamshire and four months away from his Test debut. Wasim Akram and Steve Waugh both developed a slow ball after watching the Barbadian. Hardie, however, had not been paying attention. \u201cI bowled him a slower ball and he totally missed it,\u201d Stephenson writes. \u201cHe ducked out of the way and was very fortunate that it didn\u2019t bowl him because he never saw the ball and it only narrowly missed his stumps. I was amazed by his reaction. He almost freaked out. \u201cBy that stage of my career it wasn\u2019t the greatest surprise in the world that Franklyn Stephenson could bowl a slower ball, eh? I made my mind up to give him another one, to see what his reaction would be this time. He\u2019d been ducking and diving around, giving an impersonation of a blind man holding the bat. A couple of balls later down came another slower one and he played all around it and was bowled, gone for a painful 10-ball duck. Essex were 4-1. Despite all the advances in the modern game people still remember things like that.\u201d There have not been many domestic matches that have proved as dramatic or as memorable, but Stephenson and his slow ball would play a key role in one of them. Four years later, in the NatWest Trophy final, he was delivering the final over for Sussex and Warwickshire needed 15 off it. Dermot Reeve scored 13 off the first five deliveries, leaving Roger Twose, who was yet to score, to find a couple from the last. Stephenson bowled his famous slow ball, Warwickshire won, and Stephenson was forced to feel the pain endured by Lever on that memorable day in July 1989. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

They listen, keep vigil, allow people to talk openly about their impending death and fears, and provide therapeutic support to help alleviate anxiety and pain. This can be through breathing techniques, massage, sound and music therapy and essential oils. As the \u201csoul\u201d in the title suggests, the role also offers a spiritual dimension linked to healing and detachment. But it\u2019s not just about helping people to die without fear, loneliness or anxiety. It\u2019s also about making people realise they are valued, says Warner. \u201cI\u2019m very keen on that because a lot of people we work with don\u2019t have anyone in their lives. Making them feel that they are special is a very big part of our role and to honour them as the people that they have been, because you can be made to feel very anonymous when you\u2019re dying, whether old or young\u201d.</p> <p>The daughter of the former Conservative MP David Mudd, Warner cites the \u201charrowing deaths\u201d of her grandmother \u2013 with whom she had lived after her parents divorced when she was six, who died of lung cancer when Warner was 14 \u2013 and her stepfather two years later that forced \u201can enormous amount\u201d of processing and reflection early on and led her to become a health journalist.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Warner found herself writing a number of features about women dying of breast cancer. Interviewees revealed their loneliness and isolation and the sense of being locked in a room with an elephant in it. \u201cThe biggest thing was the feeling that they couldn\u2019t talk to anybody honestly about the fact they knew they were going to die, because everybody kept saying \u2018we\u2019ll get you through this; you won\u2019t die\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>They talked and Warner listened. \u201cI think there was a healing in that they could just talk frankly about how they really felt to somebody who wasn\u2019t judgmental in any way.\u201d But Warner saw her journalistic boundaries begin to slide as she stepped in to fill unmet needs, such as giving a massage after one of the women confided that \u201cnobody touches me any more\u201d because of her cancer. When the last of six women she had interviewed died, her decision to help dying people full-time was realised.</p> <p>She began volunteering in her local hospice, where she noticed \u201cbig gaps\u201d in care delivery: the \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, for example, that saw everyone \u201cwrapped up with crocheted blankets\u201d and \u201cgiven plastic cups to suck out of\u201d, regardless of their age or their personal needs.</p> <p>\u201cI sat there thinking it would be so useful if someone could join up the dots in what I was seeing with people who were dying.

It\u2019s the best job in the world because I love music, and my love of music involves sharing it with people.\u201d</p> <p>Is it not boring, doing it sober and drug-free, which he has been for a decade now? \u201cI\u2019m a bit like a vampire. I vicariously get my kicks, but instead of suckling the blood of the young, I absorb their sweat. My secret of eternal youth is being around young people having fun. It\u2019s a kind of serotonin-adrenaline-pheromone mix they give off.\u201d</p> <p>And he taps into it? \u201cI think so. I just lose myself. When I\u2019m in that moment, I\u2019m quite intoxicated. I call it euphoric recall: I tap back into my previous misdemeanours, become in that moment with them but without the hangovers and self-loathing.\u201d Is he happier, sober? \u201cIt makes my life way more manageable.

The film is a history of the mythical Mediterranean island \u2013 not just the past 30 years, Cook\u2019s era, but 2,000 years. Before the ravers there were Phoenicians and Moors, Romans, dada poets, beatniks, draft dodgers, fascists. It wasn\u2019t always all smiley faces and euphoria, and if someone had their hands in the air it might have been because they didn\u2019t want to get shot.

      "bodyText": "Superstar DJ Fatboy Slim was recently thinking about \u2013 and questioning \u2013 what it is he does. \u201cI\u2019m just a middle-aged man playing a lot of loud squelching noises to young people, waving his arms around in the air. What really is that?\u201d he asked himself. But then it does make them dance and smile, and he, Norman Cook, still enjoys doing it. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I would have chosen to be doing at this age\u201d \u2013 55 \u2013 \u201cbut I\u2019m loving it so much. It\u2019s the best job in the world because I love music, and my love of music involves sharing it with people.\u201d Is it not boring, doing it sober and drug-free, which he has been for a decade now? \u201cI\u2019m a bit like a vampire. I vicariously get my kicks, but instead of suckling the blood of the young, I absorb their sweat. My secret of eternal youth is being around young people having fun. It\u2019s a kind of serotonin-adrenaline-pheromone mix they give off.\u201d And he taps into it? \u201cI think so. I just lose myself. When I\u2019m in that moment, I\u2019m quite intoxicated. I call it euphoric recall: I tap back into my previous misdemeanours, become in that moment with them but without the hangovers and self-loathing.\u201d Is he happier, sober? \u201cIt makes my life way more manageable. It means I can cope as a father.\u201d Cook has two children with Zo\u00eb Ball, from whom he\u2019s now separated. Nelly, who\u2019s nine, is into Little Mix, but has also been to Caf\u00e9 Mambo in Ibiza with her dad and appreciates he has a cool job. Woody, 18, \u201cis too cool to admit my music might be cool. He\u2019s into drum\u2019n\u2019bass.\u201d I ask if he\u2019s discussed alcohol and drugs with them, but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about that. Now, instead of loathing himself, Cook can loathe golf instead. \u201cEvery moment I\u2019m not playing golf is to be cherished.\u201d Does he play? \u201cNo.\u201d Will he ever? \u201cHopefully not.\u201d Golf equals death. When we meet in the breakfast room of a posh London hotel, Cook looks youthful and healthy. He\u2019s wearing a bright short-sleeved shirt, like a man permanently on holiday. Mornings are easier \u2013 and longer \u2013 than they were before, 10 years ago. Now Cook is branching out from DJing and producing, trying to get respectable jobs on the side, like the film Ibiza: The Silent Movie, a collaboration with director Julien Temple. Temple is due to join us for breakfast but he\u2019s stuck in traffic on a diverted bus. The film is a history of the mythical Mediterranean island \u2013 not just the past 30 years, Cook\u2019s era, but 2,000 years. Before the ravers there were Phoenicians and Moors, Romans, dada poets, beatniks, draft dodgers, fascists. It wasn\u2019t always all smiley faces and euphoria, and if someone had their hands in the air it might have been because they didn\u2019t want to get shot. Twenty-one Ibizan priests weren\u2019t smiling when they were executed during the Spanish civil war; nor Raoul Villain, the French nationalist who died slowly on the beach in 1936; nor this pig being slaughtered and butchered. There is blood in Ibiza\u2019s ochre soil \u2013 though actually probably not from the pig. This is La Matanza, the traditional Spanish way to slaughter a pig, with hardly any waste; everything is chopped up and used. Temple has chopped up the history, mixing ancient legends with modern mythology, the vandalism of Romans with vandalism by 1980s holiday developers, dadaists grooving out to jazz in an old windmill with the ecstasy fuelled masses at Ku, Pasha and Amnesia. It\u2019s witty and playful.

      "body": "<p>A German court has ruled against a claim by the great-great-grandson of the country\u2019s last kaiser to the picturesque ruins of a 13th-century castle overlooking the Rhine valley.</p> <p>Georg Friedrich Prince of Prussia argued the ruins of Rheinfels Castle should be returned to the Hohenzollern family because the current owners had breached a century-old agreement, a claim rejected on Tuesday by a court in Koblenz.</p> <p>Georg Friedrich is the great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was deposed in the German revolution of 1918 at the end of the first world war. While he is allowed to use the term \u201cPrince\u201d, it is considered to be part of his surname, not a title.</p> <p>The 43-year-old had wanted to claim back Rheinfels Castle, the largest of the ruins overlooking the Loreley valley, a 42-mile (67km) section of the Rhine, a Unesco world heritage site that has inspired countless Romantic poems and fairytales.<br><br>The castle, which dates back to 1245 and is known for its labyrinthine network of tunnels and trenches, belonged to the former ruling Hohenzollern dynasty from the 19th century. In 1924, after the fall of the kaiser, the ruin was handed over to the nearby town of St Goar, on the condition that it not be sold.</p> <p>But in 1998, the town agreed to a 99-year leasehold with a four-star luxury hotel overlooking the ruin, with the option of an equally long extension. In his claim against the town, hotel, and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Georg Friedrich argued that this amounted to a sale, thus voiding the town\u2019s claim to ownership.</p> <p>He argued the site should be returned to the Hohenzollern dynasty. However, the Koblenz court dismissed the case, saying that even if the agreement had been breached, the Hohenzollerns would not have a legal right to reclaim the property.</p> <p>The defence for the state said Georg Friedrich had known about the deal with the hotel and was only now trying to profit from it. He owns two-thirds of the family\u2019s original seat, the Gothic Hohenzollern Castle in Swabia.</p> <p>Town and state are in talks over a multimillion-euro renovation of the castle ruins, work which had been postponed due to the legal battle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A German court has ruled against a claim by the great-great-grandson of the country\u2019s last kaiser to the picturesque ruins of a 13th-century castle overlooking the Rhine valley. Georg Friedrich Prince of Prussia argued the ruins of Rheinfels Castle should be returned to the Hohenzollern family because the current owners had breached a century-old agreement, a claim rejected on Tuesday by a court in Koblenz. Georg Friedrich is the great-great-grandson of Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was deposed in the German revolution of 1918 at the end of the first world war. While he is allowed to use the term \u201cPrince\u201d, it is considered to be part of his surname, not a title. The 43-year-old had wanted to claim back Rheinfels Castle, the largest of the ruins overlooking the Loreley valley, a 42-mile (67km) section of the Rhine, a Unesco world heritage site that has inspired countless Romantic poems and fairytales. The castle, which dates back to 1245 and is known for its labyrinthine network of tunnels and trenches, belonged to the former ruling Hohenzollern dynasty from the 19th century. In 1924, after the fall of the kaiser, the ruin was handed over to the nearby town of St Goar, on the condition that it not be sold. But in 1998, the town agreed to a 99-year leasehold with a four-star luxury hotel overlooking the ruin, with the option of an equally long extension. In his claim against the town, hotel, and the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, Georg Friedrich argued that this amounted to a sale, thus voiding the town\u2019s claim to ownership. He argued the site should be returned to the Hohenzollern dynasty. However, the Koblenz court dismissed the case, saying that even if the agreement had been breached, the Hohenzollerns would not have a legal right to reclaim the property. The defence for the state said Georg Friedrich had known about the deal with the hotel and was only now trying to profit from it. He owns two-thirds of the family\u2019s original seat, the Gothic Hohenzollern Castle in Swabia. Town and state are in talks over a multimillion-euro renovation of the castle ruins, work which had been postponed due to the legal battle.",

Just for once.</p> <p>So there are the TV interviews with networks other than Fox News, including <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/id-exclusive-interview-trump-listen-foreigners-offered-dirt/story?id=63669304\">the one</a> with ABC News where he was supposed to look normal but ended up saying he\u2019d accept more Russian dirt in the upcoming election. If only to see if it was any good. Totally presidential.</p> <p>There was the decisive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/21/united-airlines-halts-some-flights-mumbai-to-avoid-iran-after-drone-attack\">moment</a> when he turned the jets around as they were about to bomb Iran: an act of leadership that overruled his hawkish aides, as well as his earlier decision to, um, bomb Iran. Totally commander-in-chief.</p> <p>And then there was the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/06/23/trump-brushes-off-calls-investigate-jamal-khashoggis-death/?utm_term=.a78683c83510\">interview</a> with NBC News, where he readily admitted that he puts a higher value on arms deals with Saudi Arabia than on American values like democracy and human rights. Totally making America great again.</p> <p>Pressed by NBC, Trump made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less about the bone saw-wielding murderers who dismembered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly on the orders of the Saudi crown prince himself. He also couldn\u2019t care about the UN\u2019s recommendations that the FBI investigate the murder of Khashoggi, who was a US resident and wrote for the Washington Post.</p> <p>Unable to muster any human feeling, Trump couldn\u2019t muster any rational answers either. \u201cI think it\u2019s been heavily investigated,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/06/23/president_trump_full_interview_with_meet_the_press.html\">said</a>. When asked who had done all that heavy investigating, he blurted out: \u201cBy everybody \u2026 I\u2019ve seen so many different reports.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is just one other country that elicits such a bizarrely determined and loyal attachment from Donald Trump: Russia</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Seeing is normally believing, but in Trump\u2019s case that might not be true. \u201cHere\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said, warming to the subject of international relations. \u201cYou ready?\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not at all clear if the world is ready for this kind of train of thought, even after all these many years of blather. You see, according to Trump there are other countries that do bad things, like Iran. And they do so many bad things that Iran is totally worth investigating.</p> <p>This kind of argument somewhat undermines the presidential moment that averted war with Iran, but let\u2019s not set our standards too high. Because there was more of this brain fart to follow.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not like a fool that says, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do business with them.\u2019 And by the way, if they don\u2019t do business with us, you know what they do? They\u2019ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese. They will buy \u2013 we make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China,\u201d he told Chuck Todd of NBC News.</p> <p>\u201cChuck, take their money. Take their money, Chuck.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has already said that his re-election slogan is \u201cKeep America Great,\u201d as if the next four years will be a desperate exercise in clinging on to what he thinks he\u2019s achieved, such as avoiding impeachment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"559712c983a5b25e0c509c6979b9eb32e6045d4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/559712c983a5b25e0c509c6979b9eb32e6045d4b/0_92_2515_1509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mohammad bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Moraes/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a shame because \u201cTake Their Money\u201d is a far more authentic one-liner about this president. At least it suggests that the Trump project is an ongoing enterprise.</p> <p>To be fair, the Trump administration is hardly the first to overlook every human rights abuse by the Saudi regime in the single-minded pursuit of oil, money and power. Previous presidents and prime ministers were also surprisingly capable of ignoring the kingdom\u2019s oppression of women and its love of state-sanctioned death by beheading.</p> <p>In fact, the Saudis <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-execution-un/u-n-rights-boss-condemns-saudi-arabias-beheading-of-37-men-idUSKCN1S01CA\">decapitated</a> 37 men just a few weeks ago, most of them minority Shia Muslims who were denied a fair trial. Some of them were children at the time of their sentencing. None of them were Washington Post journalists, and the killings received far less attention.</p> <p>Perhaps we care more about beheadings after Isis. Perhaps we think the Saudis should live up to the so-called reform agenda of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Perhaps the bonesaw was just too horrific to ignore.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, Trump\u2019s desire to sell arms to the Saudis flies in the face of his own Republicans, as well as all the Democrats who already consider his foreign policy about as credible and responsible as the Saudi reforms.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/22/age-of-the-shameless-lie-moscow-riyadh-washington\">In Moscow, Riyadh and Washington, this is the age of the shameless lie</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just last week Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to vote repeatedly to block US arms sales to the Saudis and the Gulf states, while the Trumpistas tried to run around Congress by declaring an emergency over Iran. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Congress voted to cut off US support for the brutal Saudi-backed war in Yemen.</p> <p>Trump vetoed Congress before and will surely do so again. All the chest-beating about Iran, as well as all the backtracking on military strikes, needs to be seen in this context about Trump\u2019s curious love affair with the Saudis.</p> <p>It\u2019s a romance that has left even the few close friends of Donald Trump in a position of downright opposition, including the otherwise sycophantic Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \u201cThere is no amount of oil you can produce that will get me and others to give you a pass on chopping somebody up in a consulate,\u201d Graham <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/20/us/politics/saudi-arms-sales.html\">said</a>, after leading the legislation against the arms sales to the Saudis.</p> <p>There is just one other country that elicits such a bizarrely determined and loyal attachment from Donald Trump: Russia. That foreign entanglement also causes head-scratching rifts with his own toadying Republicans. But nobody should find Trump\u2019s attitudes to Russia and Saudi Arabia hard to understand.</p> <p>We might not have his tax returns, but we do have Trump\u2019s succinct summary of his motives: take the money, Chuck.</p> <ul> <li><p>Richard Wolffe is a columnist for the Guardian US</p></li> </ul>",

With a re-election year kicking off, everyone wants to know if the candidate can fill in the gaping holes in his record, to give voters some reason to hope or believe. In the case of Donald Trump, that means trying to look like something he hasn\u2019t been for the last two and a half years: presidential, sane and worthy of the world\u2019s respect. Just for once. So there are the TV interviews with networks other than Fox News, including the one with ABC News where he was supposed to look normal but ended up saying he\u2019d accept more Russian dirt in the upcoming election. If only to see if it was any good. Totally presidential. There was the decisive moment when he turned the jets around as they were about to bomb Iran: an act of leadership that overruled his hawkish aides, as well as his earlier decision to, um, bomb Iran. Totally commander-in-chief. And then there was the interview with NBC News, where he readily admitted that he puts a higher value on arms deals with Saudi Arabia than on American values like democracy and human rights. Totally making America great again. Pressed by NBC, Trump made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less about the bone saw-wielding murderers who dismembered journalist Jamal Khashoggi, allegedly on the orders of the Saudi crown prince himself. He also couldn\u2019t care about the UN\u2019s recommendations that the FBI investigate the murder of Khashoggi, who was a US resident and wrote for the Washington Post. Unable to muster any human feeling, Trump couldn\u2019t muster any rational answers either. \u201cI think it\u2019s been heavily investigated,\u201d Trump said. When asked who had done all that heavy investigating, he blurted out: \u201cBy everybody \u2026 I\u2019ve seen so many different reports.\u201d Seeing is normally believing, but in Trump\u2019s case that might not be true. \u201cHere\u2019s where I am,\u201d he said, warming to the subject of international relations. \u201cYou ready?\u201d It\u2019s not at all clear if the world is ready for this kind of train of thought, even after all these many years of blather. You see, according to Trump there are other countries that do bad things, like Iran. And they do so many bad things that Iran is totally worth investigating. This kind of argument somewhat undermines the presidential moment that averted war with Iran, but let\u2019s not set our standards too high. Because there was more of this brain fart to follow. \u201cI\u2019m not like a fool that says, \u2018We don\u2019t want to do business with them.\u2019 And by the way, if they don\u2019t do business with us, you know what they do? They\u2019ll do business with the Russians or with the Chinese. They will buy \u2013 we make the best equipment in the world, but they will buy great equipment from Russia and from China,\u201d he told Chuck Todd of NBC News. \u201cChuck, take their money. Take their money, Chuck.\u201d Trump has already said that his re-election slogan is \u201cKeep America Great,\u201d as if the next four years will be a desperate exercise in clinging on to what he thinks he\u2019s achieved, such as avoiding impeachment. This is a shame because \u201cTake Their Money\u201d is a far more authentic one-liner about this president. At least it suggests that the Trump project is an ongoing enterprise. To be fair, the Trump administration is hardly the first to overlook every human rights abuse by the Saudi regime in the single-minded pursuit of oil, money and power. Previous presidents and prime ministers were also surprisingly capable of ignoring the kingdom\u2019s oppression of women and its love of state-sanctioned death by beheading. In fact, the Saudis decapitated 37 men just a few weeks ago, most of them minority Shia Muslims who were denied a fair trial. Some of them were children at the time of their sentencing. None of them were Washington Post journalists, and the killings received far less attention. Perhaps we care more about beheadings after Isis. Perhaps we think the Saudis should live up to the so-called reform agenda of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Perhaps the bonesaw was just too horrific to ignore. Whatever the reason, Trump\u2019s desire to sell arms to the Saudis flies in the face of his own Republicans, as well as all the Democrats who already consider his foreign policy about as credible and responsible as the Saudi reforms. Just last week Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to vote repeatedly to block US arms sales to the Saudis and the Gulf states, while the Trumpistas tried to run around Congress by declaring an emergency over Iran. It wasn\u2019t that long ago that Congress voted to cut off US support for the brutal Saudi-backed war in Yemen. Trump vetoed Congress before and will surely do so again. All the chest-beating about Iran, as well as all the backtracking on military strikes, needs to be seen in this context about Trump\u2019s curious love affair with the Saudis. It\u2019s a romance that has left even the few close friends of Donald Trump in a position of downright opposition, including the otherwise sycophantic Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. \u201cThere is no amount of oil you can produce that will get me and others to give you a pass on chopping somebody up in a consulate,\u201d Graham said, after leading the legislation against the arms sales to the Saudis. There is just one other country that elicits such a bizarrely determined and loyal attachment from Donald Trump: Russia. That foreign entanglement also causes head-scratching rifts with his own toadying Republicans. But nobody should find Trump\u2019s attitudes to Russia and Saudi Arabia hard to understand. We might not have his tax returns, but we do have Trump\u2019s succinct summary of his motives: take the money, Chuck. Richard Wolffe is a columnist for the Guardian US",

In places two lanes of motor traffic have been reduced to one, adding an extra bus lane, but cycling here remains unpleasant: \u201cadvisory\u201d cycle lanes stop and start, used by loading vehicles, crossed by buses and disappearing to leave people on bikes in part-time bus lanes with general traffic. With a pedestrian boardwalk added to the riverside, councillors have finally agreed on a redesign \u2013 but it will be another two years before work on that starts. Brendan O\u2019Brien, who is in charge of transport in the city, says he is \u201cas frustrated as anyone\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s actually only really this year that we have seen any significant funding allocated for cycling,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat we have been able to do \u2026 is not as much as anybody would have hoped.\u201d It\u2019s not just for lack of funds. In 2016, Smyth, then a councillor, proposed a \u201cquietway\u201d to link neighbourhoods and schools in Rathmines, south Dublin. Frustrated by delays, Smyth began organising public meetings to push the plan, but misinformation quickly spread. \u201cThere was propaganda going around saying I wanted to put a cycle superhighway with Lycra-clad Mamils [middle-aged men in Lycra] coming down the street,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was a route designed for three-year-olds on tricycles, mothers with buggies, cyclists of any age wanting to get back on bikes for the first time in 10, 20, 30 years. That public meeting was the closest thing to a lynch mob I have ever been in front of. People were genuinely afraid to speak up, because of the vitriol.\u201d The proposals never even made it to consultation. Under pressure But there is growing pressure to act. Dublin\u2019s economy is booming and recent EU elections increased the number of green councillors in the city from three to 10. \u201cBeing seen with a bike has become the new kissing babies,\u201d Ferrie says. The Green party has a plan setting out a new focus on sustainable transport. Although proposals to make public transport free have not been successful, the pedestrianisation of College Green remains on the table. There\u2019s also pressure from the multinational tech companies that have made Dublin their European base \u2013 among them Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Groupon and Twitter. Google is among a number of businesses that have signed up to a campaign calling for the 2013 cycle network plan to be funded. O\u2019Brien says plans to increase the size of the city\u2019s cycling team will \u201cbeef up\u201d engagement and reduce the time to get schemes up and running. There is an extra \u20ac1.7m funding for a greenway, and Dublin Cycling Campaign estimates the city will this year spend \u20ac30m on cycling \u2013 about 2% of the total transport budget. The council is also ramping up enforcement of bike lanes, and tripling the number of tow trucks with a specific target to keep bus and bike lanes clear. The problem is many cycle lanes, with dotted lines, are \u201cadvisory\u201d, meaning drivers can legally park for 30 minutes to load \u2013 a rule O\u2019Brien says \u201cclouds the issue\u201d. He says the city is looking to convert as many bike lanes as possible to \u201cmandatory operation\u201d, with solid white lines so parking is banned at all times. Copenhagen\u2019s former \u201cbicycle mayor\u201d Klaus Bondam said ahead of this week\u2019s conference that becoming a cycling city by 2030 is within Dublin\u2019s grasp, but it will take \u201cpolitical courage, consistency and significant investment\u201d to reallocating road space from cars to bikes. Whether Dublin will deliver remains to be seen. Speaking at the opening of the Velo-City conference, the chief executive of Dublin council, Owen Keegan, admitted his city had not done enough to protect cyclists and promote sustainable transport, but said he hoped investment was coming. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our way with the private car over the last 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope we find our way back.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

We were an established Premier League club then, challenging at the right end of the table. Without a manager such as Ben\u00edtez, we run the risk of going and never coming back.</p> <p>Already, odds have been massively shortened for the club to go down which, and when you look at some of the names being mentioned as Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor in the media, such as Avram Grant and Michael Appleton \u2013 yes, you are reading that correctly \u2013 it is unsurprising.</p> <p>That Ben\u00edtez, who embodied the undying spirit and resilience of the club, has been allowed to leave sends the clearest message yet that this regime has been, and will continue to be, guided by unscrupulous avarice and self-serving pig-headedness. It sends a message to the hundreds of thousands of doting supporters whose hard-earned money has been spent on following their team up and down the country, across Europe and further afield, that they simply do not care. At best, they are downright ignorant as to what is in front of them.</p> <p>Barring a journey across the Tyne and a few miles south to Sunderland, whatever Ben\u00edtez chooses to do next, he will have the full support of Newcastle fans. I would like to think few would fault him for his departure \u2013 a dignified refusal to play the puppet Ashley wanted of him \u2013 and he will for ever, regretfully, be remembered as the one that got away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>If there were to be one silver lining in the thick dark clouds that have hung over Newcastle United over the past 12 years, it is that the man who oversaw these evidently catastrophic renewal talks with Ben\u00edtez may well be following him out of the door soon enough. Ashley supposedly remains in talks with several potential purchasers, including the Dubai-based billionaire Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates.</p> <p>That said, the club arguably derived so much of its present value \u2013 what Ashley deems to be \u00a3350m \u2013 from its manager and what he represented; he was the pride of the club, upon whom our survival in the Premier League has been reliant, and upon whom our imagined future rested. With Ben\u00edtez gone, it\u2019s plausible the investors\u2019 interest will drop off.</p> <p>And in the wings, the fans will be left, as they often have been under this regime, with a sense of nothingness.

However, Ben\u00edtez\u2019s departure is conceivably the worst thing that has happened here, supplanting Robson\u2019s sacking and both of Keegan\u2019s resignations. We were an established Premier League club then, challenging at the right end of the table. Without a manager such as Ben\u00edtez, we run the risk of going and never coming back. Already, odds have been massively shortened for the club to go down which, and when you look at some of the names being mentioned as Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor in the media, such as Avram Grant and Michael Appleton \u2013 yes, you are reading that correctly \u2013 it is unsurprising. That Ben\u00edtez, who embodied the undying spirit and resilience of the club, has been allowed to leave sends the clearest message yet that this regime has been, and will continue to be, guided by unscrupulous avarice and self-serving pig-headedness. It sends a message to the hundreds of thousands of doting supporters whose hard-earned money has been spent on following their team up and down the country, across Europe and further afield, that they simply do not care. At best, they are downright ignorant as to what is in front of them. Barring a journey across the Tyne and a few miles south to Sunderland, whatever Ben\u00edtez chooses to do next, he will have the full support of Newcastle fans. I would like to think few would fault him for his departure \u2013 a dignified refusal to play the puppet Ashley wanted of him \u2013 and he will for ever, regretfully, be remembered as the one that got away. If there were to be one silver lining in the thick dark clouds that have hung over Newcastle United over the past 12 years, it is that the man who oversaw these evidently catastrophic renewal talks with Ben\u00edtez may well be following him out of the door soon enough. Ashley supposedly remains in talks with several potential purchasers, including the Dubai-based billionaire Sheikh Khaled bin Zayed al-Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates. That said, the club arguably derived so much of its present value \u2013 what Ashley deems to be \u00a3350m \u2013 from its manager and what he represented; he was the pride of the club, upon whom our survival in the Premier League has been reliant, and upon whom our imagined future rested. With Ben\u00edtez gone, it\u2019s plausible the investors\u2019 interest will drop off. And in the wings, the fans will be left, as they often have been under this regime, with a sense of nothingness. Pre-season starts in 10 days: no manager, no signings, no hope. \u2022 @HAJSavill is editor of The Spectator\u2019s View",

Some supporters of a no-deal Brexit have claimed that the UK can use Gatt XXIV to implement a period of up to 10 years where trade between the UK and EU continues under existing arrangements while a comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) is negotiated.<br></p>\n    <p>Under the WTO\u2019s most-favoured nation rule (MFN), if the UK offered tariff-free access to the UK market to the EU, it would also have to do so to any other trading partner with which there was not an already established FTA. With Gatt XXIV, Brexiters say, the UK can maintain its existing zero tariffs and quotas EU access as part of a \u2018standstill\u2019 arrangement.<br></p>\n    <p>However to invoke Gatt XXIV, both the UK and the EU have to agree an \u2018interim arrangement\u2019 leading towards a FTA within the 10-year time limit - and that agreement has to meet the conditions and approval of the WTO. The UK cannot invoke article 24 unilaterally, and even if it could, it only applies to goods, and not to services.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has repeatedly refused to say whether his campaign team passed a photograph of him and his partner to newspapers as a PR strategy during a radio interview which saw the Tory leadership frontrunner quizzed again about his personal life. Speaking to LBC, Johnson refused at least half a dozen times to comment on the photo of himself and Carrie Symonds seemingly sitting in the garden of a pub. He would not answer when the host, Nick Ferrari, pressed: \u201cThis is quite an old picture isn\u2019t it?\u201d Johnson also argued that the country should be \u201cmore positive\u201d on the prospects of a good Brexit outcome, and seemingly roll back on his plan to focus tax cuts on high earners. The pictures appeared in selected newspapers on Monday, and were reprinted on several front pages on Tuesday, without any details of where and when they were taken, or by whom. The presumption was they were put out by Johnson\u2019s team as a PR move in the wake of a damaging weekend of headlines. Police were called to the London home he shares with Symonds in the early hours of Friday after neighbours heard a furious row \u2013 an event Johnson has repeatedly refused to comment on. Quizzed by Ferrari, Johnson said he understood why the event had prompted media interest. \u201cYes, of course, and I readily accept that and understand that. Newspapers and other media outlets, of course, are going to want to print and to speculate what they choose,\u201d he said. Insisting again he would not disclose details about those close to him, Johnson refused repeatedly to say how or why the photos of him and Symonds had reached the press, trying numerous times to change the subject. \u201cNewspapers will print whatever they are going to print,\u201d he said. \u201cThe longer we spend on things extraneous to what I want to do, the bigger the waste of time.\u201d Pressed by Ferrari, he said: \u201cThere are all sorts of pictures of me on the internet, which pop up from time to time.\u201d Asked if he knew the picture was coming out, he said: \u201cI am aware of all sorts of pictures of me out on the internet, and it is entirely up to newspapers to decide what they want to print.\u201d Johnson also declined to say where and when the photo was taken, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s not a state secret; it just happens to be something that I don\u2019t want to give to you.\u201d Asked why his hair seemed longer in the photo than it is currently, he said: \u201cThis is beyond satire.\u201d On the substance of his Brexit plans, Johnson dismissed the idea he could be hampered by Tory rebels, saying the party was \u201cstaring down the barrel of defeat\u201d if it did not deliver a departure plan, which would focus minds. Johnson said he would \u201cdisaggregate the elements of the current withdrawal agreement \u2013 you need to take the serviceable bits\u201d to seek a new arrangement with the EU, and prepare for possible no deal as \u201cthe other leg of the proposal\u201d. He insisted no deal would not cause a hard border in Northern Ireland, but gave no details on how this would be avoided beyond the general idea of so-called maximum facilitation checks using technology, which would not be ready for several years. Johnson also argued against the view of the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, that the UK would be hit automatically by tariffs on exports to the EU in a no-deal Brexit, arguing the country could rely on article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade (Gatt). \u201cHe\u2019s wrong in thinking that it\u2019s not an option. It\u2019s certainly an option,\u201d Johnson said, adding: \u201cLet\u2019s be more positive about this. It\u2019s time this country stopped being so down about it\u2019s ability to get this done.\u201d Responding to listeners\u2019 calls, Johnson defended his tenure as London mayor, and as foreign secretary, repeating his contentious claim that a gaffe he had made about the status of the jailed British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had made no difference to her plight. On tax, Johnson dismissed an analysis that his plan to raise the earnings threshold for the higher 40p rate of tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000 would most benefit the richest 10% of households, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t recognise those figures.\u201d Johnson indicated any future tax policy would be more broad, saying: \u201cWe will bring forwards a tax proposal that actually begins by lifting thresholds for those on lowest pay.\u201d In response to another question, he dismissed the idea of links to Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s controversial former campaign manager, as \u201cthe biggest load of codswallop I have ever heard\u201d. Video footage of Bannon has emerged in which he discusses having had regular consultations with Johnson last year. Johnson said: \u201cIt is perfectly true that when the president came to this country last year, Steve Bannon texted me on a couple of occasions, trying to fix a meeting. I texted back to say it was not possible.\u201d",

The document, the result of two years\u2019 work by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, has already been subject to a torrent of undiplomatic abuse. Palestinians have made clear that they will not attend Manama \u2013 apart from the odd businessman prepared to defy a broad national consensus that unusually unites Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nor does the word 'occupation' appear anywhere [in the US deal], except with reference to 'occupational mobility'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s hostility to the Palestinians and blatant bias towards Israel have been clear from the moment he entered the Oval Office: the transfer of the US embassy to Jerusalem, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/trump-to-cut-all-us-funding-for-uns-main-palestinian-refugee-programme\" title=\"\">slashing of aid</a> to UNRWA (the agency that assists Palestinian refugees), the closure of the PLO mission in Washington and recognition of Israel\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/jun/17/trump-heights-israel-names-golan-heights-settlement-after-us-president-video\" title=\"\">annexation</a> of the Syrian Golan Heights have all been bleak and damaging landmarks. The president\u2019s disruptive moves have undermined the longstanding international consensus that the only way to resolve the world\u2019s most intractable conflict is to create a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel \u2013 thus finally granting equal rights to both peoples who are doomed, whether they like it or not, to share the Holy Land.</p> <p>The infinitely more difficult political part of Trump\u2019s characteristically named \u201cultimate deal\u201d has yet to be published. With another election looming in Israel in October (after April\u2019s poll failed to produce a new government) it faces further delay and may not see the light of day before the 2020 US election. But the economic element laid out in the Peace to Prosperity document presents a surreal, even fantastic vision. Its headline figure of investing $50bn (\u00a339bn) in the infrastructure of the West Bank and Gaza (as well as Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon) is contained in a slick but superficial brochure that might be advertising a real estate deal to private equity firms.</p> <p>Property rights are mentioned, but there is no reference whatsoever to the illegal Israeli settlements scattered across the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel appears a few times but only in a list of neighbouring countries. Palestine \u2013 as opposed to Palestinians \u2013 is not mentioned either. Nor does the word \u201coccupation\u201d appear anywhere, except with reference to \u201coccupational mobility\u201d \u2013 hampered on the ground by endless Israeli checkpoints.</p> <p>Illustrations show recipients of previous US aid that has been axed by Trump, including the <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/.premium-we-bereaved-israeli-and-palestinian-parents-will-not-be-pawns-in-kushner-s-peace-pla-1.7403645\" title=\"\">Bereaved Families Forum</a>, an organisation working for reconciliation between Israeli and Palestinian victims of violence. Previous efforts to sell a vision of economic peace, by the past Quartet envoy Tony Blair or John Kerry, US secretary of state under Barack Obama, have failed \u2013 and are ignored. Dubai and Singapore are nevertheless cited as exemplary regional hubs.</p> <p>The understandable fear on the Palestinian side is that this rights-free approach is a precursor to Israeli moves to annex parts of the West Bank, with that likelihood signalled on the eve of the last election by Benjamin Netanyahu and echoed by David Friedman, the controversial US ambassador to Israel who has worked closely with Kushner.</p> <p>\u201cPalestine,\u201d as one senior PLO official quipped, \u201chas a CEO called Mahmoud Abbas, and Trump wants to break his back. And, yes, we may have lost the Americans but we have kept everyone else.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/jared-kushner-middle-east-peace-white-house\">Kushner unveils economic part of 'deal of the century' Middle East peace plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unlike the Palestinians, representatives of Arab states will be in Manama \u2013 though at a low level and only after apparently insisting that Israeli officials (as opposed to businessmen) would not be invited. The Saudis, Emiratis, Qatar and Kuwait will be there, as will Egypt and Jordan, feeling that given their dependence on the US, especially as tensions soar over Iran, they had little choice. Bahrain, after all, is home to the US Fifth Fleet. \u201cWhat alternative did we have?\u201d shrugged one regional diplomat. But that is still a far cry from the fantasy peddled by Netanyahu and apparently believed by Kushner and Trump, that the Gulf states \u2013 still sensitive to popular sentiment despite their autocratic nature \u2013 would openly abandon the Palestinian cause.</p> <p>Kushner himself said in an interview that \u201cthe current status quo is not a sustainable situation\u201d. That is certainly correct. But otherwise his plan \u2013 money for peace replacing land for peace \u2013 is bizarre nonsense and as such has been widely and rightly rejected. Boycotting Bahrain is not another missed opportunity by the Palestinians, but instead signals a rare, determined and united effort to insist that their economic needs \u2013 real and urgent \u2013 do not trump their fundamental rights.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Black is a former Middle East editor of the Guardian</p>",

Palestinians have made clear that they will not attend Manama \u2013 apart from the odd businessman prepared to defy a broad national consensus that unusually unites Mahmoud Abbas\u2019s Palestinian Authority in Ramallah and the Hamas rulers of the Gaza Strip. Trump\u2019s hostility to the Palestinians and blatant bias towards Israel have been clear from the moment he entered the Oval Office: the transfer of the US embassy to Jerusalem, the slashing of aid to UNRWA (the agency that assists Palestinian refugees), the closure of the PLO mission in Washington and recognition of Israel\u2019s annexation of the Syrian Golan Heights have all been bleak and damaging landmarks. The president\u2019s disruptive moves have undermined the longstanding international consensus that the only way to resolve the world\u2019s most intractable conflict is to create a viable Palestinian state alongside Israel \u2013 thus finally granting equal rights to both peoples who are doomed, whether they like it or not, to share the Holy Land. The infinitely more difficult political part of Trump\u2019s characteristically named \u201cultimate deal\u201d has yet to be published. With another election looming in Israel in October (after April\u2019s poll failed to produce a new government) it faces further delay and may not see the light of day before the 2020 US election. But the economic element laid out in the Peace to Prosperity document presents a surreal, even fantastic vision. Its headline figure of investing $50bn (\u00a339bn) in the infrastructure of the West Bank and Gaza (as well as Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon) is contained in a slick but superficial brochure that might be advertising a real estate deal to private equity firms. Property rights are mentioned, but there is no reference whatsoever to the illegal Israeli settlements scattered across the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel appears a few times but only in a list of neighbouring countries. Palestine \u2013 as opposed to Palestinians \u2013 is not mentioned either. Nor does the word \u201coccupation\u201d appear anywhere, except with reference to \u201coccupational mobility\u201d \u2013 hampered on the ground by endless Israeli checkpoints. Illustrations show recipients of previous US aid that has been axed by Trump, including the Bereaved Families Forum, an organisation working for reconciliation between Israeli and Palestinian victims of violence. Previous efforts to sell a vision of economic peace, by the past Quartet envoy Tony Blair or John Kerry, US secretary of state under Barack Obama, have failed \u2013 and are ignored. Dubai and Singapore are nevertheless cited as exemplary regional hubs. The understandable fear on the Palestinian side is that this rights-free approach is a precursor to Israeli moves to annex parts of the West Bank, with that likelihood signalled on the eve of the last election by Benjamin Netanyahu and echoed by David Friedman, the controversial US ambassador to Israel who has worked closely with Kushner. \u201cPalestine,\u201d as one senior PLO official quipped, \u201chas a CEO called Mahmoud Abbas, and Trump wants to break his back. And, yes, we may have lost the Americans but we have kept everyone else.\u201d Unlike the Palestinians, representatives of Arab states will be in Manama \u2013 though at a low level and only after apparently insisting that Israeli officials (as opposed to businessmen) would not be invited. The Saudis, Emiratis, Qatar and Kuwait will be there, as will Egypt and Jordan, feeling that given their dependence on the US, especially as tensions soar over Iran, they had little choice. Bahrain, after all, is home to the US Fifth Fleet. \u201cWhat alternative did we have?\u201d shrugged one regional diplomat. But that is still a far cry from the fantasy peddled by Netanyahu and apparently believed by Kushner and Trump, that the Gulf states \u2013 still sensitive to popular sentiment despite their autocratic nature \u2013 would openly abandon the Palestinian cause. Kushner himself said in an interview that \u201cthe current status quo is not a sustainable situation\u201d. That is certainly correct. But otherwise his plan \u2013 money for peace replacing land for peace \u2013 is bizarre nonsense and as such has been widely and rightly rejected. Boycotting Bahrain is not another missed opportunity by the Palestinians, but instead signals a rare, determined and united effort to insist that their economic needs \u2013 real and urgent \u2013 do not trump their fundamental rights. \u2022 Ian Black is a former Middle East editor of the Guardian",

His second marriage, to Christine Booker (nee Verity), came in 1982. They had a son, and she died in 2016.</p> <p>As a teacher Stone could be inspiring, often winning over his pupils with his charm, which on occasion could be quite considerable, but he became increasingly undisciplined, neglecting his duties, and spending increasing amounts of time playing poker and drinking himself into oblivion in Soho.</p> <p>The Cambridge University history faculty became impatient with his behaviour, but solved the problem of how to deal with him by encouraging him to apply for the professorship of modern history at Oxford, to which he was appointed in 1985 thanks largely to political support from rightwing Oxford dons reinforced by a laudatory reference from <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-professor-sir-geoffrey-elton-1390129.html\" title=\"\">Sir Geoffrey Elton</a>, the regius professor at Cambridge.</p> <p>Stone hated Oxford, which he thought (bizarrely) was full of Marxists and out of touch with the real world. He lambasted the university on a regular basis in his newspaper column while continuing to draw his salary (a sum he frequently dismissed as too miserly to keep him in the style to which he had become accustomed), and excoriating it for refusing an honorary degree to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies\" title=\"\">Margaret Thatcher</a> because of the cuts she had imposed on universities (\u201cWhy should we feed the hand that bites us?\u201d one don memorably asked).</p> <p>On the occasions when he did appear in Oxford to do some teaching, Stone became notorious for groping his female students (one of whom is said to have responded with a slap across the face), and annoyed Worcester College by sub-letting his rooms to make a bit of extra money. In 1997 the university finally grasped the nettle and arranged for his departure, though under financial terms that forced it to delay filling his chair until 2006, the year when he would have reached the statutory age of retirement.</p> <p>Long before this, he had espoused a variety of rightwing political causes, advocating Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, defending the Chilean dictator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/dec/11/chile.pinochet4\" title=\"\">Augusto Pinochet</a> and supporting Croatia in the Balkan wars. He did some speechwriting for Thatcher and advised her on foreign policy, though she did not listen to his assurances that the reunification of Germany in 1990 was not a danger to European peace. On one occasion he collapsed in front of her, drunk; but she was well known for her indulgence towards alcoholics so long as they supported her politically.</p> <p>After Oxford, he found a berth in Turkey, where he occupied positions at Bilkent and other universities, resigning from one in Ankara because the authorities tried to stop him drinking.</p> <p>He devoted some of his remaining energies to the denial of the genocide of Armenians by Turkey in the first world war, but they were fading rapidly, and his last books \u2013 short histories of the two world wars (2007 and 2013) and The Atlantic and Its Enemies: A Personal History of the Cold War (2010) \u2013 did no justice to his real abilities, mixing worn-out historical clich\u00e9s with random statements of his own personal views. </p> <p>His last post was at the Danube Institute, Budapest, and his last book, Hungary: A Short History (2018) praised the country\u2019s authoritarian leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/viktor-orban\" title=\"\">Viktor Orb\u00e1n</a> among other things for his tough line on immigration.</p> <p>Knowing that he did little research, never bothered to check his facts and relied on his literary flair to mask his mistakes, the publishers got serious historians to go through the text: one of them sent in a 20-page list of errors, but it was impossible to spot them all and so it was left to reviewers to point out the many further inaccuracies.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with historians being provocative so long as their provocations stimulate one to think again about the subjects they deal with. <a href=\"http://www.niallferguson.com/\" title=\"\">Niall Ferguson</a> on the right would be one good example of fruitful provocation, just as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/09/biography.history\" title=\"\">AJP Taylor</a> was on the left. But Stone\u2019s provocations were little more than the voicing of his own personal political prejudices, and so had little or no effect on the way we think about the past.</p> <p>Journalists often described him as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s leading historians\u201d, but in truth he was nothing of the kind, as any serious member of the profession will tell you. The former prime minister, Heath, was wrong about many things, but he was surely right when he said of Stone during his time in Oxford: \u201cMany parents of Oxford students must be both horrified and disgusted that the higher education of our children should rest in the hands of such a man.\u201d</p> <p>Stone is survived by his sons.</p> <p>\u2022 Norman Stone, historian, born 8 March 1941; died 19 June 2019</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 June 2019.

There followed Europe Transformed 1878-1919 (1983), a short volume in the Fontana History of Europe, one of the weakest in an uneven series. His second marriage, to Christine Booker (nee Verity), came in 1982. They had a son, and she died in 2016. As a teacher Stone could be inspiring, often winning over his pupils with his charm, which on occasion could be quite considerable, but he became increasingly undisciplined, neglecting his duties, and spending increasing amounts of time playing poker and drinking himself into oblivion in Soho. The Cambridge University history faculty became impatient with his behaviour, but solved the problem of how to deal with him by encouraging him to apply for the professorship of modern history at Oxford, to which he was appointed in 1985 thanks largely to political support from rightwing Oxford dons reinforced by a laudatory reference from Sir Geoffrey Elton, the regius professor at Cambridge. Stone hated Oxford, which he thought (bizarrely) was full of Marxists and out of touch with the real world. He lambasted the university on a regular basis in his newspaper column while continuing to draw his salary (a sum he frequently dismissed as too miserly to keep him in the style to which he had become accustomed), and excoriating it for refusing an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher because of the cuts she had imposed on universities (\u201cWhy should we feed the hand that bites us?\u201d one don memorably asked). On the occasions when he did appear in Oxford to do some teaching, Stone became notorious for groping his female students (one of whom is said to have responded with a slap across the face), and annoyed Worcester College by sub-letting his rooms to make a bit of extra money. In 1997 the university finally grasped the nettle and arranged for his departure, though under financial terms that forced it to delay filling his chair until 2006, the year when he would have reached the statutory age of retirement. Long before this, he had espoused a variety of rightwing political causes, advocating Britain\u2019s departure from the EU, defending the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and supporting Croatia in the Balkan wars. He did some speechwriting for Thatcher and advised her on foreign policy, though she did not listen to his assurances that the reunification of Germany in 1990 was not a danger to European peace. On one occasion he collapsed in front of her, drunk; but she was well known for her indulgence towards alcoholics so long as they supported her politically. After Oxford, he found a berth in Turkey, where he occupied positions at Bilkent and other universities, resigning from one in Ankara because the authorities tried to stop him drinking. He devoted some of his remaining energies to the denial of the genocide of Armenians by Turkey in the first world war, but they were fading rapidly, and his last books \u2013 short histories of the two world wars (2007 and 2013) and The Atlantic and Its Enemies: A Personal History of the Cold War (2010) \u2013 did no justice to his real abilities, mixing worn-out historical clich\u00e9s with random statements of his own personal views. His last post was at the Danube Institute, Budapest, and his last book, Hungary: A Short History (2018) praised the country\u2019s authoritarian leader Viktor Orb\u00e1n among other things for his tough line on immigration. Knowing that he did little research, never bothered to check his facts and relied on his literary flair to mask his mistakes, the publishers got serious historians to go through the text: one of them sent in a 20-page list of errors, but it was impossible to spot them all and so it was left to reviewers to point out the many further inaccuracies. There is nothing wrong with historians being provocative so long as their provocations stimulate one to think again about the subjects they deal with. Niall Ferguson on the right would be one good example of fruitful provocation, just as AJP Taylor was on the left. But Stone\u2019s provocations were little more than the voicing of his own personal political prejudices, and so had little or no effect on the way we think about the past. Journalists often described him as \u201cone of Britain\u2019s leading historians\u201d, but in truth he was nothing of the kind, as any serious member of the profession will tell you. The former prime minister, Heath, was wrong about many things, but he was surely right when he said of Stone during his time in Oxford: \u201cMany parents of Oxford students must be both horrified and disgusted that the higher education of our children should rest in the hands of such a man.\u201d Stone is survived by his sons. \u2022 Norman Stone, historian, born 8 March 1941; died 19 June 2019 \u2022 This article was amended on 26 June 2019. Norman Stone\u2019s first wife, Nicole Aubrey, was the niece rather than the daughter of \u201cPapa Doc\u201d Duvalier\u2019s finance minister.",

Must-reads Stonewall at 50: why the gay bar remains as vital as ever Fifty years after New York\u2019s Stonewall Inn became a symbol for LGBTQ activism, gay bars are declining in numbers across the US. Yet in some areas, particularly in less progressive states and communities, they remain a rallying point at times of both trial and celebration, as Dominic Rushe reports. Toxic America: the risk chemicals pose to children Today in our Toxic America series, we focus on the effects on children of the chemicals in our everyday life. Lauren Zanolli explains how to mitigate the risks to infants, while Emily Holden reports on concerns over chemicals in playgrounds, and Leonardo Trasande argues banning dangerous chemicals could save the US billions. How leftwing economists are transforming capitalism Since the 1970s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom, while surrendering economics to the right. But now, writes Andy Beckett, a transatlantic movement of leftwing economists is building a practical alternative to neoliberalism. The police endorsing violence and racism on Facebook The Plain View project has collated a database of more than 5,000 hateful, racist and Islamophobic messages posted by officers in eight US police departments \u2013 many of whom have been removed from active duty as a result. Adam Gabbatt speaks to the lawyer who launched the project. Opinion The Democratic presidential field will engage in four hours of televised debates this week. How much of that time will be devoted to questions on the climate emergency? Not nearly enough, says Kate Aronoff. When candidate Jay Inslee inquired about doing a special climate-themed debate, the DNC threatened to bar him and any other candidate who participated from the official primary debates.

      "body": "<p>It is Christina Crawford\u2019s 80th birthday on the day we meet, and she is energetic after an opening night. A couple of days earlier, Mommie Dearest, the musical based on her blockbuster 1978 memoir of the same name, had a run-through at Birdland, the renowned New York jazz venue, and she is hoping the show will find backing for a full production. \u201cIt was sold out, it was fabulous,\u201d she says, looking glamorous and spry, before issuing what has become a standard warning: \u201cThe musical had absolutely nothing to do with the movie. I want to put that in big capital letters.\u201d</p> <p>The movie she is referring to is, of course, the 1981 adaptation of Christina\u2019s memoir that starred Faye Dunaway as Joan Crawford, Christina\u2019s adoptive mother, whose abuses, soberly detailed in the book, were turned by the movie into high camp. As chronicled in Mommie Dearest, Crawford slapped, kicked, punched and tried to strangle her daughter, while subjecting her to a severe schedule of cleaning and other household chores, driven by the movie star\u2019s alcoholism and who knows what else. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a language for it,\u201d says Christina. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have laws for it. We didn\u2019t have a social context for it, and we had shame. A tremendous amount of shame, coupled with fear. It wasn\u2019t easy.\u201d She laughs at the understatement. The publication of Mommie Dearest, perhaps the first memoir ever to document child abuse from the point of view of the child, changed the landscape of victim representation and was an early precursor to today\u2019s more robust state of victims\u2019 rights. \u201cI\u2019m not a martyr, but I think, looking back, it is truly amazing to me what one person can do.\u201d</p> <p>It was all a long time ago. Crawford adopted Christina in 1940, and died of a heart attack in 1977. Christina\u2019s younger brother, Christopher, died of cancer in 2006. Lingering interest in the story hinges on enduring fascination with the glamour of that Hollywood era and on the particular contradictions of Crawford. In the context of #MeToo, the story has renewed resonance, and Christina is an interesting case study in the long-range effects of abuse as she tacks between cheerfully declaring herself free from the fallout of her childhood, and testifying to how hard that exorcism has been.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f897977877975958d816289ab9f3d2a3035c45ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f897977877975958d816289ab9f3d2a3035c45ac/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joan Crawford with Christina, Christopher and her adopted twin daughters, Cindy and Cathy, in 1949.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joan Crawford with Christina, Christopher and her adopted twin daughters, Cindy and Cathy, in 1949.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Silver Screen Collection/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She wrote the musical to explicate more fully her relationship with her brother, Christopher \u2013 \u201chow the siblings grow up through the abuse to survive in the real world, with very little going for them except their own love of each other and the will to live\u201d. Long before the term \u201cgaslighting\u201d became mainstream, they were vital as each other\u2019s witness; without Christopher, Christina believes, she wouldn\u2019t have survived. At this many years\u2019 remove, I\u2019m curious as to whether the toxicity of the material continues to have any power over her.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that you ever control it,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you come to terms with it. I honestly don\u2019t think it controls me any more. It is something that you have to live through, and it\u2019s very difficult, because there\u2019s no roadmap for it, even today. Generally speaking, we don\u2019t recognise the long-term psychological damage that is inflicted on people who are abused, neglected and trafficked. It is hard for people to understand that what happened 20 years ago is creating behaviour patterns today.\u201d At the show, a man sitting next to Christina introduced himself to her as the psychiatrist at Rikers Island, the notorious New York prison \u2013 \u201ccoming to our show to learn about post-traumatic stress disorder. I thought this was fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>Christina\u2019s own survival was something she achieved almost entirely without the help of outside agencies. In the US, child protection laws were introduced from the 1960s, and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, creating a single federal focus for preventing and responding to child abuse and neglect, didn\u2019t come into effect until in 1974. Growing up in Hollywood in the 40s and early 50s, Christina had no recourse to the authorities. In fact, after a particularly violent episode she characterises as her mother \u201ctrying to kill me\u201d, it was Crawford herself who called the police and asked them to arrest her daughter for delinquency. \u201cI was 13 or 14. And it was then that I realised the world had gone insane. The officer was very kind. He told me that there was nothing he could do because there were no laws to protect me. He told me: \u2018You have to try to live [here] until you are 18 and can go free. But, otherwise, if anyone calls me again on you, you\u2019ll have to go to juvenile detention.\u2019\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/25/biography.film\">I'll never forgive Mommie: Joan Crawford's daughter gives first interview in 10 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days, I suggest, Crawford would have been given a diagnosis. Christina looks fiercely indignant. \u201cShe would have been in jail! She would\u2019ve been hauled off to jail for attempted murder. What is the excuse for that? There\u2019s no excuse. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. It doesn\u2019t matter. That\u2019s not the issue. And that\u2019s not my responsibility, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The laws changed, and children became better protected. Christina started to get some distance on her childhood. After being sent, at the age of 10, to boarding school, she understood that the rules she grew up under weren\u2019t normal. She tried to build a degree of self-esteem after years of being told by her mother that she was useless. There was no real therapeutic language at her disposal and no framework for recovery. \u201cIt was day by day. I had some teachers, I had some coaches. I had education, which I adored. For me, education was always the path forward and that\u2019s what I used. It has to do with how much you want to be well. Do you want to be free? And some people fail; they just are not strong enough. A lot of them are dead. And a lot of them are in jail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4d1e7dc1d6808135bcd5424891b0426ca78e0d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4d1e7dc1d6808135bcd5424891b0426ca78e0d9/0_1_7815_4689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christina Crawford \u2026 \u2018I am not a martyr.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christina Crawford \u2026 \u2018I am not a martyr.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joshua Bright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She was helped, rather perversely, by a fear of being incarcerated that grew out of her mother\u2019s constant threats to have her put away. \u201cI had a terror of being locked up. How could I not? And my terror of being locked up I think kept me on the straight and narrow.\u201d</p> <p>Fear is the water that abused children swim in, Christina says. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen and your life is so chaotic. But on the other side of the equation, it\u2019s fear from people who are afraid to speak up. Fear that they\u2019re going to lose their job or that people are going to say something bad about them. If you were to ask me about one thing that embraces all of us, it\u2019s the constant fear.\u201d</p> <p>This was precisely her experience. When she was a child, housekeepers, secretaries, nannies and teachers were aware of what was happening, but no one who knew spoke up. After the book came out in 1978, stars of Crawford\u2019s vintage lined up to defend her, as did former members of her household. It was a generational closing of the ranks over what appeared, to Crawford\u2019s contemporaries, to be a piece of monstrous impertinence. Christina laughs very loudly at this. \u201cWell, yes, I think it was! To say the least!\u201d</p> <p>Christina didn\u2019t originally intend to write a tell-all. In her early 20s, she worked as an actor before enrolling on a degree course at UCLA and going on to gain a master\u2019s at the University of Southern California. She would later work in corporate communications. After a period of estrangement in the latter years of her mother\u2019s life, she attempted a reconciliation. Did she think the rapprochement was real?</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it turned out not to have been. No, towards the end, she didn\u2019t have any work. She was an alcoholic. She was ill. She was drug-addicted. And I think she just wasn\u2019t playing with a full deck. And as soon as I left New York to go back to California to work, I completely lost context \u2013 not contact, but context with her, because I wasn\u2019t physically present. Then she died.\u201d</p> <p>In spite of the apparent reconciliation, Christina and Christopher were cut out of the will, for what Crawford cited as \u201creasons which are well known to them\u201d. Christina was so furious she went straight to her desk and started writing down everything that had happened in her childhood.</p> <p>The book sold more than a million copies and suffered an enormous pushback from contemporaries of Crawford\u2019s. It was gaslighting, pure and simple, but Christina wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cNo, I understood Hollywood,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI knew where they were coming from \u2013 they were guilty of seeing and not saying. It was blaming the messenger for the bad news. Most of them are dead now; I have outlived all of them! And I never replied to any of them, or responded. I simply stuck to the message that I knew to be the truth.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cead8db6edb87998b20ccbb1bb812f78008c008b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cead8db6edb87998b20ccbb1bb812f78008c008b/0_64_2343_1405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mara Hobel and Faye Dunaway in the film adaptation of Mommie Dearest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mara Hobel and Faye Dunaway in the film adaptation of Mommie Dearest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Paramount</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Her two younger siblings disputed the book, too, not unusual in an abusive family. \u201cDifferent people in the family experience the parenting situation in different ways. Because the parenting situation is different towards them, and that\u2019s a divide-and-conquer type of situation.\u201d</p> <p>Christopher, in spite of his desire for privacy, remained wholly supportive, she says, and she received thousands of letters \u201cfrom people all over the world who had never heard somebody speak up on their behalf before. And that took me forward on a wave of faith.\u201d</p> <p>The ripple effect is still being felt. \u201cLook at Michigan State, with the gymnasts. Look at Ohio State, with the athletes. Look at Penn State [where the abusive football coach, Jerry Sandusky, was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse]. This is right now.\u201d Even with hashtags exhorting people to believe victims, the law still lags and there is a big caveat around domestic abuse, about which people have a tendency to say \u201cwho knows what really happened\u201d, says Christina. If she could change one law, it would be the statute of limitations. \u201cWhen you have a statute of limitations against sexual abuse of children, then most of the perpetrators go free because some states only have three years. Some have 10. Maybe some have 20. But if it happens to children, then by the time they get old enough to speak out, or to understand what happened to them, the statute of limitations has been reached. And that\u2019s all about protecting the perpetrator.\u201d</p> <p>In 1981, Christina had a debilitating stroke, underwent a five-year long recovery and, for the past 25 years, has lived in rural Idaho, writing a series of follow-ups to Mommie Dearest. I hope her musical finds a backer. It is a timely story, and the focus on her relationship with Christopher is very touching.</p> <p>The fear doesn\u2019t go away when the abuser dies. \u201cNo,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s internal.\u201d With time, and work, however, it lessens. Now, when Christina unexpectedly sees a photo of her mother, she has no reaction. \u201cNothing. No.\u201d</p> <p>Is it indifference?</p> <p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s just \u2026 acceptance.\u201d Can she still be ambushed by responses laid down in her childhood: the fight or flight, hardwired in her brain?</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Not any more.\u201d She smiles. \u201cIt has been a long time.\u201d</p>",

Christina laughs very loudly at this. \u201cWell, yes, I think it was! To say the least!\u201d Christina didn\u2019t originally intend to write a tell-all. In her early 20s, she worked as an actor before enrolling on a degree course at UCLA and going on to gain a master\u2019s at the University of Southern California. She would later work in corporate communications. After a period of estrangement in the latter years of her mother\u2019s life, she attempted a reconciliation. Did she think the rapprochement was real? \u201cI thought it was,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it turned out not to have been. No, towards the end, she didn\u2019t have any work. She was an alcoholic. She was ill. She was drug-addicted. And I think she just wasn\u2019t playing with a full deck. And as soon as I left New York to go back to California to work, I completely lost context \u2013 not contact, but context with her, because I wasn\u2019t physically present. Then she died.\u201d In spite of the apparent reconciliation, Christina and Christopher were cut out of the will, for what Crawford cited as \u201creasons which are well known to them\u201d. Christina was so furious she went straight to her desk and started writing down everything that had happened in her childhood. The book sold more than a million copies and suffered an enormous pushback from contemporaries of Crawford\u2019s. It was gaslighting, pure and simple, but Christina wasn\u2019t surprised. \u201cNo, I understood Hollywood,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI knew where they were coming from \u2013 they were guilty of seeing and not saying. It was blaming the messenger for the bad news. Most of them are dead now; I have outlived all of them! And I never replied to any of them, or responded. I simply stuck to the message that I knew to be the truth.\u201d Her two younger siblings disputed the book, too, not unusual in an abusive family. \u201cDifferent people in the family experience the parenting situation in different ways. Because the parenting situation is different towards them, and that\u2019s a divide-and-conquer type of situation.\u201d Christopher, in spite of his desire for privacy, remained wholly supportive, she says, and she received thousands of letters \u201cfrom people all over the world who had never heard somebody speak up on their behalf before. And that took me forward on a wave of faith.\u201d The ripple effect is still being felt. \u201cLook at Michigan State, with the gymnasts. Look at Ohio State, with the athletes. Look at Penn State [where the abusive football coach, Jerry Sandusky, was convicted of 45 counts of child sexual abuse]. This is right now.\u201d Even with hashtags exhorting people to believe victims, the law still lags and there is a big caveat around domestic abuse, about which people have a tendency to say \u201cwho knows what really happened\u201d, says Christina. If she could change one law, it would be the statute of limitations. \u201cWhen you have a statute of limitations against sexual abuse of children, then most of the perpetrators go free because some states only have three years. Some have 10. Maybe some have 20. But if it happens to children, then by the time they get old enough to speak out, or to understand what happened to them, the statute of limitations has been reached. And that\u2019s all about protecting the perpetrator.\u201d In 1981, Christina had a debilitating stroke, underwent a five-year long recovery and, for the past 25 years, has lived in rural Idaho, writing a series of follow-ups to Mommie Dearest. I hope her musical finds a backer. It is a timely story, and the focus on her relationship with Christopher is very touching. The fear doesn\u2019t go away when the abuser dies. \u201cNo,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cBecause it\u2019s internal.\u201d With time, and work, however, it lessens. Now, when Christina unexpectedly sees a photo of her mother, she has no reaction. \u201cNothing. No.\u201d Is it indifference? \u201cNo. It\u2019s just \u2026 acceptance.\u201d Can she still be ambushed by responses laid down in her childhood: the fight or flight, hardwired in her brain? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so. Not any more.\u201d She smiles. \u201cIt has been a long time.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A landmark ruling in the New South Wales supreme court has again raised concerns about defamation law in Australia, and has the potential to significantly affect the way media companies engage with the social media giant Facebook. Judge Stephen Rothman this week found media companies could be regarded as the publishers of comments made on Facebook, and as such have a responsibility to ensure defamatory remarks are not posted in the first place. It effectively means news organisations have a responsibility to pre-moderate comments on Facebook, significantly increasing the burden of using the social media site and creating a new challenge in grappling with Australia\u2019s defamation laws. What did the ruling say? Judge Rothman\u2019s ruling was part of an ongoing defamation trial brought by Dylan Voller against a number of media companies including News Corp and Channel Nine. Voller, whose treatment as a detainee inside the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre in the Northern Territory triggered a royal commission in 2016, is suing the Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Centralian Advocate newspapers, as well as Sky News Australia\u2019s the Bolt Report. The action relates not to the articles themselves, but to comments made about Voller by members of the public on 10 Facebook posts published on the companies\u2019 public Facebook pages in 2016 and 2017, which he alleges carried false and defamatory imputations. While media companies were already liable for Facebook comments made on articles posted on their public pages, previously the test related to whether a publisher had been negligent in not removing potentially defamatory comments. For example, in Duffy v Google in 2015 the South Australian supreme court found the search engine was liable for defamatory material about Dr Janice Duffy appearing in its search results. The court found that once Google was alerted to the defamatory material, it was then under an obligation to act to censor its search results and prevent further harm to Duffy\u2019s reputation. The ruling was upheld by the full court on appeal in 2017. But Voller had not alleged the media companies were negligent or reckless in failing to delete the comments, and instead Rothman found there was a responsibility to moderate comments pre-publication. He found that media companies engaged with Facebook because of a commercial imperative \u2013 increased reader engagement through the social media platform allows publishers to charge more for advertising \u2013 and as such assumed the risk of potentially defamatory comments. Rothman also found that it was possible for media companies to essentially pre-moderate comments by using filters which included pronouns, definite and indefinite articles, and all conjunctions and prepositions. \u201cThe judge recognised there is no in-built system on Facebook that allows you to prevent the publication of comments on Facebook prior to it becoming public,\u201d Paul Gordon, a social media lawyer from Wallmans Lawyers in Adelaide said. \u201cBut he also found it would be possible to create a filter using commonly used words like \u2018and\u2019, \u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, \u2018but\u2019, in order to capture most posts. And that\u2019s what he said media organisations should be doing, duct-taping together a filter using common words.\u201d Who does it affect? According to Gordon, Rothman\u2019s ruling is not necessarily limited to just media companies. The ruling could potentially impact on any business operating a public Facebook page with a commercial motivation, depending in part on the content itself. \u201cI think it can extend to any company that runs a public Facebook page,\u201d he said. \u201cThe key element here though was that news outlets not only publish controversial content, but do so for the purpose of gaining commentary. But if someone on a company\u2019s Facebook page posted something particularly controversial, I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t apply. There\u2019s no part of the law or common law which says it only applies to media companies.\u201d Does the ruling apply retrospectively? Yes. A common law ruling doesn\u2019t change the law, it merely sets a precedent for how the courts should interpret an existing law. In general terms, defamation action in Australia can\u2019t be brought after one year from \u201cthe date of the publication of the matter complained of\u201d. But that definition is complicated by online publications. Unlike other jurisdictions including the UK, Australia does not have a \u201csingle publication rule\u201d, which would limit a defamation action to the date of the first publication. It means that in relation to online publications, it\u2019s possible for people suing for defamation to argue that an article is a \u201ccontinuing publication\u201d if it is still available online, meaning the limitation period is effectively open-ended. Does it include personal Facebook pages? Gordon thinks that\u2019s unclear. Rothman\u2019s judgment makes some comment about the technical differences between a public and a private Facebook page for the purposes of defamatory comments. But Gordon says the judgment \u201cdoesn\u2019t come to a conclusion in a meaningful way\u201d about defamatory comments on a private page. \u201cThe finding here is effectively that the media companies, by posting a controversial story to a public page which was providing them with a commercial benefit, were effectively encouraging the publication of defamatory material,\u201d he said. \u201cThere could be an argument made that if you made the post in a personal capacity the same argument should apply, but the judgment doesn\u2019t go into that in any great deal.\u201d So, who\u2019s liable if, for example, someone makes a defamatory comment on an article posted in a large private Facebook group? The commenter, the poster of the article, or the administrator? \u201cIt\u2019s probably all three,\u201d Gordon says. \u201cThe judge did say the third parties (that is, the commenters) in this case, if the content is defamatory, are certainly all publishers,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the media organisations that are liable here, it\u2019s just that they are the ones with the money.\u201d Does it extend to other social media platforms? Probably not. The finding was \u201cquite Facebook centric\u201d, Gordon says, particularly because of its focus on the capacity for media companies to pre-moderate comments by imposing restrictive word filters. \u201cThe judge came to his decision because there was this mechanism which allowed the media organisations to create a de facto filter,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there are other social media platforms that do have the filter it could become relevant however.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former South Yorkshire police chief superintendent who was in command of the 1989 FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough, where 96 people were killed, will face a retrial on a charge of gross negligence manslaughter, a judge has ruled. Sir Peter Openshaw, who presided over the 10-week trial of Duckenfield earlier this year in which the jury failed to reach a verdict, handed down his ruling on Tuesday after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) applied for a retrial. The new trial will be at Preston crown court on 7 October. Handing down his decision, Openshaw said: \u201cI authorise a retrial of the defendant David Duckenfield, and refuse the defendant\u2019s application to stay the trial.\u201d Relatives of some of the 96 people killed at Hillsborough 30 years ago were in the court\u2019s public seats to hear Openshaw order the retrial. Benjamin Myers QC, who conducted Duckenfield\u2019s defence at the trial, had opposed the application. The jury that heard evidence in the prosecution at Preston crown court between 14 January and 25 March returned on their eighth day of deliberations on 3 April to say they had been unable to reach a verdict by the required majority of 10-2. Duckenfield, 74, was charged with gross negligence manslaughter in relation to 95 of the 96 people who died at the match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989. Richard Matthews QC, the lead barrister for the CPS, told Openshaw on the same day the jury failed to reach its verdict that the service intended to seek a retrial. The jury did return a 10-2 majority guilty verdict against the other defendant, Graham Mackrell, the Sheffield Wednesday secretary and safety officer for the Hillsborough ground at the time of the disaster, on a charge of breaching his legal duty to keep people safe at his place of work. Mackrell negligently allocated too few turnstiles \u2013 only seven \u2013 for the 10,100 people with tickets to stand and support Liverpool on the Leppings Lane terrace, and only 23 turnstiles altogether for the 24,000 people with tickets allocated to Liverpool supporters. The 96 victims, aged between 10 and 67, were killed at the match in a crush in the central \u201cpens\u201d, 3 and 4, of the Leppings Lane terrace. No charge was brought against Duckenfield in relation to the 96th person to die, Tony Bland, who was critically injured in the crush and was maintained on life support in hospital until 1993, when support was lawfully withdrawn. According to the law in 1989, a criminal charge relating to a death could not be brought if the victim died more than a year and a day after the acts that allegedly caused it.",

Three months previously their country had suffered something appalling: the earthquake and tsunami that struck the coast of Tohoku that March had cost thousands of lives and, at moments like that, talk of football\u2019s restorative power could hardly seem more inadequate. The conversations among the squad were serious, earnest, intense; the eventual decision was that they should travel and, on a dizzying night in Frankfurt, it was vindicated in ways nobody could have foreseen.</p> <p>Saki Kumagai knows how to handle pressure. In 2016 she scored the winning penalty for Lyon, her brilliant club side, in the Champions League final against Wolfsburg. But five years before that she was just 20, a utility player who had joined Urawa Reds from high school, when she was handed the chance to let a grieving nation take leave of its senses for just a moment.</p> <p>\u201cThe feeling I had was that I was enjoying the situation, and that I wasn\u2019t nervous at all,\u201d Kumagai would say later.

Strangers hugged on commuter trains. The darkness had been pierced by a shaft of light that everyone was keen to welcome in; one whose source would have struggled to raise pulses at all in previous years. The nation needed an affirmative story like this and it was a transformative one on a sporting level, too.</p> <p>No Asian team had won a World Cup before even though China, a fading power by this point, had come within their own shootout of toppling the US in the 1999 final. The tournament\u2019s five previous editions had been shared among the US, Germany and Norway, all traditional bastions of a sport desperate to improve its reach. So Japan were pioneers for the rest; they had come through the group stage only twice before 2011 and their win in Germany highlighted that there was a space in which talented, ambitious girls and women could write new stories on the pitch and defy preconceptions, wherever they were from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63bb73bfd12aa1a78e229c1cbbfc1cfa84ec4245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63bb73bfd12aa1a78e229c1cbbfc1cfa84ec4245/0_0_3260_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Morihiro (left) and Chinami Kawasumi (second left), parents of Japan\u2019s forward Nahomi Kawasumi, are among the supporters celebrating the team\u2019s victory at a public viewing at Yamato city, suburban Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"828\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morihiro (left) and Chinami Kawasumi (second left), parents of Japan\u2019s forward Nahomi Kawasumi, are among the supporters celebrating the team\u2019s victory at a public viewing at Yamato city, suburban Tokyo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yoshikazu Tsuno/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Japan were ranked fourth at the time of the tournament but the gap to the US, No 1 in the world, was deemed vast. Yet under their coach, Norio Sasaki, they had mastered an iteration of the tiki-taka style that had become popularised in the men\u2019s game, offsetting their lack of physical bulk by working the ball smartly around and through opponents. It worked in the group stage, although they were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/jul/05/england-japan-womens-world-cup\" title=\"\">beaten by England in Augsburg</a>; it paid off in a sensational quarter-final win over Germany and then, after going an early goal down, in a 3-1 semi-final victory against Sweden.</p> <p>For it to come good one more time, they needed extra reserves of strength. Japan\u2019s \u201cNadeshiko\u201d had never beaten the US in 25 attempts. The need to put smiles on faces back home \u2013 to \u201ctransmit a positive message to everyone that experienced that disaster\u201d as the midfielder Aya Miyama later said \u2013 had never been far from anyone\u2019s mind throughout their run to the final but Sasaki had something else up his sleeve for motivation. Before their previous two games he had shown his players footage of the disaster; on the afternoon of the final, he showed his players a video outlining the history of women\u2019s football in Japan. The successes, failures and the hardships the squad\u2019s predecessors had undergone were all laid bare.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/when-saturday-comes-blog/2019/jun/10/womens-world-cup-rise-stall-football-japan\">The rise and stall of women\u2019s football in Japan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 1980, the first national women\u2019s football tournament in Japan was an eight-a-side affair with 25-minute halves and a rule that decreed players could use their hands to shield the ball from their chests. The following decade, players would often have to scrape money together so that they could travel with the national squad. Interest in the domestic men\u2019s league, fuelled by high-profile arrivals such as Gary Lineker, had not spread across the board; the difference, as Sasaki\u2019s side prepared for a World Cup final in front of nearly 50,000 spectators, was profound.</p> <p>It was not Japan\u2019s best performance, even if they still shaded possession. The belief in the US camp was that, with a brisk start, they could settle things early on but, by half-time and despite an onslaught, Japan went in level. An excellent finish by Alex Morgan eventually put the US ahead but, nine minutes from time, Miyama capitalised on poor defending to jab Japan level.</p> <p>Abby Wambach, earlier thwarted by the woodwork and the outstanding Japan goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori, appeared to have won the World Cup with an extra-time header. Three minutes from the end, though, the inspirational Sawa equalised again with an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbYtKkd9-OE\" title=\"\">outrageous flicked finish from Miyama\u2019s near-post corner</a>. They might have amassed only 14 shots to the US\u2019s 27 but their bottomless resolve had brought them to the brink of something unthinkable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbYtKkd9-OE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xbYtKkd9-OE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That was achieved when Kaihori saved two penalties, Carli Lloyd missed one and Kumagai did her bit. For Kumagai, the month\u2019s success brought a move to \u2013 conveniently \u2013 Frankfurt and, eventually, onwards to the best domestic team women\u2019s football has ever seen. Back home, attendances soared and the sport instantly achieved the legitimacy that had, for so long, been beyond its grasp.</p> <p>The national team would reach the Olympic final a year later only for the US to exact a modicum of revenge in London. True retribution would be meted out in 2015, when the World Cup final of four years previously was reprised in Vancouver and the US won 5-2. But Japan\u2019s very presence in those two fixtures highlighted the consistency, the enthusiasm and the momentum, to which that night in Frankfurt had given rise. Football had a brand new power and there is little sign they are going away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c6b21bafff9636a0b120e414b5d42a0dbf7c1a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c6b21bafff9636a0b120e414b5d42a0dbf7c1a6/0_161_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Japanese team hold a banner after winning the 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Japanese team hold a banner after winning the 2011 Women\u2019s World Cup final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christof K\u00f6psel/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back home Sasaki\u2019s team, and perhaps the sport in general, will forever be associated with their part in a nation\u2019s healing process. \u201cI think they brought courage to the whole nation,\u201d said Naoto Kan, the prime minister in 2011. \u201cAs the prime minister, and as one Japanese citizen, I express my heartfelt gratitude.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u201cWe ran and ran,\u201d the Japan captain Homare Sawa said. \u201cWe were exhausted, but we kept running.\u201d Japan\u2019s footballers had not been completely sure whether to play at the 2011 World Cup. Three months previously their country had suffered something appalling: the earthquake and tsunami that struck the coast of Tohoku that March had cost thousands of lives and, at moments like that, talk of football\u2019s restorative power could hardly seem more inadequate. The conversations among the squad were serious, earnest, intense; the eventual decision was that they should travel and, on a dizzying night in Frankfurt, it was vindicated in ways nobody could have foreseen. Saki Kumagai knows how to handle pressure. In 2016 she scored the winning penalty for Lyon, her brilliant club side, in the Champions League final against Wolfsburg. But five years before that she was just 20, a utility player who had joined Urawa Reds from high school, when she was handed the chance to let a grieving nation take leave of its senses for just a moment. \u201cThe feeling I had was that I was enjoying the situation, and that I wasn\u2019t nervous at all,\u201d Kumagai would say later. She bore the burden spectacularly. Her spot kick, the last one of Japan\u2019s shootout against the US to win the 2011 World Cup, after the sides had been tied at 2-2, was blasted high past Hope Solo and as a delirious delegation poured on to the pitch the ramifications began to sink in. Bars in Tokyo and beyond, many of them packed despite the game concluding at around 6.30am local time, erupted. Strangers hugged on commuter trains. The darkness had been pierced by a shaft of light that everyone was keen to welcome in; one whose source would have struggled to raise pulses at all in previous years. The nation needed an affirmative story like this and it was a transformative one on a sporting level, too. No Asian team had won a World Cup before even though China, a fading power by this point, had come within their own shootout of toppling the US in the 1999 final. The tournament\u2019s five previous editions had been shared among the US, Germany and Norway, all traditional bastions of a sport desperate to improve its reach. So Japan were pioneers for the rest; they had come through the group stage only twice before 2011 and their win in Germany highlighted that there was a space in which talented, ambitious girls and women could write new stories on the pitch and defy preconceptions, wherever they were from. Japan were ranked fourth at the time of the tournament but the gap to the US, No 1 in the world, was deemed vast. Yet under their coach, Norio Sasaki, they had mastered an iteration of the tiki-taka style that had become popularised in the men\u2019s game, offsetting their lack of physical bulk by working the ball smartly around and through opponents. It worked in the group stage, although they were beaten by England in Augsburg; it paid off in a sensational quarter-final win over Germany and then, after going an early goal down, in a 3-1 semi-final victory against Sweden. For it to come good one more time, they needed extra reserves of strength. Japan\u2019s \u201cNadeshiko\u201d had never beaten the US in 25 attempts. The need to put smiles on faces back home \u2013 to \u201ctransmit a positive message to everyone that experienced that disaster\u201d as the midfielder Aya Miyama later said \u2013 had never been far from anyone\u2019s mind throughout their run to the final but Sasaki had something else up his sleeve for motivation. Before their previous two games he had shown his players footage of the disaster; on the afternoon of the final, he showed his players a video outlining the history of women\u2019s football in Japan. The successes, failures and the hardships the squad\u2019s predecessors had undergone were all laid bare. In 1980, the first national women\u2019s football tournament in Japan was an eight-a-side affair with 25-minute halves and a rule that decreed players could use their hands to shield the ball from their chests. The following decade, players would often have to scrape money together so that they could travel with the national squad. Interest in the domestic men\u2019s league, fuelled by high-profile arrivals such as Gary Lineker, had not spread across the board; the difference, as Sasaki\u2019s side prepared for a World Cup final in front of nearly 50,000 spectators, was profound. It was not Japan\u2019s best performance, even if they still shaded possession. The belief in the US camp was that, with a brisk start, they could settle things early on but, by half-time and despite an onslaught, Japan went in level. An excellent finish by Alex Morgan eventually put the US ahead but, nine minutes from time, Miyama capitalised on poor defending to jab Japan level. Abby Wambach, earlier thwarted by the woodwork and the outstanding Japan goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori, appeared to have won the World Cup with an extra-time header. Three minutes from the end, though, the inspirational Sawa equalised again with an outrageous flicked finish from Miyama\u2019s near-post corner. They might have amassed only 14 shots to the US\u2019s 27 but their bottomless resolve had brought them to the brink of something unthinkable. That was achieved when Kaihori saved two penalties, Carli Lloyd missed one and Kumagai did her bit. For Kumagai, the month\u2019s success brought a move to \u2013 conveniently \u2013 Frankfurt and, eventually, onwards to the best domestic team women\u2019s football has ever seen. Back home, attendances soared and the sport instantly achieved the legitimacy that had, for so long, been beyond its grasp. The national team would reach the Olympic final a year later only for the US to exact a modicum of revenge in London. True retribution would be meted out in 2015, when the World Cup final of four years previously was reprised in Vancouver and the US won 5-2. But Japan\u2019s very presence in those two fixtures highlighted the consistency, the enthusiasm and the momentum, to which that night in Frankfurt had given rise. Football had a brand new power and there is little sign they are going away. Back home Sasaki\u2019s team, and perhaps the sport in general, will forever be associated with their part in a nation\u2019s healing process. \u201cI think they brought courage to the whole nation,\u201d said Naoto Kan, the prime minister in 2011. \u201cAs the prime minister, and as one Japanese citizen, I express my heartfelt gratitude.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>If I were a TV producer in search of a big new idea, I would immediately option <em>Magg</em><em>y Garrisson</em>, a collaboration between Lewis Trondheim (words) and St\u00e9phane Oiry (pictures) that began in serial form in 2014 and has now been collected together in English for the first time (it has been translated from the French by Emma Wilson). It\u2019s not only that its occasionally macabre plots are so satisfyingly intricate, nor its settings so vivid. The really big draw is the marvellous and utterly convincing Maggy Garrisson herself, a sardonic tyro private detective whose reserves of initiative and pluck run deeper even than her many flaws (these include drinking, smoking, thieving and sleeping with the wrong blokes). Part <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/08/philip-marlowe-raymond-chandler-john-banville\" title=\"\">Philip Marlowe</a> and part Bridget Jones, it\u2019s slightly surprising that this whip-smart but frequently worn-down young woman from Nottinghamshire could be the creation of two Frenchmen \u2013 but she is, and for this, they deserve all the prizes.</p> <p>Maggy lives in a tiny flat in a shabby corner of north-west London, the city being the story\u2019s second most important character: Oiry draws every location from Kensal Rise to Tottenham Court Road to the interior of Maggy\u2019s favourite pub in such a way that your eye stays with each detail-perfect frame long after you\u2019ve read Trondheim\u2019s pithy dialogue. When the book opens, she has been on the dole for two years, but her luck is about to change. A neighbour has recommended her to Anthony Wight, an ageing private eye whose latest case she will shortly \u201csolve\u201d (rather than finding out what happened to the canary belonging to the old lady upstairs, his new assistant, starting as she means to go on, simply heads out to the nearest pet shop and buys a substitute). Wight, a drinker with shady associates, is good for nothing, but her association with him will nevertheless change Maggy\u2019s life for the better. Henceforth, our heroine will inhabit a world occupied by bent coppers and career criminals \u2013 and to be honest, she will find that she quite likes it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d8e4ba149e2f33929bfb53703399718a441308a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d8e4ba149e2f33929bfb53703399718a441308a/0_0_2244_3071/731.jpg\" alt=\"Maggy Garrisson: she likes a drink\" width=\"731\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maggy Garrisson: she likes a drink.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SelfMadeHero</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anything, after all, is better than being broke \u2013 her first big case proves surprisingly lucrative \u2013 and one of the thugs sent round by a Mr Big to frighten her is so madly attractive, she hardly minds. Maggy\u2019s conscience troubles her only rarely, nor is she exactly what you might call squeamish (later, for complicated reasons, she will gatecrash a funeral where she will attempt to insert a gold tooth in the mouth of the deceased as he lies in an open casket). Life, for her, is about survival, and if this means taking advantage of an old lady or hiding a gun in the crisper box of her fridge, so be it. It has still got to be an improvement on another miserable visit to Sainsbury\u2019s, where the limit of her aspirations is the purchase of cheap biscuits.</p> <p>But who cares, really, about her morals? I like Maggy\u2019s self-sufficiency and lack of self-pity almost as much as I like her frank and distinctly lecherous ways with the opposite sex. She may not be able to solve every mystery, least of all the puzzle that is herself.

      "bodyText": "If I were a TV producer in search of a big new idea, I would immediately option Maggy Garrisson, a collaboration between Lewis Trondheim (words) and St\u00e9phane Oiry (pictures) that began in serial form in 2014 and has now been collected together in English for the first time (it has been translated from the French by Emma Wilson). It\u2019s not only that its occasionally macabre plots are so satisfyingly intricate, nor its settings so vivid. The really big draw is the marvellous and utterly convincing Maggy Garrisson herself, a sardonic tyro private detective whose reserves of initiative and pluck run deeper even than her many flaws (these include drinking, smoking, thieving and sleeping with the wrong blokes). Part Philip Marlowe and part Bridget Jones, it\u2019s slightly surprising that this whip-smart but frequently worn-down young woman from Nottinghamshire could be the creation of two Frenchmen \u2013 but she is, and for this, they deserve all the prizes. Maggy lives in a tiny flat in a shabby corner of north-west London, the city being the story\u2019s second most important character: Oiry draws every location from Kensal Rise to Tottenham Court Road to the interior of Maggy\u2019s favourite pub in such a way that your eye stays with each detail-perfect frame long after you\u2019ve read Trondheim\u2019s pithy dialogue. When the book opens, she has been on the dole for two years, but her luck is about to change. A neighbour has recommended her to Anthony Wight, an ageing private eye whose latest case she will shortly \u201csolve\u201d (rather than finding out what happened to the canary belonging to the old lady upstairs, his new assistant, starting as she means to go on, simply heads out to the nearest pet shop and buys a substitute). Wight, a drinker with shady associates, is good for nothing, but her association with him will nevertheless change Maggy\u2019s life for the better. Henceforth, our heroine will inhabit a world occupied by bent coppers and career criminals \u2013 and to be honest, she will find that she quite likes it. Anything, after all, is better than being broke \u2013 her first big case proves surprisingly lucrative \u2013 and one of the thugs sent round by a Mr Big to frighten her is so madly attractive, she hardly minds. Maggy\u2019s conscience troubles her only rarely, nor is she exactly what you might call squeamish (later, for complicated reasons, she will gatecrash a funeral where she will attempt to insert a gold tooth in the mouth of the deceased as he lies in an open casket). Life, for her, is about survival, and if this means taking advantage of an old lady or hiding a gun in the crisper box of her fridge, so be it. It has still got to be an improvement on another miserable visit to Sainsbury\u2019s, where the limit of her aspirations is the purchase of cheap biscuits. But who cares, really, about her morals? I like Maggy\u2019s self-sufficiency and lack of self-pity almost as much as I like her frank and distinctly lecherous ways with the opposite sex. She may not be able to solve every mystery, least of all the puzzle that is herself. But this unlikely gumshoe of the peeling Victorian terrace, the rattling tube train and the local boozer will always have a go, and sod any trouble it\u2019s likely to bring her. \u2022 Maggy Garrisson by Lewis Trondheim and St\u00e9phane Oiry is published by SelfMadeHero (\u00a314.99).

Edward Sheeran, who grew up in Framlingham in Sussex, gave his own take in the Live Lounge yet somehow the words \u201cat 56 a gram, five a hundred grams though\u201d didn\u2019t seem quite as authentic coming from him.</p> <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOHAUvbuV4o\">Yeo Valley Boyz </a></strong><em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOHAUvbuV4o\">Yeo Valley</a></em></h2> <p>During the years when the X Factor was enormously popular, brands began touting it as a \u201cBritish Super Bowl\u201d and launched desperately wacky campaigns during its ad breaks in the hope of briefly trending on Twitter. Into this thirst for hashtagability stepped four Barbour-clad Yeo Valley farmers \u201cspitting\u201d about how much they loved organic yoghurt. The ad contains many curdling moments but perhaps the sourest taste comes in the third verse when a female farmer tries to make a quick case for farming feminism: \u201cYou won\u2019t find milk maidens, that\u2019s no longer the deal, in my wax coat and boots, I\u2019m proper farmer Giles\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Ed Sheeran Trap Queen \u201cMarried to the money, introduced her to my stove, showed her how to whip it, now she remixin\u2019 for low\u201d sings Fetty Wap on his breakout hit about teaching his stripper girlfriend how to cook up and deal crack cocaine. Edward Sheeran, who grew up in Framlingham in Sussex, gave his own take in the Live Lounge yet somehow the words \u201cat 56 a gram, five a hundred grams though\u201d didn\u2019t seem quite as authentic coming from him. Yeo Valley Boyz Yeo Valley During the years when the X Factor was enormously popular, brands began touting it as a \u201cBritish Super Bowl\u201d and launched desperately wacky campaigns during its ad breaks in the hope of briefly trending on Twitter. Into this thirst for hashtagability stepped four Barbour-clad Yeo Valley farmers \u201cspitting\u201d about how much they loved organic yoghurt. The ad contains many curdling moments but perhaps the sourest taste comes in the third verse when a female farmer tries to make a quick case for farming feminism: \u201cYou won\u2019t find milk maidens, that\u2019s no longer the deal, in my wax coat and boots, I\u2019m proper farmer Giles\u201d. Presumably, the dairy brand was unaware of the famous cockney rhyming slang \u2013 Farmer Giles: piles. Chance the Rapper v Backstreet Boys Dorito\u2019s Flaming Hot Nachos Superbowl ad Meanwhile, the actual Super Bowl remains a hotbed of terrible rap. Chance\u2019s verse here includes lines like \u201cfingers on my hot chips, red-handed come on man, now I\u2019ma need some chopsticks\u201d, although somehow he doesn\u2019t focus on the burning sensation when spicy nachos come out of the other side, even with the potential to rhyme \u201ctastebud cremation\u201d with \u201ccistern ruination\u201d. Macklemore Same Love Here he comes, presumably arriving in a second-hand shellsuit clutching a \u00a31 Full Monty VHS, attempting to write an LGBT rights anthem despite not himself being gay, opening the song by making it 100% clear how not gay he is, telling the story of when he told his mum that he thought he might be gay and she replied: \u201cYou\u2019ve loved girls since before Pre-K!\u201d. Got that, gays? He likes girls! Lady Sovereign Food Play Popular culture is constantly trying to convince us we want to shag our food, from salacious Flake adverts to Samantha covering herself in raw fish in the Sex and the City film. Perhaps the most unappetising attempt comes from this misguided album track by one-time Celebrity Big Brother contestant Lady Sov. Some choice lines include: \u201cDirty dishes in my sink I\u2019ll be your dirty missus ... crack open them Twiglets so we can munch them like piglets\u201d and, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to eat that burger so lets just rub it round your lips\u201d. Someone get a health inspector round to Sov\u2019s; this all sounds deeply unhygienic. McNulty from The Wire Guillemot Dominic Gerard Francis Eagleton West, educated at Eton and Guildhall, here, in a North Face puffa jacket, doing an SB:TV warm-up session. His intentions were honourable, helping to promote the short film Guillemot which was made by young people on the St Ann\u2019s Estate in Nottingham, but you can see on his face he\u2019s only doing it to be a mensch and somehow his lack of commitment to the role makes it worse, doing a kind of semi-street voice half the time but then getting nervous and dropping back into his whispered posho vowels. Catfish and the Bottlemen Black Skinhead Yes Kanye\u2019s post-industrial critique of black consumerism is good, but would it be better if it was being covered by floppy-fringed Miles Kane wannabees Catfish and the Bottlemen? What if it was mashed up with Kasabian and Black Keys songs, so the band could avoid repeating lines like \u201cStop all that coon shit, early morning cartoon shit\u201d? Now that\u2019s hip-hop. Utah Legislature rap It is always difficult to tell with these kinds of \u201cnormal people rapping\u201d videos whether there is a knowing sense that what they\u2019re making is so embarrassing it\u2019ll go viral. But in this track, where the Pillsbury Doughboys of the Utah senate try to explain how a bill gets passed by changing the lyrics to the theme from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, there\u2019s an added layer of incompetence; no effort has been made to time the raps with the backing track so you just get a loose collection of words and Comic Sans captions played near a karaoke beat. No one could mean to make something this bad. Gym Class Heroes Taxi Driver Oh cool, you\u2019ve written a rap song made entirely from the names of emo bands, well I suppose that counts as a poem, here\u2019s a gold star for your Year 7 English book. Oh, you\u2019re planning to release it as a single to be performed atop a whimpering emo guitar line of its own. Cool. Cool cool cool. Madonna American Life If you\u2019re going to continually reinvent your sound and image to remain relevant with contemporary trends, there are going to be some occasions where you get it really, really wrong. Here Madonna stands in front of what looks like a low-budget UN educational video of the flags of the world while she raps: \u201cI\u2019m drinkin\u2019 a soy latte, I get a double shot-e, it goes right through my body\u201d. Perhaps this is what inspired those Yeo Valley ad execs to put the dairy back into rap. Paul McCartney Meat Free Mondays This is only a few seconds long and yet somehow they are the worst few seconds on the entire internet. It starts innocently enough as a quick call to action from Macca to get people to sign up to his vegan mailing list, but as he runs out of things to say, Macca starts rapping the website URL to a clicked beat and then chucking in a bit of patois: \u201cYou can do it\u201d, and, \u201cRight now, please\u201d. Basically, it\u2019s the equivalent of Ringo showing up at his favourite takeaway and asking for \u201ca likkle bit of rice and pea, irie\u201d. Iggy Azalea freestyle Many have tried to transcribe what came out of Iggy Azalea\u2019s mouth at this fateful festival appearance. The best polyglots of the age have all come up with their interpretations, but roughly the verse went: \u201cFRICK CRAP RACK! BULLET TO THE POP POP POOM gonna do a rang, sitty can, no sicky tan, shorty do it in the armoire, no diggos in the motherfuckin\u2019 gnat.\u201d Whatever the exact wording, it felt like this was the moment Iggy went from being a major player in hip-hop to a malfunctioning Bop It that needed to be tossed out. Buck 22 ft Billy Ray Cyrus Achy Breaky 2 Billy Ray Cyrus is currently being celebrated for his feature on Old Town Road but his last country-rap crossover was decidedly lower budget. Teaming up with Buck 22 (us neither), he performed the chorus of his biggest hit while Buck made near continual reference to his daughter\u2019s sexual awakening, while in the video naked women styled to look like Miley twerk around the pair. What a parent. Big Narstie What\u2019s the Story Brixton Glory Big Narstie is a grime MC in much the same way that Neil Hamilton is a politician: it\u2019s not really a job as much as a job title that helps him make regular TV appearances.

Surveys indicate that nearly 65% of Spanish women under 30 now call themselves feminists \u2013 double the number of five years ago. The number of rapes reported shot up by 28% in the first three months of 2018 \u2013 the outcome of the first trial seemed to encourage more women to come forward, rather than deter them. We should be wary of saying that the emboldened feminist movement influenced the supreme court\u2019s decision. Francisco Serrano, a member of Vox, the far-right party, has already condemned the verdict as pandering to the media and leftwing politics. His party pledges to scrap the controversial gender violence law \u2013 which specifically protects women experiencing violence within partnerships \u2013 because it sees it as an ideological tool wielded by militant feminists. But Spanish women\u2019s efforts have not been in vain. The public outcry is likely to influence policymakers. Carmen Calvo, Spain\u2019s acting deputing prime minister, has pledged to change the flawed sexual assault laws to clarify consent in rape trials. The injustice in the wolf pack case has been righted and it has empowered a generation of women. \u2022 Eloise Barry is an English literature undergraduate and an editor on Leeds University\u2019s student paper, The Gryphon",

      "bodyText": "It has long been considered one of the jewels of Latin American statecraft; a shrewd, dependable and highly trained foreign service that helped make Brazil a global climate leader and soft power heavyweight. But six months into the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, even veteran diplomats struggle to mask their horror at the wrecking ball being taken to the country\u2019s nearly two century-old foreign office, known as Itamaraty after the 19th-century Rio palace where it was once housed. \u201cI feel disgusted,\u201d said Rubens Ricupero, Brazil\u2019s former ambassador to the United States and one of the most outspoken critics of the Bolsonarian foreign policy revolution. Since the far-right leader took office in January, his foreign policy team has set about pulverizing decades of diplomatic tradition: cuddling up to rightwing nationalists including Donald Trump, Steve Bannon and the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n; irking China, and jettisoning its position as a climate crisis leader; infuriating longtime Middle Eastern partners by embracing Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s Israel and threatening to move Brazil\u2019s embassy to Jerusalem. All this under a Bible-bashing pro-Trump foreign minister who claims global heating is a Marxist conspiracy and Nazism is a movement of the left. \u201cI would say it is the most dramatic shift in Brazilian foreign policy in a century,\u201d said Oliver Stuenkel, an international relations specialist from the Get\u00falio Vargas Foundation in S\u00e3o Paulo. In interviews with the Guardian, doyens of Brazilian diplomacy described their bewilderment, unease and indignation at seeing such a cherished ministry \u2013 and their country\u2019s place in the world \u2013 turned on its head. \u201cOur current foreign policy takes Brazil back to a period of history at which Brazil didn\u2019t even exist: the Middle Ages,\u201d complained Roberto Abdenur, a former ambassador to China, Germany and the US. Marcos Azambuja, Itamaraty\u2019s former secretary general, said he felt surprised and perplexed by the onset of this new era. \u201cThere has been a change \u2013 and I fear a change for the worse,\u201d said Azambuja, who also served as ambassador in France and Argentina. \u201cI didn\u2019t imagine that this could happen.\u201d \u2018Brazil\u2019s lunatic fringe\u2019 The diplomats\u2019 grievances touch on virtually every area of Brazil\u2019s new foreign policy, from Bolsonaro\u2019s excessive entente with Trump, to his hostility to China and the damage his rhetoric has done to Brazilian soft power. Some fret over Bolsonaro\u2019s interference in the affairs of Brazil\u2019s neighbours, such as Argentina \u2013 where he has warned voters not to vote for Cristina Kirchner \u2013 and Venezuela \u2013 where Brazil has championed efforts to topple Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But the objections begin with the people running the show: Brazil\u2019s foreign minister, Ernesto Ara\u00fajo; the president\u2019s son, Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2013 widely seen as Brazil\u2019s de facto secretary of state; and Olavo de Carvalho, a US-based polemicist of whom both men are disciples. Ricupero claimed the appointment of Ara\u00fajo, a mid-ranking functionary notorious for his eccentric pro-Bolsonaro blogposts, had scandalized Brazil\u2019s diplomatic corps. \u201cWhat I hear from my colleagues who are still active is that among diplomatic staff there is an almost complete rejection of the minister and the current line \u2026 He isn\u2019t taken seriously \u2013 either in or outside the ministry \u2013 because he represents a kind of sect \u2026 that the Americans would call a lunatic fringe,\u201d Ricupero said. There is even greater angst over the role of Eduardo Bolsonaro, a 34-year-old congressman who Steve Bannon recently named the South American frontman for his far-right group The Movement. To the dismay of many diplomats, Eduardo Bolsonaro \u2013 who last year declared Brazil\u2019s foreign service in need of sterilization \u2013 appears even to have offered Bannon a say in policymaking. When Jair Bolsonaro made a state visit to Washington in March, Bannon was invited to dine with him at the Brazilian embassy. \u201cWe are in the perverse, absurd situation of having a foreign citizen influencing Brazil\u2019s foreign policy,\u201d Abdenur protested. \u2018Lose-lose diplomacy\u2019 Potential to damage ties with China \u2013 Brazil\u2019s biggest trading partner \u2013 is perhaps the subject causing diplomats to lose most sleep. Bolsonaro repeatedly attacked Beijing during last year\u2019s presidential race, and Ara\u00fajo is famed for his dislike of what he calls \u201cMaoist China\u201d. Abdenur, Brazil\u2019s top diplomat in Beijing from 1989 to 1993, warned such antagonism could do \u201cserious harm\u201d to Brazil-China relations. Another major gripe is Bolsonaro\u2019s courtship of Trump. Azambuja said Brazil had traditionally enjoyed \u201cexcellent\u201d ties to the US, even under Bolsonaro\u2019s nemesis, the former leftist president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who cultivated an unlikely bond with George W Bush. But getting too close to Trump\u2019s \u201cradicalism\u201d was unwise. Abdenur said he feared that by embracing other nationalist leaders in Poland and Hungary, Brazil would alienate major European democracies. \u201cWe have nothing to gain from it. We can only lose,\u201d Abdenur said. Finally, there is upset over how Bolsonaro\u2019s radical rhetoric and views on the environment and human rights have damaged Brazil\u2019s international image. In March Bolsonaro reportedly scolded his ambassadors for failing to rid him of his overseas reputation as \u201ca racist, homophobe and dictator\u201d. But Ricupero said that was mission impossible. \u201cNo ambassador can try to alter the reality. Bolsonaro is what he is,\u201d he said. \u2018A mitigation job\u2019 Ricupero said some senior diplomats were battling to limit Bolsonaro\u2019s impact: \u201cThey are trying \u2013 to use the language of climate \u2013 to mitigate, to attenuate the effects. It\u2019s a mitigation job.\u201d Other more moderate administration figures \u2013 crucially the vice-president, Hamilton Mour\u00e3o \u2013 have also been engaged in \u201cdamage containment\u201d. In May Mour\u00e3o flew to Beijing to reassure China\u2019s leaders over the relationship and was received by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. But many in Itamaraty are lying low, fearful of being punished for challenging the Bolsonarian line. Since January, three top-level diplomats who were foreign ministers under the former leftist president Dilma Rousseff have been dispatched to less prestigious posts in Croatia, Cairo and Qatar. \u201cThis is really wrong,\u201d Abdenur said. \u201cIt was never common in Itamaraty for there to be witch-hunts or mass sackings or transfers when governments changed, in order to punish.\u201d Ara\u00fajo and Eduardo Bolsonaro did not respond to interview requests from the Guardian. But both men have publicly celebrated what they call a new, ideology-free foreign policy, particularly its alignment with the US and support for the Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3. In a speech to newly graduated diplomats last month Ara\u00fajo urged them to heed Bolsonaro\u2019s \u201cclarion call\u201d and embrace his push for change \u201cas a profound existential commitment\u201d. \u201cWhat moves us is the simple and profound conviction that what we are doing is right,\u201d a tearful Ara\u00fajo added, before declaring Bolsonaro a Christ-like saviour building a \u201cnew Brazil\u201d. Ricupero, who said he was speaking out in the hope of persuading business leaders to pressure Bolsonaro to moderate his foreign policy, begged to differ. Having joined Itamaraty more than 50 years ago, he felt saddened by the direction his country was now taking \u2013 though not surprised given the \u201cgroup of fanatics\u201d in charge. \u201cI have never had any illusions,\u201d Ricupero said. \u201cI always thought this was a disastrous choice.\u201d",

He had been either invisible or deliberately sober to the point of dullness, when his usual primary draw to Tory members is a self-created sense of optimism and fun. Much is also made of his supposed broad appeal to the electorate, evidenced by two terms as London mayor.</p>\n    <p>His bizarre claim to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/26/mesmerising-boris-johnsons-bizarre-model-buses-claim-raises-eyebrows\">make model cardboard buses</a> has raised eyebrows. In most political contests, Johnson\u2019s character \u2013 he has lost more than one job for lying, and has a complex and opaque personal life \u2013 would be a big issue, but among the Tory faithful he seemingly receives a free pass. It remains to be seen what impact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/22/neighbour-who-called-police-over-boris-johnson-row-goes-public\">late-night police visit</a> will have on his chances.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>He has promised to push for a new deal while insisting the UK will leave the EU come what may on 31 October, even if it involves no deal. While his hard Brexit supporters are adamant this is a cast-iron guarantee of leaving on that date, elsewhere Johnson has been somewhat less definitive. Asked about the date in a BBC TV debate, Johnson said only that it was 'eminently feasible', although he then went on to tell TalkRadio that the 31 October deadline was 'do or die'.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Taxation</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>His main pledge has been to raise the threshold for the 40% higher tax rate from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000, at a cost of almost \u00a310bn a year, which would help about 3 million higher earners, a demographic with a fairly sizeable crossover into Tory members.

      "bodyText": "Amber Rudd has called for Boris Johnson to be more explicit on his Brexit plan, warning the Conservative leadership frontrunner that he would face a difficult situation as prime minister, and that \u201centhusiasm and optimism is not sufficient\u201d. Speaking after Johnson broke his recent silence to be questioned about Brexit and his personal life in a BBC interview, Rudd added to warnings that his government could be swiftly brought down if it pushed for a no-deal Brexit. Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, who supports Jeremy Hunt in the leadership contest, said while she would not vote to support a no-confidence motion against a Johnson government to stop no deal, speculation that up to a dozen Tory MPs might do so seemed \u201cabout right\u201d. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, in his first televised interview since his campaign kicked off more than four weeks ago, Johnson said he would never reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds last week. \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones. And there\u2019s a very good reason for that. That is that, if you do, you drag them into things that, really is, is, in a way that is not fair on them,\u201d he said. He defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union, but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement, which some Conservative Eurosceptics have said they believed he was planning to do. Johnson claimed issues including the Irish border would be tackled \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period\u201d but then was forced to agree that the UK would not be entitled to such an implementation period without signing up to the current withdrawal agreement. Asked about the interview on BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Rudd said she had not been entirely convinced. \u201cThere are two problems we have as a government for delivering on this,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s the impasse with the European Union, and there\u2019s the impasse in parliament with MPs. I appreciate Boris\u2019s enthusiasm and his confidence and positivity, but I still think we\u2019re looking for the evidence of what the plan is.\u201d In the interview, Johnson said he would seek to deploy some \u201ccreative ambiguity\u201d over the UK\u2019s \u00a339bn separation payment as a lever to push the EU into new concessions. Rudd said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s enough, no. I think Boris needs to go further in explaining how he would do it. What happens on 31 October if, despite his great powers of persuasion, he has not managed to break this deadlock. We need to understand what the facts are underneath this.\u201d Asked if she would join Conservative MPs such as Ken Clarke in backing a no-confidence motion to block a no-deal departure, Rudd said: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t. But he is right that there are a number of Conservatives who take that view. \u201cThis reinforces the point I\u2019m making, which is this is an incredibly difficult situation, and Boris needs to explain how he will deal with both sides of the Conservative party that have concerns, and try to break the impasse with the European Union. Enthusiasm and optimism is not sufficient.\u201d The junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood has predicted that up to a dozen MPs could rebel. Rudd said: \u201cI think that\u2019s about right. I think it\u2019s slightly less than that, but it\u2019s certainly more than two.\u201d Rudd described Johnson\u2019s wariness of taking part in TV debates against Hunt as \u201cvery odd\u201d. After Johnson said he would not take part in a planned Sky News debate with Hunt on Tuesday night, the broadcaster cancelled the programme. It is understood Johnson declined to take part in Sky\u2019s debate because of terms agreed for an ITV debate next week, which the broadcaster has asked be the first head-to-head debate. However, Hunt\u2019s camp pointed out that Johnson had declined all television debates until Conservative members had begun returning their ballot papers. \u201cBottler Boris and his complacent campaign have shown they can\u2019t trust their candidate to turn up and perform,\u201d a source close to Hunt\u2019s campaign said.",

      "bodyText": "Major media companies and Facebook are scrambling to come to grips with a landmark ruling by an Australian judge that found publishers are legally responsible for pre-moderating comments on the social media site. On Monday in the New South Wales supreme court judge Stephen Rothman found that commercial entities, including media companies, could be regarded as the publishers of comments made on Facebook, and as such had a responsibility to ensure defamatory remarks were not posted in the first place. The judgment has potentially profound impacts on the way news organisations in Australia interact with the social media giant, and prompted immediate backlash from the country\u2019s largest media companies. \u201cThis ruling shows how far out of step Australia\u2019s defamation laws are with other English-speaking democracies and highlights the urgent need for change,\u201d News Corp Australia said in a statement following the ruling. \u201cIt defies belief that media organisations are held responsible for comments made by other people on social media pages. \u201cIt is ridiculous that the media company is held responsible while Facebook, which gives us no ability to turn off comments on its platform, bears no responsibility at all.\u201d The ruling was made in a pre-trial hearing over a defamation case brought by 22-year-old Dylan Voller against a number of media outlets over comments made by readers on Facebook. Voller, whose treatment as a detainee inside the Don Dale youth detention centre in the Northern Territory triggered a royal commission in 2016, is suing the Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Centralian Advocate newspapers, as well as Sky News Australia\u2019s the Bolt Report. The action relates not to the articles themselves, but to comments made about Voller by members of the public on 10 Facebook posts published on the companies\u2019 public Facebook pages in 2016 and 2017, which he alleges carried false and defamatory imputations. News organisations in Australia were already liable for Facebook comments made on articles posted on their public pages, but until now the test related to whether a publisher had been negligent in not removing potentially defamatory comments. However, in a pre-trial ruling on Monday, Rothman found media companies in effect had a responsibility to pre-moderate them. \u201cUp until yesterday the general thread [was] if you knew or ought to have known a defamatory post was there, you had to take it down,\u201d Paul Gordon, a social media lawyer at Wallmans lawyers in Adelaide told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat the judge yesterday found was a bit different, because it wasn\u2019t alleged by Voller that the media companies had been negligent in failing to the take down the comments.

You have a situation where now media companies are responsible not just for taking down comments when they see them, but for preventing them going up in the first place. It places a significantly bigger burden on media companies from what was previously in place.\u201d Rothman found that since media companies use of a public Facebook page \u201cis about their own commercial interests\u201d, they effectively \u201cassume the risks\u201d of defamatory comments made by users. He also found that it was possible for media companies to essentially pre-moderate comments made by users by using comment filters which included pronouns, definite and indefinite articles, and all conjunctions and prepositions. \u201cThe judge recognised there is no in-built system on Facebook that allows you to prevent the publication of comments on Facebook prior to it becoming public,\u201d Gordon said. \u201cBut he also found it would be possible to create a filter using commonly used words like \u2018and\u2019, \u2018he\u2019, \u2018she\u2019, \u2018but\u2019, in order to capture most posts. And that\u2019s what he said media organisations should be doing, duct-taping together a filter using common words.\u201d News Corp Australia has said it is reviewing the decision \u201cwith a view to an appeal\u201d, while the Sydney Morning Herald said it was considering its options and \u201cthe implications the ruling may have on the industry\u201d. Denis Muller, a senior research fellow at the centre for advancing journalism at the University of Melbourne told Guardian Australia the ruling placed \u201ca significant new burden\u201d on media organisations and that \u201cthe obvious question to ask\u201d was whether news companies would reconsider their relationship with Facebook. \u201cThe other thing is to pressure the government to assert under Australian law that Facebook is a publisher and can therefore share in the burden,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see Facebook get away with these things by saying \u2018we\u2019re not a publisher, we\u2019re a common carrier.

It also comes as News Corp Australia, Nine and the ABC prepare to ask the Morrison government this week for an overhaul of media protection laws following Australian Federal Police raids against media companies which sparked press freedom concerns.

That audit is forecast to deliver its report in January 2020. Paladin\u2019s contract \u2013 which currently works out at a cost of at least $1,600 per day for each refugee and asylum seeker, not including food or medical care \u2013 is due to expire next week, and the Department of Home Affairs has refused to clarify whether it would be renewed. Two weeks ago the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said that \u201cthe likelihood is there\u2019s a continuation\u201d. Labor has called for the government to release a commissioned Ernst &amp; Young review into the contract \u2013 ordered in March but not yet released \u2013 before it makes any decision. Last week PNG\u2019s immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, said PNG wanted to take over the contracts and he had written to the home affairs department telling them he expected Paladin\u2019s contract to be cancelled. \u201cPapua New Guinean companies now have the capacity and expertise to do the job and should be given the opportunity to participate,\u201d he said. Paladin\u2019s subcontracts with other companies \u2013 most of which have also been controversial \u2013 also expire on 30 June. It was originally planned for the PNG government to take over the running of services and facilities when the Manus Island detention centre was closed in November 2017, however just before before the anticipated date the PNG government said it couldn\u2019t take over because it was entering a caretaker period ahead of a national election. The Australian government engaged Paladin through a limited tender process, which it said was needed because of the rush, however the contract has been renewed several times since. Guardian Australia has also revealed similar contract processes were used to procure the services of Pacific International hospital for healthcare services on Manus Island.",

Suicide rates for gambling addicts are high, and gambling-related problems cause stress for individuals and families. In response, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/24/nhs-to-open-first-ever-gambling-clinic-for-children\" title=\"\">NHS has opened its first children\u2019s gambling clinic</a>, offering face-to-face treatment \u2013 mostly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p> <p>Out-of-control gambling is linked to complex individual and social problems \u2013 including stress, anxiety and other mental health issues such as bipolar disorder. CBT attempts to tackle the behaviour by dismantling some of the common beliefs and attitudes around it. Gamblers may be encouraged to set themselves realistic limits, fulfil their financial obligations before spending on betting, and to think of gambling as a form of entertainment as opposed to a means of making money.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The gambling industry sends its roots into the cracks in human beings and sucks out whatever it can</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s all very sensible, and is surely a helpful starting point. But it fails to address the unscrupulousness of an industry that targets children by normalising risky practices, couching bets in kid-friendly video games or the deeper mental processes that might lead a person to take serious risks with their own or their family\u2019s money and possessions.</p> <p>Of course not everyone who gambles has a problem \u2013 gambling covers everything from buying a lottery ticket to risking your house in a game of roulette. Betting on anything from tennis to future Tory leaders may be seen as socially acceptable (although many religions take a dim view of any kind of betting). Problems start when gambling comes to fulfil an emotional need, or to buffer certain forms of psychic suffering.</p> <p>In a sense, it often follows the same logic as physical self-harm.

      "bodyText": "Almost half a million children in England and Wales are gambling regularly, with about 55,000 estimated to have a serious problem. Suicide rates for gambling addicts are high, and gambling-related problems cause stress for individuals and families. In response, the NHS has opened its first children\u2019s gambling clinic, offering face-to-face treatment \u2013 mostly cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Out-of-control gambling is linked to complex individual and social problems \u2013 including stress, anxiety and other mental health issues such as bipolar disorder. CBT attempts to tackle the behaviour by dismantling some of the common beliefs and attitudes around it. Gamblers may be encouraged to set themselves realistic limits, fulfil their financial obligations before spending on betting, and to think of gambling as a form of entertainment as opposed to a means of making money. It\u2019s all very sensible, and is surely a helpful starting point. But it fails to address the unscrupulousness of an industry that targets children by normalising risky practices, couching bets in kid-friendly video games or the deeper mental processes that might lead a person to take serious risks with their own or their family\u2019s money and possessions. Of course not everyone who gambles has a problem \u2013 gambling covers everything from buying a lottery ticket to risking your house in a game of roulette. Betting on anything from tennis to future Tory leaders may be seen as socially acceptable (although many religions take a dim view of any kind of betting). Problems start when gambling comes to fulfil an emotional need, or to buffer certain forms of psychic suffering. In a sense, it often follows the same logic as physical self-harm. A sense of unbearable, free-floating anxiety may be funnelled through a self-destructive activity that converts a feeling that\u2019s difficult to process into a palpable act. An unnameable worry becomes a nameable one \u2013 a loss or a cut. Children and adolescents tend to be very much engaged in the tricky business of working out what to do with difficult feelings. Crying and screaming are, one expects, gradually being weeded out in favour of behaviours more conducive to peaceful coexistence. This tends not to be a smooth process. At the same time as trying to contain emotions, young people are also in the process of separating from carers, gradually teetering towards independence.

Our sex life has never been as good as I would like, and this has been a cause of frustration for me. It has become much worse in the past few years. Sex, if it happens at all, is entirely passive for her.</strong></p> <p><strong>If I ask my partner to talk to me about it, no matter how calmly I try to broach the subject, she quickly becomes hysterical. A few minutes of me trying gently to probe about it usually leaves her sobbing, often rocking in a corner, mumbling to herself and accusing me of pushing her too far. Her reaction is so extreme that I can\u2019t imagine what she is thinking. This is not something I try often, as it is very hurtful for both of us, but I want to know why she gets so upset. The last time I tried to talk, she claimed that sex makes her feel violated. She also said that she isn\u2019t broken and that I just have to accept her as she is, so I don\u2019t think she would go to counselling.</strong></p> <p><strong>I find her reaction incredibly hurtful, but it is so important for me to rekindle this aspect of our life. She is quite a closed person who doesn\u2019t reveal her deepest thoughts. I love her and I don\u2019t want us to split up, but I don\u2019t want to be celibate for the rest of my life. I am not sure if she really loves me or whether she is staying with me because of our family, which is really important to her. How can I get us talking about these important aspects of our life?</strong></p> <p>You are right to be concerned. You are both facing a serious relationship challenge that will not get better by itself. There are a number of possible reasons why a person might feel \u201cviolated\u201d during sex, and they all need to be addressed \u2013 if possible through formal therapy or counselling. Sexual withdrawal can happen as a result of stress, anxiety or relationship conflicts; it can also be associated with depression. But sometimes the feeling your wife described can come from past abuse, in which case healing must take place before the survivor can again feel safe during sex. Childhood abuse can be forgotten or buried until the memories are triggered later in life \u2013 sometimes when you have children. Take immediate steps to very kindly insist on getting help \u2013 not just for her, but for you both. If she feels you have identified her as the \u201cpatient\u201d, she will be resentful, ashamed and probably refuse help; instead, be her accomplice in seeking healing support as a couple.</p> <p>\u2022Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</p> <p>\u2022If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to <a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">private.lives@theguardian.com</a> (please don\u2019t send attachments).

Sex, if it happens at all, is entirely passive for her. If I ask my partner to talk to me about it, no matter how calmly I try to broach the subject, she quickly becomes hysterical. A few minutes of me trying gently to probe about it usually leaves her sobbing, often rocking in a corner, mumbling to herself and accusing me of pushing her too far. Her reaction is so extreme that I can\u2019t imagine what she is thinking. This is not something I try often, as it is very hurtful for both of us, but I want to know why she gets so upset. The last time I tried to talk, she claimed that sex makes her feel violated. She also said that she isn\u2019t broken and that I just have to accept her as she is, so I don\u2019t think she would go to counselling. I find her reaction incredibly hurtful, but it is so important for me to rekindle this aspect of our life. She is quite a closed person who doesn\u2019t reveal her deepest thoughts. I love her and I don\u2019t want us to split up, but I don\u2019t want to be celibate for the rest of my life. I am not sure if she really loves me or whether she is staying with me because of our family, which is really important to her. How can I get us talking about these important aspects of our life? You are right to be concerned. You are both facing a serious relationship challenge that will not get better by itself. There are a number of possible reasons why a person might feel \u201cviolated\u201d during sex, and they all need to be addressed \u2013 if possible through formal therapy or counselling. Sexual withdrawal can happen as a result of stress, anxiety or relationship conflicts; it can also be associated with depression. But sometimes the feeling your wife described can come from past abuse, in which case healing must take place before the survivor can again feel safe during sex. Childhood abuse can be forgotten or buried until the memories are triggered later in life \u2013 sometimes when you have children. Take immediate steps to very kindly insist on getting help \u2013 not just for her, but for you both. If she feels you have identified her as the \u201cpatient\u201d, she will be resentful, ashamed and probably refuse help; instead, be her accomplice in seeking healing support as a couple. \u2022Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders. \u2022If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).

And yet, Euphoria is set in a world that looks distinct from the one that was experienced by older generations: the constant hum of active shooter drills, for example, as well as the ubiquity of violent internet pornography. The world of Euphoria is scary not because kids are making poor choices (even though they often are) but because the world that young people today are given looks pretty terrifying. Even Rue\u2019s birth is framed in sadness. She is born just three days after 9/11, her parents holding her while looking on as the Twin Towers fall over and over on the TV.</p> <p>Rue is, of course, a thoroughly unreliable narrator who is completely tethered to her own experiences as a young drug addict. She doesn\u2019t have the historical context or wisdom to understand how many of the feelings she is experiencing aren\u2019t at all specific to the time in which she is growing up, any more than she understands just how much her addiction is hurting the people she loves. And yet, Rue\u2019s unflinching look at what it means to come of age in 2019 gives Gen Z, a generation that has simultaneously been upheld as a beacon of activism and also bemoaned for their supposed arrested development, a chance to explore grief at what it means to grow up at a time when so much seems so bleak.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuAzkZIiGxI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vuAzkZIiGxI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Unlike other teen shows that pride themselves on realism, Euphoria is more interested in providing viewers with an emotional experience and it\u2019s best to view the series as a mood rather than a guide to Gen Z behaviors. After all, according to researchers like <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/\">Jean M</a><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/\"> Twenge</a>, today\u2019s teen is more likely to be lonely and experience anxiety, but also less likely to drive, have sex, or try drugs than previous generations. Heck, teens today are less likely to go out shopping or to a movie without parental supervision. In this way, Zendaya\u2019s Instagram post about the show is more indicative of Gen Z values, than the world her character espouses, \u201cThere are scenes that are graphic, hard to watch, and could be triggering,\u201d she warns, \u201cPlease only watch if you can handle it. Do what is best for you. I will still love you and feel your support. Love, Daya.\u201d</p> <p>It may seem odd to suggest that a show that features full frontal male nudity and statutory rape is less interested in shocking viewers than comforting them, but beneath the show\u2019s explicit exterior is a tender core and Euphoria is at its most successful when it is exploring gentleness as opposed to brutality. One of the most interesting examinations of this is through the show\u2019s look at Rue\u2019s close friend Jules, a transgender girl who seeks out risky sex with much older strangers, but also yearns for love. Jules, who is played brilliantly by Hunter Schafer, may struggle with depression and self-harm, but she is also earnest and kind and her relationship with Rue is marked by adolescent yearning at its most pure.</p> <p>Together, the two young women hold hands while they walk through the halls of their school and sleep together like little otters, wrapping each other tight in each other\u2019s arms. In one early episode, Rue explains how she started crying when Jules told her that all she ever wanted was a close female friend to love and trust. Many of the show\u2019s most intimate moments are conveyed through smartphones and we see how characters rely on the medium in order to relay their deepest emotions to one another. Jules\u2019s interaction with a prospective love interest, for example, is presented with beautiful subtlety as she smiles secretly to herself and cradles her phone on her lap, waiting for the next message to come in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d239a66f7290f7bf06ba604e68a32abb44d149c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d239a66f7290f7bf06ba604e68a32abb44d149c4/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hunter Schafer and Zendaya in Euphoria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hunter Schafer and Zendaya in Euphoria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In contrast, most male expressions of love and sex in Euphoria are unrelentingly brutal. A jock character strives to protect his ultra-feminine girlfriend and concocts fantasies about punishing anyone who touches her, while also going back and forth between treating her like a princess and throwing her against walls. Even the nicer athlete approaches a first-time sexual encounter by grabbing his young partner by the throat, assuming that she is going to like it. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to be sex negative or anything\u201d Rue says, wryly in voiceover, as she explains how scenes like this are common in pornography and often bleed over into real-life sexual encounters, \u201cI\u2019m just saying. This shit isn\u2019t out of left fucking field.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s not, which is why the unrelenting dreariness of the sex on Euphoria struck me as cliche, rather than truly subversive. One of the things that works in exploring Rue\u2019s addiction is that you see her love/hate relationship with getting high. In contrast, sexuality is presented as so bleak and anti-female that you wonder how any of these guys are ever getting laid at all, despite funny moments like when Rue gives a health-class style lecture on the etiquette of dick pics. Most of the expressions of heterosexual female sexuality are depressing, but are also kind of formulaic, with girls being cast aside for being prudes or sluts and \u201cempowerment\u201d being confused with catering to male desire (one lonely young girl becomes a cam girl and gives herself a makeover complete with a removal of her nerdy glasses, for example).</p> <p>This seems like an odd choice at a time when shows like Big Mouth, Sex Education and Pen15 are able to offer nuanced looks at female sexuality that aren\u2019t just about male pleasure and female submission. My hope is that as the series continues, Euphoria allows its female characters the space to do more than just respond to male sexual demands. This is not because I want Euphoria to be a substantively different show than the one it already is, but because I think Euphoria\u2019s power doesn\u2019t just come from its look at darkness, but from its insistence on drawing our attention to those moments of brief intoxicating light.</p> <ul> <li><p>Euphoria is on HBO on Sundays and will air on Sky Atlantic in the UK this summer</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "A US-designed economic blueprint for Israeli-Palestinian peace will be launched in Bahrain on Tuesday, without the participation of either Palestinian or Israeli officials. The Palestinians are boycotting the conference and a late decision was taken not to invite Israelis. A relative handful of Palestinian business leaders are expected in Bahrain, for what is widely seen as a \u201cvanity project\u201d for Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Kushner\u2019s \u201cpeace to prosperity\u201d plan envisages $50bn being spent on investments in the occupied territories and neighbouring countries. The plan includes a $5bn transportation corridor joining the West Bank and Gaza. Kushner told Reuters on Saturday the plan would create a million jobs, halve Palestinian poverty and double the size of the Palestinian economy. However, the whole plan is contingent on a political solution to the seven-decade conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, which looks further away than ever. The Palestinians have rejected the US as a broker because of the Trump administration\u2019s unequivocal support for Israel, and in particular the rightwing government of Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cWe have realised that this economic workshop in Bahrain is going to be really nonsense. It is just simply a theoretical piece of work calling for $50bn,\u201d Mohammad Shtayyeh, the Palestinian authority prime minister, said. The Gaza-to-West Bank transport link idea has a long history, but it has never got off the ground largely because of Israeli political opposition. In general, critics of the plan said, the projects are meaningless as long as the Palestinian economy is under an Israeli stranglehold. Zaha Hassan, visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the overwhelming majority of Palestinian business owners and executives, representing 80% of the economy of the occupied territories, were boycotting the event. \u201cThey know very well what\u2019s been hindering Palestinian economic development and investment in the occupied territories and that\u2019s simply the occupation,\u201d Hassan said. \u201cThey can\u2019t control the borders. They can\u2019t guarantee that they can export or import or that they can get the raw materials in that they need. They can\u2019t send people out for training \u2026 the simple basic things they\u2019re not allowed to do.\u201d The Bahrain conference will be attended by Gulf Arab states as well as Jordan and Egypt, while Israel is expected to send a business delegation. Gerald Feierstein, a former senior state department official, said most of those attending were there for cynical reasons. \u201cSome businesspeople will almost certainly see this as an opportunity to cash in on the proposed $50bn windfall that Kushner has suggested,\u201d Feierstein argued. \u201cBut the Gulf governments are motivated more by the need to curry favor with the Trump administration, and the desire to demonstrate support for Trump\u2019s son-in-law on his favorite vanity project, than by any expectation that this will advance the cause of peace in the Middle East.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the Kushner document is not a plan at all. It is more like a wishlist of all the economic projects that have been or could be proposed in a world where there is no Israeli occupation/siege and where there is virtually unlimited funding,\u201d said Khaled Elgindy, the author of Blind Spot, a history of US-Palestinian relations. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantasy that is completely divorced from reality.\u201d",

Her comments to CNN were the first time she has been seen on camera telling her story. The book in which it appears will be published next Tuesday.</p> <p>Trump has issued <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/22/us/e-jean-carroll-donald-trump.html\">blanket denials</a> of the claims. On Saturday he said he had \u201cno idea\u201d who Carroll was, despite a photograph existing of the two meeting in a social setting from the late 1980s. And in an interview with The Hill on Monday, Trump again <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/450116-trump-vehemently-denies-e-jean-carroll-allegation-shes-not-my-type\">dismissed the allegations</a>, adding, \u201cshe\u2019s not my type\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cnot my type\u201d remark is not the first time Trump has disparaged an accuser. In 2016, after a former magazine writer accused Trump of assaulting her in 2005, he responded: \u201cShe lies! Look at her, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d And when another woman claimed Trump groped her in the early 1980s, he said: \u201cBelieve me she would not be my first choice.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to the president\u2019s comments on CNN, Carroll said: \u201cI love that I\u2019m not his type.\u201d</p> <p>The president has suggested that Carroll\u2019s allegations are designed to make money out of book sales. He has also floated the theory that this is a political conspiracy to discredit him in the week he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/19/trump-2020-campaign-launch-keep-america-great\">launched his campaign</a> for re-election.</p> <p>Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York who is running for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in 2020, <a href=\"https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/de-blasio-nypd-will-investigate-trump-if-they-get-complaint-he-raped-e-jean-carroll/\">said on Saturday</a> that were Carroll to come forward with her allegations, he would authorise a police investigation. \u201cWe will find out the truth,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the reaction to Carroll\u2019s allegations has been strangely muted. In live interviews on Sunday, the vice-president, Mike Pence, was not asked once about the fresh claims of sexual assault made against his boss.</p> <p>The New York Times, which carried Carroll\u2019s allegations and Trump\u2019s subsequent denial on Friday, has launched a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/reader-center/e-jean-carroll-trump-allegations.html\">reader\u2019s editor inquiry</a> into why its 800-word account of Carroll\u2019s allegations was not promoted to the first page until Saturday and only belatedly made it into the paper on Sunday.</p> <p>Some who wrote in to complain questioned whether the lack of prominence revealed deference to the president, misogyny or an unwillingness to believe a victim\u2019s account.</p> <p>The paper\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/reader-center/e-jean-carroll-trump-allegations.html\">said on Monday</a> that critics were correct that the article had been downplayed. \u201cThe fact that a well-known person was making a very public allegation against a sitting president \u2018should\u2019ve compelled us to play it bigger\u2019,\u201d Baquet conceded in conversation with the paper\u2019s Reader Center.</p> <p>The New York Post removed a story about Carroll\u2019s allegations on Friday afternoon. CNN Business <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/media/new-york-post-col-allan-trump/index.html\">reported on Monday</a> that Col Allen, a supporter of Trump and an adviser to the paper, had ordered the removal.</p> <p>Carroll has also been forced to defend her accusations, which could be considered a step away from blaming the victim. She strongly denied to CNN that she was politically motivated in describing the alleged attack in her book What Do We Need Men For?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m barely political. I can\u2019t name you the candidates who are running right now,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Carroll said she was suffering as a result of coming forward. She has received death threats on social media, she said, and fears her career in journalism might be in peril.</p> <p>\u201cWho knows? Donald Trump has gotten people fired,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Carroll gave CNN further vivid details of the attack she says she endured when Trump took her into a dressing room in the lingerie department of the department store.</p> <p>\u201cThe minute he closed that door I was banged up against the wall, hit my head really hard,\u201d she said. \u201cBoom. I was stunned, and then he tried to kiss me, which was repulsive.\u201d</p> <p>She went on: \u201cMy reaction was to laugh to knock off the erotic thing he had going on, but no, he just went at it. He pulled down my tights. There was a fight. I want women to know I did not stand there, I did not freeze, I was not paralysed. No, I fought.\u201d</p> <p>The CNN presenter Alisyn Camerota put it to the writer that what she was describing was an unambiguous case of legal rape. Carroll declined to agree.</p> <p>She said: \u201cI don\u2019t use the word. I have difficulty with the word. I see it as a fight. I don\u2019t want to be seen as a victim because I quickly went past [it]. It was a very brief episode of my life. I\u2019m very careful with that word.\u201d</p> <p>Camerota is well versed in the difficulties women face in cases of sexual misconduct. In April 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/apr/23/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-alisyn-camerota\">she revealed she was sexually harassed</a> by Roger Ailes, the late and ousted Fox News chair, while she was a presenter on that channel.</p> <p>Were Carroll to go to the NYPD, it is by no means certain a case could be mounted, given statute of limitations concerns. New York state removed the five-year statute of limitations for first-degree rape in 2006 but it did not do so retroactively, meaning that all cases that fell before that year \u2013 as Carroll\u2019s allegations do \u2013 are not freed from the restriction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/22/trump-sexual-assault-accuser-e-jean-carroll\">Trump repeats contested claim he does not know latest sexual assault accuser</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That potentially insurmountable roadblock notwithstanding, there are aspects of Carroll\u2019s case that would be of interest to NYPD detectives.

      "bodyText": "E Jean Carroll, the celebrated advice columnist who has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s, has said she is considering bringing a complaint to the New York police department (NYPD). In a lengthy interview with CNN on Monday, Carroll said she would be open to working with the NYPD in a criminal investigation into the attack she alleges happened in the Manhattan store of Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996. \u201cI would consider it,\u201d she said. However, she added that lawyers had advised her that the statute of limitations deadline by which such a complaint would have had to be brought has expired. The advice columnist, whose column Ask E Jean has been a popular feature of Elle for almost 30 years, broke her bombshell allegations in New York magazine on Friday. Her comments to CNN were the first time she has been seen on camera telling her story. The book in which it appears will be published next Tuesday. Trump has issued blanket denials of the claims. On Saturday he said he had \u201cno idea\u201d who Carroll was, despite a photograph existing of the two meeting in a social setting from the late 1980s. And in an interview with The Hill on Monday, Trump again dismissed the allegations, adding, \u201cshe\u2019s not my type\u201d. The \u201cnot my type\u201d remark is not the first time Trump has disparaged an accuser. In 2016, after a former magazine writer accused Trump of assaulting her in 2005, he responded: \u201cShe lies! Look at her, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d And when another woman claimed Trump groped her in the early 1980s, he said: \u201cBelieve me she would not be my first choice.\u201d Responding to the president\u2019s comments on CNN, Carroll said: \u201cI love that I\u2019m not his type.\u201d The president has suggested that Carroll\u2019s allegations are designed to make money out of book sales. He has also floated the theory that this is a political conspiracy to discredit him in the week he launched his campaign for re-election. Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York who is running for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in 2020, said on Saturday that were Carroll to come forward with her allegations, he would authorise a police investigation. \u201cWe will find out the truth,\u201d he said. But the reaction to Carroll\u2019s allegations has been strangely muted. In live interviews on Sunday, the vice-president, Mike Pence, was not asked once about the fresh claims of sexual assault made against his boss. The New York Times, which carried Carroll\u2019s allegations and Trump\u2019s subsequent denial on Friday, has launched a reader\u2019s editor inquiry into why its 800-word account of Carroll\u2019s allegations was not promoted to the first page until Saturday and only belatedly made it into the paper on Sunday. Some who wrote in to complain questioned whether the lack of prominence revealed deference to the president, misogyny or an unwillingness to believe a victim\u2019s account. The paper\u2019s executive editor, Dean Baquet, said on Monday that critics were correct that the article had been downplayed. \u201cThe fact that a well-known person was making a very public allegation against a sitting president \u2018should\u2019ve compelled us to play it bigger\u2019,\u201d Baquet conceded in conversation with the paper\u2019s Reader Center. The New York Post removed a story about Carroll\u2019s allegations on Friday afternoon. CNN Business reported on Monday that Col Allen, a supporter of Trump and an adviser to the paper, had ordered the removal. Carroll has also been forced to defend her accusations, which could be considered a step away from blaming the victim. She strongly denied to CNN that she was politically motivated in describing the alleged attack in her book What Do We Need Men For? \u201cI\u2019m barely political. I can\u2019t name you the candidates who are running right now,\u201d she said. Carroll said she was suffering as a result of coming forward. She has received death threats on social media, she said, and fears her career in journalism might be in peril. \u201cWho knows? Donald Trump has gotten people fired,\u201d she said. Carroll gave CNN further vivid details of the attack she says she endured when Trump took her into a dressing room in the lingerie department of the department store. \u201cThe minute he closed that door I was banged up against the wall, hit my head really hard,\u201d she said. \u201cBoom. I was stunned, and then he tried to kiss me, which was repulsive.\u201d She went on: \u201cMy reaction was to laugh to knock off the erotic thing he had going on, but no, he just went at it. He pulled down my tights. There was a fight. I want women to know I did not stand there, I did not freeze, I was not paralysed. No, I fought.\u201d The CNN presenter Alisyn Camerota put it to the writer that what she was describing was an unambiguous case of legal rape. Carroll declined to agree. She said: \u201cI don\u2019t use the word. I have difficulty with the word. I see it as a fight. I don\u2019t want to be seen as a victim because I quickly went past [it]. It was a very brief episode of my life. I\u2019m very careful with that word.\u201d Camerota is well versed in the difficulties women face in cases of sexual misconduct. In April 2017 she revealed she was sexually harassed by Roger Ailes, the late and ousted Fox News chair, while she was a presenter on that channel. Were Carroll to go to the NYPD, it is by no means certain a case could be mounted, given statute of limitations concerns. New York state removed the five-year statute of limitations for first-degree rape in 2006 but it did not do so retroactively, meaning that all cases that fell before that year \u2013 as Carroll\u2019s allegations do \u2013 are not freed from the restriction. That potentially insurmountable roadblock notwithstanding, there are aspects of Carroll\u2019s case that would be of interest to NYPD detectives. She has kept the clothes that she was wearing during the alleged assault in her closet, where they remain unlaundered to this day. Carroll\u2019s clothing is an echo of the blue cocktail dress worn by Monica Lewinsky, which carried DNA evidence that became important in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Asked by Camerota if she thought her dress could similarly have Trump\u2019s DNA on it, Carroll replied: \u201cI have no idea whether the president ejaculated.\u201d Carroll was asked at length why she had not come forward during the 2016 campaign, and had waited until now. She said that for years she had blamed herself and thought of herself as stupid. But she said she had watched a pattern developing with 16 or more women coming forward to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct \u2013 she had thought \u201cthey were doing the job\u201d, she said \u2013 only for Trump to get away with it. \u201cWith all the women it\u2019s the same: he denies it, he turns it around, he attacks and he threatens \u2013 and then everybody forgets it until the next woman comes along. I am sick of it. I am sick of it.\u201d",

Parents are being misled because the term is being widely used to describe general outdoor \u201cgetting muddy\u201d activities, or one-off environmental sessions.</p> <p>The authors of the book, themselves involved in forest schools, say the idea should be about discovery learning over an extended period, with children involved in meaningful and challenging activities.

      "bodyText": "Ash trees rustle in the breeze while beneath them muddy children run free, collecting leaves and searching for bugs in the shadows. This must be a forest school. Or is it? According to academics in a book, Critical Issues in Forest Schools, to be published next month, there is a high probability that it is not a forest school as, it says, large numbers of nurseries, primaries and secondaries are falsely claiming claim to be one. The forest school movement, introduced to the UK about 25 years ago, has taken off in the last decade, partly as an alternative to the formal, test-driven infant and primary curriculum. It is seen as a way of getting children outdoors, in touch with nature and away from their phones and computers. The concept was inherited from Scandinavian outdoor kindergarten lessons and has grown in the UK into a distinct approach to teaching and learning. The lessons are outdoors, usually in wooded areas, and are learner-centred, and play-based. But some schools and nurseries, in both the state and independent sectors, are using the term as a marketing tool. Parents are being misled because the term is being widely used to describe general outdoor \u201cgetting muddy\u201d activities, or one-off environmental sessions. The authors of the book, themselves involved in forest schools, say the idea should be about discovery learning over an extended period, with children involved in meaningful and challenging activities. These should entail some risk \u2013 lighting fires, or learning to use knives, for example. Taking children outdoors to go pond dipping, or to learn about the Vikings, doesn\u2019t make your school a forest school, says Mark Sackville-Ford, a lecturer in education at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) and co-editor of the book. \u201cForest school sets children free to follow their curiosity, it is slightly subversive, an antidote to the results and test-driven classroom,\u201d he says. The book, a collection of papers from academics and teachers, defines the essence of forest schools, the processes by which children learn in the sessions and the challenges for practitioners. Elizabeth Irvin, headteacher of St Mary\u2019s primary in Stockport, which is a forest school, and a contributor to the book, says not all schools are in it for the right reasons. \u201cThe saddest comment I heard was by a headteacher who said \u2018I can\u2019t afford not to do it because every other school around me is doing it and it looks good on your website\u2019,\u201d she says.

The new collection features 18 artists including H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/21/the-best-albums-of-2018-no-1-christine-and-the-queens-chris\" title=\"\">Christine and the Queens</a>), Kate Tempest, Ibeyi, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/27/tracey-thorn-another-planet-a-teenager-in-suburbia-book-extract\" title=\"\">Tracey Thorn</a>, Nadine Shah, and Alison Moyet, as well as producer Catherine Marks, Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo, and more.</p> <p> Here, Raphael reflects on the myriad changes over the past 25 years in society, the music industry, #MeToo, technology and social media, observing: \u201cThe mid-90s now seem not like a different country, but a different universe.\u201d While there were other artists Raphael would have liked to include in the new collection (it shares a title with Solange Knowles\u2019s 2016 album), time with A-listers tends to be limited and therefore limiting. As it is, there\u2019s a diverse mix of well-known artists and emerging talents. As with <em>Bollocks</em>, all subjects had copy approval so they could talk without fear of being misrepresented.</p> <p>The result is a series of wide-ranging, deep-dive, soul-baring interviews, full of candid, intimate, spiky meditations on inspiration, artistry, sexuality, race, love, self-doubt, abuse, defiance, and everything in between. There\u2019s Letissier on being empowered by drag culture: \u201cI gave a name to my anger.\u201d Shah on sexism: \u201cI met more than one arse-slapping pervert along the way.\u201d Tempest on discovering hip-hop and spoken word: \u201cI\u2019d found it.

      "bodyText": "Amy Raphael\u2019s A Seat at the Table: Interviews With Women on the Frontline of Music is a (sort of) follow-up to her 1995 book, Never Mind the Bollocks: Women Rewrite Rock, which carried extensive first-person interviews with the likes of Bj\u00f6rk, Courtney Love and Kim Gordon, and a foreword by Deborah Harry. The new collection features 18 artists including H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier (Christine and the Queens), Kate Tempest, Ibeyi, Tracey Thorn, Nadine Shah, and Alison Moyet, as well as producer Catherine Marks, Radio 1 DJ Clara Amfo, and more. Here, Raphael reflects on the myriad changes over the past 25 years in society, the music industry, #MeToo, technology and social media, observing: \u201cThe mid-90s now seem not like a different country, but a different universe.\u201d While there were other artists Raphael would have liked to include in the new collection (it shares a title with Solange Knowles\u2019s 2016 album), time with A-listers tends to be limited and therefore limiting. As it is, there\u2019s a diverse mix of well-known artists and emerging talents. As with Bollocks, all subjects had copy approval so they could talk without fear of being misrepresented. The result is a series of wide-ranging, deep-dive, soul-baring interviews, full of candid, intimate, spiky meditations on inspiration, artistry, sexuality, race, love, self-doubt, abuse, defiance, and everything in between. There\u2019s Letissier on being empowered by drag culture: \u201cI gave a name to my anger.\u201d Shah on sexism: \u201cI met more than one arse-slapping pervert along the way.\u201d Tempest on discovering hip-hop and spoken word: \u201cI\u2019d found it. The thing. My thing.\u201d Moyet on ageism: \u201cPop music is the only arena in which it is assumed that your creativity decreases as you age.\u201d Amfo on being fist-bumped when everyone else gets a handshake: \u201cDon\u2019t dehumanise me \u2026 because I happen to be a black person.\u201d Rereading Never Mind the Bollocks together with A Seat at the Table, it\u2019s clear that Raphael had carved a vital space for female artists to \u201cwoman-spread\u201d, as it were, and speak freely. Women in music taking up space, making some noise \u2013 the female voice turned up louder. Even if you have only the sketchiest notions about bluegrass (people who resemble extras from Deliverance playing banjos fast?), there\u2019s much of interest in Wayfaring Stranger. Writer and classically trained violinist Emma John spent a year in the Appalachian mountains exploring this country roots form, which developed in the 40s: \u201cThe sound of an America of long ago: of railroads and prison gangs, of church revival and illegal liquor \u2026 An antique hybrid blending of Celtic and country sounds with blues, jazz, gospel\u201d. While John does not flinch from prominent disturbing issues (racism, guns, Trumpism, the neo-Nazi parades in Charlottesville), her aim was to immerse herself, not stand apart. \u201cI felt like an anthropologist stumbling across an uncontacted civilisation,\u201d writes John, as she reveals a vibrant secret world, replete with history, creativity, and sub-genres (fast jams, slow jams, progressive grass, hardgrass, spacegrass), as well as passions, rivalries and charismatic characters \u2013 not least the \u201cfather of bluegrass\u201d, Bill Monroe, who died in 1996. In communities so isolated that her arrival makes headlines in newspapers, John takes her \u201cfiddle\u201d (actually a centuries-old violin) to participate in \u201ccircles\u201d of ever-welcoming \u201cpicking\u201d friends anywhere she can (festivals, barns, dive bars, basements), pushing herself not just to equal the skill and pace of bluegrass, but embrace its spirit. In this way, Wayfaring Stranger goes beyond being an entertaining informative book about a niche musical genre: it becomes the story of John\u2019s personal mission to shake off a kind of existential stiffness \u2013 an inhibiting perfectionism \u2013 to rediscover not just her passion for music, but also for life. She concludes that, though she arrived on the bluegrass scene a \u201cstranger\u201d, she wasn\u2019t allowed to stay one for long.

If you would like to receive this as a weekly email, please sign up here. And you can catch our monthly Brexit Means \u2026 podcast here. Top stories In case you\u2019ve been residing temporarily on another planet, the former and current foreign secretaries, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, made it through to the final runoff round of the Conservative leadership contest. Almost instantly, Johnson became embroiled in a row over a late-night altercation with his girlfriend that was loud and worrying enough for a neighbour to call the police \u2013 but not for the the potential future PM to answer any questions about. Johnson came under increasing pressure to explain the row not just from Hunt, who accused the former London mayor of trying to \u201cslink through the back door\u201d of No 10 by \u201cpathetically\u201d evading questioning, but other ministers and a major Tory donor. Hunt later upped the ante as Johnson refused to appear on a Sky debate. Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans \u2013 including a no-deal exit \u201cif necessary\u201d on 31 October, with article 24 of the general agreement on tariffs and trade ensuring there would be no tariffs on UK exports to the EU \u2013 were also criticised as pie in the sky by the chancellor, Philip Hammond, the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, and the international trade secretary, Liam Fox. Despite all the above, however, polls found that the former London mayor \u2013 although his popularity took a substantial hit \u2013 was still seen by Conservative members (his immediate electorate) as more trusted to make big decisions and negotiate with the EU, and more competent, than his rival. At an EU summit in Brussels, meanwhile, the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, said Johnson might make the Brexit process \u201ceven more exciting\u201d, but the withdrawal agreement had been sealed and would not change. EU leaders now think Britain will crash out of the EU on 31 October unless the deal is ratified or the new PM calls a second referendum or election this summer. Britain\u2019s former envoy to the EU, Ivan Rogers, said the country was being led to no deal by a political elite who had \u201cgreat difficulties discerning and telling the truth\u201d. Should an early election (see below) end up being called, the Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, went on the record as saying he would be interested in local coalition pacts with the Conservatives to help ensure the UK left the EU without a deal. At the other end of the political spectrum, Hilary Benn called Brexit a \u201ccomplete and utter mess\u201d and demanded that Labour unambiguously back a second referendum, while Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, said the party would have to back remain to survive. What next More and more people think early elections are likely after the new prime minister engages unsuccessfully with EU capitals and Michel Barnier\u2019s team to obtain the changes to the Irish backstop he thinks might get the deal through parliament (none exist, as this piece makes clear). Several MPs have \u201chuge concerns\u201d about whether Johnson or Hunt could command the confidence of the Commons and avoid an autumn election, and the junior defence minister Tobias Ellwood said up to a dozen Conservative MPs could support a no-confidence motion against the new government. Johnson could also decide to trigger an election himself with the backing of two-thirds of MPs, but would be unlikely to be able to organise it before the 31 October Brexit deadline without an extension, which he will not want to ask for.

Best of the rest UK finances forecast to suffer under most forms of Brexit. Brexit: alternative to Irish backstop \u201cfeasible in three years\u201d. Brexit viewed with incredulity overseas, says ambassador. Ease migration rules for Indians to win post-Brexit deals, say MPs. Vital medicine supplies at risk if UK crashes out of EU, MPs warned. Barclay and Barnier clash on citizens\u2019 rights under no-deal Brexit. Top comment In the Guardian, Anand Menon and Alan Wager say the contest between Johnson and Hunt is really about who can win a looming general election: None of the Brexit tales being told by the candidates bears any relationship to the real world.

      "body": "<p>What was the first novel in the English language? This seemingly benign question is the source of centuries of literary squabbles. Some claim the title for Thomas Malory\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/englit/malory/\">Le Morte d\u2019Arthur</a>; others insist it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/30/100-best-books-robinson-crusoe\">Robinson Crusoe</a>, but there are also camps for Moll Flanders and Pamela.</p> <p>Now there is one more to add to the mix: a little-known contender about a coterie of talking cats and an alchemist that dates back to the 16th<sup> </sup>century. As cute as it sounds today, this book was so potentially inflammatory at the time, with its themes of sexual violence and religious satire tucked beneath its fuzzy feline plot, that its author, William Baldwin, hid the manuscript away at the height of the Reformation. Its title alone, Beware the Cat \u2013 thought to be a shortening of \u201cBeware the Catholic\u201d \u2013 might have got him killed.</p> <p>He finally published it in 1561, but the book fell out of fashion and lay forgotten for centuries. In the 1990s, academics began to read it with fresh eyes and found all the signs of an early novel \u2013 a central linear narrative, character and motivation, as well as a beginning, middle and end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"348bc766c6a2389cb4aa8da306580e8814198ea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/348bc766c6a2389cb4aa8da306580e8814198ea9/0_0_850_1536/553.jpg\" alt=\"Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats by TS Eliot.\" width=\"553\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats by TS Eliot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now, a group of English Literature scholars are adapting Baldwin\u2019s story into a theatrical experience to spread the word and convince the wider world of its novelistic properties. Rachel Stenner, a lecturer in the English department at Sussex University, says the aim is \u201cfor as many people as possible to know about Baldwin. He is an important figure that many have never heard of.\u201d</p> <p>Stenner conceived the project with Frances Babbage, professor of theatre at Sheffield University, as well as Terry O\u2019Connor, an honorary professor at Sheffield University and one part of the experimental theatre ensemble <a href=\"https://www.internationalibsenaward.com/2016-forced-entertainment\">Forced Entertainment</a>. Penny McCarthy, a reader in fine art at Sheffield Hallam University, produced all the artwork for the adaptation, basing her cat drawings on her own pet cat. Together, they have performed the play at Sheffield and as part of the Brighton Fringe. Now they are taking it to the RSC\u2019s The Other Place in Stratford<strong>.</strong></p> <p>They describe Baldwin as a formidable, if forgotten, figure of 16th-century literature. His influence may in fact have reached William Shakespeare, who might have named the witches\u2019 cat in Macbeth \u2013 Grimalkin \u2013 after one of Baldwin\u2019s cats who appears decades earlier.</p> <p>In Baldwin\u2019s story the cats are good, bad and dastardly, but mostly heroic and more morally upstanding than humans. Alongside them is a Catholic priest dabbling in alchemy. After drinking a potion, he learns to understands the cats caterwauling on his central London rooftop and a wacky plot follows, including a testimony from a ravished female cat who is seeking justice in a nocturnal cat court.</p> <p>For cat-lovers, a story about talking cats is nothing new. There have been innumerable fictive felines, from TS Eliot\u2019s slinky poems to JK Rowling\u2019s shapeshifting Minerva McGonagall, but also on Robinson Crusoe\u2019s island and in James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses when Mr Bloom buys liver from the butcher\u2019s to fry up and feed the cat.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I always suspect my cat knows more than I can tell</p> <footer> <cite>Penny McCarthy</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Baldwin\u2019s book, the story is positioned at cat\u2019s eye level, a little like the perspective in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Philosophically, Baldwin was asking the kind of questions with which 20th-century philosophers have since grappled, says Bob McKay, a senior lecturer in English Literature at Sheffield whose research has focused on animals living beside humans in literature.</p> <p>A seminal essay by Jacques Derrida, entitled \u201cThe Animal That Therefore I Am\u201d, is a perfect example. The point Derrida makes in it, he says, is that throughout the history of philosophy we have looked at animals and made pronouncements about them but the animals are looking back at us. Baldwin\u2019s text was asking some of the same questions as Derrida centuries ago, adds McKay: \u201cDo animals have reason? Is there an insurmountable boundary between you and the gaze of the cat or is there some way you can get across that divide? Can we bridge this gap between us and the animal Other?\u201d</p> <p>Cats are an alternative moral guardian in Baldwin\u2019s story as well, says O\u2019Connor, wiser and more moral than the humans. \u201cYou are reminded that your cat is watching you and has access to all your secrets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cfffde1f20f7bcca83add421ed5f62909107da2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cfffde1f20f7bcca83add421ed5f62909107da2/0_195_1908_1525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One of artist Penny McCarthy\u2019s illustrations for Beware the Cat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"799\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of artist Penny McCarthy\u2019s illustrations for Beware the Cat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Penny McCarthy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYes,\u201d says McCarthy: \u201cI always suspect my cat knows more than I can tell.\u201d</p> <p>In the adaptation, chapters are read out from behind a table by various performers while an array of McCarthy\u2019s cat drawings appear on an overhead projector. There are also dramatic asides, not spoken, but written on boards, and held up to the audience.</p> <p>The team of academics wanted to push the boundaries of what can and should be classed as theatre. The production is informed by performance art, fine art, cinema and song, says O\u2019Connor. \u201cWe wanted the audience to love the performance for all its linguistic qualities. The idea was to create a listening space and reflect on what it meant to be read to in our times.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Beware the Cat is at <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/beware-the-cat\">the Other Place</a>, Stratford-upon-Avon, on 6 July and the Workshop Theatre in Leeds on 23 November.</p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "What was the first novel in the English language? This seemingly benign question is the source of centuries of literary squabbles. Some claim the title for Thomas Malory\u2019s Le Morte d\u2019Arthur; others insist it is Robinson Crusoe, but there are also camps for Moll Flanders and Pamela. Now there is one more to add to the mix: a little-known contender about a coterie of talking cats and an alchemist that dates back to the 16th century. As cute as it sounds today, this book was so potentially inflammatory at the time, with its themes of sexual violence and religious satire tucked beneath its fuzzy feline plot, that its author, William Baldwin, hid the manuscript away at the height of the Reformation. Its title alone, Beware the Cat \u2013 thought to be a shortening of \u201cBeware the Catholic\u201d \u2013 might have got him killed. He finally published it in 1561, but the book fell out of fashion and lay forgotten for centuries. In the 1990s, academics began to read it with fresh eyes and found all the signs of an early novel \u2013 a central linear narrative, character and motivation, as well as a beginning, middle and end. Now, a group of English Literature scholars are adapting Baldwin\u2019s story into a theatrical experience to spread the word and convince the wider world of its novelistic properties. Rachel Stenner, a lecturer in the English department at Sussex University, says the aim is \u201cfor as many people as possible to know about Baldwin. He is an important figure that many have never heard of.\u201d Stenner conceived the project with Frances Babbage, professor of theatre at Sheffield University, as well as Terry O\u2019Connor, an honorary professor at Sheffield University and one part of the experimental theatre ensemble Forced Entertainment. Penny McCarthy, a reader in fine art at Sheffield Hallam University, produced all the artwork for the adaptation, basing her cat drawings on her own pet cat. Together, they have performed the play at Sheffield and as part of the Brighton Fringe. Now they are taking it to the RSC\u2019s The Other Place in Stratford. They describe Baldwin as a formidable, if forgotten, figure of 16th-century literature. His influence may in fact have reached William Shakespeare, who might have named the witches\u2019 cat in Macbeth \u2013 Grimalkin \u2013 after one of Baldwin\u2019s cats who appears decades earlier. In Baldwin\u2019s story the cats are good, bad and dastardly, but mostly heroic and more morally upstanding than humans. Alongside them is a Catholic priest dabbling in alchemy. After drinking a potion, he learns to understands the cats caterwauling on his central London rooftop and a wacky plot follows, including a testimony from a ravished female cat who is seeking justice in a nocturnal cat court. For cat-lovers, a story about talking cats is nothing new. There have been innumerable fictive felines, from TS Eliot\u2019s slinky poems to JK Rowling\u2019s shapeshifting Minerva McGonagall, but also on Robinson Crusoe\u2019s island and in James Joyce\u2019s Ulysses when Mr Bloom buys liver from the butcher\u2019s to fry up and feed the cat. In Baldwin\u2019s book, the story is positioned at cat\u2019s eye level, a little like the perspective in a Tom and Jerry cartoon. Philosophically, Baldwin was asking the kind of questions with which 20th-century philosophers have since grappled, says Bob McKay, a senior lecturer in English Literature at Sheffield whose research has focused on animals living beside humans in literature. A seminal essay by Jacques Derrida, entitled \u201cThe Animal That Therefore I Am\u201d, is a perfect example. The point Derrida makes in it, he says, is that throughout the history of philosophy we have looked at animals and made pronouncements about them but the animals are looking back at us. Baldwin\u2019s text was asking some of the same questions as Derrida centuries ago, adds McKay: \u201cDo animals have reason? Is there an insurmountable boundary between you and the gaze of the cat or is there some way you can get across that divide? Can we bridge this gap between us and the animal Other?\u201d Cats are an alternative moral guardian in Baldwin\u2019s story as well, says O\u2019Connor, wiser and more moral than the humans. \u201cYou are reminded that your cat is watching you and has access to all your secrets.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d says McCarthy: \u201cI always suspect my cat knows more than I can tell.\u201d In the adaptation, chapters are read out from behind a table by various performers while an array of McCarthy\u2019s cat drawings appear on an overhead projector. There are also dramatic asides, not spoken, but written on boards, and held up to the audience. The team of academics wanted to push the boundaries of what can and should be classed as theatre. The production is informed by performance art, fine art, cinema and song, says O\u2019Connor. \u201cWe wanted the audience to love the performance for all its linguistic qualities. The idea was to create a listening space and reflect on what it meant to be read to in our times.\u201d Beware the Cat is at the Other Place, Stratford-upon-Avon, on 6 July and the Workshop Theatre in Leeds on 23 November.",

Lustig, who had never been in a cinema until Menashe had its premiere at the Sundance film festival in 2017, took a risk in acting in a film that would be shown to the secular world, but felt it was an important story to tell. He decided not to seek his rabbi\u2019s permission before taking the role. \u201cIt would have been nice if I\u2019d have asked but I didn\u2019t want to put him in a corner.\u201d He believes he is leading the way in what he describes as \u201ckosher entertainment\u201d. \u201cI broke the ice, but I wasn\u2019t afraid [of the potential backlash] and people now try to copy me.\u201d Alpert believes that Haredim project something positiveabout themselves and the communities in which they live through their films. It can, he says, create a better understanding between ultra-Orthodox and secular societies. \u201cWhen they see us on screen, they see us for how we are.\u201d He suggests films about parenting, which is an issue for everyone, as an example. \u201cReligious or not, we just give another way to look at it.\u201d",

Foreign volunteers arrive too, helping with research such as collecting samples of zooplankton, which the mantas feed on. They also assist in getting tissue samples from the rays used by scientists to trace their population movements at a laboratory belonging to Peru\u2019s sea institute, Imarpe. Veteran volunteer Ken Dubuque, a board member for Earthwatch, says: \u201cWhat we\u2019re really pushing is local community involvement and this project exemplifies that.\u201d But the mantas face problems that community-based conservation may have little impact on. Ocean microplastics are a growing threat to these filter-feeding giants, says Forsberg. Scientists are studying how the climate emergency might affect ocean wildlife at this juncture between the cold-water, nutrient-rich Humboldt Current, which sweeps up from Antarctica, and warmer tropical waters. But in this region renowned for its sunny beaches and seafood, the ecotourism incentive is providing protection not just for the giant manta ray but also for five types of sea turtle, sea lions, whale sharks and breeding humpback whales.",

A friend of mine says it is the only thing that gets his baby to fall asleep, and he\u2019s not RoboCop. Even weirder, science backs them up. White noise is the product of all audible frequencies; as a result, it effectively masks background sounds. Equal intensity across frequencies means one is less likely to be disturbed by sudden noises: foxes getting sexy, Rory Stewart at the door, a smoke alarm, whatever. The lack of fluctuation also makes it possible to tune out the white noise itself. It is an impressive sleep solution for noisy environments, a kind of constructed calm (and yet you can still hear the smoke alarm).</p> <p>The fan sound isn\u2019t loud, but covers other nocturnal noise, including my neighbour\u2019s yapping dogs, who live outside. I still hear them, but the noise is less piercing, and eventually I forget they are there. In that sense, it is remarkable. Yet to fall asleep and wake up to the same noise feels relentless. Like falling asleep in a wind tunnel, dreaming that someone is holding your head out of an aeroplane, then waking to the sound of someone vacuuming upstairs.</p> <p>I wonder if this is what the country mouse feels for the city mouse: a revulsion for his aurally battered, overstimulated existence. Nerves set on edge by noise, only able to be calmed by further noise. Are we condemned to this ceaseless moving of air, the waves and layers of an overpopulated soundscape? I yearn for stillness after noise \u2013 or is it death I\u2019m thinking of? I don\u2019t know if that is exactly how the mouse sees it, as they seem quite grain-focused. But what do I know? I can hardly hear myself think.</p> <p>There are those for whom Marpac\u2019s device is a dream come true. I would rather drift off to Melvyn Bragg droning on about Marinetti, Brian Eno\u2019s trippy lift music or a CD of whale song (though they are probably singing about how lost they are due to background military sonar). Dohm\u2019s fan noise feels like being trapped in an overheated old computer, at risk of catching on fire. It sounds dystopian to me, like using a Geiger counter as a metronome. If you yearn for the lullaby of the machines, why not stick the dishwasher on at night, or play a recording of the M4, or, you know, buy a fan?</p> <h2><strong>Weirdest promise</strong></h2> <p>\u201cSet yourself up for Sleep-Cess!\u201d says the box, in a cartoon font. I\u2019m not certain what \u2018Sleep Cess\u2019 is but it sounds dung-related. Sweet dreams!</p> <h2><strong>Wellness or hellness?</strong></h2> <p>Dohm give up the day job. Or do, and move to the country.<strong> 3/5</strong></p>",

A friend of mine says it is the only thing that gets his baby to fall asleep, and he\u2019s not RoboCop. Even weirder, science backs them up. White noise is the product of all audible frequencies; as a result, it effectively masks background sounds. Equal intensity across frequencies means one is less likely to be disturbed by sudden noises: foxes getting sexy, Rory Stewart at the door, a smoke alarm, whatever. The lack of fluctuation also makes it possible to tune out the white noise itself. It is an impressive sleep solution for noisy environments, a kind of constructed calm (and yet you can still hear the smoke alarm). The fan sound isn\u2019t loud, but covers other nocturnal noise, including my neighbour\u2019s yapping dogs, who live outside. I still hear them, but the noise is less piercing, and eventually I forget they are there. In that sense, it is remarkable. Yet to fall asleep and wake up to the same noise feels relentless. Like falling asleep in a wind tunnel, dreaming that someone is holding your head out of an aeroplane, then waking to the sound of someone vacuuming upstairs. I wonder if this is what the country mouse feels for the city mouse: a revulsion for his aurally battered, overstimulated existence. Nerves set on edge by noise, only able to be calmed by further noise. Are we condemned to this ceaseless moving of air, the waves and layers of an overpopulated soundscape? I yearn for stillness after noise \u2013 or is it death I\u2019m thinking of? I don\u2019t know if that is exactly how the mouse sees it, as they seem quite grain-focused. But what do I know? I can hardly hear myself think. There are those for whom Marpac\u2019s device is a dream come true. I would rather drift off to Melvyn Bragg droning on about Marinetti, Brian Eno\u2019s trippy lift music or a CD of whale song (though they are probably singing about how lost they are due to background military sonar). Dohm\u2019s fan noise feels like being trapped in an overheated old computer, at risk of catching on fire. It sounds dystopian to me, like using a Geiger counter as a metronome. If you yearn for the lullaby of the machines, why not stick the dishwasher on at night, or play a recording of the M4, or, you know, buy a fan? Weirdest promise \u201cSet yourself up for Sleep-Cess!\u201d says the box, in a cartoon font. I\u2019m not certain what \u2018Sleep Cess\u2019 is but it sounds dung-related. Sweet dreams! Wellness or hellness? Dohm give up the day job. Or do, and move to the country. 3/5",

In 2019, plastic production and incineration will add over 850m metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere \u2013 equivalent to the emissions from 189 coal-fired power plants. By 2050, these emissions could rise to 2.8bn metric tons, equivalent to 615 new coal plants.</p> <p>Why are these emissions growing so rapidly? Because plastics are made almost entirely from fossil fuels. Natural gas, oil and coal account for 99% of what goes into plastic. Thus, plastic\u2019s climate impacts begin not in the oceans, but at the wellheads and drillpads where plastic is born.</p> <p>Moreover, refining those raw materials into plastic is among the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all industrial processes. In 2015, just 24 ethylene facilities in the United States emitted as much carbon dioxide as 3.8m passenger vehicles. Globally fracking to produce ethylene produced as many emissions as 45m passenger vehicles.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastics could creat 56bn metric tons in greenhouse emissions by 2050</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The North American fracking boom is poised to make this situation much worse. Fueled by cheap fracked gas, Exxon, Shell and other petrochemical producers are massively expanding the infrastructure for making plastic. The American Chemistry Council <a href=\"https://www.americanchemistry.com/Shale-Infographic/\">projects</a> that the industry will invest over $200bn in more than 330 new or expanded facilities by 2025. Just one of these facilities, a massive ethane cracker being built by Shell in Pennsylvania, could emit up to 2.25m tons of CO<sub>2</sub> yearly.</p> <p>Nor do emissions end once plastic\u2019s useful life is over. While the carbon emissions associated with recycling are minimal, less than 9% of plastic is recycled annually. Effective recycling rates are lower still. As indicated by China\u2019s recent ban on plastic waste imports, much of the plastic waste that has been sent to Asia for recycling has no economic value. It was and always has been just trash. In the face of China\u2019s import ban, communities are increasingly turning to incineration as the way to deal with that trash. This incineration alone could add 4bn metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere by 2050.</p> <p>If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastic production, use and disposal could create 56bn metric tons in cumulative greenhouse emissions by 2050 \u2013 consuming a staggering 13% of the Earth\u2019s entire remaining carbon budget.</p> <p>The climate impact of plastic that escapes into the environment is harder to quantify, but may be even more significant. Research demonstrates that the 57tn microplastic particles at the ocean\u2019s surface continually release small amounts of greenhouse gases \u2013 and will continue doing so indefinitely. The climate impacts of this are difficult to quantify because those surface particles represent only a fraction of 1% of plastic in the ocean. Nor do they include the massive amounts of plastic on beaches, riverbanks and farmlands worldwide that are releasing greenhouse gases even faster.</p> <p>More troublingly, scientists have found that microplastics are interacting with and often negatively affecting plankton in ocean basins worldwide. These microscopic plants and animals form the foundation of ocean ecosystems and also create the biological carbon pump that makes the oceanic carbon sink function.

      "bodyText": "Plastics are among the most ubiquitous materials in our economy, our lives, and our environment. They are also among the most pervasive and persistent pollutants on Earth. In recent years, stark images of beaches, waterways and wildlife filled with plastic have spurred demands for action to address plastic pollution. These calls are coupled with growing concern that plastic and its toxic additives pose serious risks to human health at every stage of the plastic lifecycle. Far less attention has been paid to the impacts of this same lifecycle on the Earth\u2019s climate. This is a dangerous oversight. From catastrophic wildfires in California to searing heatwaves and record drought in India, the scale and growing severity of the climate crisis are undeniable. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that humanity must limit warming below 1.5C or face far greater and potentially irreversible climate chaos. To achieve this, we must cut global emissions 45% by 2030 and reach zero net emissions by 2050. A recent report by the Center for International Environmental Law and partners shows that plastic\u2019s rapidly rising emissions put these critical goals at risk. In 2019, plastic production and incineration will add over 850m metric tons of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere \u2013 equivalent to the emissions from 189 coal-fired power plants. By 2050, these emissions could rise to 2.8bn metric tons, equivalent to 615 new coal plants. Why are these emissions growing so rapidly? Because plastics are made almost entirely from fossil fuels. Natural gas, oil and coal account for 99% of what goes into plastic. Thus, plastic\u2019s climate impacts begin not in the oceans, but at the wellheads and drillpads where plastic is born. Moreover, refining those raw materials into plastic is among the most energy- and carbon-intensive of all industrial processes. In 2015, just 24 ethylene facilities in the United States emitted as much carbon dioxide as 3.8m passenger vehicles. Globally fracking to produce ethylene produced as many emissions as 45m passenger vehicles. The North American fracking boom is poised to make this situation much worse. Fueled by cheap fracked gas, Exxon, Shell and other petrochemical producers are massively expanding the infrastructure for making plastic. The American Chemistry Council projects that the industry will invest over $200bn in more than 330 new or expanded facilities by 2025. Just one of these facilities, a massive ethane cracker being built by Shell in Pennsylvania, could emit up to 2.25m tons of CO2 yearly. Nor do emissions end once plastic\u2019s useful life is over. While the carbon emissions associated with recycling are minimal, less than 9% of plastic is recycled annually. Effective recycling rates are lower still. As indicated by China\u2019s recent ban on plastic waste imports, much of the plastic waste that has been sent to Asia for recycling has no economic value. It was and always has been just trash. In the face of China\u2019s import ban, communities are increasingly turning to incineration as the way to deal with that trash. This incineration alone could add 4bn metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere by 2050. If growth continues on its present trajectory, plastic production, use and disposal could create 56bn metric tons in cumulative greenhouse emissions by 2050 \u2013 consuming a staggering 13% of the Earth\u2019s entire remaining carbon budget. The climate impact of plastic that escapes into the environment is harder to quantify, but may be even more significant. Research demonstrates that the 57tn microplastic particles at the ocean\u2019s surface continually release small amounts of greenhouse gases \u2013 and will continue doing so indefinitely. The climate impacts of this are difficult to quantify because those surface particles represent only a fraction of 1% of plastic in the ocean. Nor do they include the massive amounts of plastic on beaches, riverbanks and farmlands worldwide that are releasing greenhouse gases even faster. More troublingly, scientists have found that microplastics are interacting with and often negatively affecting plankton in ocean basins worldwide. These microscopic plants and animals form the foundation of ocean ecosystems and also create the biological carbon pump that makes the oceanic carbon sink function. This raises the currently unquantifiable but deeply troubling prospect that rising plastic pollution could disrupt the Earth\u2019s largest natural carbon sink, further accelerating the climate crisis. Whether measured by its impacts on the climate, environment, or human health, the rising flood of disposable plastic creates risks humanity can no longer accept. Just as the roots of the climate and plastic crises are interlinked, so too are their solutions. Simply put, it\u2019s time to break free from plastic. We must end the production of single-use, disposable plastic, stop the development of new oil, gas and petrochemical infrastructure, and accelerate the transition to sustainable, circular economies and zero-waste communities.

      "bodyText": "Of all the things I\u2019ve ever wanted to do in life, being naked and trapped inside a haystack has never been one of them. But four hours into my stay in Italy, that\u2019s exactly where I find myself. I\u2019m in South Tirol \u2013 a place renowned for its affinity with nature. Bordering Austria and Switzerland, it is a gorgeous sliver of rocky landscape, peppered with lagoons, spiky peaks and orchard-lined hills. It is also one of the most environmentally sound places on the map, priding itself on its sustainable, eco-friendly practices. Our first stop \u2013 and host of my straw-chaffing induction \u2013 is Gargazzone, a sleepy village north-west of the provincial capital, Bolzano. On arrival at Theiner\u2019s Garten \u2013 which describes itself as a bio-hotel, with a wellness garden, sustainable power and organic produce \u2013 I foolishly ask what the most nature-loving Tirolean thing I could do is. The result is to be led immediately downstairs to a room, told to get undressed and lie on a table strewn with itchy hay. After getting into place, the masseur unceremoniously dumps a further bale\u2019s worth on top of me, wraps me in white gauze then leaves my mummified, Worzel Gummidge-esque corpse to stew for 45 minutes. Every 10 minutes, a sinister bubbling erupts from beneath me, and a burst of steam rises to invigorate the aroma of the hay. \u201cThe hay bath is designed to relieve pain in the kidneys and joints,\u201d says Stefan H\u00fctter, the hotel owner. \u201cThe locals find it relaxing.\u201d That\u2019s not exactly how I would describe it but after learning not to wriggle painfully around in the prickles, the experience is oddly enjoyable. When my wife picks me up, we head for a swim at nearby Naturbad (\u20ac7 for a day ticket, evening \u20ac3.20), a manmade, mountain-enveloped lido, bestrewn with phytoplankton and zooplankton that clean the water organically instead of chemicals. The natural, chlorine-free pool is lush and the surroundings \u2013hill-lined orchards with distant shards of white Dolomite rock \u2013 is postcard-perfect. A 10-minute stroll takes us to Kathi\u2019s Jausenstation, a family-run restaurant framed by a sprawling rose garden, and popular with radler (shandy)-drinking cyclists. Enjoying some spinach gnocchi (mains from \u20ac7) and a glass of Hugo \u2013 the elderflower aperitif named after the Bolzano barman who invented it in 2005, we can immediately see how South Tirol\u2019s cultural cohabitation works, with staff switching effortlessly between German and Italian and a menu that boasts both schnitzel and spaghetti. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t always like that,\u201d H\u00fctter tells us later. \u201cTwenty years ago, if you were an Austrian girl and you brought an Italian boy home, there could be trouble.\u201d Until the end of the first world war, South Tirol was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire but was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1919, as a reward for joining the allies in 1915. After an initial wave of Austro-German persecution, and a brief period of German occupation in the latter stages of the second world war, South Tirol has steadily recovered and now exists as a harmonious, extensively self-governed province. \u201cThe rest of Italy is 10 years behind what we are doing here in South Tirol,\u201d H\u00fctter claims, referring to the region\u2019s upsurge in ecological thinking. \u201cThe other week I bought an organic ice-cream and some Italians said \u2018Why would you buy an organic ice-cream? Italian ice-cream is the best in the world as it is!\u2019\u201d The province is indeed about as sustainable place as you will find. Thanks to large sums of public investment, a third of the region is now powered by various sustainable sources \u2013 hydropower, biomass, biogas, as well as wind and geothermal energy \u2013 and the new, back-to-basics approach to farming has transformed the region into a vibrant organic food community. What is particularly noticeable though, is the amount of green travel \u2013 bikes and ebikes are everywhere, and there are more than 80 public charging points for electric cars. Our next stop is south at Caldaro, a grape-growing municipality in the heart of South Tirol\u2019s wine region. After a quick stop at Lago di Caldaro \u2013 a swimmer-filled lake by morning, windsurf-flipping spectacle by afternoon \u2013 we arrive at one of the three vineyards of Alois Lageder \u2013 the legendary wine producer, who takes us on a personal tour. As well as being regarded as one of South Tirol\u2019s greatest exporters, his winery\u2019s set of strict biodynamic principles is what beds him nicely into the landscape of this eco-conscious region. We sample a quintet of refreshing whites, then two of the region\u2019s indigenous red grapes \u2013 very light and drinkable varieties known as schiava and lagrein. It is when we reach Lageder\u2019s favoured pinot noir, however, that his tour reaches its crescendo, his right hand shooting out theatrically with each describing word as he lauds \u201cthe complexity \u2026 the power \u2026 the finesse!\u201d We finish the day with a short hike to the Maurerberg alpine refuge (\u20ac48 a night) in San Martino in Badia, in the heart of the Dolomites.

Privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to dominate high-ranking jobs: 39% had an independent education compared with 7% of the general population, according to a study called Elitist Britain 2019 by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Elitist education is \u2018pipeline\u2019 to top jobs Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray with the day\u2019s conversation-starters. Members of the uppermost echelons of British politics, the judiciary, media and business are five times more likely to have been to private school than the general population. Privately educated people, many of whom went to Oxbridge, continue to dominate high-ranking jobs: 39% had an independent education compared with 7% of the general population, according to a study called Elitist Britain 2019 by the Sutton Trust and Social Mobility Commission. The report identifies a \u201cpipeline\u201d from fee-paying schools through Oxbridge and into top jobs. Luke Heselwood from the Reform thinktank says the \u201cscandalous\u201d figures show that the UK is far from being a meritocracy. \u201cFixing this will require serious reform to the education system as, despite improvements, the most advantaged are nearly 10 times more likely to attend elite universities than the most disadvantaged.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cThe old boys\u2019 network and the old school tie still hold back talented and hard-working people from less privileged backgrounds.\u201d * * * Love holding me back, says Johnson \u2013 Boris Johnson has set out on a media blitz in which he is vowing never to reveal the events that led to the police being called to the home of his partner Carrie Symonds. The Tory leadership frontrunner insisted on the BBC that \u201cI do not talk about stuff involving my family, my loved ones\u201d because \u201cthat is not fair on them\u201d. Johnson is now understood to be rolling out a \u201cmedia blitz\u201d for the coming days, beginning with a series of closely controlled events on Tuesday. Rival Jeremy Hunt\u2019s camp pointed out that \u201cbottler Boris\u201d has declined all television debates until Conservative members have already begun returning their ballot papers. In a BBC interview, Johnson defended his Brexit plan to renegotiate a deal with the European Union but admitted he could not rip up the entire withdrawal agreement; and said he would tackle the Irish border \u201con the other side of 31 October during what\u2019s called the implementation period\u201d, but then was forced to agree the UK would not get an implementation period without the withdrawal agreement. * * * Sweaty times \u2013 It is going to feel like 47C in parts of Europe as an unprecedented week-long heatwave rolls across the continent. Meteorologists say temperatures will soar from Spain to Switzerland as hot air is sucked up from the Sahara by a storm stalling over the Atlantic and high pressure over central Europe. Officials in Paris have set up \u201ccool rooms\u201d in municipal buildings, opened pools for late-night swimming, installed extra drinking fountains and postponed school exams. Temperatures in the French capital reached 34C on Monday and that\u2019s just the start. France\u2019s deadliest recent heatwave was in August 2003 when almost 15,000 mainly elderly people died as hospitals were overwhelmed. * * * Roof over Archie\u2019s head \u2013 Frogmore Cottage cost the British taxpayer \u00a32.4m to renovate so Harry, Meghan and Archie could live there, accounts reveal. The 18th century Grade-II listed house \u2013 which is actually rather large and uncottagey-looking \u2013 is close to Windsor Castle. The bill included work to convert the five apartments in the building back into one single dwelling, which is now the couple\u2019s official residence since they left Kensington Palace to set up their own royal household. Defective ceiling beams and floor joists need doing, as well as upgrades to the heating, power, gas and water. * * * \u2018Someone knows who she is\u2019 \u2013 A woman posed as the aunt of a cyclist who was killed in London to speak at a meeting against plans for a new segregated bike lane, according to the victim\u2019s mother.

The constitution of the Adamstown Rosebud tennis club in Newcastle, New South Wales, only allows men to become members, which, until recently, meant women could not access a \u201cheavily discounted\u201d member rate when booking courts. Local tennis player and coach Emma Pollock raised the issue with the council late last year, after she discovered male players had access to discounts and other membership rights not extended to women. Pollock said she \u201cwas extremely disappointed that this blatant gender inequality still exists in this day and age\u201d. The City of Newcastle, which owns the courts the club uses, has written to the club and said it must amend its constitution to give women \u201cthe same status, rights and obligations as male members\u201d. It said the club\u2019s discriminatory policies were a breach of its own licence agreement with the council, and if unchanged, it would not renew the club\u2019s licence. Since the initial complaint, the club has offered its discount rate to everyone \u2013 but has still not allowed women to become members. Tennis Australia said the Adamstown Rosebud club\u2019s rules \u201cclearly breaches\u201d national policies and it was an \u201cunacceptable situation\u201d. \u201cAffiliated organisations must not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, age, sexual orientation, ability, religion or any other protected characteristic,\u201d a spokeswoman said. \u201cTennis has a long history as one of the most inclusive and welcoming sports.\u201d A representative of the Adamstown Rosebud tennis club said: \u201cWe are working with council to resolve the issue, and that will happen in due course.\u201d Newcastle council also sent a letter to the club on Friday, saying its policy was \u201cnot acceptable\u201d, breached the council\u2019s own rules and potentially the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977. \u201cIt has been brought to the attention of CN [City of Newcastle] that the tennis club\u2019s constitution only allows for male members and precludes female members,\u201d the council wrote. \u201cThis is not acceptable to CN as it does not accord with the values of equity and non-discrimination which CN promotes internally and in the community.\u201d On Tuesday, a council spokesman said the club had until 5 July to present a proposed amendment to an extraordinary general meeting, or its lease would not be renewed. \u201cEarlier this year the club changed its pricing structure, in response to subsequent approaches by the city, to extend the discount to casual users of the courts,\u201d the council said. \u201cBut its refusal to date to amend its constitution to allow women to become members is considered unacceptable by the City of Newcastle on the basis that its facilities are public assets.\u201d",

And that woman is me.</p> <h2><strong>An adorable electronic barista</strong></h2> <p>I began my day with a coffee at CafeX, where I met Francisco, the dancing and spinning robotic arm. He was perhaps the friendliest barista I have ever encountered in San Francisco, a city where coffee is an art form and those behind the counter the intimidating artists.</p> <p>He sat behind glass, his human minders never far away, twirling and wiggling and engaging passersby. CafeX has been at the Metreon shopping center since 2017, but Francisco\u2019s antics still drew crowds. Tourists flocked around the sleek case to take pictures and videos of the robot in action, many putting in orders just to watch Francisco work. \u201cThis is a machine making drinks?\u201d one woman asked Francisco\u2019s minder. \u201cNo humans? Oh my God.\u201d</p> <p>Francisco offered the same high-quality options as most other coffee shops, allowing the customer the choice between Intelligentsia, Ritual and Equator coffee beans, and the choice between local organic Clover milk or a Swedish oat milk. My $5.20 iced mocha came out without any problem, and as I watched him prepare it, I realized that as futuristic as Francisco appeared, much of what he did was akin to the work of an automated espresso machine at the local 7-Eleven. Mind you, the drink that he passed to me through the drink hole was much higher quality than your typical automated espresso machine drink, but for all his showmanship and pizzazz, all he really did was push a button.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"462d23887a381e42d6cebca49e930ec2a9bf5470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/462d23887a381e42d6cebca49e930ec2a9bf5470/0_0_4717_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Francisco, the robot, offered the same high-quality options as most other coffee shops.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francisco the robot offered the same high-quality options as most other coffee shops would.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But oh, how he pushed that button! This robotic arm was no barista; he was a performer. Francisco would brace forward like a puppy at play, waggling his claw back and forth. Within minutes, I had grown attached to this robotic arm, this little engine that could, this piece of unfeeling metal with heart. I forgave him all mistakes, which was good because there were indeed mistakes.</p> <p>I put in an order for a $4.16 iced matcha latte, but instead of presenting me a beautiful vessel of milky green liquid, Francisco plopped some green goo into the bottom of a cup and called it a day.

In the infinite wars of humans v robots, humans clearly won at Creator. Human staff greet you at the door to take your order. Human chefs created the menu items.

This is not the place to go to if your reason for partaking in automated food service is to avoid humans, because during my visit, humans packed the space in anxiety-inducing numbers. They crowded the machines to watch the burger form in a conveyor-belt sequence, from the cutting and toasting and saucing of the bun, to the slicing and placing of the vegetables, to the shredding and melting of the cheese, and finally to the placing of the patty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f6a238b3f2d56e466efe5c1a0ef36d91ca414f93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6a238b3f2d56e466efe5c1a0ef36d91ca414f93/0_0_2337_3000/779.jpg\" alt=\"Two machines service the restaurant, one behind the counter and one to the side of the counter, for easier viewing purposes.\" width=\"779\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two machines service the restaurant, one behind the counter and one to the side of the counter, for easier viewing purposes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two machines service the restaurant, one behind the counter and one to the side of the counter, for easier viewing purposes. I asked if the staff had named their robots, the first in the world to make burgers, and was firmly told that they do not anthropomorphize their machines. These machines were no Francisco \u2013 they were culinary devices. Every action had a purpose, such as when the vegetables were sliced \u2013 some research says that sliced onions taste bitter if they sit sliced for too long, so the machine freshly chops off a sliver of an onion for each burger. Nothing is flipping or twirling for our entertainment here.</p> <p>Then again, these machines aren\u2019t just pushing a button. Behind them are screens of complicated code and a station with laptops and keyboards and human beings to make sure everything is going well. And the burgers that the machines create are leagues better than some burgers I\u2019ve tasted that were crafted by humans. The beef is juicy and well-seasoned, and the variety of recipes created by the human chefs has each burger hitting diverse flavor notes that manage to scratch the same itch you want to scratch when you seek out a burger. I inhaled almost all of my favorite, the Tumami Burger ($6.07) before remembering that I had two other burgers to try in front of me \u2013 after which I had two other favorites, the Recreator ($6.07) and the Mission Street Food Burger ($7.07). Everything feels fresh with these burgers, from the beef to the sauces to the vegetables, so that it almost defies belief that it came from a machine.</p> <h2><strong>Burned by robot ramen</strong></h2> <p>I returned to the Metreon for my third stop of the day, Yo-Kai Express, the vending machine that serves piping hot ramen noodles. For the first time, I had a machine with no human minder, and it felt daunting. I ordered through a touchpad screen, which flashed what felt like far too many warnings about how the ramen was going to be hot, and patiently awaited the 30 seconds for my $13.07 black oil garlic ramen to arrive.</p> <p>To my dismay, the machine presented the ramen to me<strong> </strong>in a semi-sealed container, under a red plastic lid winking proudly up at me like an orifice meant to dispel waste. It was akin to seeing all the individual parts that go into a sausage before they\u2019re ground up into mush.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f6f40ef8269436c48e6f37dd07bdcee7259f3675\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6f40ef8269436c48e6f37dd07bdcee7259f3675/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yo-Kai Express at the Metreon in downtown San Francisco.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yo-Kai Express at the Metreon in downtown San Francisco.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> </p> <p>Just as the machine had warned me, the ramen was, indeed, very hot. I could barely carry it from the machine to the table without fearing I\u2019d sear off my fingerprints. And it was pretty much at this point that I had had enough of the soup. I took off the offensive lid and found the soup covered in two layers of plastic. I slurped some of the sodium-heavy broth and uninspired noodles, and moped under a heavy cloud of disappointment. For good measure, I popped a piece of the chewy pork into my mouth as well before I tossed the majority of the bowl. From his location just feet away, Francisco waved merrily as I skulked off in disappointment.</p> <h2><strong>The tea that never was</strong></h2> <p>I needed a palate cleanser after all that, but instead I found the robot that never was. Encountering TeaBOT was similar to walking into a fully stocked store during store hours only to find nobody inside but you. I came across the automated cart-sized robot to find its credit card machine working but the touchpad screen to put in an order completely black.</p> <p>Tea leaves filled the clear cylinders overhead enticingly, under labels advertising yerba mate, masala chai, jasmine, sencha, chamomile and rooibos. The special lids made for filtering tea sat ready for the taking in a side chamber. Everything seemed prepared for a customer, yet nothing could take my order. \u201cShould I unplug it?\u201d I wondered. </p> <p>The company\u2019s website still lists the San Francisco location as operational, but it clearly was not. Who knows. Maybe it was taking a sick day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"94c7b94027391327674a3d79115eebd2c825e492\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94c7b94027391327674a3d79115eebd2c825e492/0_0_3000_2250/1000.jpg\" alt=\"TeaBOT, the automated cart-sized robot that makes tea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">TeaBOT, the automated cart-sized robot that makes tea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cayce Clifford/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>A perfect baguette</strong></h2> <p>After my ramen disaster, I was expecting the worst from the bread vending machine, located in a mall in the far south-west corner of the city. Instead, I found a crisp, fluffy baguette, similar to one I\u2019d buy from a grocery store.</p> <p>The machine holds a limited number of baguettes per day, and I chanced upon the second-to-last baguette of the day. I inserted my card, and for $4, I received a warm \u2013 not scalding, ramen hot \u2013 toasty, perfect baguette. I immediately ripped a chunk out of the loaf as I walked away, and I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of it all. Bread, in particular, could go wrong so easily, but the crust had a good crunch to it while the middle maintained that cloud-soft fluff.</p> <p>My only problem with the baguette was that it wasn\u2019t near an automated robot butter vending machine, or a strawberry jam culinary device, or a Francisco that twirled up a perfect cheese-and-charcuterie plate. I\u2019m guessing this machine is not meant for writers pulling stunts like only eating robot-prepared foods all day, but bread alone can get dull.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/mar/07/food-tech-the-march-of-the-robots-reaches-the-kitchen\">Restaurants are now employing robots \u2013 should chefs be worried?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Extraordinarily all right pizza</strong></h2> <p>My last stop of the day took me out of San Francisco to Mountain View, home of Google.

      "bodyText": "Around the world, an industry has emerged around automating food service through robotics, raising questions about job security and mass unemployment while also prompting praise for streamlining and innovation. In the epicenter of Silicon Valley, where innovation is exalted beyond all else, this industry has played out in various forms, from cafes, burger shops and pizza delivery to odd vending machines. Man cannot survive on bread alone, the saying goes, but in the Bay Area, a woman could conceivably sustain herself on a varied menu of foodstuffs that had not passed the hand of man in preparation at all that day. And that woman is me. An adorable electronic barista I began my day with a coffee at CafeX, where I met Francisco, the dancing and spinning robotic arm. He was perhaps the friendliest barista I have ever encountered in San Francisco, a city where coffee is an art form and those behind the counter the intimidating artists. He sat behind glass, his human minders never far away, twirling and wiggling and engaging passersby. CafeX has been at the Metreon shopping center since 2017, but Francisco\u2019s antics still drew crowds. Tourists flocked around the sleek case to take pictures and videos of the robot in action, many putting in orders just to watch Francisco work. \u201cThis is a machine making drinks?\u201d one woman asked Francisco\u2019s minder. \u201cNo humans? Oh my God.\u201d Francisco offered the same high-quality options as most other coffee shops, allowing the customer the choice between Intelligentsia, Ritual and Equator coffee beans, and the choice between local organic Clover milk or a Swedish oat milk. My $5.20 iced mocha came out without any problem, and as I watched him prepare it, I realized that as futuristic as Francisco appeared, much of what he did was akin to the work of an automated espresso machine at the local 7-Eleven. Mind you, the drink that he passed to me through the drink hole was much higher quality than your typical automated espresso machine drink, but for all his showmanship and pizzazz, all he really did was push a button. But oh, how he pushed that button! This robotic arm was no barista; he was a performer. Francisco would brace forward like a puppy at play, waggling his claw back and forth. Within minutes, I had grown attached to this robotic arm, this little engine that could, this piece of unfeeling metal with heart. I forgave him all mistakes, which was good because there were indeed mistakes. I put in an order for a $4.16 iced matcha latte, but instead of presenting me a beautiful vessel of milky green liquid, Francisco plopped some green goo into the bottom of a cup and called it a day. Francisco\u2019s human minders rushed into action, opening up the door into his glass chamber. I asked what they were doing, and they told me they were deploying the most common fix-all when it comes to technology, which was turning him off and on again. On the second go-around, Francisco put too much ice into the cup, and one of the human minders apologetically brought over a more presentable drink. I asked one of the minders if she had ever gotten attached to Francisco like I had gotten attached to him, and she looked at me as if I had asked her if she had ever developed feelings for an inanimate object. Inhaling a bot-made burger Our second stop of the day brought us to Creator, where a robot makes your burger, but that\u2019s pretty much the only thing they do. In the infinite wars of humans v robots, humans clearly won at Creator. Human staff greet you at the door to take your order. Human chefs created the menu items. Humans even make the french fries, side salads and side vegetables. But as at CafeX, the draw of a robot has people lining out the door to get into the restaurant. This is not the place to go to if your reason for partaking in automated food service is to avoid humans, because during my visit, humans packed the space in anxiety-inducing numbers. They crowded the machines to watch the burger form in a conveyor-belt sequence, from the cutting and toasting and saucing of the bun, to the slicing and placing of the vegetables, to the shredding and melting of the cheese, and finally to the placing of the patty. Two machines service the restaurant, one behind the counter and one to the side of the counter, for easier viewing purposes. I asked if the staff had named their robots, the first in the world to make burgers, and was firmly told that they do not anthropomorphize their machines. These machines were no Francisco \u2013 they were culinary devices. Every action had a purpose, such as when the vegetables were sliced \u2013 some research says that sliced onions taste bitter if they sit sliced for too long, so the machine freshly chops off a sliver of an onion for each burger. Nothing is flipping or twirling for our entertainment here. Then again, these machines aren\u2019t just pushing a button. Behind them are screens of complicated code and a station with laptops and keyboards and human beings to make sure everything is going well. And the burgers that the machines create are leagues better than some burgers I\u2019ve tasted that were crafted by humans. The beef is juicy and well-seasoned, and the variety of recipes created by the human chefs has each burger hitting diverse flavor notes that manage to scratch the same itch you want to scratch when you seek out a burger.

Everything feels fresh with these burgers, from the beef to the sauces to the vegetables, so that it almost defies belief that it came from a machine. Burned by robot ramen I returned to the Metreon for my third stop of the day, Yo-Kai Express, the vending machine that serves piping hot ramen noodles. For the first time, I had a machine with no human minder, and it felt daunting. I ordered through a touchpad screen, which flashed what felt like far too many warnings about how the ramen was going to be hot, and patiently awaited the 30 seconds for my $13.07 black oil garlic ramen to arrive.

The company\u2019s website still lists the San Francisco location as operational, but it clearly was not. Who knows. Maybe it was taking a sick day. A perfect baguette After my ramen disaster, I was expecting the worst from the bread vending machine, located in a mall in the far south-west corner of the city. Instead, I found a crisp, fluffy baguette, similar to one I\u2019d buy from a grocery store. The machine holds a limited number of baguettes per day, and I chanced upon the second-to-last baguette of the day. I inserted my card, and for $4, I received a warm \u2013 not scalding, ramen hot \u2013 toasty, perfect baguette. I immediately ripped a chunk out of the loaf as I walked away, and I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness of it all. Bread, in particular, could go wrong so easily, but the crust had a good crunch to it while the middle maintained that cloud-soft fluff.

I\u2019m guessing this machine is not meant for writers pulling stunts like only eating robot-prepared foods all day, but bread alone can get dull. Extraordinarily all right pizza My last stop of the day took me out of San Francisco to Mountain View, home of Google. It was also the only point of the day where I questioned whether a robot was actually involved in the preparation process at all.

I\u2019ve never seen more liars in one room!\u201d</p> <p>Channel controllers take note \u2013 after all, nobody understands reality TV quite like Clark-Neal. The 30-year-old first came to most people\u2019s attention in 2012 as an outrageously camp contestant on ITV\u2019s The X Factor who couldn\u2019t really sing, but had a talent for annoying the judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/gary-barlow\" title=\"\">Gary Barlow</a> (and charming viewers in the process). A triumphant turn on Channel 5\u2019s Celebrity Big Brother followed, which led to a presenter\u2019s gig on the spin-off show, Big Brother\u2019s Bit on the Side, then a stint as a showbiz reporter on ITV\u2019s This Morning. Having completed a remarkable journey from national joke to national treasure, he can be heard in our front rooms in the Saturday afternoon BBC Radio 2 slot previously occupied by Zoe Ball. He says he has to pinch himself daily.</p> <p>\u201cYesterday I went to interview Madonna; tonight I\u2019m going to the Spice Girls, because Geri got me a ticket,\u201d he says, by way of explaining his dreams coming true. Or, to put it another way: \u201cBasically, 10-year-old me is having a wank.\u201d</p> <p>Today we are sitting in a quiet meeting room overlooking Regent\u2019s canal in London. Clark-Neal, who admits that he spent the photoshoot grilling the photographer about who would be interviewing him (\u201cI needed to check you weren\u2019t an arsehole\u201d), gleams so brightly that you worry about staring directly at him: not just because of the bright-white veneers, which cost him \u00a325,000 in 2013, but thanks to the brilliant-blue eyes, too. He is funny \u2013 outspoken and outrageous. Yet there is a steeliness and seriousness to him (not to mention a sweariness). After years of doing staged showbiz interviews full of made-up anecdotes, there is a sense of catharsis to his conversation: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be honest for a change,\u201d he says, before talking about his early years being bullied, the time off he took at the end of 2017 and the dawning realisation that fame hasn\u2019t turned out to be all he had hoped.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"72b33c0c052cf7e0d7597e084c862e203fddd1be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72b33c0c052cf7e0d7597e084c862e203fddd1be/0_526_2819_3522/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rylan Clark-Neal with Nicole Scherzinger on The X Factor\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark-Neal with Nicole Scherzinger on The X Factor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/Thames/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Recently, he has turned his attention to another serious matter, one that may surprise those who know him best as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q86Zpx6VkBA\" title=\"\">the X Factor contestant </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q86Zpx6VkBA\" title=\"\">who had a histrionic meltdown when Nicole Scherzinger told him she was putting him through to the live finals</a>. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">I\u2019m obsessed with Brexit</a>,\u201d he says. Then, to prove his political knowledge, he performs an unlikely impression of the Labour MP Dawn Butler telling the Tory front bench to shush (\u201cShe\u2019s my favourite; she lets the MP mask slip\u201d).</p> <p>Earlier this year <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rylan/status/1110993764431073284\" title=\"\">he tweeted about Theresa May\u2019s third meaningful vote</a>, only to be met with a barrage of mockery from political journalists. He responded by offering to \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/Rylan/status/1110995456392335360\" title=\"\">Brexit talk anyone under the table</a>\u201d. In response, he says, \u201c90% of them deleted their tweets ... because I would come for them. You want to get people into politics and you think taking the piss is the way to do it?\u201d</p> <p>So, what is his analysis of the Brexit impasse?</p> <p>\u201cThat all roads lead to shit. Every single possible outcome will cause riots. Whatever your position, whatever you voted, even if you get what you want, it\u2019s still gonna be shit.\u201d</p> <p>Could he do a better job?</p> <p>\u201cI often think I could do a better job. Honestly, there are harder decisions to make during a series of Celebrity Big Brother than the ones they\u2019re having to make.\u201d</p> <p>Clark-Neal credits his time in Big Brother with changing the public\u2019s perception of him \u2013 \u201cthey realised I was normal\u201d \u2013 and his adoration goes so deep that he has modelled his house on the set. Apparently, there are Big Brother \u201ceyes\u201d above each door and the garden has been landscaped by people who worked on the show. Sadly, he says: \u201cThe only place I\u2019ve ever felt safe is the Big Brother house.\u201d His house even has a diary room for him to sit in. What does he do in there?</p> <p>\u201cThink,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd talk.\u201d</p> <p>To whom?</p> <p>\u201cI can make someone listen if I want to.\u201d</p> <p>Really? How?</p> <p>\u201cI can set it up so other people in the house can listen ... if I want them to.\u201d He looks slightly bashful. \u201cI live in quite a smart home. I built it from scratch, so I thought of everything ... a lot of my doors are automatic; the whole house is voice-activated.\u201d</p> <p>The other day, his wifi went down. He is a little embarrassed to admit that he had forgotten how to turn on the lights like a normal person. \u201cI was pressing random buttons and screaming for Alexa to help.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q86Zpx6VkBA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Q86Zpx6VkBA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>\u2018You only saw a bit of the crying.

There follows an amusing conversation revolving around Cameron trying to access the house\u2019s steam room. \u201cIf you go for a swim, be careful of the robot \u2013 it\u2019s on a cleaning cycle. Oh, and dry the floor after yourself!\u201d</p> <p>How does he find being a stepdad?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the same as being a normal dad. He rinses me dry, I slap him about when he\u2019s naughty ... no, I don\u2019t, obviously \u2026 but it\u2019s the same as being a biological dad. He lives with us. I moan at him to clean up, he cleans up ... he cuts the grass, I give him some money ... it\u2019s just very normal.\u201d</p> <p>Clark-Neal describes himself as the man in the middle \u2013 there are 10 years between he and both Dan and Cameron \u2013 but the closeness in age helps him with some difficult conversations. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about sex with Cameron, but I can,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do warn him \u2013 if you make me a grandad at 30, I\u2019ll cut it off.\u201d</p> <p>Would he like more children?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I often think I could do a better job of Brexit.

But Dan\u2019s done it all now, whereas I haven\u2019t. So \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Clark-Neal was born Ross Richard Clark in 1988, raised by his mum and his nan in a council house in Stepney Green, east London. He says his childhood was a happy, normal one, but he was bullied: \u201cOf course I was \u2013 I was a chubby, ginger, gay kid: all I needed was a set of glasses for the full fucking set.\u201d</p> <p>There was a real community spirit on his street, but his mum moved the family to Essex after he was attacked at a local playground and put in hospital with a fractured skull. \u201cProbably because they thought I was gay, although I don\u2019t remember any of it. One minute I was on the rope swings, the next I was on the floor.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/08/london-bus-attack-fifth-arrest-after-homophobic-assault\" title=\"\">Seeing two women bloodied and beaten in the news recently</a> after an attack on a London bus, alleged to have been motivated by homophobia, didn\u2019t surprise him: \u201cI saw all the statuses saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening in 2019,\u2019 but every day on my Twitter feed I\u2019ll get: \u2018You\u2019re gay, you\u2019re a cunt, people like you should be killed because you\u2019re gay.\u2019 Will things ever change?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1028e77df089a96c52d79c1ee3cfbf6c636da060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1028e77df089a96c52d79c1ee3cfbf6c636da060/0_0_3456_4592/753.jpg\" alt=\"Rylan Clark-Neal with his husband, Dan Neal, on This Morning in 2017\" width=\"753\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Would I like more children?

Clark-Neal with his husband, Dan Neal, on This Morning in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his teens, Clark-Neal dabbled in modelling, changing his name from Ross to Rylan to be more recognisable. He performed in boyband tribute acts, then signed up to The X Factor. But he doesn\u2019t like looking back on that period of his life.</p> <p>\u201cI played a character when I was on there,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I had to be the gay stereotype that was on the front of the papers every day. And I did my job well. I played the game.\u201d</p> <p>Does this mean that his hysterical crying in front of Scherzinger was all an act?</p> <p>\u201cNo, that was true,\u201d he says. \u201cBut only because we were drinking in the pool until about 7am and it was 50-degree heat and I\u2019d had an hour\u2019s sleep. I knew I only needed a week on the live shows to earn a bit of money and set myself up for a while. But you only saw a bit of the crying. It went on for 45 minutes and they had to call a paramedic. I couldn\u2019t breathe!\u201d</p> <p>Clark-Neal says he watches the infamous clip once a year, just to remind himself how much it all means. He loves his job and he has worked ridiculously hard for it \u2013 possibly too much, at times. He recalls the day his nan died. They were incredibly close, but he still chose to present Big Brother\u2019s Bit on the Side that night. \u201cIt was either that or sit indoors crying,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I cried, went into work, had another cry, did an hour\u2019s live show, then cried and went home. It\u2019s just how I am ... always at work, never stop.\u201d</p> <p>Does he worry that he is using work to deal with deeper stuff?</p> <p>\u201cOne hundred per cent. But I know my nan would have said: \u2018Go to work.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When Clark-Neal first found fame, he lived the celebrity cliches \u2013 even buying a customised Range Rover with the silver lettering changed to Range Rylan. But, he says, he misjudged what fame would bring. Even interviewing Madonna, he says he found himself getting mobbed more than the queen of pop. \u201cNot because I\u2019m more recognisable. I\u2019m not under any illusion that I\u2019m an A-lister; I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even on the alphabet scale. But I\u2019m in people\u2019s houses every day \u2013 I\u2019m there when they wake up and there when they go to bed. So people think they know who I am. And, to a certain extent, they do.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As much as I\u2019m grateful for it, fame is the one thing I wish I didn\u2019t have</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Listen to his show and it is clear why strangers view him as a friend: he is warm, witty and gets his mum to phone in and natter on about ham and cheese toasties. Still, isn\u2019t it a bit rich complaining about fame when he went all-out in search of it?</p> <p>\u201cIn the early days, it was all I ever wanted, more than the job,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted people to know who I was. But now, much as I\u2019m grateful for it, it\u2019s the one thing I wish I didn\u2019t have. Because I don\u2019t leave my house. If I walk down the street, people will come up. And I can\u2019t just go: \u2018Get lost,\u2019 because I\u2019m not an arsehole.\u201d</p> <p>He recalls a family wedding the other week \u2013 lovely people, great conversation. Then the evening approached. \u201cThat\u2019s when it started,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who\u2019d been there all day started asking for photos. It\u2019s that constant reminder that: \u2018Oh shit, you\u2019re Rylan.\u2019 I\u2019ve lost a lot of friends over it. Especially in telly, I\u2019ve got one handful of people I can cry down the phone to and know it\u2019s between us.\u201d</p> <p>These days, he says, 90% of the people he meets are nice. After The X Factor, he got abuse, but if anyone tries that these days: \u201cI\u2019ll tell them to screw themselves. People might think I don\u2019t have that in me.\u201d</p> <p>The Range Rylan had to go \u2013 too many eagle-eyed drivers started driving alongside him with cameras out, causing him to panic at the wheel. But he blames himself: \u201cI sold my soul,\u201d he says. \u201cI went on X Factor and sold my soul \u2026 to the <em>beast</em>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3df5f25049efd28e110caff36e6aa96cfd06dcb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3df5f25049efd28e110caff36e6aa96cfd06dcb3/0_0_2215_2768/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rylan Clark-Neal winning Celebrity Big Brother in 2013\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clark-Neal winning Celebrity Big Brother in 2013.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wonder how he feels about reality TV in today\u2019s climate, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/15/itv-axes-jeremy-kyle-show-after-death-of-participant\" title=\"\">The Jeremy Kyle </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/15/itv-axes-jeremy-kyle-show-after-death-of-participant\" title=\"\">Show has been axed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/03/they-sell-you-a-dream-are-reality-shows-such-as-love-island-failing-contestants\" title=\"\">Love Island heavily criticised</a> after people who had starred in the programmes had mental health problems and even killed themselves. Clark-Neal thinks the main problem is the way fame ends suddenly once you leave the shows. \u201cThe second you walk out, you are on your own. I was very lucky. After the X Factor tour, I went back home \u2026 it was the first time I\u2019d been in a room on my own for eight months, without anyone watching me. I remember waking up at 4am and thinking: \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 If the phone hadn\u2019t rung with the Big Brother job a few weeks later, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, he has worked so much that at the end of 2017 he stepped back from his gig on This Morning to look after his mental health. He says he was getting up at 5am most days and not getting home until 2am. He was also struggling to deal with other problems, particularly his mum\u2019s worsening health as a result of Crohn\u2019s disease. Yet the decision drew criticism from some. \u201cI remember seeing tweets from people saying: \u2018Who do you think you are? I\u2019ve worked for the NHS for 25 years and I\u2019m not in a position to have time off.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cBut then other people will say: \u2018I never knew your mum nearly died, or was linked up to an IV drip six nights a week because she can\u2019t digest food any more.\u2019 And that\u2019s because I don\u2019t go on telly and every magazine going: \u2018Poor me, my mum\u2019s not well, now give me a tenner for the interview.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cLife is complicated,\u201d he concludes, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got a set of veneers that I smile through on morning TV.\u201d</p> <p>After sharing his feelings about always being on duty, I feel guilty when the interview ends and I, too, ask for a favour. But my wife\u2019s grandma, who has been ill, is a huge fan, so \u2026 if he wouldn\u2019t mind \u2026 could he just do a little video message?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d</p> <p>Mildred, I say.</p> <p>\u201cOf course it is.\u201d</p> <p>He whisks my phone from my hand and starts recording: \u201cHi Mildred, it\u2019s Rylan, I hope you\u2019re well. A little birdie tells me that you listen to my radio show. Thank you, because it\u2019s nice to meet one of the three listeners. I hear you\u2019ve had a few little issues, so I\u2019m sending you all my love. And whenever you want to come to visit Radio 2, let me know.\u201d</p> <p>It is nothing special, really, just a video message for someone he has never met \u2013 one of dozens he will no doubt do in the next few days. But it is so effortlessly sweet that I realise why he can\u2019t walk down the street without being approached. And I think: whatever it was he sold to the beast, he definitely kept some of it back.</p> <ul> <li><p>This article was amended on 25 June 2019 to clarify that Clark-Neal\u2019s show on BBC Radio 2 is permanent. Previously, it said he was standing in for Zoe Ball.</p></li> </ul>",

Clark-Neal, who admits that he spent the photoshoot grilling the photographer about who would be interviewing him (\u201cI needed to check you weren\u2019t an arsehole\u201d), gleams so brightly that you worry about staring directly at him: not just because of the bright-white veneers, which cost him \u00a325,000 in 2013, but thanks to the brilliant-blue eyes, too. He is funny \u2013 outspoken and outrageous. Yet there is a steeliness and seriousness to him (not to mention a sweariness). After years of doing staged showbiz interviews full of made-up anecdotes, there is a sense of catharsis to his conversation: \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be honest for a change,\u201d he says, before talking about his early years being bullied, the time off he took at the end of 2017 and the dawning realisation that fame hasn\u2019t turned out to be all he had hoped. Recently, he has turned his attention to another serious matter, one that may surprise those who know him best as the X Factor contestant who had a histrionic meltdown when Nicole Scherzinger told him she was putting him through to the live finals. \u201cI\u2019m obsessed with Brexit,\u201d he says. Then, to prove his political knowledge, he performs an unlikely impression of the Labour MP Dawn Butler telling the Tory front bench to shush (\u201cShe\u2019s my favourite; she lets the MP mask slip\u201d). Earlier this year he tweeted about Theresa May\u2019s third meaningful vote, only to be met with a barrage of mockery from political journalists. He responded by offering to \u201cBrexit talk anyone under the table\u201d. In response, he says, \u201c90% of them deleted their tweets ... because I would come for them. You want to get people into politics and you think taking the piss is the way to do it?\u201d So, what is his analysis of the Brexit impasse? \u201cThat all roads lead to shit. Every single possible outcome will cause riots. Whatever your position, whatever you voted, even if you get what you want, it\u2019s still gonna be shit.\u201d Could he do a better job? \u201cI often think I could do a better job. Honestly, there are harder decisions to make during a series of Celebrity Big Brother than the ones they\u2019re having to make.\u201d Clark-Neal credits his time in Big Brother with changing the public\u2019s perception of him \u2013 \u201cthey realised I was normal\u201d \u2013 and his adoration goes so deep that he has modelled his house on the set. Apparently, there are Big Brother \u201ceyes\u201d above each door and the garden has been landscaped by people who worked on the show. Sadly, he says: \u201cThe only place I\u2019ve ever felt safe is the Big Brother house.\u201d His house even has a diary room for him to sit in. What does he do in there? \u201cThink,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd talk.\u201d To whom? \u201cI can make someone listen if I want to.\u201d Really? How? \u201cI can set it up so other people in the house can listen ... if I want them to.\u201d He looks slightly bashful. \u201cI live in quite a smart home. I built it from scratch, so I thought of everything ... a lot of my doors are automatic; the whole house is voice-activated.\u201d The other day, his wifi went down. He is a little embarrassed to admit that he had forgotten how to turn on the lights like a normal person. \u201cI was pressing random buttons and screaming for Alexa to help.\u201d As if to prove his hi-tech credentials, his watch suddenly starts buzzing to tell him his stepson, Cameron, is trying to call \u2013 in 2015, Clark-Neal married Dan Neal, a former police officer and Big Brother contestant, whose 19-year-old son now lives with them. \u201cDo you mind?\u201d he says, reaching for his phone. There follows an amusing conversation revolving around Cameron trying to access the house\u2019s steam room. \u201cIf you go for a swim, be careful of the robot \u2013 it\u2019s on a cleaning cycle. Oh, and dry the floor after yourself!\u201d How does he find being a stepdad? \u201cIt\u2019s the same as being a normal dad. He rinses me dry, I slap him about when he\u2019s naughty ... no, I don\u2019t, obviously \u2026 but it\u2019s the same as being a biological dad. He lives with us. I moan at him to clean up, he cleans up ... he cuts the grass, I give him some money ... it\u2019s just very normal.\u201d Clark-Neal describes himself as the man in the middle \u2013 there are 10 years between he and both Dan and Cameron \u2013 but the closeness in age helps him with some difficult conversations. \u201cI don\u2019t like to talk about sex with Cameron, but I can,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I do warn him \u2013 if you make me a grandad at 30, I\u2019ll cut it off.\u201d Would he like more children? \u201cIt\u2019s not something I really talk about \u2013 although it always ends up in the papers anyway. But Dan\u2019s done it all now, whereas I haven\u2019t. So \u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Clark-Neal was born Ross Richard Clark in 1988, raised by his mum and his nan in a council house in Stepney Green, east London. He says his childhood was a happy, normal one, but he was bullied: \u201cOf course I was \u2013 I was a chubby, ginger, gay kid: all I needed was a set of glasses for the full fucking set.\u201d There was a real community spirit on his street, but his mum moved the family to Essex after he was attacked at a local playground and put in hospital with a fractured skull. \u201cProbably because they thought I was gay, although I don\u2019t remember any of it. One minute I was on the rope swings, the next I was on the floor.\u201d Seeing two women bloodied and beaten in the news recently after an attack on a London bus, alleged to have been motivated by homophobia, didn\u2019t surprise him: \u201cI saw all the statuses saying: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this is happening in 2019,\u2019 but every day on my Twitter feed I\u2019ll get: \u2018You\u2019re gay, you\u2019re a cunt, people like you should be killed because you\u2019re gay.\u2019 Will things ever change?\u201d In his teens, Clark-Neal dabbled in modelling, changing his name from Ross to Rylan to be more recognisable. He performed in boyband tribute acts, then signed up to The X Factor. But he doesn\u2019t like looking back on that period of his life. \u201cI played a character when I was on there,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew I had to be the gay stereotype that was on the front of the papers every day. And I did my job well. I played the game.\u201d Does this mean that his hysterical crying in front of Scherzinger was all an act? \u201cNo, that was true,\u201d he says. \u201cBut only because we were drinking in the pool until about 7am and it was 50-degree heat and I\u2019d had an hour\u2019s sleep. I knew I only needed a week on the live shows to earn a bit of money and set myself up for a while. But you only saw a bit of the crying. It went on for 45 minutes and they had to call a paramedic. I couldn\u2019t breathe!\u201d Clark-Neal says he watches the infamous clip once a year, just to remind himself how much it all means. He loves his job and he has worked ridiculously hard for it \u2013 possibly too much, at times. He recalls the day his nan died. They were incredibly close, but he still chose to present Big Brother\u2019s Bit on the Side that night. \u201cIt was either that or sit indoors crying,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I cried, went into work, had another cry, did an hour\u2019s live show, then cried and went home. It\u2019s just how I am ... always at work, never stop.\u201d Does he worry that he is using work to deal with deeper stuff? \u201cOne hundred per cent. But I know my nan would have said: \u2018Go to work.\u2019\u201d When Clark-Neal first found fame, he lived the celebrity cliches \u2013 even buying a customised Range Rover with the silver lettering changed to Range Rylan. But, he says, he misjudged what fame would bring. Even interviewing Madonna, he says he found himself getting mobbed more than the queen of pop. \u201cNot because I\u2019m more recognisable. I\u2019m not under any illusion that I\u2019m an A-lister; I don\u2019t think I\u2019m even on the alphabet scale. But I\u2019m in people\u2019s houses every day \u2013 I\u2019m there when they wake up and there when they go to bed. So people think they know who I am. And, to a certain extent, they do.\u201d Listen to his show and it is clear why strangers view him as a friend: he is warm, witty and gets his mum to phone in and natter on about ham and cheese toasties. Still, isn\u2019t it a bit rich complaining about fame when he went all-out in search of it? \u201cIn the early days, it was all I ever wanted, more than the job,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted people to know who I was. But now, much as I\u2019m grateful for it, it\u2019s the one thing I wish I didn\u2019t have. Because I don\u2019t leave my house. If I walk down the street, people will come up. And I can\u2019t just go: \u2018Get lost,\u2019 because I\u2019m not an arsehole.\u201d He recalls a family wedding the other week \u2013 lovely people, great conversation. Then the evening approached. \u201cThat\u2019s when it started,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who\u2019d been there all day started asking for photos. It\u2019s that constant reminder that: \u2018Oh shit, you\u2019re Rylan.\u2019 I\u2019ve lost a lot of friends over it. Especially in telly, I\u2019ve got one handful of people I can cry down the phone to and know it\u2019s between us.\u201d These days, he says, 90% of the people he meets are nice. After The X Factor, he got abuse, but if anyone tries that these days: \u201cI\u2019ll tell them to screw themselves. People might think I don\u2019t have that in me.\u201d The Range Rylan had to go \u2013 too many eagle-eyed drivers started driving alongside him with cameras out, causing him to panic at the wheel. But he blames himself: \u201cI sold my soul,\u201d he says. \u201cI went on X Factor and sold my soul \u2026 to the beast.\u201d I wonder how he feels about reality TV in today\u2019s climate, in which The Jeremy Kyle Show has been axed and Love Island heavily criticised after people who had starred in the programmes had mental health problems and even killed themselves. Clark-Neal thinks the main problem is the way fame ends suddenly once you leave the shows. \u201cThe second you walk out, you are on your own. I was very lucky. After the X Factor tour, I went back home \u2026 it was the first time I\u2019d been in a room on my own for eight months, without anyone watching me. I remember waking up at 4am and thinking: \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 If the phone hadn\u2019t rung with the Big Brother job a few weeks later, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d have done.\u201d In fact, he has worked so much that at the end of 2017 he stepped back from his gig on This Morning to look after his mental health. He says he was getting up at 5am most days and not getting home until 2am. He was also struggling to deal with other problems, particularly his mum\u2019s worsening health as a result of Crohn\u2019s disease. Yet the decision drew criticism from some. \u201cI remember seeing tweets from people saying: \u2018Who do you think you are? I\u2019ve worked for the NHS for 25 years and I\u2019m not in a position to have time off.\u2019 \u201cBut then other people will say: \u2018I never knew your mum nearly died, or was linked up to an IV drip six nights a week because she can\u2019t digest food any more.\u2019 And that\u2019s because I don\u2019t go on telly and every magazine going: \u2018Poor me, my mum\u2019s not well, now give me a tenner for the interview.\u2019 \u201cLife is complicated,\u201d he concludes, \u201cbut I\u2019ve got a set of veneers that I smile through on morning TV.\u201d After sharing his feelings about always being on duty, I feel guilty when the interview ends and I, too, ask for a favour. But my wife\u2019s grandma, who has been ill, is a huge fan, so \u2026 if he wouldn\u2019t mind \u2026 could he just do a little video message? \u201cI\u2019d love to,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d Mildred, I say. \u201cOf course it is.\u201d He whisks my phone from my hand and starts recording: \u201cHi Mildred, it\u2019s Rylan, I hope you\u2019re well. A little birdie tells me that you listen to my radio show. Thank you, because it\u2019s nice to meet one of the three listeners. I hear you\u2019ve had a few little issues, so I\u2019m sending you all my love. And whenever you want to come to visit Radio 2, let me know.\u201d It is nothing special, really, just a video message for someone he has never met \u2013 one of dozens he will no doubt do in the next few days. But it is so effortlessly sweet that I realise why he can\u2019t walk down the street without being approached. And I think: whatever it was he sold to the beast, he definitely kept some of it back. This article was amended on 25 June 2019 to clarify that Clark-Neal\u2019s show on BBC Radio 2 is permanent. Previously, it said he was standing in for Zoe Ball.",

Find out now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>California required that brominated flame retardants be sprayed into furniture going back to the 1970s, and the law only changed in 2013. In Europe, these chemicals were banned much sooner, producing an entire generation of children with much lower levels of chemicals that disrupt thyroid hormone, which is crucial for healthy brain development. In the US, the average American has levels that would be in the 95th percentile of Europeans or anyone else in the world for that matter. That\u2019s why brominated flame retardants cost the US over $266bn each year, while in Europe those same chemicals cost only $13bn.</p> <p>The frightening part of that story is how literally chemical exposures can undermine our competitive advantage with other countries, undermining our educational talent. And, these economic estimates don\u2019t include the costs of having fewer children with genius IQs. The researchers only measured the costs of children who were pushed into the intellectually disabled range. The good news is that US policymakers\u2019 efforts on pesticides in food have produced the opposite situation. According to our research, Europe loses $194bn in economic productivity due to organophosphate pesticide exposure, whereas the US loses closer to $45bn.</p> <h2>Solutions</h2> <p>You\u2019ll be delighted to know that the changes that are needed don\u2019t necessarily require regulation. Just look at the impact recently of a small study that found perfluoroalkyl compounds in the linings of food packaging in two major supermarket chains. These major purchasers got rid of the offending packages, and insisted that their producer change their ways, and document the absence of these thyroid-disrupting compounds. Organic food is showing near double-digit annual percentage gains, and is now starting to appear in big-box stores. Now we see companies proudly displaying products documented to be free of bisphenol A and phthalates.</p> <p>Clayton M Christensen coined the phrase <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation\">disruptive innovation</a> </em>back in 1995 to describe innovation that fundamentally changes the value system, creating a new set of winners and losers. Consumers win when disruptive innovations for all sorts of products reset the competitive landscape for product characteristics, price and other factors. When these disruptions happen, the market becomes more efficient, providing greater value to the consumer. These changes don\u2019t always work for chemicals, especially when they are replaced with structurally similar analogues. But green chemistry is now bringing us to a point where newer alternatives are able to be tested and replace those with health concerns.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a global competitiveness issue to keep in mind for those companies that don\u2019t evolve. If companies in the US don\u2019t do the right thing, companies in other countries might recognize the threat ahead first. The countries that lead the way in making the changes will eventually win by being more competitive in the eyes of the public that increasingly values avoiding EDC exposures.</p> <p>The change we need to address endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs is broad in scale \u2013 ideally, policy change would address it all. But if we start to rise up, speak out and act in our homes and our workplaces, with our family, friends and colleagues, we can start to produce the change that is needed, whoever is in the White House or in Congress.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/leonardo-trasande\">Leonardo Trasande</a> is an expert in children\u2019s environmental health and a professor and vice-chair for research at Department of P</em><em>ediatrics at New York University.

Look at phasing out lead in gasoline. To this day, the US receives a $200bn annual economic stimulus package each year because lead levels in children plummeted when the US Environmental Protection Agency moved to protect children. Now, we realize that a larger suite of chemicals can disrupt hormones and cost our economy.

Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) are recognized as a major public health threat by the Endocrine Society, the World Health Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians and the American Academy of Pediatrics. But what\u2019s not recognized is that these chemicals cost the US $340bn each year, according to research I was part of, published in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology journal. Yes, that\u2019s 2.3% of the US gross domestic product. The key drivers of these costs in the US are the effects of flame retardants and pesticides on the developing brains of children.

In the US, the average American has levels that would be in the 95th percentile of Europeans or anyone else in the world for that matter. That\u2019s why brominated flame retardants cost the US over $266bn each year, while in Europe those same chemicals cost only $13bn. The frightening part of that story is how literally chemical exposures can undermine our competitive advantage with other countries, undermining our educational talent. And, these economic estimates don\u2019t include the costs of having fewer children with genius IQs. The researchers only measured the costs of children who were pushed into the intellectually disabled range. The good news is that US policymakers\u2019 efforts on pesticides in food have produced the opposite situation. According to our research, Europe loses $194bn in economic productivity due to organophosphate pesticide exposure, whereas the US loses closer to $45bn. Solutions You\u2019ll be delighted to know that the changes that are needed don\u2019t necessarily require regulation. Just look at the impact recently of a small study that found perfluoroalkyl compounds in the linings of food packaging in two major supermarket chains. These major purchasers got rid of the offending packages, and insisted that their producer change their ways, and document the absence of these thyroid-disrupting compounds. Organic food is showing near double-digit annual percentage gains, and is now starting to appear in big-box stores. Now we see companies proudly displaying products documented to be free of bisphenol A and phthalates. Clayton M Christensen coined the phrase disruptive innovation back in 1995 to describe innovation that fundamentally changes the value system, creating a new set of winners and losers. Consumers win when disruptive innovations for all sorts of products reset the competitive landscape for product characteristics, price and other factors. When these disruptions happen, the market becomes more efficient, providing greater value to the consumer. These changes don\u2019t always work for chemicals, especially when they are replaced with structurally similar analogues. But green chemistry is now bringing us to a point where newer alternatives are able to be tested and replace those with health concerns. And there\u2019s a global competitiveness issue to keep in mind for those companies that don\u2019t evolve. If companies in the US don\u2019t do the right thing, companies in other countries might recognize the threat ahead first. The countries that lead the way in making the changes will eventually win by being more competitive in the eyes of the public that increasingly values avoiding EDC exposures. The change we need to address endocrine disrupting chemicals EDCs is broad in scale \u2013 ideally, policy change would address it all. But if we start to rise up, speak out and act in our homes and our workplaces, with our family, friends and colleagues, we can start to produce the change that is needed, whoever is in the White House or in Congress.

      "body": "<p>For almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism\u2019s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society \u2013 or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy.</p> <p>Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers \u2013 these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable; to depict any alternative as impossible.</p> <p>In this increasingly hostile environment, the left\u2019s economic approach has been reactive \u2013 resisting these huge changes, often in vain \u2013 and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left\u2019s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in \u2013 let alone reshaped or replaced \u2013 as wanting to take the world \u201cback to the 70s\u201d. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy \u2013 no more practical than time travel.</p> <p>And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year\u2019s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that \u201ca gap has opened up\u201d in the west \u201cbetween the theory of how a market economy delivers \u2026 and the reality\u201d. He went on: \u201cToo many people feel that \u2026 the system is not working for them.\u201d</p> <p>There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. \u201cWe\u2019re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,\u201d says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. \u201cThe voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions \u2013 the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \u2013 are recognising its downsides.\u201d Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works.</p> <p>A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one.</p> <p>Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network\u2019s central figures. \u201cWe\u2019re stripping economics back to basics,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want economics to ask: \u2018Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?\u2019 Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.\u201d</p> <p>The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone \u2013 just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company; or local politicians reshaping their city\u2019s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations; or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm.</p> <p>This \u201cdemocratic economy\u201d is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. \u201cIf we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to \u2026 allow communities to shape their local economies,\u201d write Joe Guinan and Martin O\u2019Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/38315422/Joe_Guinan_and_Martin_ONeill_2019_-_From_Community_Wealth_Building_to_System_Change_Local_Roots_for_Economic_Transformation_--_forthcoming_in_IPPR_Progressive_Review_Spring_2019_pre-publication_version_\" title=\"\">a recent article</a> for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) \u2013 a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. \u201cIt is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.\u201d Moreover, Guinan and O\u2019Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives.</p> <p>The new economists\u2019 enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state; between workers and employers; between the local and global economy; and between those with economic assets and those without. \u201cEconomic power and control must rest more equally,\u201d declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement\u2019s members and ideas.</p> <p>In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation \u2013 usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power \u2013 and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want \u2013 at the least \u2013 to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers \u2013 a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion.</p> <p>The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than \u2013 as we have at present \u2013 a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn\u2019t really economics at all. It\u2019s \u201ca new view of the world\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81acb61c2d73bc6e1ab1afc66826f8d95e644270\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81acb61c2d73bc6e1ab1afc66826f8d95e644270/0_0_1812_1444/1000.png\" alt=\"Nathalie Lees illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"797\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it.</p> <p>Over the past year, the left\u2019s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. \u201cBut nowadays,\u201d he told me, \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as \u201can ecosystem\u201d. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born.</p> <p>\u201cThere are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks \u2013 or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly incestuous, but it\u2019s rather thrilling.\u201d</p> <p>This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how \u201cto build support for a new economy\u201d \u2013 for example, by telling effective \u201cstories\u201d about it in the mainstream media. <a href=\"https://www.stirtoaction.com/\" title=\"\">Stir to Action</a>, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly \u201cmagazine for the new economy\u201d, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves?</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,\u201d says the magazine\u2019s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. \u201cThe movement has gone from oppose to propose.\u201d</p> <p>Looming over this activity is the possibility, for the first time in decades, of a Labour government receptive to new leftwing economic ideas. \u201c[The shadow chancellor] John McDonnell seems to get it,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh, guardedly. \u201cHe has some shared history with some of our movements. He has made interesting comments \u2026 about introducing co-operative ownership of the railways, for example.\u201d</p> <p>Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a <a href=\"http://renewal.org.uk/articles/the-institutional-turn-labours-new-political-economy\" title=\"\">widely</a><a href=\"http://renewal.org.uk/articles/the-institutional-turn-labours-new-political-economy\" title=\"\"> circulated article</a> by Guinan and O\u2019Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a \u201ctransformation of the British economy \u2026 a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain\u201d, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: \u201cJohn McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven\u2019t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.\u201d</p> <p>James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell\u2019s key advisers, is now writing a book about \u201can economy for the many\u201d. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists\u2019 arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party\u2019s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour\u2019s appetite for them. \u201cThey\u2019re virtually asking, \u2018Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?\u2019\u201d says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. \u201cWe scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!\u201d says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report\u2019s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>And yet, outside McDonnell\u2019s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed \u2013 or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it \u2013 the new economists differ as to which is the goal \u2013 is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy \u2013 aka \u201cthe 70s\u201d \u2013 or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union.</p> <p>However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still \u201cMarxist\u201d. \u201cThe new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can\u2019t be heard,\u201d says Guinan.</p> <p>But with neoliberalism ailing, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/a-zombie-party-the-deepening-crisis-of-conservatism\" title=\"\">the right bereft</a> of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left\u2019s new economics may have a long future \u2013 whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders \u2013 or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, \u201cmen should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control\u201d.</p> <p>This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. \u201cThe real aim,\u201d wrote Cole in 1920, should be \u201cwresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise\u201d, in order to ultimately \u201cmake possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole\u201d.</p> <p>Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation; but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long.</p> <p>When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years.</p> <p>It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of individualism during the decade. \u201cMore people want to do more for themselves,\u201d he wrote in 1970. \u201cTechnology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation \u2026 It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"61162d8e4d3a6fce00ca14c298f87998e2c5ef0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61162d8e4d3a6fce00ca14c298f87998e2c5ef0a/0_185_4197_2518/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tony Benn at the Labour party conference in Brighton, October 1979\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Benn at the Labour party conference in 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper; Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators; and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced \u2013 a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors \u2013 were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn\u2019s department. An <a href=\"https://newint.org/features/1981/12/01/giants\" title=\"\">even-handed 1981 report</a> on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start \u2013 they were \u201ccrippled giants\u201d.</p> <p>The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirkby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there \u201ctransformed by their experiences\u201d of helping run the business. They became \u201creal worker-managers\u201d. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby\u2019s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983.</p> <p>Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga \u201cundermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh.</p> <p>From Benn\u2019s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called \u201cworkers\u2019 control\u201d were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade\u2019s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began \u2013 across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn\u2019s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers.</p> <p>Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well.</p> <p>\u201cTroubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,\u201d says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. \u201cBut American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.\u201d</p> <p>In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America\u2019s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called \u201ccommunity wealth-building\u201d. It aims to end struggling local economies\u2019 reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations \u2013 such as chain retailers \u2013 and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead.</p> <p>In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative\u2019s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: \u201cStop the leakage of money out of our community.\u201d Yet \u201ccommunity wealth building\u201d also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism\u2019s narrow criteria.</p> <p>Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: \u201cWe bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he\u2019s done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc14fe06f4cf883f72c3ad45829d6acce5e66b5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc14fe06f4cf883f72c3ad45829d6acce5e66b5c/0_29_3360_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The renovated market in Preston, Lancashire, 2018\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The renovated market in Preston, Lancashire, 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986.</p> <p>Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax \u2013 especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity; and too strong \u2013 too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell\u2019s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, \u201chave to get into changing how capitalism works\u201d.</p> <p>In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn\u2019s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of \u201cthe Cleveland model\u201d, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/06/brutal-cuts-fight-back-preston-dragons-den\" title=\"\">Preston in Lancashire</a>. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government.</p> <p>Preston\u2019s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists\u2019 studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city\u2019s large concentration of other public sector bodies \u2013 a hospital, a university, a police headquarters \u2013 have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls \u201canchor institutions\u201d. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013.</p> <p>The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in Preston is common sense, but it\u2019s also ideological,\u201d Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. \u201cWe\u2019re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we\u2019ve got to create alternatives.\u201d By doing so \u2013 especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts \u2013 Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible.</p> <p>The council, Brown continued proudly, was \u201csupporting local small businesses rather than big capitalists\u201d. It was using its \u201cleverage\u201d as a procurer to make businesses behave more ethically: pay the living wage, recruit more diverse staff. And it was aiming to make the city a place where cooperatives were mainstream rather than niche: \u201cMy intention is to get them to 30%, 40% of our economy.\u201d</p> <p>I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy \u2013 and by implication, economies beyond. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m quite strong-minded.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left\u2019s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci \u2013 a big influence on them and McDonnell \u2013 called a \u201cwar of position\u201d: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a \u201ctransition\u201d that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted \u201ca staged transformation of our economic system\u201d. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston \u2013 and quite a few are interested \u2013 then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours.</p> <p>A few hours after meeting Brown in Preston, I spoke to McDonnell again about the left\u2019s new intellectual vibrancy. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to reconstruct what we had with Tony Benn in the 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cA range of thinking groups \u2013 NEF and Class [another leftwing economic thinktank] have been revitalised. Michael Jacobs is buzzing with ideas. We\u2019re arguing effectively for a more democratic economy. Doubling the number of cooperatives in the UK\u201d \u2013 as NEF advocated last year \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s relatively timid. We want to go further.\u201d</p> <p>He offered no more details. But the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/24/how-would-labour-plan-to-give-workers-10-stake-in-big-firms-work\" title=\"\">inclusive ownership fund</a>\u201d policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company\u2019s ownership structure a group of shareholders \u2013 its employees \u2013 who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. \u201cThe funds are meant to tip the balance,\u201d says Lawrence, \u201ctowards a different kind of corporate culture.\u201d Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left\u2019s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: \u201cRadical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.\u201d</p> <p>But turning the new economics into national policies will be hard, even if Labour wins power. Last summer, the head of NEF, Miatta Fahnbulleh, was invited to an awayday for Treasury civil servants to talk about the new economy. \u201cWhen I got there,\u201d she told me, \u201cI quickly realised that to the Treasury the new economy just means tech [companies]. When I started talking instead about how the economy could operate differently, they bought my premise that the status quo has problems \u2013 they\u2019re the Treasury, they\u2019ve got the data. They thought that the new economics was interesting \u2026 But only in a debating society sort of way.\u201d</p> <p>Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: \u201cWhitehall hates big change \u2013 every time.\u201d Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. \u201cSome of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it\u2019s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.\u201d</p> <p>He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. \u201cMy advice is, \u2018If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You\u2019ll get people joining who want to do new things.\u201d But Benn\u2019s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall\u2019s conservatives may not be that simple.</p> <p>And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company\u2019s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. \u201cThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really <em>hates</em> inclusive ownership,\u201d says one McDonnell ally. \u201cYou can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.\u201d</p> <p>When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: \u201cLabour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.\u201d</p> <p>The new economists say they are not intimidated. \u201cWe in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,\u201d says Guinan. \u201cA democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: \u2018Off you go to Singapore!\u2019 The left shouldn\u2019t be afraid of a little creative destruction\u201d, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: \u201cExploitative companies can go to the wall.\u201d</p> <p>That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway \u2013 thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. \u201cBrexit alone will require a very interventionist state\u201d to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. \u201cIt will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, \u2018You simply can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of \u201clocal businesses\u201d and \u201clocal jobs\u201d, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city \u2013 by making it more socially sensitive \u2013 rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be pragmatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still in a free-market environment. And I don\u2019t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There\u2019s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.\u201d Not everyone on the left would see small businesses \u2013 often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies \u2013 in such benign terms. But Brown went on: \u201cThe Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-business/anti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.\u201d</p> <p>Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. \u201cWho incorporates who ...\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate!\u201d Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would \u201cwelcome\u201d business \u201cinto our warm embrace\u201d.</p> <p>The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy\u2019s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, \u201cWe avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.\u201d Then he added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.\u201d</p> <p>McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain\u2019s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. \u201cEn route to a socialist society,\u201d she says, \u201cthere might be moments when a different capitalism emerges\u201d \u2013 ie, a more benign one.</p> <p>Yet the problem for the left with settling for \u201ca different capitalism\u201d, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s crisis of capitalism \u2013 during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides.</p> <p>Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters \u2013 brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter \u2013 that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. \u201cThe effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that\u2019s talked about nearly enough on the left,\u201d admits Berry. \u201cAs for de-growth\u201d \u2013 the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective \u2013 \u201cthe Labour party won\u2019t touch it with a bargepole.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s ally agreed. \u201cDe-growth,\u201d he said, \u201cis just appalling labelling.\u201d Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: \u201ca politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d660bbf82c4ca4085e118198e85a415d8d83d1cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d660bbf82c4ca4085e118198e85a415d8d83d1cf/0_5_2936_1761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Green New Deal event in Washington DC, May 2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at a Green New Deal event in Washington DC, May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cliff Owen/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism\u2019s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain\u2019s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government\u2019s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/27/labour-green-industrial-revolution\" title=\"\">Guardian article</a> advocating a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, including \u201cdeep-water turbines in the North Sea\u201d, which \u201ccould provide four times Europe\u2019s entire electricity demand\u201d and \u201ccould be built and delivered from the UK\u201d. It was quite a thrilling vision; but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned.</p> <p>Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today\u2019s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people\u2019s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding \u2013 barely part of their identity at all.</p> <p>Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. \u201cContemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism \u2013 to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth\u2019s mission had been shown on a big screen \u2013 which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called <a href=\"https://labourlist.org/2018/09/watch-together-well-rebuild-britain-labours-party-political-broadcast/\" title=\"\">Our Town</a> \u2013 Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders \u2013 just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board.</p> <p>Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts \u2013 the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers\u2019 best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how.</p> <p>\u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, or sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "For almost half a century, something vital has been missing from leftwing politics in western countries. Since the 70s, the left has changed how many people think about prejudice, personal identity and freedom. It has exposed capitalism\u2019s cruelties. It has sometimes won elections, and sometimes governed effectively afterwards. But it has not been able to change fundamentally how wealth and work function in society \u2013 or even provide a compelling vision of how that might be done. The left, in short, has not had an economic policy. Instead, the right has had one. Privatisation, deregulation, lower taxes for business and the rich, more power for employers and shareholders, less power for workers \u2013 these interlocking policies have intensified capitalism, and made it ever more ubiquitous. There have been immense efforts to make capitalism appear inevitable; to depict any alternative as impossible. In this increasingly hostile environment, the left\u2019s economic approach has been reactive \u2013 resisting these huge changes, often in vain \u2013 and often backward-looking, even nostalgic. For many decades, the same two critical analysts of capitalism, Karl Marx and John Maynard Keynes, have continued to dominate the left\u2019s economic imagination. Marx died in 1883, Keynes in 1946. The last time their ideas had a significant influence on western governments or voters was 40 years ago, during the turbulent final days of postwar social democracy. Ever since, rightwingers and centrists have caricatured anyone arguing that capitalism should be reined in \u2013 let alone reshaped or replaced \u2013 as wanting to take the world \u201cback to the 70s\u201d. Altering our economic system has been presented as a fantasy \u2013 no more practical than time travel. And yet, in recent years, that system has started to fail. Rather than sustainable and widely shared prosperity, it has produced wage stagnation, ever more workers in poverty, ever more inequality, banking crises, the convulsions of populism and the impending climate catastrophe. Even senior rightwing politicians sometimes concede the seriousness of the crisis. At last year\u2019s Conservative conference, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, admitted that \u201ca gap has opened up\u201d in the west \u201cbetween the theory of how a market economy delivers \u2026 and the reality\u201d. He went on: \u201cToo many people feel that \u2026 the system is not working for them.\u201d There is a dawning recognition that a new kind of economy is needed: fairer, more inclusive, less exploitative, less destructive of society and the planet. \u201cWe\u2019re in a time when people are much more open to radical economic ideas,\u201d says Michael Jacobs, a former prime ministerial adviser to Gordon Brown. \u201cThe voters have revolted against neoliberalism. The international economic institutions \u2013 the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund \u2013 are recognising its downsides.\u201d Meanwhile, the 2008 financial crisis and the previously unthinkable government interventions that halted it have discredited two central neoliberal orthodoxies: that capitalism cannot fail, and that governments cannot step in to change how the economy works. A huge political space has opened up. In Britain and the US, in many ways the most capitalist western countries, and the ones where its problems are starkest, an emerging network of thinkers, activists and politicians has begun to seize this opportunity. They are trying to construct a new kind of leftwing economics: one that addresses the flaws of the 21st-century economy, but which also explains, in practical ways, how future leftwing governments could create a better one. Christine Berry, a young British freelance academic, is one of the network\u2019s central figures. \u201cWe\u2019re stripping economics back to basics,\u201d she says. \u201cWe want economics to ask: \u2018Who owns these resources? Who has power in this company?\u2019 Conventional economic discourse obfuscates these questions, to the benefit of those with power.\u201d The new leftwing economics wants to see the redistribution of economic power, so that it is held by everyone \u2013 just as political power is held by everyone in a healthy democracy. This redistribution of power could involve employees taking ownership of part of every company; or local politicians reshaping their city\u2019s economy to favour local, ethical businesses over large corporations; or national politicians making co-operatives a capitalist norm. This \u201cdemocratic economy\u201d is not some idealistic fantasy: bits of it are already being constructed in Britain and the US. And without this transformation, the new economists argue, the increasing inequality of economic power will soon make democracy itself unworkable. \u201cIf we want to live in democratic societies, then we need to \u2026 allow communities to shape their local economies,\u201d write Joe Guinan and Martin O\u2019Neill, both prolific advocates of the new economics, in a recent article for the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) \u2013 a thinktank previously associated with New Labour. \u201cIt is no longer good enough to see the economy as some kind of separate technocratic domain in which the central values of a democratic society somehow do not apply.\u201d Moreover, Guinan and O\u2019Neill argue, making the economy more democratic will actually help to revitalise democracy: voters are less likely to feel angry, or apathetic, if they are included in economic decisions that fundamentally affect their lives. The new economists\u2019 enormously ambitious project means transforming the relationship between capitalism and the state; between workers and employers; between the local and global economy; and between those with economic assets and those without. \u201cEconomic power and control must rest more equally,\u201d declared a report last year by the New Economics Foundation (NEF), a radical London thinktank that has acted as an incubator for many of the new movement\u2019s members and ideas. In the past, left-of-centre British governments have attempted to reshape the economy by taxation \u2013 usually focused on income rather than other forms of economic power \u2013 and by nationalisation, which usually meant replacing a private-sector management elite with a state-appointed one. Instead of such limited, patchily successful interventions, the new economists want to see much more systemic and permanent change. They want \u2013 at the least \u2013 to change how capitalism works. But, crucially, they want this change to be only partially initiated and overseen by the state, not controlled by it. They envisage a transformation that happens almost organically, driven by employees and consumers \u2013 a sort of non-violent revolution in slow motion. The result, the new economists claim, will be an economy that suits society, rather than \u2013 as we have at present \u2013 a society subordinated to the economy. The new economics, suggests Berry, isn\u2019t really economics at all. It\u2019s \u201ca new view of the world\u201d. * * * In the excitable but often intellectually becalmed world of British politics, the arrival of a significant new set of ideas tends to generate certain responses. Events about it are packed out. Ambitious young researchers gravitate towards it. Adventurous older thinkers are intrigued by it. New intellectual institutions are created around it. Mainstream journalists initially dismiss it. Over the past year, the left\u2019s new economics has acquired this status. Jacobs, who is nearing 60, spent the New Labour era trying, and largely failing, to persuade centrist politicians that the economy needed drastically reshaping. \u201cBut nowadays,\u201d he told me, \u201cI\u2019m thinking: \u2018Oh God, we finally might be able to do it.\u2019\u201d Like all the new economists I met, he talks very fast, cutting short sentences as if there is too much to explain in the time available. A longstanding environmentalist, he describes the emerging network of new economists as \u201can ecosystem\u201d. Like the one that produced Thatcherism in the 70s, this network may involve only a few dozen people, whose polemics and talks and policy papers are being followed by an audience in the hundreds, but there is an intoxicating sense of political and economic taboos being broken, and of a potential new consensus being born. \u201cThere are British and American websites that publish a lot of our stuff, like openDemocracy, Jacobin and Novara. There are people producing stuff while freelancing for thinktanks \u2013 or setting up new thinktanks. And social media means the ideas spread, and collaborations happen, much faster than when leftwing economics was just about meetings and pamphlets,\u201d Jacobs says. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly incestuous, but it\u2019s rather thrilling.\u201d This ferment is beginning to solidify into a movement. The New Economy Organisers Network (Neon), a NEF spin-off based in London, runs workshops for leftwing activists, to learn how \u201cto build support for a new economy\u201d \u2013 for example, by telling effective \u201cstories\u201d about it in the mainstream media. Stir to Action, an activist organisation based in Bridport in Dorset, publishes a quarterly \u201cmagazine for the new economy\u201d, and organises advice sessions in left-leaning cities such as Bristol and Oxford: Worker Co-ops: How to Get Started, Community Ownership: What If We Ran It Ourselves? \u201cThere\u2019s a totally new impulse to activism about the economy now,\u201d says the magazine\u2019s editor, Jonny Gordon-Farleigh, who was previously involved in anticapitalist and environmental protests. \u201cThe movement has gone from oppose to propose.\u201d Looming over this activity is the possibility, for the first time in decades, of a Labour government receptive to new leftwing economic ideas. \u201c[The shadow chancellor] John McDonnell seems to get it,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh, guardedly. \u201cHe has some shared history with some of our movements. He has made interesting comments \u2026 about introducing co-operative ownership of the railways, for example.\u201d Others in the movement are more bullish. Last autumn, a widely circulated article by Guinan and O\u2019Neill in the leftwing journal Renewal claimed that McDonnell could be planning nothing less than a \u201ctransformation of the British economy \u2026 a radical programme for dismantling and displacing corporate and financial power in Britain\u201d, in favour of the less privileged. Guinan told me: \u201cJohn McDonnell is extremely intellectually curious. I haven\u2019t seen another political figure at that level of seniority whose doors are so open to new thinking.\u201d James Meadway, until recently one of McDonnell\u2019s key advisers, is now writing a book about \u201can economy for the many\u201d. Between 2010 and 2015, Meadway worked at NEF, where his reports and articles sketched out many of the new economists\u2019 arguments. Several NEF staffers told me that since McDonnell became shadow chancellor, the usual relationship between leftwing thinktanks and Labour had been reversed: instead of desperately trying to draw the party\u2019s attention to their proposals, they were struggling to keep up with Labour\u2019s appetite for them. \u201cThey\u2019re virtually asking, \u2018Have you got anything else at the back of your cupboard?\u2019\u201d says one delighted but slightly perplexed NEF veteran. \u201cWe scrabble around, and give them anything we can come up with, as quickly as we can.\u201d Last July, NEF published a report advocating a sharp increase in the number of British co-operatives. On one of its later pages, with almost no fanfare, the report also proposed that conventional companies be required to give their employees shares, to create what NEF called an \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d. In September, with a few modifications, the proposal became Labour party policy. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, from thinktank idea to adoption as policy!\u201d says Mathew Lawrence, one of the report\u2019s authors. This month, a version of the policy was also adopted by the US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. And yet, outside McDonnell\u2019s circle and the transatlantic radical left, the new economics has gone largely unnoticed \u2013 or been casually derided. The black holes of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are partly responsible, sucking attention away from everything else. But so is the radical nature of the new economics itself. Transforming or ending capitalism as we know it \u2013 the new economists differ as to which is the goal \u2013 is a difficult idea for most British politicians and journalists to take on board. After half a century accepting the economic status quo, they associate any leftwing alternatives to it either with out-of-date postwar social democracy \u2013 aka \u201cthe 70s\u201d \u2013 or with leftwing authoritarianism, with present-day Venezuela or the Soviet Union. However often McDonnell says in interviews that he wants to see a democratic economy, the adjective most frequently applied to him is still \u201cMarxist\u201d. \u201cThe new economic thinking is almost like a frequency that can\u2019t be heard,\u201d says Guinan. But with neoliberalism ailing, and the right bereft of other economic ideas, as the Conservative leadership contest is currently demonstrating, the left\u2019s new economics may have a long future \u2013 whether or not McDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party wins power. To borrow a line from Thatcher, there is now an alternative. * * * The dream of a democratic economy has flickered on the margins of leftwing politics for at least a century. During the early 1920s, the British socialist theorists GDH Cole and RH Tawney both wrote fresh, provocative books arguing that workers should manage themselves, rather than submit to employers or shareholders \u2013 or to the state, as more orthodox Labour thinkers envisaged. In economic life, as in politics, Tawney argued in 1921, \u201cmen should not be ruled by an authority which they cannot control\u201d. This empowerment of the workers was intended to be the first step in a larger transformation. \u201cThe real aim,\u201d wrote Cole in 1920, should be \u201cwresting bit by bit from the hands of the possessing classes the economic power which they now exercise\u201d, in order to ultimately \u201cmake possible an equitable distribution of the national income and a reasonable reorganisation of Society as a whole\u201d. Yet Cole was vague about how this overturning of the traditional order would happen. He ruled out a revolution, and a general strike, on the grounds that workers did not have the necessary access to weapons, or the economic resources to beat their employers in a protracted industrial struggle. A bold Labour government could, in theory, pass the necessary legislation; but the Labour administrations of the 1920s and 30s were cautious, and did not last long. When Labour did acquire the confidence and time to reconfigure the economy, during the premierships of Clement Attlee in the 40s and Harold Wilson in the 60s, the party chose to do so through Whitehall plans and bureaucracies, such as Wilson\u2019s Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), rather than by democratising the economy. The results were mixed: the DEA lasted only five years. It was not until the 70s that a powerful Labour politician became interested in democratising the economy. Unusually for a Westminster grandee, Tony Benn paid close attention to the decline of deference and growth of individualism during the decade. \u201cMore people want to do more for themselves,\u201d he wrote in 1970. \u201cTechnology releases forces that permit and encourage decentralisation \u2026 It must be a prime objective of socialists to work for the redistribution of power.\u201d In 1974, Wilson made Benn secretary of state for industry. The economy was struggling. Benn oversaw and subsidised worker-run cooperatives at three ailing large businesses: the Scottish Daily News, a Glasgow newspaper; Kirkby Manufacturing and Engineering, a Liverpool maker of radiators; and Meriden, a producer of motorcycles in the West Midlands. The challenges these co-operatives faced \u2013 a lack of previous investment, and strong foreign or domestic competitors \u2013 were made worse by unsympathetic, economically conservative civil servants in Benn\u2019s department. An even-handed 1981 report on the cooperatives by the leftwing magazine New Internationalist described them as doomed from the start \u2013 they were \u201ccrippled giants\u201d. The Scottish Daily News cooperative lasted five months. The Kirkby cooperative did better. Eric Heffer, a minister working for Benn, found trade union shop stewards there \u201ctransformed by their experiences\u201d of helping run the business. They became \u201creal worker-managers\u201d. The cooperative made it through the mid-70s recession. But soon after the 1979 election, Margaret Thatcher\u2019s incoming government terminated the experiment by cancelling Kirkby\u2019s subsidies. Meriden survived the change of government, and another recession in the early 80s. But it went bankrupt in 1983. Benn himself lasted only a year in the industry department, before he was removed by Wilson, who had never completely accepted his radicalism. Benn never held such a pivotal economic post again. Just as significantly, the saga \u201cundermined the co-operative option in Labour party policymaking circles for decades to come,\u201d says Gordon-Farleigh. From Benn\u2019s demotion in 1975 until Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as leader 40 years later, the Labour hierarchy broadly accepted that the economy should be based on profit, competition, and top-down management. The attempts by Benn and others on the British left during the 70s to establish what they sometimes provocatively called \u201cworkers\u2019 control\u201d were largely forgotten, or remembered as just another of a derided decade\u2019s failed utopias. The chance for a democratic economy seemed to have gone. * * * Yet during the lean years that followed for the British left, another experiment in democratising the economy began \u2013 across the Atlantic, in a country less associated with revolts against capitalism. It was more local, but also more thorough than Benn\u2019s backing of a scattering of vulnerable co-operatives, and it sought to mobilise the power of consumers rather than producers. Gar Alperovitz is an 83-year-old American economist and activist. Since the 60s, he has doggedly promoted economic innovations that put social before commercial goals. Often, he has been a fringe figure, but intermittently he has attracted wide attention. In 1983, he featured heavily in a Time magazine cover story about the future of the economy. In 2000, at the University of Maryland, he co-founded the Democracy Collaborative, a centre for research about how to revive the political and economic life of declining parts of the US, which gradually expanded into an activist body as well. \u201cTroubled American cities are in a more advanced state of decay than their British equivalents,\u201d says Guinan, who has worked for the Democracy Collaborative for a decade. \u201cBut American local government also has greater powers. So you have the ability to create radical new models from the ground up.\u201d In 2008, the Democracy Collaborative began working in Cleveland, one of America\u2019s poorest big cities, which had been losing jobs and residents for decades. The activists followed an Alperovitz strategy called \u201ccommunity wealth-building\u201d. It aims to end struggling local economies\u2019 reliance on unequal relationships with distant, wealth-extracting corporations \u2013 such as chain retailers \u2013 and to base these economies around local, more socially conscious businesses instead. In Cleveland, the Democracy Collaborative helped set up a solar power company, an industrial laundry, and a city-centre hydroponic farm growing lettuces and basil. All three enterprises were owned by their employees, and some of their profits went to a holding company tasked with establishing more cooperatives in the city. All three enterprises have succeeded, so far. The goal of the project was summed up in blunt, almost populist terms by one of the Democracy Collaborative\u2019s co-founders, Ted Howard, in 2017: \u201cStop the leakage of money out of our community.\u201d Yet \u201ccommunity wealth building\u201d also has a more subtle purpose: it is a concrete demonstration that economic decisions can be based on more than neoliberalism\u2019s narrow criteria. Howard was speaking at a new economics conference in England, which had been organised by McDonnell. The two men are on first-name terms. Last year, McDonnell introduced Howard at another Labour event, in Preston: \u201cWe bring him across on a regular basis now, to explain the work that he\u2019s done.\u201d McDonnell has long been interested in decentralising and democratising the economy. He frequently cites Tawney, Cole and Benn in speeches. During the 80s, McDonnell was deputy leader and effectively the chancellor of the Greater London Council (GLC), which pursued Benn-style experiments with state-backed co-operatives, with similarly mixed results, until it was abolished by Thatcher in 1986. Contrary to his usual portrayal as a statist ogre, McDonnell believes there are limits to how far the left can increase taxes and government spending. In his view, many voters are unwilling, or simply unable, to pay much more tax \u2013 especially when living standards are squeezed, as now. He also believes that central government has lost authority: it is seen as simultaneously too weak, short of money thanks to austerity; and too strong \u2013 too intrusive and domineering towards citizens. Instead of relying on the state to create a better society, one of McDonnell\u2019s close allies argues, leftwing governments, at both the municipal and national level, \u201chave to get into changing how capitalism works\u201d. In recent years, with McDonnell and Corbyn\u2019s encouragement, and guidance from the Democracy Collaborative, many of the principles of \u201cthe Cleveland model\u201d, as it is reverently known in transatlantic leftwing circles, have been adopted by the Labour-run council in the small, ex-industrial city of Preston in Lancashire. The regeneration has been promoted as a foretaste of Britain under a Corbyn government. Preston\u2019s hilltop city centre, which had been fading for decades, now has a refurbished and busy covered market, new artists\u2019 studios in former council offices, and coffee and craft beer being sold from converted shipping containers right behind the town hall. All these enterprises have been facilitated by the council. Less visibly, but probably more importantly, the city\u2019s large concentration of other public sector bodies \u2013 a hospital, a university, a police headquarters \u2013 have been persuaded by the council to procure goods and services locally whenever possible, becoming what the Democracy Collaborative calls \u201canchor institutions\u201d. They now spend almost four times as much of their budgets in Preston as they did in 2013. The council leader is Matthew Brown, an intense, angular 46-year-old who was partly inspired to enter politics by seeing Benn on television as a teenager. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in Preston is common sense, but it\u2019s also ideological,\u201d Brown told me, when we met in his sparse office. \u201cWe\u2019re living through a systemic crisis of capitalism, and we\u2019ve got to create alternatives.\u201d By doing so \u2013 especially at a time when local councils are supposed to have been hugely weakened by government cuts \u2013 Preston is in small but visible ways undermining the authority of neoliberalism, dependent as it is on the insistence that no other economic options are possible. The council, Brown continued proudly, was \u201csupporting local small businesses rather than big capitalists\u201d. It was using its \u201cleverage\u201d as a procurer to make businesses behave more ethically: pay the living wage, recruit more diverse staff. And it was aiming to make the city a place where cooperatives were mainstream rather than niche: \u201cMy intention is to get them to 30%, 40% of our economy.\u201d I asked whether he had any doubts about a city with a population of less than 150,000 acting as a model for reshaping the whole British economy \u2013 and by implication, economies beyond. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m quite strong-minded.\u201d * * * There is a confidence about the new economists, which comes as a surprise after all the left\u2019s defeats during the 80s and 90s. But with capitalism less effective and popular than it was then, the new economists believe they are now engaged in what the political theorist Antonio Gramsci \u2013 a big influence on them and McDonnell \u2013 called a \u201cwar of position\u201d: a steady accumulation of alliances, ideas and public credibility. Berry describes this process as a \u201ctransition\u201d that can lead to a different economy. McDonnell told me in 2017 that he wanted \u201ca staged transformation of our economic system\u201d. If enough other Labour councils copy Preston \u2013 and quite a few are interested \u2013 then even without a Corbyn government, let alone any kind of socialist revolution, the British economy will have moved leftwards, both in the priorities it chooses and the interests it favours. A few hours after meeting Brown in Preston, I spoke to McDonnell again about the left\u2019s new intellectual vibrancy. \u201cWe\u2019re beginning to reconstruct what we had with Tony Benn in the 70s,\u201d he said. \u201cA range of thinking groups \u2013 NEF and Class [another leftwing economic thinktank] have been revitalised. Michael Jacobs is buzzing with ideas. We\u2019re arguing effectively for a more democratic economy. Doubling the number of cooperatives in the UK\u201d \u2013 as NEF advocated last year \u2013 \u201cthat\u2019s relatively timid. We want to go further.\u201d He offered no more details. But the \u201cinclusive ownership fund\u201d policy adopted by Labour shows the potential of the new economic ideas. The funds are intended to be Trojan horses: inserting into a company\u2019s ownership structure a group of shareholders \u2013 its employees \u2013 who are more likely to favour higher wages and long-term investment. \u201cThe funds are meant to tip the balance,\u201d says Lawrence, \u201ctowards a different kind of corporate culture.\u201d Or as the writer and activist Hilary Wainwright, one of the Labour left\u2019s shrewdest thinkers since the 70s, puts it: \u201cRadical change, when it destabilises the status quo in the right way, creates further opportunities for change.\u201d But turning the new economics into national policies will be hard, even if Labour wins power. Last summer, the head of NEF, Miatta Fahnbulleh, was invited to an awayday for Treasury civil servants to talk about the new economy. \u201cWhen I got there,\u201d she told me, \u201cI quickly realised that to the Treasury the new economy just means tech [companies]. When I started talking instead about how the economy could operate differently, they bought my premise that the status quo has problems \u2013 they\u2019re the Treasury, they\u2019ve got the data. They thought that the new economics was interesting \u2026 But only in a debating society sort of way.\u201d Before NEF, Fahnbulleh worked for the cabinet office and the 10 Downing Street strategy unit. She predicts there will be Whitehall resistance to the new economics: \u201cWhitehall hates big change \u2013 every time.\u201d Jacobs, who has longer experience of government, is slightly more optimistic. \u201cSome of the younger Treasury people will probably be quite excited by a new economic approach. Some of the older ones will think it\u2019s all wrong. And others will just implement whatever the government asks.\u201d He has helped run seminars for McDonnell and his team about what to expect from Whitehall, and how to respond. \u201cMy advice is, \u2018If you want to do something new, set up a new unit, and recruit. You\u2019ll get people joining who want to do new things.\u201d But Benn\u2019s experience at the department of industry suggest that outflanking Whitehall\u2019s conservatives may not be that simple. And then there is the business establishment. Since Thatcher, it has become accustomed to deferential governments, to getting its own way over other interest groups, and to profits and share prices trumping other measures of a company\u2019s economic or social value. The intention of the new economists to end these imbalances has not gone down well. \u201cThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) really hates inclusive ownership,\u201d says one McDonnell ally. \u201cYou can feel the chill whenever we bring it up.\u201d When I asked the CBI for their thoughts on the new economics, there was a week-long silence, and then, after I chased them, a terse statement: \u201cLabour seems determined to impose rules that display a wilful misunderstanding of business.\u201d The new economists say they are not intimidated. \u201cWe in the movement need to be absolutely frank about this,\u201d says Guinan. \u201cA democratic and an exploitative economy are fundamentally incompatible. We should mount a straightforward, left-populist attack on these business interests. We should say to them: \u2018Off you go to Singapore!\u2019 The left shouldn\u2019t be afraid of a little creative destruction\u201d, he says, cheekily borrowing a phrase usually used by free-marketeers. Jacobs agrees: \u201cExploitative companies can go to the wall.\u201d That might sound like a reckless leftwing fantasy. But the new economists argue convincingly that hugely disruptive change is coming to the British economy, anyway \u2013 thanks to Brexit, automation and the climate emergency. \u201cBrexit alone will require a very interventionist state\u201d to help the economy adapt, says Lawrence. \u201cIt will make it much harder for a civil servant to say, \u2018You simply can\u2019t do that.\u2019\u201d * * * But what do the new economists want to come after neoliberal capitalism? In Preston, after Brown had spoken evangelically to me about the virtues of \u201clocal businesses\u201d and \u201clocal jobs\u201d, I asked whether his council was actually saving capitalism in the city \u2013 by making it more socially sensitive \u2013 rather than supplanting it. For once, he paused. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be pragmatic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still in a free-market environment. And I don\u2019t see local businesses as big capitalists, anyway. The vast majority only have one or two people working for them. There\u2019s almost no one to exploit. Shareholders are not involved.\u201d Not everyone on the left would see small businesses \u2013 often keen supporters of rightwing parties and austere social and economic policies \u2013 in such benign terms. But Brown went on: \u201cThe Labour party, nationally, is getting away from the old pro-business/anti-business argument. Creating social value is what matters.\u201d Later I asked McDonnell, too, whether his approach risked saving rather than replacing capitalism. He smiled, and went into the gnomic mode he adopts when talking about tricky issues. \u201cWho incorporates who ...\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate!\u201d Then his smile turned more mischievous. A Corbyn government, he said, would \u201cwelcome\u201d business \u201cinto our warm embrace\u201d. The McDonnell ally I spoke to said that whenever the question of the economy\u2019s long-term trajectory came up in Labour discussions, \u201cWe avoid that conversation. There is no consensus in the party.\u201d Then he added: \u201cPersonally, I\u2019d be quite happy if Britain ended up as Denmark.\u201d McDonnell often cites Germany as another country where capitalism is more benign. Wainwright, who has known McDonnell for decades, has a usefully flexible prediction about what might happen to Britain\u2019s economic culture if he becomes chancellor. \u201cEn route to a socialist society,\u201d she says, \u201cthere might be moments when a different capitalism emerges\u201d \u2013 ie, a more benign one. Yet the problem for the left with settling for \u201ca different capitalism\u201d, however temporarily, is that it may simply enable capitalism to regroup, and then resume its Darwinian progress. Arguably this is exactly what happened in Britain during the last century. After the politically explosive economic slump of the 1930s \u2013 the precursor to today\u2019s crisis of capitalism \u2013 during the postwar years many business leaders seemed to accept the need for a more egalitarian economy, and developed close relationships with Labour politicians. But once the economy and society had been stabilised, and rightwingers such as Thatcher started making a seductive case for a return to raw capitalism, the businessmen switched sides. Another difficulty for the new economists and their political allies is to persuade voters \u2013 brought up with the idea that profit and growth are the only economic outcomes that matter \u2013 that other values should matter more from now on. Even saving the environment is still a hard sell. \u201cThe effect of economic growth on the planet is not an issue that\u2019s talked about nearly enough on the left,\u201d admits Berry. \u201cAs for de-growth\u201d \u2013 the current green term for dropping growth as an economic objective \u2013 \u201cthe Labour party won\u2019t touch it with a bargepole.\u201d McDonnell\u2019s ally agreed. \u201cDe-growth,\u201d he said, \u201cis just appalling labelling.\u201d Guinan says the problem is not just presentational: \u201ca politics of de-growth has not yet been invented that will carry the public.\u201d Instead, Labour have recently begun promoting a version of the Green New Deal: an enticing but still largely theoretical scheme advocated by steadily more leftists and environmentalists in Britain and the US over the past decade. It aims to address the climate emergency and some of capitalism\u2019s problems simultaneously, by a huge increase in government support for green technologies and the highly skilled, hopefully well-paid jobs needed to create them. In a speech this week, McDonnell said that this project needed to be Britain\u2019s biggest peacetime undertaking since the Attlee government\u2019s conversion of the economy from war to peace during the 40s. In April, the shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey, a McDonnell protege, wrote a Guardian article advocating a \u201cgreen industrial revolution\u201d, including \u201cdeep-water turbines in the North Sea\u201d, which \u201ccould provide four times Europe\u2019s entire electricity demand\u201d and \u201ccould be built and delivered from the UK\u201d. It was quite a thrilling vision; but the turbines were the only potential new technology the article mentioned. Another enormous issue that the new economists often skirt is whether many of today\u2019s workers really want more of a voice in their workplaces. When \u201cindustrial democracy\u201d was last a popular idea on the left, in the 70s, work was arguably more fulfilling and central to people\u2019s lives than it had ever been before. Office jobs were replacing factory jobs, work was a strong engine of social mobility, and membership of powerful trade unions had accustomed the majority of British employees to being consulted, of having some agency in their working lives. But in 2019, empowering experiences at work are less common. For more and more people, however well-qualified, employment is short-term, low-status, unrewarding \u2013 barely part of their identity at all. Gordon-Farleigh has spent years trying to interest people in forming co-operatives, and not always succeeding. \u201cContemporary capitalism has produced a pacified, passive workforce,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people even like to feel a bit alienated by capitalism \u2013 to not really understand how it works. They need to be reskilled, politically. Then we have to look at what economic powers they actually want.\u201d * * * In April, after waiting for a pause in the seemingly endless winter of Brexit arguments, Mathew Lawrence launched a new economics thinktank, Common Wealth, which aims to draw all the strands of the movement together, with an evening event in London. After an uplifting but slightly too slick film about Common Wealth\u2019s mission had been shown on a big screen \u2013 which was similar in tone and content to a recent Labour party political broadcast called Our Town \u2013 Lawrence was introduced to the audience by Guinan. In the speech that followed, Lawrence covered so much ground that his voice became a mutter, too fast for anyone unfamiliar with the new economics to follow. During this formal bit of the evening, Common Wealth risked feeling like a project for insiders \u2013 just another London thinktank, with the former Labour leader Ed Miliband on its board. Yet the rest of the launch felt different. The hired room was in the East End, far from the usual thinktank belt around Westminster, and it was packed, and loud with earnest talk. Almost everyone was in their 20s or 30s, many of them with scuffed Dr Martens shoes and austere modern haircuts \u2013 the now-familiar sight of British millennials gathering to discuss changing the world. Two hours after the start of the event, people were still arriving, and hardly anyone had left. When I did, just before 11, the lights were still on in the nearby office towers of the City of London, which overshadows the East End, and the economy of the whole country beyond. But walking away from the buzzing room, especially after a bottle of the Common Wealth craft ale that had been made for the occasion, it was possible to believe that the bankers\u2019 best days might be numbered, and that the new economics would tell us how. \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here.",

And though the old, male Tory members may think it\u2019s irrelevant, they may note that Johnson\u2019s lead with real voters fell eight points in a day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5bacb49c-bb72-44c9-9b99-58f68ecebc05\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KVvvyo3U5RE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The party has changed, that\u2019s clear: Bale finds members\u2019 Brexit position has hardened considerably since 2015, reinforced by 30,000 new hard leavers. Here\u2019s the crunch: 84% are opposed to a referendum and two-thirds are for leaving the EU with no deal \u2013 ready to sacrifice the union, the economy and their own party. Out in the real world, only a quarter of voters want a no-deal Brexit. For more than 18 months YouGov founder Peter Kellner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/20/polls-stay-eu-yougov-brexit-peoples-vote\" title=\"\">has recorded a majority</a> who now think the referendum result was wrong. For a year there has been an eight-point lead for remain, among all polls. This has become a remain-majority country. This seminal fact \u2013 mostly due to Labour voters changing their minds, plus the older, more pro-Brexit voters dying, and the young, more remain, entering the register \u2013 is missing from most public discussion. Why?</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/survation/new-polling-on-conservative-party-leadership-westminster-voting-intention-boris-johnson-1121275?e=%5BUNIQID%5D\" title=\"\">Survation poll</a> for the Mail on Sunday found 54% for remain, 46% for leave. Did you miss that? That\u2019s because the Brexit-backing paper omitted it from its report, but it\u2019s on the Survation site. Also missing was Survation\u2019s Westminster result: Labour in the lead on 26%, Tories 24%, Brexit party 20%, Liberal Democrats 18%. Add in 11% for the Greens, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru combined, and in total remainers are well ahead of the leavers.</p> \n<p>Yet the UK is in mortal danger of being dragged into a no-deal Brexit against its will, with no vote, no say. Where is the rebellion against this democratic outrage? Instead we get dishonesty about obeying a long-defunct \u201cwill of the people\u201d plus Hunt\u2019s surprisingly frank confession on the Radio 4 Today programme that there will be no election as it would put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. A referendum is resisted for the same reasons: Brexit would lose.</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet today debates its miserable non-position again, as the admirable Another Europe is Possible campaign has already galvanised 300 local associations to send motions to conference demanding a switch to a \u201cremain, reform, revolt\u201d referendum stance. Corbyn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jun/24/tory-leadership-latest-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt-calls-boris-johnson-a-coward-for-dodging-tv-debates-and-interviews-live-news\" title=\"\">was consulting trade unions</a> yesterday: YouGov shows trade unionists overwhelmingly back a remain referendum.

Now Theresa May says the next prime minister can avoid scrutiny by the Commons until September.</p> \n<p>Labour should be ready for an election soon, as both Tory remain rebels and StandUp4Brexit MPs from the European Research Group pledge to pull down a Johnson government if he deviates either way.

But even that goes unchallenged, as Sky News cancels the last debate before postal ballots go out, shut down by Johnson\u2019s cowardly funk, shamelessly dodging scrutiny. What a mockery, even of this bogus electorate. \u201cMan up,\u201d says Hunt to Johnson, trying to coax the frit old lion out of his cave: \u201cman\u201d it is, women irrelevant. Here\u2019s Prof Tim Bale\u2019s latest analysis for the BBC of the Tory membership voting on behalf of us 65 million: 70% are men, 97% white, 60% southern, 86% higher social classes, average age 57, a high proportion no longer in work. Six out of 10 want the death penalty back. These are oddballs. They are not Britain, these members who booed Iain Dale for asking Johnson to explain the shouting from his partner\u2019s flat, loud enough to be heard from the street with her yelling \u201cGet off me!\u201d and \u201cGet out of my flat!\u201d Women want to know. And though the old, male Tory members may think it\u2019s irrelevant, they may note that Johnson\u2019s lead with real voters fell eight points in a day. The party has changed, that\u2019s clear: Bale finds members\u2019 Brexit position has hardened considerably since 2015, reinforced by 30,000 new hard leavers. Here\u2019s the crunch: 84% are opposed to a referendum and two-thirds are for leaving the EU with no deal \u2013 ready to sacrifice the union, the economy and their own party. Out in the real world, only a quarter of voters want a no-deal Brexit. For more than 18 months YouGov founder Peter Kellner has recorded a majority who now think the referendum result was wrong. For a year there has been an eight-point lead for remain, among all polls. This has become a remain-majority country. This seminal fact \u2013 mostly due to Labour voters changing their minds, plus the older, more pro-Brexit voters dying, and the young, more remain, entering the register \u2013 is missing from most public discussion. Why? A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found 54% for remain, 46% for leave. Did you miss that? That\u2019s because the Brexit-backing paper omitted it from its report, but it\u2019s on the Survation site. Also missing was Survation\u2019s Westminster result: Labour in the lead on 26%, Tories 24%, Brexit party 20%, Liberal Democrats 18%. Add in 11% for the Greens, Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru combined, and in total remainers are well ahead of the leavers. Yet the UK is in mortal danger of being dragged into a no-deal Brexit against its will, with no vote, no say. Where is the rebellion against this democratic outrage? Instead we get dishonesty about obeying a long-defunct \u201cwill of the people\u201d plus Hunt\u2019s surprisingly frank confession on the Radio 4 Today programme that there will be no election as it would put Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. A referendum is resisted for the same reasons: Brexit would lose. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet today debates its miserable non-position again, as the admirable Another Europe is Possible campaign has already galvanised 300 local associations to send motions to conference demanding a switch to a \u201cremain, reform, revolt\u201d referendum stance. Corbyn was consulting trade unions yesterday: YouGov shows trade unionists overwhelmingly back a remain referendum. (Except Labour\u2019s biggest donor, Len McCluskey of Unite.) Labour\u2019s failure to take the strong remain stand that growing numbers of its shadow cabinet, and most members, support leaves an empty chair where Labour should be. How profoundly depressing that Corbyn-backing Momentum has proposed 10 conference motions but not a single one refers to Brexit. Each day more phoney \u201csolutions\u201d to the Tories\u2019 Brexit dead end pour out: Labour should be out there knocking them down like skittles. Johnson\u2019s waffly claim that there could be \u201ca standstill in our current arrangements under Gatt 24, or whatever it may be\u201d, has been blown out of the water by every expert, including the Brexit-backing attorney general, Geoffrey Cox. It shows how far the party has galloped into fantasy land when Liam Fox, who used to be the furthest extreme, now ranks among the sensibles, dismissing Johnson\u2019s Gatt 24 line. \u201cIt isn\u2019t true\u201d he says; no deal means no implementation time; and yes, all World Trade Organization tariffs apply immediately, 10% on cars, 40% on meat and other produce. Nicky Morgan\u2019s \u201calternative arrangement\u201d yesterday was an imaginary side-deal between the UK and Ireland to let food travel freely across the border: it too was instantly exposed as balderdash by trade experts. Both Hunt and Johnson boast of magic EU negotiating tactics and wizard border wheezes; neither has yet been stripped naked of such nonsense by relentless grilling. Now Theresa May says the next prime minister can avoid scrutiny by the Commons until September. Labour should be ready for an election soon, as both Tory remain rebels and StandUp4Brexit MPs from the European Research Group pledge to pull down a Johnson government if he deviates either way. Nigel Farage yesterday proposed a pact with the Tories that would deliver a devastating hard Brexit crash-out. This could see the remain majority crushed by a minority Tory/Farage Brexit machine. The only salvation would be the remain parties knocking all heads together to fight as an anti-Brexit alliance. \u2022 Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist \u2022 This article was amended on 25 June 2019. An earlier version said that a recent Survation poll showed the Liberal Democrats had 8% support. This has been corrected to 18%.",

Lead-based paint remains the most significant and dangerous source for children, the CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/sources.htm\">says</a>, but drinking water can be another major source of exposure. Lead enters drinking water when pipes containing lead corrode. It is <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/694853.pdf\">not known</a> how many lead pipes still exist in America\u2019s water systems. A 2016 EPA report estimated 6.5 to 10m homes had lead service lines.</p> <p>Water accounts for about 20% of lead exposure, according to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water\">EPA</a>, but the agency estimates that, for infants fed on formula, that number jumps to 40-60%.</p> <p>Even though drinking water might meet the regulatory standards of the EPA, there may still be lead present. According to the Lead and Copper Rule, set in 1991, the agency only requires public water systems to take action if lead exceeds 1<em>5 </em>parts per billion<em>. </em>That so-called \u201caction level\u201d was not <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-01/documents/ndwaclcrwgfinalreportaug2015.pdf\">based</a> on health <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/08/13/489825051/lead-levels-below-epa-limits-can-still-impact-your-health\">effects</a>, but on practical considerations of how utilities could control corrosion. The EPA\u2019s maximum contaminant level <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/basic-information-about-lead-drinking-water\">goal</a> \u2013 a non-enforceable limit based on health effects \u2013 is zero lead in water.</p> <p>The agency is expected to release updates to the Lead and Copper Rule later this summer.</p> <p>Food can also be a source of lead exposure for infants. A 2017 report from the Environmental Defense Fund, a not-for-profit environmental advocacy group, analyzing 11 years of FDA data found lead in 20% of baby food samples (compared to 14% of other foods). In May 2017, the FDA launched the Toxic Elements Working Group to <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/food/conversations-experts-food-topics/what-fda-doing-protect-consumers-toxic-metals-foods\">re-evaluate</a> when FDA should take action on lead found in certain foods, with a focus on food geared towards children.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>Experts say to <a href=\"https://apps.npr.org/find-lead-pipes-in-your-home/en/\">check pipes</a> at home for lead service lines and filter your tap water. Olga Naidenko, senior science adviser for children\u2019s health at the Environmental Working Group, also suggests the estimated 45 million Americans who drink from private wells to test their water for lead and other contaminants, since there are no legal requirements for private well testing. Lindsay McCormick, chemicals and health project manager at the Environmental Defense Fund, advises parents to contact your local utility to ask about lead pipe installation at your house since water tests aren\u2019t always accurate. To reduce exposure, use a water filtration system certified for lead, always use cold water, and let the water from the tap run for at least five seconds before using, a trick that McCormick says significantly <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/edf_child_care_report_01-19.pdf\">reduced</a> lead levels.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/pfas-everyday-products-toxics-guide\">PFAS</a>,</strong> a group of highly persistent chemicals first used to make Teflon, has been found in the drinking water samples of about 16 million Americans. Naidenko says PFAS exposure is especially problematic for infants because of multiple <a href=\"https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/ohat/pfoa_pfos/pfoa_pfosmonograph_508.pdf\">studies</a> linking PFAS to immune suppression and reduced vaccine effectiveness.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>Taking control of other contaminants, like PFAS, is less straightforward. \u201cPFAS removal systems are much more expensive, and that\u2019s why we need community action so the whole water supply gets treated to remove those kinds of chemicals,\u201d says Naidenko.</p> <p>Reverse osmosis filters are most effective at removing PFAS from water, followed by activated carbon filters, according to an analysis of scientific and state agency guidance by <a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/news-and-analysis/2018/09/removing-toxic-fluorinated-chemicals-your-home-s-tap-water\">EWG</a>. University researchers across the country are also <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/05/31/pfas-contamination-forever-chemical/3770012002/\">searching</a> for innovative ways to break down the \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, while the EPA is <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/pfas/draft-interim-recommendations-addressing-groundwater-contaminated-pfoa-and-pfos\">looking into</a> groundwater cleanup methods.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Phthalates</strong>, an endocrine-disrupting group of chemicals used in plastics, cosmetics products and food packaging, among other uses, have <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-05/documents/biomonitoring-phthalates.pdf\">been found</a> in breast milk and infant formula, as well as packaged and fresh foods. Endocrine disrupters have varying health impacts depending on the time of exposure, with fetal development, infancy and early childhood <a href=\"https://endocrinedisruption.org/assets/media/documents/EDC%20Fact%20Sheet%2020180130.pdf\">especially critical</a> windows. In infants and children, phthalates have been <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2017-08/documents/phthalates_updates_live_file_508_0.pdf\">linked </a>to asthma and allergies, male genital deformities and neurodevelopment issues like lowered IQ, ADHD and behavioral problems.</p> <p><strong>BPA</strong>, another prominent endocrine-disrupting chemical found in plastic, was removed from approved use in infant bottles and sippy cups by the FDA in 2012 and formula can linings in 2013 (in both cases, manufacturers said they had already phased out use of the chemical). However, scientists have found common replacement chemicals, such as BPS, have been linked to health effects, <a href=\"http://www.yalescientific.org/2016/08/bpa-free-isnt-always-better-the-dangers-of-bps-a-bpa-substitute/\">including </a>early puberty, disrupted metabolism and thyroid function and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bpa-free-plastic-containers-may-be-just-as-hazardous/\">behavioral</a> effects, among other <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sciencematters/are-bpa-substitutes-any-safer-bpa\">impacts</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>To avoid exposure to BPA replacements, choose glass bottles and food containers. Avoiding phthalates, sometimes called the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/assets/docs/j_q/phthalates_the_everywhere_chemical_handout_508.pdf\">everywhere chemical</a>\u201d can be trickier. Avoid plastic food containers when possible and, if you\u2019re using plastic containers to heat food in the microwave, look for the words \u201cmicrowave-safe\u201d. Read labels and choose products \u2013 including lotions, soaps, shampoos and any plastic items \u2013 that are \u201cphthalate-free\u201d. Choose unscented cleaning and personal care items since phthalates are often found in fragrance ingredients, which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ebd7bb7a36d0b20a4cd6a1567606bb4cfe236be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ebd7bb7a36d0b20a4cd6a1567606bb4cfe236be/0_0_1681_1020/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wooden blocks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"607\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>At home</h2> <p>From furniture to electronics, cleaning products to personal care, the average house contains a range of chemicals that eventually end up in fine particles of dust. Researchers have <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5561392/#R5\">consistently</a> <a href=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/risk/recordisplay.cfm?deid=199243\">shown</a> that infants and young children have the highest exposure to chemicals in household dust because of their behavior \u2013 like spending more time on the floor and putting things in their mouth \u2013 and because of physiological differences like higher breathing rates.</p> <p><strong>Flame retardants </strong>have been linked to neurodevelopmental problems, endocrine disruption and cancer, among other serious health concerns. The CDC has <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/PBDEs_FactSheet.html\">found </a>that flame retardants show up in Americans\u2019 blood samples at three to 10 times the levels of Europeans. They can be found in foam used in crib mattresses, high chairs, car seats and more. The chemicals, which have a <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-met-flames-science-20120509-story.html\">dubious record</a> of actually slowing fire, are also found in children\u2019s pyjamas. Even as the most demonstrably harmful types of flame retardants have been phased out, they are persistent chemicals that remain in the environment for years.</p> <p>The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says <a href=\"https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/ToxProfiles/tp207-c1-b.pdf\">studies </a>have shown that infants\u2019 and young children\u2019s bodies have higher levels of PBDEs, a type of flame retardant, than older children and adults. The youngest populations are believed to take in more of the chemical through soil and dust residue and breast milk. PBDEs may also be more concentrated in babies and young children because they have a higher chemical to body weight ratio.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>Experts advise parents to <a href=\"https://www.ceh.org/wp-content/uploads/Shopping-Guide-English-WEB.pdf\">avoid products</a> with polyurethane foam, which contains flame retardants, and look for natural fibers instead. The EWG<a href=\"https://www.ewg.org/healthyhomeguide/mattresses/\"> recommends</a> an organic crib mattress with a natural covering, like cotton or wool, instead of PVC or vinyl.</p> <p>Clearly, the cost is an issue for many families seeking less harmful products, says Linda McCauley, dean and professor at Emory\u2019s Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. \u201cIf you\u2019re living at the poverty level, you might go to places like Goodwill to buy used baby furniture, used car seats and mattresses,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where the ethical dilemma is: they have access to these affordable things for their families, but these old, used products are more likely to have the chemicals that are now banned.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>A 2017 analysis by researchers from the George Washington University and the NRDC found <strong>phthalates</strong> to be widespread in household dust samples. The chemicals are found in scented cleaning and personal care products, as well as vinyl flooring. While certain phthalates were banned from children\u2019s toys in 2008, health researchers <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24425099/\">say</a> little is known about their replacement chemicals, which include other phthalates.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>To reduce household dust and the chemicals found in it, clean surfaces frequently. Wet-mopping or vacuuming with a HEPA filter are thought to be most effective. To reduce chemical exposure from <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/detox-me-app-tips-healthier-living/tips-cleaning\">cleaning</a>, choose products that are naturally derived and fragrance-free, or stick to baking soda, vinegar and castile soap. Parents can also switch to personal care products that are paraben- and phthalate-free to reduce infant exposure to these endocrine disrupters.</p> </blockquote> <p>Higher exposure to various <strong>pesticides </strong>\u2013 especially harmful for developing children and linked to asthma, cancer, endocrine disruption and other issues \u2013 is a known problem in agricultural areas and children can be <a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/6/e1757\">exposed</a> through <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3414435/\">spray drifts</a> in the air or from pesticide residues brought <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1354750X.2017.1395080\">home </a>by a farmworker parent. At-home pesticide use in the garden or home can also expose children, even from applications in years past.</p> <p>Researchers from Emory University\u2019s Center for Children\u2019s Health, the Environment, the Microbiome, and Metabolomics, the first major study to examine environmental exposures of pregnant African American women and their babies in the urban south-east, found pesticide levels in the homes of pregnant African American women in Atlanta to be on par with agricultural areas. McCauley says organophosphate pesticides, thought to be especially harmful to children, were found in study participants\u2019 homes, probably from termite insecticides. \u201cOnce you spray an apartment with these chemicals, particularly organophosphates, they don\u2019t break down quickly. They stay cloistered in carpets and on furniture,\u201d she says.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>Consider other pest control methods before resorting to pesticides at home. If you do use pesticides, choose products lowest in toxicity (organizations like the <a href=\"http://npic.orst.edu/health/minexp.html\">National Pesticide Information Center</a> can help) and keep pets and children off treatment areas for the period listed on the label. Use products with the lowest toxicity if you do need chemical pesticides. Ensure all pesticide-containing products \u2013 including disinfecting cleaners, bleach and flea and tick shampoos \u2013 are <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/roombyroom-checklist.pdf\">stored</a> out of children\u2019s reach.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d8a2362035eb519d751aded51c191dd70dfaaf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d8a2362035eb519d751aded51c191dd70dfaaf4/11_0_3277_1967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"swing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>At daycare</h2> <p>Many of the same chemical concerns at home also apply to childcare facilities.</p> <p>Nap mats with polyurethane foam<strong> </strong>contain<strong> flame retardants. </strong>A recent<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749118302690?via%253Dihub\">study</a> by researchers from Indiana University and Toxic-Free Future, an environmental health advocacy group, found swapping out nap mats with safer alternatives at a small sample of daycare centers reduced flame retardant particles in dust samples by up to 90%.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>What can parents do?</strong></p> <p>Toxic-Free Future, a research and advocacy group focused on phasing out highly toxic chemicals, is <a href=\"https://toxicfreefuture.org/tips-flame-retardants/\">pushing</a> for policymakers and manufacturers to stop the use of flame retardants in nap mats and many other products. In the meantime, the organization advises parents to advocate for stricter standards, check the labels on kid\u2019s products labels and wash hands regularly.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Pesticides, </strong>used to repel insects and rodents and maintain outdoor spaces<strong>,</strong> are also a concern for daycare facilities. The EPA has <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/documents/IPM_CCC.pdf\">noted</a> infants and small children are most likely to suffer long-term harm from pesticides because they are more vulnerable and more exposed.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>The AAP <a href=\"https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/all-around/Pages/Protecting-Children-from-Pesticides-Information-for-Parents.aspx\">advises</a> parents to work with schools and government agencies to encourage the use of less toxic pesticides. The EPA recommends childcare facilities use an \u201cintegrated pest management\u201d strategy to reduce the use of toxic pesticides. Some pesticides are restricted for use near schools and childcare facilities by state law.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Lead, </strong>too, is a sometimes overlooked concern in daycare centers. Only nine states require childcare facilities to test for lead, leaving about 500,000 childcare facilities unregulated, according to EDF\u2019s McCormick. Last year EDF released a <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/health/tackling-lead-water-child-care-facilities\">report</a> sampling lead at 11 childcare facilities, mostly serving low-income children, and found three out of four water samples were below 1 ppb for lead, but seven of the centers sampled had at least one plumbing fixture that test above EDF\u2019s proposed action level of 3.8 ppb. Lead contamination, said McCormick is \u201cquite widespread, it just may not be at super high, concerning levels everywhere\u201d.</p> <blockquote> <p><em><strong>What can parents do?</strong></em></p> <p>McCormick advises parents to simply <a href=\"https://www.care2.com/causes/what-you-need-to-know-about-lead-in-drinking-water-at-child-care-facilities.html\">ask</a> their childcare facility about their lead pipes. \u201cJust demonstrating the interest and creating the demand can prompt childcare facilities to take action.\u201d She also says smaller childcare facilities located in retrofitted homes or churches are more likely to have lead service lines. The EPA also offers a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2018-09/documents/3ts_for_childcare_draft_final_9_5_2018_508.pdf\">toolkit</a> on lead prevention for childcare providers.</p> </blockquote> <h2>The bottom line</h2> <p>Unavoidable exposure to potentially toxic substances that are part of modern life only adds to the many anxieties of parenting. Environmental and health advocacy groups are pushing for increased regulation or, at least, further testing of many of the chemicals Americans come into contact with daily. But consumer education might also be a key part of the solution.</p> <p>McCauley, who co-leads Emory\u2019s research program studying the complex interaction of the prenatal and postnatal environment, says their outreach efforts to women in the Atlanta region have been welcomed. \u201c[These women] have been so excited about learning about how the environmental exposures might be a window into something going on in their bodies that they\u2019ve never thought about,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The program, <a href=\"http://www.nursing.emory.edu/c-chem2/index.html\">CCHEM2</a>, is part of the network of Centers for Children\u2019s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research, a long-running grant program on children\u2019s health <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01491-1\">cut </a>by the EPA this year. McCauley says future funding is uncertain.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really afraid that this is an area where communities have really benefited from this science, and we need more examples in the US of how science and communities can be linked,\u201d she says.</p> <p><em>Here are organizations offering additional resources on toxic chemicals and tips to reduce risks:</em></p> <ul> <li><p>Silent Spring, an independent research and advocacy group, developed a free mobile app, called <a href=\"https://silentspring.org/detox-me-app-tips-healthier-living\">Detox Me</a>, that draws on 20 years of research for practical advise on everyday chemical reduction.</p></li> <li><p>The University of California San Francisco, a leading research institution on environmental health, also developed a <a href=\"https://peht.ucsf.edu/index.php\">Pediatric Environment</a><a href=\"https://peht.ucsf.edu/index.php\"> Health Toolkit </a>to help parents understand exposure risks and prevention tips.

But beyond the visible, there are more obscure health concerns from additives and contaminants found in unexpected places. Exposure to our environment begins even before birth. Studies have shown that some chemicals, like PFAS and flame retardants, in everyday products can pass from mother to fetus through the umbilical cord, and after birth through breast milk. Socioeconomic status and race also affect lifetime exposure. Minority and low-income individuals are disproportionately affected by pollution and toxic chemicals. A popular phrase in the public health world is that \u201cbabies are not just little adults\u201d. Not only are they developing rapidly, but they are also physiologically different than adults: their organs are not fully developed at birth; they have more permeable skin and don\u2019t metabolize chemicals in the same way, which can make them more vulnerable. So, what is a parent to do? Here are some of the areas of concern experts have flagged and ways to respond to them. In water and food Infants take in more food relative to their body than adults, so substances found in infant formula and baby food can have an outsize effect on developing bodies and brains. Lead, a potent neurotoxin, has long been known to reduce IQ, affect behavior and learning and slow growth, even at low levels. According to the CDC and others, no safe blood lead level has been identified for children. Children are exposed to lead in a variety of ways, through soil and air, as well as consumer products. Lead-based paint remains the most significant and dangerous source for children, the CDC says, but drinking water can be another major source of exposure. Lead enters drinking water when pipes containing lead corrode. It is not known how many lead pipes still exist in America\u2019s water systems. A 2016 EPA report estimated 6.5 to 10m homes had lead service lines. Water accounts for about 20% of lead exposure, according to the EPA, but the agency estimates that, for infants fed on formula, that number jumps to 40-60%. Even though drinking water might meet the regulatory standards of the EPA, there may still be lead present. According to the Lead and Copper Rule, set in 1991, the agency only requires public water systems to take action if lead exceeds 15 parts per billion. That so-called \u201caction level\u201d was not based on health effects, but on practical considerations of how utilities could control corrosion. The EPA\u2019s maximum contaminant level goal \u2013 a non-enforceable limit based on health effects \u2013 is zero lead in water. The agency is expected to release updates to the Lead and Copper Rule later this summer. Food can also be a source of lead exposure for infants. A 2017 report from the Environmental Defense Fund, a not-for-profit environmental advocacy group, analyzing 11 years of FDA data found lead in 20% of baby food samples (compared to 14% of other foods). In May 2017, the FDA launched the Toxic Elements Working Group to re-evaluate when FDA should take action on lead found in certain foods, with a focus on food geared towards children. What can parents do? Experts say to check pipes at home for lead service lines and filter your tap water. Olga Naidenko, senior science adviser for children\u2019s health at the Environmental Working Group, also suggests the estimated 45 million Americans who drink from private wells to test their water for lead and other contaminants, since there are no legal requirements for private well testing. Lindsay McCormick, chemicals and health project manager at the Environmental Defense Fund, advises parents to contact your local utility to ask about lead pipe installation at your house since water tests aren\u2019t always accurate. To reduce exposure, use a water filtration system certified for lead, always use cold water, and let the water from the tap run for at least five seconds before using, a trick that McCormick says significantly reduced lead levels. PFAS, a group of highly persistent chemicals first used to make Teflon, has been found in the drinking water samples of about 16 million Americans. Naidenko says PFAS exposure is especially problematic for infants because of multiple studies linking PFAS to immune suppression and reduced vaccine effectiveness. What can parents do? Taking control of other contaminants, like PFAS, is less straightforward. \u201cPFAS removal systems are much more expensive, and that\u2019s why we need community action so the whole water supply gets treated to remove those kinds of chemicals,\u201d says Naidenko. Reverse osmosis filters are most effective at removing PFAS from water, followed by activated carbon filters, according to an analysis of scientific and state agency guidance by EWG. University researchers across the country are also searching for innovative ways to break down the \u201cforever chemicals\u201d, while the EPA is looking into groundwater cleanup methods. Phthalates, an endocrine-disrupting group of chemicals used in plastics, cosmetics products and food packaging, among other uses, have been found in breast milk and infant formula, as well as packaged and fresh foods. Endocrine disrupters have varying health impacts depending on the time of exposure, with fetal development, infancy and early childhood especially critical windows. In infants and children, phthalates have been linked to asthma and allergies, male genital deformities and neurodevelopment issues like lowered IQ, ADHD and behavioral problems. BPA, another prominent endocrine-disrupting chemical found in plastic, was removed from approved use in infant bottles and sippy cups by the FDA in 2012 and formula can linings in 2013 (in both cases, manufacturers said they had already phased out use of the chemical). However, scientists have found common replacement chemicals, such as BPS, have been linked to health effects, including early puberty, disrupted metabolism and thyroid function and behavioral effects, among other impacts. What can parents do? To avoid exposure to BPA replacements, choose glass bottles and food containers. Avoiding phthalates, sometimes called the \u201ceverywhere chemical\u201d can be trickier. Avoid plastic food containers when possible and, if you\u2019re using plastic containers to heat food in the microwave, look for the words \u201cmicrowave-safe\u201d. Read labels and choose products \u2013 including lotions, soaps, shampoos and any plastic items \u2013 that are \u201cphthalate-free\u201d. Choose unscented cleaning and personal care items since phthalates are often found in fragrance ingredients, which companies aren\u2019t required to disclose. At home From furniture to electronics, cleaning products to personal care, the average house contains a range of chemicals that eventually end up in fine particles of dust. Researchers have consistently shown that infants and young children have the highest exposure to chemicals in household dust because of their behavior \u2013 like spending more time on the floor and putting things in their mouth \u2013 and because of physiological differences like higher breathing rates. Flame retardants have been linked to neurodevelopmental problems, endocrine disruption and cancer, among other serious health concerns. The CDC has found that flame retardants show up in Americans\u2019 blood samples at three to 10 times the levels of Europeans. They can be found in foam used in crib mattresses, high chairs, car seats and more. The chemicals, which have a dubious record of actually slowing fire, are also found in children\u2019s pyjamas. Even as the most demonstrably harmful types of flame retardants have been phased out, they are persistent chemicals that remain in the environment for years. The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry says studies have shown that infants\u2019 and young children\u2019s bodies have higher levels of PBDEs, a type of flame retardant, than older children and adults. The youngest populations are believed to take in more of the chemical through soil and dust residue and breast milk. PBDEs may also be more concentrated in babies and young children because they have a higher chemical to body weight ratio. What can parents do? Experts advise parents to avoid products with polyurethane foam, which contains flame retardants, and look for natural fibers instead. The EWG recommends an organic crib mattress with a natural covering, like cotton or wool, instead of PVC or vinyl. Clearly, the cost is an issue for many families seeking less harmful products, says Linda McCauley, dean and professor at Emory\u2019s Nell Hodgson Woodruff School of Nursing. \u201cIf you\u2019re living at the poverty level, you might go to places like Goodwill to buy used baby furniture, used car seats and mattresses,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is where the ethical dilemma is: they have access to these affordable things for their families, but these old, used products are more likely to have the chemicals that are now banned.\u201d A 2017 analysis by researchers from the George Washington University and the NRDC found phthalates to be widespread in household dust samples. The chemicals are found in scented cleaning and personal care products, as well as vinyl flooring. While certain phthalates were banned from children\u2019s toys in 2008, health researchers say little is known about their replacement chemicals, which include other phthalates. What can parents do? To reduce household dust and the chemicals found in it, clean surfaces frequently. Wet-mopping or vacuuming with a HEPA filter are thought to be most effective. To reduce chemical exposure from cleaning, choose products that are naturally derived and fragrance-free, or stick to baking soda, vinegar and castile soap. Parents can also switch to personal care products that are paraben- and phthalate-free to reduce infant exposure to these endocrine disrupters. Higher exposure to various pesticides \u2013 especially harmful for developing children and linked to asthma, cancer, endocrine disruption and other issues \u2013 is a known problem in agricultural areas and children can be exposed through spray drifts in the air or from pesticide residues brought home by a farmworker parent. At-home pesticide use in the garden or home can also expose children, even from applications in years past. Researchers from Emory University\u2019s Center for Children\u2019s Health, the Environment, the Microbiome, and Metabolomics, the first major study to examine environmental exposures of pregnant African American women and their babies in the urban south-east, found pesticide levels in the homes of pregnant African American women in Atlanta to be on par with agricultural areas. McCauley says organophosphate pesticides, thought to be especially harmful to children, were found in study participants\u2019 homes, probably from termite insecticides. \u201cOnce you spray an apartment with these chemicals, particularly organophosphates, they don\u2019t break down quickly. They stay cloistered in carpets and on furniture,\u201d she says. What can parents do? Consider other pest control methods before resorting to pesticides at home. If you do use pesticides, choose products lowest in toxicity (organizations like the National Pesticide Information Center can help) and keep pets and children off treatment areas for the period listed on the label. Use products with the lowest toxicity if you do need chemical pesticides. Ensure all pesticide-containing products \u2013 including disinfecting cleaners, bleach and flea and tick shampoos \u2013 are stored out of children\u2019s reach. At daycare Many of the same chemical concerns at home also apply to childcare facilities. Nap mats with polyurethane foam contain flame retardants. A recent study by researchers from Indiana University and Toxic-Free Future, an environmental health advocacy group, found swapping out nap mats with safer alternatives at a small sample of daycare centers reduced flame retardant particles in dust samples by up to 90%. What can parents do? Toxic-Free Future, a research and advocacy group focused on phasing out highly toxic chemicals, is pushing for policymakers and manufacturers to stop the use of flame retardants in nap mats and many other products. In the meantime, the organization advises parents to advocate for stricter standards, check the labels on kid\u2019s products labels and wash hands regularly. Pesticides, used to repel insects and rodents and maintain outdoor spaces, are also a concern for daycare facilities. The EPA has noted infants and small children are most likely to suffer long-term harm from pesticides because they are more vulnerable and more exposed. What can parents do? The AAP advises parents to work with schools and government agencies to encourage the use of less toxic pesticides. The EPA recommends childcare facilities use an \u201cintegrated pest management\u201d strategy to reduce the use of toxic pesticides. Some pesticides are restricted for use near schools and childcare facilities by state law. Lead, too, is a sometimes overlooked concern in daycare centers. Only nine states require childcare facilities to test for lead, leaving about 500,000 childcare facilities unregulated, according to EDF\u2019s McCormick. Last year EDF released a report sampling lead at 11 childcare facilities, mostly serving low-income children, and found three out of four water samples were below 1 ppb for lead, but seven of the centers sampled had at least one plumbing fixture that test above EDF\u2019s proposed action level of 3.8 ppb. Lead contamination, said McCormick is \u201cquite widespread, it just may not be at super high, concerning levels everywhere\u201d. What can parents do? McCormick advises parents to simply ask their childcare facility about their lead pipes. \u201cJust demonstrating the interest and creating the demand can prompt childcare facilities to take action.\u201d She also says smaller childcare facilities located in retrofitted homes or churches are more likely to have lead service lines. The EPA also offers a toolkit on lead prevention for childcare providers. The bottom line Unavoidable exposure to potentially toxic substances that are part of modern life only adds to the many anxieties of parenting. Environmental and health advocacy groups are pushing for increased regulation or, at least, further testing of many of the chemicals Americans come into contact with daily. But consumer education might also be a key part of the solution. McCauley, who co-leads Emory\u2019s research program studying the complex interaction of the prenatal and postnatal environment, says their outreach efforts to women in the Atlanta region have been welcomed. \u201c[These women] have been so excited about learning about how the environmental exposures might be a window into something going on in their bodies that they\u2019ve never thought about,\u201d she says. The program, CCHEM2, is part of the network of Centers for Children\u2019s Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research, a long-running grant program on children\u2019s health cut by the EPA this year. McCauley says future funding is uncertain. \u201cWe\u2019re really afraid that this is an area where communities have really benefited from this science, and we need more examples in the US of how science and communities can be linked,\u201d she says. Here are organizations offering additional resources on toxic chemicals and tips to reduce risks: Silent Spring, an independent research and advocacy group, developed a free mobile app, called Detox Me, that draws on 20 years of research for practical advise on everyday chemical reduction. The University of California San Francisco, a leading research institution on environmental health, also developed a Pediatric Environment Health Toolkit to help parents understand exposure risks and prevention tips. The guide is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and other medical organizations. Healthy Babies, Bright Futures is an alliance of non-profits, scientists and donors that develops programs to reduce babies\u2019 chemical exposure. The group offers guides for parents to limit chemicals in the first few years of a child\u2019s life, beginning before pregnancy.",

Posts by Phoenix officers included one claiming: \u201cIt\u2019s a good day for a chokehold\u201d, while an officer posted a photo of someone in police uniform, fist drawn back mid-punch, along with the words: \u201cI\u2019m going to protect and serve the shit out of you.\u201d On 14 July 2013, one day after Zimmerman was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon \u2013 a black 17-year-old who was unarmed \u2013 one officer wrote: \u201cCongratulations George Zimmerman!!!! Thank you for cleaning up our community one thug at a time.\u201d Last week, Philadelphia police placed 72 officers on desk duty as a result of the Plain View Project\u2019s findings \u2013 the city\u2019s police commissioner said he expected several to be fired \u2013 while in St Louis, the circuit attorney has barred 22 police officers from bringing her cases. The police department of Denison, Florida, has fired one officer and disciplined another. Some of the posts identified by the Plain View Project, which created a searchable database with screengrabs of offending content, included posts making light of police violence, others encouraging vigilantism, and a surprising number endorsing people driving cars into crowds of protesters. \u201cI was surprised and disappointed by the posts,\u201d Baker-White said. \u201c[Officers were] talking about what they would like to do to someone accused of killing a cop or accused of some heinous crime. Also troubling was a number of posts where officers appeared to joke about lying on the stand, especially about police brutality.\u201d The Plain View Project obtained staff lists from eight police departments, in Phoenix; Dallas; Philadelphia; St Louis; York, Pennsylvania; Denison, Texas; Twin Falls, Idaho; and Lake county, Florida. The team then searched for individual officers\u2019 Facebook profiles, and examined all their public postings, considering \u201cwhether these posts or comments could undermine public trust and confidence in police\u201d. \u201cWhen I look at those posts I don\u2019t see them as individual posts at this point,\u201d Baker-White said. \u201cI see them in the aggregate as a body of statements and they seem like they\u2019re part of a larger narrative that exists in American policing, one that at times encourages violence or endorses vigilantism and discriminates against minority communities.\u201d One of the swiftest responses to the Plain View Project findings came last week in St Louis, where the circuit attorney, Kimberly Gardner, permanently barred seven officers identified by the project from bringing her cases to prosecute and barred a further 15 temporarily. It was a St Louis officer who posted the photo of the dog, and the same man went on to write: \u201cF these muslem [sic] turd goat humpers\u201d above an article discussing alleged violence by a Muslim man against police. Other officers published posts criticizing Islam and Black Lives Matter \u2013 including one that compared the movement to the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 and several posted photos of the Confederate flag. \u201cNobody wants to see police officers saying the things that were said there. The community has the expectation that police officers treat everybody with fairness and dignity,\u201d said Susan Ryan, a spokeswoman for the circuit attorney. \u201cSo it\u2019s terribly disheartening and it doesn\u2019t bring anybody any pleasure to read that.\u201d In a statement, the St Louis Metropolitan police department said it had initiated an investigation \u201cimmediately following the publishing of the Plain View Project\u2019s report\u201d. A spokesman said the department would not comment until the investigation was complete. The 72 officers taken off the streets in Philadelphia represent the largest number of police removed from active duty in recent history, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. The Plain View Project identified 1,270 troubling posts made by 330 Philadelphia officers, and a further 2,000 posts from former officers. \u201cHere\u2019s your Maranda [sic] rights,\u201d wrote one Philadelphia officer in a post from 2015. \u201c1. You have the right to shit [sic] the fuck up\u2026..anything you say will cause me to fucking throat punch you.\u201d The post continued by suggesting if the person being arrested could not afford an attorney it was their \u201cfucking fault\u201d. Philadelphia police declined to comment beyond Ross\u2019s remarks. One person identified as a detective with the Philadelphia police linked to a Breitbart article about \u201calt-left antifa extremists\u201d. \u201cIf they show up at any cops [sic] house they should be eliminated,\u201d the detective wrote. Responding to the Plain View Project report in a press conference, the city\u2019s police commissioner, Richard Ross, said the scale of the posts \u201cdefies logic\u201d and \u201cmakes me sick\u201d. \u201cWe are equally disgusted by many of the posts that you saw, and that in many cases the rest of the nation saw,\u201d the Inquirer reported Ross as saying. \u201cWe are in a position to know better.\u201d With more than 100 officers either under investigation or being stripped of duties, the results of the Plain View Project\u2019s work will continue to have ramifications for the eight police departments it investigated. Baker-White said that, for now, there were no plans to explore other departments \u2013 but she could not help but wonder about the scale of the problem. \u201cThey\u2019re just a snapshot from a few police departments,\u201d she said of the posts Plain View identified. \u201cThey\u2019re only comments that were posted publicly and they\u2019re only posts from officers that we were able to find and verify were officers. \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder how much more of this content exists both publicly in jurisdictions we didn\u2019t look at, and privately \u2013 shared with only friends or in private groups \u2013 in the jurisdictions that we did.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Just a minute into its first episode, the ABC\u2019s comedy web series Sarah\u2019s Channel makes two things clear: first, that it\u2019s intimately familiar with the rhythms and affectations of makeup fans who\u2019ve carved a career out of sharing videos on YouTube; and second, that something very dark and catastrophic occurred before the peppy and resilient Sarah \u2013 played by Sydney-born comedian Claudia O\u2019Doherty \u2013 began broadcasting on her webcam. Created by Nick Coyle, with whom O\u2019Doherty began performing as a student in university sketch group Pig Island, the series follows Sarah as she perseveres with her makeup tutorial, product haul and daily routine \u2013 despite being forced to forage for supplies \u201con the surface\u201d. She is surrounded by a grim troupe of post-apocalyptic, evolutionarily stunted humans who view her as a saviour figure, mimicking \u201clike and subscribe!\u201d \u2013 the catchcry of influencers everywhere \u2013 to earn her affection. O\u2019Doherty is intimately familiar with the mannerisms of the beauty vlogger, having procrastinated often in the depths of the YouTube algorithm. She describes what she finds there as \u201csuch a good combination of boring and compelling at the same time\u201d. Since moving to Los Angeles for a role on the Judd Apatow-produced Netflix series Love, O\u2019Doherty has become known for coupling a sweet grin and chirpy punchline with performances that can touch on sad and dark human truths. Her character on Love, Bertie, mirrored her experience as an Australian expat adjusting to a new country \u2013 although O\u2019Doherty\u2019s transition was much smoother than that. \u201cI moved to America when I got the part on Love, and so I had a very cushy situation where I was instantly introduced to people because of the job,\u201d she says. \u201cLooking for a job in Los Angeles seems like the scariest thing to do in the world.\u201d Her journey reads, on paper, like a dream scenario for any hopeful comic, as hard work collided with chance encounters to forge a career she couldn\u2019t have ever predicted.

It is spread through body fluids, which is why carers \u2013 mostly female relatives and nursing staff \u2013 are particularly at risk. It causes fever, aches and diarrhoea and attacks the immune system, causing blood clotting cells to malfunction so that victims bleed extensively and die if their immune system cannot fight off the viral infection.</p>\n    <p>Drugs are still experimental. Patients are isolated and treated by nurses wearing full protective body suits and masks who try to boost their immune response. Friends and relatives are quarantined for 21 days. Prevention measures include washing hands at every opportunity and safe burial practices, with no touching or washing of the body, as is traditional in some cultures.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How does this compare with other outbreaks?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The 2013 and 2016 outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea spread for months through forest regions in west&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/africa\">Africa</a>&nbsp;where Ebola was unknown before the emergency was recognised.

There is an almost total lack of basic services such as power, education, roads, healthcare, and the authority of the government only extends to the edges of urban areas.</p>\n    <p>Police are corrupt, predatory and violent. In rural zones, militia and armed bands provide security and employment opportunities but also steal, rape and kill at will. It is one of the most hostile environments faced by aid and health workers anywhere in the world.</p>\n    <p>Mistrust of officials and foreigners is harming efforts to tackle the disease and conspiracy theories are rampant.

      "bodyText": "Moise Kitsakihu-Mbira has lost his brother, his grandson and 11 other family members to Ebola. When he himself fell sick he sought treatment in secret. His family don\u2019t believe the virus exists and think a man in their village poisoned them. Refusal to believe in the existence of Ebola is one difficulty for doctors who say the current outbreak of the deadly virus in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is the \u201cmost complex public health emergency in history\u201d and warn it could drag on for months. Following two deaths across the border in Uganda two weeks ago, officials admit they are struggling to identify and track cases around the north-eastern city of Butembo, particularly in countryside dominated by the Mai Mai militia and where a highly mobile population mean cases continue to emerge. The outbreak, with more than 2,100 cases and more than 1,412 confirmed deaths in just over a year, is the second largest in history, despite recent availability of an effective experimental vaccine. Centred on three locations in North Kivu \u2013 Beni, Mangina and Butembo \u2013 the response led by the World Health Organization and DRC\u2019s ministry of health faces political security and cultural complexities. Among them is widespread resistance to the idea that Ebola exists, a conspiracy fuelled by some political candidates in last year\u2019s national elections. In Butembo, a population dominated by the Nande ethnic group, a false narrative has also emerged that the virus \u2013 if it exists \u2013 has been brought in from outside to target a people who have long felt victimised in the region\u2019s interminable conflicts. The city has seen armed assaults on Ebola treatment centres, the murder of a WHO doctor, and frequent attacks on vaccination teams. In the latest incident, on Monday last week, a driver working with an Ebola response team in the neighbouring city of Beni was left in critical condition after angry crowds hurled rocks at him and set his vehicle on fire. \u201cWe are looking at one of the most complex health emergencies the world has seen,\u201d says John Johnson of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF), whose teams pulled out of Butembo over security risks. He was one of three officials who framed the crisis in similar terms. Moise Kitsakihu-Mbira is now a motorbike ambulance driver who discreetly brings the sick to the treatment centre from communities where stigma remains. \u201cIt was my grandson who died first,\u201d he tells the Guardian. Many family members touched the body \u2013 highly risky as Ebola is spread through physical contact with victims\u2019 bodies or those showing symptoms. They started dying. First his brother, then, one after another, twelve others. \u201cEven when they were told it was Ebola, the family wouldn\u2019t accept it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey threw stones at the team sent to offer vaccinations. They thought it was poison.\u201d The man accused of poisoning the family was killed by other villagers. Moise did believe in Ebola\u2019s existence and sought treatment when he too fell sick, despite his local doctor telling him that Ebola was not real. \u201cI was telling people that it wasn\u2019t poison,\u201d he recalled. Finally he visited a hospital where Ebola was confirmed. Even then, as he sent texts telling his family where he was, his wife refused the vaccine for herself and their children. * * * Despite its sprawling size and the constant buzz of motorbike taxis, Butembo feels neglected, with potholed dirt roads, open sewers, crumbling infrastructure and its perfect storm of overlapping issues that conspire to hamper the Ebola response. It\u2019s a major commercial centre, and residents trade widely, across the borders into Uganda and Rwanda. Unlike Beni where the main militia \u2013 the Allied Democratic Forces \u2013 are located in the countryside, the Mai Mai are embedded within the population of Butembo, with political links. Even by DRC standards, a strong hostility has emerged here not only to central government but to all outsiders. Dr Ibrahima Soc\u00e9 Fall, the senior WHO official for the Ebola response in Butembo, described the reaction to the arrival of his teams last year in the midst of national elections. Even those who accepted Ebola\u2019s existence were not necessarily happy to see them. \u201cThe view was \u2013 you\u2019re only here for Ebola, and when that is over you\u2019ll go and we will have all the same problems as before.\u201d Conspiracies spiralled. Some centred on the disease, others on the treatment centres. In the midst of this febrile atmosphere the government made the catastrophic decision to cancel voting in the virus-struck region, contributing further to the wildest theories about the outbreak as a political tool. Privately, some of those involved in the medical response also concede that mistakes have been made. Medical teams assumed that the epidemic would follow a similar pattern to recent outbreaks in west Africa, and were blindsided by the hostility and suspicion, recognising too late that political negotiation, as well as medical intervention, was needed. \u201cThe biggest problem has been security. I think if we had the access we need, we could have finished dealing with it a long time ago,\u201d says Soc\u00e9\u2019s colleague Michel Yao, in charge of the day-to-day WHO response. \u201cEvery time there was an incident we would be prevented from working for three to four days. There would be demonstrations and anyone could be attacked. We became the target.\u201d In the most serious incident, on 19 April, Dr Richard Mouzoko Kiboung, a Cameroonian epidemiologist, was killed at Butembo\u2019s University Hospital. According to colleagues, Dr Kiboung was wearing his hospital scrubs but nothing that identified him as working for WHO at the hospital. As he attended a meeting in the conference room, armed men burst into the room. Forcing those present to the floor, the gunmen accused the assembled health workers of \u201cperpetuating false rumours about Ebola\u201d before shooting the doctor in the stomach. Armed assailants also attacked Ebola treatment centres in Butembo and Katwa, then run by MSF, burning parts of the facilities and firing at buildings. This upsurge of violence has forced medical teams to travel with armed escorts and to reinforce clinics with sand-bagged protection. And an atmosphere of risk persists. During the Guardian\u2019s visit to the main coordination centre in Katwa, four men suspected of being Mai Mai militia infiltrated the compound. Two fled and two were arrested by guards.

Meals are delivered to patients in observation areas via slides while in plastic isolation cubes, in controlled environments, doctors work on the most serious cases. There is lodging for relatives, and children are cared for by Ebola survivors immune to catching the virus a second time. There is a morgue and purpose-built screened area where families can view a body ahead of the burial process. Vaccinations have been speeded up and a half dose of vaccine has been found to be as effective as the full shot. It remains exhausting work. \u201cWe have the vaccine and new ways of treating the disease,\u201d says Dr Marie-Claire Kolie, a Guinean doctor in Butembo who worked on Ebola in her own country. \u201cThe big difference is that this is occurring in a conflict zone and that is accentuating everything.

      "bodyText": "In 2018, Meiliana, a Chinese Indonesian living in Sumatra, was jailed. Her crime? A complaint to a neighbour about the volume of the call to prayer at her local mosque. Meiliana, who is Buddhist, was released last month on parole. Yet the fallout over the case remains. Not only did her objections lead to an anti-Chinese riot and the burning of several Buddhist temples in a country still riven by ethnic tensions; it reveals the damaging reach of Indonesia\u2019s controversial blasphemy law. Now the debate has made its way to Canberra \u2013 through art. In Wall of Tolerance \u2013 one of 50 plus works currently showing in Contemporary Worlds: Indonesia at the National Gallery of Australia (NGA) until October \u2013 a brick wall is peppered with gilded brass ears. At first the wall seems quiet. But lean in close and the ears emit the sounds of a call to prayer, recorded by artist Agus Suwage in his own neighbourhood. \u201cOne of the things you first hear in Indonesia is that incredible noise \u2013 you\u2019re relying on hearing as well as sight to navigate,\u201d says the NGA\u2019s Jaklyn Babington, who curated the exhibition. In Indonesia, the call to prayer, she adds, has become \u201cliterally a competition for airspace\u201d. Contemporary Worlds: Indonesia is an attempt to grow the NGA\u2019s networks and relationships in the Asia Pacific region. (More than half of the works, which span three generations of artists, have been acquired for its own collection.) But if Contemporary Worlds has a remit beyond a play for soft power with Australia\u2019s most important neighbour, it is to highlight the successes, tensions and fraught history of the world\u2019s third-largest democracy, a vast teeming nation of 260 million people. As Babington puts it, this is an exhibition about \u201csound and silence. What has been historically silenced is actually being vocalised now.\u201d That includes such state-organised violence as the Indonesian mass killings of the mid-1960s, which saw the army murder hundreds of thousands in an anti-communist purge, as well as the wholesale oppression in the same era of Indonesia\u2019s ethnic Chinese minority under the military dictator Suharto, who banned the public use of Mandarin and its teaching in schools. Addressing such injustices of the past is FX Harsono, a sixth-generation descendant of Chinese immigrants. Best known for his performance piece Writing in the Rain \u2013 in which the artist pens the characters of his Chinese name on a wall, only to see them washed away \u2013 Harsono has erected his work, Gazing on Collective Memory, at the NGA. A mass of electric candles hang from the ceiling, shining an otherworldly light onto wooden stands that hold photographs and schoolbooks. The installation is a powerful nod towards both the repression of a minority and the triumph of memory. Then there\u2019s Staging Collectivism by Jompet Kuswidananto, in which faceless, bodiless figures \u2013 suggested simply by veils and scattered shoes \u2013 are crammed together in the back of a beaten up truck. Below them dangle mechanical hands. The hands clap, but without sound. Referring to mass mobilisation in Indonesia, as well as the trucks that transported the victims of Suharto\u2019s anti-communist campaign to their deaths, the artwork is more about what is concealed than what is shown. Today, other issues are as pressing. From religious tolerance \u2013 a matter, as the blasphemy law shows, that is far from a given in the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation \u2013 to Indonesia\u2019s battle with pollution and rapid, too fast urbanisation. In her installation work, 1001st Island \u2013 The Most Sustainable Island in Archipelago, Jakarta-based Tita Salina has turned trash, literally, into art. Jakarta Bay is one of the most polluted waterways in the world and, with rising sea levels, the city is rapidly sinking. Both factors put pressure on local fisherman due to declining fish populations. Addressing this, Salina has collected floating plastic and wrapped it in a fishing net to create her own \u201cisland\u201d, which she then released into the bay \u2013 the 1,001st of Jakarta\u2019s Thousand Islands. A net of plastic sits in the NGA, alongside a video where \u2013 defiant and alone, dressed all in black against a bleak industrial waterscape \u2013 Salina stands atop her manmade archipelago. Indeed, in Contemporary Worlds women take centre stage. No artist embodies this more than Melati Suryodarmo\u2019s durational performance Transaction of Hollows. In a blinding white room, 15 viewers at a time are invited in to watch Suryodarmo fire a bamboo arrow from a traditional Javanese bow. Over five hours, she fires 800 times \u2013 drawing and firing, drawing and firing. As the arrow hits the wall it produces a noise, akin to chanting. By the end she is bloodied and exhausted, as are the audience, who themselves become part of the meditation \u2013 an attempt to force us to slow down in an increasingly frenetic, transactional world. As the audience negotiates the space, Suryodarmo moves around them like a slow dance. They will just have to hope that she fires straight. \u2022 Contemporary Worlds: Indonesia is showing at the National Gallery of Australia, Canberra, until 27 October 2019.

      "bodyText": "More than 150 religious leaders have called on Scott Morrison to acknowledge the world faces a climate emergency and block all new coal and gas projects, including Adani\u2019s Carmichael mine. In an open letter headed \u201cno faith in coal\u201d, the leaders say the climate crisis is a profoundly moral problem and Australia\u2019s response will be crucial in addressing it. \u201cSimply put, opening up new coal reserves for mining is not compatible with any global response to avoid catastrophe. We call on you to show true moral leadership,\u201d the letter says. Signatories to the letter include bishops, rabbis, theologians, the grand mufti of Australia and the heads of the Uniting Church, the Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils, Muslims Australia and the National Council of Churches. It asks the prime minister to make the climate emergency his number one priority and endorses the three demands of protesting school students: stopping the Adani mine in central Queensland, not allowing new coal or gas developments and moving Australia to run entirely on renewable energy by 2030. \u201cDespite the differences in our faith, we all regard addressing the climate emergency as our shared moral challenge. We stand together for our common home, the Earth,\u201d the letter says. \u201cWill you and your government have the courage to agree to this simple threefold agenda? We pray that you will.\u201d The letter was organised by advocacy group the Australian Religious Response to Climate Change. It concedes the shift will be challenging, not least for people in communities reliant on fossil fuel industries, but says a courageous leader would come up with a jobs plan based on clean energy. Loreto Sister Libby Rogerson said burning fossil fuels was worsening extreme weather, crop failures and sea level rise. By continuing the practice, Australia was moving further away from \u201cloving God and God\u2019s creation and loving our neighbour\u201d, she said. \u201cWe have a sacred responsibility to care for the Earth and all living beings, especially the vulnerable people on the frontlines,\u201d she said. The letter was published shortly after City of Sydney became the latest jurisdiction to declare a climate emergency. Councillors unanimously backed a motion by the lord mayor, Clover Moore, on Monday warning the climate crisis poses a serious risk to Sydneysiders. Noting Australia\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have increased four years straight, Moore called on the Morrison government to respond urgently by reintroducing a price on carbon and establishing a body to help workers in fossil fuel industries to transition to other jobs. \u201cSuccessive federal governments have shamefully presided over a climate disaster, and now we are at a critical juncture,\u201d she said. Other cities to have declared a climate emergency include London, Auckland and Vancouver. At a meeting in March, Australia\u2019s capital city mayors called for national action to adapt to the changing climate, including increasing storm severity, extreme heat, drought, floods and bushfire. The government has rejected calls for additional policies to reduce emissions, which began to rise after the Coalition repealed a carbon price scheme in 2014. In a speech to business leaders in Perth on Monday, which focused on reducing regulation, Morrison said: \u201cWe all agree you need to take action on climate change and we\u2019re taking responsible and effective action.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Over an incredible 24-hour period Sunday into Monday, some of Australia\u2019s leading female athletes asserted their dominance on the world stage. Two of them \u2013 Ashleigh Barty and Sally Fitzgibbons \u2013 earned the world No 1 ranking in their respective sports, while the third, Western Australian golfer Hannah Green, took out her first LPGA title \u2013&#xa0;at a major nonetheless.</p> <p>Perhaps the most surprising aspect of these victories isn\u2019t that Australian sportswomen are leading the way. Australia has a long history of female athletes and teams succeeding in the international arena. It is that they continue to do so with significantly less than their male counterparts in terms of resources, pay and prize money.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/24/hannah-green-australias-latest-world-beating-sportswoman\">Hannah Green: Australia's latest world-beating sportswoman | Rod Morri</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barty\u2019s meteoric rise has been well-documented, with the likeable tennis star recording her first grand slam victory at the French Open earlier this month. Her win at the Birmingham Classic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/23/ashleigh-barty-world-no1-tennis\">catapulted Barty to the summit of world tennis</a> and locked her in as the top seed for Wimbledon.</p> <p>Fitzgibbons\u2019 victory in Brazil was the surfer\u2019s first since the Margaret River Pro in 2017, however she chipped away at the top ranking with podium finishes throughout the season to complete an incredible comeback from a shoulder injury suffered in 2018.</p> <p>A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Australian golf legend Karrie Webb, Green had flown under the radar of most Australians before her breakthrough LPGA win in Minnesota. But her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/24/australian-hannah-green-wins-first-major-at-womens-lpga-championship\">surprise one-shot win</a> over incumbent champion Park Sung-hyun was the result of four years of hard work under Webb\u2019s watchful eye.</p> <p>For her efforts on the weekend, Green took home $577,500. That is a significant figure and one that many athletes competing in the AFLW, WBBL and Super Netball could only dream of, but the total available across the LPGA tour is $70m, while the men\u2019s tour will have close to $500m available to golfers.</p> <p>Tennis offers equal prize money for male and female winners in grand slams, but since Wimbledon became the last to offer pay parity in 2007, other tournaments have continued to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/ng-interactive/2018/jul/14/tennis-pay-gap-shouldnt-be-gender-based\">offer more prize money to men</a> throughout the year. This means that Barty\u2019s new world No 1 status will not give her the same earning power as her male counterpart, Novak Djokovic, even if she achieves the same longevity at the top.</p> <p>The World Surf League <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/sep/06/world-surf-league-to-offer-gender-pay-parity-from-next-year\">introduced equal pay</a> for male and female surfers for the first time in 2019 after a wave of pressure mounted in light of a male winner of a junior competition <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jun/28/world-surf-league-criticised-over-gender-pay-gap-for-junior-surfers\">receiving double the prize money</a> of the female winner in the same event.</p> <p>Access to resources continues to be an issue for female athletes \u2013 from junior girls being allocated off-peak time slots and inadequate training facilities all the way up to the French Open semi-finals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/07/rain-delays-force-ashleigh-bartys-first-grand-slam-semi-final-on-to-outside-court\">being played on outside courts</a> while the men\u2019s matches took centre stage.</p> <p>There are always reasons offered up for a lack of equity in pay and resources.

While the Sunday club of champions are full-time athletes, many of their predecessors, not to mention their female counterparts in many team sports in Australia, continue to work part-time jobs while pursuing their sporting ambitions in their free time.</p> <p>While there are certainly differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports, years of conditioning has led many viewers to see the male version as the default. This leads to the belief that the differences women bring to the sport are inferiorities. This belief permeates through all levels of sport and has wide-ranging effects, from an Under-12 girls\u2019 team being pushed out to a later training time to female golfers having less earning potential than their male counterparts.</p> <p>The fact that Australian sportswomen are achieving at the level they are, despite the additional hurdles in their way, demonstrates astounding drive and deep-seated passion for their sport.</p> <p>With Australia now beginning to invest in women\u2019s sport at greater levels than ever before, competitions such as Super Netball are opening doors for women around the world, including those from countries such as Uganda and Malawi, where opportunities to play professional sport are life-changing for women.</p> <p>While there are many more hurdles to scale before women in sport achieve equality, the achievements of the Sunday club are a timely reminder that Australia\u2019s sportswomen are on top of the world and will no longer accept playing second fiddle.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Over an incredible 24-hour period Sunday into Monday, some of Australia\u2019s leading female athletes asserted their dominance on the world stage. Two of them \u2013 Ashleigh Barty and Sally Fitzgibbons \u2013 earned the world No 1 ranking in their respective sports, while the third, Western Australian golfer Hannah Green, took out her first LPGA title \u2013 at a major nonetheless. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of these victories isn\u2019t that Australian sportswomen are leading the way. Australia has a long history of female athletes and teams succeeding in the international arena. It is that they continue to do so with significantly less than their male counterparts in terms of resources, pay and prize money. Barty\u2019s meteoric rise has been well-documented, with the likeable tennis star recording her first grand slam victory at the French Open earlier this month. Her win at the Birmingham Classic catapulted Barty to the summit of world tennis and locked her in as the top seed for Wimbledon. Fitzgibbons\u2019 victory in Brazil was the surfer\u2019s first since the Margaret River Pro in 2017, however she chipped away at the top ranking with podium finishes throughout the season to complete an incredible comeback from a shoulder injury suffered in 2018. A prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Australian golf legend Karrie Webb, Green had flown under the radar of most Australians before her breakthrough LPGA win in Minnesota. But her surprise one-shot win over incumbent champion Park Sung-hyun was the result of four years of hard work under Webb\u2019s watchful eye. For her efforts on the weekend, Green took home $577,500. That is a significant figure and one that many athletes competing in the AFLW, WBBL and Super Netball could only dream of, but the total available across the LPGA tour is $70m, while the men\u2019s tour will have close to $500m available to golfers. Tennis offers equal prize money for male and female winners in grand slams, but since Wimbledon became the last to offer pay parity in 2007, other tournaments have continued to offer more prize money to men throughout the year. This means that Barty\u2019s new world No 1 status will not give her the same earning power as her male counterpart, Novak Djokovic, even if she achieves the same longevity at the top. The World Surf League introduced equal pay for male and female surfers for the first time in 2019 after a wave of pressure mounted in light of a male winner of a junior competition receiving double the prize money of the female winner in the same event. Access to resources continues to be an issue for female athletes \u2013 from junior girls being allocated off-peak time slots and inadequate training facilities all the way up to the French Open semi-finals being played on outside courts while the men\u2019s matches took centre stage. There are always reasons offered up for a lack of equity in pay and resources. From male athletes being bigger, faster and stronger to their matches being longer or their sports bringing in more money and spectators. However much less airtime is given to the fact that men have had the monopoly on marketing, resources and spectators for many years before women\u2019s sport was properly funded or broadcast. While the Sunday club of champions are full-time athletes, many of their predecessors, not to mention their female counterparts in many team sports in Australia, continue to work part-time jobs while pursuing their sporting ambitions in their free time. While there are certainly differences between men\u2019s and women\u2019s sports, years of conditioning has led many viewers to see the male version as the default. This leads to the belief that the differences women bring to the sport are inferiorities. This belief permeates through all levels of sport and has wide-ranging effects, from an Under-12 girls\u2019 team being pushed out to a later training time to female golfers having less earning potential than their male counterparts. The fact that Australian sportswomen are achieving at the level they are, despite the additional hurdles in their way, demonstrates astounding drive and deep-seated passion for their sport. With Australia now beginning to invest in women\u2019s sport at greater levels than ever before, competitions such as Super Netball are opening doors for women around the world, including those from countries such as Uganda and Malawi, where opportunities to play professional sport are life-changing for women. While there are many more hurdles to scale before women in sport achieve equality, the achievements of the Sunday club are a timely reminder that Australia\u2019s sportswomen are on top of the world and will no longer accept playing second fiddle.",

      "bodyText": "The White House declined to make Kellyanne Conway available to testify before the House Oversight Committee. Hundreds of migrant children were moved out of a Texas Border Patrol station where they were being held with inadequate food, water and sanitation. Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson had to clarify her stance on vaccines. Carrying on in a longstanding tradition of this administration, the White House sent oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings a letter today declining \u201cthe invitation to make Ms. Conway available for testimony before the Committee\u201d. President Trump had more to say to the Hill on the sexual assault allegations against him from journalist and advice columnist E Jean Carroll: The article on journalist and advice columnist E Jean Carroll\u2019s sexual assault allegations against President Trump mysteriously disappeared on the New York Post website on Friday afternoon; the wire story by the Associated Press was also scrubbed. Today, CNN is reporting that former editor-in-chief Col Allan - a longtime Trump supporter and \u201cold lieutenant of Rupert Murdoch who returned to the conservative tabloid as an adviser in early 2019\u201d - ordered that the story be removed. Hundreds of children were moved out of a Texas Border Patrol station where they were held with inadequate food, water and sanitation for weeks. At this station, a legal team interviewed 60 children and documented kids forced to take care of kids, no clean clothing, weeks of no baths and poor nutrition. In 2016, President Obama announced the creation of Stonewall National Monument outside the Stonewall Inn in New York, site of the 1969 riot that launched the gay rights movement. It was the first-ever national monument for the LGBT community. Since Obama left office, however, the Trump administration has been fighting to keep the rainbow gay pride flag off of federal lands, according to a cache of internal emails gathered by E&amp;E News. So though Stonewall National Monument remains a national historical landmark recognized by the National Parks Service, the flagpole and rainbow pride flag that still fly outside Stonewall Inn are not technically on federal land. Read the full story here. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi revealed what she told President Trump in asking him to delay the immigration raids: Read here about what the last two years have been like for the children in these communities: Presidential candidate Marianne Williamson had to tweet out a statement on vaccines today after calling mandatory vaccinations \u201ctoo draconian\u201d and \u201ctoo Orwellian\u201d - and then lightly walking that back the next day on the View by expressing a mistrust in \u201cbig pharma\u201d. Former Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs noted Williamson appeared to tweet out and delete another version of the statement that began with \u201cMarianne Williamson\u2019s views on vaccines has been misrepresented in the press\u201d. Hey all, Vivian Ho on the west coast taking over for Lauren Gambino. Happy Monday. Donald Trump slapped a fresh round of sanctions on Iran in response to the downing of a US surveillance drone last week. Tensions remain high even as Trump insists he does not want war with Iran. Bernie Sanders has proposed a new higher education plan that would eliminate virtually all student loan debt. The Treasury Department inspector general will investigate why a decision to put Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill was delayed. The US Treasury Department inspector general will investigate the delay in putting abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill. The review followed a request by Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, who asked the inspector general to look at whether the Trump administration had political motivations for slow-walking the change. Tubman would replace Andrew Jackson, the controversial seventh American president and a political \u201chero\u201d of Trump\u2019s. As president, Jackson supported slavery and implemented the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which forced Native Americans off their land and led to what would later be known as the \u201cTrail of Tears\u201d. Donald Trump has signed an executive order that aims to increase transparency for the cost of health services. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to require hospitals and insurers to disclose negotiated rates for services and to provide patients with an explanation of out-of-pocket costs before receiving their services. \u201cThis is a truly big action,\u201d Trump said of the executive order. \u201cSome people say bigger than health care itself.\u201d He added that the order was \u201cbigger than anything we\u2019ve done in this realm\u201d and that it would \u201cfundamentally\u201d change the healthcare marketplace. The plan is likely to face resistance from insurers and hospitals. With 10 candidates on one debate stage, the evening will be less like a debate and far more like a lightening round of questions and answers. Among the topics we expect the candidates to be asked about are their healthcare plans, how they would combat climate change and why a candidate believes he or she can beat Trump. Here\u2019s what we hope the moderators don\u2019t ask. As more Democrats call for impeachment, congresswoman Frederica Wilson makes the case against it. \u201cAmerica: Allow Democrats to investigate, subpoena &amp; expose all. We can beat him @ the ballot box &amp; when he leaves office, justice will prevail,\u201d she writes. Jason Miller, a former top campaign aide and a close advisor to Donald Trump, has left his job at the consulting firm Teneo just days after calling a top-ranking House Democrats a \u201cfat f**k\u201d on Twitter. The post has since been deleted but it appears the damage was done. \u201cI have parted ways with Teneo by mutual consent and look forward to formally announcing my next move in the coming weeks,\u201d Miller said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cTeneo is an incredible firm and without a doubt the premier CEO consultancy on the planet. They have always been great to me and I\u2019m proud to have called them teammates for the past two and a half years.\u201d What is it they say about life imitating art? The first Democratic presidential debates are right around the corner and the candidates are spending every spare moment prepping. Well, most candidates. The New York Times reported that Bernie Sanders is among the candidates \u201cleast interested in participating in intensive pre-debate drills\u201d. Aides told the Times that Sanders has been reading policy briefings but has \u201clittle patience\u201d for mock debates. But for everyone else, especially those lower-polling Democrats hoping for a breakout moment, it\u2019s all about the pre-debate prep. Kirsten Gillibrand is practicing mock debates with aides standing in for the other candidates. Biden is preparing to be ganged up on by the other candidates. Cory Booker is making sure he\u2019s mentally \u2013 and physically \u2013 fit, adding some pushups between practice sessions. Bill DeBlasio, meanwhile, is seeking advice from his son, Dante. Henry Kerner, the chief of the White House\u2019s Office of Special Counsel, who recommended Conway be removed for what the office said was repeated violations of the a law barring federal employees from politicizing their posts. \u201cHer conduct hurts both federal employees, who may believe that senior officials can act with complete disregard for the Hatch Act, and the American people, who may question the nonpartisan operation of their government,\u201d Kerner will tell a congressional panel, according to his testimony obtained by the The Daily Beast . \u201cMs. Conway\u2019s conduct reflects not a misunderstanding of the law, but rather a disregard for it,\u201d the testimony adds. Interesting figures on the changing racial make up of state legislatures: E Jean Carroll, the celebrated advice columnist who has accused Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her in the mid-1990s, has said she is considering bringing a complaint to the New York police department, the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington writes. In a lengthy interview with CNN on Monday, Carroll said she would be open to working with the NYPD in a criminal investigation into the attack she alleges happened in the Manhattan store of Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996. \u201cI would consider it,\u201d she said. However, she added that lawyers had advised her that the statute of limitations deadline by which such a complaint would have had to be brought has expired. Carroll is one of more than a dozen women to accuse Trump of sexual assault and misconduct. A House panel will vote on a subpoena to compel White House counselor Kellyanne Conway to testify about Office of Special Counsel recommendation that she be removed from her posting after repeated violations of the a law barring federal officials from engaging in partisan politics. But that\u2019s not the only effort to hold Conway accountable. Conway has claimed allegations by the independent government agency that she violated the Hatch Act were politically motivated. \u201cYou know what they\u2019re mad about?\u201d Conway said during an appearance on Fox &amp; Friends on Monday. \u201cThey want to put a big roll of masking tape over my mouth because I helped as the campaign manager for the successful part of the campaign.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite a show, folks. The \u2018fiber arts\u2019 strike back. According to the Associated Press, an \u201c8-million strong social network for knitters, crocheters and others in the fiber arts has banned talk of President Donald Trump and his administration.\u201d \u201cThe new policy on Ravelry.com was posted Sunday. The post says the site took the action because it can\u2019t provide a space \u201cinclusive of all and also allow support for open white supremacy.\u201d The post went on to say that support of the Trump administration is \u201cundeniably support for white supremacy.\u201d It remains unclear what prompted the site to take action. Since Trump\u2019s election, knitting has become a popular pastime among members of the so-called \u201cresistance\u201d. There most visible protest was the pink knit \u201cpussy hats\u201d worn during Women\u2019s Marches around the world. The AP recently reported on the alarming conditions that children are being kept in. At a border patrol station in McAllen, Texas, lawyers who had visited the children and adolescents said they were very sick with high fevers, coughing, and \u201cwearing soiled clothes crusted with mucus and dirt after their long trip north.\u201d Congressman Jim Himes has announced his support for beginning an impeachment inquiry. Until this year, Himes was the head of the New Dems coalition, a group of moderate lawmakers that includes many of the newest members of the majority. These are the members who Democratic leaders fear will be hurt by a political backlash to impeachment. In a series of tweets on Monday, Himes explained his decision: \u201cImpeachment is divisive. The politics of impeachment are messy and uncertain, and might, in the short run, serve the President\u2019s narrow political interests. But look at where we are today. Republicans in this chamber cheer or justify or stand woefully silent in the face of behavior for which they would have impeached a Democratic president many times over. Our best and most proven ideas cannot get even a hearing in the Senate. Unless we restore respect for the law, respect for truth and respect for common decency, we cannot hope to solve any of our other pressing problems.\u201d He concludes: \u201cThere are moments for careful calculation. For weighing political expediency and conflicting interests. And there moments for clarity and conviction. This is that moment.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is providing additional details on the sanctions on Iran. The Trump administration has imposed \u201chard hitting\u201d new sanctions on Tehran partly in response to Iran\u2019s downing of an American surveillance drone last week. Trump signed an executive order that he said would continue to squeeze the economy in an effort to bring Tehran to the negotiating table. \u201cThese measures represent a strong and proportionate response to Iran\u2019s increasingly provocative actions,\u201d he said. Last week, Trump approved military strikes after the country shot down an unmanned drone but that he pulled back after determining the attacks was \u201cnot proportionate.\u201d \u201cA lot of restraint has been shown by us,\u201d Trump said before signing the order in the executive office. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to show it in the future but I felt that we want to give [diplomacy] a chance ... I think Iran has a phenomenal future.\u201d Trump added that, being from New York, he has plenty of Iranian friends who he said want to see the country prosper. \u201cWho knows what\u2019s going to happen. I can only tell you that we cannot ever let Iran have a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. The president also accused Iran of responsibility for explosions last week that damaged oil tankers in the vital Strait of Hormuz. Iran has denied its involvement. Trump turned 73 on June 14th. He has previously said that he and Kim Jong Un \u201cfell in love\u201d and they enjoy sending each other snail mail in the form of \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201cexcellent\u201d letters. White House pool reporter John Fritze of USA Today sends this update: \u201cReporters were ushered into the briefing room at around 11:15 a.m. and the door to the briefing room is now locked. Pool can see a dog sweeping the North Lawn, but not much else is visible.\u201d And then there were ... 25. Yes, 25 Democrats are seeing their party\u2019s nomination as of Sunday when former Pennsylvania congressman Joe Sestak announced his presidential campaign. Have you been sleeping on mass movement to draft Sestak into the race? Is there a great clamoring for yet another member of Congress to join the fray? No and no. Maybe this will help explain. From the Washington Post: \u201cSestak first drew national attention in 2010 when he waged a primary challenge against then-Sen. Arlen Specter, who had switched parties to run for reelection as a Democrat. The Obama White House, in an effort to dissuade Sestak from running, dispatched former president Bill Clinton to offer Sestak an unpaid position on a presidential advisory board if he dropped out of the race. Sestak said no. He bested Specter in the primary and later lost to Republican Pat Toomey in the general election. Sestak pursued another Senate bid against Toomey in 2016, during which he walked alone across the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden is also out with a new plan. In an op-ed for the Miami Herald, headlined: Our Latin America policies are morally bankrupt. Mine reflect American values, Biden lays out his vision for immigration reform. The broad strokes of his plan includes: extending citizenship to \u201cDreamers\u201d \u2013 young Americans who came to the US as children, strengthening border security by investing in screening procedures and new technology \u2013 as opposed to a wall \u2013 and easing the migrant crisis by addressing the root causes of poverty, violence and a lack of opportunity throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. Last week gave us more evidence that President Trump\u2019s morally bankrupt re-election strategy relies on vilifying immigrants to score political points while implementing policies that ensure asylum seekers and refugees keep arriving at our border,\u201d Biden writes. \u201cTrump threatened the imminent deportation of millions of undocumented immigrants just hours after his State Department confirmed it was cutting off aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \u2014 the very countries from which most migrants are fleeing. It\u2019s clear Trump is only interested in using his policies to assault the dignity of the Hispanic community and scare voters to turn out on Election Day, while not addressing the real challenges facing our hemisphere.\u201d In 2018, small dollar donations to Democratic candidates and causes skyrocketed thanks in part to a fundraising platform called ActBlue. Republicans today announced their rebuttal: WinRed. According to Politico: \u201cThe new tool is intended to reshape the GOP\u2019s fundraising apparatus by creating a centralized, one-stop shop for online Republican giving, which the party has lacked to this point.\u201d \u2018WinRead\u2019 wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite name for the new platform. \u201cThe most unexpected stumbling block surrounded the initial decision to dub the new product \u2018Patriot Pass.\u2019 The name was abruptly dropped after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft told the president that the processor sounded too much like his football team,\u201d Politico reported. There\u2019s a flurry of Supreme Court decisions this morning: Senator Bernie Sanders is out with a new plan that would eliminate the entire $1.6tn of student debt in the United States. The proposal comes days ahead of the first Democratic debate and as Sanders loses ground to his progressive presidential primary rival, senator Elizabeth Warren, who has captured voter attention with her litany of policy proposals. Warren has introduced a plan that would forgive $640 billion in student debt. According to a preview of Sanders\u2019 plan in the Washington Post, Sanders would eliminate student debt held by 45 million Americans as part of a new proposal that would make public universities, community colleges and trade schools tuition-free. How would he pay for it? WaPo\u2019s Jeff Stein says he would pay for these plans with a \u201ctax on Wall Street that his campaign says will raise more than $2 trillion over 10 years, though some tax experts give lower revenue estimates.\u201d Sanders will introduce the package today alongside progressive House members, including congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Pramila Jayapal. Hello and welcome to Monday\u2019s live politics coverage. Donald Trump has been busy tweeting, telling Iran he has two \u201cvery simple\u201d requests: \u201cNo nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror.\u201d In an early-morning flurry, Trump also told other countries to protect their own Gulf oil shipments, and claimed the US has only limited interest in the region. He also declared that the US is now the world\u2019s biggest energy producer. He wrote: \u201cWhy are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation? All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been a dangerous journey.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe US request for Iran is very simple \u2013 No Nuclear Weapons and No Further Sponsoring of Terror!\u201d Iran insists it does not have a nuclear weapons program. It signed the nuclear deal in 2015, which limited its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief. Trump pulled the United States out of the deal in 2017. In a later tweet, Trump criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates and claimed it \u201cdoesn\u2019t know what it\u2019s doing\u201d.",
