He adopted the name A$AP Rocky when he began his career in 2007, joining the A$AP Mob crew.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>Mayers had a troubled childhood. His elder brother was murdered, his dad was arrested for drug dealing, and he spent some time moving around homeless shelters with his mother and sister. His older sister died of a drug overdose in 2016. Mayers himself served two weeks in prison for drug dealing in 2004.</p>\n    <p>He came to prominence with the release of the mixtape Live.Love.A$AP in 2011.

In 2016, Mayers became the first African-American to be the face of Dior Homme.<br></p>\n    <p>In 2013, he was charged with slapping a woman at Philadelphia's Made in America festival. This was eventually settled out of court in 2015.

To look at Hardy\u2019s contentment, having sacrificed his worldly ambitions (his term) to return to the community in which he grew up and contribute to the greater good (\u201cFrom a selfish point of view I would be happier elsewhere [but without] the peace which I found in this place\u201d), and wonder. Just wonder. Good documentaries, like good Christians, will make you do that.",

A serious attempt against Brazil and its institutions. May they be harshly punished! Brazil is no longer land without law,\u201d he tweeted. The news comes after a political storm was unleashed by a series of articles based on leaked conversations \u2013 mostly on the messaging app Telegram \u2013 between the justice minister, S\u00e9rgio Moro, and other officials. The reports were published by the investigative website the Intercept and Brazilian outlets. They showed that, while still a judge, Moro had advised prosecutors in the corruption prosecution of the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. That sentence removed Lula from the election, after which Bolsonaro named Moro as justice minister. Four people were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly hacking Moro\u2019s phone and others. On Thursday, Folha de S Paulo reported that one of them \u2013 Walter Delgatti Neto \u2013 told federal police that he had anonymously sent the compromising chats from the hacked phones to the Intercept\u2019s founder, Glenn Greenwald, but had not demanded payment.

Neto faces separate court charges of embezzlement, robbery, drug trafficking and use of a false document, Folha reported. Brazilian media has reported that Bolsonaro insists on using a common cellphone instead of the encrypted phone given to him by intelligence services because it does not work with the social media services, such as Twitter and WhatsApp, that he uses so avidly.

      "bodyText": "Boca Juniors have confirmed the signing of Italian midfielder Daniele De Rossi, who has left Roma after 18 years at the club and joins the Argentinian side on a free transfer. De Rossi was received in the early morning at Buenos Aires\u2019 Ezeiza airport and transported to have his medical done immediately. He is expected to join the squad for the first practice on Friday morning, and officially presented on Monday. At 36, many suspected the midfielder would retire as a one-club man when Roma did not renew his contract this summer. But rumours began to fly in May when at a press conference he said: \u201cI still want to play football, it would be unjust to me if I decide to stop now.\u201d Twitter fed that speculation after a picture of De Rossi holding up a Boca kit with his name and number did the rounds. And Boca fans began dreaming when De Rossi reportedly said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to stop playing with the regret of not being able to wear the shirt of Boca.\u201d He will be Boca\u2019s marquee signing of the current transfer window. It is likely De Rossi\u2019s relationship with Boca\u2019s sporting director, Nicol\u00e1s Burdisso, helped the club seal the deal. Burdisso played at centre-back for Roma between 2009 and 2014. Boca also signed winger Eduardo Salvio from Benfica last week. The club\u2019s manager, Gustavo Alfaro, lauded De Rossi and said \u201che\u2019ll add his experience and quality\u201d. De Rossi will be one of the older players in the side, but despite his age, his gritty style will fit in with the Argentinian league. He is a year older than Carlos Tevez, who left Juventus at his peak to join his boyhood club in 2014 after playing in the Champions League final. Argentinian teams are allowed only five spots for international players in each squad, but the prospective exit of Uruguayan midfielder Nahitan N\u00e1ndez to Cagliari, and Colombia-born Frank Fabra being granted Argentinian citizenship, have freed up room for De Rossi. Some remain skeptical of the Italian\u2019s ability and will to perform at his peak, recalling Dani Osvaldo\u2019s overhyped and underwhelming loan spell in 2015 from Southampton via Internazionale. Under Alfaro, Boca Juniors\u2019 formation has varied, but with Tevez mostly sidelined and Cristian Pav\u00f3n linked to an MLS move, Alfaro is likely to stick with the 4-4-1-1 they utilised against Athl\u00e9tico Paranaense on Wednesday. The formation leaves former West Ham playmaker Mauro Z\u00e1rate in an advanced creative position, with two central midfielders behind him. Iv\u00e1n Marcone is first-choice, with De Rossi likely to rotate with the highly rated 19-year-old Agust\u00edn Almendra, adding depth to a squad looking to make a run for the Copa Libertadores. Boca lost the last edition in dramatic fashion to rivals River Plate after two polemic legs and a finale played out in Madrid. After the midweek win in Curitiba, Alfaro said he would expect De Rossi to eventually play alongside Marcone, but admitted he\u2019d \u201chave to see about [De Rossi\u2019s] fitness level\u201d.

You can read his opening statement <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-priorities-for-the-government-25-july-2019\">here</a>. My colleague <strong>Jessica Elgot </strong>has written a summary and analysis of the policy pledges he made in it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-first-speech-as-pm-what-is-he-promising\">here.</a> And I have written about some of the other newsy comments Johnson made later in the session on the blog, including his support for an amnesty for up to 500,000 undocumented migrants (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-new-cabinet-prime-minister-chairs-first-cabinet-as-critics-say-party-now-fully-taken-over-by-hard-right-live-news?page=with:block-5d39abbf8f08d0b6ca5379b9#block-5d39abbf8f08d0b6ca5379b9\"> 2.34pm)</a> and his call for all government cleaners to get the London living wage (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-new-cabinet-prime-minister-chairs-first-cabinet-as-critics-say-party-now-fully-taken-over-by-hard-right-live-news?page=with:block-5d39c2898f0845f89e314434#block-5d39c2898f0845f89e314434\"> 4.09pm)</a>.</p> \n  <p>There was also a lot of political knockabout in the session. Normally this does not get a lot of attention, but it is worth flagging up today because it felt as if we were getting a sneak preview of the Tory autumn election campaign. It also felt as if we were getting a strong hint that there will be an autumn election campaign. When Johnson was talking about policy, he sounded unengaged, but when he was rehearsing attack lines for use against Labour and the SNP, he sounded \u2013 to use his own word \u2013 \u201cenergised\u201d. And in the context of the Commons chamber, he was effective.</p> \n  <p>Five key campaign themes emerged.</p> \n  <p><strong><em>Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign themes</em></strong></p> \n  <p><strong>1) Johnson is explicitly running on a Trump-style \u2018make Britain great again\u2019 platform.</strong> He did not use that slogan, but that nevertheless was the message. Election campaigners often argue that appeals to emotion are more powerful than appeals to reason. And hope is seen as easier to sell than fear (although there are lots of elections where fear wins). Johnson has absorbed these ideas. This is how he started his statement.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Our mission is to deliver Brexit on 31 October for the purpose of uniting and re-energising our great United Kingdom and making this country the greatest place on earth. When I say \u201cthe greatest place on earth\u201d, I am conscious that some may accuse me of hyperbole, but it is useful to imagine the trajectory on which we could now be embarked. By 2050, it is more than possible that the United Kingdom will be the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe, at the centre of a new network of trade deals, which we have pioneered.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>2) He is happy to attack Labour as a remain party.</strong> In his response to Johnson, <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong> called for a referendum on Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans and said Labour would campaign for remain. In his reply, Johnson seized on this, claiming Corbyn had made a strategic error.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>He speaks about trust in our democracy. I have to say that a most extraordinary thing has just happened today. Did anybody notice? Did anybody notice the terrible metamorphosis that took place, like the final scene of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers? At last, this longstanding Eurosceptic, the right honourable gentleman, has been captured. He has been jugulated, he has been reprogrammed by his honourable friends. He has been turned now into a remainer! Of all the flip-flops that he has performed in his tergiversating career, that is the one for which I think he will pay the highest price.</p> \n   <p>It is this party now, this government, who are clearly on the side of democracy in this country.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Theresa May also used to attack Labour for supporting a second referendum. But Johnson did it today with more gusto, and he sought to frame it as an argument not about the EU, but about democracy. It also sounded like an argument you would deploy in an election before the UK had left the EU \u2013 another reason why journalists came away sensing an autumn election was likely.</p> \n  <p><strong>3) Johnson sought to steal Labour\u2019s main party slogan.</strong> Corbyn says Labour is the party for the many, not the few. Today Johnson sought to appropriate this. In his response to Corbyn he also said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The reality now is that we are the party of the people. We are the party of the many, and they are the party of the few. We will take this country forwards; they, Mr Speaker, would take it backwards.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>4) Johnson is going to campaign on an old-fashioned, law-and-order platform. </strong>The independent MP <strong>Chris Leslie</strong> tried to embarrass him by asking him about Priti Patel, the new home secretary\u2019s previous support for the death penalty. Johnson said he did not support it himself, but then he went on the offensive over crime. He told Leslie:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I do not support the death penalty, but what the people of this country want to see is proper sentencing for serious violent and sexual offenders.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He claimed some Labour MPs were nodding, and went on:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are members opposite who know where their constituents truly are on some of these issues, and they are right, unlike the current leadership of the Labour party. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>5) Johnson is challenging Labour to a spending war. </strong>This came when the Labour MP <strong>Meg Hillier</strong> challenged Johnson to explain how his spending promises were affordable. In reply he claimed his proposals were modest and easily affordable. He then challenged Labour to say if they were not prepared to match his spending plans. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If Labour members are now opposing that spending \u2013 if they now think that we should not be putting another \u00a31bn into policing and another \u00a34.6bn into education\u2014then now is the time to speak. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong><em>Labour\u2019s response</em></strong></p> \n  <p>Much of what Johnson said today was implausible, evasive or just downright wrong \u2013 like his reply to Meg Hillier quoted above. <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14212\">(The Institute for Fiscal Studies says his plans are anything but modest.)</a> Many Labour MPs made these points, including <strong>Jeremy Corbyn</strong>, whose <a href=\"https://labour.org.uk/press/10-questions-boris-johnson-refused-answer-parliament/\">opening statement highlighted numerous flaws in Johnson\u2019s case</a>. Corbyn ended up making a sound plea for competence over bluster.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The challenge to end austerity, tackle inequality, resolve Brexit and tackle the climate emergency will define the new prime minister. Instead, we have a hard-right cabinet staking everything on tax cuts for the few and a reckless race-to-the-bottom Brexit. He says he has \u201cpluck and nerve and ambition\u201d; our country does not need arm-waving bluster; we need competence, seriousness and, after a decade of divisive policies for the few, to focus for once on the interests of the many.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But does this message work? It is hard to know without proper polling, but the election of Trump in America showed that reason and truth does not always win over against emotive falsehoods. It felt as if the two Labour MPs who did the most to puncture the Johnson hubris bubble were <strong>Liz Kendall</strong> (see<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-new-cabinet-prime-minister-chairs-first-cabinet-as-critics-say-party-now-fully-taken-over-by-hard-right-live-news?page=with:block-5d3992fb8f0845f89e31418b#block-5d3992fb8f0845f89e31418b\"> 12.32pm)</a> and Hillier (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-new-cabinet-prime-minister-chairs-first-cabinet-as-critics-say-party-now-fully-taken-over-by-hard-right-live-news?page=with:block-5d3995e78f08d0b6ca537886#block-5d3995e78f08d0b6ca537886\">12.45pm)</a> who both asked questions that contrasted Johnson\u2019s \u201cfantasy\u201d with reality.

He was responding to a question from the Labour MP <strong>Rupa Huq, </strong>who said that when Johnson was mayor of London he proposed an amnesty for illegal immigrants. (It is <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnson-wants-amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants-post-brexit/\">an idea that Johnson has long advocated,</a> and one that he did raise during the Tory leadership contest, <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7218033/Boris-Johnson-promises-change-law-sex-attackers-increase-stop-search.html\">but only tentatively.</a>) Huq said, now Johnson was in a position to do something about this, he could show whether or not he was a man of his word.</p> \n  <p>Johnson insisted he was still committed to the idea. He told her:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is absolutely true that I have raised it several times [when] I was in government. I must say, it did not receive an overwhelming endorsement from the previous prime minister when I raised it in cabinet.</p> \n   <p>But I have to say I do think our arrangements \u2013 theoretically being committed to the expulsion of perhaps half a million people who don\u2019t have the correct papers and who may have been living and working here for many, many years without being involved in any criminal activity at all \u2013 I think that legal position is anomalous.</p> \n   <p>And we saw the difficulties that that kind of problem occasioned in the Windrush fiasco. We know the difficulties that can be caused.</p> \n   <p>And I do think \u2013 yes, I will answer [Huq] directly \u2013 I do think we need to look at our arrangements for people who have lived and worked here for a long time, unable to enter the economy, unable to participate properly or pay taxes without documents. </p> \n   <p>We should look at it. And the truth is the law already basically allows them an effective amnesty. That\u2019s basically where things have settled down. But we should look at the the economic advantages and disadvantages of going ahead with the policy that [Huq] described and which I think she and I share.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T13:38:48.602Z\">at 2.38pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d39a9e38f0845f89e3142d5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T13:13:44.096Z\">2.13pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Theresa May was not in the chamber for Boris Johnson\u2019s statement.

This is <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2018-12-03/debates/67B4BC40-0578-417D-9467-F737BDD5079C/WithdrawalAgreementLegalPosition#contribution-A3121A66-7152-457E-BD71-E0E53FDF0CB8\">what Cox said on this subject in December</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The view of the government, and my view, is that we would have obligations to pay a certain amount of money were we to leave the European Union without a deal. The House of Lords European Union committee concluded that there would be no obligation under EU law. That is a stronger argument \u2013 not necessarily an incontestable one \u2013 as to our obligations under EU law, but the committee also concluded that we might have obligations under public international law, and with that I agree. There is an argument that we would not have an obligation under public international law, but it is an argument unlikely to be accepted by any international tribunal.</p> \n   <p>My view is therefore that we would owe a presently unquantifiable sum were we to leave the European Union without a deal. It is impossible at this stage to say how much. It is true that the European Union is not a member state and is not a state, and therefore it is unable to take the case to the international court of justice. It might therefore be difficult to enforce the public international law obligation that existed. However, I ask the house to reflect on the fact that if this country, acknowledging that such obligations probably exist or do exist, did not pay them, it would be likely to cause the deepest resentment, just as it would to any of us who were unpaid a debt. If we leave a club, we pay the bar bill. If we do not pay the bill, we are not likely to get a lot of consideration from the other side.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Cox is still attorney general. It would be interesting to know if he sticks by what he said at the end of last year.</p> \n  <p>Boris Johnson is about to give his Commons statement. Hopefully he will get asked about this.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T10:45:17.891Z\">at 11.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d39828f8f08cf92bb776aee\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T10:21:35.824Z\">11.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e6f77b2f73a6f5fdf5b7fbf0a8486c7e8946050\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e6f77b2f73a6f5fdf5b7fbf0a8486c7e8946050/0_33_950_570/500.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson leaving Number 10 this morning ahead of his statement to the Commons.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson leaving No 10 this morning ahead of his statement to the Commons.<br></span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isabel Infantes/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T10:23:38.692Z\">at 11.23am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d397f838f08d0b6ca53772a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T10:09:28.797Z\">11.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/07/paul-dacre-i-made-boris-johnson-cry/\">a diary item for this week\u2019s Spectator,</a> <strong>Paul Dacre</strong>, the former Daily Mail editor, claims he once reduced Boris Johnson to tears.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is very clarifying because what it establishes beyond all doubt is that the Conservative party has now been fully taken over, top to bottom, by the hard right, that they\u2019re basically turning themselves into the Brexit party in order to hold off Nigel Farage.</p> \n   <p>And those few elements remaining of the one-nation, liberal conservative, Cameron-style Conservatives - they are neutered captives in this cabinet.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s events: The new prime minister, Boris Johnson, addressed the Commons for the first time since assuming the role. You can read a comprehensive summary of that here. My colleague, Jessica Elgot, has also produced this rather good summary of the policy announcements Johnson made. Earlier in the day, Johnson said the government was committed to leaving EU by 31 October \u2018no ifs, no buts\u2019. He told his new cabinet: \u201cAs you all know we have a momentous task ahead of us, at a pivotal moment in our country\u2019s history.\u201d You can see the full cabinet list here. The prominent hard Brexit-backer, Steve Baker, declined a role in Johnson\u2019s government. He said he did not want to repeat his \u201cexperience of powerlessness as a junior DExEU minister\u201d. The government announced a host of other junior ministerial appointments; primarily to Johnson loyalists. Confirmed in various posts were Jesse Norman, Nigel Adams and Lucy Frazer, as well as Kit Malthouse, Conor Burns and Nick Gibb and George Eustice and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey. Also confirmed were Chris Pincher and Mark Lancaster, as well as Andrew Stephenson, Andrew Murrison and Justin Tomlinson \u2013 and, finally, Chris Skidmore, Caroline Dinenage and Chris Heaton-Harris. Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet has twice as many privately educated ministers as Theresa May\u2019s, a social mobility charity claimed. The Sutton Trust said 64% of Johnson\u2019s cabinet was privately educated, 27% went to a comprehensive, while 9% attended a grammar school. And, if you\u2019d like to read about the early discussions between Number 10 and the EU, my colleagues Heather Stewart, Lisa O\u2019Carroll and Daniel Boffey have the full story: Downing Street has just announced what\u2019s understood to be the final set of junior ministerial appointments for this evening. Chris Skidmore moves from his job as universities minister to serve as a junior minister in the Department of Health and Social Care. He will work alongside Caroline Dinenage, who remains in her post there. And Chris Heaton-Harris is appointed a junior transport minister. Each was a consistent backer of May\u2019s deal in the Commons. Three more junior ministerial appointments now confirmed by Downing Street. Andrew Stephenson will serve in the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development, where he will join Andrew Murrison, who remains with both. And Justin Tomlinson stays in his job at the DWP. Tomlinson and Murrison voted for May\u2019s deal each of the three times it came before the Commons. Stephenson backed it the first time and was a teller for the second and third divisions. Steve Baker is giving little away here: There has been speculation in Westminster that Baker was upset that he wasn\u2019t offered a more senior role \u2013 perhaps including a seat at the cabinet table. Baker has himself indicated he felt the position he was offered would leave him powerless. The new home secretary, Priti Patel, holds a \u00a31,000-an hour contract with a global communications firm that supplies products and services to the UK government, the Guardian can reveal. Patel, who was appointed on Wednesday by the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a part of a wholesale gutting of the cabinet, has been working for Viasat for the past three months as a strategic adviser earning \u00a35,000 for five hours\u2019 work a month. She recorded the role on the MPs\u2019 register of interests, and the contract is due to expire on 31 July. Viasat, a Californian company with a UK base in Farnborough, supplies services and products to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The MoD works in collaboration with the Home Office on numerous projects, including the Innovation and Research Insights (IRIS) Unit, which sets up technology-based contracts for both departments. Patel, who was forced to resign from government two years ago for failing to disclose secret meetings with Israeli ministers, is understood to have been advising Viasat on a matter relating to India. Downing Street has announced that Chris Pincher has been appointed as a junior Foreign Office minister. Pincher stood down from a role in the whips office in November 2017, at the height of the Westminster sexual harassment scandal. He was subsequently cleared over allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour by an independent panel and went on to serve as deputy chief whip. Mark Lancaster remains a junior MoD minister, No 10 has added. Both men consistently voted for May\u2019s deal. The former junior Brexit minister and deputy chair of the hard Brexit-supporting ERG, Steve Baker, says he\u2019s declined a ministerial position this evening: And two more junior ministerial appointments now confirmed by No 10: George Eustice and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Coffey, both consistent supporters of May\u2019s deal, go to Defra. Eustice served as agriculture minister until February, when he resigned, saying May\u2019s decision to allow a vote on delaying article 50 would be \u201cthe final humiliation of our country\u201d. At the time, Johnson praised him, saying: Downing Street has now officially announced the following appointments: Kit Malthouse as a Home Office minister Conor Burns as a junior minister at the Department for International Trade Nick Gibb remains a junior education minister Burns, like the new prime minister, voted against May\u2019s deal the first two times it came before the Commons, before supporting it the third time. Malthouse and Gibb both voted for it on each occasion. There seems to be some intrigue in the case of the hard Brexit-supporting Steve Baker, however. He was thought to be on the cusp of an important government job, having headed into No 10. He even seemed to be indulging in some jocular back-and-forth with journalists while inside. Now, it seems there may have been a snag: In its account of the discussions between Johnson told Juncker, Downing Street has stressed the prime minister made clear that he required the \u201cabolition of the backstop\u201d. The prime minister today received a call of congratulation from European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. The PM thanked the president for his message. On Brexit, the PM reiterated that he wants a deal, and will be energetic in pursuit of finding a way forward, but said the withdrawal agreement has been rejected three times by the UK Parliament and will not pass in its current form. The PM said that, if an agreement is to be reached, it must be understood that the way to a deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. The PM and the president agreed to stay in contact. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has not said when he will make a move in the Commons to potentially trigger a general election. Outside Parliament this evening, however, he\u2019s attending a rally to demand one. He\u2019s expected to say: Never mind the bluster and arm-waving, [Boris Johnson] has got no plan for this country. No plan on Brexit, no plan to rebuild our public services, and no plan to tackle the climate emergency. He spent his leadership campaign promising tax giveaways to the richest and the big corporations. And he\u2019s threatening a no-deal Brexit, staking all of our futures on a sweetheart trade deal with Donald Trump that would risk the takeover of our NHS by US corporations. He\u2019s expected to highlight Johnson\u2019s appointment of what Labour see as a hard-right cabinet: This prime minister wasn\u2019t chosen by the people, he was chosen by fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Tory party members. You deserve your say. Whether that\u2019s in a public vote on Brexit or in a general election, so everyone has the chance to decide the future of our country. The choice will be between Johnson\u2019s divisive government for the wealthy few \u2013 and a radical Labour government that will bring the country together and deliver for the many. Downing Street has now confirmed that Jesse Norman will remain as financial secretary to the Treasury, Nigel Adams will become the minister of state at the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and Lucy Frazer will become a minister of state at the Ministry of Justice. Adams quit May\u2019s government in April over her decision to hold talks on Brexit with Jeremy Corbyn. All three voted for May\u2019s withdrawal agreement on each of the occasions it came before the Commons. We told you earlier that the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, had told Johnson the EU would not give in to his demand to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. My colleague, Jennifer Rankin, has a succinct assessment of the discussions between Johnson and Juncker There are multiple unconfirmed reports from Westminster correspondents of more ministerial movement, as Boris Johnson continues to build his government this evening Yet more MPs have been seen heading into No 10, including the hardline Brexiter, Steve Baker: Boris Johnson is still reshuffling his government. These are from Stephen Hammond, one of the most pro-European Conservatives, who has quit as a health minister. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Kevin Rawlinson is now taking over. This is from Reuters. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker has told Britain\u2019s new prime minister, Boris Johnson, that the bloc\u2019s member nations will not give in to his demand to renegotiate the Brexit withdrawal treaty. Juncker called the existing deal \u201cthe best and only agreement possible.\u201d Juncker and Johnson had their first phone conversation late Thursday since Johnson took over from Theresa May as Britain\u2019s leader. Johnson has insisted that the current agreement to leave the EU and arrangements regarding the Irish border were not good enough and had to be renegotiated. An EU official with knowledge of the exchange said that despite Juncker\u2019s refusal to reopen the legal 585-page legal agreement, Juncker said he \u201cremains at the disposal of the United Kingdom to add language\u201d to a political text on future relations and \u201cto analyze any ideas put forward by the United Kingdom, providing they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement.\u201d And here is my colleague Owen Jones on Boris Johnson. The Boris Johnson statement to the Commons, and the two and a half hours he spent responding to questions from MPs, threw up quite a lot of interesting material. You can read his opening statement here. My colleague Jessica Elgot has written a summary and analysis of the policy pledges he made in it here. And I have written about some of the other newsy comments Johnson made later in the session on the blog, including his support for an amnesty for up to 500,000 undocumented migrants (see 2.34pm) and his call for all government cleaners to get the London living wage (see 4.09pm). There was also a lot of political knockabout in the session. Normally this does not get a lot of attention, but it is worth flagging up today because it felt as if we were getting a sneak preview of the Tory autumn election campaign. It also felt as if we were getting a strong hint that there will be an autumn election campaign. When Johnson was talking about policy, he sounded unengaged, but when he was rehearsing attack lines for use against Labour and the SNP, he sounded \u2013 to use his own word \u2013 \u201cenergised\u201d. And in the context of the Commons chamber, he was effective. Five key campaign themes emerged. Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign themes 1) Johnson is explicitly running on a Trump-style \u2018make Britain great again\u2019 platform. He did not use that slogan, but that nevertheless was the message. Election campaigners often argue that appeals to emotion are more powerful than appeals to reason. And hope is seen as easier to sell than fear (although there are lots of elections where fear wins). Johnson has absorbed these ideas. This is how he started his statement. Our mission is to deliver Brexit on 31 October for the purpose of uniting and re-energising our great United Kingdom and making this country the greatest place on earth. When I say \u201cthe greatest place on earth\u201d, I am conscious that some may accuse me of hyperbole, but it is useful to imagine the trajectory on which we could now be embarked. By 2050, it is more than possible that the United Kingdom will be the greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe, at the centre of a new network of trade deals, which we have pioneered. 2) He is happy to attack Labour as a remain party. In his response to Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn called for a referendum on Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans and said Labour would campaign for remain. In his reply, Johnson seized on this, claiming Corbyn had made a strategic error. He speaks about trust in our democracy. I have to say that a most extraordinary thing has just happened today. Did anybody notice? Did anybody notice the terrible metamorphosis that took place, like the final scene of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers? At last, this longstanding Eurosceptic, the right honourable gentleman, has been captured. He has been jugulated, he has been reprogrammed by his honourable friends. He has been turned now into a remainer! Of all the flip-flops that he has performed in his tergiversating career, that is the one for which I think he will pay the highest price. It is this party now, this government, who are clearly on the side of democracy in this country. Theresa May also used to attack Labour for supporting a second referendum. But Johnson did it today with more gusto, and he sought to frame it as an argument not about the EU, but about democracy. It also sounded like an argument you would deploy in an election before the UK had left the EU \u2013 another reason why journalists came away sensing an autumn election was likely. 3) Johnson sought to steal Labour\u2019s main party slogan. Corbyn says Labour is the party for the many, not the few. Today Johnson sought to appropriate this. In his response to Corbyn he also said: The reality now is that we are the party of the people. We are the party of the many, and they are the party of the few. We will take this country forwards; they, Mr Speaker, would take it backwards. 4) Johnson is going to campaign on an old-fashioned, law-and-order platform. The independent MP Chris Leslie tried to embarrass him by asking him about Priti Patel, the new home secretary\u2019s previous support for the death penalty. Johnson said he did not support it himself, but then he went on the offensive over crime. He told Leslie: I do not support the death penalty, but what the people of this country want to see is proper sentencing for serious violent and sexual offenders. He claimed some Labour MPs were nodding, and went on: There are members opposite who know where their constituents truly are on some of these issues, and they are right, unlike the current leadership of the Labour party. 5) Johnson is challenging Labour to a spending war. This came when the Labour MP Meg Hillier challenged Johnson to explain how his spending promises were affordable. In reply he claimed his proposals were modest and easily affordable. He then challenged Labour to say if they were not prepared to match his spending plans. He said: If Labour members are now opposing that spending \u2013 if they now think that we should not be putting another \u00a31bn into policing and another \u00a34.6bn into education\u2014then now is the time to speak. Labour\u2019s response Much of what Johnson said today was implausible, evasive or just downright wrong \u2013 like his reply to Meg Hillier quoted above. (The Institute for Fiscal Studies says his plans are anything but modest.) Many Labour MPs made these points, including Jeremy Corbyn, whose opening statement highlighted numerous flaws in Johnson\u2019s case. Corbyn ended up making a sound plea for competence over bluster. The challenge to end austerity, tackle inequality, resolve Brexit and tackle the climate emergency will define the new prime minister. Instead, we have a hard-right cabinet staking everything on tax cuts for the few and a reckless race-to-the-bottom Brexit. He says he has \u201cpluck and nerve and ambition\u201d; our country does not need arm-waving bluster; we need competence, seriousness and, after a decade of divisive policies for the few, to focus for once on the interests of the many. But does this message work? It is hard to know without proper polling, but the election of Trump in America showed that reason and truth does not always win over against emotive falsehoods. It felt as if the two Labour MPs who did the most to puncture the Johnson hubris bubble were Liz Kendall (see 12.32pm) and Hillier (see 12.45pm) who both asked questions that contrasted Johnson\u2019s \u201cfantasy\u201d with reality. But, overall, no one came close to discomforting Johnson. Labour and the other opposition parties will need to think harder about how to upend him. Verdict from Twitter commentariat Other commentators feel the same way. Here are some of their tweets. From LabourList\u2019s Sienna Rodgers From Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall From the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves From BuzzFeed\u2019s Alberto Nardelli From the Evening Standard\u2019s Kate Proctor From the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley From the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth Alister Jack, the new Scottish secretary, has implied he may not back a no deal Brexit if the government has failed to properly prepare for it, despite positioning himself as a supporter of Boris Johnson\u2019s readiness for a no deal divorce In an interview to be broadcast by the BBC, Jack was asked whether he backed exiting without an agreement. His answer strongly suggested his support for Johnson\u2019s no deal agenda is not unconditional. I will take stock of the situation and if we have to leave without a deal, if I feel we have prepared for that, then we will leave without a deal. That will be a cabinet decision and that is what we have all signed up to and the preparations start in earnest \u2026 We need to make sure we are absolutely ready. He said it was essential that Johnson spent the \u00a34.2bn made available for no deal contingency preparations. Jack was appointed Scottish secretary after Johnson sacked the veteran and originally pro-remain Tory MP David Mundell on Tuesday. Jack and Mundell hold neighbouring constituencies in southern Scotland, but Jack only became an MP in 2017; Mundell has sat in the Scottish and then Westminster parliaments for 20 years. Jack told the BBC he believed a no deal Brexit could prove liberating for the British economy but stressed again he believed there had to be proper preparation for that: I don\u2019t think a no deal Brexit will be seriously damaging if we prepare for it properly. I do think there will be bumps along the way. I\u2019m quite realistic about that \u2026 One thing I would like to see is a strong deal with our European partners \u2013 so that\u2019s quite clear: a free trade agreement. A leave supporter, Jack voted three times for May\u2019s deal but has latterly hovered on the fringes of the hard Brexiteers, signing the rebel letter written by 62 MPs in February 2018 urging Theresa May to guarantee the UK would not be tied to the customs union or single market post Brexit. However, he is also seen as a classic shire Tory: a farmer and self-made millionaire educated at Glenalmond boarding school, he is a member of the Queen\u2019s Royal Company of Archers, who act as a ceremonial honour guard in Scotland, and was previously chair of the River Annan Trust and District Salmon Fishery Board. Dominic Raab has been addressing Foreign Office staff in his new capacity as foreign secretary. This is what Boris Johnson said to the Labour MP Catherine West when she asked for an assurance that every single entry-level cleaner in Whitehall would be paid the London living wage. Johnson replied: I have to say \u2013 the answer is yes. I was very proud that I when I was running London that we massively expanded with the living wage. And we made sure that it was paid not just by by GLA bodies, but by their contractors as well. And that is what we should be doing. When asked of evidence for his commitment to social justice, Johnson tends to refer to his record as London mayor, and particularly the expansion of the London living wage, The Greater London authority was one of the bodies that paid it to all its staff. The London living wage is currently set at \u00a310.55 per hour. It is a voluntary target which is intended to set what would be an acceptable minimum for workers in the capital. It is not the same as the national living wage, the statutory minimum wage for workers over 25, which is \u00a38.21 per hour. Here is my colleague Daniel Boffey on Michel Barnier\u2019s note to the EU27. (See 3.15pm.) The new government has abandoned the target of getting annual net migration below 100,000. This was set as a goal by David Cameron, and maintained by Theresa May, but their governments never came close to meeting it. After Boris Johnson\u2019s statement to MPs, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman, when asked about the 100,000, target, said Johnson was not interested in a \u201cnumbers game\u201d. The spokesman said: His view is that we need to introduce an Australian points-based system that allows us to take back control of our borders He is determined to deliver it, which is why he has commissioned Mac (the Migration Advisory Committee) to carry out the work to get that system. He said in the campaign he wasn\u2019t interested in a numbers game. Here is my colleague Jessica Elgot\u2019s summary of what Boris Johnson was promising in his statement to MPs in the Commons. The Financial Times\u2019 Alex Barker says Michel Barnier, the EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, has written to EU member states saying that Boris Johnson\u2019s call for the backstop to be removed is \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach (prime minister), has restated his government\u2019s support for the backstop. He said: The position of the European Union and the position of Ireland has not changed. The backstop is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement; without the backstop there is no withdrawal agreement, there is no transition phase, there is no implementation phase and there will be no free trade agreement until all those matters are resolved. So I hope that the new UK prime minister has not chosen no deal, but that will be up to them. Campaigners for EU nationals have expressed disappointment that Boris Johnson did not commit to new legislation to seal their rights to remain in the UK post Brexit. They were hoping he would use his first appearance at the dispatch box to put flesh on the bones of his campaign pledge to ensure all their rights were guaranteed after Brexit. They are looking for a \u201cdeclaratory\u201d system, which would require EU citizens to simply register as living in the UK, rather than apply for the right to stay as they do under the current settled status scheme. Nicolas Hatton, co-founder of the3million, said: Another damp squib on citizens\u2019 rights by another prime minister. No commitment to fully protect our rights for our lifetime but vague guarantee as if it was 2016. Meanwhile, EU citizens in the UK and Brits in Europe are still the bargaining chips of the Brexit negotiations. British in Europe are astonished that for a second day running Johnson did not refer to the 1.2 million who are living on the continent. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, and her Welsh opposite number, Mark Drakeford, have written jointly to Boris Johnson urging him to abandon plans for a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d no-deal Brexit. Calling for urgent inter-governmental talks, the duo also urged Johnson to give both devolved governments an equal say in the planning for Brexit, alongside guarantees that neither government would be financially worse off as a result of leaving the EU and that both would get a fair share of any post-Brexit emergency funding. Johnson is thought to be planning a tour of the UK within the next week, with some speculation he will travel to the north-east of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which will bring these questions to the fore. Sturgeon and Drakeford also called on Johnson to prepare the UK for a second EU referendum, pointing out that both the Welsh and Scottish governments officially backed a second vote on Brexit. They said they were still making preparations for a no-deal Brexit, but added that that option would be disastrous. They said: It would be unconscionable for a UK government to contemplate a chaotic no-deal exit, and we urge you to reject this possibility clearly and unambiguously as soon as possible. We are also clear that the decision on EU exit must now be put back to the people. It is the policy of both governments that the UK parliament should legislate for a further referendum. If such a referendum is held we will argue strongly that the UK should remain in the EU. In a lengthy shopping list of demands, they asked for a seat in any trade talks post-Brexit with the EU and other countries which honoured recent promises by David Lidington, Michael Gove\u2019s predecessor as Cabinet Office minister, to increase their involvement. They also asked for Theresa May\u2019s immigration white paper to be replaced by new measures to guarantee migration policy did not damage the Scottish and Welsh economies. The Tories have already said May\u2019s proposals, including a \u00a330,000 minimum salary for new entrants, would be scrapped. However, Priti Patel, the new home secretary, is an immigration hardliner who supported May\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d strategy. The Irish government has expressed \u201calarm\u201d at the new approach of the Boris Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit and Ireland. Asked what he thought about the new cabinet, Michael Creed, agriculture minister, said \u201cthe makeup of this government seems to be a mirror image of his own viewpoint substantially and obviously that would be of concern to us\u201d. Speaking as the Irish cabinet met in Donegal, Creed added: What the government is concerned about now is the approach of new administration in UK to the withdrawal agreement. We see that as the way to have a planned withdrawal arrangement and obviously what we are hearing from the government is quite alarming. But we consider all of those matters when we have greater clarity about the intention of the government in the UK. This is what Boris Johnson said during his statement about considering an amnesty for migrants in the UK illegally. He was responding to a question from the Labour MP Rupa Huq, who said that when Johnson was mayor of London he proposed an amnesty for illegal immigrants. (It is an idea that Johnson has long advocated, and one that he did raise during the Tory leadership contest, but only tentatively.) Huq said, now Johnson was in a position to do something about this, he could show whether or not he was a man of his word. Johnson insisted he was still committed to the idea. He told her: It is absolutely true that I have raised it several times [when] I was in government. I must say, it did not receive an overwhelming endorsement from the previous prime minister when I raised it in cabinet. But I have to say I do think our arrangements \u2013 theoretically being committed to the expulsion of perhaps half a million people who don\u2019t have the correct papers and who may have been living and working here for many, many years without being involved in any criminal activity at all \u2013 I think that legal position is anomalous. And we saw the difficulties that that kind of problem occasioned in the Windrush fiasco. We know the difficulties that can be caused. And I do think \u2013 yes, I will answer [Huq] directly \u2013 I do think we need to look at our arrangements for people who have lived and worked here for a long time, unable to enter the economy, unable to participate properly or pay taxes without documents. We should look at it. And the truth is the law already basically allows them an effective amnesty. That\u2019s basically where things have settled down. But we should look at the the economic advantages and disadvantages of going ahead with the policy that [Huq] described and which I think she and I share. Theresa May was not in the chamber for Boris Johnson\u2019s statement. Along with Greg Clark, the former business secretary, and David Gauke, the former justice secretary, she has been at Lords watching the England v Ireland test match. All three left the cabinet yesterday. Gauke and Clark are seen as leading members of the \u201cGaukward squad\u201d, former ministers set to oppose any attempt to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, and that fact that they\u2019re with May will fuel suspicions that she is an honorary member too. Johnson has now finished. He was on his feet for two and a half hours. John Bercow, the Speaker, said he took 129 questions. I will post a summary and reaction soon. The SNP\u2019s Stephen Gethins asks Johnson to accept that he was wrong to say kipper packaging rules are made by the EU. Johnson says it is extraordinary that the SNP has decided to respond to the issue of fish, given that their policy would keep Scotland in the common fisheries policy. Johnson refuses to acknowledge that he falsely blamed the EU for deciding new rules on kipper packaging. The SNP\u2019s Peter Grant says the assurances in the settled status scheme do not offer EU nationals the same rights they have now. Will Johnson ensure people keep the rights they have now? Johnson says the government is giving those assurances. It wants to see them reciprocated by other EU nations. Gavin Shuker, the independent MP, asks if Johnson will hold a confidence vote in September. Johnson says the right thing to do is to go ahead and deliver Brexit. The SNP\u2019s Tommy Sheppard asks if Johnson will respect a decision by the Scottish parliament to decide to consult people on independence. Johnson says the decision was taken in 2014. That was the right one. Johnson refuses to commit to allowing the Scottish parliament to hold another referendum on independence. The DUP\u2019s Ian Paisley asks if Johnson will intervene to help the coachbuilder Wrightbus. Johnson says the current mayor of London abandoned a contract with the firm. The government will do what it can to help, he says. The SNP\u2019s Patrick Grady asks if Johnson supports the principle in the Claim of Right for Scotland. Johnson says the people of Scotland had a vote on independence, and took a decision. Labour\u2019s Jack Dromey asks if Johnson will meet a delegation from manufacturing industry to hear their concerns about a no-deal Brexit. Johnson says Michael Gove, who is in charge of no-deal planning, would be happy to meet them. According to Sky\u2019s Sam Coates, Alberto Costa, the Conservative MP who has been campaigning for EU nationals living in the UK to have their rights guaranteed, does not think the assurance from Boris Johnson today goes far enough. Labour\u2019s Diana Johnson asks Johnson what his priority is: Crossrail for the north, between Hull and Liverpool, or Crossrail 2 in London. Johnson says he cannot choose between them. That is like asking a tigress to choose between her cubs, he says. Asked about immigration, Johnson says in effect there is already an amnesty for migrants who have been in the country illegally for many years. He says the government should consider the case for formalising this. Johnson floats idea of amnesty for illegal immigrants. This is an idea that Johnson has floated before. Giles Watling, a Conservative, asks if Johnson can improve the rail service to places like Clacton, his constiuency. Johnson says he wants to use infrastructure to level up the country. Johnson repeats his point about how the SNP would have to campaign to hand back control of fishing to the EU after Brexit if it continued to campaign for EU membership. He says he expects the party to perform a U-turn on that at some point. Catherine West, the Labour MP, says Johnson believes in the London living wage. But many government departments do not pay it. Will Johnson commit to ensuring that they do pay it. Johnson says all government departments should pay their cleaners the London living wage. UPDATE: See 4.06pm for the full quote. Chris Leslie, of the Independent Group for Change, asks if Johnson agrees with Priti Patel on the death penalty. Johnson says he does not support the death penalty. But he says he does want to see serious offenders serve their sentences properly. He says Labour MPs should realise that this is what their constituents want. UPDATE: Originally this post said Johnson said he abhorred the penalty. I\u2019m sorry; I misheard. He just said he did not support the death penalty. I\u2019ve corrected that now. Labour\u2019s Anneliese Dodds asks why Johnson said so little about the climate emergency if he really cares about it. Johnson says the Conservatives are the only party that believes private sector-driven new technology can provide a solution to the problem. Labour\u2019s Clive Efford says the leave campaign wanted to restore parliamentary sovereignty. So why has Johnson hired an adviser, Dominic Cummings, found in contempt of parliament. Johnson ignores the question and says it is a disgrace Labour wants to reverse the referendum result. Asked what changes he wants to the withdrawal agreement, Johnson says the first step should be to get rid of the backstop. Alec Shelbrooke, a Conservative, asks if Johnson will back his plan to ban unpaid internships. Johnson says Shelbrooke is \u201centirely right\u201d. People should get jobs on merit. Mark Menzies, a Conservative, asks if Johnson will commit to more spending on small transport projects. Johnson jokes that he has lost count of how many road schemes he has committed to backing. Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock says the Tory manifesto said there would be a deal. So does Johnson accept he has no mandate for no deal. Johnson says the party also said no deal would be better than a bad deal. Labour\u2019s Peter Kyle asks what legal changes Johnson wants to introduce to enhance workers\u2019 rights that would not be allowed if the UK remained in the EU? Johnson says that is for the Commons to decide. Peter Bone, the Tory Brexiter, says for the first time in months he has slept soundly. Will Johnson ensure that continues? Johnson says he is going to take the country out of the EU by 31 October. Labour\u2019s Chi Onwurah asks Johnson to give the three things he admires most about the north-east. Johnson says the people of the north-east should answer that. It would be patronising for him to answer. But he does know that the north-east is the only region of the county that is a net exporter, he says. Henry Smith, a Conservative, asks when MPs will know how many extra police officers each force area will get. As soon as possible, Johnson says. Labour\u2019s Emma Lewell-Buck says it is important for the PM do be on top of the detail. So can he say now what is in paragraph 5(C) of Gatt article 24? That is a reference to one of the questions Andrew Neil asked Johnson in his BBC interview recently. Johnson declines to answer, but he says he plans to rely on paragraph 5(B). Colin Clark, a Tory, asks Johnson if he will support the oil industry in Scotland. Johnson says this industry has a great future. Asked about the Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, saying she would still oppose Brexit, even if people voted for it in a second referendum, Johnson says the opposition are like dictators; they want to ignore the will of the people. Labour\u2019s Debbie Abrahams says she loves this country and its people. But all the evidence shows the richer are getting richer and the poorer are getting poorer. Johnson says that is not correct. Income inequality has declined since 2010, he says. He says the government has lifted poor people out of tax. (Actually, recent figures show income inequality is increasing.) Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant asks Johnson to get rid of the five-week waiting time for payments under universal credit. Johnson says people can get advances on their benefit payments. Labour wants to scrap universal credit, he says. He defends the system. Labour\u2019s Alison McGovern says we now have a Vote Leave government. Does Johnson stand by the promises he made to have no change at the Irish border, and no sudden changes in the economy? Yes, says Johnson. He says he is opposed to border controls. And as for the economy, he implies that if there were a no-deal Brexit, it would be the fault of the EU. Ed Davey, the Lib Dem MP, asks if Johnson agrees the UK faces a climate emergency. Johnson says the government is leading the world in setting a net zero emissions target for 2050. Carbon emissions have been cut dramatically, he says. When he was London mayor carbon emissions were cut by 14% by new technology. That is the policy he will adopt. Johnson refuses to say the UK faces a climate emergency. The SNP\u2019s Stewart McDonald asks Johnson why he has refused to answer questions about his relationship with the former Russian arms dealer Alexander Temerko. Johnson says if McDonald has an allegation to make, he should put it to him in writing. Justine Greening, a Conservative, asks Johnson if he agrees any deal must be put to the people in a referendum. Johnson says he does not agree. Labour is now a referendum party, he says. But a referendum should only happen once a generation. (In the past Johnson did once express some support for the idea of holding a second referendum.) Labour\u2019s Laura Smith asks if Johnson will apologise for what he said about how investigating historical child abuse was spaffing money against the wall. Johnson says this country can be proud of its record on tackling child abuse. Labour\u2019s Angela Eagle says one of the principles of public life is honesty. Has Johnson always been honest in his political career? Johnson says he has always delivered what he has promised. In fact, he has promised X and delivered X plus 20. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the public accounts committee, says there is a difference between optimism and fantasy. If Johnson wants to convince people he is not a fantasist, he will need to explain how he will fund his spending plans. Johnson says his spending plans are relatively modest. He challenges Labour to commit to matching what he has promised. Asked if he will guarantee workers\u2019 rights after Brexit, Johnson says he hopes to enhance workers\u2019 rights after Brexit. Labour has listed 10 questions that it says Boris Johnson did not answer when he was responding to Jeremy Corbyn. Caroline Lucas, the Green MP, asks if Johnson will honour his promise to lie in front of bulldozers to stop the Heathrow extension. Johnson says he is watching the court cases taking place with lively interest. Anna Soubry, the Independent Group for Change leader, asks Johnson to bring the matter back to the Commons if he fails to get a new Brexit deal. Johnson says MPs have already voted for Brexit. Johnson refuses to commit to giving MPs a vote on what happens next if he fails to negotiate a new Brexit deal. Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden asks if Johnson accepts the commitment on the backstop made in the joint agreement between the UK and the EU in the joint report of December 2017. Johnson says that is the trap from which the UK is trying to escape. Johnson suggests UK no longer feels bound by December 2017 joint report with EU on Brexit. Julian Lewis, the Tory chair of the defence committee, asks Johnson if he agrees defence spending needs to go up. Johnson says he has a strong desire to increase spending, particularly on ship building. Labour\u2019s Liz Kendall says, if optimism was all it took, today people would be wandering across the garden bridge (the Johnson project that failed) and taking off on holiday from the Boris island airport (another Johnson scheme that never got off the drawing board). He asks Johnson what he will do about social care. Johnson says he wants a cross-party solution to this. Sir Oliver Letwin, a Tory, says he does not agree with Johnson on Brexit, but he says he thinks there is a possible majority in the Commons for a deal. Johnson welcomes what he says. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Liz Saville Roberts asks what is Johnson\u2019s priority: delivering Brexit, or maintaining the union? He will have to pick one, do or die, she says. Johnson says the people of the UK voted to leave the EU, and the people of Wales voted emphatically to do so. John Baron, a Tory Brexiter, congratulates Johnson on his \u201ccracking\u201d policies so far. He says it says a lot that the four great offices of state are held by the descendants of immigrants. He asks if Johnson will maintain a cancer treatment initiative. Johnson says he will carry on with that scheme. Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn says Leo Varadkar, the Irish PM, said yesterday trying to negotiate a new deal by October was \u201cnot in the real world\u201d. What will Johnson do if MPs vote against no deal? Johnson says Benn\u2019s question is redolent of the defeatism he deplores. Why does not Benn think the EU might think again? All parties know what will happen if they do not honour the referendum result. UPDATE: Here are the quotes. Labour\u2019s Yvette Cooper asks if Johnson can say what the technology will be for alternatives to the backstop in Ireland. She asked the chancellor 17 times, but he could not say, she says. Johnson says abundant options are available, including trusted trader schemes. Owen Paterson, the Brexiter former environment secretary, asks for an assurance that the UK will take back \u201ctotal sovereignty\u201d over fishing after Brexit. Johnson says that is exactly what he will do. Here is the Press Association\u2019s first take on Boris Johnson\u2019s statement. Boris Johnson has urged Brussels to rethink its opposition to negotiating a new agreement on the terms of Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU. In his first statement to MPs as prime minister, Johnson reaffirmed his determination to deliver Brexit by the October 31 deadline, warning of a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d loss of confidence in the UK\u2019s democracy if they failed. Johnson, who entered the Commons chamber to cheers from Tory MPs, insisted that he wanted to take Britain out of the EU with a deal. But he said Theresa May\u2019s deal had been rejected three times by the House and could not be brought back again. \u201cI would prefer us to leave the EU with a deal - I would much prefer it,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that it is possible even at this late stage and I will work flat out to make it happen. \u201cBut certain things need to be clear. The withdrawal agreement negotiated by my predecessor has been three times rejected by this House. \u201cIts terms are unacceptable to this parliament and this country,\u201d he said. He said that his new government was ready to negotiate with Brussels in good faith. \u201cWe will throw ourselves into these negotiations with the greatest energy and determination and in a spirit of friendship,\u201d he said. But at the same time he promise to \u201cturbocharge\u201d preparations for a no-deal Brexit in the event that they were unable to come to an agreement with the EU. Nigel Dodds, the DUP leader at Westminster, welcomes Johnson\u2019s positivity and optimism. He says the UK must be prepared for no deal if necessary. Johnson thanks Dodds for his support, and for what he has done to protect the people of the UK from the \u201cdepredations of the party opposite\u201d. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, says the 3 million EU nationals here are our family, our friends, our carers. But they have been kept in uncertainty. So will Johnson back the bill from the Lib Dem peer Lord Oates backing their rights. Johnson says he can guarantee their rights. He says 1 million people have already signed up to the settlement scheme. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, welcomes Johnson as the last PM of the United Kingdom. It is sometimes said Johnson lives in a parallel universe. Today he appears to have gone to outer space, Blackford says. He asks Johnson to accept Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s request for a meeting. A no-deal Brexit would cost Scotland 100,000 jobs, he says. He says Johnson has admitted he has done no analysis of the outcome of his plan. He says Johnson is deluded. If Johnson tries to take the UK out of the EU without a deal, Scotland will stop him and this parliament \u201cwill stop this madness in its tracks\u201d. He says Johnson does not have a mandate to be PM. He asks Johnson to rule out changing the Barnett formula. He says Sturgeon is now reviewing the timetable for a second independence referendum. Blackford says SNP government considering bringing forward its plans for a second independence referendum. In response, Johnson says Nicola Sturgeon replaced Alex Salmond without a vote. He asks if the SNP would really campaign to rejoin the EU, and to hand back control of fisheries to the EU, after Brexit. He says he will govern for the whole of the UK. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, says the EU will have listened to what Johnson had to say. He asks the government to say every week what has been done to prepare for no deal, so that the EU knows when the UK is ready. Johnson welcomes that idea. He says there will be a very active campaign to get the public ready. Johnson is replying to Corbyn. He says he struggles to identify a question in that. But under no circumstances will he make the NHS part of any US trade deal. It is the Conservatives that have allowed the NHS to flourish, through a strong economy. He says he struggles to identify the country Corbyn describes. He says wages are outperforming inflation. And the living wage, a Conservative policy he championed in London, has expanded the incomes of those who have received it, he says. He says Corbyn asked about Iran. But he has been paid by Iranian TV. He repeatedly sides with the mullahs of Iran, Johnson claims. He says John McDonnell was sacked by Ken Livingstone for faking a budget. (You would have thought Johnson would not want to accuse people of getting sacked for making things up.) Johnson says Labour would put up taxes on gardens. He says a terrible metamorphosis happened today. Corbyn has been captured, and \u201cturned into a remainer\u201d. Of all the flip-flops Corbyn has performed in his tergiversating career, this is probably the most serious, he says. He says the reality is that the Conservatives are the party of the people. The Tories are the party of the many, Labour of the few. The Tories will take the country forward, while Labour will take it backwards. Johnson ends, with Tory MPs chanting \u201cmore\u201d. Corbyn says the challenge to end inequality, tackle Brexit and end austerity will define the new government. The country does not need \u201carm-waving bluster\u201d, but competence. Instead of focusing on the few, the new PM should address the needs of the many. Corbyn says the office of PM requires integrity and honesty. So will Johnson correct his claim that the rules on kipper packaging are not from the EU? And will Johnson admit that the \u00a339bn he talks of is actually \u00a333bn, paid over 30 years? And will he accept that the previous government said this had to be paid. So the threat to withhold it from the EU is a phoney threat. Corbyn says President Trump has labelled Johnson Britain\u2019s Trump. Will Britain\u2019s Trump rule out the NHS being part of any trade deal with the US? He says Johnson would make the UK a vassal state of America. Corbyn says the wealthy elite will not lose out from a no-deal Brexit. If Johnson has confidence in his plan, he should take it back to the people, Corbyn says. He says Labour would campaign to remain in any referendum on a Johnson Brexit deal. Jeremy Corbyn is responding now. He welcomes Boris Johnson to his job. But he says he is worried that Johnson overestimates himself. He says the government opted for austerity as a political choice. He says Johnson is promising tax breaks to business \u2013 his own party\u2019s funders. When will the government set out its spending plans for departments? Will Johnson match Labour\u2019s plan for a \u00a3500bn investment fund? Corbyn says Johnson has \u201cthrown together a hard-right cabinet\u201d. Given Priti Patel, the home secretary, supports the death penalty, can Johnson assure MPs he has no plans to bring back capital punishment? Was Johnson given sight of the Huawei leak inquiry before he made Gavin Williamson education secretary? Corbyn says Johnson voted for the backstop less than four months ago. Can he explain his flip-flopping, and why he now thinks this is unacceptable. Johnson says he wants to continue to attract the brightest talents to the UK. No one believes more than him in the benefits of immigration, he says. He says for years the public have wanted an Australian-style points system for immigration. Today he will ask the migration advisory committee to review this as an option. Johnson says he will commission report on moving to an Australian-style points-based system for immigration. (This policy always polls well with voters, most of whom are not aware that the UK already operates something similar.) He says all his life he has been told that Britain has to be a mediocre country. He does not accept this. Johnson says he is absolutely committed to delivering Brexit. There are many officials in the EU that would be better placed working on trade deals in the UK. He says the UK will not nominate a new European commissioner for after October. He says he will not wait until 31 October before rebuilding Britain. He will start on this straight away. He says NHS money will go to the frontline as soon as possible. He has asked officials to work on plans to reduce waiting times and to speed up GP appointments. He says the government will start hiring 20,000 more police officers as a priority. He says he wants to ensure serious offenders serve their sentences in full. The minimum level of per pupil funding in schools will increase, he says. And he will level up every area in the country. Johnson says the government is preparing tax cuts to stimulate innovation. It will intensify work on getting new trade deals. It will prepare an economic stimulus. And he says he can give EU nationals an assurance they will have an absolute right to remain after Brexit. (See 10.52am.) Johnson says there is too much negativity around. We must take immediate steps, he says. First, we must restore trust in democracy by taking the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He says to fail to do this would cause a \u201ccatastrophic loss of confidence\u201d in our political system. He says he would prefer to leave with a deal. But the withdrawal agreement has been rejected by MPs three times. He says the backstop is unacceptable because it undermines Britain\u2019s democracy. It must go, he says. A time limit would not be enough. He says the Irish border issue should be settled in the negotiations on the future relationship, which is where this issue should always have been decided. He says he does not accept that the backstop is needed. Other, alternative arrangements are perfectly possible. He says his team is ready to talk to the EU whenever and wherever they want to do so. He says he hopes the EU will also be ready to meet, and to rethink their current positions. He says the UK is more ready for a no-deal Brexit than many people believe. But in the days left before 31 October, the government will step up its preparations. He says, if the UK does leave without a deal, the UK will have the \u00a339bn available. (This is contested. See 11.31am.) He says the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has been put in charge of no-deal planning. And the new chancellor, Sajid Javid, has said any money necessary will be available. Boris Johnson is delivering his first statement to MPs. He starts with a tribute to Theresa May. Then he says his mission is to deliver Brexit and make the UK the greatest country on Earth. He says that might sound like hyperbole. But he claims it is realistic. (This is very Donald Trump. It sounds like a rehash of an interview that Johnson gave to the Daily Telegraph earlier this month.) Rishi Sunak, the new chief secretary to the Treasury, was on the Today programme this morning, and he claimed that if the UK were to leave the EU without a deal, the government would save up to \u00a339bn, because it would not be paying the \u201cdivorce bill\u201d set out in the withdrawal agreement. He said this because Boris Johnson made the same claim in his speech outside No 10 yesterday. Sunak said: The prime minister also said yesterday that the \u00a339bn bill that\u2019s attached to the withdrawal agreement \u2013 in the event of no deal, that\u2019s \u00a339bn that is also potentially available. But that is not the view of Geoffrey Cox, the attorney general. This is what Cox said on this subject in December: The view of the government, and my view, is that we would have obligations to pay a certain amount of money were we to leave the European Union without a deal. The House of Lords European Union committee concluded that there would be no obligation under EU law. That is a stronger argument \u2013 not necessarily an incontestable one \u2013 as to our obligations under EU law, but the committee also concluded that we might have obligations under public international law, and with that I agree. There is an argument that we would not have an obligation under public international law, but it is an argument unlikely to be accepted by any international tribunal. My view is therefore that we would owe a presently unquantifiable sum were we to leave the European Union without a deal. It is impossible at this stage to say how much. It is true that the European Union is not a member state and is not a state, and therefore it is unable to take the case to the international court of justice. It might therefore be difficult to enforce the public international law obligation that existed. However, I ask the house to reflect on the fact that if this country, acknowledging that such obligations probably exist or do exist, did not pay them, it would be likely to cause the deepest resentment, just as it would to any of us who were unpaid a debt. If we leave a club, we pay the bar bill. If we do not pay the bill, we are not likely to get a lot of consideration from the other side. Cox is still attorney general. It would be interesting to know if he sticks by what he said at the end of last year. Boris Johnson is about to give his Commons statement. Hopefully he will get asked about this. In a diary item for this week\u2019s Spectator, Paul Dacre, the former Daily Mail editor, claims he once reduced Boris Johnson to tears. He writes: I myself have had several emotional dalliances with our hero, including a lachrymose lunch (his tears not mine) with Boris bewailing that the Mail was destroying his marriage, while confiding that, anyway, monogamy is just a bourgeois convention. In fact the Mail, a family newspaper, never broke stories about his extracurricular activities, but I plead guilty to laying waste forests to intellectualise their psycho/socio-implications. The problem for us Brexiteers is there is another side to the man, with whom I have also enjoyed enthrallingly intimate dinners when he spoke with extraordinary passion, lucidity and optimism about Britain\u2019s future outside the EU. For months now, my advice to his phalanx of minders has been to padlock his zipper and to keep her [Johnson\u2019s partner, Carrie Symonds] in the background. Not that he\u2019ll take a blind bit of notice. Like many journalists, he is an outsider who doesn\u2019t give a damn what people think. Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet is more than twice as privileged as the one Theresa May appointed in 2016, judging by how many of its members were privately educated, according to the Sutton Trust, the social mobility charity. It says 64% of Johnson\u2019s cabinet was privately educated, 27% went to a comprehensive, while 9% attended a grammar school. Here is an extract from the Sutton Trust\u2019s news release. This proportion of alumni of independent schools is more than twice that of Theresa May\u2019s 2016 cabinet (30%), slightly more than Cameron\u2019s 2015 cabinet (50%) and similar to the 2010 coalition cabinet (62%). This means that cabinet ministers are nine times more likely to have gone to a fee-paying school for all or part of their secondary education than the general population, of which 7% went to private schools. However, the chancellor, foreign secretary, home secretary \u2013 and importantly the new education secretary \u2013 were among those educated at state schools. The proportion of independently educated ministers attending cabinet is less than earlier cabinets under Conservative Prime Ministers, John Major (71% in 1992) and Margaret Thatcher (91% in 1979). Tony Blair and Gordon Brown both had 32% of those attending cabinet privately educated, while 25% of Clement Attlee\u2019s first cabinet had been privately educated. Of the 33 ministers attending Boris Johnson\u2019s new cabinet, 45% went to Oxford or Cambridge universities. This compares with 31% of all Conservative MPs, 20% of Labour MPs and 24% of all MPs. A further 24% of Johnson\u2019s cabinet were educated at other Russell Group universities (excluding Oxbridge). Boris Johnson continues the academic dynasty at Number 10 that stretches back to before the start of World War 2: except for Gordon Brown, every prime minister since 1937 who attended university was educated at one institution \u2013 Oxford. From Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen Theresa May did promise last autumn to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the EU, even in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but her government did not legislate for this. At an earlier point in the process she refused to give that assurance, on the grounds that it would give away negotiating leverage, even though Labour was saying the UK should guarantee these rights unconditionally. Jacob Rees-Mogg is replying to Valerie Vaz. He says Labour can consult Erskine May online for free. Even he could do that, he says. He says Labour is meant to be modern. But Labour could buy a paper copy, he says. It would be a good investment. On the possibility of parliament being prorogued for Brexit, Rees-Mogg says Boris Johnson has said that he views this as an arcane mechanism, and that he does not want to use arcane mechanisms. Rees-Mogg says that, as he is now bound by cabinet collective responsibility, that is his view too. On Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, Rees-Mogg says he will take this issue up, and will do so every week. He says the first duty of the government is to look after its citizens. The way she has been treated is shameful, he says. Valerie Vaz is still responding to Jacob Rees-Mogg. She says that Rees-Mogg has staff, so he will not need to bring his nanny. She asks if Labour can get a complimentary copy of Erskine May. It is available online, but she says it would be useful to have a hard copy. (Buying one costs \u00a3300.) She asks Rees-Mogg to confirm that Dominic Cummings, who has just been hired as a policy adviser by Boris Johnson, will not be given a Commons pass because he was found in contempt of parliament. She asks about Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, saying she has promised to raise it every week until Nazanin is free. Will Boris Johnson agree to meet her husband? Jacob Rees-Mogg, the new leader of the Commons, is taking business questions now. He reads out the Commons business for the week starting Tuesday 3 September, when the recess ends. It\u2019s all routine stuff. Valerie Vaz, the shadow leader of the Commons, is now responding. She says it is not a very \u201cenergised\u201d list. (See 10.03am.) Penny Mordaunt, who was sacked as defence secretary by Boris Johnson yesterday, was doorstepped by Sky News this morning. She said the cabinet had her full support. But she refused to answer when asked what Johnson said to her yesterday. Here is a Guardian panel with views on the new cabinet, with contributions from Aditya Chakrabortty, Sonia Sodha, Katy Balls, Paul Mason and Martha Gill. During the Tory leadership campaign, Boris Johnson made repeated play of the claim that his team as London mayor was \u201cbasically a feminocracy\u201d, saying he would promote women to top jobs. And while the proportion of women in the four great jobs of state is still the same as at the end of Theresa May\u2019s time in No 10 \u2013 25%, with May as PM replaced by Priti Patel as home secretary \u2013 the proportion of women attending cabinet has actually fallen. May had 29 people in her final cabinet meetings, eight of whom were women, or 27.6%. Under the official list of Johnson\u2019s team sent round by No 10 earlier today (see 9.30am), he also has eight women, but among an expanded group of 33, so 24.2%. Defenders of Johnson might point out that he has two more full cabinet members than May \u2013 seven out of 23 against her final tally of five from 23. Either way it is, as best, no real progression. Grant Shapps, the new transport secretary, was on message as he left cabinet. Asked how it went, and what the mood was like, he replied: \u201cVery good, energised.\u201d Energise is, of course, the word Boris Johnson used himself in his victory speech on Tuesday to describe his mission. According to the Press Association, Boris Johnson told his new cabinet it was \u201cwonderful to see this new team assembled here\u201d which respects the \u201cdepth and breadth of talent in our extraordinary party\u201d. He went on: As you all know we have a momentous task ahead of us, at a pivotal moment in our country\u2019s history. We are now committed, all of us, to leaving the European Union on October 31 or indeed earlier - no ifs, no buts. But we are not going to wait until October 31 to get on with a fantastic new agenda for our country, and that means delivering the priorities of the people. This is from James Cleverly, the new Conservative party chairman. There are four BME ministers in the full cabinet (out of 23), and another two in the \u201cattending cabinet\u201d category (out of 10). From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg From Sky\u2019s Sam Coates Sky News has just broadcast some footage from the opening of the cabinet meeting. Boris Johnson could be heard saying \u201cno ifs, but we\u2019re going to ....\u201d The rest was inaudible, but the cabinet seemed to like it, because we then saw them banging the table enthusiastically. Here is another picture of the new cabinet. Downing Street has just sent out the full cabinet list. For the record, here it is. The order in which ministers appear is important, because there is a hierarchy in cabinet and ministers are listed in order of seniority. It is a good cabinet for Old Etonians. Including those allowed to attend, there are are four of them on the list: Boris Johnson, his brother Jo, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Kwasi Kwarteng. The Rt Hon Boris Johnson MP, Prime Minister The Rt Hon Sajid Javid MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer The Rt Hon Dominic Raab MP, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and First Secretary of State The Rt Hon Priti Patel MP, Secretary of State for the Home Department The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Robert Buckland, QC MP, Lord Chancellor, Secretary of State for Justice The Rt Hon Stephen Barclay MP, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The Rt Hon Ben Wallace MP, Secretary of State for Defence The Rt Hon Matthew Hancock MP, Secretary of State for Health and Social Care The Rt Hon Andrea Leadsom MP, Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy The Rt Hon Elizabeth Truss MP, Secretary of State for International Trade and President of the Board of Trade The Rt Hon Amber Rudd MP, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and Minister for Women and Equalities The Rt Hon Gavin Williamson CBE MP, Secretary of State for Education The Rt Hon Theresa Villiers MP, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Robert Jenrick MP, Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government The Rt Hon Grant Shapps MP, Secretary of State for Transport The Rt Hon Julian Smith MP, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland The Rt Hon Alister Jack MP, Secretary of State for Scotland The Rt Hon Alun Cairns MP, Secretary of State for Wales The Rt Hon Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, Leader of the House of Lords, Lord Privy Seal The Rt Hon Nicky Morgan MP, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Alok Sharma MP, Secretary of State for International Development James Cleverly MP, Minister without Portfolio and Party Chair Attending Cabinet Rishi Sunak MP, Chief Secretary to the Treasury The Hon Jacob Rees-Mogg MP, Leader of the House of Commons and Lord President of the Council Mark Spencer MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury and Chief Whip The Rt Hon Geoffrey Cox QC MP, Attorney General Kwasi Kwarteng MP, Minister of State (for Energy), Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy Oliver Dowden CBE MP, Paymaster General and Minister for the Cabinet Office Jake Berry MP, Minister of State, Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government The Rt Hon Esther McVey MP, Minister of State (Housing), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government Jo Johnson MP, Minister of State (Universities), Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy and the Department for Education The Rt Hon Brandon Lewis MP, Minister of State (for Security), Home Office Boris Johnson is chairing his first cabinet as I write. And later he will address the Commons for the first time as prime minister, in a statement that may reveal more about how he intends to deliver Brexit and how he would like to govern Britain. But we learnt a huge amount about that yesterday, from the most wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle in modern times. On the plus side, as the former Downing Street adviser from the New Labour era, Theo Bertram, argues on Twitter this morning, you could describe it as remarkably successful. But it\u2019s a reshuffle that does not just involve a wholesale change in personnel; it is one that will fundamentally alter the way people perceive the Conservative party. At one stage during the referendum 2016 campaign, to the surprise of some observers, Vote Leave started acting like a shadow government, making \u201cmanifesto\u201d pledges like this one on cutting VAT on fuel. Now that strategy looks more understandable, because the Vote Leave campaign has effectively become the government. On the Today programme this morning Nick Boles, the former Conservative minister who now sits as an independent, said the reshuffle showed the hard right had taken over his old party. He explained: It is very clarifying because what it establishes beyond all doubt is that the Conservative party has now been fully taken over, top to bottom, by the hard right, that they\u2019re basically turning themselves into the Brexit party in order to hold off Nigel Farage. And those few elements remaining of the one-nation, liberal conservative, Cameron-style Conservatives - they are neutered captives in this cabinet. They\u2019ve had to sign up to the pledge to leave [the EU] at the end of October. There are other assessments, of course. We will be covering them throughout the course of the day. Here is our overnight lead on the reshuffle. Here is our guide to who is in the new cabinet. And here is our guide to the ministers who were sacked, or who chose to leave. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Boris Johnson chairs his first cabinet. After 10.30am: Jacob Rees-Mogg, the new leader of the Commons, takes business questions in the Commons. After 11.30am: Johnson makes a statement to MPs. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

But the letter, which was said to have come from a concerned farmer, was actually from a lobby group, the NSW Farmers Association, and was written nearly six months after the meetings were held. Confusion about the letter led to the crossbench voting down a Labor motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of Taylor and the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg. But Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s Leader in the Senate, said she would move again for an inquiry on Monday.</p> <p><strong>ANZ charged its customers fees for four and a half years after it was warned they were illegal</strong>,<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/26/anz-warned-fees-could-be-illegal-but-kept-charging-them-for-years-court-told\">the corporate regulator Asic has told the federal court</a>.

      "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Friday 26 July. Top stories The government has attempted to fend off a formal inquiry into controversial meetings between Angus Taylor and the environment department over endangered grasslands by producing a letter that purports to show the minister was acting in the interests of his constituents and not himself. But the letter, which was said to have come from a concerned farmer, was actually from a lobby group, the NSW Farmers Association, and was written nearly six months after the meetings were held. Confusion about the letter led to the crossbench voting down a Labor motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of Taylor and the then environment minister, Josh Frydenberg. But Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s Leader in the Senate, said she would move again for an inquiry on Monday. ANZ charged its customers fees for four and a half years after it was warned they were illegal, the corporate regulator Asic has told the federal court. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission initiated legal action against ANZ that could cost the bank tens or hundreds of millions of dollars in civil penalties, accusing the bank of making false or misleading statements on \u201cat least\u201d 1.3m occasions when it charged fees between 26 July 2013 and 23 February 2016. ANZ has denied any wrongdoing, telling the ASX it intends to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d any such allegations. Some 30,000 native animals have been moved by environmental contractors at an LNG plant in Western Australia in a seven-year program that\u2019s been lauded as the largest yet undertaken on an industrial site in Australia. Relocating terrestrial fauna was not part of the environmental conditions placed on the project but the project\u2019s zoologist, Scott Thompson, is urging other companies to follow Chevron\u2019s lead: \u201cThis company went above and beyond what they had to do [and] had exceptional outcomes.\u201d The animals included echidnas and more than 1,000 goannas, 1,000 snakes and 10,000 frogs. A rare northern quoll was also recorded. World Brussels has rebuffed Boris Johnson\u2019s outline of a revisited Brexit deal, with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker signalling the deal negotiated with Theresa May, including the Irish backstop, would remain. Papua New Guinea\u2019s new prime minister, James Marape, has vowed to be free from Australian aid dependence with 10 years, thanking Australia for its assistance, but flagging greater need across the Pacific. Four teenage boys have been charged with an aggravated hate crime for a London bus attack on a lesbian couple that captured global attention. The boys face a youth court on 21 August. Spain\u2019s caretaker prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has failed once again to form a functioning government after potential coalition party, Unidas Podemos, abstained during a key vote. A third failure could see the Spanish people head back to the polls for a fourth time in as many years. The professional boxing world is reeling from a second death inside a week after the 23-year-old Argentinian Hugo Santillan died from injuries sustained during a bout. It follows the death of the Russian fighter Maxim Dadashev. Opinion and analysis On Wednesday night the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, stood up in the House of Representatives and shared a terrible story \u2013 involving an Iranian family, a suicide, multiple more attempts, countless medical reports and a wait of many months despite five appeals, writes Katherine Murphy. Now the legislation that finally secured medical evacuation for the family off Nauru faces parliamentary repeal \u2013 and the Senate crossbench could play a decisive role. Luxury travel has been democratised for millions of Australians, writes Brigid Delaney. Things once out of reach to anyone but celebrities or the mega-rich have filtered down to the middle classes, courtesy of cheap flights, budget airlines, travel companies and the opportunity to take short-term leases on high-end private residences via Airbnb. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, outbound international travel by Australians nearly doubled in the past decade. \u201cI got to wondering (after being wedged off a footpath in London\u2019s Regent Street by four Australian women, walking abreast, their arms heavy with posh shopping bags): are Australians the new jet set class? Should the term Eurotrash be amended to Oztrash?\u201d Sport A week after an epic Netball World Cup final, most of Australia\u2019s Diamonds are straight back into action in the domestic Super Netball competition. As former star Sharni Layton writes, the ramifications of this for player welfare are huge. Frenchman Julian Alaphillipe\u2019s remarkable Tour de France yellow jersey defence has continued after Geraint Thomas and Egan Bernal failed to register significant time gains on a bruising stage 18 in the Alps. Thinking time: How the state runs business in China Private enterprise was once the driver of much of China\u2019s prodigious economic growth, responsible for half of all investment in the country and about 75% of economic output in 2012. But since then, under President Xi Jinping, the Communist party has returned to being the ultimate arbiter in business as well as politics, writes Richard McGregor. Surrounded by an \u201cearly optimistic glow\u201d after his ascension to the leadership, Xi was welcomed by western commentators as an appreciator of the market system \u2013 but that has shifted dramatically. Why does this matter? With the Chinese state wielding a heavier touch over corporations the blurring of economic and political aims \u2013 as seen through the Huawei scandals \u2013 this becomes increasingly concerning for the west. Media roundup Scott Morrison continues to shake up Australia\u2019s defence agencies, with a new Asio chief set to start in September, in addition to last week\u2019s announcement of a new federal police commissioner, writes the Australian. Thirty-three years after the death of Anita Cobby, the man handed a life sentence for her murder has ended up in the same hospital as her widower, John Cobby, reports the Daily Telegraph. And, the last time the Australian stock market was riding this high was November 2007, prompting as much concern as confidence, writes the Sydney Morning Herald. Global debt has just hit 300%, but the picture isn\u2019t as bleak on the local front. Coming up A test case against Centrelink\u2019s robodebt system will be heard in Melbourne\u2019s federal court. A trial date in body modification case that ended in death will be set in NSW district court.

      "bodyText": "Nasa has decided that only the industrial corporation Northrop Grumman can supply it with an astronaut habitation module in time to meet the White House\u2019s directive of landing humans on the moon again by 2024. The decision was made public in a Justification for Other than Full and Open Competition document that was published on 19 July 2019. This move bypasses Nasa\u2019s traditional approach to awarding contracts for its spacecraft. Usually it requests bids from industry and then evaluates the responses but in this case, Nasa decided such a procedure would take too much time. Northrop Grumman\u2019s habitation module will be based on its existing Cygnus cargo craft that currently supplies the International Space Station (ISS). The main body of Cygnus is pressurised and this will be converted into a habitation module for astronauts. It will be part of the Lunar Gateway, a small space station in orbit around the moon that will act as a layover point for astronauts before they descend to the lunar surface. In May, Nasa announced that Maxar Technologies would provide the Gateway\u2019s power and propulsion element, which will be mated to the Cygnus-derived habitation module. Launch is scheduled for December 2023.",

      "bodyText": "The high-profile Eurosceptic rebel Steve Baker has rejected a job on Boris Johnson\u2019s frontbench, saying he did not want to repeat the \u201cpowerlessness\u201d he felt as a junior minister before he quit over objections to Theresa May\u2019s deal. Baker, the vice-chair of the hard Brexit European Research Group and close ally of the newly promoted Jacob Rees-Mogg, appeared to have been offered a post in the Cabinet Office on Thursday night but after more than an hour inside Downing Street he said he had turned down the prime minister\u2019s offer. The rejection is the first major hitch in Johnson\u2019s reshuffle, with the prime minister hoping to keep Baker \u201cinside the tent\u201d as one of the key leaders of rebel Brexiters in parliament. \u201cWith regret, I have turned down a ministerial job,\u201d he tweeted, before adding that \u201cdisaster awaits\u201d if Britain does not leave the European Union by 31 October. Baker had hinted at some frustration with the reshuffle. He told reporters he was \u201cminister for receiving unanswerable press enquiries\u201d and also \u201cminister for long waits\u201d. In July last year, Baker resigned as Brexit minister along with then Brexit secretary David Davis over disagreements with government policy. Earlier in the evening, Johnson handed plum ministerial roles to some of his closest allies, Kit Malthouse, Conor Burns and Nigel Adams, as he purged more ministers who have made clear they could not stomach a no-deal Brexit. Ministers sacked by Johnson on Thursday included the health minister Stephen Hammond and the Foreign Office minister Harriett Baldwin, both backers of Johnson\u2019s leadership rival Jeremy Hunt. Hammond had only recently returned to a role in government, having voted against May in 2017 in order to grant MPs a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal. In his parting tweet, Hammond said he remains \u201cabsolutely opposed\u201d to no deal. Malthouse, a former City Hall colleague of Johnson who was hotly tipped for promotion to the cabinet, was given a more junior role than he is understood to have been expecting. He will be police minister, a brief with a close fit having been deputy mayor for policing during Johnson\u2019s time as London mayor. Burns and Adams, two of Johnson\u2019s closest parliamentary friends and allies who were a constant presence at his side during the leadership contest, were also both promoted to international trade minister and culture minister respectively. Burns earlier defended Johnson\u2019s aim of only promoting MPs who would be sure to back a no-deal Brexit, hinting he did not want the ill-discipline of May\u2019s ministers. George Eustice, the former fisheries minister who quit the government in March over May\u2019s plan to extend article 50, was given a role back in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.",

There are two more days to unseat the yellow jersey holder who is now riding a rising wave of goodwill that as yet shows little sign of breaking. \u201cI\u2019m aware I\u2019m getting a lot of attention but I don\u2019t feel pressure,\u201d Alaphilippe said. \u201cI am used to having pressure and that motivates me but I\u2019m aware that something is happening with all the eyes of the public on the Tour at the moment. I see it in the peloton and by the roads and with the press \u2013 the messages that I get and the craziness. \u201cI hope it lasts to the end. We all dream of that. But I\u2019m still a realist \u2013 today was a big step, but there is still tomorrow and the next day but my approach is not changing. I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019ve given everything.\u201d Alaphilippe, the roadrunner who has dodged every carefully planned ambush, is just two tough stages from one of the most unexpected and surprising victories in the long history of the Tour. Brailsford, Thomas and Bernal, lacking the engine room nous of Rowe and the talismanic leadership of Froome, must now make sure they are not his fall guys.",

      "bodyText": "The new home secretary, Priti Patel, holds a \u00a31,000-an hour contract with a global communications firm that supplies products and services to the UK government, the Guardian can reveal. Patel, who was appointed on Wednesday by the new prime minister, Boris Johnson, as a part of a wholesale gutting of the cabinet, has been working for Viasat for the past three months as a strategic adviser on a salary of \u00a35,000 a month for five hours\u2019 work a month. She recorded the role on the MPs\u2019 register of interests, and the contract is due to expire on 31 July. Viasat, a Californian company with a UK base in Farnborough, supplies services and products to the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The MoD works in collaboration with the Home Office on numerous projects, including the Innovation and Research Insights (IRIS) Unit, which sets up technology-based contracts for both departments. Patel, who was forced to resign from government two years ago for failing to disclose secret meetings with Israeli ministers, is understood to have been advising Viasat on a matter relating to India. Patel, whose Gujarati Indian parents migrated to the UK in the 1960s, was formerly David Cameron\u2019s champion for the Indian diaspora community in the UK and is a supporter of India\u2019s populist prime minister, Narendra Modi. Ed Davey, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesperson, said: \u201cPriti Patel has already been forced out of the cabinet once for dodgy meetings.

She receives a salary of \u00a345,000 a year for 20 hours work a month in the role, which she also declared on the MPs\u2019 register of interests. The Essex MP, whose appointment as home secretary was met with \u201cextreme concern\u201d from human rights groups and immigration campaigners, will sit in cabinet alongside the new defence secretary, Ben Wallace, a former Home Office minister. Each minister is responsible, on appointment, for disclosing their relevant interests to the permanent secretary of their department, a role held at the Home Office by Sir Philip Rutnam. The current process is that all ministerial interests will be scrutinised by the Prime Minister\u2019s Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests. A government spokesperson said: \u201cThe process for ensuring that no conflict arises between a minister\u2019s public duties and their private interests is set out in the Ministerial Code.\u201d The Guardian has contacted Patel for comment.",

      "bodyText": "Brussels has roundly rebuffed Boris Johnson after he laid down tough conditions for the new Brexit deal he hopes to strike over the summer. Speaking to the House of Commons for the first time as prime minister on Thursday, Johnson reiterated his campaign pledge of ditching the Irish backstop and promised to ramp up preparations for a no-deal Brexit immediately. \u201cI would prefer us to leave the EU with a deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI would much prefer it. I believe that it is possible even at this late stage, and I will work flat-out to make it happen. \u201cBut certain things need to be clear: the withdrawal agreement negotiated by my predecessor has been three times rejected by this house; its terms are unacceptable to this parliament and to this country.\u201d In a phone call later in the day, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, signalled the EU27\u2019s determination to stick with the deal negotiated with Theresa May\u2019s government \u2013 which includes the backstop. \u201cPresident Juncker listened to what Prime Minister Johnson had to say, reiterating the EU\u2019s position that the withdrawal agreement is the best and only agreement possible \u2013 in line with the European council guidelines,\u201d a commission spokesperson said. Juncker told Johnson the EU was willing to \u201cadd language\u201d to the political declaration \u2013 the non-binding document that covers the future relationship \u2013 but would only consider any other proposals \u201cproviding they are compatible with the withdrawal agreement\u201d. The spokesperson added that the two men had swapped mobile numbers. Earlier, Johnson outlined to a noisy Commons his vision of a post-Brexit UK in 2050 as \u201cthe greatest and most prosperous economy in Europe at the centre of a new network of trade deals\u201d. In a speech that was loudly cheered by many Conservative MPs, he said all members of his new cabinet were committed to leaving the EU on 31 October \u201cwhatever the circumstances \u2013 and to do otherwise would cause a catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system\u201d. He also said he would ramp up no-deal preparations, which his official spokesman later confirmed was likely to include additional spending, and a significant public information campaign. Michael Gove will coordinate no-deal planning across the government. The Irish government expressed concern at Johnson\u2019s approach to Brexit as tension began to mount over the increased risk of no deal. Michael Creed, Ireland\u2019s agriculture minister, described the new government\u2019s stance, and the composition of Johnson\u2019s top team, as \u201calarming\u201d. \u201cThe makeup of this government seems to be a mirror image of [Johnson\u2019s] own viewpoint substantially and obviously that would be of concern to us,\u201d he told RT\u00c9 radio. \u201cWhat the [Irish] government is concerned about now is the approach of new administration in the UK to the withdrawal agreement,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cObviously what we are hearing from the [UK] government is quite alarming.\u201d In Brussels, meanwhile, Michel Barnier warned that such \u201ccombative\u201d rhetoric was an attempt to crack the EU\u2019s unity. In a note sent to diplomats, the bloc\u2019s chief negotiator counselled the EU27 to stick to its principles in the face of the prime minister\u2019s no-deal threats. \u201cPM Johnson has stated that if an agreement is to be reached it goes by way of eliminating the backstop. This is of course unacceptable and not within the mandate of the European council,\u201d he warned. In comments that signalled the growing belief in Brussels that the UK is heading towards a general election, Barnier wrote: \u201cI note also the many strong reactions to the speech in the House of Commons. In this context we must follow carefully the further political and economic reactions and developments in the UK following this speech. \u201cIn any case, what remains essential on our side is to remain calm, stick to our principles and guidelines and show solidarity and unity of the 27.\u201d Many MPs on both sides of the House of Commons believe Johnson\u2019s bid to negotiate a new Brexit deal are merely the prelude to a general election, given the high bar he has set for success and the Tories\u2019 slim majority. Johnson is announcing that the recruitment of 20,000 additional police officers will start within weeks \u2013 an eye-catching promise first made during his leadership campaign, that could sit comfortably in a Tory manifesto. \u201cAs I said on the steps of Downing Street this week, my job as prime minister is to make our streets safer. People want to see more officers in their neighbourhoods, protecting the public and cutting crime,\u201d he said. Increasing the number of officers by 20,000 will only partially reverse the deep cuts made since 2010. The new government is also announcing the creation of a new \u201cnational policing board\u201d, chaired by the home secretary, Priti Patel, in what she described as \u201cthe start of a new relationship between the government and the police\u201d. Other election-ready pledges made in Johnson\u2019s first 48 hours in Downing Street included upgrading 20 hospitals, fixing the broken social care system, cutting GP waiting times and rolling out full-fibre broadband across the country. The presence of the Vote Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings in No 10 has also fuelled speculation about an autumn poll. Johnson will make a series of campaign-style visits in the coming days \u2013 including to Scotland, where the Conservative leader, Ruth Davidson, has expressed some concerns about his approach. Outlining his Brexit stance to MPs on Thursday, Johnson said he was ready to \u201cnegotiate in good faith\u201d to find an alternative to the Irish backstop. \u201cI do not accept the argument that says that these issues can only be solved by all or part of the UK remaining in the customs union or in the single market,\u201d he said. \u201cThe evidence is that other arrangements are perfectly possible, and are also perfectly compatible with the Belfast or Good Friday agreement, to which we are of course steadfastly committed.\u201d Challenged by Labour\u2019s Hilary Benn about comments from the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, ruling out a new withdrawal agreement, Johnson said the question was \u201credolent of the kind of defeatism and negativity that we\u2019ve had over the last three years\u201d. \u201cWhy begin by assuming that our EU friends will not wish to compromise?\u201d he asked. Similarly, when another Labour backbencher, Yvette Cooper, asked Johnson about what practical solutions could be used for the Irish border in the absence of a trade deal or backstop, he replied that there were \u201cabundant facilitations already available\u201d.",

We\u2019ve not been very good at Test cricket for quite some time and his personal form has been shonky of late (he hasn\u2019t averaged over 40 in a series since we were last in Australia). Although it\u2019s really hard to put a finger on it, something just doesn\u2019t \u2018feel right\u2019 about the dressing room (the Bairstow \u2018picking himself\u2019 issue as someone pointed out earlier, is one example), and I just wonder if giving it to someone like Buttler might make more sense. I\u2019d be prepared to wager up to 5 of my hard earned pounds that he won\u2019t be captain for the winter tour. And perhaps push to 10 pounds to say that he shouldn\u2019t be. What do you think?\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve been unsure about him as Test captain since that Ashes tour 18 months ago. I think a few things have gone in his favour \u2013 the lack of perceived alternatives, the focus on the World Cup, a fortunate but stirring 4-1 win over India. The other thing is that England don\u2019t sack Test captains any more. I\u2019m not saying he <em>should </em>be sacked but it should certainly be discussed if England lose the Ashes. This winter is a great time for a reboot of the Test team. Then England can be good at Test cricket until they have a shambolic 2023 World Cup, at which point they\u2019ll focus on ODI cricket for four years, and so on.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d39dfce8f0845f89e31459d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T16:59:49.300Z\">5.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>75th over: England 296-9 (Broad 14, Stone 0) </strong>Broad survives an appeal - and then a <strong>review</strong> - for LBW, having underedged a sweep onto the pad. <strong>England lead by 174. </strong>It\u2019s going to be a helluva morning session at Lord\u2019s tomorrow.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T17:00:00.436Z\">at 6.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d39dfa38f08cf92bb77700b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T16:58:37.847Z\">5.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>74th over: England 293-9 (Broad 11, Stone 0)</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d39df418f08d0b6ca537c7e\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T16:57:42.222Z\">5.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">WICKET!

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s what the main man had to say about his innings: Here\u2019s Vic Marks\u2019 report from Lord\u2019s A chase of around 200 in the fourth innings isn\u2019t easy, but Ireland will be batting on a third-day rather than a fifth-day pitch. It\u2019s such a great opportunity - not just to beat England, but to pull off a maiden Test victory that would go straight into legend. The covers are on, with thunderstorms forecast, so there will no more play today. England will resume tomorrow with a lead of 181; Ireland\u2019s players will arrive at Lord\u2019s knowing they have a great chance to beat England, in a Test match, at Lord\u2019s. Good luck getting a good night\u2019s sleep, chaps. \u201cHi there young Rob (I am pushing 60),\u201d says Phil Keegan. \u201cThere is a lot chat and gossip about YJB getting his own way and picking himself etc, but is there any actual evidence for this? I think his place in the test side should be up for debate, I am just wondering where all this gossip comes from.\u201d It was inferred from comments made by him, Trevor Bayliss and possibly others during the winter tours. I have no idea whether it\u2019s fair, which is why I\u2019d be loath to rush to judgement on that. The thing that troubles me slightly is that he keeps missing straight ones on 0. On the hottest day in the history of ... ever, Ireland\u2019s bowlers did do well to drag their team back into the game either side of tea. When England were 171 for one, with Jack Leach apparently closing in on a Test hundred, almost everyone assumed they would go on to score 500 and win easily. But then Ireland took seven wickets for 77 through a combination of good bowling and lamentable batting to set up the tantalising prospect of a staggering victory. England lead by 181. Almost a third of those (55, to be precise, or 30.39 per cent) have come since they lost their eighth wicket. I fear those runs will prove decisive tomorrow. 77.4 overs: England 303-9 (Broad 21, Stone 0) That will probably be it for the day, although play can theoretically resume at any point until 6.30pm. 77th over: England 302-9 (Broad 20, Stone 0) A maiden from Adair to Stone. There is nothing in the pitch to worry the Ireland batsmen during their runchase. I suspect the biggest danger will be a fear of an historic victory. We\u2019ve seen that many times before. 76th over: England 302-9 (Broad 20, Stone 0) Broad is beaten twice by Thompson, but then he picks the bouncer and hooks for six! \u201cAfternoon Rob, here\u2019s a teaser,\u201d says David Horn. \u201cAt what point do we start questioning Root\u2019s captaincy of this team? We\u2019ve not been very good at Test cricket for quite some time and his personal form has been shonky of late (he hasn\u2019t averaged over 40 in a series since we were last in Australia). Although it\u2019s really hard to put a finger on it, something just doesn\u2019t \u2018feel right\u2019 about the dressing room (the Bairstow \u2018picking himself\u2019 issue as someone pointed out earlier, is one example), and I just wonder if giving it to someone like Buttler might make more sense. I\u2019d be prepared to wager up to 5 of my hard earned pounds that he won\u2019t be captain for the winter tour. And perhaps push to 10 pounds to say that he shouldn\u2019t be. What do you think?\u201d I\u2019ve been unsure about him as Test captain since that Ashes tour 18 months ago. I think a few things have gone in his favour \u2013 the lack of perceived alternatives, the focus on the World Cup, a fortunate but stirring 4-1 win over India. The other thing is that England don\u2019t sack Test captains any more. I\u2019m not saying he should be sacked but it should certainly be discussed if England lose the Ashes. This winter is a great time for a reboot of the Test team. Then England can be good at Test cricket until they have a shambolic 2023 World Cup, at which point they\u2019ll focus on ODI cricket for four years, and so on. 75th over: England 296-9 (Broad 14, Stone 0) Broad survives an appeal - and then a review - for LBW, having underedged a sweep onto the pad. England lead by 174. It\u2019s going to be a helluva morning session at Lord\u2019s tomorrow. 74th over: England 293-9 (Broad 11, Stone 0) Curran\u2019s counter-attack is over. He pulled the new bowler Thompson high to deep square leg, where James McCollum calmly took the catch. Curran made a useful 37 from 29 balls. 73rd over: England 291-8 (Curran 36, Broad 10) The offspinner Andy McBrine returns to the attack. Curran, on the charge, clouts his third ball back over his head for six. One of the most impressive things about Curran is the variety of counter-attacking innings he has played in his year as a Test player. The match situation has generally been the same but Curran\u2019s approach has not. He is so intelligent for a 21-year-old batsman. \u201cI think I\u2019ve heard this before - I must have - but can we have Morgan as Captain of Reviews?\u201d says Nick Lezard. \u201cHe\u2019d be better at that sitting in the pavilion than certain captains and players are in the field.\u201d How long before a team appoints a specialist DRS coach? I always thought Matt Prior was brilliant, especially as he had to negotiate with some particularly excitable bowlers. 72nd over: England 284-8 (Curran 29, Broad 10) Curran really is giving it some humpty. He drives Adair over mid-off for four before mistiming a swipe that lands just in front of Porterfield, running back from mid-off. These are good runs for England, and Broad adds four more with a flick off the pads. This pair have added 36 in 4.1 overs. \u201cWere you dropping in from Mars and watching England\u2019s Test batting in this match (and over recent matches),\u201d begins Gary Naylor, \u201cyou might assess the batsmen\u2019s techniques and come up with an order that runs something like: Curran, Woakes, Leach, Root, Denly, Roy, Burns, Stone, Moeen, Bairstow, Broad.\u201d That\u2019s very harsh on Stuart Broad. Har har. 71st over: England 273-8 (Curran 22, Broad 6) DCI Curran has deduced that he needs to get some runs quicksmart, because Broad and Stone are unlikely to hang around for long. He flashes Rankin through extra cover for four, a brilliant shot, and then walks across the stumps to flip the next delivery over fine leg for six! Curran, who yet again has been stimulated by adversity, has 22 from 14 balls. That does impress me much. \u201cYour mention of Root padding his average reminded me of a conversation I had yesterday with a friend from Belfast,\u201d says Hubert O\u2019Hearn. \u201cI heard an expression that was new to me that serves as a jinx warning: \u2018Not the first Englishman to be caught with smug on his face.\u2019\u201d Heh, very good. 70th over: England 260-8 (Curran 12, Broad 4) Broad drives Adair over cover point for four to get off the mark. England lead by 138. That surely isn\u2019t enough, unless Ireland suffer a particularly acute dose of finishinglineitis. \u201cI think there\u2019s more than an argument the Test team\u2019s culture is rotten!\u201d says Andrew Hurley. \u201cBairstow is at times a spoiled brat who wants his own way. Now his batting is awful (Starc can\u2019t wait) he should be dropped. The culture stems from a weak captain, and from two bowlers who, even if great, are a law unto themselves. It\u2019s not Archer who is needed from the ODI team, it\u2019s Morgan to tell certain players to grow up!\u201d Come on Andrew, tell us what you really think. I liked the idea of Morgan the specialist Test captain, even at this late stage of his career, but I changed my mind after that interview with Rob Key on Sky Sports last week. The way he spoke about his mental exhaustion suggests he\u2019ll struggle to go back to the same well, never mind a new one. It\u2019s a shame because I think he\u2019s close to genius as a captain. 69th over: England 256-8 (Curran 12, Broad 0) Boyd Rankin returns to the attack ahead of schedule in an attempt to rough up the tail. His first ball, a stiff loosener, is dragged round the corner for four by Curran \u2013 and then Curran is dropped by Porterfield at mid-on! It was a very difficult one-handed chance as he leapt to his left, and he couldn\u2019t hang on. 68th over: England 248-8 (Curran 4, Broad 0) England have lost their last seven wickets for 77. Many of them were frittered away, but there has been some fine bowling too, especially in the dismissals of Bairstow and Moeen Ali. \u201cI\u2019d suggest that if Root did tell Bairstow to review that suggests that he\u2019s overly keen to keep YJB (with a Y) onside, which is entirely consistent with most of their other interactions,\u201d says Felix Wood. \u201cAnd that\u2019s more worrying. Root has never shaken the air of the young buck who is thrilled to be in the England team and wants to impress the bigger boys, which isn\u2019t a good look for a captain.\u201d He\u2019s an interesting, contradictory character, Root \u2013 the \u2018little boy\u2019, as Ricky Ponting described him, yet also ruthless and tough enough to achieve so much. I can\u2019t work him out. It\u2019s probably fair to say he\u2019s not a natural captain. Adair has another one! Woakes drives loosely at a full, wide delivery and edges straight to Balbirnie at second slip. Ireland are so close - so darned close - to one of the greatest victories in Test history. 67th over: England 248-7 (Woakes 13, Curran 4) Woakes skids back in his crease to cut McBrine for four. I\u2019d be tempted to bring on Thompson for McBrine, who looks relatively innocuous. I\u2019ve done it again, haven\u2019t I? Meanwhile, on Sky SPorts, Nasser Hussain has lost his rag in majestic style. \u201cWhy is Joe Root charging an 82mph bowler? Why do England always try to hit their way out of their trouble? Who\u2019s their top scorer today: it\u2019s the nightwatchman, who played properly!\u201d Nobody rants quite like Nasser. 66th over: England 243-7 (Woakes 8, Curran 4) It was a loose stroke from Root, whose wicket puts Ireland in a barely believable position. He made 31 runs, and none of them were cheap. Neil Bowles was right and I was wrong. Sam Curran, England\u2019s crisis-management specialist, drives his first ball crisply through extra cover for four - but then he edges Adair just short of second slip. This is great stuff. Gone gone gone! Yep, gone! England are in serious trouble now. Root, on the walk, snicks a drive off the new bowler Adair, and Wilson flies in front of first slip to take an excellent catch. 65th over: England 239-6 (Root 31, Woakes 8) Root comes down the track and screws the ball back towards the bowler McBrine, who tries unsuccessfully to do the Roger Harper. I think Root would have been home anyway. 64th over: England 236-6 (Root 30, Woakes 8) Root is playing with discipline and patience, resisting a series of seductive deliveries outside off stump from Murtagh. Then when Murtagh goes straighter, Root is able to flick him to leg for a single. Every little helps. \u201cSince the Irish are doing their best to demonstrate the strength of the underrated and largely ignored minor cricket nations, can I plug the inaugural finals of the European Cricket League which starts on July 29th in La Manga, Spain,\u201d says Guy Semmens. \u201cIt is run by an ex-pat Aussie based in Germany, and backed by some Dutch and Swiss guys involved in the football Champions League. If your readers happen to be anywhere near the vicinity it is free and ought to be a great three days. And if not, the whole thing is streamed online for free (take note ECB).\u201d That\u2019s a lovely idea. 63rd over: England 235-6 (Root 28, Woakes 8) Woakes gets off the mark with a very classy back-foot drive for four, and doubles his score by deliberately thick edging the next ball to third man. He has happy memories of batting on this ground - his two highest Test scores are at Lord\u2019s, including his maiden century against India a year ago. \u201cNot for the first time in recent years, I find myself reflecting that if England had merely batted really, really poorly in their first innings, rather than absolutely abysmally, they\u2019d be in a decent position in this game,\u201d says Robert Ellson. \u201cThink the art of cobbling together a dirty little score has been lost somewhere along the line.\u201d Yep, the modern batsman has no room for the penal experience. 62nd over: England 226-6 (Root 26, Woakes 0) Root edges Murtagh this far short of Stirling at first slip and away for four. What a chance for Ireland! Stirling has been standing in an unusually narrow position, almost behind the wicketkeeper Wilson, and that\u2019s probably why Root survived. Stirling did not see the ball until it was past the keeper Wilson; with the extra reaction time, he would surely have taken the catch. \u201cAs an Irishman I have to agree that we have the weakest bowling attack in Test cricket,\u201d says Billy Mills. \u201cIt\u2019d be a very poor team that got bowled out for under 90 by us, that I can tell you with considerable confidence.\u201d 61st over: England 219-6 (lead by 97; Root 19, Woakes 0) \u201cI\u2019m starting to worry that even Geoffrey Boycott may soon start to \u2018hide behind patronising half-truths and insincere platitudes\u2019,\u201d says Kim Thonger. \u201cThen we shall all be in the Corridor of Insincerity.\u201d Boyd Rankin has bounced Moeen Ali out! He fenced tamely at a lifter outside off stump and got a thin edge through to Wilson. That\u2019s really good bowling from Rankin, although it was another soft dismissal for Moeen. His Test batting has also gone to seed. But never mind all that, because Ireland now have a serious chance of an astounding victory. 60th over: England 218-5 (Root 18, Ali 9) With Murtagh wobbling the ball at around 75mph, Joe Root is entitled to suffer flashbacks to the water torture inflicted on him by Colin de Grandhomme in the World Cup final. But there is no run-rate pressure today, which allows Root to manoeuvre the occasional single or boundary. He looks comfortable and determined, probably more so because of his part in Joe Denly\u2019s run out. \u201cHi Rob, I find it interesting that you think Bairstow\u2019s place should be under scrutiny,\u201d says Gareth Fitzgerald. \u201cI agree, but it appears that the process for reviewing Bairstow\u2019s place is to see what Bairstow thinks and go with his decision. I still think Ben Foakes was very unlucky to be dropped.\u201d I thought Foakes was treated ever so shoddily. There\u2019s an argument \u2013 only an argument \u2013 that the culture of the Test team is a bit rotten. But we shouldn\u2019t be too judgemental because none of us know what has actually happened in the dressing-room. The on-field evidence, the stuff we see, suggests Bairstow has lost his way as a Test cricketer. All things being equal he is England\u2019s second-best batsman, but an average of 29 in the last two years suggests not everything is equal. 59th over: England 217-5 (Root 17, Ali 9) Moeen hooks Rankin in the air but well short of the man at deep square leg. Moeen has fallen into the leg trap a few times before, and Ireland\u2019s tactics are clear for all to see. \u201cAfter some years of baiting Jonny Bairstow, Smyth (with a \u2018y\u2019) has descended to the level of trolling,\u201d says Ron Rose. \u201cGive it up, Smyth (with a \u2018y\u2019) it\u2019s deeply unpleasant, seriously nasty.\u201d As opposed to ridiculing someone for having an Irish surname. What\u2019s the word for that? 58th over: England 213-5 (Root 16, Ali 7) Tim Murtagh returns after tea, with Ireland one wicket away from being in an unimaginably good position. The keeper Gary Wilson comes up to the stumps, to stop Root batting outside his crease, but it can\u2019t stop him gliding a neat boundary to third man. \u201cOn TMS the commentators said that Root immediately told Bairstow to review,\u201d says Tom Paternoster-Howe, \u201cso perhaps the blame doesn\u2019t entirely lie with the out of form YJB.\u201d Ah, fair enough, although I\u2019m suspect he would have reviewed it anyway. There\u2019s an entitlement about his reviews that is hard to like. Teatime chit chat \u201cI love the OBO coverage, but the comment about Joe Root tucking in and compiling \u2018cheapish runs\u2019 is a bit disrespectful to the Ireland bowlers,\u201d says Neil Bowles. \u201cThis game is in the balance - England are effectively 77-5 and Ireland would fancy a run chase around the 150 mark. This game is closer than many might imagine. Keep up the (otherwise!) great work.\u201d I know what you mean, but wouldn\u2019t it be patronising to talk as if he\u2019s facing Starc and Cummins? Ireland have some fine bowlers \u2013 Murtagh and Adair have been really impressive in different ways, and Rankin was a cracking bowler in his prime \u2013 but they still probably have the weakest attack of the Test-playing nations. And at the time I made that comment, England were three wickets down (one a nightwatchman) on a perfect batting day. More than anything, I just find it interesting that some players like Kallis and Waugh were absolutely ruthless against the weaker teams. I do take your point, but I also think we have become so terrified of causing even the slighest offence that we hide behind patronising half-truths and insincere platitudes. Everyday life has become a PR exercise. Anyway, I\u2019m off to give loads of money to various charities, which I like to do every Thursday afternoon just to remind myself what\u2019s important in life get a coffee \u2013 see you in 15 minutes for the evening session. 57th over: England 209-5 (Root 12, Ali 7) Moeen Ali has a bit of a torrid time in the last over before tea, with Rankin driving him onto the back foot. The last two balls of the session are popped just short of short leg - the first off the glove, the second off the face of the bat. England go into tea with a lead of 87. 56th over: England 205-5 (Root 9, Ali 6) Moeen will play his way \u2013 it\u2019s the way he plays \u2013 and he steers Adair to third man for his first boundary. England lead by 83. They\u2019ll want at least another 167 before they start to feel comfortable. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen Geoffrey Boycott at Lord\u2019s,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cI\u2019m afraid I refrained from giving him the news that Jack Leach enjoys a higher average than him at No1.\u201d Darn you, Naylor, I thought I might be about to enjoy some Statsguru-based smartarsery. But you are right, Leach\u2019s 46.50 is higher than Boycott\u2019s 43.91. (Interesting that Boycott averaged 55.23 at No2, though.) 55th over: England 200-5 (Root 9, Ali 1) Root gets his first boundary with a crisp back cut off Rankin. Moeen then gets off the mark, and off a pair, which takes England\u2019s lead to a precarious 78. Without Jack Leach, they would be -14 ahead. \u201cAs a 62-year-old distance runner, I take issue with your suggestion that age is a barrier to athletic performance, and I direct you to the extraordinary Carlos Lopes,\u201d says Edward Collier. \u201cAt the age of 38, in the 1985 Rotterdam marathon, Lopes took 53 seconds off the world\u2019s best marathon time, setting a new standard of 2:07.12, and becoming the first man to run 42.195 km in less than 2 h 8 min.\u201d I can only apologise for forgetting when Usain Bolt lost his Olympic 100m title to that octogenarian chain-smoker from Grimsby. 54th over: England 194-5 (Root 4, Ali 0) Bairstow has made five ducks in his last seven Test innings at home. In some cultures, his place in the side might even be questioned! Jonny Bairstow has bagged a pair! It was brilliant bowling from Adair, who beat him twice outside off stump and then nipped one back to beat Bairstow\u2019s lunging push-drive and hit him on the flap of the pad. It was given out, and though Bairstow reviewed, replays showed it was umpire\u2019s call on height. That was a pathetic, brattish review from Bairstow, whose Test batting has gone to seed. But it was sensationally good from Adair, a forensic interrogation of an out-of-form player. 53rd over: England 194-4 (Root 4, Bairstow 0) England lead by 72. One more quick wicket could make things pretty interesting. Oh dear. Joe Root has dismissed Joe Denly with a dreadful run-out call. Denly was more than half way down the track when Root, who called for the run, changed his mind and sent him back. Kevin O\u2019Brien did the rest with a sharp throw to the bowler McBrine, and Denly kept on running back to the pavilion. That was an egregious shemozzle. 52nd over: England 194-3 (Denly 10, Root 4) In Tests in Zimbabwe, Jacques Kallis averaged 503. In Tests against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh, Steve Waugh averaged 273. But nobody puts an asterisk against their career averages because of it, and this a glorious chance for Joe Root to get some cheapish Test runs. A huge hundred, 163 or more I think, would also push his Test average back above 50. 51st over: England 191-3 (Denly 8, Root 3) The offspinner Andy McBrine replaces Thompson. England milk three singles, and life goes on. \u201cThanks for the clip,\u201d says the 48th over\u2019s Peter Lovell. \u201cThis might be a bit more interesting than I imagined! I\u2019m pretty sure that was Vic throwing in from the boundary as the pitch invasion happened (note so self\u2026work on my throwing), and is that Dickie Bird wielding a stump at the crowd?\u201d Yes I think it was Vic. I missed Dickie wielding a stump as I was drawn towards the, erm, robust law-enforcement at the batsman\u2019s end. 50th over: England 188-3 (Denly 7, Root 1) The impressive Mark Adair returns in place of Tim Murtagh, who needs to bowl short spells given that his age (37) is the same as the temperature at Lord\u2019s. He starts with a solid maiden to Denly. \u201cDonald Trump is US president,\u201d says Sam Blackledge. \u201cBoris Johnson is UK prime minister. Jack Leach has scored 92 opening the batting in a Test match. That\u2019s enough sun for me.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, Bobby Ewing has almost finished in the shower. 49th over: England 188-3 (Denly 7, Root 1) Root is beaten by a good delivery from Thompson, who has been much better in this spell. It helps that the ball is wobbling gently, which is what led to Jason Roy\u2019s wicket. This is a very good spell for Ireland, who have taken two for 19 in the last nine overs. \u201cHello Rob,\u201d says Geoff Wignall. \u201cWith all due credit and plaudits to Leach, I\u2019m still rather glad that the highest score by a nightwatchman for England remains a matchwinning 99 not out. It just feels right.\u201d 48th over: England 186-3 (Denly 6, Root 1) \u201cCan anyone out there explain the \u2018Crumpled Bard\u2019 nickname for Vic Marks?\u201d asks Pete Lovell. \u201cI happen to be playing him in the upcoming Bollywood film \u201983 about the Indian World Cup victory of that year and it would be good to get some last-minute insight into him. Filming starts in two-week and I\u2019m pretty sure all I\u2019ll have to do is be bowled out by Kapil Dev and stand around in the field a bit but you never know.\u201d Who\u2019s playing the heavy-footed bobby? (Keep your eye on leg stump at the batsman\u2019s end.) 47th over: England 185-3 (Denly 5, Root 1) One way or another, this summer will probably define Joe Root\u2019s time as England captain, so he\u2019d love to go into the Ashes on the back of a score. It\u2019s easy to forget he got a hundred in England\u2019s last Test, which was against West Indies in February 2016. He\u2019s been a second-innings specialist of late \u2013 in the last two years he averages 31 in the first innings and 54 in the second. 46th over: England 182-3 (Denly 3, Root 0) Tim Murtagh, fairytale killer. He has dismissed Jack Leach for a memorable 92, caught at second slip as he tried to drive a good delivery. Leach was dropped by the same fielder, Mark Adair, earlier in the over. He walks off to a standing ovation from the crowd and his team-mates. In time he will remember that with fondness, but for now he looks thoroughly cheesed off at missing out on a Test hundred. 45th over: England 182-2 (Leach 92, Denly 3) Leach forces Thompson through the covers for a couple to move into the nineties. This is all a bit surreal. No nightwatchman has made a Test hundred for England, although a few were stuck in the nineties: Alex Tudor, Harold Larwood, Eddie Hemmings and Jack Russell. 44th over: England 178-2 (Leach 89, Denly 3) An uppish extra-cover drive from Joe Denly lands just short of Adair and races away for a couple of runs. There are a whole heap of runs on offer at Lord\u2019s today, and those whose place is less secure will be desperate to take advantage. \u201cAt least Jason Roy has now written himself into the Ashes team, even if he was outscored by Leach,\u201d says John Starbuck. \u201cYou\u2019d think Stuart Broad and Sam Curran are also on the list. Maybe Leach could be the official all-rounder?\u201d Or a very good quiz question: who scored their maiden Test hundred and was dropped a few days later? 43rd over: England 176-2 (Leach 89, Denly 1) Thanks Tanya, hello everyone. One of these days, international cricket will be played at Lord\u2019s without something absolute bonkers happening. England, bowled out for 85 yesterday, have been outscored in the second innings by their nightwatchman-opener Jack Leach. I\u2019m sorry, what? 42nd over: England 175-2 (Leach 89, Denly 0) Jack Leach has now outscored England\u2019s first innings total! With a cover drive and a misfield, he brings his boundary total to 16 in this magnificent bit of Somerset magic. And thank you everyone - the crumpled bard it seems is Vic Marks! That\u2019s it from me as I handover to the peerless Rob Smyth. Thanks so much for all your emails and tweets (I will master new twitter by the Ashes) and sorry if it was too politics-heavy for some. I\u2019m off to climb into the freezer - happy afternoon! 41st over: England 171-2 (Leach 85 Denly 0) Roy was furious with himself for that reckless shot - ah we get the replay, he holds his position, gloves high together, for an amusingly long time. A flamboyant Roy-ish innings, which might well be remembered as the time he was outscored by his nightwatchman. A bit more of a spring now in the Irish step. A full, straight ball from Thompson and Roy swings with thumping flair... and misses. 40th over: England 169-1 (Leach 85 Roy 70) Murtagh gets whistled back into the attack from the pavilion end and Leach drives uppishly over a leaping Boyd Rankin\u2019s head for four more as he moves into the eighties. And then a whip through extra-cover, down the hill and over the boundary. The partnership is now 143 from 176 balls and the century is written in the stars. Tom Fitzpatrick corroborates the story about Simon Coveney but reiterates that he is not one of the men in the photo. 39th over: England 161-1 (Leach 77, Roy 70) Jack Leach has a thwack over gully for four more off Rankin. And this is fascinating, Aleem Dar calls no ball as Ireland contrive to have three fielders behind square on the leg side. I love this email from Charles Sheldrick: \u201cJack Leach is officially now the second best all-rounder from Somerset to play for England, overtaking The Crumpled Bard of the Mendips, only a little way to go before he is challenging ITB for the top spot....\u201d But I\u2019m struggling - the Crumpled Bard? 38th over: England 155-1 (Leach 72, Roy 70) Are we going to have to put Jason Rosy\u2019s wrists in the archive alongside Boycott\u2019s obstinance and Murali\u2019s elbow? He cuts on the front foot, all wristy elegance, for four. Then another down through third man. Then he attempts to come forward to a short one from Adair and somehow loses his shoe in the process. He then tries to upper-cut the last ball and misses. He is an incredibly watchable cricketer. And that is drinks! 37th over: England 147-1 (Leach 72, Roy 62) A drop!! Easy! Leach pushes and the ball flies into Wilson\u2019s gloves behind the stumps, and then out again. If anything, he dived a little too far and somehow in the depths of the huge gloves it all goes wrong. Next ball Leach nervously wafts at a short ball from the disgruntled Rankin with only one hand on the bat. But somehow, he survives the over. 36th over: England 146-1 (Leach 72, Roy 61) Leach square-drives a tasty drive for four off Adair. Easy pickings. It is now 36 degrees out there and Michel Atherton mentions that a nightwatchman has never made a century for England. Four nineties from Alex Tudor, Harold Larwood, Eddie Hemmings and Jack Russell. And an apolitical comment on Theresa May from Romeo: Tanya, in that last shot on TV of May, Gauke and Clark, the man to the left as we look is Simon Coveney, deputy prime minister of Ireland. He\u2019s there with his 100-year-old-grandmother, who asked for a ticket to the match for her birthday. All the Ireland team signed a bat for her. Well that\u2019s a truly happy story in turbulent times. I hope Granny is being well-refreshed. 35th over: England 141-1 (Leach 68, Roy 60) Big Boyd Rankin, who is wearing an old-fashioned digital watch, wipes the sweat from his chin as Adair at leg slip gets just a finger to a flick from Leach and the ball bounces down to the boundary for four. Leach now has his highest first-class score! 34th over: England 135-1 (Leach 64, Roy 60) Adair throws down a couple of balls, and the umpires examine the scarlet globe again. Still no joy for Ireland and Roy nudges a couple down to third man. Then a cracking lbw shout from Adair, a booming inswinger that knocks Roy on the front pad. But it is swinging too far and the umpire shakes his head. An immaculate forward defensive is Roy\u2019s reply. 33rd over: England 133-1 (Leach 64, Roy 58) Ireland have had enough of the innocuous looking Leach. They call for the helmet, and short leg creeps in. Leach, with a shrug, gets an inside edge past the keeper for another four. 32nd over: England 129-1 (Leach 60, Roy 58) Adair roars an lbw appeal against Roy - Ireland decide not to review because they think Roy got an edge onto his pads. Ultra-edge agrees. One last mention of politics for now, from Karen in eastern Europe. \u201cHi Tanya,Following you from a sweltering Slovenia.Enjoying my only way of following the cricket which stands well poised. I\u2019m very much hoping the \u201cGaukeward Squad\u201d are plotting a coup. We desperately need one. What better place to hatch one than the revered Lords ground?\u201d I agree it is the perfect place for intrigue. There must have been many a plot thickened in St John\u2019s Wood, it is after all the establishment playground. 31st over: England 126-1 (Leach 60, Roy 56) Rankin, who I think is wearing a clean shirt, runs in over the wicket to Roy who fidgets and wriggles. England move into the lead with a whip off his legs - that\u2019s the hundred partnership too. Roy is beaten by Rankin\u2019s last ball, one that swerves away last minute. The temperature moves up to 36.2 degrees. Technical question: can anyone tell me how to copy and paste a link from the new-look Twitter? And Leach and Roy, sensibly long-sleeved, walk out with scores level. The pavilion doesn\u2019t look very full, but I think that is probably because members are hiding in the shade of the long room. Just reading through all the tweets and messages over some olives and salad and a solid old-fashioned roll/barm-cake/butty. There seems to be an unbridgeable divide between those who want politics nowhere near the quiet relief that is cricket and others who like a bit of intrigue with their Jason Roy - we\u2019ll call it 48:52. From David Stanley: I\u2019m no fan of Theresa May, but there\u2019s something about the image (21 over) which made her go up in my estimations. I\u2019m not sure whether it is the fact she\u2019s at the cricket immediately after resigning, the fact she\u2019s drinking from the largest glass of wine she can hold in one hand, or the fact you can almost hear her thinking: \u201cGood luck with Boris then, you bunch of clowns\u201d. I like to think she bought the seats either side of her too, just so she didn\u2019t have to sit next to anyone. To Jason Ali: \u201cCan we cut the politics, please? I love cricket because it is effectively pointless. Importantly, though, it takes me, and millions like me, away from the silliness that the real world is. Let\u2019s get back to the stats, impending weather, buses passing by the ground, Boycott\u2019s and Bumble\u2019s most recent utterances etc.\u201d Via Si Williams who dredged up some vintage Matthew Engel from the vaults: I\u2019ll try to plot a path through the thicket, though I having a feeling it won\u2019t be easy... 30th over: England 122-1 (Leach 60, Roy 52) Adair\u2019s suncream has somehow survived the scorch of the morning, splodged over his face like two pantomime slapped cheeks. A well-earned maiden finishes off his spell and that really is lunch. Scores are level. And where ten wickets fell yesterday morning, only one has gone today. The England batsmen are applauded into the pavilion by shirt-sleeved members and a hot looking balcony of fellow players. England\u2019s morning, with maiden Test fifties of differing styles for both Roy and Leach. Time for me to grab a quick glass of water, and the Irish bowlers to lie down in darkened room. See you in forty minutes! 29th over: England 122-1 (Leach 60, Roy 52) Roy drives sweetly for a couple , then wristily, powerfully, through point for a first Test fifty. He raises his bat to the dressing room. My helpful school-holiday side kick tells me that James Taylor mouthed to Ed Smith \u201c47 balls.\u201d Scores level. 28th over: England 115-1 (Leach 59, Roy 46) Jack Leach has impressive sang-froid. Not the most glamorous, nor the most stylish, and batting opposite one of the most destructive cricketers in the world, he chops McBrine for three without a care and the numbers build. At this rate, England will be evens by lunch. They currently trail by seven. Ah, Matt Hill has the answer to Labour\u2019s biggest cricket fan. \u201cIt was Clem Attlee (over 21). He is said to have refused to have a ticker-tape news machine in No. 10 until he was told it would contain live cricket scores. When it reported on the resignation of Nye Bevan, Attlee reportedly asked: \u201cWhy is my cricket machine leaking Cabinet secrets?\u201d 27th over: England 109-1 (Leach 56, Roy 43) Thompson again, I\u2019m feeling for the bowlers out there, it is hot enough sitting still with a lap top on my knee. Roy and Leach play carefully for lunch, nudge, nudge. Thank you to Robert Wright for this fascinating bit of insider political knowledge: \u201cThis is a boring, political nerd point but one that strikes me because I\u2019ve been working in parliament reporting on this week\u2019s momentous events. The Theresa May picture could be of genuine political significance because of the other people in the picture. The person in the middle of the row behind is David Gauke, who was until yesterday justice secretary, and who has given his name to the \u201cGaukeward squad\u201d of disaffected departed cabinet ministers who are expected to agitate against a no-deal Brexit. On the left of the picture is Greg Clark, another Remainer-ish MP who was forced out of the Cabinet yesterday. There has been speculation about whether Mrs May might join the Gaukeward squad. The picture suggests that, for cricket-watching purposes at least, she\u2019s already in.\u201d 26th over: England 106-1 (Leach 55, Roy 41) McBrine gets the honour of the last over before lunch. Roy dispatches a top-edged sweep for four and that isn\u2019t lunch actually. England are suddenly only 16 runs behind and the pendulum has swung. 25th over: England 99-1 (Leach 55, Roy 34) Roy is hit on the back pad and there\u2019s a huge appeal by Thompson. The Irish players look at each other, scratch their chins and run out of time. A sharp drive over the top of a leaping extra-cover for four follows, and Roy moves crisply on, out-scored by his nightwatchman but looking in ominously sharp form. Simon McMahon has the right idea: \u201cMorning Tanya. As the mercury pushes up towards 40 degrees in London, it\u2019s a pleasant 24\u00b0C here on the east coast of Scotland, and I\u2019m imagining being at Lord\u2019s by opening a bottle of champagne in my garden and following the OBO. If I half close my eyes, it\u2019s like I\u2019m there, honest. Although I don\u2019t think they have a washing line in the middle of the outfield at Lord\u2019s, do they?\u201d I love, 24 degrees. The optimum temperature. Summer dress with a cardie on hand. 24th over: England 94-1 (Leach 55, Roy 29) Leach charges down the wicket, twinkle-toed and lofts McBrine over midwicket for four. With a bounce it is over the rope. Glorious! 21st over: England 71-1 (Leach 43, Roy 18) Stuart Thompson gets the ball for the first time this morning and starts off on his long run. His Thursday wasn\u2019t as good as some others, he left a juicy straight one and was bowled for a duck. But that was yesterday, and today starts with five dots then a shot of some glorious genius from Jack Leach for four. Here is Theresa May at Lord\u2019s . I\u2019m pretty sure John Major headed to The Oval to watch Surrey after handing in his resignation to the Queen. But has any Labour former PM turned to cricket for immediate solace? 23rd over: England 89-1 (Leach 51, Roy 28) Many apologies, for some reason the last two overs of OBO have completely disappeared in a rather major technical hitch. Leach and Roy are still here - Roy has whalloped a six. Leach\u2019s goes to his maiden fifty with an edge off Thompson through second slip! And with it he becomes the first fifty for an England bespectacled batsman since Paul Allott 20th over: England 71-1 (Leach 43, Roy 18) A hot looking Murtagh rolls through the paces for his eighth over of this hot, hot day. Just a couple for Roy from a leg-side punch - though he would have had more had a hearty drive not charged straight into the non-striker\u2019s stumps. We see James Taylor and Ed Smith in matching ironed blue shirts, in the shade, pondering their moves for next week. And that\u2019s drinks. But while we swelter, the rest of Europe swelters even more. David Harland is continental Europe where he smells a conspiracy theory in a heat haze. I am currently enjoying the OBO as my only way to connect with this increasingly perverse test match whilst enduring sweltering heat in Switzerland for work. Am I alone in thinking the the powers at be at Lords must form part of a plot to enable the ECB to say to all the 4 day test naysayers that this Test format was a good idea after? In preparing a wicket that sees 20 Test wickets in a single day they must at least be trying to do someone a favour. Obviously the same person the English batsmen all owe money too as well.... 19th over: England 69-1 (Leach 43, Roy 16) Jack Leach reaches up to his tip-toe height and plays a perfect high-elbowed defensive prod to Boyd Rankin. Geoffrey would be proud. He potters back down the pitch to prod again at whatever it is he prods at. A maiden. Half an hour to lunch. 18th over: England 68-1 (Leach 43, Roy 16) Just one from Murtagh\u2019s over. Paul Frangi is experiencing heat-induced time travel:\u201dGood grief, Tom Stobbs has just given me horrible flashbacks from the 1993 Ashes series. Lathwell was like a rabbit in the headlights.\u201d Having just read Rob Smyth\u2019s (excellent) book on Robin Smith, and the kind of environment Test cricket was played in, I can\u2019t imagine the dressing-room was any place for introverts. Poor Lathwell, I like to hope anyone like him would have a better time now. 17th over: England 67-1 (Leach 42, Roy 16) Rankin charges in in the broiling heat. Jack Leach, lumpy side (?) guard bulking out his whites like a hidden library book, drives the first ball and they come through for a quick two. Some welcome quiet then Avitaj Mitra has been pondering results: Afternoon Tanya I have been thinking.. victory for Ireland is for the greater good of Test cricket (also it\u2019s gonna be a great story.. how the Irish brought the World Champions crashing down to earth..)Victory for England means a confidence booster before the Aussies stride into town next week.A conundrum, if ever there was one. A happy conundrum I reckon. 16th over: England 65-1 (Leach 40, Roy 16) Roy steps largely down the pitch, misses the ball and might have been stumped had Wilson been standing up. Then he is beaten by a Murtagh beauty with a wobble seam. But light relief off the last ball, an uppish cover-drive for four. 15th over: England 61-1 (Leach 40, Roy 12) Roy edges Rankin through the slips for four. An awkward shot, he tries to whallop through mid-wicket but ends up edging through third man. Breathe man, breathe! Rankin nips back through Leach\u2019s defences and just over the stumps Theresa May is apparently at Lord\u2019s today, with selected members of her recently-culled cabinet. Ronald Grover writes: \u201cTanya, how about cabinets as international sides? Theresa May\u2019s probably a mid-80s New Zealand? The current one a rebel tour to South Africa? It\u2019s all too depressing, I know\u201d 14th over: England 56-1 (Leach 40, Roy 8) Things are getting tricky, so Ireland go back to Murtagh and relentless accuracy. Leach hammers down on the pitch with his bat, tap, tap, but he just nurdles two off the over. Tom Stobbs has been studying bats with a detailed eye: \u201cGreat to see Jack Leach has solved the opener dilemna, but even better to see a Millichamp &amp; Hall bat in test cricket. Reminds me of Mark Lathwell.\u201d 13th over: England 54-1 (Leach 38, Roy 8) Jack Leach hadn\u2019t reached double figures in first-class cricket this season. But he hits Rankin for two successive fours - a little drive that just scampers away from the chasing fielders and bombastic drive through the covers. Ireland appeal to the umpires for a misshapen ball: they consider it, but no cigar. My my, and another, this time Leach tips Rankin off his hip for four more. Mark White in Sydney says the secret words: \u201cCan I be the 500th person to say England has found its ideal second opener - Leach! You\u2019re welcome.\u201d 12th over: England 41-1 (Leach 25, Roy 8) Adair continues from the pavilion end. Oh and that\u2019s a beautiful shot through extra-cover from Jack Leach for four. And with a replica shot, though not quite as well-timed, he moves on to the highest England score in the match. Roy is off the mark with a click and a slightly off-centre off-drive for four. He has another throw of the bat next ball - this feels slightly too hasty. Having said that, he strokes a perfect, gorgeous cover drive off the last ball of the over. Fifteen from it. Sam Collier writes from the Shetlands: \u201cRe Tom\u2019s comment at 10:52, I was going to email yesterday about how Ollie Stone\u2019s picture on Cricinfo makes him look like three of the Inbetweeners, rolled disturbingly into one. I cannot now unsee it.\u201d 11th over: England 26-1 (Leach 18, Roy 0) England had done the hard stuff, seen off Murtagh after forty minutes of disciplined, accurate 70-something mphers. Boyd Rankin replaced him at the nursery end, bounced Leach, was cut for four before suckering Burns into his trap. Roy walks out to two slips a gully and a short leg. Oh and they took drinks as the wicket fell. The change of bowling works! Burns\u2019s 26 ball mini marathon is finished when he pushes forward awkwardly, feathers an edge and is caught behind 10th over: England 21-0 (Leach 13, Burns 6) This is attritional . England are rightfully wary, and Ireland aren\u2019t giving them anything to play with. Burns pushes and prods and is beaten outside off stump by a beauty of an Adair outswinger. Another maiden. Shankar Mony is in mischievous mood. \u201cNow that Leach has reached 11, is it right to point out that he has a better average as opener than Roy?\u201d 9th over: England 21-0 (Leach 13, Burns 6) Murtagh wipes his forehead with his forearm as the mercury creeps up to 33 degrees. I spot parasols and fans in the crowd - a sign of this new climate reality. Leach wriggles and shuffles his way through five balls of the over much to the frustration of Ireland. Burns picks up three through square leg. 8th over: England 18-0 (Leach 13, Burns 3) As a long-time glasses wearer , I feel an immediate affinity with cricketers in specs. After Imam ul Haq in the World Cup, now Jack Leach. The urge to put his hand inside his helmet and readjust those specs must be so strong. Especially on a sweaty day. I\u2019m in awe. Adair runs in with four slips. Leach grabs two with a drive and nearly gets yorked from the final ball of the over. David Hopkins has a bone to pick: \u201c I can\u2019t help but think Brian Withington is being a bit unfair on the honourable member for the 18th century. It\u2019s not that he considers Ireland to be beyond the pale - I understand he\u2019s perfectly happy to sequester his funds there ahead of the impending Brexit crash he\u2019s happy to impose on the rest of us for example.\u201d 7th over: England 15-0 (Leach 11, Burns 3) I\u2019m guessing that the bowlers won\u2019t have long spells today so Burns and Leach probably only have another 15 minutes max before Murtagh retires to pasture. Burns fiddles with his gloves as they flash up his stats - a Test average of 34, two fifties and a hundred. A first-class average of 42. He warily plays out a Murtagh maiden. Two in a row. Careful England. 6th over: England 15-0 (Leach 11, Burns 3) Adair runs in, and Leach prods, defends, avoids. A maiden. Something is bothering Phil Whithall: During Adair\u2019s last over I noticed that third and fourth slip switched places for the last delivery. It was a very rushed, almost panicked movement, that struck me as odd. I\u2019m struggling to recall seeing this happen before. Can you enlighten me? Phil, I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t notice, I must have been glancing at the screen. I can\u2019t think of any particular reason. Maybe other OBO readers can help? 5th over: England 15-0 (Leach 11, Burns 3) Overthrows in England\u2019s favour , again, gets the score jogging along. Leach and Burns go through for a quick single, there is a shy at the stumps, it hits, but the ball riccochets off and runs down to the boundary. Other than that, we have line and length, line and length from Murtagh. 4th over: England 9-0 (Leach 6, Burns 2) Adair finds some swing in the humid Lord\u2019s air. He\u2019s too good for Leach, who shuffles left to right to try to combat the movement. Brian Withington writes: \u201cTry as I might, I have been unable to unearth a tweet from Jacob Rees-Mogg linking yesterday\u2019s cricket with Brexit developments. Perhaps he was otherwise engaged. Or maybe anything involving Ireland is just \u2018beyond the pale\u2019 for a politician who might have regarded the potato famine as a regrettable but unavoidable local difficulty?\u201d Brian, I\u2019m afraid that JRM was probably too busy after being promoted to Lord President of the Council and Leader of the House of Commons in Boris Johnson\u2019s new government. There are no words. 3rd over: England 6-0 (Leach 4, Burns 2) It\u2019s the main man. Tim Murtagh rubs his chest and sighs the sigh of a man in the golden autumn of his career. Leach is watchful, glasses visible through the grill. He is beaten by a 71mph-er and then squeezes a four between third slip and gully in an utterly unconvincing way. 2nd over: England 2-0 (Leach 0, Burns 2) Rory Burns plays no stroke at the first ball of the day from Mark Adair, then goes down the pitch to prod a patch of unruly carpet. Adair\u2019s face is blazed with suncream and the thermometer reads 32 degrees. I\u2019m actually grateful to be in the shade of the house. Burns is off the mark with a nudge off the hip. Mark Slater has a conspiracy theory. \u201cWas [yesterday] part of a cunning plan to persuade Australia to open the bowling with their part time trundlers instead of the 90mph+ merchants...?\u201d And the players are on their way out. It\u2019s boiling hot and the pitch looks much drier than yesterday. Can England still be there by sandwiches? Ah Nasser - still my favourite ever England captain. He\u2019s out on the pitch demonstrating in a crisp shirt where England\u2019s batsmen went wrong yesterday. \u201cTechnically England were very very poor against the moving ball. Many modern-day cricketers go too hard against the moving ball. Why would anyone listen to Nasser Hussain? An old has-been? I say listen to Virat Kohli and Kane Williamson who have learnt how to deal with it.\u201d Wondering if the magic will be with Tim Murtagh today? Tom vdGucht was, though he admits to being somewhat bewitched by Olly Stone. Although it seems quite perverse to think about any other bowler other than Dial M for Murtagh, what did you make of Olly Stone on his debut? The only slight reservation I have with him, following seeing him in the flesh first the first time yesterday, is how much he resembles Jay from the Inbetweeners. I\u2019m pretty sure fearsome fast bowlers shouldn\u2019t be able to get work as part-time lookalikes of comedy characters, unless that character happens to be Viv from The Young Ones... I thought Stone did all that could have been asked of him yesterday - occasionally hitting 90mph with a box of tricks up his sleeve. I\u2019m ashamed to admit, though, that I\u2019ve never watched the Inbetweeners, but I feel like lots of fast bowlers are cartoon versions of someone: Merv Hughes, Shoaib Akhtar, even Bob Willis must resemble some dystopian figure from somewhere. Vic Lanser writes with news from THE OTHER PLACE. But as it is so good, I think we can quietly reprint it. Tanya, I loved this comment on Cricinfo: Chris Crighton: \u201cSo England won the toss, elected to bat, and eight hours later their openers were 0-0 at the close. All of Geoffrey Boycott\u2019s dreams have finally come true.\u201d David Gower is wearing a panama! David Lloyd was not impressed by England yesterday. \u201cEngland played in front of their bodies to a bowler who is deadly accurate and bowling at 78mph. The top three is still a huge problem.\u201d And thanks to James Hurle - here is the TMS link for overseas listeners. I\u2019m trying to work out if ICC have any specific guidelines on heat in Test matches -meanwhile, some reading on the heat effects of cricket helmets and a study on the effects of extreme heat on Elite Australian players. With the mercury due to touch 39 degrees today at Lord\u2019s - playing and watching is likely to be an extremely uncomfortable experience. The MCC have made contingency measures for spectators - air-conditioned rooms, plenty of water, no jackets for members. But for players, things are more unclear . Joe Root was hospitalized during the last Ashes Test at Sydney, when the temperature reached 47.3C. Cricket Australia has strict guidelines on heat, and uses the Wet Bulb Global Temperature Index. The ECB do not, yet, as far as I can discover, but last year the MCC cricket committee agreed that umpires should be able to stop play because of heat. This is the law umpires could use: Law 2.7.1 It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either conditions of ground, weather or light or exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous o runreasonable for play to take place.Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal.The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as unreasonable or dangerous. Good morning everyone and welcome to the morning after the day before after the week before. Twenty wickets fell in yesterday\u2019s ding-dong day - with England out before lunch and batting again just before the close. What craziness! Were England caught napping? Were their heads in a fifty-over space? Were they just caught out by the relentless accuracy of Tim Murtagh on an emerald green carpet? We shall see as the morning develops. Here is Vic\u2019s match report for starters:",

      "bodyText": "Independent candidate Oliver Yates has confirmed he will challenge Liberal party Chinese language signs, designed to resemble Australian Electoral Commission material, in the court of disputed returns. Yates \u2013 who unsuccessfully contested the seat of Kooyong against treasurer Josh Frydenberg \u2013 told Guardian Australia he will lodge a challenge before the 40-day deadline after the return of writs, set to expire on 31 July. The signs used the purple and white AEC colours and told voters \u201cthe correct voting method\u201d was to put a \u201c1\u201d next to the Liberal candidate and then number the rest of the boxes from lowest to highest. Fine print at the bottom of the signs said they were authorised by acting state director Simon Frost for the Liberal party\u2019s Victorian division. Yates believes the signs infringe the Electoral Act, which bans material that is \u201clikely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote\u201d. However, because Yates can only challenge the result in Kooyong and not in the electorate of Chisholm, where the signs also featured, the case is more likely to serve as a test case for misleading electoral information than to disturb the results. In Kooyong, Frydenberg comfortably won with 55.7% of the two-party preferred vote. In Chisholm, Liberal candidate Gladys Liu won with a primary vote of 43%, defeating Labor\u2019s Jennifer Yang by just 1,090 votes, or 0.57% of the two-party preferred vote. Guardian Australia understands that Labor, despite raising similar concerns, is unlikely to challenge the result in Chisholm. The Australian Electoral Commission inspected the signs on election day and concluded they were authorised. It said there were no rules regarding the use of colour in campaign signage. Yates said he will submit a petition to the court of disputed returns \u201con behalf of many Kooyong constituents who were appalled by these signs, including many in the Chinese community\u201d. \u201cThese signs were intended to appear as a directive from the AEC to Mandarin speakers, notwithstanding the tiny Liberal party authorisation at the bottom, quite perversely only in English,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were clearly designed to deceive voters in how to mark their ballot papers or in other words, how to cast their votes. \u201cIf these signs and the people that approved them are not considered misleading and deceptive, then basically there is no limit on deceptive and misleading conduct at all.\u201d Yates said that major parties \u201cclaim they can say whatever they like during an election\u201d based on a high court precedent limiting the definition of misleading and deceptive conduct to acts affecting the process of filling in a ballot paper, not influencing how voters formed their decision. Yates questioned whether that was \u201cthe court\u2019s intention\u201d, arguing it would lead to politics being \u201cthe only industry where misleading and deceptive behaviour is considered a necessary and positive skill set\u201d. Frost said: \u201cAll election material was properly authorised as required by the Commonwealth Electoral Act.\u201d On election day Liu told Sky News they were \u201cgood signs\u201d and defended their use. \u201cThe sign has been approved and authorised by the state director of the Liberal party,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that this is a good sign to have to inform people to vote.\u201d Yates also complained that he had been attacked \u201cthrough fake web sites and dirt mail that I was untrustworthy and in bed with the coal industry or that another Kooyong candidate may have supported female genital mutilation\u201d. In recent times Labor\u2019s claims that the Liberals would privatise Medicare in the 2016 election and Liberal claims that Labor planned to introduce a death tax or tax non-electric vehicles in the 2019 election have prompted calls for truth in political advertising laws. The federal government introduced truth in political advertising laws in 1983, but they were described as unworkable and dumped a year later. After the 2019 election former Labor frontbencher Ed Husic suggested an \u201carmistice\u201d between the parties to prevent a proliferation of fake news claims.",

Marape made the comments on Thursday in an address to the Lowy Institute as part of his official visit to Australia. \u201cWe welcome every support Australia can give, but in 10 years\u2019 time I want to assist Australia helping the rest of the Pacific,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be participating with Australia looking after smaller island nations.\u201d In 2019-20, Australia will give an estimated $607.5m to PNG in development assistance.

The decision ultimately cost the country an estimated $420m after PNG had to sell its 10% stake in the company amid a commodity prices slump. The ombudsman found O\u2019Neill, then prime minister, to have engaged in multiple acts which were \u201cwrong and improper\u201d, including failing to present the loan proposal to parliament as required by the PNG constitution.

It is located 12km from Onslow on the Pilbara north-west coast. A requirement that some of the emissions from the project be offset was dropped by the former Liberal state government, and in March the current Labor state government rejected guidelines from the Environmental Protection Agency requiring major LNG projects to be carbon neutral. The relocation of animals began when the project was approved in 2011 and continued until August last year, after the first shipment of LNG. Relocating terrestrial fauna was not part of the environmental conditions placed on the project, which largely concerned impact on seagrass beds and federally-listed marine species such as dugongs and sawfish. \u201cThe first thing companies try to do is cut costs, and environment is one of the areas where they try to cut costs,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThis company went above and beyond what they had to do [and] had exceptional outcomes.\u201d They focused on microfauna, on the assumption that larger animals, such as kangaroos and wallabies, would move themselves.

Not only has 2019 brought the world it\u2019s hottest ever June, but in recent days countries from Belgium to the Netherlands to Germany have broken their all-time heat records.

The kind of weather pattern delivering today\u2019s hot air, a jetstream that is deflected unusually far north and drawing hot air from the south, is not itself caused by global warming. Indeed the famous 1976 heatwave was a result of similar meteorological conditions. </em></p> <p><em>What is different now is that the global temperature is about 1 degree Celsius hotter than in 1976, meaning that when these unusual weather patterns occur, the heatwave is guaranteed to be more severe. Met Office scientists found that the 2018 summer heatwave \u2013 which delivered the UK\u2019s joint-hottest summer on record \u2013 was 30 times more likely because of global warming. Although we cannot say for sure that global warming caused this week\u2019s extreme temperatures, climate change is without doubt \u2018loading the dice\u2019 and making heatwaves much more likely and much more severe.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d39b7498f0845f89e314381\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T14:17:24.327Z\">3.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Police were called to an outdoor swimming pool in south London after a group reportedly tried to force their way to Brockwell Lido this afternoon.</p> <p>The Metropolitan Police said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Police were called to Brockwell Lido to reports of overcrowding.

With the track temperature rising to around 20 C higher than the air temperature in strong sunlight, expansion of the metal is to be expected. </em></p> <p><em>In most of the network individual pieces of rail are welded together to form longer continuous sections; where this is the case the rails are stretched before welding to reduce the chance of buckling occurring as the track is heated, although the amount of tension is set based on the temperature ranges that we\u2019d normally expect to see in the UK (up to about 30 C).</em></p> <p><em>More tension could be put into the rails to allow for greater expansion at higher temperatures, however this could mean using slightly different steel grades which would probably cost more and it would almost certainly increase the risk of rail breaks - it\u2019s all a bit of a balancing act. </em></p> <p><em>Where temperatures become unusually high, the only solution is to slow the trains down to reduce the impact the tracks. Track temperature is monitored, and forecasting models are used to predict when (and if) the risk of high rail temperatures is significant enough for speed restrictions to be put in place.</em></p> <p><em>In critical areas, such as the switch and crossings near stations, the insides of the rails are painted white to reflect the sun\u2019s heat. This can reduce the track temperature by 5\u00b0C and reduces signalling failures which lead to significant disruption. This technique is also used In countries where high temperatures are more commonplace, such as Italy, where engineers often paint the inside faces of the rails white to reflect the sunlight and lower the risk of buckling.</em></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d39b0a08f08cf92bb776d70\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T13:42:47.859Z\">2.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Friends of the Earth has urged the new prime minister <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> to take action on the climate crisis. </p> <p>As well as cutting emissions, the campaign group is calling for doubled tree cover in order to protect people from the impact of extreme weather and help absorb carbon from the atmosphere.</p> <p>Urban green space in <strong>England</strong> has declined by 7% in recent years, according to FOE.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from us for this evening. Here\u2019s a summary of the day\u2019s developments: Records were broken again for the second day running, with Paris recording its hottest day ever. The extreme temperatures follow a similar heatwave last month that made it the hottest June on record. Experts at the Met Office say the current weather pattern is driving hot air from the south, but there is \u201cno doubt\u201d climate change is playing a role. Scientists have warned that the climate crisis is making summer heatwaves five times more likely and significantly more intense. The UK has seen its hottest July day and second hottest day on record as the mercury hit 38.1C, the Met Office said. The sweltering heat sparked travel chaos across the UK, with many operators urging passengers not to travel as services are delayed and cancelled. A yellow warning for thunderstorms has been issued for most of England except the South West, and parts of Scotland until 4am on Friday. Two young adults and a child had to be rescued from the sea off Lincolnshire after drifting away from the shore on inflatables. Skegness RNLI launched the lifeboat off the town\u2019s busy central beach to rescue two people on a small inflatable dingy, some 600 metres from the shore. Once the lifeboat arrived alongside the dinghy the passengers were visibly shaken and suffering from early signs of shock. As the volunteer crew were returning to the lifeboat station at Skegness, they had to rescue a young boy on another inflatable, 200 metres offshore. He was unaware of his situation and taken back to his parents at the water\u2019s edge. Adam Holmes, volunteer press officer for Skegness RNLI said: This is another serious incident involving inflatables on our stretch of coast, something we\u2019ve seen rise rapidly in recent months. It\u2019s an alarming trend and we\u2019re trying hard to reduce this through education and safety messages. Inflatable rings, lilos and dinghies are simply not safe or suitable for use in the sea, even with the best of intentions, the risks are just not worth the consequences \u2013 leave them at home. Temperature records in France, Belgium, and Germany have been broken for the second time in 24 hours The Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent, Jon Henley, reports that the mercury at Paris-Montsouris station in the French capital surpassed the previous high of 40.4C, set in July 1947, soon after 1pm and continued to climb, reaching 42.6C soon after 4pm. The temperature at Kleine Brogel near the Dutch border rose on Thursday to 40.6C, breaking the record set the day before. Germany\u2019s national DWD weather service said it measured 41.5C in the north-western town of Lingen on Thursday. It came a day after an all-time national high of 40.5C was recorded in Geilenkirchen in North Rhine-Westphalia. SEA LIFE Blackpool has had to cool the sea water for the first time in 30 years Aquarists at SEA LIFE Blackpool are having to run the water through a cooler because it\u2019s too warm. The aquarium, which leads a \u2018breed, rescue, protect\u2019 campaign, supports rare and endangered creatures, such as sharks, stingrays, seahorses and turtles. Matthew Titherington, general manager of SEA LIFE Blackpool, said: \u201cWe draw water for the displays directly from the Irish Sea, which is just across the Promenade. Sometimes we have to heat it slightly to get the right temperature, especially in winter. \u201cWe\u2019ve never before had to cool it. It\u2019s really important that the water we draw is at exactly the right temperature when it enters the displays.\u201d Commuters have been warned to not travel as soaring temperatures cause disruption to some services. The rising temperatures caused damage to overhead electric wires between London St Pancras and Luton, blocking all lines. East Midlands Trains urged passengers to not travel and warned it had been unable to secure ticket acceptance via alternative routes. Thameslink said \u201cyou are strongly advised not to travel\u201d, and said journey times will be extended by up to 90 minutes. London North Eastern Railway have also told passengers to not travel today and to defer their travel. The blistering temperatures also damaged overhead electric wires between London Euston and Watford Junction, disrupting Virgin Trains services. A spokeswoman for the operator said: \u201cDue to extensive disruption on the network today, any Virgin Trains customers who would prefer to postpone their travel can use their tickets on Virgin Trains services tomorrow.\u201d Nick King, network services director at Network Rail, said: We have a number of heat-related incidents across the rail network this evening that are causing disruption to services. We are sorry that some passengers are experiencing uncomfortable conditions and inconvenience. Our teams are working flat out to fix the issues as quickly as possible and get people on the move. We\u2019re asking anyone travelling this evening to check with their train operators or visit the National Rail Enquiries website to see how their journey is affected. Edinburgh is currently experiencing its warmest day on record, STV reports. Temperatures have soared to 31.2C, surpassing the city\u2019s previous record of 30C set in 1975. In Cambridge, temperatures reached 38.1 \u00b0C. This is the second time temperatures reached over 100 Fahrenheit in the UK, according to the Met Office. Animal welfare campaigners are calling for greyhound races to be cancelled as temperatures soar across the UK. The League Against Cruel Sports warned the the greyhounds, who will be transported from their kennels and then raced at the tracks, are at risk of heatstroke. Five of the six greyhound races due to take place on Thursday have been cancelled, but racing went ahead at Sunderland. Racing is expected to take place at Yarmouth, Hove, Newcastle and Monmore this evening. Nick Weston, head of campaigns at the League Against Cruel Sports, said: \u201cThere have already been reports of dogs dying after just being walked in this heat, let alone racing. These races still going ahead despite the soaring temperatures is yet another clear example of how greyhound welfare is out far behind profit, and why this \u2018sport\u2019 needs to end in the UK.\u201d Good afternoon, I\u2019m Aamna Mohdin taking over from Mattha Busby. The Met Office have just confirmed that today is the second hottest day on record. A temperature of 37.7C has been recorded at Kew Gardens, in London, and Writtle, Essex, surpassing the previous second highest record of 37.1C set on August 3 1990. Grant Allen, a professor of atmospheric physics at the University of Manchester, said that while no single weather event can ever be linked directly to climate change, a statistically-significant trend is climate change by definition: This trend is very clearly what we are now seeing and scientific papers published yesterday which were widely reported in the media, confirm this. Climate change is no longer a future problem, it is here and it is accelerating. As climate change progresses, the frequency of previously extreme weather events will increase. There will be a new normal, which will challenge existing UK infrastructure and profoundly impact our ecosystem. Dr Michael Byrne, a lecturer at St Andrews, has been asked how significant is it if today becomes the hottest day on record in the UK. Hugely significant, yet just the latest in a torrent of temperature records to be broken in the last month. Not only has 2019 brought the world it\u2019s hottest ever June, but in recent days countries from Belgium to the Netherlands to Germany have broken their all-time heat records. It has never been hotter in northern Europe. Such extreme heat poses serious health risks this week as well as uncomfortable questions about how well the UK is preparing for increasingly frequent and severe heatwaves over coming decades. On whether the weather has clearly been caused by man-made global warming? It is impossible to say whether individual events \u2013 such as this week\u2019s heatwave \u2013 are caused by man-made global warming. The kind of weather pattern delivering today\u2019s hot air, a jetstream that is deflected unusually far north and drawing hot air from the south, is not itself caused by global warming. Indeed the famous 1976 heatwave was a result of similar meteorological conditions. What is different now is that the global temperature is about 1 degree Celsius hotter than in 1976, meaning that when these unusual weather patterns occur, the heatwave is guaranteed to be more severe. Met Office scientists found that the 2018 summer heatwave \u2013 which delivered the UK\u2019s joint-hottest summer on record \u2013 was 30 times more likely because of global warming. Although we cannot say for sure that global warming caused this week\u2019s extreme temperatures, climate change is without doubt \u2018loading the dice\u2019 and making heatwaves much more likely and much more severe. Police were called to an outdoor swimming pool in south London after a group reportedly tried to force their way to Brockwell Lido this afternoon. The Metropolitan Police said: Police were called to Brockwell Lido to reports of overcrowding. Officers attended. Security staff at the lido have closed the doors as a group of 500 people are trying to get in. The owners of the venue are advising people not to come as there is a three-hour waiting time. Elsewhere in London, Parliament Hill Lido refused people further entry just before noon due to overcrowding. According to the Press Association, police were repeatedly forced to attend the pool after fights broke out in the queue, although there were no arrests or any reported injuries. In the South West, Portishead Lido in Bristol also warned people of long queues. \u201cBe prepared for a long wait, and there\u2019s no shade,\u201d staff posted on Twitter. \u201cBring water, snacks, folding chairs, sunscreen, a hat and some patience &amp; humour.\u201d Lidos in Peterborough, London\u2019s Tooting Bec and at Hemsley in York also had to turn away prospective swimmers after reaching capacity. The northwestern town of Lingen, Bonn, has experienced a high of 40.9 C, the German Weather Service has said. \u201cIt\u2019s changing every minute,\u201d spokesman Andreas Friedrich said, adding that the new high, which followed the record 40.5 degrees measured in western Germany on Wednesday, would likely soon be exceeded. Wednesday\u2019s record was at 40.5 C in Geilenkirchen near the Belgian border, the German news agency DPA said. The hot weather is causing further disruption for travellers in the UK, with Manchester Metrolink the latest operator to put in place temporary speed restrictions across its network as speed limits on most commuters lines were cut from 60mph to 30mph. Speed restrictions have been in place in the south east since midday, and they will remain until 8pm, due to fears that tracks could buckle in the heat if trains travel too fast. Extreme weather action teams have been \u201cactivated\u201d to keep passengers safe and trains running, Network Rail said. Dr John Easton, rail expert at the Institution of Engineering and Technology, said: The main problem is that as the steel rails heat up, they expand like any other metal. The resulting extra rail length means that the track may begin to curve, a process known as \u2018buckling\u2019. With the track temperature rising to around 20 C higher than the air temperature in strong sunlight, expansion of the metal is to be expected. In most of the network individual pieces of rail are welded together to form longer continuous sections; where this is the case the rails are stretched before welding to reduce the chance of buckling occurring as the track is heated, although the amount of tension is set based on the temperature ranges that we\u2019d normally expect to see in the UK (up to about 30 C). More tension could be put into the rails to allow for greater expansion at higher temperatures, however this could mean using slightly different steel grades which would probably cost more and it would almost certainly increase the risk of rail breaks - it\u2019s all a bit of a balancing act. Where temperatures become unusually high, the only solution is to slow the trains down to reduce the impact the tracks. Track temperature is monitored, and forecasting models are used to predict when (and if) the risk of high rail temperatures is significant enough for speed restrictions to be put in place. In critical areas, such as the switch and crossings near stations, the insides of the rails are painted white to reflect the sun\u2019s heat. This can reduce the track temperature by 5\u00b0C and reduces signalling failures which lead to significant disruption. This technique is also used In countries where high temperatures are more commonplace, such as Italy, where engineers often paint the inside faces of the rails white to reflect the sunlight and lower the risk of buckling. Friends of the Earth has urged the new prime minister Boris Johnson to take action on the climate crisis. As well as cutting emissions, the campaign group is calling for doubled tree cover in order to protect people from the impact of extreme weather and help absorb carbon from the atmosphere. Urban green space in England has declined by 7% in recent years, according to FOE. It says that green spaces such as parks and woodland can reduce excessive heat and, in towns and cities, help regulate the \u2018urban heat island\u2019 effect. Emi Murphy, trees campaigner at Friends of the Earth, said: Having more trees in our towns and cities will lower temperatures, provide shade and absorb carbon emissions to help avert climate breakdown in the first place. Trees have huge benefits for people and the planet but current government work on tree planting is depressingly negligible. There\u2019s a serious risk of the temperatures that we currently define as extreme becoming the new norm. This goes way beyond what you could call a nice summer\u2019s day \u2013 if we see temperatures like this become a regular occurrence then more and more lives will be at risk. It\u2019s not just extreme heat that trees can help to defend us against, but also the heavy rainfall and floods that are a constant threat to many communities. Police in Devon have issued a warning to the public not to leave pets inside cars, after officers rescued a dog who was locked inside a vehicle for more than three hours. The RSPCA say on their website: Many people still believe that it\u2019s ok to leave a dog in a car on a warm day if the windows are left open or they\u2019re parked in the shade, but the truth is, it\u2019s still a very dangerous situation for the dog. A car can become as hot as an oven very quickly, even when it doesn\u2019t feel that warm. When it\u2019s 22 degrees, in a car it can reach an unbearable 47 degrees within the hour. In an emergency, we may not be able to attend quickly enough, and with no powers of entry, we\u2019d need police assistance at such an incident. Don\u2019t be afraid to dial 999, the police will inform us if animal welfare assistance is required. Currently, the highest temperatures across the country are 37.7 C at Kew Gardens, 37.6 C at Heathrow, and 37.1 C in Cambridge, with the mercury still rising. Sarah Kent, a meteorologist at the Met Office, said: We are still confident in the forecast we put out earlier today. There is a 60% chance of breaking the all-time UK record, which is 38.5 C at Faversham at the 10th August 2003, and we are still expecting temperatures to peak at around 39 degrees. Its a fine balance, as temperatures have climbed, they are also starting to trigger showers, with cloud suppressing the rise of temperatures. Its going to be a close run thing, and we are going to have to keep an eye on all our recording stations. The area most likely to see 39 C extends from London up towards south Lincolnshire, and through Cambridge. Reuters have the latest: Temperatures in the Netherlands reached a record high of 39.4 degrees Celsius (102.9 degrees Fahrenheit) on Thursday, breaking the record set a day earlier, Dutch meteorology institute KNMI said. The KNMI earlier announced a new record of 41.7 C, but moments later said the measurement was not credible. Temperatures were still rising after the measurement of 39.4 degrees, KNMI said. Until Wednesday, when temperatures peaked at 39.3 degrees, the Dutch national heat record had stood at 38.6 degrees since the summer of 1944. The Met Office has confirmed that the 36.9C temperature recorded at Heathrow Airport earlier is the new record temperature for July. Here\u2019s the latest on the searing heat in Paris, from the Guardian\u2019s Europe correspondent Jon Henley. Belgium has also seen temperatures surpass 40 C, according to officials who say it is the first time such heat has been experienced since records began in 1833. A temperature of 40.2 degrees was in Angleur, near Liege in the east of the country yesterday, the Belgian meteorological institute has confirmed. It had said earlier that the 39.9 C recorded in Kleine Brogel was the new national record, and the institute said the new record could well be broken again on Thursday. In the Netherlands, the national institute for public health and the environment has issued a \u201csmog alarm\u201d due to severe air pollution in parts of the country due to ozone in the air. The warning applies for regions including the densely populated cities of Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Air quality in some regions will be \u201cextremely bad\u201d because light winds mean that pollution is not being blown away and sunlight transforms it into ozone, the institute said. Smog can cause irritation of the eyes, nose and throat, and leave people coughing and short of breath, with the institute warning that children, the elderly, and those who already suffer from respiratory issues are particularly susceptible to harm, and should stay inside. Elsewhere, in Austria, authorities have said a 2-year-old boy has died of dehydration after he climbed into an overheated parked car on Monday without his family noticing, and then fell asleep inside it before passing away in hospital on Wednesday. Temperatures of almost 36C have been recorded in parts of England. Here are some photos from throughout the country. Plus, are seagulls in the UK getting more aggressive? Emine Saner reports. The Associated Press have this report: Paris has beaten its all-time heat record, hitting 40.6 C amid a heat wave breaking barriers across Europe. Authorities say the temperature is still rising. The national weather service Meteo France announced that the new record was reached on Thursday afternoon, beating the previous record of 40.4 C in 1947. It\u2019s one of several records set in this week\u2019s heat wave, the second wave baking the continent this summer. France saw its hottest-ever day on record last month, when a southern town reached 46C. Some retailers have increased the price of fans and portable air conditioners by up to 40% within a month, according to a comparison website. Vanessa Katsapa, country manager at PriceSpy UK, said: Seasonal products do tend to fluctuate in price in line with demand, but it\u2019s clear that retailers are cashing in as people struggle to stay cool With the price of fans and portable conditioners rising by up to 40% in the space of a month, a little research before purchasing could save shoppers from getting in a sweat. Elsewhere, the recently departed prime minister Theresa May is watching the cricket at Lords, where England are trailing Ireland \u2013 who are playing their first ever test match. You can follow the Guardian\u2019s live coverage here: Train passengers across the UK have been advised to avoid travelling if possible, with many services cancelled amid warnings that the rail system cannot cope with the searing heat, Rob Davies reports. Such is the heat, travellers have been taking their shirts off on trains. St John Ambulance service has offered advice to keep people safe in the sun, following the deaths of three people this week in the UK whose bodies were recovered from the water. Their volunteers will be out and about across the country, encouraging people to avoid dehydration and to take breaks from the sun where possible. Dr Lynn Thomas, medical director at the emergency service, said: Extreme heat can be very dangerous, particularly for the very young and old, and we would encourage everyone to check on their elderly relatives and neighbours and look after themselves this week by keeping out of the sun or covering up, wearing sunscreen and drinking plenty of water. Heat exhaustion and heatstroke are two of the most serious problems that can develop when the mercury soars but by being prepared you can spot the early warning signs, such as headache and dizziness. Knowing what action to take, could mean you might be the difference between life and death in an emergency in your community. The latest from across Europe. Extinction Rebellion is protesting against celebrative and \u201cirresponsible\u201d media reporting of the heatwave, with a demonstration planned outside the Sun newspaper in London later today. A spokesperson for the UK chapter of the environmental activists said: Are you feeling hot under the collar about the way the mainstream press is covering the climate crisis? Is it getting on your tits?? It is time to bare all with Extinction Rebellion to show the media that we can\u2019t bear more of this poor reporting. We want to see pictures that match how hot the climate is getting. And if you are in London, do come along to The Sun HQ in London and tell them that we won\u2019t stand for their cheek, by baring your own beautiful cheeks! Caspar Hughes, of Extinction Rebellion\u2019s \u2018Media Tell the Truth\u2019 group, said: The media needs to become the public service it was during the onset of World War II. We have 11 years to stop our children from inheriting a hellish planet. Without the media telling the truth, throughout the press, we will fail that test. A major water main has burst in Bristol, in the west of England, leaving thousands of people without water, the BBC reported. Bristol Water has said hot temperatures making the ground shift and leading pipes to contract and expand may have caused the burst, which has affected homes in a number of parts of the city. Vulnerable people are having bottled water delivered to them, and water tankers are being sent to the area. The company said on Twitter: \u201cWe\u2019re still working on getting this repaired as soon as possible. Some customers in the area might be seeing some discoloured water - this is due to the works nearby so we are sorry if you\u2019re being affected by this.\u201d The Trades Union Congress has urged bosses to allow flexible working and to keep workplaces cool so that staff can work more comfortably during hot weather. Although the law states that staff should work in a reasonable temperature, there is no precise legislation for minimum or maximum working temperatures and the TUC is calling for the introduction of a new legal maximum indoor temperature. This would be set at 30C, or 27C for those doing strenuous jobs, with employers obligated to put in place cooling measures when the workplace temperature hits 24C. TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady said: While many of us love to see the sun, it\u2019s no fun working in a baking office or a stifling factory. Bosses should do all they can to keep the temperature down. The easiest way for staff to keep cool inside is being able to work in more casual clothing. While shorts and vest tops may not be appropriate for all, nobody should be made to suffer in the heat for the sake of keeping up appearances. It\u2019s in bosses\u2019 interests to provide a cool and comfortable work environment. Workers who are unable to dress down in lighter clothing, or who work in offices without air-conditioning, fans or drinking water, are going to be tired, and lack inspiration and creativity.\u201d However, Kate Boguslawska, an employment solicitor at City law firm, Carter Lemon Camerons, has said such laws could be unworkable. While it is understandable that people might want to introduce upper limits to the temperatures employees can be required to work in, such rules seem unlikely to be workable in practice. There are a wide range of workplaces where employees must continue working, such as hospitals, prisons and much of the infrastructure sector. There are also many workplaces where high temperatures are unavoidable, such as factories, foundries or commercial kitchens. A Met Office study showed last year\u2019s summer heatwave was made around 30 times more likely than it would be under natural conditions, as a result of human activity driving global warming. Prof Peter Stott, from the Met Office, said: There\u2019s no doubt that climate change is playing a role here because of the elevated temperatures and that\u2019s related to the fact we\u2019ve got this weather pattern being drawn up from North Africa. Having this frequency of heatwaves across the hemisphere would have been extraordinarily unlikely without climate change, and it\u2019s now being made a possibility, and it\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. He added that the existing record temperature for the UK, of 38.5C, set in August 2003 in Faversham, Kent, was set in recent times when the impact of climate change was already being felt. Dr Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, said: Changes in the intensity and likelihood of extreme weather is how climate change manifests. That doesn\u2019t mean every extreme event is more intense because of it, but a lot are. For example, every heatwave occurring in Europe today is made more likely and more intense by human-induced climate change. But extreme events occur locally, so many things play a role: location, season, intensity and duration. The influence of each of these factors depends strongly on the specific event. With our international initiative World Weather Attribution, we did in a rapid analysis of the heatwave that struck large parts of Europe during the last week of June 2019. We found that it was made at least five times more likely due to human induced climate change. Here is the latest from across Europe, courtesy of the Associated Press. Hot, hotter, hottest! Paris, London and points across Europe are bracing for record temperatures Thursday as the second heat wave this summer bakes the continent. Climate scientists warn this could become the new normal in many parts of the world. But temperate Europe where air conditioning is rare isn\u2019t equipped for the temperatures frying the region this week. So tourists frolicked in fountains to seek relief and authorities and volunteers fanned out to help the elderly, sick and homeless hit hardest by the heat. Trains were canceled in Britain and France, and French authorities urged travellers to stay home. One by one, heat records are being broken across Europe . On Thursday, the Paris area could be as hot as 42 C (108 F) as a result of hot, dry air coming from northern Africa that\u2019s trapped between cold stormy systems. London might see 39 C (102 F). And swaths of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland could face temperatures exceeding 40 C (104 F). And this is only the latest of several hot days: Belgium and Germany recorded their all-time high temperatures Wednesday. Germany\u2019s record of 40.5 degrees (104.9 F) is likely going to be very short-lived, however the German Weather Service is expecting even higher temperatures Thursday. Across London and Paris, authorities and charity workers handed out water and sunscreen to homeless people and opened day centers for them to rest and shower. \u201cThey are in the street all day, under the sun. No air conditioning, no way to protect oneself from the heat, so for some it\u2019s really quite complicated,\u201d said Ruggero Gatti, an IT worker joining other Red Cross volunteers handing out water bottles, soup and yogurt to the homeless in the Paris suburb of Boulogne. France is particularly on alert after a 2003 heat wave killed nearly 15,000 people, especially the elderly. Since then the government has introduced a color-coded heat alert system to warn people when temperatures are expected to rise to dangerous levels in their area and trigger government assistance efforts. The alert system went to its maximum level of red for the first time during last month\u2019s heat wave , when France saw its highest-ever recorded temperature of 46 degrees. On Thursday, about one-fifth of French territory was under a red alert, stretching from the English Channel through the Paris region and down to Burgundy. The national rail authority and Paris public transit system urged passengers to avoid travel Thursday. Messages to \u201cHydrate yourselves!\u201d came from the radio, television and public message boards. The heat wave is intense but expected to be short, with temperatures dropping Friday and Saturday. As emissions continue to warm the planet, scientists say there will be more and hotter heat waves, like those increasingly hitting the U.S. though it\u2019s too early to know whether this hot spell is linked to man-made climate change. \u201cThere is likely the DNA of climate change in the record-breaking heat that Europe and other parts of the world are experiencing. And it is unfortunately going to continue to worsen,\u201d said Marshall Shepherd, professor of meteorology at University of Georgia. In some places in southern England, the temperature has already exceeded 30C, according to the Met Office. Heathrow Airport has recorded a temperature of 31.6C (88.88F) and Kew Gardens, west London, has reached 31.7C (89.06F), as temperatures continue to climb with scattered thunderstorms are expected later. Good morning, As the UK bakes under heat which threatens to reach unprecedented highs of 39C today, we will bring you updates through the day as this July heatwave grips Europe. Scientists have linked the extreme heatwave to the climate emergency, and Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands recorded their highest ever temperatures yesterday, as my colleague Jon Henley reports. Across Britain today, there are severe warnings that the sweltering conditions could lead to thunderstorms. These could cause travel delays, flash flooding and power cuts. Yesterday, the bodies of three people were pulled from the water after they reportedly got into difficulty swimming \u2013 highlighting the dangers of cooling off in lakes and rivers. Southern and eastern England are said to have a 70% chance of temperatures rising to 39C today, beating the UK\u2019s July record of 36.7C and the all-time high of 38.5C, recorded in 2003. Last night, parts of England experienced a \u201ctropical night\u201d as temperatures failed to fall below 20C, the Met Office has said. St James Park in central London had an overnight minimum of 20.7C, while Wattisham, in Suffolk saw a overnight minimum of 20.8C and Cromer, on the Norfolk coast, experienced a minimum of 20.9C. Dr Nick Scriven, president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said NHS staff were \u201cstruggling\u201d as \u201cfew lessons had been learned\u201d from last year\u2019s heatwaves and few hospitals are prepared for the impact of intense heat. Last year, hospitals hired in large fans and coolers for a week or so but have got nothing long-term in place - they are purely reactive not proactive. Some better organisations bought in lots of bottled water and gave it to staff or brought round cooled drinks. To get drinks, staff would usually need to leave the ward to buy them. There is often nothing or very little in place for staff to get fluids on wards on an ad-hoc basis and they are expected only to drink in breaks which isn\u2019t right when temperature on wards are really high. Patient areas don\u2019t have coolers or ice machines due to infection concerns.

      "body": "<p>On a sweltering hot day in an east London primary, a play is taking place. George and the Dragon is being performed by a group of older actors, part of local community theatre group Immediate Theatre and the Arcola\u2019s over-50s group. The familiar story of the princess, the knight and the man-eating dragon is told in a traditional manner, but contemporary concerns such as the destruction of nature and the environment have been taken into account, adding a crucial new twist.</p> <p>The dragon\u2019s natural habitat has been destroyed, deforestation has ruined its home, and it has nothing to eat other than the townsfolk. The children in the audience are asked to vote whether the dragon should live or die. Today\u2019s performance is the final of six that the group have performed to local primary schools across east London; although the vote is for life, it\u2019s the closest it has come to death. One of the boys who voted for death said it\u2019s \u201cbecause the dragon took thousands of lives!\u201d Another declares: \u201cI don\u2019t trust dragons!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"07eab3313e723845a89e13c7f66962360985e4f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07eab3313e723845a89e13c7f66962360985e4f4/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"George and the Dragon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sympathy for the dragon \u2026 a post-show discussion after George and the Dragon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gbenga Olopade</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe prepared two endings,\u201d says writer Penny Cliff. The less bloody one, which we saw today, has the characters coming together to plant seeds symbolising a fresh start.</p> <p>Over the last few years, the levels of air pollution around primary schools in cities across the UK has made headlines. There have been calls for more to be done to improve air quality for children, especially after the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/02/ella-kissi-debrah-new-inquest-granted-into-air-pollution-death\">Ella Kissi-Debrah</a>, a girl from Lewisham with severe asthma, whose death may have been related to pollution levels on the route she took to school. Cliff says she did not want to make the play too specific to one issue such as air pollution near schools and instead wanted to focus more on \u201cthe impact of poisoning the environment\u201d. She explains: \u201cIt is important to write a piece of theatre that is not specific about one thing, but one that communities can take away from it what they need to take, based on how it resonates with them.\u201d</p> <p>And indeed this week, children from the six schools are joining the older performers to create an intergenerational sequel that they will then perform. The children come from a wide range of backgrounds; many live on local estates. Jo Carter, the show\u2019s director and the founder of the company, says: \u201cWe hope that by working creatively together, all our participants will get to know each other and understand the opportunities and challenges faced by residents at opposite ends of the age spectrum.\u201d Working with both older and younger people is what makes Immediate Theatre and its partnership programmes so rare.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c4e5be57c8b45fa138b51fd0392094fb44af8c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c4e5be57c8b45fa138b51fd0392094fb44af8c3/0_0_2880_1920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nightingale Graffiti project\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nightingale Graffiti project.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Hart</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What are the communities? The cast, a mixture of professional and amateur actors, also come from east London. Steve Latner, who plays the judge, also grew up on a rough estate and joined a community theatre group that helped change the direction of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see a different pathway,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething like Immediate Theatre does this.\u201d<br><br>David Howells, a retired computer science lecturer, plays an oak tree and one of the town\u2019s citizens. \u201cThis is the first stage show I\u2019ve done since I dried up when I was 15 in a school show!\u201d he says. He used to work in a sheltered housing community in east London and saw firsthand how community theatre overcomes social barriers when Immediate Theatre did a project with the people there based on their experiences during the second world war. <br><br>So what\u2019s on the cards for the sequel? Responses from the children range from wanting to see George turn evil and kill everyone, to George and the dragon becoming best friends and planting seeds to help restore the natural environment so the dragon no longer has to eat people.

      "bodyText": "On a sweltering hot day in an east London primary, a play is taking place. George and the Dragon is being performed by a group of older actors, part of local community theatre group Immediate Theatre and the Arcola\u2019s over-50s group. The familiar story of the princess, the knight and the man-eating dragon is told in a traditional manner, but contemporary concerns such as the destruction of nature and the environment have been taken into account, adding a crucial new twist. The dragon\u2019s natural habitat has been destroyed, deforestation has ruined its home, and it has nothing to eat other than the townsfolk. The children in the audience are asked to vote whether the dragon should live or die. Today\u2019s performance is the final of six that the group have performed to local primary schools across east London; although the vote is for life, it\u2019s the closest it has come to death. One of the boys who voted for death said it\u2019s \u201cbecause the dragon took thousands of lives!\u201d Another declares: \u201cI don\u2019t trust dragons!\u201d \u201cWe prepared two endings,\u201d says writer Penny Cliff. The less bloody one, which we saw today, has the characters coming together to plant seeds symbolising a fresh start. Over the last few years, the levels of air pollution around primary schools in cities across the UK has made headlines. There have been calls for more to be done to improve air quality for children, especially after the death of Ella Kissi-Debrah, a girl from Lewisham with severe asthma, whose death may have been related to pollution levels on the route she took to school. Cliff says she did not want to make the play too specific to one issue such as air pollution near schools and instead wanted to focus more on \u201cthe impact of poisoning the environment\u201d. She explains: \u201cIt is important to write a piece of theatre that is not specific about one thing, but one that communities can take away from it what they need to take, based on how it resonates with them.\u201d And indeed this week, children from the six schools are joining the older performers to create an intergenerational sequel that they will then perform. The children come from a wide range of backgrounds; many live on local estates. Jo Carter, the show\u2019s director and the founder of the company, says: \u201cWe hope that by working creatively together, all our participants will get to know each other and understand the opportunities and challenges faced by residents at opposite ends of the age spectrum.\u201d Working with both older and younger people is what makes Immediate Theatre and its partnership programmes so rare. What are the communities? The cast, a mixture of professional and amateur actors, also come from east London. Steve Latner, who plays the judge, also grew up on a rough estate and joined a community theatre group that helped change the direction of his life. \u201cIt\u2019s important to see a different pathway,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething like Immediate Theatre does this.\u201d David Howells, a retired computer science lecturer, plays an oak tree and one of the town\u2019s citizens. \u201cThis is the first stage show I\u2019ve done since I dried up when I was 15 in a school show!\u201d he says. He used to work in a sheltered housing community in east London and saw firsthand how community theatre overcomes social barriers when Immediate Theatre did a project with the people there based on their experiences during the second world war. So what\u2019s on the cards for the sequel? Responses from the children range from wanting to see George turn evil and kill everyone, to George and the dragon becoming best friends and planting seeds to help restore the natural environment so the dragon no longer has to eat people. Regardless of what happy or bloody direction the sequel takes, Carter hopes the children will gain from the experience of working with the older actors. \u201cIt\u2019s not like this is a lovely five minutes and then goodbye,\u201d she says. \u201cIn terms of developing cultural capital, it\u2019s about ongoing experiences. If you want to [access theatre] you should be able to, even if you don\u2019t have a lot of money or if you live in the wrong place. Art is an essential part of education.\u201d Immediate Theatre\u2019s work sees them engage in a range of community-based theatre projects.

The 16-year-old has also been charged with possession of cannabis while the 15-year-old has been charged with handling stolen goods. Another 16-year-old boy, from Wandsworth, south-west London, has been charged with theft and handling stolen goods. In June, two teenagers were arrested on suspicion of assault after what was claimed to be a homophobic knife attack in Liverpool. In the same month, a Guardian analysis found that homophobic and transphobic hate crimes had more than doubled in England and Wales over the last five years. The rate of LGBT hate crime per capita increased by 144% between 2013-14 and 2017-18. Police recorded 11,600 crimes in the most recent year of data, more than doubling from 4,600 during this period.",

He has no plan for Brexit, no plan to rebuild our public services, and no plan to tackle the climate emergency. He\u2019s a phoney who promises big but whose priority, when it comes down to it, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-tax-plan-beneficiaries-will-be-80-male-says-labour\" title=\"\">tax cuts</a> for the super-rich and the biggest corporations.</p> <p>Just look at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\" title=\"\">cabinet</a> he has chosen: a collection of hard-right zealots plucked from the most reactionary reaches of the Tory party. Not only that, but two of them pose a national security risk: the education secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/may/01/brexit-latest-news-pmqs-may-liaison-pm-to-face-questions-from-mps-amid-claims-she-is-preparing-for-deal-with-labour-live-news\" title=\"\">Gavin Williamson,</a> was only recently sacked from the cabinet for leaking information about Huawei, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/25/priti-patel-record-human-rights-extreme-concern\" title=\"\">the home secretary, Priti Patel,</a> was forced to resign after holding secret meetings with a foreign government behind the UK\u2019s back. So much for the party of national security.</p> <p>How can it be that a man who only became prime minister because of Brexit doesn\u2019t have a serious plan for leaving the European Union? The no-deal swagger is a sign of Conservative failure, not success. It is designed to protect the interests of the Conservative party, not the country.</p> <p>No deal wouldn\u2019t return sovereignty to the UK, it would make us dependent on a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump. No wonder the US president is delighted, christening Johnson \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d. He already named his price when he was in the UK: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/05/nhs-america-brexit-trump\" title=\"\">our NHS</a>, prised open for US corporations to feast on.</p> <p>For Johnson, no deal is an opportunity to put on his best suit and fly a union jack like he\u2019s at the Last Night of the Proms, but it\u2019s people from working-class communities like mine who will suffer the consequences when British industry is savaged, jobs are destroyed, food prices rise and the NHS runs short of medicines.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be Johnson and his allies who pay the price, just as it wasn\u2019t ultimately the bankers who paid the price for the financial crash of 2008 \u2013 it was working people here, and around the world.</p> <p>Labour won\u2019t let that happen again. That\u2019s why we will do everything possible to stop no deal.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s tactic is already clear. Question his wild promises, challenge his lies, even just ask for some details and you will be denounced as a defeatist. Perhaps it\u2019s easy for Johnson and the rest of the super-rich elite to be upbeat about the world. But it doesn\u2019t reflect the experience of millions of people in our country.</p> <p>Take the Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/06/pension-inequality-older-women-age-earnings-injustice\" title=\"\">campaigning for the pension money</a> that has been taken from them.

      "bodyText": "It was a typical Boris Johnson performance in the Commons today, all waving arms and blustering rhetoric. It\u2019s nothing new \u2013 we\u2019re used to him offering us dead cats, or even kippers. But it shouldn\u2019t disguise the fact that he is committed to a dangerous, hard-right agenda. The \u201cborn to rule\u201d arrogance just poured off him. Jeremy Corbyn posed 10 questions on vital issues, ranging from investment to Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. Johnson didn\u2019t answer any of them. People have a right to demand more from their prime minister. Behind the comedy routine, the truth about Johnson is he\u2019s a real Tory, the bankers\u2019 friend (No one \u201cstuck up more for the bankers,\u201d according to Johnson himself). He has no plan for Brexit, no plan to rebuild our public services, and no plan to tackle the climate emergency. He\u2019s a phoney who promises big but whose priority, when it comes down to it, is tax cuts for the super-rich and the biggest corporations. Just look at the cabinet he has chosen: a collection of hard-right zealots plucked from the most reactionary reaches of the Tory party. Not only that, but two of them pose a national security risk: the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, was only recently sacked from the cabinet for leaking information about Huawei, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, was forced to resign after holding secret meetings with a foreign government behind the UK\u2019s back. So much for the party of national security. How can it be that a man who only became prime minister because of Brexit doesn\u2019t have a serious plan for leaving the European Union? The no-deal swagger is a sign of Conservative failure, not success. It is designed to protect the interests of the Conservative party, not the country. No deal wouldn\u2019t return sovereignty to the UK, it would make us dependent on a sweetheart deal with Donald Trump. No wonder the US president is delighted, christening Johnson \u201cBritain\u2019s Trump\u201d. He already named his price when he was in the UK: our NHS, prised open for US corporations to feast on. For Johnson, no deal is an opportunity to put on his best suit and fly a union jack like he\u2019s at the Last Night of the Proms, but it\u2019s people from working-class communities like mine who will suffer the consequences when British industry is savaged, jobs are destroyed, food prices rise and the NHS runs short of medicines. It won\u2019t be Johnson and his allies who pay the price, just as it wasn\u2019t ultimately the bankers who paid the price for the financial crash of 2008 \u2013 it was working people here, and around the world. Labour won\u2019t let that happen again. That\u2019s why we will do everything possible to stop no deal. Johnson\u2019s tactic is already clear. Question his wild promises, challenge his lies, even just ask for some details and you will be denounced as a defeatist. Perhaps it\u2019s easy for Johnson and the rest of the super-rich elite to be upbeat about the world. But it doesn\u2019t reflect the experience of millions of people in our country. Take the Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) campaigning for the pension money that has been taken from them. How about students calling for education to be a right, not a privilege? Or the young people angry that they can\u2019t afford a decent house? What about the older people who struggle to afford heating in winter while private energy giants pay out huge dividends to shareholders? Are they all naysayers? Are they all defeatists? No, of course they\u2019re not. These people are the heart of our country, and they want it to work in their interests, not just those of the few at the top. Only Labour has a plan to make that happen. So here\u2019s some real optimism about the kind of country we could be: a country that values our NHS, and gives it the funding it needs; one with free childcare, free school meals for primary schoolchildren, and free colleges and universities so our young people get the start they deserve; and one where older people are respected, with the winter fuel allowance, free TV licences and bus passes locked in and guaranteed. A country where workers are paid properly for the hard work they do, with a real living wage of \u00a310 per hour for all ages. A country that tackles climate breakdown with a green industrial revolution that will create 400,000 jobs while helping to reduce our emissions to net zero. Labour will boost the economy by getting investment to where it\u2019s needed most. And we\u2019ll force corporations and the rich to pay their fair share of taxes and stop ripping us off, so we can change the country and deliver world-class universal services. Johnson and his cabinet of hard-right ideologues are in the pockets of millionaire bankers and corporate lobbyists; Labour is a movement of millions that can\u2019t be bought off. That\u2019s the difference. Labour is the party for the many. Johnson leads a government of the few, by the few \u2013 and for the few. \u2022 Angela Rayner is MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and shadow education secretary",

      "body": "<p>Bad news about youth custody generally comes either in the form of a tragedy or a warning. This week\u2019s is the latter: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/24/children-will-not-be-placed-at-feltham-for-time-being-minister\" title=\"\">report</a> from the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, identifying an \u201cextraordinary\u201d decline in safety at Feltham young offender institution in outer London. Coming so soon after April\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/09/twenty-prison-officers-injured-after-violence-at-feltham-youth-jail\" title=\"\">outbreak of violence</a>, and filled with details that make clear the extent to which violence remains endemic, the report makes Feltham\u2019s continuing failure plain for all to see. The government\u2019s announcement that placements will be halted until improvements have been made may provide short-term relief. It will do nothing to resolve the systemic problems of youth custody in England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/08/child-imprisonment-is-wrong-lets-end-it\" title=\"\">which have led reformers to call for youth jails to be closed down</a>.</p> <p>This is far from the only challenge awaiting the newly appointed secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor, Robert Buckland. Disarray and dysfunction in the justice system go far wider than the 42 young offender institutions (four of which hold under 18s, along with one in Wales, the rest being for 18-21s) and three secure training centres in England. The failed privatisation of probation, pressure on courts due to budget cuts, severe overcrowding and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/25/assault-self-harm-record-levels-jails-england-wales-prisons\" title=\"\">record levels of self-harm</a> in jails all require attention. But the law states that Mr Buckland must address inspectors\u2019 concerns about Feltham within 28 days.</p> <p>Mr Clarke pointed to a 45% rise in violent incidents in six months. Three-quarters of teenagers reported that they had been physically restrained by staff. Incidents of self-harm have tripled. No useful purpose can be served by holding young people in such conditions. Ministers and youth justice experts know this.</p> <p>Understanding of the damaging effects on young people of incarceration has grown rapidly in recent years, with Scotland adopting a research-based <a href=\"https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/research/impact-and-engagement/edinburgh-study-of-youth-transitions-and-crime\" title=\"\">\u201c</a><a href=\"https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/research/impact-and-engagement/edinburgh-study-of-youth-transitions-and-crime\" title=\"\">whole </a><a href=\"https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/research/impact-and-engagement/edinburgh-study-of-youth-transitions-and-crime\" title=\"\">system </a><a href=\"https://www.law.ed.ac.uk/research/impact-and-engagement/edinburgh-study-of-youth-transitions-and-crime\" title=\"\">approach\u201d</a> focused on keeping 16- and 17-year-olds out of the criminal justice system. In England and Wales too the number of young people arrested for notifiable (more serious) offences has plummeted, from more than 300,000 a decade ago to fewer than 66,000 in 2017-18. In May this year there were <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/youth-custody-data\" title=\"\">830 under-18s in custody</a> (all but 33 of them boys); a decade ago the figure was 2,541.</p> <p>But this is no cause for complacency or, worse, excuses for failure with regard to those who remain locked up. Half of the children in custody are black or minority ethnic (compared with a quarter of inmates in adult prisons): a disgracefully high rate given BAME representation in the population as a whole. Almost all children in custody have experienced adverse life events such as bereavement, poverty, addiction or being taken into care.</p> <p>The use of pain-inducing restraint and solitary confinement on children should, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/19/end-pain-inducing-restraints-on-child-offenders-mps-urge\" title=\"\">as MPs have argued</a>, be made illegal. Much more must be done to tackle sexual abuse, of which there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/28/children-in-young-offender-institutions-at-risk-of-abuse-inquiry-finds\" title=\"\">1,070 alleged instances</a> between 2009 and 2017. But the heart of the problem is that youth jails are brutalising places. The scandal of mistreatment at Medway youth training centre in 2016 shows that these supposedly more modern alternatives are not the answer, while the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/01/uks-first-secure-school-to-be-run-by-academy-trust\" title=\"\">rebrand of Medway</a> as a \u201csecure school\u201d under an academy trust with no experience of youth custody appears alarmingly naive.</p> <p>If young people are to be supported to find a way of making a contribution to society, as well as being punished, they would be much better off under the care of local authorities (many of whom will know them already) in secure children homes. More serious offenders move on to adult prisons in any case. Not all youth jails have Feltham\u2019s history of violence. But that doesn\u2019t make them the right place for a child.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 July 2019 to clarify that not all of the 42 young offender institutions are for under-18s, as an earlier version suggested. Four hold under 18s, and the rest are for 18-21s.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bad news about youth custody generally comes either in the form of a tragedy or a warning. This week\u2019s is the latter: a report from the chief inspector of prisons, Peter Clarke, identifying an \u201cextraordinary\u201d decline in safety at Feltham young offender institution in outer London. Coming so soon after April\u2019s outbreak of violence, and filled with details that make clear the extent to which violence remains endemic, the report makes Feltham\u2019s continuing failure plain for all to see. The government\u2019s announcement that placements will be halted until improvements have been made may provide short-term relief. It will do nothing to resolve the systemic problems of youth custody in England, which have led reformers to call for youth jails to be closed down. This is far from the only challenge awaiting the newly appointed secretary of state for justice and lord chancellor, Robert Buckland. Disarray and dysfunction in the justice system go far wider than the 42 young offender institutions (four of which hold under 18s, along with one in Wales, the rest being for 18-21s) and three secure training centres in England. The failed privatisation of probation, pressure on courts due to budget cuts, severe overcrowding and record levels of self-harm in jails all require attention. But the law states that Mr Buckland must address inspectors\u2019 concerns about Feltham within 28 days. Mr Clarke pointed to a 45% rise in violent incidents in six months. Three-quarters of teenagers reported that they had been physically restrained by staff. Incidents of self-harm have tripled. No useful purpose can be served by holding young people in such conditions. Ministers and youth justice experts know this. Understanding of the damaging effects on young people of incarceration has grown rapidly in recent years, with Scotland adopting a research-based \u201cwhole system approach\u201d focused on keeping 16- and 17-year-olds out of the criminal justice system. In England and Wales too the number of young people arrested for notifiable (more serious) offences has plummeted, from more than 300,000 a decade ago to fewer than 66,000 in 2017-18. In May this year there were 830 under-18s in custody (all but 33 of them boys); a decade ago the figure was 2,541. But this is no cause for complacency or, worse, excuses for failure with regard to those who remain locked up. Half of the children in custody are black or minority ethnic (compared with a quarter of inmates in adult prisons): a disgracefully high rate given BAME representation in the population as a whole. Almost all children in custody have experienced adverse life events such as bereavement, poverty, addiction or being taken into care. The use of pain-inducing restraint and solitary confinement on children should, as MPs have argued, be made illegal. Much more must be done to tackle sexual abuse, of which there were 1,070 alleged instances between 2009 and 2017. But the heart of the problem is that youth jails are brutalising places. The scandal of mistreatment at Medway youth training centre in 2016 shows that these supposedly more modern alternatives are not the answer, while the government\u2019s rebrand of Medway as a \u201csecure school\u201d under an academy trust with no experience of youth custody appears alarmingly naive. If young people are to be supported to find a way of making a contribution to society, as well as being punished, they would be much better off under the care of local authorities (many of whom will know them already) in secure children homes. More serious offenders move on to adult prisons in any case. Not all youth jails have Feltham\u2019s history of violence. But that doesn\u2019t make them the right place for a child. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 July 2019 to clarify that not all of the 42 young offender institutions are for under-18s, as an earlier version suggested. Four hold under 18s, and the rest are for 18-21s.",

French breeders provide about a quarter of eggs hatched in the UK that go on to become the birds that form the centrepiece of festive dining tables. But supplies are about 10% down on expected levels after temperatures have topped 40C (104F) in France according to Paul Kelly, chairman of the British Turkey Federation and the boss of free-range turkey producer KellyBronze.

The potential egg shortages come as turkey farmers also face potential cost rises from a shortage of labour partly caused by uncertainty over Brexit which has put off workers coming to the UK. But Shraddha Kaul of the British Poultry Council said it had not received reports from members about problems with egg production in the UK, which accounts for about three-quarters of supplies to farmers here. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on supply of French eggs but hopefully the supply issues will be sorted out sooner rather than later,\u201d she said. \u201cBritish turkey farmers have worked hard to have a sustainable supply of meat for Christmas.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The father of a soldier who collapsed and died during a fitness test on a hot summer\u2019s day has said there were organisational failings in the way the exercise was run. Cpl Joshua Hoole, from Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland, died during the routine physical assessment in Brecon in south Wales in July 2016. Hoole, 26, of the Rifles infantry regiment, collapsed close to the spot where three recruits had suffered fatal heat illness on an SAS test march three years before. Speaking at a pre-inquest review in Birmingham, his father, Phillip Hoole, said: \u201cFor me, there were organisational failings, well above any individual failings.\u201d Phillip Hoole, who served 24 years with the army as a company sergeant-major, said he was worried that soldiers could still be exposed to danger during training exercises in very hot weather. Hoole was carrying 25kg (55lb) of equipment when he collapsed 400 metres from the end of the eight-mile (13km) course. A 2017 Defence Safety Authority report concluded the \u201cfit, capable and determined\u201d soldier died as a result of an undiagnosed underlying medical condition, \u201cwithin the definition of sudden arrhythmogenic death syndrome\u201d. The report\u2019s author, Col Jim Taylor, said Hoole \u201cdid not die as a direct result of doing the annual fitness test, despite July 19 being a hot day and two other members of the cadre requiring medical treatment for heat illness\u201d. Hoole\u2019s father rejected that conclusion and successfully applied for the inquest\u2019s resumption. The senior coroner Louise Hunt, who will hear the inquest, adjourned the proceedings this year pending an update by the Royal Military Police on its investigations into the death. At a hearing on Thursday, Hunt ruled that the full inquest could be heard in Birmingham starting on 1 October. Hunt was told there were currently no charges against any individuals involved in staffing the routine fitness test at Dering Lines barracks three years ago. She was also told by the Service Prosecuting Authority (SPA), an independent organisation within the Ministry of Defence (MoD), that it was unlikely the inquest would interfere with potential future prosecutions. Phillip Hoole said: \u201cI believe holding the inquest is imperative because some organisational failings could lead to some mitigation for some of the individuals that could subsequently be charged with offences. In fairness to them, I believe this inquest should go forward.\u201d Col Richard Allen, for the SPA, said: \u201cThe service police have referred four individuals to their respective commanding officers.

The other three are, as yet, technically to be referred to the SPA but we anticipate they will be.

      "bodyText": "Jonathan Freedland\u2019s assertion that Boris Johnson\u2019s cabinet \u201cis startlingly rightwing\u201d is, sadly, something of an understatement (From today, the Brexiters will have no one else to blame, 25 July). The co-authors of Britannia Unchained, which infamously described British workers as \u201camong the worst idlers in the world\u201d, and British children having no aspiration, being only \u201cinterested in football and pop music\u201d, are in such dominant roles, they are bound to have a huge influence on all policies. With Raab and Patel at the Foreign and Home offices respectively, Truss the international trade secretary and Kwarteng as business minister, all talk of Johnson\u2019s \u201cone nation\u201d conservatism is clearly nonsense. So much for the prime minister\u2019s pledges on \u201cuniting our country\u201d. The book actually stated that the UK should stop the irrelevant debates about \u201csharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men\u201d. Heaven help us. Bernie Evans Liverpool \u2022 Jonathan Freedland refers to Dominic Cummings as having been found in contempt of parliament. I cannot see anywhere any reference to the consequences of that, such as jail, or a fine, or being banned from holding public office or working for someone in public office.

      "bodyText": "We note with interest this week\u2019s appointment of Ruby McGregor-Smith as chair of the new Office of Tackling Injustices (OfTI). We sincerely hope that one of OfTI\u2019s top priorities will be to rectify the gross injustice experienced by 3.8 million women born in the 1950s who have lost up to six years of their state pensions, with little or no notice. We 1950s women have faced injustice throughout our lives. We started work before the protection of the equalities legislation of the 1970s and many of us were not allowed to join occupational pension schemes or take on mortgages without a male guarantor. Now the state pension is the sole source of income for 68% of women, compared with 44% of men. Taking away years of the pensions we have paid into all our lives is perhaps the worst injustice of all.

      "bodyText": "Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon has surged above three football fields a minute, according to the latest government data, pushing the world\u2019s biggest rainforest closer to a tipping point beyond which it cannot recover. The sharp rise \u2013 following year-on-year increases in May and June \u2013 confirms fears that president Jair Bolsonaro has given a green light to illegal land invasion, logging and burning. Clearance so far in July has hit 1,345 sq km, a third higher than the previous monthly record under the current monitoring system by the Deter B satellite system, which started in 2015. With five days remaining, this is on course to be the first month for several years in which Brazil loses an area of forest bigger than Greater London. The steady erosion of tree cover weakens the role of the rainforest in stabilising the global climate. Scientists warn that the forest is in growing danger of degrading into a savannah, after which its capacity to absorb carbon will be severely diminished, with consequences for the rest of the planet. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to keep repeating these concerns.

It means we have to do things right away. Unfortunately that is not what is happening. There are people denying we even have a problem.\u201d It may also complicate ratification of Brazil\u2019s biggest ever trade deal with the European Union if EU legislators decide the South American nation is not keeping its side of the bargain, which includes a commitment to slow deforestation in line with the Paris climate agreement. The official numbers from the National Institute for Space Research are a growing embarrassment to Bolsonaro, who has tried to fob them off as lies and criticised the head of the institute. Earlier this week, the president insisted the numbers should be screened by the ministry of science and technology and shown to him before being made public so that he did not get \u201ccaught with his pants down\u201d. This has raised fears that the data could be vetted in future rather than automatically updated online each day as is currently the case. In his first seven months in power, Bolsonaro, who was elected with strong support from agribusiness and mining interests, has moved rapidly to erode government agencies responsible for forest protection. He has weakened the environment agency and effectively put it under the supervision of the agricultural ministry, which is headed by the leader of the farming lobby.

He said Salles had eradicated the department responsible for policies to combat deforestation, that no leaders have been appointed in eight of the nine Ibama regional offices, and that operations to combat environmental crimes declined 70% between January and April 2019 compared with the same period last year. The Deter satellite data is considered preliminary, but it is usually a guide to the longer-term trends. More detailed annual figures are usually released towards the end of the year, after the National Institute for Space Research has calculated data from the more powerful Prodes satellite system. Trees are considered essential to climate stability. Earlier this month, a study indicated that planting a trillion trees could remove two-thirds of all the emissions that have been pumped into the atmosphere by human activities. But scientists say maintaining existing forests, particularly in the tropics, is far more important.",

      "body": "<p>A fearful realisation, but it appears that, in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/27/ksi-logan-paul-youtubers-fight-boxing-match-manchester-arena\" title=\"\">Logan Paul</a>, the world may be in the presence of a genius. Is that genius good or evil? I have yet to decide. Logan Paul has yet to decide. We will only know one way or another when he explodes the moon as some sort of viral prank.</p> <p>For those of you born before the year 1998: Paul is a YouTuber, most famed among people who are allowed to portion-control their Ribena on the assurance that they won\u2019t get too hyper on it (that means: you and, to a lesser extent, me) for the January 2018 video where he went to Japan\u2019s Aokigahara forest, or \u201csuicide forest\u201d, and found and broadcast footage of a dead body there. You are not supposed to do that, it turns out. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/10/logan-paul-youtube-removed-premium-channel\" title=\"\">YouTube cut ties with him</a>, Paul lost thousands of subscribers and commercial partners, and went to ground for a month before coming back with an apology video. And now he\u2019s \u2026 hold on, bigger than ever? </p> <p>It\u2019s hard to ever know what\u2019s going on with YouTubers: they exist in a strange and fascinating liminal area of fame, where they are enormously, hugely, Beatlemania-famous to millions of people, but all of those people have curfews and intricate Proactiv routines and can\u2019t legally buy scratchcards, so it doesn\u2019t really count. If you have ever accidentally strayed into the wilds of Instagram and said to yourself: \u201cWho is this teenager, and why do they have nine million followers?\u201d, you will already know this. Logan Paul never stopped being famous to people who knew who Logan Paul was before he became The Infamous Logan Paul. And now he\u2019s crossed over into the mainstream, again, briefly bobbing his head above the Actual Fame waters before dipping back down into the merch-and-a-podcast depths, and traditional media is baffled all over again. Thirteen-year-olds, as they always do, smile knowingly in the background.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1153395615977672722\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Logan Paul was just on Fox Business and, well, it was something <a href=\"https://t.co/MbCCoERNu3\">pic.twitter.com/MbCCoERNu3</a></p>&mdash; jordan (@JordanUhl) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1153395615977672722?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 22, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>The latest prank/exquisite worldwide Derren Brown-style mindfreak (delete as appropriate) was Paul\u2019s appearance on Fox Business, which soon went viral, studded as it was with non-sequiturs about how fast he could run (\u201cI\u2019m the fastest YouTuber \u2013 I\u2019m the fastest entertainer on the planet\u201d), an outlandish bet to see if anyone could outpace him (\u201cYeah, I\u2019m betting $100,000 that I\u2019m the fastest man on the planet\u201d) and his current health status (\u201cI also have pinkeye\u201d). For Paul haters, the video was a gift: that forest wanker, making a fool of himself on national TV! Like and retweet! For Paul\u2019s fandom (the \u201cLogang\u201d), the video was endorsement of their lord, and the godly powers he holds: a deliberately erratic TV appearance designed to go viral and get coverage in the newspapers and websites of yore, those fusty old institutions that don\u2019t understand him.</p> <p>\u201cI bank on the naivety of old people and millennials, to perpetuate my brand, make me go viral and keep me relevant,\u201d Paul told his podcast, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/impaulsiveshows?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">ImPaulsive</a>, after the clip had gone viral. \u201cThe amount of earned media I got because of this clip \u2013 hundreds of thousands of dollars, for free, because of the haters.\u201d Paying attention to Paul just makes him more powerful, people! That\u2019s what he wants!</p> <p>As a result, Paul \u2013 who made $14.5m last year \u2013 is this weekend throwing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbwq7BejMRI\" title=\"\">The Challenger Games</a>, where various YouTubers you have never heard of will compete in various track and field events for cash prize donations to local charities. It\u2019s not the first time Paul has pivoted to athletics \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/aug/27/ksi-logan-paul-youtubers-fight-boxing-match-manchester-arena\" title=\"\">he boxed fellow YouTuber KSI last year</a>, in a PPV match that reportedly made them both millions. Once again: Paul is a machine designed to make money, no matter how hard and how publicly that engine explodes.</p> <p>This has positive repercussions for the extended Paul universe, too: it makes them more famous. Paul\u2019s brother Jake \u2013 with whom he is near-constantly embroiled in a Gallagher-style love-hate public spat \u2013 is recently engaged to fellow YouTuber <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClWD8su9Sk6GzZDwy9zs3_w\" title=\"\">Tana Mongeau</a> (4.5 million followers), despite the pair only dating for three months. This week she managed to: prank Jake into thinking she was with child, using a dummy pregnancy test and a hidden camera; go out to dinner with ex-girlfriend Bella Thorne\u2019s recent ex <a href=\"http://Mod%20Sun\" title=\"\">Mod Sun</a>, which caused Twitter beef with Thorne because the three of them used to be in a polyamorous throuple before Mongeau met Jake; bat off suggestions from the older Paul that her and Jake\u2019s relationship is a fake idea; and reveal a billboard advertising her MTV special, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBPLVvU_jvGv6tAh6QdJu-MrY9zpzkjHd\" title=\"\">Tana Turns 21</a>. Most of these people were born in 1997, and are millionaires. The world is a very exhausting place to be.</p> <p>It\u2019s Logan that threatens me the most, though. The waterproof way he just bats off controversy. The casual, joking manner with which he makes vast amounts of money. His recent reinvention as a sort of athletic Howard Stern, fronting up the world\u2019s number one podcast by basically burping and shouting into a microphone. The knowing way he manipulates the great old gears of media to do what he wants. It\u2019s not a great push to imagine him, in 10 years, the first YouTube billionaire, heading up a Murdochian media empire, cackling atop a skyscraper built in the shape of his head. From then on, it goes two ways: Doctor Evil world destroyer, or four-term president. As my inevitable future employer and possible executioner: I wish you nothing but luck, Logan Paul. Nothing but luck and good energy.</p> <h2>Has Alex from Glastonbury found the path to fame?<br></h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/01/alex-mann-the-teenage-rap-fan-who-lit-up-glastonbury\" title=\"\">Alex from Glasto</a> news now, and the cherub-faced viral star \u2013 he very much looks like if Justin Bieber got into aggressively shouting at you outside a Spar instead of having a multi-million dollar pop career \u2013 has finally released his debut song. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHie4M8PuoE\" title=\"\">What Ya Kno\u2019 \u2019Bout That Bro?</a> is an erratic two minutes and 37 seconds of Alex slowly boasting about wearing a hat and getting on stage with rapper Dave at Glastonbury, and how Thiago Silva now follows him on Twitter.</p> <p>What is the point? Well, it\u2019s hard to know, but I have a theory. In wider culture we call this Ferdification, after clonk-headed mechanic Ferdi Mathew-George, the Albanian mechanic who last year got hit in the head with a bike so hard he released a song about it: taking a bit of viral currency, and trying to turn it, alchemy-like, into something, anything. Both Alex and Ferdi dived head first into the \u201cwaving in nightclubs\u201d personal appearance scene. Both garnered huge semi-ironic social media followings. Both released overproduced videos with GRM Daily, where the line between \u201cis this a pisstake?\u201d and \u201cis this \u2026 actually good?\u201d became alarmingly blurred. Ferdi, for his sins, disappeared without a trace, I guess because saying <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTAm9loH0SY\" title=\"\">\u201cwhy you coming fast?\u201d</a> a lot and not really knowing where the joke is can only last so long. Alex, if nothing else, seems to have a faint idea that he needs to take every chance he gets while he can, just in case. If nothing else comes from this, at least he got a music video, Dave\u2019s phone number and (I\u2019m speculating here) a cornucopia of mucky DMs.</p> <p>Is What Ya Kno\u2019 \u2019Bout That Bro? a good song? Absolutely no. Is it an earnest attempt to turn 15 minutes of fame into the best summer of one human bucket hat-cum-GCSE student\u2019s life? Yes. And is it so mad to think that this can\u2019t be a path to legitimate, actual fame, in these bizarre hot times we live in? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/dec/01/how-cardi-b-went-from-stripper-to-star\" title=\"\">Cardi B</a> got her start doing sort of motivational speeches on Instagram, and look at her now. Lil Nas X managed to leverage a medium-to-large Nick Minaj stan account into making <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ysFgElQtjI\" title=\"\">Old Town Road</a> the biggest song of 2019. There is no normal path to fame any more, and we need to let go of the old beliefs that tell us otherwise. Alex from Glasto might be the only person who recognises the truth any more. He\u2019s the only smart one left.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A fearful realisation, but it appears that, in Logan Paul, the world may be in the presence of a genius. Is that genius good or evil? I have yet to decide. Logan Paul has yet to decide. We will only know one way or another when he explodes the moon as some sort of viral prank. For those of you born before the year 1998: Paul is a YouTuber, most famed among people who are allowed to portion-control their Ribena on the assurance that they won\u2019t get too hyper on it (that means: you and, to a lesser extent, me) for the January 2018 video where he went to Japan\u2019s Aokigahara forest, or \u201csuicide forest\u201d, and found and broadcast footage of a dead body there. You are not supposed to do that, it turns out. YouTube cut ties with him, Paul lost thousands of subscribers and commercial partners, and went to ground for a month before coming back with an apology video. And now he\u2019s \u2026 hold on, bigger than ever? It\u2019s hard to ever know what\u2019s going on with YouTubers: they exist in a strange and fascinating liminal area of fame, where they are enormously, hugely, Beatlemania-famous to millions of people, but all of those people have curfews and intricate Proactiv routines and can\u2019t legally buy scratchcards, so it doesn\u2019t really count. If you have ever accidentally strayed into the wilds of Instagram and said to yourself: \u201cWho is this teenager, and why do they have nine million followers?\u201d, you will already know this. Logan Paul never stopped being famous to people who knew who Logan Paul was before he became The Infamous Logan Paul. And now he\u2019s crossed over into the mainstream, again, briefly bobbing his head above the Actual Fame waters before dipping back down into the merch-and-a-podcast depths, and traditional media is baffled all over again. Thirteen-year-olds, as they always do, smile knowingly in the background. The latest prank/exquisite worldwide Derren Brown-style mindfreak (delete as appropriate) was Paul\u2019s appearance on Fox Business, which soon went viral, studded as it was with non-sequiturs about how fast he could run (\u201cI\u2019m the fastest YouTuber \u2013 I\u2019m the fastest entertainer on the planet\u201d), an outlandish bet to see if anyone could outpace him (\u201cYeah, I\u2019m betting $100,000 that I\u2019m the fastest man on the planet\u201d) and his current health status (\u201cI also have pinkeye\u201d). For Paul haters, the video was a gift: that forest wanker, making a fool of himself on national TV! Like and retweet! For Paul\u2019s fandom (the \u201cLogang\u201d), the video was endorsement of their lord, and the godly powers he holds: a deliberately erratic TV appearance designed to go viral and get coverage in the newspapers and websites of yore, those fusty old institutions that don\u2019t understand him. \u201cI bank on the naivety of old people and millennials, to perpetuate my brand, make me go viral and keep me relevant,\u201d Paul told his podcast, ImPaulsive, after the clip had gone viral. \u201cThe amount of earned media I got because of this clip \u2013 hundreds of thousands of dollars, for free, because of the haters.\u201d Paying attention to Paul just makes him more powerful, people! That\u2019s what he wants! As a result, Paul \u2013 who made $14.5m last year \u2013 is this weekend throwing The Challenger Games, where various YouTubers you have never heard of will compete in various track and field events for cash prize donations to local charities. It\u2019s not the first time Paul has pivoted to athletics \u2013 he boxed fellow YouTuber KSI last year, in a PPV match that reportedly made them both millions. Once again: Paul is a machine designed to make money, no matter how hard and how publicly that engine explodes. This has positive repercussions for the extended Paul universe, too: it makes them more famous. Paul\u2019s brother Jake \u2013 with whom he is near-constantly embroiled in a Gallagher-style love-hate public spat \u2013 is recently engaged to fellow YouTuber Tana Mongeau (4.5 million followers), despite the pair only dating for three months. This week she managed to: prank Jake into thinking she was with child, using a dummy pregnancy test and a hidden camera; go out to dinner with ex-girlfriend Bella Thorne\u2019s recent ex Mod Sun, which caused Twitter beef with Thorne because the three of them used to be in a polyamorous throuple before Mongeau met Jake; bat off suggestions from the older Paul that her and Jake\u2019s relationship is a fake idea; and reveal a billboard advertising her MTV special, Tana Turns 21. Most of these people were born in 1997, and are millionaires. The world is a very exhausting place to be. It\u2019s Logan that threatens me the most, though. The waterproof way he just bats off controversy. The casual, joking manner with which he makes vast amounts of money. His recent reinvention as a sort of athletic Howard Stern, fronting up the world\u2019s number one podcast by basically burping and shouting into a microphone. The knowing way he manipulates the great old gears of media to do what he wants. It\u2019s not a great push to imagine him, in 10 years, the first YouTube billionaire, heading up a Murdochian media empire, cackling atop a skyscraper built in the shape of his head. From then on, it goes two ways: Doctor Evil world destroyer, or four-term president. As my inevitable future employer and possible executioner: I wish you nothing but luck, Logan Paul. Nothing but luck and good energy. Has Alex from Glastonbury found the path to fame? Alex from Glasto news now, and the cherub-faced viral star \u2013 he very much looks like if Justin Bieber got into aggressively shouting at you outside a Spar instead of having a multi-million dollar pop career \u2013 has finally released his debut song. What Ya Kno\u2019 \u2019Bout That Bro? is an erratic two minutes and 37 seconds of Alex slowly boasting about wearing a hat and getting on stage with rapper Dave at Glastonbury, and how Thiago Silva now follows him on Twitter. What is the point? Well, it\u2019s hard to know, but I have a theory. In wider culture we call this Ferdification, after clonk-headed mechanic Ferdi Mathew-George, the Albanian mechanic who last year got hit in the head with a bike so hard he released a song about it: taking a bit of viral currency, and trying to turn it, alchemy-like, into something, anything. Both Alex and Ferdi dived head first into the \u201cwaving in nightclubs\u201d personal appearance scene. Both garnered huge semi-ironic social media followings. Both released overproduced videos with GRM Daily, where the line between \u201cis this a pisstake?\u201d and \u201cis this \u2026 actually good?\u201d became alarmingly blurred. Ferdi, for his sins, disappeared without a trace, I guess because saying \u201cwhy you coming fast?\u201d a lot and not really knowing where the joke is can only last so long. Alex, if nothing else, seems to have a faint idea that he needs to take every chance he gets while he can, just in case. If nothing else comes from this, at least he got a music video, Dave\u2019s phone number and (I\u2019m speculating here) a cornucopia of mucky DMs. Is What Ya Kno\u2019 \u2019Bout That Bro? a good song? Absolutely no. Is it an earnest attempt to turn 15 minutes of fame into the best summer of one human bucket hat-cum-GCSE student\u2019s life? Yes. And is it so mad to think that this can\u2019t be a path to legitimate, actual fame, in these bizarre hot times we live in? Cardi B got her start doing sort of motivational speeches on Instagram, and look at her now. Lil Nas X managed to leverage a medium-to-large Nick Minaj stan account into making Old Town Road the biggest song of 2019. There is no normal path to fame any more, and we need to let go of the old beliefs that tell us otherwise. Alex from Glasto might be the only person who recognises the truth any more. He\u2019s the only smart one left.",

He moved to Wembley Liberal Synagogue in 1975 and then in 1982 to Zurich, Switzerland. On retirement he became chair of the Liberal Beit Din, responsible for accepting people into Judaism. Many converts have testified to the warm welcome to Judaism he gave them in this capacity. In 2016, Harry visited the Calais refugee camp in France with Lord (Alf) Dubs and was inspired to campaign with Safe Passage for child refugees, saying: \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any restrictions at all to saving lives when you can save lives.\u201d He made a short video for Unicef, Harry and Ahmed, and spoke frequently at schools and Holocaust memorial events. Harry was appointed MBE in 2006 for services to the Jewish community. His resilience and optimism, especially in caring for Rose and their son, David, before their deaths from dementia in 2014 and 2016, were inspirational. He is survived by his children Richard and me, and by his grandchildren, Joshua, Abigail, Hannah, Yoni and Tali, and great-grandchildren, Zachary and Harry.",

It is called the Mueller report.\u201d And if people were still asking the same question? \u201cThe answer is yes, yes, he should,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to force the world\u2019s grumpiest law-daddy to read between the lines of his report when you could just read the lines.\u201d Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was also underwhelmed by the morning\u2019s activities but learned to find pleasure in the small things. At one point, Mueller said that some of Trump\u2019s behaviour was not just problematic but that the word would be an understatement. \u201cProblematic is an understatement is a pretty scathing indictment for a man whose version of \u2018I love you\u2019 is probably \u2018It\u2019s safe to say there is some fondness,\u2019\u201d he said. Colbert said it was clear that Trump \u201cwelcomed the help of those who were breaking the law\u201d and one Democrat asked Mueller if he worried that this would lead to the normalisation of this behaviour to which he responded: \u201cI hope it\u2019s not the new normal but I fear it is.\u201d Colbert then joked: \u201cIt\u2019s also the slogan for the new steak reaper ranch fries burrito\u201d. Trevor Noah On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah started by saying that Mueller\u2019s 450-page report was \u201c450 pages too long\u201d. One of the morning\u2019s most interesting moments saw Mueller revealing that Trump could be convicted of obstructing the law after he leaves office. \u201cSo you know what that means?\u201d Noah asked. \u201cTrump is never leaving office.\u201d Throughout his time being interviewed, Mueller was often asked to read out sections of the report to which he consistently refused. \u201cHe\u2019s like the world\u2019s least co-operative audio book,\u201d Noah said. He continued: \u201cPoor Robert Mueller, man. The guy spent two years writing up an incredibly thorough document and now people are badgering him with questions he\u2019s already answered. It would be like if Jesus came back and we spent hours asking him to explain stuff that was already in the Bible\u201d Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers ridiculed Trump\u2019s claim that he wouldn\u2019t be watching the testimony since he watches \u201cmore TV than is medically advisable\u201d. He\u2019s also sure that Trump hasn\u2019t read the 450-page report. \u201cThere\u2019s no way Trump\u2019s ever read anything that long in his life,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he gets a fortune cookie, he hands it to one of his aides, saying \u2018Just give me the gist.\u2019\u201d Meyers then ran through Trump\u2019s unhinged Twitter activity that morning. \u201cHis tweets would make more sense if they were scribbled on paper and faxed to a newspaper under the Zodiac symbol,\u201d he said. He found it strange that Mueller was constantly being asked to confirm paragraphs from the report that he wrote himself. \u201cHe already wrote down everything he knows,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like if you called in Ernest Hemingway to grill him about one of his books.\u201d",

S\u00e1nchez only needed a simple majority in parliament to get a deal across the line but after 48 hours of hectic negotiating the Podemos leader, Pablo Iglesias, announced his party would abstain during the second round of voting and the result was 124 in S\u00e1nchez\u2019s favour, 155 against and 67 abstentions. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of the left if we lose even when we win?\u201d an exasperated S\u00e1nchez asked Iglesias before the vote. The sticking point has been Podemos\u2019s desire for more ministerial positions than S\u00e1nchez was willing to offer, in particular the portfolio of the exchequer. \u201cI aspire to preside over the Spanish government but not at any price,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cWe can\u2019t put the public exchequer in the hands of someone who has never managed a state budget.\u201d As both sides sought to blame the other, S\u00e1nchez\u2019s deputy, Carmen Calvo, complained that Podemos had not given an inch in the negotiations since Tuesday\u2019s failed investiture and had pushed for what it had wanted all along, \u201ca government within the government\u201d. \u201cWe ask for respect,\u201d Iglesias said in reply to S\u00e1nchez. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to negotiate in 48 hours what we haven\u2019t been able to achieve in 80 days.

      "body": "<h2><strong>FIFTY SHADES OF GOLD</strong></h2> <p>Back in the day, it didn\u2019t matter who you supported: if a team from England was playing a match against European opposition, you\u2019d give them your blessing. Take, for example, the passion on display across the entire country when Wolverhampton Wanderers took on Honved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/13/wolves-world-champions-honved-molineux-hungary-wembley\">in a prestige floodlit friendly</a> in December 1954. The BBC cleared the schedule of Britain\u2019s only TV channel to show the second half live, while the whole thing was the subject of radio commentary on the Light Programme. Everyone was on tenterhooks to find out whether Stan Cullis\u2019s champions could put Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis, Zoltan Czibor and Jozsef Bozsik back in their box after England\u2019s recent 6-3 and 7-1 Hungary humiliations. And they did it! Whoop! What a glorious nation!</p> <p>Admittedly they only managed this after flooding the pitch when two goals down at half-time in order to jigger Honved\u2019s passing artistry. Hoof! Hoick! Belt! A 3-2 win! That\u2019ll teach \u2018em. But it was a close-run thing. In the dying seconds of the match, Czibor smashed a shot goalwards from six yards. Wolves goalie Bert Williams parried; Bill Slater cleared. However on the Light Programme, millions were now swinging along to big-band music, the continuity announcer having faded the commentary out in a panic when the match over-ran by 75 seconds. The day after, several national newspapers carried the story of a listener in a pub in Sunderland, incensed at not knowing the final result, hoying a bottle of ale into the radio receiver in impotent rage. It must have been a slow news day. Still, at least people across the country, regardless of their day-to-day allegiances, really cared, eh?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/24/nuno-espirito-santo-coca-cola-football-wolves\">Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo: \u2018It is like Coca-Cola, they never change the recipe\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether the nation will be similarly enchanted by Wolves\u2019 latest foray into Europe is another matter. Tonight, 65 years since Honved, 47 years since they were defeated by Spurs in the final of Euro Vase, and 39 years since they last competed on the continent, losing to PSV Eindhoven in the first round of the same competition, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s men will take on Crusaders in the second qualifying round of Euro Vase. \u201cI feel a lot of pride,\u201d says the manager. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big game for the club.\u201d Indeed it is. And yet there\u2019ll be no country-halting coverage on the nation\u2019s most popular channel this time. Instead, the game will be tucked away out of sight on Premier Sports. As a result, few outside partisan enclaves of the Black Country and north Belfast will be on 50s-style tenterhooks waiting for the final score tonight. Sad times, though public bars all across Wearside will breathe a huge sigh of relief.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cSeeing Luka at the age of 17 \u2013 young, short, skinny, a guy who was full of passion, full of drive and aspiration.

The BBC cleared the schedule of Britain\u2019s only TV channel to show the second half live, while the whole thing was the subject of radio commentary on the Light Programme. Everyone was on tenterhooks to find out whether Stan Cullis\u2019s champions could put Ferenc Puskas, Sandor Kocsis, Zoltan Czibor and Jozsef Bozsik back in their box after England\u2019s recent 6-3 and 7-1 Hungary humiliations. And they did it! Whoop! What a glorious nation! Admittedly they only managed this after flooding the pitch when two goals down at half-time in order to jigger Honved\u2019s passing artistry. Hoof! Hoick! Belt! A 3-2 win! That\u2019ll teach \u2018em. But it was a close-run thing. In the dying seconds of the match, Czibor smashed a shot goalwards from six yards. Wolves goalie Bert Williams parried; Bill Slater cleared. However on the Light Programme, millions were now swinging along to big-band music, the continuity announcer having faded the commentary out in a panic when the match over-ran by 75 seconds. The day after, several national newspapers carried the story of a listener in a pub in Sunderland, incensed at not knowing the final result, hoying a bottle of ale into the radio receiver in impotent rage. It must have been a slow news day. Still, at least people across the country, regardless of their day-to-day allegiances, really cared, eh? Whether the nation will be similarly enchanted by Wolves\u2019 latest foray into Europe is another matter. Tonight, 65 years since Honved, 47 years since they were defeated by Spurs in the final of Euro Vase, and 39 years since they last competed on the continent, losing to PSV Eindhoven in the first round of the same competition, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo\u2019s men will take on Crusaders in the second qualifying round of Euro Vase. \u201cI feel a lot of pride,\u201d says the manager. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big game for the club.\u201d Indeed it is. And yet there\u2019ll be no country-halting coverage on the nation\u2019s most popular channel this time. Instead, the game will be tucked away out of sight on Premier Sports. As a result, few outside partisan enclaves of the Black Country and north Belfast will be on 50s-style tenterhooks waiting for the final score tonight. Sad times, though public bars all across Wearside will breathe a huge sigh of relief. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cSeeing Luka at the age of 17 \u2013 young, short, skinny, a guy who was full of passion, full of drive and aspiration. As a young coach, I wasn\u2019t sure he was going to make it \u2026 [but] he was smelling something good. When I saw him in the World Cup final, I had goosebumps.\u201d \u2013 Romeo Jozak recalls coaching a young Luka Modric in Croatia. The man they call \u2018Dr Romeo\u2019 is now in charge of Kuwait, who are on a curious tour of England. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI was moved by the plight of Stuart McLagan [Wednesday\u2019s Fiver] and feel compelled, as one Stuart to another, to come to his assistance. I was fortunate enough to win a prize (The London Football Companion, used copies available for \u00a30.01 on Amazon) for a letter back on 26 February, and the sheer scale of the delight this gave me probably says something about my life. So that another Stuart can experience something similar, what if I return my prize back to Fiver Towers so that it can be sent on? I don\u2019t want anything in return (unless he has a Millennium Falcon lying around). Just the idea of another Stuart experiencing what I did is enough for me\u201d \u2013 Stuart Robertson-Reed. \u201cIn taking over as president of the Rugby Football League, Tony Adams opined, \u2018I\u2019ve been bored out of my brains at some recent football games with all the sideways passing.\u2019 Um\u2026 who\u2019s going to tell him?\u201d \u2013 Jim Hearson. \u201cWho better than Hollywood bad boy Russell Crowe to provide commentary for a Nasty Leeds documentary? Only they could employ someone who amongst numerous other unsavoury incidents, had a fight in a fancy Japanese restaurant that had to be broken up by Ross Kemp. Blackeye Rovers will probably have to tap up Colin Farrell to stand any chance of competing\u201d \u2013 Ben North. \u201cSuccint album reviews, you say? How about Charles Shaar Murray\u2019s 1973 NME review of Lee Hazlewood\u2019s Poet, Fool or Bum: \u2018Bum\u2019\u201d \u2013 Barrie Francis. \u201cI was quite surprised to read Paul Dunlop\u2019s letter and see the name Johnty spelled the same way that I spell my name, considering I have not once come across this. The real surprise came from something in the Fiver grabbing my attention enough to give me reason to actually send something in. It feels like I should include HHAGTFABM, just to keep the side up.\u201d \u2013 Johnty Marshall. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day prize is \u2026 Ben North. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS Everton are eager, anxious, impatient, yearning to sign Moise Kean from Juventus \u2013 but the Italian forward could cost a cool \u00a336m. The Toffees have at least pocketed more than \u00a320m from the sale of Ademola Lookman to RB Leipzig. Juve could put some of that Kean cash towards repaying a 116-year-old debt to Notts County. The Magpies famously supplied the Turin side\u2019s first black and white kits \u2013 and now local MP Lillian Greenwood is asking them to help the cash-strapped Magpies pay for new shirts for next season. Bernard Cribbins insists he\u2019s not at Newcastle just to do Mike Ashley\u2019s bidding. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be anybody\u2019s yes man,\u201d Bruce muttered as he scraped vomit from a fireplace. \u201cI\u2019m not Mike Ashley\u2019s bagman or anything else. I\u2019m my own man.\u201d Manchester City suit Ferran Soriano has hit back at claims the club were a bit up themselves when they visited China. \u201cWe are not arrogant anywhere. Our players were close to the fans,\u201d he snooted. \u201c[Other teams] just come here to play a game. Our commitment and investment in China is far, far more.\u201d Aston Villa have added \u00a315m City midfielder Douglas Luiz to their heaving sack of summer recruits, with Club Brugge midfielder Marvelous (yep) Nakamba set to follow. And Bury are set to start their League One campaign on minus 12 points \u2013 but the EFL has warned the club they risk expulsion over their ongoing financial concerns. STILL WANT MORE? Holsten! Avco! JVC! Wang! Football Weekly\u2019s own Max Rushden remembers a simpler time for shirt sponsorship, and boosts his hipster credentials with a mention of Jeff Goldblum. Wolves head honcho Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo chats Coca-Cola, chess and cycles with Stuart James. Remember when Ademola Lookman banged in Everton\u2019s fourth against Pep Guardiola\u2019s Manchester City? It feels like a long time ago, muses Andy Hunter. Feast your eyes on pre-season pearlers and summer fitba fun in this week\u2019s Classic YouTube. Wilfried Zaha to \u2026 Everton? Oh the Mill, you do keep us guessing.

      "bodyText": "Professional boxing has suffered its second death in less than a week after Argentinian fighter Hugo Alfredo \u201cDinamita\u201d Santillan died on Thursday from injuries sustained in the ring. He was 23. Santillan\u2019s death comes only days after Russian boxer Maxim Dadashev died from injuries he suffered during a fight last Friday. The 28-year-old was placed into a medically induced coma after the fight but died on Tuesday. Santillan, a super lightweight, was fighting against Uruguay\u2019s Eduardo Javier Abreu in Buenos Aires on Wednesday night. According to local reports, his nose started to bleed in the fourth round but he finished the fight. However, as the result of the bout \u2013 a draw \u2013 was announced, he fainted and was taken to hospital. \u201cUpon admission to the hospital, he had successive kidney failure and he did not come out of his coma,\u201d said Dr Graciela Olocco of Hospital Agudos San Felipe. \u201cHe had swelling of his brain and he never recovered consciousness. The swelling continued to worsen and it affected the functioning of the rest of his organs.\u201d Olocco added that Santillan had surgery for a clot on the brain but died after a cardiac arrest at 12.35am local time on Thursday. Santillan was the son of another professional boxer, Hugo Alfredo Santillan. He had a record of 19 wins, six losses and two draws going into Wednesday\u2019s fight.",

      "bodyText": "Right, that\u2019s us \u2013 thanks all for your company and comments, sorry I couldn\u2019t get to them all. Join us for more fun tomorrow! Here\u2019s your report of today\u2019s fun and games, hopefully featuring much ice lolly thought and coastline outrage. Check back for our man\u2019s thoughts in due course. Wiggins says that Thomas is a winner, so won\u2019t be happy with a podium finish - \u201cWhat\u2019s third place when you\u2019ve won it?\u201d Good question; I\u2019m not qualified to answer, so I\u2019ll believe him. He reckons Thomas will risk it all to retain his title, which should make the next two days absolutely brilliant. Geraint Thomas says they wanted it to be hard but the pace wasn\u2019t there, so they agreed Bernal would go. It doesn\u2019t seem like him going too was a rogue move, and he says he felt pretty good today so wanted to see what others had. He did say beforehand that he didn\u2019t think there\u2019d be much movement today, which he flags, then notes that there are two hard days to come. Wiggins can\u2019t believe the chasers didn\u2019t try and loz Alaphilippe sooner, and reckons the group lack confidence in their legs. And overall: Alaphilippe loses five seconds of lead, with Bernal overtaking Thomas to claim second place; as Ryan Giggs would say, he\u2019d\u2019ve took that. Pending a monumental collapse or attack, he\u2019s going to win the race! Today\u2019s top finishers: And chill. That 20 minutes when Quintana attacked, Bernal attacked, Thomas attacked, Alaphilippe faded and Alaphilippe recovered, absolutely amazing gear. Tomorrow is going to be a boss. Thomas just didn\u2019t have it there when he needed it there. Unless he\u2019s keeping something monumental to uncork tomorrow, that title isn\u2019t getting retained. That\u2019s a wondrous effort from him, and might just be enough to win him the thing! If tomorrow goes ok, that should be enough! Here they come... Bernal finishes, but what will he take out of the yellow jersey? Bernal bousts his heart out as the rain comes down, looking to eke out every second that he can. And behind him, Bardet eases home; he\u2019s going to take the polka dot jersey, for the now at least. That\u2019s a phenomenal ride! He absolutely cleansed the field, and it\u2019s great to see him back! Anyway, here comes Quintana! \u201cIt is strange how Thomas declared it would have been improper to attack when Bernal was up the road in the Pyrenees but apparently can do it now. Both Bernal and Thomas\u2019s attacks might be for nought now. Bizarre move,\u201d says @distolas, who also reports that Belgian telly agree: \u201c\u2018If Thomas was a good teammate he wouldn\u2019t have attacked out of that group with Bernal up the road. He\u2019d also be on the front of the group in the descent slowing it where possible\u2019. Ouch!\u201d Never underestimate the power of the panic station. 3.2km to go; can the yellow jersey group catch Alphilippe? He\u2019s 33s ahead of them. Alaphilippe has made a miraculous recovery, which makes Bernal\u2019s break look all the better. He timed it perfectly, and Alaphilippe is now putting time into his rivals on the descent! And here he comes! He catches the group, and France is dreaming of its first GC winner since Bernard Hinault in 1985! Might he even extend his lead today? Pinot is up with Thomas as Alaphilippe fights back; the gap is 10 seconds, and if Alaphilippe can get out of this stage losing just that, he\u2019ll start to dream of champagne on the Champs Elysees. Quintana screeches down the descent, and it\u2019s terrifying just to watch. The yellow jersey is 18s behind Thomas, who\u2019s 24s behind bernal. Pinot and pals catch Thomas, while Alaphilippe tries to fight back. Alaphilippe loses the wheel! Pinot steps on it! This is steaming! Alaphilippe is going backwards and spectators try to shove him up the hill! AND GERAINT THOMAS GOES! His team-mate is looking to tax his second place, and Thomas say \u201cNot today!\u201d Bernal has 45 seconds on the yellow jersey group, and will move up to second if this continues. Thomas hasn\u2019t responded, and he\u2019s leaving himself a lot to do tomorrow if he doesn\u2019t make a move. Except, is Quintana even thinking about the stage, or is he planning another assault tomorrow to try and shake up the general classification? He looks so strong here. Quintana is basically home! He\u2019s at the top of the climb and now just needs to stay on his bike for 18.3km of descent and the stage is his! A couple of lads with a Colombian flag run alongside Bernal, who is putting it in! What a day this could be for Locombia! And what a pleasure it is to see Quintana back ... EXCUSE ME WHILE I INTERRUPT MYSELF! In the yellow jersey group, Bernal attacks! Can he race the legs off Alaphilippe? 20.1km to go! Quintana surely has this in the sac \u00e0 main. Are Ineos and Geraint Thomas just going to let this expire? Stephen Kelly notes that usually they win from the front and wonders whether they know how to do it from behind. They note in commentary that Quintana looks way better than last week, and I\u2019ve not a clue how that\u2019s possible given the worsening activity in which he\u2019s been perpetually engaged in that time. Rrrridiculous. \u201cAfternoon Daniel,\u201d says Dennis Johns. \u201cWhen Bardet won a stage a couple of years ago they used On A Ragga Tip for the closing credits and it is literally my favourite thing that has ever happened in the Tour. Felt like the leisure pursuits of my younger and older selves were finally unified.\u201d You need to go spinning, which is also like being in the klurrb but with intensified bad bits and without the good bits. Alaphilippe is on Thomas\u2019 wheel, as Soler is dropped. Quintana leads Bardet and Lutsenko by 51s! The gap from yellow jersey to front is growing! Good news for Alaphilippe, and Ineos aren\u2019t doing anything. \u201cI am currently lying by a lake in the Alps,\u201d says Martin Brooks, \u201cand have just had a Solero Bio - it\u2019s a lemon affair with a soft centre, 57 calories and Vegan - it\u2019s so frinking Guardian but pricey at 2.5 Euro - living the dream.\u201d I can\u2019t believe I thought \u201cMmm, 57 calories. What have I become. Quintana is really close! He\u2019ll know that if he can maintain this, the stage is his! He\u2019s timed this so well, and looks absolutely nails in the saddle. Now Bardet attacks, Woods and Caruso dropped. Quintana leads by 32s, and the chasers have no option but to boust! Quintana piles it on while the others decide what to do about him. 25.3km to go! Quintana attacks! After riding with so much vigour, suddenly Lutsenko looks tired. Caruso is currently second, but the lead is increasing; he\u2019s maybe 20s ahead. Lutsenko is having it! He attacks again, because what else would you do when you\u2019re absolutely finished towards the end of a month-long slog. Perfectly normal behaviour. Here we go! The leading group start the Galibier, while Alaphilippe is midway in his minyan. Adam Yates is in shtuck, and has been dropped. Caruso leads, Lutsenko there too, and Bardet; Quintana just behind. They\u2019re warming up! The yellow jersey group are closing on the front, 4.38 behind now. I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s because they\u2019re speeding it up, as opposed to the front lads slowing it down. Van Baarle goes to the front of the yellow jersey group and Castroviejo immediately drops. Can they do it for Geraint Thomas? Alaphilippe pulls faces, but the pace is ok for him for now Alaphilippe is looking pretty ok you know. Is anyone going to take a piece out of him? 30.7km to go... \u201cI had no idea that you went to finishing school, posh boy?\u201d emails John Lacey. I\u2019m close to sending this to my wife and various chat groups, so I can print their comments on my table manners and such. \u201cI\u2019ve just recently been to Albania,\u201d says Bobbinson Crusoe. \u201cCheck out the Valbone to Theth trek for mountains or the crystal clear waters of places like Dhermi for beaches. Surely Europes most underrated country? And most importantly, the beer is good and cheap! Durmitor National Park in Montenegro can also give most places a run for their money when it comes to beautiful mountain scenery.\u201d Totally. I\u2019ve not been but investigated as part of not going to the European Super Cup when my lot played in it the summer before last 1000m of climb left for the breakaway, who lead the Swindon yellow jersey lot by roughly five and a half minutes. It\u2019s hotting up with 36.8km to go. Van Avermaet can\u2019t deal, so departs the leading group, but in the yellow jersey sect, Alaphilippe is still like Betty Boo. This is rapidly becoming the guardianest blog I\u2019ve ever written, and I\u2019m now thinking about codifying the entries to help with my holidays. \u201cOur man in Huesca province writes,\u201d says @ejhchess, \u201cFrance is in a clear second place when it comes to the Pyrenees. (Or, given Andorra, possibly third).\u201d I\u2019m going naewhere near cuisine patter. My word, people are exercised. \u201cYou can leave France, come into Catalunya and very soon find superb beaches which even at this time of year you can have pretty much to yourself,\u201d says Keith Glazzard. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone! Great cycling country too.\u201d A break! Woods, Van Avermaet, Pauwels, Lutsenko, K\u00e4mna, Ch\u00e9rel and Benoot have surged away, with Quintana and Bardet 20s off. Right, up the Col du Galibier we go! There are now 16 in the Bardet-Quintana-Caruso group; obviously Lutsenko is at it. \u201cI think the Costa Brava in Spain might have something to say about the Med,\u201d reckons Alex Wright, \u201cbut I\u2019ll give France the Atlantic coastline.\u201d I\u2019m no expert, but I agree absolutely. I had two of the greatest weeks of my life in Lloret de Mar after finishing school. Room attacked by a nutter with a pool cue, mates randomly battered by local, er, independent vendors, randomly slapped by police - that holiday had everything. \u201cTechnically the Alps include the Dolomites in Italy,\u201d says Adam Baird, \u201cwhich are probably the most spectacular mountains in the world.\u201d Er, I\u2019ve been to Scafell Pike. And Box Hill. \u201cThe best of the Med?\u201d gasps Henry C. \u201cHave you been to Spain? Best of the Atlantic? Cadiz, Chipiona, Barbate, Azahara de las Aceitunas etc......Never mind you stick to your clich\u00e9s and I will enjoy the best beaches around.\u201d I asked because I don\u2019t know. I know our society has muddled things, but that ought still be the point of a question. With 50km to go, the yellow jersey group is 5.16 behind the leading lads. \u201cIneos have 4 in the yellow jersey group, to DQS 2 - and one up the road to help out,\u201d says Oliver Wilkes. \u201cSurely, if they don\u2019t ambush Alaphillipe on the Galibier, what\u2019s the point in those expensive domestiques? I\u2019m betting on 4km from the summit...\u201d I guess they might think tomorrow will work better, but if they have him here, is he going to have owt left then either? I meant to note earlier, our commentary reckoned that France has the best of the Alps, the best of the Med and the best of the Atlantic coast. Are we having that? Guillaume Martin escapes the slowing yellow jersey group, of which Ineos now has control. Can Geraint Thomas find something? \u201cI\u2019ve always been a fan of Major Layzers \u2018Bob Jungels is massive\u2019, tweets Andy Hilton. Ah, but was it \u201cBob Jungels is massive\u201d or Bob Jungelist massive\u201d? It\u2019s a bit shvach in the yellow jersey group at the moment; Alaphilippe will be loving it. Meanwhile, the lead break, six minutes ahead, comprises: \u201cBardet, Caruso, Quintana, Lutsenko, Woods et A.Yates, Pauwels, Bernard et K\u00e4mna.\u201d \u201cJumbo Visma,\u201d says Andrew Hardy. \u201cAnybody else hear this as \u2018Jumbo Rizla\u2019? Must be the heat.\u201d One of my dunderheaded mates used to think the great Riz Lateef was called Rizla Teeth. 20 years later, we\u2019re still telling him about it. \u201cSurely he deserves a song worthy of higher praise?\u201d tweets Marc S. \u201cDey Bardet...\u201d \u201cWorthy of higher praise?\u201d How dare you insult my 1992. \u201cI reckon Alaphillipe will be out the back of that group within 2km of the Galibier starting,\u201d says Matthew Lysaght. \u201cHe\u2019s been sat at the back for the last 3-4km and doesn\u2019t look great, not ideal positioning.\u201d It\u2019s hard to know; if i were him, I\u2019d be doing as little as possible in the knowledge that an attack was en route. \u201cQuestions about why Fruit Pastilles ice lollies are so topsy-turvey can be avoided if one does the sensible thing and has a Tangle Twister instead,\u201d says Nick Honeywell. \u201cSurely that\u2019s the King of lollies.\u201d Depends what you\u2019re after. Twisters are good, but guzzzleable in two minutes flat and not as refreshing. Points for texture, but. Gregggg Wallace ain\u2019t got nowt on me. \u201cWhat ho,\u201d begins Kirsty Glover. \u201cThomas de Gendt = the start of the theme tune to The Addams Family. Finger clicks compulsory!\u201d The yellow jersey group are 5.13 off the front, with 70.3km to go. Surely they\u2019ll try binning Alaphilippe up the final climb? Adam Yates is in the chasing group now; can he match his brother and win a stage? \u201cNo Harm No Foul\u201d, emails Keats London. \u201cThat\u2019s how I would treat Rowe vs Martin\u2019s squabble. They\u2019re competitors for Pete\u2019s sake. They are doing what they are supposed to do. Let them play. Is TDF becoming the PGA where TV and replays can influence the outcome of the game? I sincerely hope not!\u201d I agree, more or less. Caruso wins the latest sprint, Bardet coming in second! They catch Bernard just before the line! A question about the aforementioned: why is it the yellow which goes all the way through and the purple which you only get on the very top? Does pretend blackcurrant cost more? Quintana, Dey Bardet and pals are closing on Bernard, whose lead is down to 40s with 75.4km to go. There\u2019s nothing for it: I need some effervescence, so am going to deploy my Fruit Pastilles lolly. Van Avermaet is bushed and back in the pack as Bernard rips on. The yellow jersey group, meanwhile, are scooting along; how long can Alaphilippe hang with these lads? \u201cNot quite a song which makes me think of him,\u201d says Boris Starling, \u201cbut a band title - Vladimir \u2018Inspiral\u2019 Karpets. Oh, and of course Singing In The Rain always makes me think of Singing Indurain.\u201d Bernard drops Van Avermaet! He\u2019s properly laying into the top bit of the climb. On the OBO the other day we were discussing sportsmen whose names make you sing them to a particular tune. For example, Mahmudullah to this. And I\u2019m now finding dey, Bardet going round and round my head. It\u2019s looking like Alaphilippe and Thomas will have themselves to themselves, without team-mates to protect them. Lovely stuff. \u201cCheating?\u201d asks Henry C. \u201cThere is cheating and cheating. Depends on your point of view. I don\u2019t remember when but one rider, when asked if he took illegal substances, sad \u2018How do you think we survive the whole tour?\u2019\u201d Apparently Landa announced that he was going to move. He looks relaxed ... I mean relax ... and Alaphilippe is ok too. With the climb getting even more munting, Movistar are making a move! Soler and Landa are at the front of the chasing group! Nibali has dropped off the back of the chasing group. So lazy. At the top we\u2019re getting towards an average of 10% gradient. Ain\u2019t but a number, as I like to say. Our co-comm tells us that Alaphilippe needs to go all-in today if he plans to win the thing, and if he does, he\u2019ll pay tomorrow. Decisions, decisions. A paltry 83.8km to go, and with 9km of Col d\u2019Izoard left, Van Avermaet and Bernard are two minutes ahead of what\u2019s become known as the Quintana group. \u201cJust catching up on the first part of the stage,\u201d says Nick Venables, \u201cand Quintana is in the break? Has his star fallen that far that the pelot\u00f3n don\u2019t even care that he\u2019s up front? Arkea-Samsic\u2019s manager must be wondering if his, I presume, huge contract is worth it.\u201d He\u2019s at the head of the group chasing the front two. He\u2019ll fancy himself to do something today, I shouldn\u2019t wonder. They\u2019re now 1.25 ahead and into the climb. They look pretty chilled in the circumstances; and when did \u201cchilled\u201d become \u201cchill\u201d? We\u2019re at the bottom of the Col d\u2019Izoard; Bernard and Van Avermaet lead by about 25s. \u201cI read somewhere that Henri Desgrange, who organized the very first Tour de France in 1903, envisioned a race so hard that only one rider would actually make it to Paris,\u201d emails Scott Urista. \u201cWe may see something like that over the next three days...\u201d If I may quote myself, I once wrote about that Tour, as follows: \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we know about our species, it\u2019s that we will cheat at anything: ever since Adam ate from the tree of knowledge and feigned ignorance to an omniscient God, every field of human endeavour is punctuated by our dazzling capacity for mendacity. In art there is forgery, in marriage there is adultery, in computers there is hacking, in finance there is insider dealing, and in politics, well how long have you got? So of course we cheat at sport; of course we have always cheated at sport. Consider the first Tour de France, for example, during which nine riders were disqualified - some of them for taking cars and trains. Of the 27 finishers, 15 more were pulled including the top four places and every stage winner. That was in 1904, and very little has changed.\u201d As it goes, the lads are looking ok, but could probably do with things being done. \u201cParklife has a bit of a place in my heart thanks to it coming out in the mid-90s, when the white heat of Britpop and my mid-teens combined in something suitably hormonally influential,\u201d says Neil Withers, \u201cBUT hearing or even imagining Damon Albarn singing \u2018...eating all the morsels\u2019 from Tracy Jacks sets my teeth on edge like nothing else on earth. Some cycling, just to keep us both honest: as much as I\u2019m sure we all like Geraint Thomas, surely we\u2019re all holding out for either Alaphilippe or Pinot to win this year? They\u2019ve both been awesome, Pinot v unlucky with that echelon split \u2013 plus France would go toutes bananes, non?\u201d That\u2019s actually End of a Century, which is one of the better ones I\u2019d say. It\u2019d be right up there if either of them pulled it off; whoever does will deserve it. Hi again, Vitamin D duly imbibed and here we go. There\u2019s just under 95km to go, and the gap between the leaders and the rest has stayed roughly the same. Arndt\u2019s ill-fated push for a solo break has come to nothing, but Greg Van Avermaet is now having a go as the Col d\u2019Izoard draws ever closer. And with that, I\u2019ll hand you back to Daniel ... The leading group are back on flat ground after the descent, with Sunweb\u2019s Nikias Arndt eking out a 20-second lead. There\u2019s a 7m 30sec gap between the leading pack and the peloton. Here\u2019s a bit of lunchtime viewing: Eesh, a nasty crash towards the back of the peloton, with Nicholas Roche and Jumbo-Visma\u2019s George Bennett \u2013 a key lieutenant for Steven Kruijswijk \u2013 coming off particularly badly. Thanks Daniel. The leading group have crested the Col de Vars, with Wellens taking the 10 King of the Mountains points ahead of Romain Bardet. Lutsenko was third, Quintana fourth. The peloton are about to reach the peak, with a long and winding descent to come. Right, I\u2019m off for a spot of lunch; Niall McVeigh takes over as your domestique for the next bit. \u201cModern Life is Rubbish was a far superior beast to Parklife,\u201d reckons Matthew Lysaght, \u201cwhich isn\u2019t difficult in fairness. Only saw them once, in 2003 in The Olympia in Dublin, when Coxon had been replaced by Simon Tong. Pinot to do the business today on Alaphillipe. Quintana for the stage.\u201d I saw them twice: once at the first V, and once when they reformed. I suppose they may have been better at various other times, but Damon isn\u2019t a good frontman and the tunes don\u2019t translate \u2013 aren\u2019t elevated \u2013 outside of the studio and lounge environment. The group catch Cherel, who wasn\u2019t into it at all. \u201cWhat do you think of yesterday\u2019s expulsions?\u201d asks Thomas Atkins. \u201cWouldn\u2019t blame you if you chose to ignore the whole affair in order to avoid the usual tedious pro and anti-Ineos traffic, but it strikes me that if I\u2019d been involved in a crash because two people had been involved in a willy-waving contest at the front of the bunch, I\u2019d be furious. IMO Martin and Rowe were lucky they didn\u2019t cause a serious injury to someone, and chucking them off the race seemed fair. On a side note, Martin and Rowe sounds like a mid-noughties nu-folk duo who were on the cusp of commercial success before Mummford and Sons came along and ruined the genre for everyone.\u201d I\u2019m almost always pro ruckus in sport, and would endeavour to judge according to what did happen rather than according to what might\u2019ve happened. Expulsion seems a bit much to me, though i understand why that was what happened. The gradient is starting to warm up and Cherel is up front, looking to increase the pace - perhaps for Bardet. 129km to go, 6.30 the gap to the peloton. \u201cCrossed to the dark side this morning,\u201d says Andrew Mullinder, \u201cand Armstrong and Hincape had an interesting take on the Rowe-Martin contretemps. They contended that it happened because there\u2019s no clear lead team this year, with Ineos not taking its usual Sky-boss role. Because of that, when roads narrow or key sections approach, several teams think they have a right to the prime locations in the Peleton. Given a tough tour well into its third week, and 40 degree heat, tempers -- and entitlement -- flared as they all jostled for that slot.\u201d Tempers are an integral part of all sport. \u201cO\u00ef!\u201d says Anne-Sophie O\u2019Connor. \u201cDon\u2019t diss Parklife, it\u2019s a brilliant album.\u201d It never spoke to me. End of a Century and This is a Low are good, but the rest of it? Sub-Madness mockney nonsense. Blur are also one of the very worst live bands I\u2019ve seen. \u201cCan you somehow get a message to the riders to make it a really exciting stage today?\u201d emails Stefan Glosby. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in an office without air conditioning and no work to do. Your coverage is the only thing keeping me going!\u201d One outta two ain\u2019t bad! The break lead the peloton by 5.56. among them is Tim Wellens, King of the Mountains, while guess who leads? Lutsenko is properly on one \u201cITV\u2019s celebration of yellow jerseys,\u201d emails Neil Withers, \u201cset me to thinking while cycling into work/the open door of a fan oven this morning and came out as the following (to a tune that should be obvious): Ma\u00eetre Jacques, Ma\u00eetre Jacques, Greg LeMond, Greg LeMond Sonny Colbrelli, Sonny Colbrelli Yates, Roche, Froome, Yates, Roche, Froome You can swap Greg LeMond for Indurain/Delgado if Spanish Tour winners from the 80s/90s is more your thing.\u201d It minded me of this, from an album that has very much not stood the test of time (nor was it great at the time, but that\u2019s another story). \u201cI\u2019ve been hoping it for some time now,\u201d tweets D-Lo, but is today finally going to be a big day for the Colombian boys?\u201d Bernal will fancy it for sure. Tangentially, the Colombian flag is lowkey banger. Pinot\u2019s Groupama lads tell Wiggins that they plan to attack on some mountains, but need to retain some energy for what\u2019s coming up. I wonder if he\u2019d go all-in if it looked liek the right thing to do. Apparently my email wasn\u2019t quite working, so please send joy to: daniel.harris.casual@theguardian.com. It seems that Perichon has been stung by a bee, and requires medical attention. Weird to think about the stuff he\u2019s done without requiring that. It\u2019s certainly hard to see Alaphilippe coming back if he loses his lead today. Pinot must surely fancy himself to perpetrate sadism and masochism this afternoon. In commentary, they reckon if Alaphilippe can stay in yellow today, he\u2019ll be well-placed, and the presence of Dylan Van Baarle in the break tells us that Ineos plan to hiy him. At 142.5km, the leading group are 4.39 in front. Quintana and Bardet at the front and Adam Yates is close by. The commentary mention the great Eddie Merckx, so here\u2019s this on him from Joy of Six: sporting beauty. Our breakers: Romain Bardet, Micka\u00eal Cherel, Mathias Frank (AG2R La Mondiale) Nairo Quintana, Andrey Amador, Carlos Verona (Movistar) Adam Yates, Daryl Impey, Chris Juul-Jensen (Mitchelton-Scott) Tim Wellens, Tiesj Benoot, Jasper De Buyst (Lotto Soudal) Greg Van Avermaet, Serge Pauwels, Simon Geschke (CCC Team) Alexey Lutsenko, Gorka Izagirre (Astana) Michael Woods, Alberto Bettiol (EF Education First) Lennard K\u00e4mna, Nikias Arndt (Team Sunweb) Mike Teunissen, Amund Jansen (Jumbo-Visma) Julien Bernard (Trek-Segafredo) Sergio Henao (UAE Team Emirates) Pierre-Luc P\u00e9richon (Cofidis) Dylan Van Baarle (Team Ineos) Nils Politt (Katusha-Alpecin) Damiano Caruso (Bahrain-Merida) Ama\u00ebl Moinard (Ark\u00e9a-Samsic) Paul Ourselin (Total Direct Energie) Mathieu Ladagnous (Groupama-FDJ) Maximilano Richeze (Deceuninck-QuickStep) So the breakaway are away/is away. Let me know which, grammar heroes. Of the leading group, now 41s clear, Quintana is the highest placed. There are 33 riders in the leading group, but though the start was a quick one, there\u2019s been no definitive escape. The Rowe/Martin penalty seemed harsh,\u201d tweets Guy Hornsby, \u201chowever sounds like TV didn\u2019t have all the evidence. ITV had a push from Martin, but it appears Rowe gave him a bit of a slap. Still, it all seems a bit handbags, and a distraction from the start of three immense stages.\u201d Yes, I can\u2019t for the life of me fathom why anyone\u2019s arsed enough not to just let it go. De Buyst and Arst take the big points, while Van Baarle leads the front group. Bardet is there, Quintana, and lots of other hopefuls. There\u2019s a big split in the peloton and the frankly unwell Lutsenko is involved again as they sprint for the line... We\u2019ve got an intermediate sprint coming up in 2km. About 20 riders have moved away, but not definitively so. Bardet is there towards the front \u2013 he fancies a stage win, you\u2019d think. There\u2019s been a crash of some sort - Caleb Ewan and and Wout Poels contrived to run each other over the edge of the round. Both are back on the road. Just the eight pints for me last night 169.1km to go. Peter Chymera asks for a stage breakdown... Decent second career for yerman Impey. He\u2019s pushing the pace now, perhaps setting it up for Adam Yates. Lutsenko, Yates, Impey and Kamna put in some work, and pull 16s away from the peloton. No way four\u2019s enough to cement a break, but perhaps they\u2019re trying to run the gas out of each other. 174.6m to go as Bradley \u201cBrad\u201d Wiggins tells us that \u201cyou have to pray\u201d for the lads doing the work. \u201cThey haven\u2019t even started the climb yet.\u201d Lutsenko is dragged back while we were enjoying some informational messages; apparently he had some stern words for his team-mates in the peloton. He\u2019s still keen to get it going, obviously, because who wouldn\u2019t be. Lutsenko has more than Perichon, pushing on without him - I\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s offended himself, but he\u2019s certainly making sure he won\u2019t forget it in a hurry. Behind him, Bardet is now in the group, and it\u2019s beginning to look like this might be the break. The yellow jersey group split on the descent but is now back together. Meanwhile, Turgis and Moinard have been caught by the front portion of the peloton, while Lutsenko and Perichon now have a gap of 20s. Up front, it\u2019s still Lutsenko and Perichon, with a group closing them down and moving away from a larger group behind. On Rowe, this from the wires: Sir Dave Brailsford suggested Team Ineos may take their complaints over Luke Rowe\u2019s expulsion from the Tour de France to the Court of Arbitration for Sport as the race continued without him on Thursday morning. Rowe turned up at the team bus in Embrun prior to stage 18 to Valloire in the slight hope that commissaires may overturn their decision to throw both Rowe and Jumbo-Visma\u2019s Tony Martin off the race following an altercation between the pair during Wednesday\u2019s stage 17. But the team always knew it was unlikely, describing it as a \u201c0.001 per cent chance\u201d, and Rowe instead left the start in a team van as the peloton set off into the Alps. Speaking before Rowe\u2019s arrival, Brailsford said: \u201cYou appeal and they say yes or no. If they say no then you go to CAS. That\u2019s the whole point of CAS as an arbitrator.\u201d It looks amazing up here (there). I wonder if the riders pay that any heed whatsoever. Lutsenko and P\u00e9ricon have opened a 10s lead; Turgis and Moinard are in pursuit. While we were on a break, Lutsenko was first to C\u00f4te des Demoiselles Coiff\u00e9es. P\u00e9richon took the other bonus point. Complete the following sentence: riding up mountains hurts, but have they ever... ...sprayed Lynx Marine onto their forearm for 36 seconds. Yates moves to the front as they near the top of the C\u00f4te de Demoiselles Coiff\u00e9es. The peloton reel Lutsenko in as the climbing continues. Looks alright, but is it near the Tube? Lutsenko sticks in a burst, a little clear of the peloton, and Simon Yates takes a good look at him. The peloton are back with Sagan, who was briefly away with three others. The climbing has already begun. There\u2019s a pretty good chance of some rain later today, which should make the descents even more disgraceful than you\u2019d expect. Sagan is forcing the pace in the break with 200km to go. After 112km, the lads pass the 3000km mark. I just let out a little squeak at my desk. In case you missed yesterday\u2019s fun and games... There\u2019s a slight break \u2013 Sagan is involved \u2013 but I can\u2019t see it lasting. \u201cMorning Dan!\u201d tweets MaliciousA \u2013 brother, I presume of Tenacious D. \u201cNot expecting a day of thrilling heroics \u2013 the smart move is for Pinot to mark Ineos, and get the stomp on tomorrow. He shouldn\u2019t risk losing any gains on the ups on the downs. JA might blow up today, that\u2019ll reduce the risk of needless fighting.\u201d Geraint Thomas was saying that he didn\u2019t expect today to be decisive because the finishes weren\u2019t climbs, but the stage is so nails it\u2019s impossible to know. Alaphilippe has climbed well so far... The front lads have absolutely battered out of the gate. Bardet, everyone reckons, will be going for it with intense kavanah. AND WE\u2019RE AWAY! Breaking news: it\u2019s hot. There\u2019s 2.6km to the official start. There are rumours that Dave Brailsford is trying to get Luke Rowe back into proceedings. Would that count as a marginal gain? This stage is the only featuring two hors-category climbs, Izoard and Galibier. Or Eddie and John-Paul, as they\u2019re known. Landa, Bardet, Yates and Nibali are favourites for today, but it\u2019s tough to focus on them when the battle for the overall is so intense. It looks gorgeous out there, though nothing on a box room in north London. Oh good, Sky Go is down. Stand by for some hot off the phone action! OK, let\u2019s do it. Hey, wake up. It\u2019s time. Wake up. Let\u2019s go. It\u2019s time. This is it. Today, we \u2013 OK, \u201cwe\u201d \u2013 begin the first of three Alpine schleps, featuring three ludicrous climbs, and without the slightest clue how things will shake down when they\u2019re all done. Julian Alaphilippe still leads the overall standings, but until these last few weeks was considered no more climber than Blonde Man is golfer, so his 1min 35sec lead over Geraint Thomas looks vulnerable \u2013 even though though Thomas\u2019s road captain was hoofed out of the race last evening. Meanwhile, Steven Kruijswijk, the magnificently menacing Thibaut Pinot, and Egan Bernal lurk with intent. This is going to be spectacular. Start: 10.30am BST, 11.30am local time",

The import of waste is a growing concern, added Kodithuwakku, who said materials were often burned in container yards in Colombo or taken to dumping grounds in populated areas. \u201cIt has been recorded continuously that [there are cases] of water-borne diseases, skin diseases and respiratory diseases because of these garbage dumps,\u201d he said. \u201cThese kinds of things still aren\u2019t properly managed by the authorities.\u201d Jayaratne said a team had been appointed to investigate the containers. \u201cWe have to send it back to the country of export very soon. We have to take action against the culprits also. We will first send the goods back and then take the action. According to the Basel convention, the country of export is responsible for the goods.\u201d The Basel convention was passed in 1989, following concerns about the dumping of hazardous waste in poorer countries. In May, an amendment to the convention stated that nations have the power to block the import of contaminated or hard-to-recycle plastic rubbish. \u201cIn the initial video that they posted on the news you could see this weird liquid \u2013 a greenish, blueish liquid \u2013 coming out of the containers and into the waterways,\u201d said Avishka Sendanayake, a consultant on climate change and sustainability. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what kind of chemical waste this is,\u201d she said. Sendanayake took part in small protests outside the British high commission in Colombo on Wednesday, demanding the UK to take back its waste. \u201cWe are still struggling to deal with waste within the country; there is no way we can deal with the waste coming in from another country,\u201d she said. In 2017, 19 people were killed, including five children, after a huge rubbish dump collapsed on to their homes in Colombo. Last year, China banned foreign plastic waste imports, causing trash to flow instead to Sri Lanka and across south-east Asia. Countries have quickly become overwhelmed and are increasingly taking a stand over the dumping of waste by foreign nations. Earlier this month, Cambodia announced it would send 1,600 tonnes of plastic waste found in shipping containers back to the US and Canada, while Indonesia said it would send back dozens of containers full of waste to France and Australia. Earlier this year, Malaysia said it would ship 450 tonnes of imported plastic waste back to its sources. A UK Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe are committed to tackling illegal waste exports, which is why individuals found to be exporting incorrectly described waste can face a two-year jail term or an unlimited fine.\u201d",

In many ways, Orange Is the New Black has proved conclusively that audiences are hungry for female-led stories, a whole lot of them, since each episode of the extremely popular series is a veritable smorgasbord of female experiences. In fact, according to a recent <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/netflix-orange-is-the-new-black-stranger-things-most-poular-1203267573/\">study</a>, it was determined to be the most popular show on Netflix, with <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/features/orange-is-the-new-black-final-season-netflix-jenji-kohan-1203270374/\">105 million subscribers</a> having tuned in to at least one episode. In this way, it didn\u2019t just normalize the success of female-led TV shows; it illustrated that a series devoted to many female stories could be compelling enough to draw in viewers from all around the globe. Heck, it was ubiquitous enough to get its own Sesame Street parody, Orange Is the New Snack, complete with a puppet version of Crazy Eyes named Googly Eyes and an adorable tagline: \u201cWe\u2019ve got time for snacks.\u201d</p> <p>Certainly, there have been successful television shows that center on a group of female characters before this one; shows such as Sex in the City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Girls have all offered compelling looks at what it means to be a woman in the world. But the Orange Is the New Black\u2019s appetite for telling multiple stories about varied female characters, many of whom come from marginalized communities, is what has ultimately made its success revolutionary. At a time when women are still often slotted into cookie-cutter categories, it spent seven years insisting that female stories are human stories and that women have just as many complicated desires as men do. You can already see echoes of its flawed and nuanced female characters in recent popular series, from Jenji Kohan\u2019s newer ensemble comedy, Glow, about a group of ragtag female TV wrestlers, to the provocative and soapy world of female secrets and obsessions on Big Little Lies, as well as the exploration of grief and its aftermath on the brilliant and acclaimed series Fleabag, all of which share a similar fascination with imperfect female characters who yearn to grow and change.</p> <p>Orange Is the New Black paved the way in allowing women on the small screen to be lovably messy, and also demonstrated how the most compelling stories are often the ones where we see female characters strive to be <em>good</em>, rather than <em>nice</em>. It\u2019s this emphasis on transformation that also makes the final season of Orange Is the New Black so satisfying. While this season brings some compelling new plot lines that tackle current political and social issues, including immigration, head-on, season seven\u2019s biggest overarching success comes from the way in which the series finishes the story arcs of many of the show\u2019s most beloved characters in ways that are both surprising and stirring. Everyone on the series may not have a happy ending, but every character, even ones that don\u2019t necessarily have a completely resolved plotline, are shown to be fully realized people: complicated, human, deserving to be heard rather than hidden away.</p> <ul> <li><p>The final season of Orange Is the New Black lands on Netflix on 26 July</p></li> </ul>",

Heck, it was ubiquitous enough to get its own Sesame Street parody, Orange Is the New Snack, complete with a puppet version of Crazy Eyes named Googly Eyes and an adorable tagline: \u201cWe\u2019ve got time for snacks.\u201d Certainly, there have been successful television shows that center on a group of female characters before this one; shows such as Sex in the City, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Girls have all offered compelling looks at what it means to be a woman in the world. But the Orange Is the New Black\u2019s appetite for telling multiple stories about varied female characters, many of whom come from marginalized communities, is what has ultimately made its success revolutionary. At a time when women are still often slotted into cookie-cutter categories, it spent seven years insisting that female stories are human stories and that women have just as many complicated desires as men do. You can already see echoes of its flawed and nuanced female characters in recent popular series, from Jenji Kohan\u2019s newer ensemble comedy, Glow, about a group of ragtag female TV wrestlers, to the provocative and soapy world of female secrets and obsessions on Big Little Lies, as well as the exploration of grief and its aftermath on the brilliant and acclaimed series Fleabag, all of which share a similar fascination with imperfect female characters who yearn to grow and change. Orange Is the New Black paved the way in allowing women on the small screen to be lovably messy, and also demonstrated how the most compelling stories are often the ones where we see female characters strive to be good, rather than nice. It\u2019s this emphasis on transformation that also makes the final season of Orange Is the New Black so satisfying. While this season brings some compelling new plot lines that tackle current political and social issues, including immigration, head-on, season seven\u2019s biggest overarching success comes from the way in which the series finishes the story arcs of many of the show\u2019s most beloved characters in ways that are both surprising and stirring. Everyone on the series may not have a happy ending, but every character, even ones that don\u2019t necessarily have a completely resolved plotline, are shown to be fully realized people: complicated, human, deserving to be heard rather than hidden away. The final season of Orange Is the New Black lands on Netflix on 26 July",

He played a vital role in helping ensure that, more than any other Arab state, the north African country preserved many of the essential gains of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/23/arab-spring-five-years-on-writers-look-back\" title=\"\">Arab spring</a> movement.</p> <p>In toppling their long-established dictator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/zine-al-abidine-ben-ali\" title=\"\">Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali</a>, in 2011, Tunisians led the way in what, for a time, appeared to be an unstoppable march towards democratic accountability across the region. Ben Ali\u2019s demise was soon followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hosni-mubarak\" title=\"\">Hosni Mubarak\u2019s</a> in Egypt and would eventually include Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Even Bashar al-Assad in Syria initially faced a pro-democracy backlash. But while any hopes of an orderly transition soon foundered in those three countries, Tunisia alone \u2013 despite the scourge of terrorism at home and the appeal of jihadism to its young men \u2013 managed to establish a functioning democracy.</p> <p>Essebsi, nicknamed \u201cthe old wolf\u201d, was already 84 when he found himself at the centre of the revolutionary upheaval in Tunis. A month after Ben Ali\u2019s flight to Saudi Arabia, Essebsi was summoned out of retirement by the acting president, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/15/tunisian-speaker-sworn-interim-president\" title=\"\">Fouad Mebazaa</a>, to serve as prime minister, a post he would hold until <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/22/tunisia-election-winners-ennahda-ettakatol\" title=\"\">elections at the end of 2011 brought the moderate Islamist Ennahda party to power</a>.</p> <p>Essebsi was an unlikely, and for many a controversial, choice to help entrench a new political system: not only had he been a loyal aide to the autocratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/apr/07/guardianobituaries1\" title=\"\">Habib Bourguiba</a>, Tunisia\u2019s \u201cfounding father\u201d and first president after independence from France, but he had \u2013 at least initially \u2013 been an ally of the by now reviled Ben Ali, who had removed Bourguiba in 1987. Despite these associations, Essebsi\u2019s reputation as a patriot and a technocrat, and the fact that he had spent the previous two decades in retirement, meant that opposition to his new prominence could be ignored.</p> <p>Serving as prime minister for the crucial year after what became known as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/17/tunisia-jasmine-revolution-editorial\" title=\"\">jasmine revolution</a> (after the national flower) might have been enough for most politicians of such an advanced age. But in April 2012, five months after stepping down, Essebsi announced the formation of Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia\u2019s Call), a \u201cbig tent\u201d secularist party opposed to the Islamists and to what he saw as the extremism and violence threatening public liberties.

      "bodyText": "Beji Caid Essebsi, who has died aged 92, was the first freely elected president of modern Tunisia. He played a vital role in helping ensure that, more than any other Arab state, the north African country preserved many of the essential gains of the Arab spring movement. In toppling their long-established dictator, Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, in 2011, Tunisians led the way in what, for a time, appeared to be an unstoppable march towards democratic accountability across the region. Ben Ali\u2019s demise was soon followed by Hosni Mubarak\u2019s in Egypt and would eventually include Muammar Gaddafi in Libya. Even Bashar al-Assad in Syria initially faced a pro-democracy backlash. But while any hopes of an orderly transition soon foundered in those three countries, Tunisia alone \u2013 despite the scourge of terrorism at home and the appeal of jihadism to its young men \u2013 managed to establish a functioning democracy. Essebsi, nicknamed \u201cthe old wolf\u201d, was already 84 when he found himself at the centre of the revolutionary upheaval in Tunis. A month after Ben Ali\u2019s flight to Saudi Arabia, Essebsi was summoned out of retirement by the acting president, Fouad Mebazaa, to serve as prime minister, a post he would hold until elections at the end of 2011 brought the moderate Islamist Ennahda party to power. Essebsi was an unlikely, and for many a controversial, choice to help entrench a new political system: not only had he been a loyal aide to the autocratic Habib Bourguiba, Tunisia\u2019s \u201cfounding father\u201d and first president after independence from France, but he had \u2013 at least initially \u2013 been an ally of the by now reviled Ben Ali, who had removed Bourguiba in 1987. Despite these associations, Essebsi\u2019s reputation as a patriot and a technocrat, and the fact that he had spent the previous two decades in retirement, meant that opposition to his new prominence could be ignored. Serving as prime minister for the crucial year after what became known as the jasmine revolution (after the national flower) might have been enough for most politicians of such an advanced age. But in April 2012, five months after stepping down, Essebsi announced the formation of Nidaa Tounes (Tunisia\u2019s Call), a \u201cbig tent\u201d secularist party opposed to the Islamists and to what he saw as the extremism and violence threatening public liberties. Controversially it included former supporters of Ben Ali. Despite this, Nidaa Tounes won the parliamentary election held under a new constitution in October 2014. Two months later, at the age of 88, Essebsi convincingly defeated the incumbent, Moncef Marzouki, a veteran human rights activist backed by Ennahda, to become Tunisia\u2019s president. While Essebsi had considerable success in holding together the fragile political process, his presidency was overshadowed by atrocities carried out in the name of Islamic State, with the resultant disastrous effect on tourism and the Tunisian economy. First came the attack on the Bardo Museum in Tunis in March 2015, in which 21 people, including many foreign tourists, were killed; then, in June, the deadly assault on a beach resort near Sousse in which 38 people, mostly Britons, lost their lives; and in November that year a suicide bombing targeting a bus containing presidential guards, with 12 fatalities. Two suicide attacks last month resulted in the death of a police officer. On top of this, the Tunisian authorities had little success in ending the country\u2019s unenviable reputation for being one of the world\u2019s biggest exporters of jihadists. They had to contend with militant groups in remote desert areas on the border with Algeria, and high unemployment continued to stoke unrest. In April this year Essebsi said that he did not intend to stand for re-election this November, wanting to make way for someone younger. Born in the northern coastal town of Sidi Bou Said, he came from a family of wealthy landowners. In 1941, with Tunisia loyal to Vichy France, he joined the youth wing of the Neo-Destour party, which had been founded a few years earlier to demand full independence from the French.

Essebsi served as foreign minister for more than five years from April 1981, a tumultuous period that included the arrival in Tunis of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) after it had been driven out of Beirut, an Israeli air attack on the PLO base and America\u2019s bombing of Libya.

I don\u2019t buy that. I don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t appreciate it. I don\u2019t \u2013 fuck that \u2026 I want the whole series to have happened, it just hasn\u2019t happened yet. No, Benedict Cumberbatch, or whatever his name is, is not Khan, alright? Khan is Khan. And I told JJ, like, \u2018I don\u2019t understand this. I don\u2019t like it.\u2019 And then he was like, \u2018Ignore it! Nobody likes it. I don\u2019t understand it. Just do whatever you want. If you want it to happen the exact way it happens on the series, it can.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It ought to come as no surprise, given the film-maker\u2019s fondness for trash cinema, that his route into the original series came through falling in love with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/william-shatner\">William Shatner</a>\u2019s Kirk. The latter\u2019s furniture-chewing performance in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnUqGTNezME\">the classic The Enemy Within episode</a> wins special praise. But despite his concerns over the timeline reboot that set up 2009\u2019s Star Trek, Tarantino also goes on to gush over Pine and Quinto\u2019s performance in that film. For the director, it seems that channelling the original series\u2019 high camp through the saga\u2019s current cast is the obvious route through the stars.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e701f1b799751c32503e7a45eddf5c2dddbf3e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e701f1b799751c32503e7a45eddf5c2dddbf3e6/0_51_4915_2949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tarantino at the Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood premiere\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Playing to the crowd \u2026Tarantino at the Once Upon a Time \u2026 in Hollywood premiere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe reason I was actually intrigued by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/08/star-trek\">the JJ Abrams version</a> of it is because I thought Chris Pine did a fantastic job not just playing Captain Kirk, but playing William Shatner\u2019s captain \u2013 he is William Shatner. He\u2019s not just another guy, he\u2019s William Shatner\u2019s Captain Kirk. And it\u2019s literally, Zachary Quinto is literally Leonard Nimoy\u2019s \u2013 because they both have the same scene together \u2013 he\u2019s his Spock. They fucking nail it. They just nail it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://deadline.com/2019/07/quentin-tarantino-once-upon-a-time-interview-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-margot-robbie-star-trek-pulp-fiction-1202647835/\">Speaking separately to Deadline</a>, Tarantino described the tone of the proposed film as \u201cPulp Fiction in space\u201d. \u201cThat Pulp Fiction-y aspect, when I read the script, I felt, I have never read a science fiction movie that has this shit in it, ever. There\u2019s no science fiction movie that has this in it. And they said, I know, that\u2019s why we want to make it. It\u2019s, at the very least, unique in that regard.\u201d</p> <p>In many ways, Tarantino\u2019s revelations throw up more questions than answers. We learn that Abrams appears to have no qualms about letting the maverick film-maker loose on the space saga with no set guidelines whatsoever. This is itself rather admirable and not a little bit exciting. It\u2019s not hard to imagine Tarantino riffing off the operatic tone of a movie such as 1982\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/dec/09/favourite-film-star-trek-wrath-khan\">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</a>, especially as we know he once tried to cast Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n as the pimp Esteban Vihaio in Kill Bill: Volume 2.</p> <p>But if QT really is allowed to make his bloodthirsty (it will certainly be R-rated) gangster space epic, where does this leave the series once he has departed? If the Tarantino take on Star Trek proves popular, do future movies continue along a similar path, potentially changing the way the franchise operates for ever? Or does this latest Star Trek movie end up being a standalone entry \u2013 perhaps like the X-Men movie Logan \u2013 a film that\u2019s simply impossible to follow on a tonal level? Let us not forget Tarantino once accused Bond rights owner Eon of refusing to let him take charge of 007 because they were \u201cafraid Quentin\u2019s going to make it too good and fuck the rest of the series\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt\">Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood review - Tarantino's dazzling LA redemption song</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The short answer is we just don\u2019t know, because nobody has given Tarantino the keys to a franchise movie before. And let\u2019s not forget the film-maker himself admits he isn\u2019t 100% certain he\u2019s going to get to the production stage. This could easily end up being added to the long list of films QT never quite got round to making <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/18/quentin-tarantino-final-film-theories-rumors\">before his 10 movies were up</a>.</p> <p>In many ways, it\u2019s remarkable that such a barmy-sounding project has even come this far. And yet given <a href=\"https://io9.gizmodo.com/chris-pine-and-chris-hemsworth-are-causing-star-trek-4-1828266742\">plans for Star Trek 4 are currently stuck</a> on the Hollywood equivalent of a backwater Romulan planet with no apparent source of dilithium crystals, it may be that QT\u2019s involvement is just about the only way to get the Starship Enterprise moving again.</p>",

For the director, it seems that channelling the original series\u2019 high camp through the saga\u2019s current cast is the obvious route through the stars. \u201cThe reason I was actually intrigued by the JJ Abrams version of it is because I thought Chris Pine did a fantastic job not just playing Captain Kirk, but playing William Shatner\u2019s captain \u2013 he is William Shatner. He\u2019s not just another guy, he\u2019s William Shatner\u2019s Captain Kirk. And it\u2019s literally, Zachary Quinto is literally Leonard Nimoy\u2019s \u2013 because they both have the same scene together \u2013 he\u2019s his Spock. They fucking nail it. They just nail it.\u201d Speaking separately to Deadline, Tarantino described the tone of the proposed film as \u201cPulp Fiction in space\u201d. \u201cThat Pulp Fiction-y aspect, when I read the script, I felt, I have never read a science fiction movie that has this shit in it, ever. There\u2019s no science fiction movie that has this in it. And they said, I know, that\u2019s why we want to make it. It\u2019s, at the very least, unique in that regard.\u201d In many ways, Tarantino\u2019s revelations throw up more questions than answers. We learn that Abrams appears to have no qualms about letting the maverick film-maker loose on the space saga with no set guidelines whatsoever. This is itself rather admirable and not a little bit exciting. It\u2019s not hard to imagine Tarantino riffing off the operatic tone of a movie such as 1982\u2019s Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, especially as we know he once tried to cast Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n as the pimp Esteban Vihaio in Kill Bill: Volume 2. But if QT really is allowed to make his bloodthirsty (it will certainly be R-rated) gangster space epic, where does this leave the series once he has departed? If the Tarantino take on Star Trek proves popular, do future movies continue along a similar path, potentially changing the way the franchise operates for ever? Or does this latest Star Trek movie end up being a standalone entry \u2013 perhaps like the X-Men movie Logan \u2013 a film that\u2019s simply impossible to follow on a tonal level? Let us not forget Tarantino once accused Bond rights owner Eon of refusing to let him take charge of 007 because they were \u201cafraid Quentin\u2019s going to make it too good and fuck the rest of the series\u201d. The short answer is we just don\u2019t know, because nobody has given Tarantino the keys to a franchise movie before. And let\u2019s not forget the film-maker himself admits he isn\u2019t 100% certain he\u2019s going to get to the production stage. This could easily end up being added to the long list of films QT never quite got round to making before his 10 movies were up. In many ways, it\u2019s remarkable that such a barmy-sounding project has even come this far. And yet given plans for Star Trek 4 are currently stuck on the Hollywood equivalent of a backwater Romulan planet with no apparent source of dilithium crystals, it may be that QT\u2019s involvement is just about the only way to get the Starship Enterprise moving again.",

      "bodyText": "Hong Kong has been rocked by a series of protests by hundreds of thousands of people in recent weeks, many of which have ended in violent clashes between police and pockets of demonstrators. The protests were initially focused on a bill that that would make it easier to extradite people to China from the semi-autonomous city. But the authorities\u2019 harsh policing of the protests, coupled with a refusal by Hong Kong\u2019s leader to completely withdraw the bill, mean protesters have returned to the streets time and again. What is the proposed extradition law? The law would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China for the first time. Supporters say the amendments are key to ensuring the city does not become a criminal refuge, but critics worry Beijing will use the law to extradite political opponents and others to China, where their legal protections cannot be guaranteed. The government claims the push to change the law, which would also apply to Taiwan and Macau, stems from the killing last year of a Hong Kong woman while she was in Taiwan with her boyfriend. Authorities in Taiwan suspect the woman\u2019s boyfriend, who remains in Hong Kong, but cannot try him because no extradition agreement is in place. Under the amended law, those accused of offences punishable by seven years or more in prison could be extradited. The new legislation would give Hong Kong\u2019s leader, known as the chief executive, authority to approve extradition requests, after review by the courts. Hong Kong\u2019s legislature, the legislative council, would not have any oversight over the extradition process. Why are Hong Kongers so angry about the bill? Many Hong Kongers fear the law would be used by authorities to target political enemies and that it would signify the end of the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d policy, eroding the civil rights enjoyed by Hong Kong residents since the handover of sovereignty from the UK to China in 1997. China has often used allegations of non-political crimes to target government critics, and there are fears that Hong Kong officials would not be able to reject Beijing\u2019s requests. Legal professionals have also expressed concern over the rights of those sent across the border to be tried. The conviction rate in Chinese courts is as high as 99%. Arbitrary detentions, torture and denial of legal representation of one\u2019s choosing are also common. What do the bill\u2019s supporters say? Supporters say the legislation is necessary to plug a \u201cloophole\u201d in the current law and protect Hong Kong from becoming a \u201chaven for international fugitives\u201d.

Hong Kong\u2019s top political leader is not elected by ordinary voters but by a 1,200-strong election committee accountable to Beijing. Half of its legislature are chosen through indirect electoral systems that favour pro-Beijing figures. Many Hong Kongers also cite the jailing of leaders and activists from the 2014 Occupy Central movement \u2013 a 79-day mass civil disobedience movement \u2013 as well as the disqualification of young localist lawmakers as signs of the erosion of civil freedoms. Resentment towards China has been intensified by soaring property prices \u2013 with increasing numbers of mainland Chinese buying properties in the city \u2013 as well as the government\u2019s \u201cpatriotic education\u201d drive, and the large numbers of mainland tourists who flock to Hong Kong.

      "bodyText": "Labour has criticised Boris Johnson after an analysis of his flagship tax plan to cut rates for higher earners found that almost 80% of the people to benefit would be men. Johnson, who chaired his first cabinet on Thursday, is still committed to raising the threshold for the 40p higher rate of tax from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. According to an earlier analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, the plan would cost about \u00a39bn a year and predominantly benefit the 10% of richest households in Britain. Labour had since commissioned research by the House of Commons library into the gender split of those who will benefit. It found that 850,000 women would gain from the increase in the threshold, against 2.9 million men, a split of 77% to 23%. This was the split for individuals rather than households. The analysis, based on the IFS study, government population estimates and the EU\u2019s Euromod tax-benefit policy simulation tool, also found that 80% of the financial benefit \u2013 the extra cash that will become available by raising the threshold \u2013 will go to men. Dawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities minister, said the plan was emblematic of Johnson\u2019s priorities. \u201cWomen have borne the brunt of austerity. But rather than fixing the inequalities that are ingrained in our economic system, Boris Johnson\u2019s plans will entrench them even further,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we design policies that benefit women as well, then everyone will be better off. A tax cut for the highest earners, the majority of them men, reveals just how misguided and out of touch Boris Johnson\u2019s priorities are.\u201d The tax plan was Johnson\u2019s first major policy announcement after he and Jeremy Hunt entered the final stage of the Conservative leadership race, where party members chose between them, and was seen as a bid for the backing of a membership that is disproportionately older and better off. It immediately faced criticism, with the Resolution Foundation thinktank saying that 83% of those who would gain from the change come from the top 10% of households by income. The thinktank calculated that someone earning \u00a380,000 a year would gain by \u00a357 a week, the same sum as that received in jobseeker\u2019s allowance by a young unemployed person. Given the response, Johnson has sought to play down the significance of the plan, saying it would form part of a wider package focusing more on helping lower earners. Johnson has said tax cuts in general are a good idea as they end up increasing revenue \u2013 an idea based on a now generally discredited economic model. However, with a working majority in the Commons of just two, in practice the higher rate tax cut seems unlikely to happen.",

So when female fans woke up last Sunday to the news of a f<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jul/22/natalie-portman-confirmed-as-mighty-thor-in-marvel-sequel\" title=\"\">emale Thor, a Black Widow movie and a bisexual Valkyrie</a>, some wondered if they were still dreaming. The announcements at San Diego Comic-Con about Phase 4 of Disney\u2019s Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) appeared to promise a more gender-balanced future.</p> <p>The most prominent was that Natalie Portman\u2019s Dr Jane Foster would take the hammer from Chris Hemsworth\u2019s Thor, becoming Mighty Thor. Social media exploded and divided, with fanboys declaring that Marvel had gone \u201cfeminist\u201d. There was an easy comeback: the Thor story is based <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/23/marvel-comics-thor-attacks-critics-feminist\" title=\"\">on an existing comic book plotline in which Foster temporarily acquires Thor\u2019s powers</a>. But the decision to use that specific story still speaks volumes. It is far less well known than the Captain Marvel series and could easily have been overlooked in favour of another story with Hemsworth front and centre, keeping Portman\u2019s character as the astrophysicist love-interest (or out of the picture entirely, which was the case in 2017\u2019s Thor: Ragnarok).</p> <p>\u201cThis shows Marvel\u2019s commitment to showing diversity and opening the universe out to all the iterations of the characters we\u2019ve seen in the comic books,\u201d says Jane Crowther, editor of <a href=\"https://www.gamesradar.com/uk/totalfilm/\" title=\"\">Total Film magazine</a>, who put Brie Larson as Captain Marvel on the cover. \u201cPhase 4 is all about new beginnings, and what better way to commit to that than really shake up Thor by bringing in a female lead?\u201d</p> <p>Others suggest a financial incentive. \u201cI think they\u2019re following the box office,\u201d says Mia Bays, director-at-large at <a href=\"https://www.birds-eye-view.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Birds Eye View Film</a>, an organisation supporting films by women. \u201cDiversity is good business. Marvel saw that with Black Panther and Captain Marvel, and we\u2019ve seen it with Wonder Woman for DC.\u201d</p> <p>Even if this were a wholly cynical decision, it is surely time that studios recognised the value of female role models in family-friendly fare, which the likes of Geena Davis have been campaigning for this for decades. Film critic Amon Warmann, who contributes to Talk Sport and Empire, thinks it\u2019s high time. \u201cMarvel caught flak \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 for being too white in the MCU\u2019s early years,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they deserve credit for being at the forefront of representation in mainstream media. The good that comes from movies such as Black Panther, not just for the movie itself but for the extremely positive effects it can have on the industry, far outweigh any perceived element of box-ticking for me.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e477b37711e327413871305007031057069e588\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e477b37711e327413871305007031057069e588/0_32_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jay Maidment/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Retaining the director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/taika-waititi\" title=\"\">Taika Waititi</a> for <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/thor-4-love-and-thunder-natalie-portman-female-thor-lgbtq-character-plot-release-date/\" title=\"\">Thor: Love and Thunder</a> is a significant move. The part-Maori New Zealander has long made films about outsiders, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/17/comedy\" title=\"\">Eagle vs Shark</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/23/hunt-for-the-wilderpeople-review-sam-neill-misfit-kid-kiwi-hit\" title=\"\">Hunt for the Wilderpeople</a>; he brought a more inclusive sensibility to Thor: Ragnarok. \u201cHe genuinely moved the Thor franchise on, in tone and storyline, so he\u2019s a safe pair of hands to move it on again into this new arena,\u201d says Crowther. She adds: \u201cI hope he reflects the storyline from the comics of Jane battling breast cancer at the same time as being a kick-ass hero. That really would be a departure.\u201d Marvel has also hired female directors for a number of projects: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/13/australian-cate-shortland-to-direct-marvels-black-widow-film\" title=\"\">the Australian Cate Shortland is helming the long-awaited Black Widow</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/jul/13/australian-cate-shortland-to-direct-marvels-black-widow-film\" title=\"\">prequel</a> starring Scarlett Johansson and Chlo\u00e9 Zhao will direct Marvel\u2019s ensemble film The Eternals, featuring Angelina Jolie and Richard Madden. This marks the first time a woman will direct a Marvel film solo, after Anna Boden co-directed Captain Marvel with Ryan Fleck.</p> <p>There may be pressure from within the MCU cast to give female actors bigger roles. A scene in Avengers: Endgame, in which the women rose up together, felt well-intentioned, but clumsy. Was it a hasty response to <a href=\"https://www.cbr.com/marvel-all-female-film-johansson-thompson/\" title=\"\">requests from the Valkyrie actor Tessa Thompson</a> to be cast directly alongside her female colleagues? A more elegant scene in Endgame appointed Valkyrie as ruler of Asgard. It was a stirring sight to see Thor, a white male born into privilege, graciously handing the baton to Valkyrie, a born leader from an underrepresented group. Now it has been confirmed that Thompson\u2019s character in Thor: Love and Thunder will honour the comic book character\u2019s bisexuality, too. Thompson, who is bisexual, is also a vocal supporter of the Time\u2019s Up movement, spearheading the \u201c4% challenge\u201d by committing to announce a female-directed project within the next 18 months. \u201cTessa Thompson, Brie Larson and Natalie Portman are all founding members of Time\u2019s Up and strong advocates of diversity and equality, with huge social media followings,\u201d says Crowther. \u201cTheir involvement in the MCU gives me hope that Marvel is doing the right thing for the right outcome.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s hope that Thompson and Portman\u2019s characters in Thor: Love and Thunder get to work together in more than a token fashion, building on the quiet bravery of the Captain Marvel film, which put female friendship at its core. Larson raved about the relationship between Carol/Captain Marvel and her friend Maria (Lashana Lynch) when I interviewed her for the Girls on Film podcast. \u201cThe great love that is lost and found in this film is with her best friend. It\u2019s such a powerful thing for me \u2026 It\u2019s weirdly new, despite it being something we all understand.\u201d</p> <p>While the Time\u2019s Up movement has doubtless fuelled the engines, these developments are not that sudden: superhero blockbusters take many years to produce. \u201cThe MCU has always been extremely pragmatic in planning and they have world-building finessed to a science, so these new films will have been a long time coming,\u201d says Crowther. And, of course, comic books can be produced much more quickly to keep up with the times, as Warmann points out. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t had the MCU introductions of Ms Marvel \u2013 a Muslim superhero \u2013 or Miles Morales, who got a lot of shine in Into the Spider-Verse last year. I haven\u2019t even mentioned characters like Jennifer \u2018She-Hulk\u2019 Walters, Amadeus Cho, and Riri Williams.\u201d</p> <p>If Marvel\u2019s plans are all based on existing comic books, why is toxic masculinity still an issue within the Marvel fan community? \u201cPossibly because of an illogical fear that stories featuring women within the MCU is a reframing of the whole Marvel universe as feminist or \u2018woke\u2019, which will, in turn, dilute, change or ruin the Phase 1 characters they love,\u201d says Crowther. But she thinks the naysayers are in a minority. \u201cAlthough they\u2019re loud, they\u2019re a pretty small group and their efforts to derail Captain Marvel\u2019s release via Rotten Tomatoes failed. And, although many of them are threatening to boycott this phase of films, there are new generations who have grown up with the MCU universe who will want to watch these stories.\u201d</p> <p>Is Marvel becoming feminist? Maybe, if feminism is about gender equality, not the female dominance the trolls are fearing. Hemsworth is still the lead in Thor: Love and Thunder and other announced Marvel films include Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. \u201cI doubt anyone at Marvel is framing this as a \u2018feminist\u2019 overhaul internally,\u201d says Bays. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing the dominant view. It\u2019s about equality for the audience in terms of choice. They\u2019re wisely refreshing the brand because it needs it and they\u2019re realising that the usual recipe \u2013 white, brawny, male-centred, world-saving super-bro \u2013 is tired and doesn\u2019t appeal to a lot of the audience. The international audience, especially, is coming out for the films that feel fresher.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hesitate to pat Marvel on the back <em>too</em> much because we had to wait 20 or so movies to get here,\u201d says Warmann. \u201cBut as the biggest thing in cinema right now, it has more of a responsibility than most to depict a world that represents its hugely diverse audience.

And these have been mounting in Europe: Not long before the ECB\u2019s announcement today, and hardly registered by market participants, the Ifo Pan Germany Business Climate Index had dropped to its lowest reading since April 2013. The danger is that investors become too complacent, relying fully on accommodative monetary policy, and ignore the late-cycle risks that are lingering in the background. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d39aab48f08cf92bb776d33\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T13:14:27.234Z\">2.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>What will Mario Draghi do after his term ends on 31 October?</strong></p> <p>I haven\u2019t come to a determination, he says, rather boringly.<br></p> <p>He\u2019s slightly more interesting on his successor, former International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde.</p> <p>I think she will be an \u201coutstanding president of the ECB\u201d, Draghi says.<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d39a9b68f0845f89e3142d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T13:09:26.770Z\">2.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The euro is back at about $1.117 against the US dollar, as Draghi sounds less dovish than the statement suggested.</strong><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/kenzyxvw/status/1154376646784241664\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUR?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#EUR</a> is taking back gains as Draghi continues to sound less dovish than expected today.

      "bodyText": "Mario Draghi has played today\u2019s ECB announcement pretty much exactly in line with the consensus: signal stimulative rate cuts for the future, while holding back for now. The ECB president worked hard to sound a bit more hawkish in today\u2019s press conference. You can see how that played out in the reaction of stock markets, which initially rose before falling back. The FTSE 100 has now lost 0.4% today. Draghi put the cat amongst the pigeons by saying that the ECB had not discussed cutting rates at this meeting, perhaps contradicting some over-eager traders betting on an immediate loosening of policy. Stocks are on the slide across Europe, with Germany\u2019s Dax benchmark down by more than 1% for the day at the time of writing. Draghi\u2019s comments supported the euro, which bounced back off two-year lows. Yet the overall message (well telegraphed in advance) was clear: the central bank is ready to offer support on multiple fronts to support growth. Manufacturing in particular is not looking healthy, Draghi said, even if he stopped short of predicting a recession. Claus Vistesen, chief Eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: We are very confident that today\u2019s message from the central bank is that they\u2019ll do more [to stimulate the economy]. In effect, Mr. Draghi\u2019s comments today can be summed up in the shift from the idea that the ECB is \u201ccommitted to act\u201d to the position that it is now \u201cdetermined to act,\u201d not to mention the repeated reference to the fact that ECB governors \u201cdo not like what they\u2019re seeing in the inflation data.\u201d Rupert Thompson, head of research at Kingswood, an investment manager, said: The ECB left policy unchanged at today\u2019s meeting and all but committed itself to easing at its meeting in September. Draghi emphasised that the risks to growth remain on the downside, inflation remains muted and the 2% inflation target is symmetric - implying that an overshoot would be tolerated to compensate for past undershooting. There was a fair bit of talk about fiscal support being needed to support growth \u2013 a not-so-subtle dig at serial surplus-runner Germany, perhaps? And finally, if the heat is stirring apocalyptic feelings, here\u2019s some good (if overdue) news: Thanks for joining us today, and please come back tomorrow for more economics, business and markets news as Britain continues to bake. JJ As Draghi finished speaking US stock markets moved lower at the open. The Nasdaq composite fell by 0.36%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.14% and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.04%. \u201cI am not available\u201d to swap roles with Christine Lagarde to become the head of the International Monetary Fund, Draghi says. It\u2019s not an issue. And in response to US President Donald Trump\u2019s complaints about \u201ccurrency manipulation\u201d, Draghi says he does not target the exchange rate as part of his mandate. A question on Libra, Facebook\u2019s planned digital currency. Draghi was clearly prepared for it, as he read a long list of concerns from his notes. Libra was not an issue for the governing council but was discussed quite extensively in the G7, Draghi says. There was a pretty unanimous view that there were concerns as well as interest. They were: cybersecurity, anti-money laundering, terrorism, criminal use, privacy, tax evasion, monetary policy transmission, financial stability and the possibility of changes to the global payments system. These need to be addressed before regulators will allow Libra, Draghi says. That\u2019s quite the to-do list for Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg. A year ago many economists thought Draghi would leave Frankfurt with his first rate hike. That has been proven almost certainly wrong, but there might still be some action before he leaves. Wolfgang Bauer, fixed income manager at M&amp;G Investment, said: Mario Draghi\u2019s ECB presidency is likely to end not with a whimper but a bang. After revising forward guidance today, an interest rate cut at the ECB\u2019s upcoming monetary policy meeting in September seems highly likely. In addition, the odds of a revival of net asset purchases have increased significantly. Market reactions once again proved that central banks currently trump any economic woes. And these have been mounting in Europe: Not long before the ECB\u2019s announcement today, and hardly registered by market participants, the Ifo Pan Germany Business Climate Index had dropped to its lowest reading since April 2013. The danger is that investors become too complacent, relying fully on accommodative monetary policy, and ignore the late-cycle risks that are lingering in the background. What will Mario Draghi do after his term ends on 31 October? I haven\u2019t come to a determination, he says, rather boringly. He\u2019s slightly more interesting on his successor, former International Monetary Fund boss Christine Lagarde. I think she will be an \u201coutstanding president of the ECB\u201d, Draghi says. The euro is back at about $1.117 against the US dollar, as Draghi sounds less dovish than the statement suggested. The recession risk is still pretty low, Draghi says, pointing to high employment and other factors which boost spending. However, manufacturing is struggling, he acknowledges, with spillovers to other sectors of the economy. If the worsening outlook continues fiscal policy support will be needed, Draghi says. *A previous post was edited to correct a typo. Please refresh to see the correct version. We want to see the next projections before taking action, Draghi says. That sets September as a clear date for any move. Such complex action (interest rate cuts, quantitative easing, and a possible \u201ctiering\u201d system, which excludes some banks from certain rate cuts to protect them from costly negative rates) need a lot of preparation, he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t like what we see on the inflation front,\u201d Draghi says, talking about the new \u201csymmetry\u201d commitment which would allow them to look past a temporary bump in headline inflation. There is no cap at 2% inflation, he says. The governing council will act with the same determination whether inflation is above or below the 2% target, he adds. There was no discussion of cutting rates as soon as today, Draghi says. Some of the governing council had different answers on different parts of the package, Draghi says (but they eventually converged). First question finally done. The lingering uncertainty on various geopolitical questions is itself a realisation of one of the risks to growth, Draghi says. He goes through the statement in some more detail, emphasising the easing bias in the notes. There is \u201ca consistent degree of optionality\u201d in the statement, he says. If the medium term inflation outlook falls short, the ECB is determined to act, he says, pointing to new developments in their thinking. With muted inflation, that spells rate cuts. Was the decision unanimous to pre-announce an interest rate cut in September? There was \u201cbroad agreement\u201d on the assessment of the current economic outlook, Draghi says. The outlook is getting \u201cworse and worse in manufacturing especially\u201d, Draghi says, in a nod to recent data showing the German economy is struggling. Trade wars and, bingo, a hard Brexit, are also risks to the outlook, he says. Past projections suggested there would be a rebound in the second half of the year; this is less likely now, he says. Summing up his opening statement, Draghi makes it clear that loose policy is here to stay, and follows with his standard call for some help from governments on the fiscal side. \u201cAn ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary\u201d to support the European economy Draghi says. He asks for a more growth-friendly balance of fiscal policies. And now on to the questions. The euro hit that two-year low mark before Draghi started speaking. It traded as low as $1.1100 against the US dollar. The risks remain tilted to the downside because of geopolitical uncertainties, Draghi says. Underlying inflation remains generally muted, Draghi says. Inflation expectations have fallen, so there is more need for support from monetary policy, Draghi says. Somewhat lower growth is coming in the second and third quarters of the year, he adds. You can watch him live here, by the way: Draghi (who is in Frankfurt at the ECB\u2019s headquarters) reads out the governing council\u2019s monetary policy statement. And now for his more specific comments. New information indicates that softening global growth dynamics and weak international trade are still weighing on the economic outlook, Draghi says. He also cites protectionism and emerging market issues \u2013 and highlights the weakness in the manufacturing sector. Mario Draghi is about to answer questions. Expect a lot of trying to catch him out on the timing and mix of stimulus measures. Hetal Mehta, senior European Economist at Legal &amp; General Investment Management, said: The European Central Bank (ECB) might have disappointed those looking for an immediate rate cut after the spate of weak sentiment data, but their statement of intent is clear: easing is coming, and soon. A tiered deposit rate, more QE and rate cuts are all options on the menu; Draghi and the rest of the Governing Council are trying to show that they have not run out of tools. Shoring up their credibility is clearly a key priority and they cannot deny any longer that inflation expectations are de-anchored*. *This post has been edited to correct a typo. It previously read \u201canchored\u201d rather than \u201cde-anchored\u201d. The euro is just a whisker shy of two-year lows against the US dollar. It traded as low as $1.1107 in the aftermath of the announcement. If it breaks below $1.1106 it will be the lowest level since May 2017 by my reckoning \u2013 tantalisingly close (if almost entirely of symbolic value). The pound is now up by 0.3% against the euro for the day. It\u2019s all ECB-driven: against the US dollar sterling is still flat. An important update: Thoughts at the press conference (due in about 20 minutes) will turn to what mix of stimulus measures Draghi et al. will consider necessary at the September meeting. \u201cThe ECB is loading its bazooka, but with what?\u201d asks Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. As we have persistently noted, the ECB never pre-commits. But this is as close at it gets. Further easing is on the way. But what kind? We are fairly certain that deposit rate cuts are coming, but today\u2019s initial statement points towards a combination of rate cuts and QE. We are sure that Mr. Draghi will be quizzed intensely about this balance, and options, in the press conference. Demand for UK government debt has increased, with the yield on the 10-year gilt falling to its lowest level since September 2016. The yield on the benchmark bond fell to a low of 0.65%. Yields move inversely to prices. Some reaction from economists is now coming through. Ana Andrade, analyst at the Economist intelligence Unit, said it has \u201claid the ground for a cut, but will wait for September to implement further stimulus \u2013 which will then be backed by hard data and fresh macroeconomic projections.\u201d Weak economic momentum and rising deflation risk, as measured by the substantial de-anchoring of inflation expectations over the past few months, call for further action. The press release reveals a much more dovish stance than expected. Up until now the re-start of QE remained a vague possibility. But the ECB\u2019s decision to task the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options for further stimulus, and the formal reinforcement of the ECB\u2019s commitment to the symmetry in its inflation aim leave no room for doubt about the ECB\u2019s willingness to act. Whether by re-starting QE or by substantially cutting the deposit rate. There could be more quantitative easing on the way, with ECB economists in Frankfurt tasked with looking at options to \u201creinforce\u201d its interest rates actions. The ECB\u2019s statement said: The Governing Council has tasked the relevant Eurosystem Committees with examining options, including ways to reinforce its forward guidance on policy rates, mitigating measures, such as the design of a tiered system for reserve remuneration, and options for the size and composition of potential new net asset purchases. The euro briefly bounced higher, but has now hit another two-month low of $1.1118 against the US dollar. Read the ECB\u2019s full statement here. There is some strong guidance on the future path of interest rates, however. Policy will remain \u201chighly accommodative\u201d for \u201ca prolonged period of time\u201d. The Governing Council also underlined the need for a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy for a prolonged period of time, as inflation rates, both realised and projected, have been persistently below levels that are in line with its aim. Accordingly, if the medium-term inflation outlook continues to fall short of its aim, the Governing Council is determined to act, in line with its commitment to symmetry in the inflation aim. It therefore stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner. The ECB\u2019s governing council has voted to leave interest rates unchanged. From its statement: At today\u2019s meeting the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) decided that the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.40% respectively. The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present or lower levels at least through the first half of 2020, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to its aim over the medium term. A reminder: the 12:45pm BST announcement will be followed by the press conference led by ECB president Mario Draghi at 1:30pm BST. You will be able to watch the ECB\u2019s webcast of the press conference at this link. So a quick round-up as we prepare for the announcement: the euro is now flat for the day against the US dollar. Sterling is up by about 0.14% against the euro and the dollar. Borrowing costs have been driven lower in expectation of more stimulus. The yield on the German 10-year hit a new all-time low of -0.443% this morning, as investor demand for bonds increased in the expectation of looser monetary policy. Yields move inversely to prices. With barely 10 minutes left until the ECB\u2019s announcement, perhaps they will take a leaf from Turkey\u2019s book? Its central bank has slashed the key interest deeply, by 4.25 percentage points, in a first monetary policy meeting under its new governor. The interest rate was cut on Thursday to 19.75% from 24%, the Associated Press reports. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan dismissed the previous governor, Murat Cetinkaya, on July 6 over disagreements on interest rate cuts and reiterated his belief that interest rates are \u201cthe mother of all evil.\u201d Cetinkaya was replaced by Murat Uysal, the deputy governor. The largest carmaker in Britain, Jaguar Land Rover, lost \u00a3395m in the second quarter of the year after a sales slump. Global sales fell by 11.6% year-on-year in the three months to 30 June, JLR said. Revenues for the quarter were \u00a35.1bn, a 2.8% year-on-year decline. JLR, which is owned by India\u2019s Tata Motors, blamed \u201cweaker market conditions\u201d as well as the Brexit-related shutdown of factories in April. Brexit also delayed its emissions certifications, it added. Ralf Speth, Jaguar Land Rover chief executive, said: Jaguar Land Rover is in a period of major transformation. We are simplifying our business, delivering on our product strategy and adapting to the tough market environment. We will build on our strong foundations and increased operating efficiency to return to profit this fiscal year. Jacob Rees-Mogg, newly appointed leader of the house of commons, has resigned from his role at a London-headquartered hedge fund, according to the London Evening Standard. Rees-Mogg is a co-founder at Somerset Capital Management, and has earned hundreds of thousands of pounds as a partner at the firm. He was paid about \u00a315,000 per month for 30 hours\u2019 work every month for the past year, according to the latest register of members\u2019 interests. The firm last year gained notoriety after it set up an investment fund in Ireland and warned prospective clients about the financial dangers of a hard Brexit. Boris Johnson has promised to make the UK the \u201cgreatest place on earth\u201d in his first statement to the house of commons. Quite the echo of another blond world leader (and no mention of extraterrestrial ambitions from earlier in the week). Michael Gove is in charge of no-deal planning \u2013 what the Brexit department will be doing is unclear. A lot of spending plans: more money for the National Health Service; 20,000 new police officers; more funding for schools. And tax cuts as well, although sparse on the detail so far. On migration, he points to an Australian points-based system, but says EU nationals will have a right to remain in the UK. You can follow in a lot more detail with the Guardian\u2019s Andrew Sparrow on the politics live blog: With the ECB and the US Federal Reserve both looking to cut interest rates, what is the Bank of England up to? Not much, for the moment, appears to be the answer. The Bank\u2019s rate-setting monetary policy committee meets next week (ahead of Thursday\u2019s announcement) but will stick to its \u201csolitary policy path\u201d, according to Martin Beck at Oxford Economics, a consultancy. A 9-0 vote to hold rates steady is on the cards he says \u2013 with no change to its guidance that it will raise interest rates where other central bankers are reacting to a slowing global economy. A new PM, a likely shift in fiscal policy and continued Brexit uncertainty give the MPC good cause to continue a wait-and-see approach and leave the possibility of tighter policy until well into 2020. Amid further signs of dovishness from the US Fed and the European Central Bank, the monetary policy committee is likely to leave the BoE the odd one out among major central banks And here are the CBI retail figures in chart form. This is a percentage balance, so 42% of the surveyed retailers report a fall in sales compared to 26% who say sales have risen \u2013giving a balance of -16%. There are only 46 retailers in the survey, so these figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, but they represent a large proportion of total British retailing. Retail sales fell for the third consecutive month in the year to July, marking the longest period of decline since 2011, according to the latest distributive trades survey by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). Weakness in sales from the department stores, clothing and other normal goods (e.g., jewellery, flowers) were the main driver of the weakness, although grocery sales improved. Online sales growth remains below the long-run average, despite something of a bounce back in July, and is expected to edge lower in the year to August. Rain Newton-Smith, CBI chief economist, said: Whilst last year\u2019s summer strength in retail sales is driving some of the comparative weakness this year, it is still hugely concerning that sales have fallen for the longest period in almost eight years. Despite the recent pick-up we\u2019ve seen in households\u2019 real earnings, the sun is clearly not shining on the British High Street. The UK economy has reached a fork in the road. The new Prime Minister must now do everything in his power to achieve a good Brexit deal, thus protecting jobs and our economy. A quick currencies update: there\u2019s not much happening. The pound is basically flat against the euro (at about \u20ac1.12) and the US dollar (still below $1.25). The euro is remaining within the range of today\u2019s movement so far, slightly above the two-month lows hit earlier. Another interesting intervention from Gerard Lyons, tipped by some to be a contender to be the next governor of the Bank of England. Lyons \u2013 a former chief economist at Standard Chartered bank, and a rare Brexit-backing economist \u2013 has downplayed his chances of getting the nod for the job from the Treasury, but he has advised Boris Johnson on economics in the past, meaning his views could be a useful bellwether for the approach of the new administration. Both Johnson and his new chancellor, Sajid Javid, have given signs that they might be willing to borrow more to fund increased spending and tax cuts for the higher paid. (David Cameron and George Osborne\u2019s long-term economic plan\u2122 (that insisted on the need for deficit reduction above all else) appears to be becoming something of an historical curiosity.) \u201cThere is scope, in an environment where nominal GDP is rising, real interest rates are low, for the government to actually borrow more in a credible way,\u201d Lyons told BBC radio in an interview, via Reuters. As we have seen in recent years, the fiscal numbers have improved. And even though in the near term there will be some uncertainty associated with leaving the EU, I think there is more room for manoeuvre. Here\u2019s one of the consequences of Draghi\u2019s \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d monetary policy support: Germany\u2019s Dax benchmark equity index has almost doubled during his time in office. (It\u2019s the ninth anniversary of the \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d speech tomorrow \u2013 which took place in London\u2019s Lancaster House. Look at the run of green in the second half of 2012.) Could the Ifo survey have influenced the ECB\u2019s monetary policy decision? Jack Allen-Reynolds, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said: We still suspect that the ECB will wait until September before cutting interest rates, but the chance of a cut today has increased. The case for it to wait until September to cut interest rates remains fairly strong. By then, it will have Q2 GDP data and a new set of economic forecasts. But an interest rate cut this afternoon would not be a huge surprise. He includes another useful chart showing why economists pay such close heed to the Ifo survey. Note how the Ifo line runs ahead of the GDP figures. The European economic \u201comens aren\u2019t great\u201d, says Kit Juckes, chief global FX strategist at French investment bank Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and the ECB may struggle to come up with the power to stimulate ailing European industry. In 2012 Mario Draghi famously promised to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to help the eurozone economy and preserve the euro, but the days of a policy \u201cbazooka\u201d in the form of quanititative easing bond buying are over, Juckes says: In truth, the ECB is down to a couple of pea-shooters. The days of \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d are long gone. Fiscal policy needs to engage. We\u2019ll take our cue from the bond market, but I doubt that anything the ECB does/says provides much comfort. A helpful chart here from Nadia Gharbi, an economist at Pictet Wealth Management: Germany is looking at a structural decline in the performance of its powerhouse manufacturing industry, some economists are saying. \u201cStill no silver linings for the German economy,\u201d says Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, the investment bank. All in all, the German economy is currently at a dangerous crossroads. The powerful recession insurance, domestic demand, is crumbling. Against the background of constantly weakening sentiment, it is doubtful whether domestic demand could rebound without external support, i.e. fiscal stimulus or trade relief. There are some punchy statements on a possible German recession coming through after the Ifo survey. VP Bank analyst Thomas Gitzel, via Reuters, said: The most important German economic indicator suggests that the German economy is heading towards a recession. More Reuters from Ifo president Clemens Fuest: the German economy is navigating troubled waters and companies are less satisfied with their current business situation. The Ifo sub-index for the manufacturing sector posted its biggest drop since February 2009 \u2013 the height of the financial crisis. That echoes purchasing managers\u2019 index data yesterday which also had economists talking of a recession risk. The euro just hit its lowest level since the end of May, with all the signs pointing towards monetary easing to come from the European Central Bank. Looser monetary policy generally correlates with a less valuable currency. With investors all but certain that the ECB has rate cuts in its sights, the main question is when and how fast the cuts will come. Against the US dollar the euro is down by 0.1%, and it previously hit lows of $1.1120 last seen on 30 May. It will be too late for the ECB\u2019s interest rates decision, but the latest measure of German business confidence from the influential Ifo Institute shows that morale has sagged more than expected in July. The closely followed measure fell to a reading of 95.7 \u2013 well below the consensus expectations of 97.1. Given the barrage of economic data suggesting that the European economy is weakening, the Ifo survey was never going to be the tipping point, but it gives another reason for Mario Draghi to strike a dovish tone in the press conference later. Boris Johnson is planning to set out his \u201cpriorities for government\u201d in his first appearance as prime minister in the house of commons \u2013 at about 10:30am BST. Perhaps he can shed some more light on what will be happening by 31 October, the Brexit deadline. People in the UK are braced for the continued heatwave, but predicted temperatures of 39 degrees Celsius will be good news for one company: Unilever. The consumer goods giant, which makes brands such as Ben &amp; Jerry\u2019s, Magnum and Popsicle ice creams, today reported that it was held back by the rain as it reported weaker than expected sales growth. It said: Market growth in Europe and North America was held back by the impact of weather on ice cream sales. At the other end of the scale to Nissan, Volkswagen has bucked the recent trend of struggling carmakers with a 30% jump in operating profits in the second quarter. While sales fell, the German carmaker managed to increase its market share as it focused on SUVs, the increasingly popular vehicles which also happen to have higher profit margins. Operating profit came in at \u20ac5.13bn (\u00a34.6bn) for the quarter, up from \u20ac3.94bn in the same period last year. In the first six months of the current financial year, the sales revenues of the Volkswagen Group grew by 4.9% to \u20ac125.2bn compared with the first half of 2018. VW has gone through the wringer in recent years after its \u201cdieselgate\u201d scandal, in which it cheated in emissions tests. However, it has recently performed better than expected in a tough environment. Frank Witter, the VW board member responsible for finance, said: In the first half of the year, the Volkswagen Group performed very well in a generally weaker overall market. The development of sales revenue and profit in the first six months is gratifying. We also confirm our outlook for the Volkswagen Group for the year as a whole. Meanwhile, Metro Bank\u2019s shares are down by 16% after hitting a record low this morning following the resignation of founder Vernon Hill as chairman last night. Metro Bank has been under the cosh in recent months after a mischaracterisation of loans was found by the Bank of England. That error was compounded by a response that raised questions over the governance of the lender. Hill will still hold a non-executive director role at the company he founded in 2010. Cobham shares have surged by 35% after the bid from private equity firm Advent. Japanese carmaker Nissan has announced 12,500 job cuts worldwide \u2013 more than the 10,000 previously reported \u2013 as profits plunged by 98.5% in the first quarter of its 2019 financial year. Operating profit fell to only 1.6bn Japanese yen (\u00a311.8m), from 109bn yen the previous year, Nissan said. Revenue dropped by 12.7% in its first financial quarter to 2.4bn Japanese yen. In its statement Nissan did not say whether its Sunderland plant would be affected by the job cuts, although the BBC reported yesterday that this was not thought likely by union sources. Nissan will reduce its global production capacity by 10% by the end of the 2022 fiscal year. In line with production optimizations, the company will reduce headcount by roughly 12,500. Furthermore, the company will reduce the size of its product lineup by at least 10% by the end of fiscal year 2022 in order to improve product competitiveness by focusing investment on global core models and strategic regional models. The FTSE 100 has risen by 0.2% at the opening bell. Top risers include ITV for a second day and miner Anglo American \u2013 although neither has gained more than 2% in early trading. Across Europe, the Euro Stoxx 600 is up by 0.6%, led by France\u2019s Cac 40, up 0.7%, and Italy\u2019s FTSE MIB, up by 0.35%. Germany\u2019s Dax gained 0.4%. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Boris Johnson has started his reign as prime minister with a brutal cabinet cull. He promised on Tuesday to steal leadership rival Jeremy Hunt\u2019s ideas, but he did not want him in his cabinet. In the top jobs are chancellor Sajid Javid, home secretary Priti Patel and foreign secretary Dominic Raab. Keen Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom is head of the business department, and will likely strike a somewhat different tone to predecessor Greg Clark. \u201cRevenge\u201d is the word on our main story this morning. You can read about it in all its gory detail here, as Britain prepares for what could be the hottest day ever. Barring any early interventions on Brexit from Johnson (and it\u2019s tricky to see at this point how he could take a harder line on a no-deal Brexit than he already has) the major economic news for the day will almost certainly be the European Central Bank\u2019s latest monetary policy announcement. And, oh, how times change. A year ago most economists believed that ECB president Mario Draghi would preside over at least one interest rate hike during his time in the chair. Now those same economists are weighing whether the ECB\u2019s rate-setting governing council will today signal an intention to cut interest rates at its next meeting in September \u2013 or whether it could take the plunge today with a new round of economic stimulus. \u201cThe case for further ECB easing was reinforced yesterday by the release of weaker than expected eurozone PMI surveys for July,\u201d said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG Bank. It is another disappointing signal for the ECB whohad previously hoped that growth would begin to pick up in the second half of this year. They are now becoming increasingly resigned to a more protracted economic slowdown. The ECB response could involve a smaller rate cut than usual, and even a reacceleration of quantitative easing, the bond purchases which have been such a big feature of monetary policy in the last decade. Draghi leaves the ECB on 31 October, meaning he will probably have gone through eight years in which the central bank has provided constant stimulus to the eurozone economy. Back in the UK, there is some big corporate news in the defence sector, as Cobham \u2013 the Dorset-based maker of military and civilian aerospace systems \u2013 is snapped up by US private equity group Advent International for \u00a34bn. The 165p per share offer represents a 50.3% premium to the average share price for the last three months.

      "body": "<p>At a time when the egotism and idiocy of a generation of private schoolboys threatens to plunge Britain beneath the waves, there is something strangely comforting about Fire Emblem: Three Houses, a fantasy role-playing game in which you essentially train up a bunch of budding Etonians on behalf of the Spanish Inquisition. Set in the \u201colde worlde\u201d of F\u00f3dlan, the game casts you as a young professor at Garreg Mach Monastery, a warlike religious school for the offspring of princes from three rival nations.</p> <p>Over the course of an 80-hour plot (with the option to play through twice more for different outcomes), you\u2019ll side with the ruler-to-be of one country, hone a class of privileged whelps into fearsome warriors, and unravel a conspiracy involving diabolical relics and ancient gods. Oh, and there\u2019s a peculiar girl trapped in your subconscious mind who gives you the power to rewind time when battles run awry. It\u2019s quite the epic, and takes a while to get into its stride, but once you\u2019ve acclimatised to its baroque mixture of boarding school daydream and turn-based strategy, Fire Emblem: Three Houses absolutely sings.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kymq4y_PGIQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kymq4y_PGIQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The story unfolds according to an academic calendar, each month concluding with a battle, and it\u2019s up to you how spend that time. You can hold classes, tutoring your pupils individually to work on particular skills and setting group assignments like cleaning out the stables. You can wander the sumptuous campus, socialising with students and faculty members, chasing down the owners of lost items, weaselling out optional quests and indulging in a spot of fishing or gardening.</p> <p>It is a slice-of-life game with a mercenary edge. You\u2019ll throw tea parties, buy gifts from the market and butter people up with chitchat, all with a view to boosting each student\u2019s motivation. You\u2019ll put the most advanced through exams to unlock new character classes and skill sets, from archers to Wyvern Knights.

      "bodyText": "At a time when the egotism and idiocy of a generation of private schoolboys threatens to plunge Britain beneath the waves, there is something strangely comforting about Fire Emblem: Three Houses, a fantasy role-playing game in which you essentially train up a bunch of budding Etonians on behalf of the Spanish Inquisition. Set in the \u201colde worlde\u201d of F\u00f3dlan, the game casts you as a young professor at Garreg Mach Monastery, a warlike religious school for the offspring of princes from three rival nations. Over the course of an 80-hour plot (with the option to play through twice more for different outcomes), you\u2019ll side with the ruler-to-be of one country, hone a class of privileged whelps into fearsome warriors, and unravel a conspiracy involving diabolical relics and ancient gods. Oh, and there\u2019s a peculiar girl trapped in your subconscious mind who gives you the power to rewind time when battles run awry. It\u2019s quite the epic, and takes a while to get into its stride, but once you\u2019ve acclimatised to its baroque mixture of boarding school daydream and turn-based strategy, Fire Emblem: Three Houses absolutely sings. The story unfolds according to an academic calendar, each month concluding with a battle, and it\u2019s up to you how spend that time. You can hold classes, tutoring your pupils individually to work on particular skills and setting group assignments like cleaning out the stables. You can wander the sumptuous campus, socialising with students and faculty members, chasing down the owners of lost items, weaselling out optional quests and indulging in a spot of fishing or gardening. It is a slice-of-life game with a mercenary edge. You\u2019ll throw tea parties, buy gifts from the market and butter people up with chitchat, all with a view to boosting each student\u2019s motivation. You\u2019ll put the most advanced through exams to unlock new character classes and skill sets, from archers to Wyvern Knights. You might also kindle a romance with one of your disciples, a slightly queasy prospect even though nothing goes beyond flirting until everybody graduates \u2013 and not helped by the odd sleazy or infantilising scene involving female characters. Above all, you will sift through ream upon ream of dialogue. There are dozens of characters in Three Houses, and they each boast a novella\u2019s worth of dialogue. The Teflon-coated aristo with a rose in his lapel; the opera diva who needs booze to get through the day; the class lech; the low-born girl trying to marry into wealth \u2013 there are so many personalities to unravel and, while there are awkward notes the script is crisp and colourful, done full justice by energetic panto voice-acting. In battle, you move your pupils around a grid, not just matching the right skill set to enemy (wielders of black magic fare well against hulking knights in armour) but ensuring that fighters are paired with their best mates. Combat in Three Houses lacks the puzzle-game immediacy of previous Fire Emblems: positioning feels less vital, and there\u2019s no longer a simple rock-paper-scissors relationship between types of weapon.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s first speech as prime minister in the House of Commons touched on a number of policy platforms, many of which had the hallmarks of future election pledges. Here\u2019s what the new PM promised.</p> \n<h2>Brexit and the backstop</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>A time limit is not enough. If an agreement is to be reached it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop.</p> \n <p>For our part we are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is a very tight corner for Johnson to have painted himself into. He is demanding the complete removal of the backstop and for all arrangements for the Irish border to be negotiated during the transition period as part of the future relationship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"075160a8-df5b-414e-9ded-8d65679a8584\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZAjoWC2pVoc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Only on Wednesday, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cI got the impression that he wasn\u2019t just talking about deleting the backstop, he was talking about a whole new deal\u2026 That is not going to happen. Any suggestion that there can be a whole new deal negotiated in weeks or months is totally not in the real world.\u201d</p> \n<h2>No deal</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>We will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research.</p> \n <p>We will prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country\u2019s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Gove has been tasked in government with ramping up no-deal preparations but Johnson suggests this will go well beyond finding more warehouse capacity or queueing systems at Dover.</p> \n<p>It has previously been reported a Johnson emergency budget could include an overhaul of stamp duty, abolishing the levy on homes worth less than \u00a3500,000, and raising the threshold for businesses\u2019 annual investment allowance. The allowance allows businesses to cut their tax bill by writing off the cost of investment, such as machinery.</p> \n<h2>NHS</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Mr Speaker, I am committed to making sure that the NHS receives the funds that were promised \u2026 This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness. I have asked officials to provide policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Both Johnson and his new senior adviser Dominic Cummings have been keen to ensure that the Vote Leave promise of \u00a3350m a week for the NHS is delivered and Cummings has been reported to be keen to focus on health in his role.</p> \n<p>It is an area where the Conservatives are likely to be hugely outflanked by Labour \u2013 but the pledge for 20 hospital upgrades sounds like a retail-friendly, election-ready promise that voters will find easy to grasp.</p> \n<h2>Crime</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>To address the rise of violent crime in our country I have announced that there will be 20,000 extra police keeping us safe over the next three years.</p> \n <p>We will give greater powers for the police to use stop and search to help tackle violent crime. I have also tasked officials to draw up proposals to ensure that in future those found guilty of the most serious sexual and violent offences are required to serve a custodial sentence.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Another pledge which sounds distinctly like it could form part of an election campaign. Polling shows public concern about violent crime is rising and Johnson has been a campaigner for increased stop and search unlike his predecessor who examined the evidence as home secretary and introduced stricter rules to stop the blanket-targeting of minority communities.</p> \n<p>As home secretary, Sajid Javid then overturned two reforms made by May, allowing officers in seven regions to step up stop-and-search.</p> \n<h2>Environment</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Our United Kingdom of 2050 will no longer make any contribution whatsoever to the destruction of our precious planet brought about by carbon emissions \u2013 because we will have led the world in delivering that net zero target.</p> \n <p>We will be the home of electric vehicles \u2013 cars, even planes, powered by British-made battery technology being developed right here, right now.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>The Conservatives \u2013 and in particular Michael Gove in Defra \u2013 have tried to make the environment a key policy platform, primarily because it is a major international issue but also because it is largely uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged by any opposition parties. It is also a major passion of his partner, Carrie Symonds, who championed animal welfare and anti-plastic campaigns in her role at CCHQ.</p> \n<p>However, it is notable that although it is the issue that Johnson mentions first in detail \u2013 he goes no further than the Theresa May government had already promised.</p> \n<h2>GM foods</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>A bioscience sector liberated from anti genetic modification rules\u2026 we will be the seedbed for the most exciting and most dynamic business investments on the planet.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Genetically modified foods are not grown commercially in the UK but a limited number can be imported. There are no fresh GM fruit or vegetables approved for consumption by humans in the EU \u2013 but Johnson hints that could change after Brexit.</p> \n<p>It is a strange policy platform for Johnson to launch on his first few days in the job, <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2014/02/21/many-britain-remain-sceptical-gm-foods\">polls show that 41% of UK adults feel negatively about GM foods</a>, compared to 17% who feel positive \u2013 though few polls have been conducted in recent years to measure how attitudes might have changed.</p> \n<h2>Education</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I have listened to the concerns of many colleagues and we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this parliament.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is not only a matter of major public concern but school funding was hugely damaging for many Conservative MPs in the 2017 election and an under-reported reason for the Conservatives\u2019 heavy losses.</p> \n<p>In his election campaign, he pledged \u00a350m to raise per-pupil funding in all secondary schools to \u00a35,000, which was ridiculed as equivalent to a 0.1% rise in the schools budget. This was later increased to a pledge of \u00a34.6bn more by 2022. The IFS has estimated \u00a34.9bn is needed to reverse cuts and protect current budgets.</p> \n<h2>Immigration</h2> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I am clear that our immigration system must change. For years, politicians have promised the public an Australian-style points based system.</p> \n <p>And today I will actually deliver on those promises \u2013 I will ask the migration advisory committee to conduct a review of that system as the first step in a radical rewriting of our immigration system.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>It is unclear what these reforms would actually mean, apart from a change for incoming EU citizens. The UK already has a points-based system for non-EEA migrants, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, where eligibility is determined by a set of mandatory criteria to which a fixed number of symbolic points are attached.</p> \n<p>A Commons library paper on the system, published in 2018, said: \u201cCalls for the UK to adopt a system closer to the \u2018Australian model\u2019 have persisted, although it has not always been obvious what advocates specifically have in mind.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s first speech as prime minister in the House of Commons touched on a number of policy platforms, many of which had the hallmarks of future election pledges. Here\u2019s what the new PM promised. Brexit and the backstop A time limit is not enough. If an agreement is to be reached it must be clearly understood that the way to the deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. For our part we are ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been: in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU. This is a very tight corner for Johnson to have painted himself into. He is demanding the complete removal of the backstop and for all arrangements for the Irish border to be negotiated during the transition period as part of the future relationship. Only on Wednesday, the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said: \u201cI got the impression that he wasn\u2019t just talking about deleting the backstop, he was talking about a whole new deal\u2026 That is not going to happen. Any suggestion that there can be a whole new deal negotiated in weeks or months is totally not in the real world.\u201d No deal We will begin right away on working to change the tax rules to provide extra incentives to invest in capital and research. We will prepare an economic package to boost British business and lengthen this country\u2019s lead as the number one destination in this continent for overseas investment. Gove has been tasked in government with ramping up no-deal preparations but Johnson suggests this will go well beyond finding more warehouse capacity or queueing systems at Dover. It has previously been reported a Johnson emergency budget could include an overhaul of stamp duty, abolishing the levy on homes worth less than \u00a3500,000, and raising the threshold for businesses\u2019 annual investment allowance. The allowance allows businesses to cut their tax bill by writing off the cost of investment, such as machinery. NHS Mr Speaker, I am committed to making sure that the NHS receives the funds that were promised \u2026 This will include urgent funding for 20 hospital upgrades and winter-readiness. I have asked officials to provide policy proposals for drastically reducing waiting times and for GP appointments. Both Johnson and his new senior adviser Dominic Cummings have been keen to ensure that the Vote Leave promise of \u00a3350m a week for the NHS is delivered and Cummings has been reported to be keen to focus on health in his role. It is an area where the Conservatives are likely to be hugely outflanked by Labour \u2013 but the pledge for 20 hospital upgrades sounds like a retail-friendly, election-ready promise that voters will find easy to grasp. Crime To address the rise of violent crime in our country I have announced that there will be 20,000 extra police keeping us safe over the next three years. We will give greater powers for the police to use stop and search to help tackle violent crime. I have also tasked officials to draw up proposals to ensure that in future those found guilty of the most serious sexual and violent offences are required to serve a custodial sentence. Another pledge which sounds distinctly like it could form part of an election campaign. Polling shows public concern about violent crime is rising and Johnson has been a campaigner for increased stop and search unlike his predecessor who examined the evidence as home secretary and introduced stricter rules to stop the blanket-targeting of minority communities. As home secretary, Sajid Javid then overturned two reforms made by May, allowing officers in seven regions to step up stop-and-search. Environment Our United Kingdom of 2050 will no longer make any contribution whatsoever to the destruction of our precious planet brought about by carbon emissions \u2013 because we will have led the world in delivering that net zero target. We will be the home of electric vehicles \u2013 cars, even planes, powered by British-made battery technology being developed right here, right now. The Conservatives \u2013 and in particular Michael Gove in Defra \u2013 have tried to make the environment a key policy platform, primarily because it is a major international issue but also because it is largely uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged by any opposition parties. It is also a major passion of his partner, Carrie Symonds, who championed animal welfare and anti-plastic campaigns in her role at CCHQ. However, it is notable that although it is the issue that Johnson mentions first in detail \u2013 he goes no further than the Theresa May government had already promised. GM foods A bioscience sector liberated from anti genetic modification rules\u2026 we will be the seedbed for the most exciting and most dynamic business investments on the planet. Genetically modified foods are not grown commercially in the UK but a limited number can be imported. There are no fresh GM fruit or vegetables approved for consumption by humans in the EU \u2013 but Johnson hints that could change after Brexit. It is a strange policy platform for Johnson to launch on his first few days in the job, polls show that 41% of UK adults feel negatively about GM foods, compared to 17% who feel positive \u2013 though few polls have been conducted in recent years to measure how attitudes might have changed. Education I have listened to the concerns of many colleagues and we will increase the minimum level of per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools and return education funding to previous levels by the end of this parliament. This is not only a matter of major public concern but school funding was hugely damaging for many Conservative MPs in the 2017 election and an under-reported reason for the Conservatives\u2019 heavy losses. In his election campaign, he pledged \u00a350m to raise per-pupil funding in all secondary schools to \u00a35,000, which was ridiculed as equivalent to a 0.1% rise in the schools budget. This was later increased to a pledge of \u00a34.6bn more by 2022. The IFS has estimated \u00a34.9bn is needed to reverse cuts and protect current budgets. Immigration I am clear that our immigration system must change. For years, politicians have promised the public an Australian-style points based system. And today I will actually deliver on those promises \u2013 I will ask the migration advisory committee to conduct a review of that system as the first step in a radical rewriting of our immigration system. It is unclear what these reforms would actually mean, apart from a change for incoming EU citizens. The UK already has a points-based system for non-EEA migrants, introduced by the Labour government in 2008, where eligibility is determined by a set of mandatory criteria to which a fixed number of symbolic points are attached. A Commons library paper on the system, published in 2018, said: \u201cCalls for the UK to adopt a system closer to the \u2018Australian model\u2019 have persisted, although it has not always been obvious what advocates specifically have in mind.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Ukrainian authorities have seized a Russian tanker moored in a river port near the Black Sea in apparent retaliation for Russia\u2019s seizure of three Ukrainian vessels and arrest of 24 sailors in November last year. Ukraine\u2019s SBU security service said in a Facebook post on Thursday it had seized the Russian tanker Nika Spirit in Izmail, a port on the Danube River near the country\u2019s border with Romania. The SBU said it had seized documents from the ship and questioned its crew. It also released a video showing its officers and those from the military prosecutor\u2019s office boarding the vessel. The Russian foreign ministry threatened a swift retaliation if arrests were made, but later a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Kyiv told news agencies that while the vessel remained impounded, the crew were on their way back to Russia. Earlier, the Russian agency Interfax, citing an unnamed source, said there were about 15 sailors onboard the ship, all believed to be Russian citizens. Ukrainian prosecutors said about 10 crew members had been questioned. The SBU said the vessel had previously been called Neyma and had taken part in blocking the three Ukrainian ships in the Kerch strait last year, with the owners apparently changing its name to Nika Spirit to avoid detection. Russia annexed Crimea in 2014 and has built a bridge over the Kerch strait, which separates the peninsula from Russia. Ukrainian ships have to pass through the strait to exit the Sea of Azov. The 24 sailors seized during the November incident in the strait have been held in Russian prisons since. Moscow accused the ships of illegally entering Russian territorial waters, which Kyiv has denied. The Hamburg-based International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has condemned Moscow over the incident and said it should release the sailors. The newly elected Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said bringing the sailors home was a priority, and the move to seize the Russian vessel came after the comedian-turned-president won an overwhelming victory in parliamentary elections over the weekend. Zelenskiy spoke to Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, by telephone for the first time last week and discussed a possible prisoner exchange, and there was a sense that there could be a deal soon involving the 24 sailors.

The best legacy of Yousef\u2019s tragic death would be if this message could be got across \u2013 and knives regarded as \u2018uncool\u2019 by the young in society going forward.\u201d Makki\u2019s family boycotted the sentencing in order to \u201cmake a stand\u201d against Boy A\u2019s acquittal. Amid chants of \u201cJustice for Yousef\u201d, a 200-strong crowd made up of family members, schoolmates and supporters gathered on the steps of Manchester crown court to express their disappointment that no one has been found responsible for Makki\u2019s killing. Makki\u2019s elder sister, Jade Akoum, 28, told the Guardian that the family would keep fighting for justice, whether it was through civil action or whatever other avenue possible. Boy A\u2019s barrister, Alistair Webster QC, said the teenager had expressed \u201cgenuine insight and regret\u201d about the consequences of his actions and that he \u201cdoes not seek to underplay the serious nature of his role in the death of his friend\u201d. Webster said Boy A had acknowledged that his sentence for carrying a knife and perverting the course of justice \u201cwill never be long enough\u201d for Makki\u2019s family or the wider public. The defence barristers said the two 17-year-olds saw carrying knives as \u201csomething of a joke\u201d and that they had not acknowledged the dangers \u201cdespite their intelligence\u201d. \u201cAlthough the consequences weren\u2019t intended, they do of course vividly illustrate the dangers of carrying knives,\u201d he said. The trial had heard that Boy B bought two knives they carried on the day of Makki\u2019s death from an app called Wish. Giving evidence during the trial, Boy A said he found the blades \u201ccool\u201d and \u201csleek\u201d and that he carried one for protection. Eleanor Laws, representing Boy B, told the court that her client had never carried a knife before that day and was of positive good character and had no criminal record. He was a \u201chard-working, pleasant, gentle, kind, caring\u201d boy who had been left with chronic post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression following his friend\u2019s death. Webster said Boy A was at risk of serious harm and that he had been identified online by \u201cself-righteous armchair warriors\u201d, adding that this risk had been \u201cexacerbated by the local member of parliament, who really should know better\u201d \u2013 a reference to the Labour MP Lucy Powell who suggested jurors may have reached a different conclusion had Boy A been \u201cblack, at state school and from, say, Moss Side\u201d. \u2022 This article was edited on 23 August 2019 to amend details relating to Boy B.",

      "bodyText": "Low-carbon energy was used to generate more than half of the electricity used in the UK for the first time last year, according to official data. A rapid rise in renewable energy, combined with low-carbon electricity from nuclear reactors, made up almost 53% of generation in 2018, the government\u2019s annual review of energy statistics revealed. Renewable energy sources set a new record by meeting a third of the UK\u2019s power generation last year after the UK\u2019s capacity to generate power from the sun, wind, water and waste grew by 10%. The UK\u2019s use of coal fell by a quarter to a record low of just 5%, according to the report. The government\u2019s annual \u201cenergy bible\u201d confirms a string of record green energy records broken in recent years, as the UK undertakes more renewable energy projects and shuts down old, polluting coal plants. National Grid said earlier this year that the UK had recorded its greenest ever winter due to windy weather and dwindling coal-fired power. This followed the second greenest summer, which fell narrowly short of the 2017 record for renewable energy due to a long heatwave. Very hot weather can have a negative impact on renewable energy generation because high pressure weather systems can suppress wind speeds, and solar panels produce less electricity if temperatures climb too high. The rise of renewables has edged out coal and gas plants which together made up less than 45% of the UK\u2019s electricity last year. Gas generation fell to 39.5% of the generation mix last year, from 40.4% in 2017. Coal generation continued to decline, falling to 5.1% last year after the Eggborough coal plant shut and Drax converted one of its units to burn biomass instead. Only five coal plants will be left running by the end of the coming winter after SSE announced plans to shut its last coal plant at Fiddler\u2019s Ferry near Warrington, Cheshire, in March 2020. Emma Pinchbeck, the deputy chief executive of Renewable UK, said the record-breaking figures \u201cclearly show that investment in renewables and the government\u2019s championing of offshore wind is delivering rapid change to our energy system\u201d. \u201cAs well as helping keep prices down for consumers and boosting the competitiveness of our businesses, renewables are a huge economic opportunity, bringing employment and investment to all parts of the UK,\u201d she said. The government threw its weight behind the offshore wind sector earlier this year by promising developers the chance to compete for a share of \u00a3557m of state subsidies in exchange for industry investment of \u00a3250m over the next 11 years. The deal could help offshore wind grow to 30% of the UK\u2019s electricity by 2030 as the UK works towards a 2050 target to cut emissions from the economy to net zero. But ministers have refused to lift a block on support for new onshore wind farms, which are unable to compete for subsidies despite being one of the cheapest forms of electricity. \u201cTo achieve its net zero ambitions, the new government needs to go further and faster - and the first steps should be removing the barriers to onshore wind which is our cheapest source of power, and building on our successes in innovative technologies like tidal energy and floating wind where the UK can be a world leader,\u201d Pinchbeck said.",

      "body": "<p>As the head of Papyrus, the UK charity for the prevention of young suicide, Ged Flynn regularly visits schools where the children and staff are struggling to cope with a pupil\u2019s death by suicide. A few years ago, he had a conversation with a teacher he will never forget.</p> <p>\u201cA group of young people had been talking about killing themselves. One of them did kill themselves, and the school brought me in to talk to the rest of them.

I don\u2019t know what to do.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Teenage suicide remains rare, thankfully. But since 2010, the number has increased by 67% in England and Wales: in 2017 alone, 187 children aged 10 to 19 in these countries took their own lives, 15% more than <a href=\"https://youngminds.org.uk/blog/worrying-rise-in-teen-suicides/\">in the previous year</a>. In Scotland, the number of suicides by young people aged 15 to 24 years old rose even more dramatically over the past 12 months, to a ten-year high of 96 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/scottish-suicide-rate-the-worst-for-five-years-as-deaths-among-young-at-ten-year-high-0jh36q5xv\">a 50% increase</a> over a single year.</p> <p>And the impact can be huge.

As a result, when a pupil takes their own life, it can send a school into a \u201cblind panic\u201d, Flynn says. \u201cThere\u2019s an avoidance of the subject of suicide. They want to say: \u2018Nothing\u2019s the matter here, and move on.\u2019\u201d In fact, all the evidence shows quite the opposite, says Flynn: \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk openly about suicide, there may well be another one.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Be sensitive. Don't change the subject. Be open and honest</p> <footer> <cite>Ged Flynn of Papyrus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rory O\u2019Connor, director of the Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory and professor of health psychology at the University of Glasgow, explains: \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no one single factor that leads to suicide, the work that we and others have done suggests one of the strongest risk factors is whether you\u2019ve known somebody else \u2013 either a close friend or a family member \u2013 who has died by suicide or has attempted suicide\u2026 It will affect people who are already vulnerable, who have already experienced distress themselves in their own lives.\u201d</p> <p>He believes every school should have a crisis response plan in place, which is not just about supporting the children who are in the immediate friendship group of the pupil who died. \u201cThe ripples of suicide are vast. What a school should be doing is acknowledging that the death has happened and then immediately offering support and reassurance for the whole school community.\u201d</p> <p>Any discussion about suicide should be followed with advice about where to go to seek help if pupils feel affected, and parents should be told to approach discussions at home in the same way. Schools can also put up posters advertising Papyrus\u2019 national \u201chopeline\u201d for young people who feel suicidal or have suicidal thoughts (0800 068 4141).</p> <p>The Samaritans offers a free support service to schools called Step by Step, which offers downloadable resources or a trained advisor for the first days and weeks. </p> <p>\u201cWe talk to the school and listen to what they feel they need at that time,\u201d says Carole Jordan, a senior volunteer who oversees the charity\u2019s education programmes. \u201cWe\u2019d also support them with how to break the news to pupils, parents and the local community.\u201d There are sample letters for parents, encouraging them to talk to their children about the suicide and recommending that they seek help and support if they are worried about their child\u2019s reaction. They are warned that young people can be affected for many months to come and they should tell their child to speak to an adult if their child becomes worried about a friend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/08/prevention-the-new-holy-grail-of-treating-mental-illness\">Prevention: the new holy grail of treating mental illness</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jordan says the programme doesn\u2019t give direct emotional support to pupils, \u201cbut we do offer support to the adults in the school to help them support the students\u201d. Advisers will listen, she says, and encourage those who need more support to get it.</p> <p>Papyrus picks up where the Samaritans leave off. As well as its helpline, the charity offers teachers and post-16-year-olds awareness-raising sessions on young suicide, and has created a downloadable guide for schools to use to prevent suicide in young people. This guide \u2013 Building Suicide-Safer Schools and Colleges \u2013 includes advice on how to spot the signs that a pupil may be considering taking their own life and how best to intervene to prevent a suicide. It also gives practical tips on how to support pupils and details of helpful and unhelpful language when talking about suicide. For example, the phrase \u201ccommit suicide\u201d suggests suicide is a crime, and describing a suicide as \u201csuccessful\u201d would be equally inappropriate.</p> <p>Similarly, teachers should avoid saying to a vulnerable young person: \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of doing something stupid/silly are you?\u201d This conveys that a pupil\u2019s suicidal thoughts are stupid or silly, and therefore may be met with a denial even though the child actually is considering ending their life. It arises, Flynn says, from the silence and taboo around suicide in general, which teachers must strive to overcome. \u201cIf we can say, \u2018Are you thinking about suicide then, Jimmy?\u2019 that child gets a stronger message that you\u2019re OK with the word.\u201d</p> <p>Flynn recommends teachers follow a few key principles: \u201cBe sensitive. Don\u2019t change the subject. Be open and honest.\u201d Asking \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d or \u201cIs there anything I can do to help you?\u201d and stressing that you will listen if any pupils want to talk is recommended. Trotting out cliches like \u201ctime heals everything\u201d or \u201cthey are at peace now\u201d is not.</p> <p>Schools should also encourage parents not to fear the subject of suicide. \u201cSchools need to get parents engaged with this. Bring them in, have a discussion \u2013 and if they are worried, offer them our helpline number,\u201d says Flynn.</p> <p>Both Flynn and O\u2019Connor warn that schools need to be careful when memorialising the pupil who died, and avoid glamorising the death or sharing any detail about the method of suicide.</p> <p>Other helpful programmes around the UK include <a href=\"https://www.thedecider.org.uk/\">The Decider</a>, a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme designed for schools that teachers can run themselves using a manual and video resources. Designed by psychotherapists Michelle Ayres and Carol Vivyan, it teaches children and teenagers 12 life skills to help them recognise and manage their thoughts, feelings and behaviours. \u201cSome parents say it has been life-changing,\u201d says Ayres. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.seasonsforgrowth.org.uk/\">Seasons for Growth</a> is a free eight-week programme in Scotland via the Notre Dame Centre (also available in Hillingdon, Leeds and North Wales that aims to help children cope with feelings of grief.</p> <p>All the experts agree that, like their pupils, it is important teachers look after their own mental health. In a 2017 survey, commissioned by Papyrus, one in 10 teachers said a student shares suicidal thoughts with them once a term or more, on average. Flynn, who is regularly approached by suicidal young people after he gives talks at schools, is one of the few people who truly understands how difficult this may be for a teacher. When a child tells him they are thinking about killing themselves, \u201cOf course it upsets me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes, if the young person starts to cry, he also breaks down and cries. \u201cI\u2019ll put my arm around them and say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what to say, but what I can offer you is a space to be heard.\u2019\u201d He listens, and he tells them he thinks they are uncertain about suicide, otherwise they would not be talking to him. He asks them if that is the case, and he tells them he wants to keep them safe. And then he will call the Papyrus helpline with them, and hope that he can get them the help they need.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and Papyrus can be contacted on 080</em><em>0 068 4141.

But the reality is that schools are not always prepared. As a result, when a pupil takes their own life, it can send a school into a \u201cblind panic\u201d, Flynn says. \u201cThere\u2019s an avoidance of the subject of suicide. They want to say: \u2018Nothing\u2019s the matter here, and move on.\u2019\u201d In fact, all the evidence shows quite the opposite, says Flynn: \u201cIf you don\u2019t talk openly about suicide, there may well be another one.\u201d Rory O\u2019Connor, director of the Suicidal Behaviour Research Laboratory and professor of health psychology at the University of Glasgow, explains: \u201cAlthough there\u2019s no one single factor that leads to suicide, the work that we and others have done suggests one of the strongest risk factors is whether you\u2019ve known somebody else \u2013 either a close friend or a family member \u2013 who has died by suicide or has attempted suicide\u2026 It will affect people who are already vulnerable, who have already experienced distress themselves in their own lives.\u201d He believes every school should have a crisis response plan in place, which is not just about supporting the children who are in the immediate friendship group of the pupil who died. \u201cThe ripples of suicide are vast. What a school should be doing is acknowledging that the death has happened and then immediately offering support and reassurance for the whole school community.\u201d Any discussion about suicide should be followed with advice about where to go to seek help if pupils feel affected, and parents should be told to approach discussions at home in the same way. Schools can also put up posters advertising Papyrus\u2019 national \u201chopeline\u201d for young people who feel suicidal or have suicidal thoughts (0800 068 4141). The Samaritans offers a free support service to schools called Step by Step, which offers downloadable resources or a trained advisor for the first days and weeks. \u201cWe talk to the school and listen to what they feel they need at that time,\u201d says Carole Jordan, a senior volunteer who oversees the charity\u2019s education programmes. \u201cWe\u2019d also support them with how to break the news to pupils, parents and the local community.\u201d There are sample letters for parents, encouraging them to talk to their children about the suicide and recommending that they seek help and support if they are worried about their child\u2019s reaction. They are warned that young people can be affected for many months to come and they should tell their child to speak to an adult if their child becomes worried about a friend. Jordan says the programme doesn\u2019t give direct emotional support to pupils, \u201cbut we do offer support to the adults in the school to help them support the students\u201d. Advisers will listen, she says, and encourage those who need more support to get it. Papyrus picks up where the Samaritans leave off. As well as its helpline, the charity offers teachers and post-16-year-olds awareness-raising sessions on young suicide, and has created a downloadable guide for schools to use to prevent suicide in young people. This guide \u2013 Building Suicide-Safer Schools and Colleges \u2013 includes advice on how to spot the signs that a pupil may be considering taking their own life and how best to intervene to prevent a suicide. It also gives practical tips on how to support pupils and details of helpful and unhelpful language when talking about suicide. For example, the phrase \u201ccommit suicide\u201d suggests suicide is a crime, and describing a suicide as \u201csuccessful\u201d would be equally inappropriate. Similarly, teachers should avoid saying to a vulnerable young person: \u201cYou\u2019re not thinking of doing something stupid/silly are you?\u201d This conveys that a pupil\u2019s suicidal thoughts are stupid or silly, and therefore may be met with a denial even though the child actually is considering ending their life. It arises, Flynn says, from the silence and taboo around suicide in general, which teachers must strive to overcome. \u201cIf we can say, \u2018Are you thinking about suicide then, Jimmy?\u2019 that child gets a stronger message that you\u2019re OK with the word.\u201d Flynn recommends teachers follow a few key principles: \u201cBe sensitive. Don\u2019t change the subject. Be open and honest.\u201d Asking \u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d or \u201cIs there anything I can do to help you?\u201d and stressing that you will listen if any pupils want to talk is recommended. Trotting out cliches like \u201ctime heals everything\u201d or \u201cthey are at peace now\u201d is not. Schools should also encourage parents not to fear the subject of suicide. \u201cSchools need to get parents engaged with this. Bring them in, have a discussion \u2013 and if they are worried, offer them our helpline number,\u201d says Flynn. Both Flynn and O\u2019Connor warn that schools need to be careful when memorialising the pupil who died, and avoid glamorising the death or sharing any detail about the method of suicide. Other helpful programmes around the UK include The Decider, a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) programme designed for schools that teachers can run themselves using a manual and video resources. Designed by psychotherapists Michelle Ayres and Carol Vivyan, it teaches children and teenagers 12 life skills to help them recognise and manage their thoughts, feelings and behaviours. \u201cSome parents say it has been life-changing,\u201d says Ayres. Seasons for Growth is a free eight-week programme in Scotland via the Notre Dame Centre (also available in Hillingdon, Leeds and North Wales that aims to help children cope with feelings of grief. All the experts agree that, like their pupils, it is important teachers look after their own mental health. In a 2017 survey, commissioned by Papyrus, one in 10 teachers said a student shares suicidal thoughts with them once a term or more, on average. Flynn, who is regularly approached by suicidal young people after he gives talks at schools, is one of the few people who truly understands how difficult this may be for a teacher. When a child tells him they are thinking about killing themselves, \u201cOf course it upsets me,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m human.\u201d Sometimes, if the young person starts to cry, he also breaks down and cries. \u201cI\u2019ll put my arm around them and say: \u2018I don\u2019t know what to say, but what I can offer you is a space to be heard.\u2019\u201d He listens, and he tells them he thinks they are uncertain about suicide, otherwise they would not be talking to him. He asks them if that is the case, and he tells them he wants to keep them safe. And then he will call the Papyrus helpline with them, and hope that he can get them the help they need. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 and Papyrus can be contacted on 0800 068 4141. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org",

Indeed, overwhelmingly and gratingly positive!

I walk with a stick, and increasingly notice a common lilt when speaking with official agencies. Recently, I contacted a charity for help with installing some curtain poles \u2013 doing so myself might lead to a fall, and fractured bones are too high a price for classy interior design. Its clientele is predominantly of the aged persuasion, and someone answered the call loudly saying: \u201cMRS ANDERSON!

I explained that I was disabled, and to our mutual relief they immediately understood, adopting a more fitting tone, reflective of me not being hard of hearing and befuddled. </p> <p>If you apply for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/08/majority-passengers-disabilities-report-problems-using-trains-uk\" title=\"\">disabled travel</a> pass, you\u2019ll notice the website features snowy-haired older folk. How must younger disabled people feel? Imagine being a wheelchair user in your teens faced with images more suited to your grandparents\u2019 than your own concerns? Examples of this unpleasant assumption are widespread. Signs on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/13/britain-transport-disabled-person\" title=\"\">transport</a> asking for seats to be relinquished for those \u201cwho need it more\u201d often depict stooping frail people. Older people might feel dismissed, too \u2013 given most of them are still in possession of their faculties.</p> <p>I once had to speak to an energy company when I was temporarily blind due to MS. This company was determined to send a man to read my meter, stressing that he\u2019d have photo ID, despite my reluctance. I explained to a surly unhelpful woman that ID is useless to me \u2013 being blind and everything. In an instant, her tone switched from disinterested hostility to gushing, sparkling (fake) warmth. Newly helpful, she said she didn\u2019t know she was speaking to a \u201clovely disabled lady!\u201d and summoned her supervisor to help. Tetchily I explained that I wasn\u2019t \u201clovely\u201d but was irritated and wanted to be treated as a sentient adult. This is far from unusual. But I can be lovely on a good day, when I\u2019m not being condescended to.</p> <p>When my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/05/new-homes-accessible-older-disabled-people\" title=\"\">living situation</a> was being investigated by a housing worker, I had one official who spoke to me s \u2026 l \u2026 o \u2026 w \u2026 l \u2026 y. When it became clear I did not require the suggested sheltered housing, the official then invited me to a drop-in help centre and shouted that I would be offered \u201ca cup of tea and a sausage roll\u201d. There\u2019s a twee condescension to it all. How do they treat people who really are older, but have full and active lives? And what of younger people who require the assistance of supported housing?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/23/lib-dems-stained-austerity-trust-tories\">The Lib Dems are deeply stained by austerity.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a tone of voice. All disabled people recognise it. People. Speak. Slowly. And. Say. My name. A lot. (In case I have forgotten it.) They are also upbeat! Indeed, overwhelmingly and gratingly positive! It\u2019s the same tone used for what are deemed to be confused older people, and I hate it \u2013 because I am disabled, not confused and not hard of hearing. My mobility is worsening, due to multiple sclerosis. I walk with a stick, and increasingly notice a common lilt when speaking with official agencies. Recently, I contacted a charity for help with installing some curtain poles \u2013 doing so myself might lead to a fall, and fractured bones are too high a price for classy interior design. Its clientele is predominantly of the aged persuasion, and someone answered the call loudly saying: \u201cMRS ANDERSON! HOW CAN WE HELP?\u201d By not patronising me? I explained that I was disabled, and to our mutual relief they immediately understood, adopting a more fitting tone, reflective of me not being hard of hearing and befuddled. If you apply for a disabled travel pass, you\u2019ll notice the website features snowy-haired older folk. How must younger disabled people feel? Imagine being a wheelchair user in your teens faced with images more suited to your grandparents\u2019 than your own concerns? Examples of this unpleasant assumption are widespread. Signs on transport asking for seats to be relinquished for those \u201cwho need it more\u201d often depict stooping frail people. Older people might feel dismissed, too \u2013 given most of them are still in possession of their faculties. I once had to speak to an energy company when I was temporarily blind due to MS. This company was determined to send a man to read my meter, stressing that he\u2019d have photo ID, despite my reluctance. I explained to a surly unhelpful woman that ID is useless to me \u2013 being blind and everything. In an instant, her tone switched from disinterested hostility to gushing, sparkling (fake) warmth. Newly helpful, she said she didn\u2019t know she was speaking to a \u201clovely disabled lady!\u201d and summoned her supervisor to help. Tetchily I explained that I wasn\u2019t \u201clovely\u201d but was irritated and wanted to be treated as a sentient adult. This is far from unusual. But I can be lovely on a good day, when I\u2019m not being condescended to. When my living situation was being investigated by a housing worker, I had one official who spoke to me s \u2026 l \u2026 o \u2026 w \u2026 l \u2026 y. When it became clear I did not require the suggested sheltered housing, the official then invited me to a drop-in help centre and shouted that I would be offered \u201ca cup of tea and a sausage roll\u201d. There\u2019s a twee condescension to it all. How do they treat people who really are older, but have full and active lives? And what of younger people who require the assistance of supported housing? Genuine help when requested is very much appreciated. But when imposed thoughtlessly, it\u2019s upsetting. I was waiting for a bus, lost in thoughts about an exhibition I had just attended, when an official wearing the dreaded hi-vis vest practically swatted the queue to one side with a clipboard, booming: \u201cThis poor lady needs to sit down!\u201d I prefer to avoid those punitive, haemorrhoid-inducing defensive spikes that pass for seating in bus shelters. And I can speak for myself. She was aghast that I declined the seat. On another occasion, I nearly lost it completely when a bus driver exclaimed that I was \u201ctoo young for a walking stick\u201d. What might help is training, clearly stressing that there is a difference between disability and the restrictions that may come with age. So please listen to disabled people, pay attention to their genuine needs and don\u2019t make assumptions \u2013 older people might be thankful, too. \u2022 Penny Anderson is a writer and artist",

Wild Card (2015)</h2> \n<p>Statham is usually so convincingly capable on screen that it can actually be quite fun to see him play a screw-up, as in this baggy Vegas story about a wayward security consultant trying to sort his life out between fistfights.</p> \n<h2>21. Cellular (2004)</h2> \n<p>Our man is a straight-up villain in this daft but energetic B-movie. Statham stuffs Kim Basinger in his trunk but she manages to place a random call to future Captain America Chris Evans, who sets off in improvised pursuit.</p> \n<h2>20. The Expendables 2 (2012)</h2> \n<p>The grenades-and-grunting franchise peaked at number two, not least because Statham gets a killer one-liner while disguised as a monk: \u201cI now pronounce you \u2026 man and knife.\u201d</p> \n<h2>19. The One (2001)</h2> \n<p>Jet Li energetically beats himself up while bemused multiverse cops Delroy Lindo and Statham look on in this entertaining sci-fi fantasy .</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bacda1cb0953ea5c533fac41f50b46d75acaa88e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bacda1cb0953ea5c533fac41f50b46d75acaa88e/0_0_5147_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Statham in Mechanic: Resurrection.

Mechanic: Resurrection (2016)</h2> \n<p>After declining to continue the Transporter franchise following a lowball offer from the producers, Statham elected to sequel-ise his Charles Bronson remake instead \u2013 to efficient and lucrative (if rather uninspiring) effect.</p> \n<h2>17. Furious 7 (2015)</h2> \n<p>Having turned up unexpectedly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIO_9mjHR8A\" title=\"\">at the end of Fast and Furious 6</a> to take revenge for his brother\u2019s hospitalisation, Statham\u2019s dapper mercenary Deckard Shaw nonchalantly sabotaged Vin Diesel\u2019s heroic crew throughout the next instalment. No wonder they eventually recruited him.</p> \n<h2>16. Crank: High Voltage (2009)</h2> \n<p>How do you top the gonzo excess of <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479884/\" title=\"\">Crank</a>, the film for which the fearless Statham should probably have won an Oscar? You pile on even more gore, violence and questionable language for a deranged sequel that is just a little too lurid for its own good.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"711957c85293844e39ea7decefdf767648b0dd60\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/711957c85293844e39ea7decefdf767648b0dd60/0_134_3201_2169/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Statham with Robert De Niro in Killer Elite.

Unfortunately everyone plays second fiddle to Clive Owen\u2019s distracting moustache.</p> \n<h2>14. Transporter 2 (2005)</h2> \n<p>After blowing up half of Europe in the original, Statham\u2019s supremely fastidious driver is enjoying a quiet life in Miami as a chauffeur for a rich family. But it\u2019s not long before a kidnap plot requires him to vault back into action in this bright, loud sequel.</p> \n<h2>13. Parker (2013)</h2> \n<p>Like Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson before him, Statham slips into the shoes of honourable career criminal Parker, the hardboiled creation of pulp author <a href=\"https://www.donaldwestlake.com/\" title=\"\">Donald Westlake</a>. This sunny heist tale about shady characters is worth it to see him charm Jennifer Lopez while posing as a Texas oil man, complete with stetson.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4963dd49bd5492c0213d1c3a04bb7f57eb7fdf01\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4963dd49bd5492c0213d1c3a04bb7f57eb7fdf01/0_0_729_470/500.jpg\" alt=\"Looking great in 1970s kit ...

The Bank Job (2008)</h2> \n<p>After The Italian Job, another heist: loosely inspired by the real-life ransacking of the Lloyds Baker Street branch in 1971. Car dealer Statham is put up to it by old flame Saffron Burrows, unaware that it is all part of a larger establishment plot. Instead of punches, Stath throws glowering looks, but looks great in 1970s wardrobe.</p> \n<h2>11. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)</h2> \n<p>Statham\u2019s silent, intimidating stare has become so familiar that it is easy to forget he made his debut as a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeztSCCX6VY\" title=\"\">motormouth wheeler-dealer</a>, hand-picked by writer/director Guy Ritchie because of his gift of the gab. The voice has deepened to a sandpaper rasp over the years, but even among an ensemble cast of memorable faces, Statham\u2019s screen charisma shines through.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b003e06b0e5fcde4af9907d34a506cb87aab5d7f\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b003e06b0e5fcde4af9907d34a506cb87aab5d7f/0_129_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A very particular set of rules ...

The Transporter (2002)</h2> \n<p>The original and best of the franchise. Statham\u2019s first tryout as a standalone action star cast him as Frank Martin, a besuited wheelman with an immaculate black BMW and a very particular set of rules. But it was when Frank peeled off his driving gloves to take care of a double-crossing client that Statham truly demonstrated he had the chops (and jabs, and leg sweeps, and headbutts). In a prolonged bus garage fight scene worthy of Jackie Chan, Frank <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ot2RkUSRjmg\" title=\"\">slathers his rippling bod in motor oil</a> to take on an army of henchmen, slipping through their grasp while cracking skulls.</p> \n<h2>9. Hummingbird (2013)</h2> \n<p>Statham has been nothing if not a grafter. After The Transporter came an industrious decade of pump-action thrillers that helped solidify his brand in pop culture: a raspy brawler with a hefty forward kick. Then he took a sharp left turn into drama. Writer/director Steven Knight\u2019s tale of a homeless army veteran who gets a second chance in London\u2019s underworld is a little overwrought \u2013 Stath falls for a nun \u2013 but it showed the hardnut had a surprisingly convincing softer side. (That delicate title would not fly in the US, though, where it was rebranded as Redemption.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsLk0NPRFAc\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bsLk0NPRFAc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>8. The Meg (2018)</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/16/the-meg-shark-action-film-message-ecological-destruction\">The Meg: it's got shark-punching, but it's also got a message about the environment. Yes, really</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite being an intimidatingly muscled hunk with a head like a lightbulb, Statham has always moved with uncommon physical grace. Perhaps it has something to do with his hinterland as a high diver <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWrINMm1aCI\" title=\"\">(he represented England at the Commonwealth Games in 1990)</a>. His palpable ease knifing through the water brings a wisp of plausibility to this undemanding summer blockbuster in which a jittery team of scientists battle a gigantic prehistoric shark. The overall result may be a little choppy, but Statham is never less than rock-solid as the single-minded submariner who bares his teeth almost as much as the Megalodon.</p> \n<h2>7. Blitz (2011)</h2> \n<p>In this impressively bleak London crime yarn, Statham\u2019s fearsome hooligan Brant is introduced decking a street gang with a hurling stick. He is also, apparently, the hero: a tetchy detective who \u2013 even when partnered with by-the-book Paddy Considine \u2013 has a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhO2WJ3MNRI\" title=\"\">uniquely volcanic investigative style</a>. It helps that their quarry is a scrawny sicko (Aidan Gillen) murdering random bobbies for kicks. Sledgehammer justice is required, and the cocksure Brant delivers in spades. \u201cAin\u2019t you gonna take any notes?\u201d asks one skittish informant. \u201cDo I look like I carry a pencil?\u201d growls Stath.</p> \n<h2>6. Fast and Furious 8 (2017)</h2> \n<p>Such was his charisma in Fast 7, Statham\u2019s freelance bad guy Deckard Shaw found himself repositioned as a goodie in the biggest modern action franchise, while his ongoing alpha-dog feud with the mighty Dwayne Johnson was deemed entertaining enough to warrant their own imminent spin-off, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SA7FaKxZVI\" title=\"\">Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw</a>. In this expensive but disjointed action-fest, Statham is also given the most exhilarating solo showcase: scooping up a kidnapped baby while engaging in brutal close-quarters combat with several angry mercenaries on a compromised cargo plane. It\u2019s John Wick: The Childminder Years as Stath makes comforting goo-goo noises between ruthless headshots.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0b13b81c0df4e63ddc521f7a3efd3b6f735b7bb5\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b13b81c0df4e63ddc521f7a3efd3b6f735b7bb5/0_50_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meticulous assassin ...

The Mechanic (2011)</h2> \n<p>Slotting Statham into a remake of <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-mechanic-1972\" title=\"\">an old Charles Bronson movie</a> makes a lot of sense: both built successful careers out of playing variations on the same capable archetype, attracting loyal fans who like to know what they are getting. As a meticulous freelance assassin who specialises in making his kills look like accidents, Statham gets a lot of methodical set-pieces in this underrated thriller, and seems ice-cool when paired with twitchy apprentice Ben Foster. This also feels like the point where Statham took full control of his screen image, cruising around sunny New Orleans in covetable chunky knitwear and luxurious turtlenecks, now his signature look.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"735cd84304661d7e3252b391a856893a91551fe8\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/735cd84304661d7e3252b391a856893a91551fe8/0_168_2720_1632/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lead role ...

Snatch (2000)</h2> \n<p>After giving him his breakout role in Lock, Stock, Guy Ritchie retained the services of Statham for his similarly convoluted follow-up, still operating in a heightened milieu of jewel-encrusted geezers and dim ne\u2019er-do-wells. Despite the attention-grabbing injection of US talent \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySyBMTo-1sc\" title=\"\">notably Brad Pitt</a> \u2013 he is essentially the lead, a small-time boxing promoter coerced into the murky world of match-fixing. Just a few years later, audiences might plausibly expect Stath to simply batter everyone in his path but it is just as fun seeing him forced to survive on his wits alone.</p> \n<h2>3. Crank (2006)</h2> \n<p>For this heroically absurd movie to succeed it required a fully committed and stunt-capable star, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVycWA5nDJQ\" title=\"\">Statham gives it his all</a>. Hitman Chev Chelios has been dosed with a toxin that will kill him within an hour unless he can generate adrenaline: cue an escalating series of high-octane encounters, from snorting drugs off grubby bathroom floors to having al fresco make-up sex in the middle of the street. Crank is hyper-violent and often puerile, but it maintains its insane momentum to the last, with stomach-flipping scenes of Statham dangling out of a helicopter door high above LA that might even make Hollywood\u2019s foremost daredevil Tom Cruise go: nah, too risky.</p> \n<h2>2. Safe (2012)</h2> \n<p>This textured NYC thriller has the pulpiest of set-ups: a young Chinese girl is lost and alone on the streets, pursued by the Triads and crooked cops. The poor girl wouldn\u2019t stand a chance, except she bumps into a suicidal homeless man with an enigmatic past who suddenly realises he has something to live for. Statham as a vengeful hobo taking on the entire New York underworld would be a tantalising premise by itself but adding such a sweet central relationship \u2013 and some impressively headlong action sequences \u2013 makes this his most well-rounded and soulful headlining movie.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfInGEdTz18\"> \n <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MfInGEdTz18?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>1. Spy (2015)</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/01/jason-statham-i-want-to-be-the-next-james-bond\">Jason Statham: 'Do I want to be the next James Bond? Absolutely'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Statham had dabbled in comedy \u2013 the Crank franchise is essentially energy-drink slapstick, and he has a cameo in Steve Martin\u2019s 2006 Pink Panther remake \u2013 but Paul Feig\u2019s slick espionage spoof was the first movie to let him really go for it. The results are astonishing. As CIA operative Rick Ford, Stath is a boggle-eyed, blowhard Bond, so incensed that timid analyst Melissa McCarthy has been deployed in the field that he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfInGEdTz18\" title=\"\">scatters F-bombs everywhere </a>while blustering his way through his secret agent achievements: \u201cI\u2019ve swallowed enough microchips and shit them back out again to make a computer!\u201d. He rants. He raves. He gurns. And he remains convinced that the agency has a fully-functioning Face/Off machine. Starring in all those heist films finally paid off: Statham steals the movie.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"166615a1-ed30-43e9-9201-083a41ce7713\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Actors</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/07/actors-playing-nightmarish-versions-of-themselves-in-cinema-ranked-keeanu-reeves\">Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema -

      "bodyText": "39. In The Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (2007) From German shlockmeister Uwe Boll, this tepid fantasy yarn tasks Jason Statham\u2019s sturdy yeoman with slapping down evil sorcerer Ray Liotta. The undisputed low point. 38. Turn It Up (2000) In his little-seen US debut, Statham convincingly plays raspy heavy Mr B in a tale of Brooklyn rapping and drug-dealing gone awry, endangering Ja Rule\u2019s face with a deli-slicing machine. 37. 13 (2010) This bumpy remake of a bare-bones French thriller thrusts desperate men into a life-or-death Russian Roulette tournament; Statham has little to do as a rich businessman betting on the result. 36. Chaos (2005) Wily bank robber Wesley Snipes taunts a familiar-looking rough-and-ready cop while greenhorn Ryan Phillippe delivers a TED talk on chaos theory in this listless would-be thriller. 35. Mean Machine (2001) This clunky Vinnie Jones time capsule \u2013 a soccer-focused redo of The Longest Yard \u2013 features a young Statham as mercurial goalie Monk, daydreaming of making cartwheeling saves against a team of lousy screws. 34. Collateral (2004) Only the briefest of cameos but crucially Statham does not look out of place in Michael Mann\u2019s glittering nocturnal thriller, bumping into steely visiting hitman Tom Cruise to pass on vital intel. \u201cEnjoy LA,\u201d he purrs at the Cruiser. 33. London (2005) London is a girl, not the city in this talky, coked-up drama: confident entrepreneur Statham (almost unrecognisable with short but thick and slickly parted hair) tries to help lovesick Chris Evans get his mojo back at a swanky party. 32. Revolver (2005) For his third (and so far final) collaboration with Guy Ritchie, Statham sports a great handlebar moustache but seems unmoored in a quasi-philosophical card-shark tale where luck is a formula. 31. War (2007) Regular dance partners Statham and Jet Li butt heads in a confusing tale of gang rivalry and revenge that features an aggravating late-game twist. 30. The Expendables 3 (2014) Sylvester Stallone\u2019s ad hoc pension fund for waning action stars was running out of puff by its third instalment and the ever-expanding cast list unforgivably sidelined his steadfast lieutenant Statham. 29. Gnomeo and Juliet (2011) Stath does Shakespeare, sort of, as a particularly aggro Tybalt in this knockabout CG version of the classic tragedy retooled for kids in smart-ass Shrek fashion. 28. Death Race (2008) All the satirical edges of the cult 1975 movie Death Race 2000, about a lethal motor rally across the US, were filed off for this uninspired remake, set entirely on a drab prison island. As a coerced driver, Statham looks convincingly glum. 27. Homefront (2013) Written by Stallone and once apparently mooted as a low-key Rambo sequel, this Louisiana-set drama sees retired DEA man Statham and his cute daughter terrorised by not-very-scary meth dealer Gator (James Franco). 26. The Expendables (2010) Stallone\u2019s wheeze of rounding up the sort of names that used to headline the VHS Action aisle in Blockbuster turned out to be a lucrative if not entirely entertaining franchise. Recruiting Statham as beret-sporting knife man Lee Christmas (!) did at least seem like a passing of the torch between generations. 25. Transporter 3 (2008) After a sunny dalliance in Miami, it\u2019s back to Europe for the deluxe Deliveroo man, tasked with carting feisty cargo Natalya Rudakova to a ruthless crime boss. Sparks fly, but the whole thing soon runs out of gas. 24. The Italian Job (2003) Mark Wahlberg is certainly no Michael Caine so luckily Statham is on hand, as getaway driver Handsome Rob, to bring some actual English class to this polished but soulless pseudo-reboot of the beloved classic. 23. Ghosts of Mars (2001) Statham versus marauding space zombies sounds irresistible, but he is a distinct second-stringer as rugged space cop Jericho Butler in John Carpenter\u2019s muddled sci-fi western, related confusingly in flashback. 22. Wild Card (2015) Statham is usually so convincingly capable on screen that it can actually be quite fun to see him play a screw-up, as in this baggy Vegas story about a wayward security consultant trying to sort his life out between fistfights. 21. Cellular (2004) Our man is a straight-up villain in this daft but energetic B-movie. Statham stuffs Kim Basinger in his trunk but she manages to place a random call to future Captain America Chris Evans, who sets off in improvised pursuit. 20. The Expendables 2 (2012) The grenades-and-grunting franchise peaked at number two, not least because Statham gets a killer one-liner while disguised as a monk: \u201cI now pronounce you \u2026 man and knife.\u201d 19. The One (2001) Jet Li energetically beats himself up while bemused multiverse cops Delroy Lindo and Statham look on in this entertaining sci-fi fantasy . 18. Mechanic: Resurrection (2016) After declining to continue the Transporter franchise following a lowball offer from the producers, Statham elected to sequel-ise his Charles Bronson remake instead \u2013 to efficient and lucrative (if rather uninspiring) effect. 17. Furious 7 (2015) Having turned up unexpectedly at the end of Fast and Furious 6 to take revenge for his brother\u2019s hospitalisation, Statham\u2019s dapper mercenary Deckard Shaw nonchalantly sabotaged Vin Diesel\u2019s heroic crew throughout the next instalment. No wonder they eventually recruited him. 16. Crank: High Voltage (2009) How do you top the gonzo excess of Crank, the film for which the fearless Statham should probably have won an Oscar? You pile on even more gore, violence and questionable language for a deranged sequel that is just a little too lurid for its own good. 15. Killer Elite (2011) If it was a thrill for Statham to star opposite Robert De Niro in this SAS assassination thriller \u2013 based on a novel by Sir Ranulph Fiennes \u2013 he does not let it show, grimacing throughout the confusing, globetrotting plot. Unfortunately everyone plays second fiddle to Clive Owen\u2019s distracting moustache. 14. Transporter 2 (2005) After blowing up half of Europe in the original, Statham\u2019s supremely fastidious driver is enjoying a quiet life in Miami as a chauffeur for a rich family. But it\u2019s not long before a kidnap plot requires him to vault back into action in this bright, loud sequel. 13. Parker (2013) Like Lee Marvin and Mel Gibson before him, Statham slips into the shoes of honourable career criminal Parker, the hardboiled creation of pulp author Donald Westlake. This sunny heist tale about shady characters is worth it to see him charm Jennifer Lopez while posing as a Texas oil man, complete with stetson. 12. The Bank Job (2008) After The Italian Job, another heist: loosely inspired by the real-life ransacking of the Lloyds Baker Street branch in 1971. Car dealer Statham is put up to it by old flame Saffron Burrows, unaware that it is all part of a larger establishment plot. Instead of punches, Stath throws glowering looks, but looks great in 1970s wardrobe. 11. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) Statham\u2019s silent, intimidating stare has become so familiar that it is easy to forget he made his debut as a motormouth wheeler-dealer, hand-picked by writer/director Guy Ritchie because of his gift of the gab. The voice has deepened to a sandpaper rasp over the years, but even among an ensemble cast of memorable faces, Statham\u2019s screen charisma shines through. 10. The Transporter (2002) The original and best of the franchise. Statham\u2019s first tryout as a standalone action star cast him as Frank Martin, a besuited wheelman with an immaculate black BMW and a very particular set of rules. But it was when Frank peeled off his driving gloves to take care of a double-crossing client that Statham truly demonstrated he had the chops (and jabs, and leg sweeps, and headbutts). In a prolonged bus garage fight scene worthy of Jackie Chan, Frank slathers his rippling bod in motor oil to take on an army of henchmen, slipping through their grasp while cracking skulls. 9. Hummingbird (2013) Statham has been nothing if not a grafter. After The Transporter came an industrious decade of pump-action thrillers that helped solidify his brand in pop culture: a raspy brawler with a hefty forward kick. Then he took a sharp left turn into drama. Writer/director Steven Knight\u2019s tale of a homeless army veteran who gets a second chance in London\u2019s underworld is a little overwrought \u2013 Stath falls for a nun \u2013 but it showed the hardnut had a surprisingly convincing softer side. (That delicate title would not fly in the US, though, where it was rebranded as Redemption.) 8. The Meg (2018) Despite being an intimidatingly muscled hunk with a head like a lightbulb, Statham has always moved with uncommon physical grace. Perhaps it has something to do with his hinterland as a high diver (he represented England at the Commonwealth Games in 1990). His palpable ease knifing through the water brings a wisp of plausibility to this undemanding summer blockbuster in which a jittery team of scientists battle a gigantic prehistoric shark. The overall result may be a little choppy, but Statham is never less than rock-solid as the single-minded submariner who bares his teeth almost as much as the Megalodon. 7. Blitz (2011) In this impressively bleak London crime yarn, Statham\u2019s fearsome hooligan Brant is introduced decking a street gang with a hurling stick. He is also, apparently, the hero: a tetchy detective who \u2013 even when partnered with by-the-book Paddy Considine \u2013 has a uniquely volcanic investigative style. It helps that their quarry is a scrawny sicko (Aidan Gillen) murdering random bobbies for kicks. Sledgehammer justice is required, and the cocksure Brant delivers in spades. \u201cAin\u2019t you gonna take any notes?\u201d asks one skittish informant. \u201cDo I look like I carry a pencil?\u201d growls Stath. 6. Fast and Furious 8 (2017) Such was his charisma in Fast 7, Statham\u2019s freelance bad guy Deckard Shaw found himself repositioned as a goodie in the biggest modern action franchise, while his ongoing alpha-dog feud with the mighty Dwayne Johnson was deemed entertaining enough to warrant their own imminent spin-off, Fast &amp; Furious Presents: Hobbs &amp; Shaw. In this expensive but disjointed action-fest, Statham is also given the most exhilarating solo showcase: scooping up a kidnapped baby while engaging in brutal close-quarters combat with several angry mercenaries on a compromised cargo plane. It\u2019s John Wick: The Childminder Years as Stath makes comforting goo-goo noises between ruthless headshots. 5. The Mechanic (2011) Slotting Statham into a remake of an old Charles Bronson movie makes a lot of sense: both built successful careers out of playing variations on the same capable archetype, attracting loyal fans who like to know what they are getting. As a meticulous freelance assassin who specialises in making his kills look like accidents, Statham gets a lot of methodical set-pieces in this underrated thriller, and seems ice-cool when paired with twitchy apprentice Ben Foster. This also feels like the point where Statham took full control of his screen image, cruising around sunny New Orleans in covetable chunky knitwear and luxurious turtlenecks, now his signature look. 4. Snatch (2000) After giving him his breakout role in Lock, Stock, Guy Ritchie retained the services of Statham for his similarly convoluted follow-up, still operating in a heightened milieu of jewel-encrusted geezers and dim ne\u2019er-do-wells. Despite the attention-grabbing injection of US talent \u2013 notably Brad Pitt \u2013 he is essentially the lead, a small-time boxing promoter coerced into the murky world of match-fixing. Just a few years later, audiences might plausibly expect Stath to simply batter everyone in his path but it is just as fun seeing him forced to survive on his wits alone. 3. Crank (2006) For this heroically absurd movie to succeed it required a fully committed and stunt-capable star, and Statham gives it his all. Hitman Chev Chelios has been dosed with a toxin that will kill him within an hour unless he can generate adrenaline: cue an escalating series of high-octane encounters, from snorting drugs off grubby bathroom floors to having al fresco make-up sex in the middle of the street. Crank is hyper-violent and often puerile, but it maintains its insane momentum to the last, with stomach-flipping scenes of Statham dangling out of a helicopter door high above LA that might even make Hollywood\u2019s foremost daredevil Tom Cruise go: nah, too risky. 2. Safe (2012) This textured NYC thriller has the pulpiest of set-ups: a young Chinese girl is lost and alone on the streets, pursued by the Triads and crooked cops. The poor girl wouldn\u2019t stand a chance, except she bumps into a suicidal homeless man with an enigmatic past who suddenly realises he has something to live for. Statham as a vengeful hobo taking on the entire New York underworld would be a tantalising premise by itself but adding such a sweet central relationship \u2013 and some impressively headlong action sequences \u2013 makes this his most well-rounded and soulful headlining movie. 1. Spy (2015) Statham had dabbled in comedy \u2013 the Crank franchise is essentially energy-drink slapstick, and he has a cameo in Steve Martin\u2019s 2006 Pink Panther remake \u2013 but Paul Feig\u2019s slick espionage spoof was the first movie to let him really go for it. The results are astonishing. As CIA operative Rick Ford, Stath is a boggle-eyed, blowhard Bond, so incensed that timid analyst Melissa McCarthy has been deployed in the field that he scatters F-bombs everywhere while blustering his way through his secret agent achievements: \u201cI\u2019ve swallowed enough microchips and shit them back out again to make a computer!\u201d. He rants. He raves. He gurns. And he remains convinced that the agency has a fully-functioning Face/Off machine. Starring in all those heist films finally paid off: Statham steals the movie.",

About 500 giant cruise ships dock in the city on the south coast of the popular holiday destination of Mallorca each year, disgorging 2 million passengers. The manifesto calling for curbs on the ships, which has already been signed by more than 30 organisations and 11,000 islanders, will be presented at a conference in Palma on Friday. It calls for a limit of one cruise ship with a maximum of 4,000 passengers disembarking on any given day. At present, there are often five and even as many as eight moored in the port, with some 15,000 passengers on board. The manifesto \u2013 drawn up by a group of more than 30 NGOs, residents\u2019 associations and community groups \u2013 asserts that \u201cmega cruise ship tourism has increased in a way that is unsustainable and undesirable for our city, leading to serious environmental impact and increasing social protest\u201d.

      "body": "<p>It was the crumpet that did it. Sure, the mackerel pat\u00e9 was mesmerising, the pickled oyster piquant and the brill terrine as dazzling as its name suggests. But, as we half-rolled out of Cornerstone seafood restaurant in east London, the crumpet was what sank into our memory \u2013 dripping with butter and laden with small, sweetly savoury potted shrimps.</p> <p>It was our childhood \u2013 or, at least, the crumpet was: its buttery lattice and doughy insides up there with Live and Kicking as a highlight of Saturday mornings. It was comfort food: fat, carbohydrate and nostalgia together with a palpable sense of home.</p> <p>\u201cIt is what all food should be,\u201d says Cornerstone\u2019s owner, Tom Brown. \u201cFood you crave, that you want to dive straight into. I don\u2019t want you to read our menu and think: \u2018What is that?\u2019 I want you to think: \u2018I want that!\u2019\u201d While the era of esoteric menus shows no signs of ending (see <a href=\"https://www.eatnative.co.uk/tasting-menu\" title=\"\">Native\u2019s pea pod ice cream with wood ants</a>, say, or <a href=\"https://www.lenclume.co.uk/restaurant/sample-lunch-dinner\" title=\"\">l\u2019Enclume\u2019s aged veal in coal oil</a>) Brown is increasingly not alone in rejecting these modish, \u201cchallenging\u201d dishes in favour of food that resonates and restores.</p> <p>\u201cI have definitely noticed a surge in comfort food dishes appearing on restaurant menus,\u201d says the chef George Barson of Cora Pearl in Covent Garden. His menu is a luxury tour of Britain\u2019s comfort food highlights: faggots and peas, bubble and squeak risotto and a ham and cheese toastie Barson describes as \u201ccompletely recognisable and not trying to be anything other than what it is\u201d. This is comfort food not as chefs of the 00s had it \u2013 disdained, or so deconstructed as to be unrecognisable \u2013 but perfected and polished, with quality ingredients. \u201cWe aren\u2019t bringing back the original rubbish, highly processed versions of 80s and 90s comfort food,\u201d observes the food historian Angela Clutton. \u201cThe generation of chefs opening restaurants now are those thinking: \u2018We loved those foods when we were younger \u2013 let\u2019s make good ones, with our newfound respect for quality and provenance.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"702158b5fa540aa9546387f849b2288fcd099964\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/702158b5fa540aa9546387f849b2288fcd099964/0_307_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is a palpable physiological link between sinking your face into a steaming bowl of mashed potato and feeling sated and content.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is a palpable physiological link between sinking your face into a steaming bowl of mashed potato and feeling sated and content.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Buppha Wuttifery/Getty Images/EyeEm</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Historically, the concept of \u201ccomfort food\u201d has little precedence. The have-nots ate what they could afford, while those who had ate as lavishly as they could so as to distinguish themselves. Food was classist rather than emotive, says Clutton. \u201cYou and I know if we have a chocolate hobnob, we will feel better afterwards, but I don\u2019t know if, in the past, people would have articulated that feeling. From a historical perspective, the closest comparison comes from the mid-Victorian era, when middle-class families were moving to cities and cookery writers such as Mrs Beeton introduced an element of rural nostalgia to their books to help housewives feel connected to their pastoral upbringings.\u201d This was one of the earliest examples of cookbooks offering emotional as well as practical support.</p> <p>It is a pattern echoed by Nigella Lawson in her book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/feast.html\" title=\"\">Feast</a>, in which she used recipes to navigate life\u2019s highs and lows, by Diana Henry in <a href=\"http://dianahenry.co.uk/books/roast-figs-sugar-snow/\" title=\"\">Roast Figs Sugar Snow</a> and by Laura Goodman in <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/carbs.html\" title=\"\">Carbs</a>, her love letter to carbohydrates. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to hide it, shoving carbs aside for cauliflower rice and courgetti, but we\u2019re not fooling anyone. Carbs are what we want \u2013 what we really, really want,\u201d Goodman writes by way of introduction to recipes such as spaghetti and meatballs, challah bread and hash browns.</p> <p>Of course, your comfort food might not feature carbohydrates. As Clutton points out, \u201ccomfort food is not just about social food history, but your personal food history \u2013 the food of your childhood\u201d. Nevertheless, there is a palpable physiological link between sinking your face into a steaming bowl of mashed potato or sticky coconut rice and feeling sated and content. \u201cThere was a book years ago called <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/potatoes-not-prozac.html\" title=\"\">Potatoes not Prozac</a> that advised people with depression to eat more carbohydrates \u2013 because they are a real mood-enhancer,\u201d says the psychologist and writer Amanda Hills. \u201cThey make you sleep better and they encourage an upsurge in serotonin.\u201d She believes there is a connection between the rise in comfort food and our collective anxiety. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a larger trend toward regressing slightly away from what people see as an uncertain world toward something that makes them feel safe.\u201d</p> <p>Hills notes with interest that the generation most likely to eat out now \u2013 late 20s, early 30s, no kids \u2013 are the same generation who are most likely to tell her they are worried about politics and the climate crisis. \u201cThey report to me their concerns about Brexit and Trump\u2019s America. In these times a comforting meal can take them briefly back to childhood, in much the same way as the remakes of the Disney films they grew up with. These are constants in a world of rapid, frightening changes\u201d \u2013 even if, like Aladdin and Brown\u2019s crumpet, they have been updated slightly for today\u2019s more sophisticated palates.</p> <p>Proust was spot on when he described the childhood memories induced by the madeleine: \u201cTaste and smell are tied up with memory: they occupy the same area of the brain, the hippocampus,\u201d Hills says. As <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chefcalum/\" title=\"\">Calum Franklin</a>, the executive chef at Holborn Dining Rooms in London, says of his celebrated, golden-crusted pies: \u201cIt is a good way to bring back childhood memories of the family table and, in a way, give diners a break from the pressures and uncertainties that surround us.\u201d</p> <p>To the extent that he was calling for the end of molecular gastronomy or \u201cthe Scandi foraged stuff\u201d, Brown was exaggerating for effect. \u201cThere are chefs who do this amazingly well \u2013 who are leaders in their field,\u201d he says. The \u201cdiscomfort food\u201d (as he calls it) comes when less-skilled chefs make a hash of haute cuisine \u2013 neither nourishing nor innovative, warming or \u201cwow\u201d. In previous years, chefs looking to earn a Michelin star have automatically reached for such novelties. \u201cYet, if you look across the world, all the best cuisines are steeped in heritage, in people cooking the same way for generations,\u201d Brown says. Take a snapshot of popular food trends, and it is ramen bars, pasta restaurants, dumplings, biangbiang noodles and pies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7fef9c600090a2a0d79d464158f2682e6adcfa1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7fef9c600090a2a0d79d464158f2682e6adcfa1/0_355_7210_4328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You and I know if we have a chocolate hobnob, we will feel better afterwards.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You and I know if we have a chocolate hobnob, we will feel better afterwards.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cComfort food is something that has to be fresh and eaten when still hot,\u201d proclaims Kasia Hitchcock, the co-owner of the tiny, critically acclaimed <a href=\"https://www.thesparrows.me/\" title=\"\">Sparrows</a> in Manchester. The sp\u00e4tzle and dumplings of her partner Franco Concli\u2019s Tyrolean heritage are \u201csimple, honest and tasty food that serves its purpose of regenerating mind and soul as well as providing rest from urban living\u201d: a purpose that would doubtless have made Mrs Beeton proud. There is a universality to comfort food, in that regardless of class, creed or country, there is a cheese-smothered, oil-oozing, salty-sweet carbfest for every culture.</p> <h2><strong>Chefs\u2019 favourite comfort foods</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tom Oldroyd of Oldroyd/Duke of Richmond, London </strong>\u201cAt home, I\u2019ll probably make an Indian lentil and egg curry, or roast a whole chicken with all the trimmings.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Romy Gill of Rom\u2019s Kitchen, Bristol </strong>\u201cCheese on toast \u2013 and it has to be white bread. It takes me back to my childhood. I didn\u2019t have it while growing up in India, yet somehow there\u2019s a connection.

      "bodyText": "It was the crumpet that did it. Sure, the mackerel pat\u00e9 was mesmerising, the pickled oyster piquant and the brill terrine as dazzling as its name suggests. But, as we half-rolled out of Cornerstone seafood restaurant in east London, the crumpet was what sank into our memory \u2013 dripping with butter and laden with small, sweetly savoury potted shrimps. It was our childhood \u2013 or, at least, the crumpet was: its buttery lattice and doughy insides up there with Live and Kicking as a highlight of Saturday mornings. It was comfort food: fat, carbohydrate and nostalgia together with a palpable sense of home. \u201cIt is what all food should be,\u201d says Cornerstone\u2019s owner, Tom Brown. \u201cFood you crave, that you want to dive straight into. I don\u2019t want you to read our menu and think: \u2018What is that?\u2019 I want you to think: \u2018I want that!\u2019\u201d While the era of esoteric menus shows no signs of ending (see Native\u2019s pea pod ice cream with wood ants, say, or l\u2019Enclume\u2019s aged veal in coal oil) Brown is increasingly not alone in rejecting these modish, \u201cchallenging\u201d dishes in favour of food that resonates and restores. \u201cI have definitely noticed a surge in comfort food dishes appearing on restaurant menus,\u201d says the chef George Barson of Cora Pearl in Covent Garden. His menu is a luxury tour of Britain\u2019s comfort food highlights: faggots and peas, bubble and squeak risotto and a ham and cheese toastie Barson describes as \u201ccompletely recognisable and not trying to be anything other than what it is\u201d. This is comfort food not as chefs of the 00s had it \u2013 disdained, or so deconstructed as to be unrecognisable \u2013 but perfected and polished, with quality ingredients. \u201cWe aren\u2019t bringing back the original rubbish, highly processed versions of 80s and 90s comfort food,\u201d observes the food historian Angela Clutton. \u201cThe generation of chefs opening restaurants now are those thinking: \u2018We loved those foods when we were younger \u2013 let\u2019s make good ones, with our newfound respect for quality and provenance.\u2019\u201d Historically, the concept of \u201ccomfort food\u201d has little precedence. The have-nots ate what they could afford, while those who had ate as lavishly as they could so as to distinguish themselves. Food was classist rather than emotive, says Clutton. \u201cYou and I know if we have a chocolate hobnob, we will feel better afterwards, but I don\u2019t know if, in the past, people would have articulated that feeling. From a historical perspective, the closest comparison comes from the mid-Victorian era, when middle-class families were moving to cities and cookery writers such as Mrs Beeton introduced an element of rural nostalgia to their books to help housewives feel connected to their pastoral upbringings.\u201d This was one of the earliest examples of cookbooks offering emotional as well as practical support. It is a pattern echoed by Nigella Lawson in her book Feast, in which she used recipes to navigate life\u2019s highs and lows, by Diana Henry in Roast Figs Sugar Snow and by Laura Goodman in Carbs, her love letter to carbohydrates. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to hide it, shoving carbs aside for cauliflower rice and courgetti, but we\u2019re not fooling anyone. Carbs are what we want \u2013 what we really, really want,\u201d Goodman writes by way of introduction to recipes such as spaghetti and meatballs, challah bread and hash browns. Of course, your comfort food might not feature carbohydrates. As Clutton points out, \u201ccomfort food is not just about social food history, but your personal food history \u2013 the food of your childhood\u201d. Nevertheless, there is a palpable physiological link between sinking your face into a steaming bowl of mashed potato or sticky coconut rice and feeling sated and content. \u201cThere was a book years ago called Potatoes not Prozac that advised people with depression to eat more carbohydrates \u2013 because they are a real mood-enhancer,\u201d says the psychologist and writer Amanda Hills. \u201cThey make you sleep better and they encourage an upsurge in serotonin.\u201d She believes there is a connection between the rise in comfort food and our collective anxiety. \u201cIt\u2019s part of a larger trend toward regressing slightly away from what people see as an uncertain world toward something that makes them feel safe.\u201d Hills notes with interest that the generation most likely to eat out now \u2013 late 20s, early 30s, no kids \u2013 are the same generation who are most likely to tell her they are worried about politics and the climate crisis. \u201cThey report to me their concerns about Brexit and Trump\u2019s America. In these times a comforting meal can take them briefly back to childhood, in much the same way as the remakes of the Disney films they grew up with. These are constants in a world of rapid, frightening changes\u201d \u2013 even if, like Aladdin and Brown\u2019s crumpet, they have been updated slightly for today\u2019s more sophisticated palates. Proust was spot on when he described the childhood memories induced by the madeleine: \u201cTaste and smell are tied up with memory: they occupy the same area of the brain, the hippocampus,\u201d Hills says. As Calum Franklin, the executive chef at Holborn Dining Rooms in London, says of his celebrated, golden-crusted pies: \u201cIt is a good way to bring back childhood memories of the family table and, in a way, give diners a break from the pressures and uncertainties that surround us.\u201d To the extent that he was calling for the end of molecular gastronomy or \u201cthe Scandi foraged stuff\u201d, Brown was exaggerating for effect. \u201cThere are chefs who do this amazingly well \u2013 who are leaders in their field,\u201d he says. The \u201cdiscomfort food\u201d (as he calls it) comes when less-skilled chefs make a hash of haute cuisine \u2013 neither nourishing nor innovative, warming or \u201cwow\u201d. In previous years, chefs looking to earn a Michelin star have automatically reached for such novelties. \u201cYet, if you look across the world, all the best cuisines are steeped in heritage, in people cooking the same way for generations,\u201d Brown says. Take a snapshot of popular food trends, and it is ramen bars, pasta restaurants, dumplings, biangbiang noodles and pies. \u201cComfort food is something that has to be fresh and eaten when still hot,\u201d proclaims Kasia Hitchcock, the co-owner of the tiny, critically acclaimed Sparrows in Manchester. The sp\u00e4tzle and dumplings of her partner Franco Concli\u2019s Tyrolean heritage are \u201csimple, honest and tasty food that serves its purpose of regenerating mind and soul as well as providing rest from urban living\u201d: a purpose that would doubtless have made Mrs Beeton proud. There is a universality to comfort food, in that regardless of class, creed or country, there is a cheese-smothered, oil-oozing, salty-sweet carbfest for every culture. Chefs\u2019 favourite comfort foods Tom Oldroyd of Oldroyd/Duke of Richmond, London \u201cAt home, I\u2019ll probably make an Indian lentil and egg curry, or roast a whole chicken with all the trimmings.\u201d Romy Gill of Rom\u2019s Kitchen, Bristol \u201cCheese on toast \u2013 and it has to be white bread. It takes me back to my childhood. I didn\u2019t have it while growing up in India, yet somehow there\u2019s a connection. It gives me joy and comfort and fills me up.\u201d Jacob Kennedy of Plaquemine Lock, London \u201cFor me, it\u2019s food with soul. Whether it\u2019s a French cassoulet, Italian tagliatelle al ragu, an English pie, Cajun gumbo or Creole jambalaya, it\u2019s food that tells a story of home and hearth and welcome.\u201d Franco Concli of Sparrows, Manchester \u201cI am from Trentino in Italy and whenever we travel there are always gnocchi to welcome us home.\u201d George Barson of Cora Peal/Kitty Fisher\u2019s, London \u201cMy ultimate comfort food is toast \u2013 thickly cut and served with slightly cold salty butter spread unevenly, so that every now and then you bite through a cold layer of butter into the hot toast beneath.

On 24 January 1976, they took to the field with \u201cKettering Tyres\u201d emblazoned across their shirts for a game against Bath City in the Southern League. Their chief executive Derek Dougan had done a four-figure deal, much to the annoyance of the FA who told him to remove them. The FA had banned shirt sponsorship in 1972. Dougan tried to pull a fast one by changing the logo to \u201cKettering T\u201d \u2013 claiming the T was for Town rather than Tyres, but he had no such luck. Nevertheless the FA wilted from pressure from other clubs and lifted the ban in 1977. Forty years later and Liverpool\u2019s deal with Standard Chartered is worth around \u00a340m for this season alone \u2013 although given that \u00a340m can only get you four-fifths of Sean Longstaff, perhaps sponsorship hasn\u2019t grown as wildly as you might imagine.</p> <p>This month the big sponsorship story has been Huddersfield Town. The club joined with the bookmakers Paddy Power to release a kit with a hen-do-sized sash across their strip. It was hideous. As a publicity stunt it worked a dream \u2013 social media meltdown, the FA contacting the club, before the big reveal of a sponsorless shirt. That happened a day or two earlier than planned because the club were getting worried about the adverse publicity.</p> <p>There is clearly a serious issue with the amount of gambling in football. As Rob Davies reported last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/19/half-of-premier-league-clubs-to-have-gambling-sponsors-for-201920\" title=\"\">half of Premier League shirts will have a betting company\u2019s logo this season</a> \u2013 with 17 of the 24 Championship clubs following suit. To give Paddy Power some credit, if that\u2019s allowed, along with Ladbrokes\u2019 owner GVC, they have called for an end to shirt sponsorship deals \u2013 the former also won\u2019t advertise on perimeter hoardings at grounds. Clearly they know what they\u2019re doing \u2013 throwing the gauntlet down to less well known gambling firms to follow suit \u2013 and they can get their publicity in other ways. But if it means kids see less of it, along with no whistle-to-whistle gambling ads on TV that comes into place this year, that is a positive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The industry bankrolls not only football clubs, but all parts of the game. I\u2019ve done radio phone-ins on gambling addiction, thanking callers for devastating personal accounts of their addictions before throwing to an ad break filled with odds, offers, accas and free bets. The single biggest problem the addicts told me was that some firms would not leave them alone, even after cancelling all their accounts. It\u2019s a competitive market, but surely there\u2019s enough to go round while letting the most vulnerable deal with their problems with the space they need. I don\u2019t write from a lofty perch here. I like gambling, even if I only lose about a hundred quid a year betting on long shots in the golf majors. I\u2019ve worked for gambling companies in the past.</p> <p>Since Huddersfield\u2019s \u201cunsponsoring\u201d announcement, Newport County and Motherwell have followed suit. And while the kits look good, there\u2019s a nostalgia to sponsors that I\u2019m not sure I want to lose. It\u2019s how I remember kits. As a kid, I didn\u2019t know the difference between a sponsor and a kit manufacturer. As far as I knew from all my extensive Panini \u201987 swap deals, AVCO made West Ham kits and WANG Oxford. Everton were NEC and Arsenal were JVC. Perry Groves recounted this week how the players got half-price TVs from the deal. He would buy a load and sell them to his mates \u2013 cost price, not for profit!</p> <p>I remember seeing an advert with Jeff Goldblum drinking Holsten Pils and my brain completely failing to work out the connection between that and Tottenham Hotspur. I didn\u2019t know who Jeff Goldblum was. I didn\u2019t really know what beer was. And I couldn\u2019t for the life of me link that to the glorious Hummel/Holsten late-80s Glenn Hoddle kit. I am a sucker for those chevrons.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jul/23/david-squires-on-new-football-kits-betting-and-banter\">David Squires on \u2026 new football kits, betting and banter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I remember the unbridled joy of getting the full Spurs kit and proudly wearing it for about four weeks solid. It was the Gascoigne, Lineker, Holsten shirt \u2013 chevrons down the shorts too. I spent the late-80s and early-90s entirely dressed in Spurs and Cambridge. I don\u2019t have a clue who designed the Cambridge ones but the sponsors are etched on my mind, from Lynfox to Howlett \u2026 then, as we went up the leagues, Fujitsu \u2013 a foreign company! Since then we\u2019ve returned to steel works and skip manufacturers \u2013 proper League Two sponsors. All the way through I couldn\u2019t tell you who actually designed them \u2013 until now. We have chevrons.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest kits of them all are unsponsored. Barcelona \u2013 until they went nice with Unicef and then gear changed to Qatar \u2013 Denmark \u201986, Brazil 1970. Things of real beauty. If I had one hope for this season, it\u2019s that teams wear their home shirt whenever they can. The unnecessary use of third kits might be good for marketing, but really the game is \u201cwell and truly gone\u201d if Liverpool choose to run around looking like 11 Stabilo orange marker pens when they could be in red.</p> <p>Was there a better kit spectacle than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jul/06/copa-america-final-brazil-peru-live\" title=\"\">the Copa Am\u00e9rica final</a> this summer? Two sides, in their classic kits \u2013 the yellow and blue of Brazil versus the sash of Peru. That is a sash everyone can get behind.</p>",

Dougan tried to pull a fast one by changing the logo to \u201cKettering T\u201d \u2013 claiming the T was for Town rather than Tyres, but he had no such luck. Nevertheless the FA wilted from pressure from other clubs and lifted the ban in 1977. Forty years later and Liverpool\u2019s deal with Standard Chartered is worth around \u00a340m for this season alone \u2013 although given that \u00a340m can only get you four-fifths of Sean Longstaff, perhaps sponsorship hasn\u2019t grown as wildly as you might imagine. This month the big sponsorship story has been Huddersfield Town. The club joined with the bookmakers Paddy Power to release a kit with a hen-do-sized sash across their strip. It was hideous. As a publicity stunt it worked a dream \u2013 social media meltdown, the FA contacting the club, before the big reveal of a sponsorless shirt. That happened a day or two earlier than planned because the club were getting worried about the adverse publicity. There is clearly a serious issue with the amount of gambling in football. As Rob Davies reported last week, half of Premier League shirts will have a betting company\u2019s logo this season \u2013 with 17 of the 24 Championship clubs following suit. To give Paddy Power some credit, if that\u2019s allowed, along with Ladbrokes\u2019 owner GVC, they have called for an end to shirt sponsorship deals \u2013 the former also won\u2019t advertise on perimeter hoardings at grounds. Clearly they know what they\u2019re doing \u2013 throwing the gauntlet down to less well known gambling firms to follow suit \u2013 and they can get their publicity in other ways. But if it means kids see less of it, along with no whistle-to-whistle gambling ads on TV that comes into place this year, that is a positive. The industry bankrolls not only football clubs, but all parts of the game. I\u2019ve done radio phone-ins on gambling addiction, thanking callers for devastating personal accounts of their addictions before throwing to an ad break filled with odds, offers, accas and free bets. The single biggest problem the addicts told me was that some firms would not leave them alone, even after cancelling all their accounts. It\u2019s a competitive market, but surely there\u2019s enough to go round while letting the most vulnerable deal with their problems with the space they need. I don\u2019t write from a lofty perch here. I like gambling, even if I only lose about a hundred quid a year betting on long shots in the golf majors. I\u2019ve worked for gambling companies in the past. Since Huddersfield\u2019s \u201cunsponsoring\u201d announcement, Newport County and Motherwell have followed suit. And while the kits look good, there\u2019s a nostalgia to sponsors that I\u2019m not sure I want to lose. It\u2019s how I remember kits. As a kid, I didn\u2019t know the difference between a sponsor and a kit manufacturer. As far as I knew from all my extensive Panini \u201987 swap deals, AVCO made West Ham kits and WANG Oxford. Everton were NEC and Arsenal were JVC. Perry Groves recounted this week how the players got half-price TVs from the deal. He would buy a load and sell them to his mates \u2013 cost price, not for profit! I remember seeing an advert with Jeff Goldblum drinking Holsten Pils and my brain completely failing to work out the connection between that and Tottenham Hotspur. I didn\u2019t know who Jeff Goldblum was. I didn\u2019t really know what beer was. And I couldn\u2019t for the life of me link that to the glorious Hummel/Holsten late-80s Glenn Hoddle kit. I am a sucker for those chevrons. I remember the unbridled joy of getting the full Spurs kit and proudly wearing it for about four weeks solid. It was the Gascoigne, Lineker, Holsten shirt \u2013 chevrons down the shorts too. I spent the late-80s and early-90s entirely dressed in Spurs and Cambridge. I don\u2019t have a clue who designed the Cambridge ones but the sponsors are etched on my mind, from Lynfox to Howlett \u2026 then, as we went up the leagues, Fujitsu \u2013 a foreign company! Since then we\u2019ve returned to steel works and skip manufacturers \u2013 proper League Two sponsors. All the way through I couldn\u2019t tell you who actually designed them \u2013 until now. We have chevrons. Perhaps the greatest kits of them all are unsponsored. Barcelona \u2013 until they went nice with Unicef and then gear changed to Qatar \u2013 Denmark \u201986, Brazil 1970. Things of real beauty. If I had one hope for this season, it\u2019s that teams wear their home shirt whenever they can. The unnecessary use of third kits might be good for marketing, but really the game is \u201cwell and truly gone\u201d if Liverpool choose to run around looking like 11 Stabilo orange marker pens when they could be in red. Was there a better kit spectacle than the Copa Am\u00e9rica final this summer? Two sides, in their classic kits \u2013 the yellow and blue of Brazil versus the sash of Peru. That is a sash everyone can get behind.",

The benefit was that on joining and becoming a \u201ccrew member\u201d you were given \u2013 free of charge \u2013 a uniform. The disbenefit was that, on each shift, you had to wear it. The trousers were capacious, the top deep blue and white with a stripy pattern. This, according to <a href=\"https://www.hrmagazine.co.uk/article-details/the-evolution-of-the-staff-uniform\" title=\"\">HR magazine</a> , was Ronald McD\u2019s attempt to utilise \u201cprimary colours and pin stripes, in line with the tailored feel of the power-suit.\u201d But even with the boat-shaped hat that made you look like one of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds, there really wasn\u2019t much power in that outfit. And it wasn\u2019t much of a suit. No wonder people dressed at work or arrived in outsized overcoats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the burgers required for hamburgers, cheeseburgers and Big Macs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I learned several things quickly. One was that in work as in life, there is a role for everyone: the key is how to find it. I did shifts deep-frying Filet-O-Fishes and frozen fries in enormous wire baskets. And I learned the hurried synchronicity required to make sure there was always sufficient fodder, and the adaptability to accommodate customers who jolted a system rooted in homogeneity by ordering bespoke.</p> <p>I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the <a href=\"https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/menu.html\" title=\"\">burgers</a> required for hamburgers, cheeseburgers and Big Macs. A few of those was enough. The man frying the regular burgers, and it was usually a burly, manly man, was like the stoker shovelling coal into the furnace of a steam engine fast enough to reach Manchester by sundown. It all seemed very Victorian: and to be honest, I was never very good at it. The proof was a shift spent cooking Quarter Pounders, which were thicker and needed searing on either side to cook them in the middle. One day I forgot and watched as eight unseared Quarter Pounders \u2013 each minus a hefty bite \u2013 were returned by queasy, irate customers. Presumably they stopped by en route to A&amp;E.</p> <p>From such days and such occurrences, I learned that it\u2019s best to match one\u2019s specific talents to every shared endeavour. It helped that I was raised in a family where chores were non-negotiable, especially for me, the youngest member. Clean the windows, hoover up, wash down the paintwork and skirting boards, wipe down the kitchen cupboards. These were the sort of things that had to be done before the weekend was my own. And so applying the fact that I had always worked to buy the things I wanted \u2013 starting with a paper round at 12 which morphed into a job with a chain of newsagents \u2013 and that I had no inherent fear of a mop or broom, I gravitated towards the shifts spent keeping tables and the restaurant clean and clearing the nearby streets of McDonald\u2019s litter.</p> <p>Trash collection was a local authority stipulation and a top priority. Clean restaurants, meanwhile, reflected the company mantra: incanted, and reinforced in the exams we took to obtain shiny star-studded crew hierarchy badges: \u201cquality, service, cleanliness\u201d.</p> <p>It was within this structure that I quickly realised that so long as the visible objectives were achieved: no one much cared where I was or what I did or how I did it.

      "bodyText": "There was, I discovered on obtaining a holiday job at McDonald\u2019s before embarking on A-levels, an immediate benefit and a simultaneous disbenefit. The benefit was that on joining and becoming a \u201ccrew member\u201d you were given \u2013 free of charge \u2013 a uniform. The disbenefit was that, on each shift, you had to wear it. The trousers were capacious, the top deep blue and white with a stripy pattern. This, according to HR magazine , was Ronald McD\u2019s attempt to utilise \u201cprimary colours and pin stripes, in line with the tailored feel of the power-suit.\u201d But even with the boat-shaped hat that made you look like one of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds, there really wasn\u2019t much power in that outfit. And it wasn\u2019t much of a suit. No wonder people dressed at work or arrived in outsized overcoats. I learned several things quickly. One was that in work as in life, there is a role for everyone: the key is how to find it. I did shifts deep-frying Filet-O-Fishes and frozen fries in enormous wire baskets. And I learned the hurried synchronicity required to make sure there was always sufficient fodder, and the adaptability to accommodate customers who jolted a system rooted in homogeneity by ordering bespoke. I did hot and gruelling shifts cooking the burgers required for hamburgers, cheeseburgers and Big Macs. A few of those was enough. The man frying the regular burgers, and it was usually a burly, manly man, was like the stoker shovelling coal into the furnace of a steam engine fast enough to reach Manchester by sundown. It all seemed very Victorian: and to be honest, I was never very good at it. The proof was a shift spent cooking Quarter Pounders, which were thicker and needed searing on either side to cook them in the middle. One day I forgot and watched as eight unseared Quarter Pounders \u2013 each minus a hefty bite \u2013 were returned by queasy, irate customers. Presumably they stopped by en route to A&amp;E. From such days and such occurrences, I learned that it\u2019s best to match one\u2019s specific talents to every shared endeavour. It helped that I was raised in a family where chores were non-negotiable, especially for me, the youngest member. Clean the windows, hoover up, wash down the paintwork and skirting boards, wipe down the kitchen cupboards. These were the sort of things that had to be done before the weekend was my own. And so applying the fact that I had always worked to buy the things I wanted \u2013 starting with a paper round at 12 which morphed into a job with a chain of newsagents \u2013 and that I had no inherent fear of a mop or broom, I gravitated towards the shifts spent keeping tables and the restaurant clean and clearing the nearby streets of McDonald\u2019s litter. Trash collection was a local authority stipulation and a top priority. Clean restaurants, meanwhile, reflected the company mantra: incanted, and reinforced in the exams we took to obtain shiny star-studded crew hierarchy badges: \u201cquality, service, cleanliness\u201d. It was within this structure that I quickly realised that so long as the visible objectives were achieved: no one much cared where I was or what I did or how I did it. This served me well. I wrote the Guardian Diary for seven years and the modus operandi was much the same. Others at McD\u2019s found a measure of autonomy but, as ever, some pushed the envelope further than it was meant to go. One crew member, bin liner in hand, famously departed on trash collection and was missing long enough for her absence to become an issue. She was found, bag in hand, emerging from the cinema. As underlings in an operation of strict rules and hierarchy, we enjoyed such acts of insubordination. Senior bosses seemed benign, but middle managers, the NCOs, could be disagreeable types with more power than they knew how to handle or deserved.

How does hot weather affect UK trains? The temperature of steel rails can climb 20 degrees higher than the air around them. So when temperatures are approaching 40 degrees, track temperatures can come close to 60 degrees. That causes the metal to expand, putting it at risk of buckling.

A third problem is that dry weather causes cracks, or even potholes, in the ground beneath the track. Trains travelling over such sections have to move more slowly for safety reasons.

      "body": "<p>Ada and her father avoid graveyards, for fear their presence will drag the dead right out of the ground. \u201cAll their heads will come up over the soil, all asking to be the first saved.\u201d This seethingly assured Irish debut infuses magic realism with critical and feminist theory, but the generous dose of horror movie imagery brings a left-field project firmly into the literary mainstream. Like all the best horror, it\u2019s an impressive balancing act between judicious withholding and unnerving reveals: you don\u2019t want to go into it knowing too much.</p> <p>We are told from the start, however, that father and daughter aren\u2019t human, though they live among us and work as healers; they can reach into bodies and pull disease out of the patients they call, in one of the book\u2019s many examples of slippage and projection, \u201cCures\u201d. Some of Ada\u2019s feats are trivial: charming a sore out of a mouth, so that it pops up on the kitchen wall. Some, like drawing miscarrying babies back over the border between life and death, are beyond her own comprehension. The novel\u2019s mixture of the monstrous and the everyday \u2013 Father\u2019s \u201clarge hand disappearing inside\u201d a woman \u201cwith a papery sound\u201d, then a pair of lungs taken out to rest in the pantry \u2013 is startling and uncanny, but never less than convincing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Follow Me to Ground features many staples of the horror genre: the fear of being buried alive, and psychic possession</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The story unfolds against a blazing summer, \u201cshadows cast so dark and deep they seem as solid and alive as the bodies that throw them\u201d. We are in an old-timey community, perhaps in Ireland or America\u2019s deep south, where people work in the fields, wear smocks and give each other scoldings, and have names like Arson Belle and Concord Jackson. Folklore bleeds into everyday reality: locals are terrified of the nearby Sister Eel Lake, where a tribe of carnivorous serpents consumed each other down to the last pair of siblings, the brother finally \u201cthrashing in the tight dark that was his sister\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Ada and her father avoid graveyards, for fear their presence will drag the dead right out of the ground. \u201cAll their heads will come up over the soil, all asking to be the first saved.\u201d This seethingly assured Irish debut infuses magic realism with critical and feminist theory, but the generous dose of horror movie imagery brings a left-field project firmly into the literary mainstream. Like all the best horror, it\u2019s an impressive balancing act between judicious withholding and unnerving reveals: you don\u2019t want to go into it knowing too much. We are told from the start, however, that father and daughter aren\u2019t human, though they live among us and work as healers; they can reach into bodies and pull disease out of the patients they call, in one of the book\u2019s many examples of slippage and projection, \u201cCures\u201d. Some of Ada\u2019s feats are trivial: charming a sore out of a mouth, so that it pops up on the kitchen wall. Some, like drawing miscarrying babies back over the border between life and death, are beyond her own comprehension. The novel\u2019s mixture of the monstrous and the everyday \u2013 Father\u2019s \u201clarge hand disappearing inside\u201d a woman \u201cwith a papery sound\u201d, then a pair of lungs taken out to rest in the pantry \u2013 is startling and uncanny, but never less than convincing. The story unfolds against a blazing summer, \u201cshadows cast so dark and deep they seem as solid and alive as the bodies that throw them\u201d. We are in an old-timey community, perhaps in Ireland or America\u2019s deep south, where people work in the fields, wear smocks and give each other scoldings, and have names like Arson Belle and Concord Jackson. Folklore bleeds into everyday reality: locals are terrified of the nearby Sister Eel Lake, where a tribe of carnivorous serpents consumed each other down to the last pair of siblings, the brother finally \u201cthrashing in the tight dark that was his sister\u201d. Though the Cures are grateful for Ada and her father\u2019s ministrations, not surprisingly they\u2019re scared of them too \u2013 \u201cand while they knew that we didn\u2019t eat and that we aged slow, they didn\u2019t know I stole the song out of baby birds or that Father ran through the woods like a bear\u201d.

There\u2019s a sickness in Samson, he says, and sickness \u2013 as he and Ada know well, and Freud might agree \u2013 seldom disappears. \u201cIt just goes elsewhere.\u201d Several novels recently have pushed beyond realism and enlisted fairytale and folklore to explore the violence done to female minds and bodies: Daisy Johnson\u2019s mythic swirl in Everything Under, Sophie Mackintosh\u2019s otherworldly dystopia The Water Cure, Emma Glass\u2019s language-collapsing Peach.

It sold 10m copies, spawned a superfluous remix album (\u2605\u2605) \u2013 also reissued here \u2013 and shattered one of Michael\u2019s records: its singles spent more consecutive weeks on the US chart than those from Thriller. 1989\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814 (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605) understandably declined to fix what wasn\u2019t broke, with a lumpy bit of faux-metal called Black Cat the solitary departure. It\u2019s effectively Control with the grandiose ambitions that tend to emerge when an artist has sold 10m albums: pretentious title, accompanying short movie, 20 tracks, eight of them spoken-word interludes. In hindsight, its much-vaunted social consciousness feels a little overemphasised \u2013 it only applies to the opening three tracks \u2013 but it is fantastic nonetheless: tough, funky and driving \u2013 the second of a perfect pair. Four years later, janet. (\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605) arrived amid priceless publicity: Jackson posing topless for Rolling Stone, newspapers breathlessly reporting that her new record deal was the most lucrative in history. But, as with Rhythm Nation\u2019s politicking, the album\u2019s USP \u2013 Janet Jackson singing about sex \u2013 feels overcooked. It\u2019s tame, even by 1993\u2019s standards \u2013 the previous year, Madonna had herself photographed hang-gliding naked \u2013 and some of it is actively excruciating: Throb\u2019s awkward patchwork of moans the first sign that the more explicit Jackson\u2019s work got, the less sexy it would be. Some of janet. has dated in a way that its two predecessors haven\u2019t \u2013 the post-grunge styling of Stax cover What\u2019ll I Do speaks volumes about its era \u2013 and it\u2019s a confused album, half glossy drivetime ballads, half a thrilling, pop-facing take on the dense racket the Bomb Squad conjured for Public Enemy, one that daringly buries Jackson\u2019s vocals in breakbeats, squealing guitar and samples of opera, jazz and the Supremes. At their best, the songs are magisterial: That\u2019s the Way Love Goes, Funky Big Band, Again. When she subsequently duetted with her now scandal-racked brother on 1995\u2019s Scream, it felt like she was doing him a favour. But Jackson had her own troubles, which seeped into 1997\u2019s sprawling The Velvet Rope (\u2605\u2605\u2605): disquietingly, it amped up the sex alongside songs about domestic violence, depression and her eating disorder. While the former was as unconvincing as ever, the latter were pretty compelling, not least What About\u2019s relentless excoriation of a violent ex. The music tended to trip-hoppy slow jams, but Got Til It\u2019s Gone\u2019s Joni Mitchell sample was irresistible, while on the song Empty, producers Jam and Lewis made one final experimental hurrah, playing a frantic drum\u2019n\u2019bass rhythm on a Roland 808. Muddled as it was, The Velvet Rope was Jackson\u2019s last great album. Released at the height of R&amp;B\u2019s early-noughties sonic envelope-pushing phase, 2001\u2019s All for You (\u2605\u2605) had its moments, the Carly Simon-sampling Son of a Gun among them, but it felt forced and lightweight when newcomers Aaliyah, Brandy and Kelis sounded as strange and futuristic as Jackson once had. It was the beginning of an ongoing creative spiral. Still, no one gets to hold on to the zeitgeist forever, and before her grip slackened she had more than proved her point: more than one Jackson mattered. This week Alexis listened to Lykke Li: Two Nights Fresh from collaborating with Mark Ronson, Lykke Li\u2019s new EP fits perfectly into his \u201csad bangers\u201d concept: Two Nights is part mournful piano ballad, part high-octane dancefloor pop.",

Ex-special counsel insists his report did not exonerate Trump During almost seven hours of testimony before two House committees on Wednesday, the former special counsel Robert Mueller said his Trump-Russia report had \u201cnot exculpated\u201d the president over alleged obstruction, and warned that Russia was still meddling in US elections. Yet the hearings failed to produce fresh revelations or a significant made-for-TV moment, allowing Republicans to describe it as a \u201cdisaster for Democrats\u201d, even as some Democrats claimed it as further grounds for impeachment. Saudi arms. Trump has vetoed congressional resolutions aimed at blocking his administration from selling $8.1bn in arms to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Presidential seal. The president spoke to a rightwing student summit in Washington on Tuesday in front of a projected presidential seal, which appeared to have been doctored to include references to Russia and golf. Puerto Rico governor resigns at last after text scandal After weeks of protests in Puerto Rico, the island\u2019s governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 has agreed to step down amid a scandal over his leaked text messages. Demonstrators outside his mansion in San Juan erupted into cheers as they learned Rossell\u00f3 would resign on 2 August, to be replaced by his justice secretary, Wanda V\u00e1zquez. \u201cThe demands have been overwhelming and I\u2019ve received them with highest degree of humility,\u201d Rossell\u00f3 said. Leaked texts. The protests began two weeks ago, after the leak of messages between Rossell\u00f3 and his inner circle, which included homophobic and sexist remarks, as well as jokes about the victims of Hurricane Maria. Europe swelters in record heat as climate consensus nears 100% The UK is braced for unprecedented temperatures of up to 39C (102F0 on Thursday, at least half a degree hotter than the country\u2019s previous record. Sweltering through Europe\u2019s second heatwave this summer, Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have also recorded their highest ever temperatures. The extreme weather is being blamed on the climate crisis, with a study suggesting the scientific consensus on humanity\u2019s role in global heating has surpassed 99%. YouTube videos. The majority of YouTube videos about the climate crisis run contrary to the scientific consensus, according to research. Boris Johnson packs cabinet with Brexiters and rightwingers The new British prime minister, Boris Johnson, has signalled a ruthless determination to deliver Brexit by culling more than half of Theresa May\u2019s cabinet and replacing them with a startlingly rightwing selection of Brexiters and free marketers. For instance, his new home secretary, Priti Patel, has advocated the return of the death penalty and was sacked from her previous cabinet post after holding secret meetings with Israeli lawmakers and lobbyists. Divisive figure. Johnson\u2019s first day in office was marked by protests in central London, in a preview of what is likely to be a deeply divisive premiership, despite his talk of unity. Scottish independence. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, has proposed a second referendum on Scottish independence in her first letter to the new PM. Crib sheet The financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was reportedly found unconscious in his Manhattan jail cell on Wednesday and taken to hospital with neck injuries. North Korea has fired two short-range missiles into the sea amid warnings from Pyongyang over planned war games between the US and South Korea in the region next month. Residents of Reserve in Louisiana \u2013 the subject of the Guardian\u2019s year-long \u201cCancer Town\u201d series \u2013 are diagnosed with cancer at \u201chighly unusual\u201d rates, according to an academic study. The Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill has had his conviction in a drug and gun case overturned by an appeals court after spending 11 years on probation, during which time he has become a prominent advocate for criminal justice reform.

Kari Paul finds out how former fans are removing or modifying their tattoos.

The move is clearly designed to protect the meat industry rather than consumers, says Arwa Mahdawi.

      "body": "<p>There was a moment during Boris Johnson\u2019s first <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-first-speech-pm-panel\">speech outside No 10</a> when it looked as if a snap general election was on the cards when he said that while there were now 99 days to Brexit, \u201cwe aren\u2019t going to wait 99 days, because the British people have had enough of waiting \u2013 the time has come to act\u201d.</p> \n<p>Johnson then veered back to talking about police numbers, but the brief panic among MPs and political journalists showed that many people do expect an election sooner rather than later.</p> \n<h2>Why is an early election possible?</h2> \n<p>It\u2019s all about the numbers. With the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s continued support \u2013 and this is still to be formalised \u2013 Johnson has a working majority of three. This is likely to be eroded further next week, with the Liberal Democrats tipped to take the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/05/pro-emain-parties-strike-brecon-and-radnorshire-byelection-pact-to-fight-conservatives\">Brecon and Radnoshire seat</a> from the Tories in a byelection. With the Lib Dems confident of attracting a Conservative defector or two (though nothing is certain) it is perfectly feasible that Johnson could return from the summer recess with no majority at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d492f6cf-1fda-46ad-a040-347be0393605\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>A cabinet reshuffle</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The first task of any new PM involves rewarding some loyal allies and disappointing more. Several Johnson loyalists have had their eye on the post of chancellor, but only one can do it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\">A complete clearout of May\u2019s remain-minded ministers</a> provided plenty of opportunity to reward the Brexit believers though.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The issue that will define a Johnson premiership. He has promised to rapidly renegotiate almost all of May\u2019s departure deal, ditching the Irish backstop border guarantee policy \u2013 something that would seem a huge task over any timescale, let alone little more than 12 weeks, a fair proportion of which is taken up by a summer break. If this fails, he will be set on a no-deal departure for 31 October, and a likely huge clash with MPs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Iran</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>If&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">Brexit</a>&nbsp;wasn\u2019t enough, a new Johnson government must immediately take steps to make sure he doesn\u2019t begin his time in No 10 with a slide into war. The situation in the gulf is complex, fast-moving and hugely dangerous. Johnson did not cover himself in glory as foreign secretary, especially over Iran. It will be his task to prove he has learned.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Managing parliament and Tory MPs</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Johnson will start as PM with a working Commons majority of four, thanks to the DUP, but within weeks it is likely to be down to three if as expected the Liberal Democrats win in the Brecon and Radnorshire byelection. If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge.

      "bodyText": "There was a moment during Boris Johnson\u2019s first speech outside No 10 when it looked as if a snap general election was on the cards when he said that while there were now 99 days to Brexit, \u201cwe aren\u2019t going to wait 99 days, because the British people have had enough of waiting \u2013 the time has come to act\u201d. Johnson then veered back to talking about police numbers, but the brief panic among MPs and political journalists showed that many people do expect an election sooner rather than later. Why is an early election possible? It\u2019s all about the numbers. With the Democratic Unionist party\u2019s continued support \u2013 and this is still to be formalised \u2013 Johnson has a working majority of three. This is likely to be eroded further next week, with the Liberal Democrats tipped to take the Brecon and Radnoshire seat from the Tories in a byelection. With the Lib Dems confident of attracting a Conservative defector or two (though nothing is certain) it is perfectly feasible that Johnson could return from the summer recess with no majority at all. What happens then? It all depends, and a number of factors would come into play. Labour has promised to call a formal vote of no confidence in a Johnson government, but will wait until it has the best chance of winning. Under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, if a motion saying \u201cthis house has no confidence in Her Majesty\u2019s government\u201d is passed, there is a 14-day period in which the government can demonstrate it does have support via a confidence motion, or a new administration is formed, or there is an election. An election would not happen immediately, and even if a no-confidence vote were passed immediately after the summer, the earliest possible polling day would be Thursday 24 October. Will Labour do this, and would the motion pass? The party is expected to call one, but with the recess starting this afternoon it will need to wait until September. Labour had thought about an immediate no-confidence vote but calculated that even die-hard Johnson sceptics on the Tory benches would want to give him more than a day in office before kicking him out. But even if the working majority evaporates over the summer there is no guarantee it would pass, with ex-Conservatives having to weigh up if they would want to vote with Labour, thus triggering an election that could bring in a Jeremy Corbyn government. Will Johnson call an election? That also seems distinctly possible, and if there is a seeming uptick in the Conservative poll ratings Johnson could strike. His administration is certainly a campaign-focused one, packed with Vote Leave alumni both in the cabinet seats and among the backroom staff. But at the same time, this cabinet is seemingly not one intended to appeal beyond the ultra-leavers/Tory faithful, so an election could be a gamble. What else could potentially happen? Some more misty-eyed MPs \u2013 mainly Lib Dems or Corbyn-sceptic Labourites \u2013 like to imagine a scenario where Johnson loses the confidence of the Commons, but rather than an election there emerges from the chaos some Borgen-like government of national unity, taking in Conservative and Labour moderates, along with the Lib Dems, SNP and others. This seems a tough ask \u2013 it would involve large numbers of MPs leaving party structures they have been part of for decades \u2013 but many strange political things have happened recently.",

Any idea that the events of 24 July 2019 embody the same timeless magic of the peaceful passing of parliamentary power that constitutional experts like to celebrate is for the birds. For this is an unprecedented partisan seizure of power by the radical part of the Conservative party that seeks Brexit whatever the cost. It is a hard Brexit coup dressed up as politics as usual.</p> \n<p>It is a very particular coup, with very particular implications. It has happened because May failed to deliver Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU on terms that command a majority in parliament. Most of that failure was due to the minority of her own party that always wanted a sharper break with the EU. That minority eventually succeeded in its aim of forcing May out after the collapse of Tory support in the European elections. Fear of the Brexit party, along with the connivance of an untrustworthy backbench Tory chair, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/tory-revolt-how-graham-brady-became-partys-most-powerful-mp\" title=\"\">Graham Brady</a>, sealed May\u2019s fate, to the decisive advantage of Johnson, who was not only the favourite to win but who had thrown in his lot with the party right.</p> \n<p>This in itself might not quite justify the word coup. May\u2019s time, after all, was up. But two further factors help to clinch the argument. The first is the time factor. On Wednesday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-first-speech-pm-panel\" title=\"\">Johnson waffled breathlessly</a> about all the domestic policy changes he intends to make. The reality, though, is that he knows his government has only one task: to deliver Brexit by 31 October. But he has boxed himself in on Brexit. He must choose between a withdrawal deal similar to May\u2019s, which will take time, which the EU is reluctant to concede and which many of his backers and cabinet will oppose, and no deal, which many of his supporters crave, in part because it might destroy the threat from the Brexit party.</p> \n<p>Everything suggests Johnson will choose no deal. That is certainly the takeaway from the second factor, the evidence of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/25/boris-johnson-new-cabinet-prime-minister-ministerial-party-country\" title=\"\">new Johnson cabinet</a>. This is an unbalanced cabinet of mostly second-rate ideologues, many of them with negligible records of ministerial achievement and several of them with very dubious political ethics. All the positions of power are held by Brexit extremists. The rest are political hostages to the hard Brexiters.</p> \n<p>Johnson is not going to repeat May\u2019s error of allowing his enemies to block his Brexit policy or to destabilise his government by resigning. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnson-takes-his-revenge-and-sacks-over-half-the-cabinet\" title=\"\">His new cabinet</a> is an explicit rejection of May\u2019s attempt to hold the Tory party together to deliver Brexit. No deal is thus the logical outcome of May\u2019s overthrow and of Johnson\u2019s victory. But it is not what the nation wants. No deal is opposed both by a majority in parliament, including a significant number of Tories, and by a majority of the public. That is why it is right to call this a hard Brexit coup.</p> \n<p>In the 1790s the French revolution was radicalised by reactionary Europe\u2019s war on the new republic. Johnson and the hard Brexiters today are in something of the position that Danton and Robespierre were in then. They have brought their desperation on themselves by what happened under May.

Slowthai also leads a strong showing for British rappers: Dave is nominated for his debut album, Psychodrama, and Little Simz receives her first Mercury nod for her third studio album, Grey Area. This year\u2019s nominations also contain repeat nominations for Foals, up for their third Mercury prize with Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost, and a second for the 1975, for A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. British guitarist Anna Calvi has been nominated for her third album, Hunter, putting her among a select group of artists \u2013 Wolf Alice, Amy Winehouse, Savages, Laura Mvula and Michael Kiwanuka \u2013 to have seen each of their albums nominated for the prestigious award. The list is completed by Welsh post-punk songwriter Cate Le Bon with her fifth album, Reward, London funk songwriter Nao for her second album, Saturn, and 10-piece collective SEED Ensemble for debut Driftglass.

It is the 28th year of the prize, which this year welcomes five new judges to the committee: Radio 1\u2019s Annie Mac, former Supergrass frontman Gaz Coombes, R&amp;B star Jorja Smith, Glastonbury headliner Stormzy and Vice UK editorial director and Guardian contributor Tshepo Mokoena.

Horse-drawn commercial boats carried goods along the waterways, and at one point the canal network carried nearly 40m tonnes of freight a year. Today, canals are being reclaimed as recreational spaces in densely populated cities \u2013 destinations for city dwellers to run, cycle and socialise. These archive and present-day photos reveal their dramatic transformation.

There had been no \u201cwarning signs\u201d, no evidence of abuse or flashes of temper.</p> <p>According to Roberts, Vicky\u2019s death had been a terrible accident, a \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d. In court, he pleaded not guilty to her murder, claiming they had been having sex on the sofa with a bathrobe cord around Vicky\u2019s neck and she had instructed him, three times, to \u201cpull tighter\u201d.

He hadn\u2019t called an ambulance. He hid Vicky\u2019s body in the garage and told her family she had left him for another man. His phone showed he had been conducting affairs with at least three women, calling one of them constantly on the night in question. A letter written by Vicky was found in the apartment, which revealed that she had discovered something of Roberts\u2019s infidelities and given him a deadline \u2013 which fell on the weekend she died.</p> <p>The jury found Roberts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/sep/21/cheating-newlywed-jailed-strangled-wife\" title=\"\">guilty of murder</a> and he was sentenced to a minimum of 17 years. He has never told the truth about what really happened. \u201cHe took away Vicky, her choices, her chances, her future,\u201d says Vicky\u2019s sister, Lindsey Wynne-Jones. \u201cAnd then he took her dignity. Even now, it\u2019s the \u2018sex game gone wrong\u2019 that gets focused on.

Fiona Mackenzie, an actuary, set up We Can\u2019t Consent to This following the outcry over the so-called \u201crough sex killing\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/23/prosecutors-thought-no-jury-would-accept-natalie-connoolly-was-murdered\" title=\"\">of Natalie Connolly, 26, by her millionaire partner John Broadhurst, 40</a>. Despite the victim having 40 separate injuries, including serious internal trauma, a fractured eye socket and bleach on her face, Broadhurst received a sentence of three years, eight months for manslaughter.</p> <p>\u201cPeople were talking about this defence as if it was one isolated incident and I knew it wasn\u2019t,\u201d says Mackenzie. Although English law does not recognise consent to choking \u2013 or any physical harm \u2013 in the context of consensual sex, the Labour MP Harriet Harman has just announced her intention to have this underlined again in the forthcoming domestic violence bill. \u201cIt needs more emphasis because defence teams are increasingly offering it up, maybe because rough sex has crept into the mainstream,\u201d says Mackenzie. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many women get in touch to say they have been horrified on Tinder dates by partners who have choked them during sex. If you\u2019re dating, it\u2019s expected of you and if you don\u2019t go along with it, you\u2019re boring.\u201d</p> <p>This is how Amber*, now 27, felt when she was first choked during sex in 2012 in Dublin. \u201cI had met a friend of a friend on a night out and we went back to his. He was being rougher with me than I was used to, but I didn\u2019t think anything of it. He grazed his hand on my neck \u2013 again, I didn\u2019t think anything of it \u2013 then he started to squeeze.\u201d</p> <p>The choking wasn\u2019t firm enough to cause Amber much discomfort. \u201cI wanted to be attractive to him. So I just thought: \u2018OK, this is what gets him off, I\u2019ll let him.\u2019\u201d She had just come out of a long-term relationship. \u201cSo I figured: this must be how people have sex now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to be attractive to him. So I just thought: OK, this is what gets him off, I\u2019ll let him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lucy*, 33, who met a man on Tinder last September, describes a similar experience. \u201cHe was a very handsome guy, well turned out,\u201d she says. They went on a date: dinner and drinks. Afterwards, Lucy went to his house, where they moved to the bedroom. \u201cThis is where it gets a little bit blurry,\u201d Lucy recalls. \u201cI was drunk, but I could consent. He asked if he could choke me and I said yes \u2013 I had done it before.\u201d Previously, the choking had not been \u201ca big deal\u201d \u2013 a minor part in the whole experience and comparable to \u201ca bit of hair pulling\u201d; that is to say, a quick and small amount of pain intended to be pleasurable.</p> <p>\u201cBut the next thing I remember is waking up gasping for breath with him on top of me. I\u2019m not sure how long I passed out for. I booked an Uber at 6.30am to get the hell out of there. The next day, I saw the bruises on my chest. We spoke after this and all he said was that, \u2018we both got a bit carried away\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Mackenzie points to two recent strangulation cases that ended in verdicts of manslaughter. Chloe Miazek, 20, who was strangled by Mark Bruce after meeting him at a bus stop and going to his flat in Aberdeen in November 2017<strong>.</strong> Mark Bruce, 32, was <a href=\"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/fp/news/local/man-jailed-for-six-years-after-killing-chloe-miazek-in-north-east-flat2/\" title=\"\">sentenced to six years</a>. His defence argued that \u201cerotic sexual asphyxiation\u201d was something that Miazek had expressed interest in with previous sexual partners.</p> <p>Hannah Pearson, from Lincolnshire, was 16 when she was strangled by James Morton, 24, whom she had met on the day of her death in July 2016. His defence said he was looking to pursue \u201chis sexual thrill without having regard for the consequences of it\u201d. The jury cleared him of murder but he got <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-40670225\" title=\"\">12 years for manslaughter</a>.</p> <p>\u201cBoth those women were very young, and very drunk, killed by much older men they had met just hours before,\u201d Mackenzie says. </p> <p>How did strangulation become so widespread? Autoerotic asphyxia \u2013 when someone restricts oxygen to their own brain for the purposes of arousal \u2013 isn\u2019t new: there have been documented cases since the early 17th century. But, historically, it has been \u201cniche\u201d and an overwhelmingly male pastime. And the serious risks it has always carried can be seen in the two high-profile examples of the deaths of the MP Stephen Milligan and the actor David Carradine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07aef98e7ecc724769c3943777a6a4e9f6acadb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07aef98e7ecc724769c3943777a6a4e9f6acadb3/0_0_1500_1798/834.jpg\" alt=\"Strangulation illo No2, 25 July 2019\" width=\"834\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Now, though, it is women being choked \u2013 Mackenzie hasn\u2019t found a single case of a man killed by a woman in an alleged \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d. And sex surveys, advice forums, social media feeds and women\u2019s magazines show<strong> </strong>the way the practice has become mainstream. \u201cIf blindfolds and role play have veered into vanilla territory, there are still plenty of sex moves \u2026 like choking,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/sex-and-love/a19938109/choking-during-sex/\" title=\"\">suggests Women\u2019s Health</a>. \u201cBreath play, the risque new sex practice gripping millennials,\u201d offers <a href=\"https://www.flare.com/celebrity/entertainment/waiting-to-exhale-breathplay/\" title=\"\">Flare</a>. On elitedaily.com, one sex educator was quoted as saying <a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-how-to-kickstart-kinky-sex-if-youve-fallen-into-a-rut-sexperts-say-15582113\" title=\"\">anyone stuck in a sex rut </a><a href=\"https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-how-to-kickstart-kinky-sex-if-youve-fallen-into-a-rut-sexperts-say-15582113\" title=\"\">could read up on \u201chow to choke your partner safely\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Gail Dines, the feminist thinker and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.culturereframed.org/\" title=\"\">Culture Reframed</a>, believes strangulation has been normalised via two main routes. \u201cFor the men, it\u2019s pornography and for the women, it\u2019s in women\u2019s magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd both of these media genres legitimise it as a form of \u2018play\u2019.\u201d She describes choking as a \u201cnumber one standard act\u201d on porn sites and says women look to porn to \u201csee what men want and they see choking\u201d.</p> <p>The link between strangulation and porn was made almost 20 years ago, when the teacher and classical musician Jane Longhurst was strangled with a pair of tights by her best friend\u2019s boyfriend, Graham Coutts. Coutts (who also used the \u2018consenting sex\u2019 defence) was described in court as having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/04/ukcrime\" title=\"\">an obsession with violent pornography</a>. After the trial, Longhurst\u2019s family campaigned for a ban on violent porn, which eventually led to <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2008/4/section/63\" title=\"\">section 63 of the 2008 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act</a>, making it illegal to possess an extreme pornographic image which included acts that threaten a person\u2019s life. However, the cases that have come to court have been ones involving bestiality or child abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s not used for scenes of violence, strangulation and rape, which is what was intended,\u201d says Edwards.</p> <p>Erika Lust, one of the world\u2019s only female porn directors, agrees that strangulation and choking scenes now dominate porn. \u201cFace slapping, choking, gagging and spitting has become the alpha and omega of any porn scene and not within a BDSM context,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are presented as standard ways to have sex when, in fact, they are niches.\u201d </p> <p>When a direct threat to life is slowly normalised, \u201cit means that a woman whose partner chokes her might not report it \u2013 and if she does, it might go nowhere,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cIt means that if a woman dies this way, judges and juries feel \u2018this is how people have sex now\u2019 and questions aren\u2019t always asked.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Face slapping, choking, gagging and spitting has become the alpha and omega of any porn scene</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Lust points out that if sex education is inadequate, \u201cyoung people will go to the internet for answers. Many people\u2019s first exposure to sex is hardcore porn\u201d. This, she says, teaches kids \u201cthat men should be rough and demanding, and that degradation is standard.\u201d</p> <p>One young man who spoke to the Guardian for this piece said he chokes his girlfriend, and has done for several years, \u201cbecause she likes it\u201d. Days later, he got in touch again. \u201cI thought about our conversation and asked her about it. She said she doesn\u2019t actually like it; she thought I liked it. But the thing is, I don\u2019t: I thought it\u2019s what she wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Sarah* was a witness in a \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d case that ended with a not guilty verdict. She lived in the flat below the victim \u2013 someone who had spent time in prison for drugs and sex work offences and seemed warm, friendly and very vulnerable.</p> <p>One afternoon, Sarah heard arguments interspersed by laughter upstairs. Her neighbour shouted: \u201cGet off me!\u201d There was a sound of falling to the floor, followed by scuffling, then sex, then quiet. Later that evening, Sarah went upstairs because water was dripping through her ceiling. Her neighbour\u2019s door was ajar, the kitchen tap left on \u2013 she turned it off and went to the bedroom.</p> <p>\u201cI saw my neighbour hanging from a rope,\u201d she says. A man slept beside her. Sarah says that one police officer asked her if her neighbour was \u201cthe local entertainment\u201d.</p> <p>The case took a long time to come to trial. The victim \u2013 who had more than 30 injuries \u2013 was a troubled woman, the jury was told. She had sent \u201cdirty\u201d texts. The man who had been sleeping beside her insisted that he had only ever had \u201cnormal sex\u201d. Although Sarah \u2013 and another neighbour \u2013 thought there had been two men in the flat, no one else was charged. The sex game gone wrong was something the police or Crown Prosecution Service came up with, not the defence. \u201cIt felt that the police thought she had somehow asked for it,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cThe \u2018sex game gone wrong\u2019 story was a way of blaming everyone and no one.\u201d The sleeping man was found not guilty. Nothing was ever explained.</p> <p>The dead woman was a mother, a sister, a daughter \u2013 all her family were at the trial. Sarah cannot imagine the impact on them. \u201cI can see that she would be considered a difficult victim to present to a jury,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, as far as I know, \u2018Get off me\u2019 were very possibly the last words she spoke.\u201d</p> <p>The Wynne-Jones family did get the verdict they wanted \u2013 Roberts is 10 years into his sentence, but to Vicky\u2019s mother, it feels like no time at all. \u201cFor the people who have to go through what we did and then walk away with a charge of manslaughter and a four-year sentence \u2013 that doesn\u2019t put a lot of worth on a person\u2019s life.\u201d</p> <p><em>* Some names have been changed</em></p>",

Daniel Lancaster claimed that Banks \u201cenjoyed being throttled during intercourse\u201d. He was not found guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter and given a four-year sentence. Since December last year, a group of women have attempted to gather \u201csex games gone wrong\u201d defence killings under one place \u2013 the website We Can\u2019t Consent to This. In the decade since Vicky\u2019s murder, such killings have risen by 90%. Two thirds involve strangulation. Strangulation \u2013 fatal and non-fatal \u2013 \u201csqueezing\u201d, \u201cneck compression\u201d or, as some call, it \u201cbreath-play\u201d \u2013 is highly gendered. On average, one woman in the UK is strangled to death by her partner every two weeks, according to Women\u2019s Aid. It is a frequent feature of non-fatal domestic assault, as well as rape and robbery where women are the victims. It is striking how seldom it is seen in crimes against men. Numerous studies have shown that non-fatal strangulation is one of the highest markers for future homicide, which is why Australia, New Zealand, Canada and most US states have developed preventative legislation to strengthen police, prosecutorial and sentencing policies that surround it. In most US states, for example, it is now compulsory for police to charge strangulation assaults as felonies. Yet in the UK, they can fall under battery \u2013 the mildest assault possible.

So I just thought: \u2018OK, this is what gets him off, I\u2019ll let him.\u2019\u201d She had just come out of a long-term relationship. \u201cSo I figured: this must be how people have sex now.\u201d Lucy*, 33, who met a man on Tinder last September, describes a similar experience. \u201cHe was a very handsome guy, well turned out,\u201d she says. They went on a date: dinner and drinks. Afterwards, Lucy went to his house, where they moved to the bedroom. \u201cThis is where it gets a little bit blurry,\u201d Lucy recalls. \u201cI was drunk, but I could consent. He asked if he could choke me and I said yes \u2013 I had done it before.\u201d Previously, the choking had not been \u201ca big deal\u201d \u2013 a minor part in the whole experience and comparable to \u201ca bit of hair pulling\u201d; that is to say, a quick and small amount of pain intended to be pleasurable. \u201cBut the next thing I remember is waking up gasping for breath with him on top of me. I\u2019m not sure how long I passed out for. I booked an Uber at 6.30am to get the hell out of there. The next day, I saw the bruises on my chest. We spoke after this and all he said was that, \u2018we both got a bit carried away\u2019.\u201d Mackenzie points to two recent strangulation cases that ended in verdicts of manslaughter. Chloe Miazek, 20, who was strangled by Mark Bruce after meeting him at a bus stop and going to his flat in Aberdeen in November 2017. Mark Bruce, 32, was sentenced to six years. His defence argued that \u201cerotic sexual asphyxiation\u201d was something that Miazek had expressed interest in with previous sexual partners. Hannah Pearson, from Lincolnshire, was 16 when she was strangled by James Morton, 24, whom she had met on the day of her death in July 2016. His defence said he was looking to pursue \u201chis sexual thrill without having regard for the consequences of it\u201d. The jury cleared him of murder but he got 12 years for manslaughter. \u201cBoth those women were very young, and very drunk, killed by much older men they had met just hours before,\u201d Mackenzie says. How did strangulation become so widespread? Autoerotic asphyxia \u2013 when someone restricts oxygen to their own brain for the purposes of arousal \u2013 isn\u2019t new: there have been documented cases since the early 17th century. But, historically, it has been \u201cniche\u201d and an overwhelmingly male pastime. And the serious risks it has always carried can be seen in the two high-profile examples of the deaths of the MP Stephen Milligan and the actor David Carradine. Now, though, it is women being choked \u2013 Mackenzie hasn\u2019t found a single case of a man killed by a woman in an alleged \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d. And sex surveys, advice forums, social media feeds and women\u2019s magazines show the way the practice has become mainstream. \u201cIf blindfolds and role play have veered into vanilla territory, there are still plenty of sex moves \u2026 like choking,\u201d suggests Women\u2019s Health. \u201cBreath play, the risque new sex practice gripping millennials,\u201d offers Flare. On elitedaily.com, one sex educator was quoted as saying anyone stuck in a sex rut could read up on \u201chow to choke your partner safely\u201d. Gail Dines, the feminist thinker and CEO of Culture Reframed, believes strangulation has been normalised via two main routes. \u201cFor the men, it\u2019s pornography and for the women, it\u2019s in women\u2019s magazines,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd both of these media genres legitimise it as a form of \u2018play\u2019.\u201d She describes choking as a \u201cnumber one standard act\u201d on porn sites and says women look to porn to \u201csee what men want and they see choking\u201d. The link between strangulation and porn was made almost 20 years ago, when the teacher and classical musician Jane Longhurst was strangled with a pair of tights by her best friend\u2019s boyfriend, Graham Coutts. Coutts (who also used the \u2018consenting sex\u2019 defence) was described in court as having an obsession with violent pornography. After the trial, Longhurst\u2019s family campaigned for a ban on violent porn, which eventually led to section 63 of the 2008 Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, making it illegal to possess an extreme pornographic image which included acts that threaten a person\u2019s life. However, the cases that have come to court have been ones involving bestiality or child abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s not used for scenes of violence, strangulation and rape, which is what was intended,\u201d says Edwards. Erika Lust, one of the world\u2019s only female porn directors, agrees that strangulation and choking scenes now dominate porn. \u201cFace slapping, choking, gagging and spitting has become the alpha and omega of any porn scene and not within a BDSM context,\u201d she says. \u201cThese are presented as standard ways to have sex when, in fact, they are niches.\u201d When a direct threat to life is slowly normalised, \u201cit means that a woman whose partner chokes her might not report it \u2013 and if she does, it might go nowhere,\u201d says Edwards. \u201cIt means that if a woman dies this way, judges and juries feel \u2018this is how people have sex now\u2019 and questions aren\u2019t always asked.\u201d Lust points out that if sex education is inadequate, \u201cyoung people will go to the internet for answers. Many people\u2019s first exposure to sex is hardcore porn\u201d. This, she says, teaches kids \u201cthat men should be rough and demanding, and that degradation is standard.\u201d One young man who spoke to the Guardian for this piece said he chokes his girlfriend, and has done for several years, \u201cbecause she likes it\u201d. Days later, he got in touch again. \u201cI thought about our conversation and asked her about it. She said she doesn\u2019t actually like it; she thought I liked it. But the thing is, I don\u2019t: I thought it\u2019s what she wanted.\u201d Sarah* was a witness in a \u201csex game gone wrong\u201d case that ended with a not guilty verdict. She lived in the flat below the victim \u2013 someone who had spent time in prison for drugs and sex work offences and seemed warm, friendly and very vulnerable. One afternoon, Sarah heard arguments interspersed by laughter upstairs. Her neighbour shouted: \u201cGet off me!\u201d There was a sound of falling to the floor, followed by scuffling, then sex, then quiet. Later that evening, Sarah went upstairs because water was dripping through her ceiling. Her neighbour\u2019s door was ajar, the kitchen tap left on \u2013 she turned it off and went to the bedroom. \u201cI saw my neighbour hanging from a rope,\u201d she says. A man slept beside her. Sarah says that one police officer asked her if her neighbour was \u201cthe local entertainment\u201d. The case took a long time to come to trial. The victim \u2013 who had more than 30 injuries \u2013 was a troubled woman, the jury was told. She had sent \u201cdirty\u201d texts. The man who had been sleeping beside her insisted that he had only ever had \u201cnormal sex\u201d. Although Sarah \u2013 and another neighbour \u2013 thought there had been two men in the flat, no one else was charged. The sex game gone wrong was something the police or Crown Prosecution Service came up with, not the defence. \u201cIt felt that the police thought she had somehow asked for it,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cThe \u2018sex game gone wrong\u2019 story was a way of blaming everyone and no one.\u201d The sleeping man was found not guilty. Nothing was ever explained. The dead woman was a mother, a sister, a daughter \u2013 all her family were at the trial. Sarah cannot imagine the impact on them. \u201cI can see that she would be considered a difficult victim to present to a jury,\u201d she says. \u201cHowever, as far as I know, \u2018Get off me\u2019 were very possibly the last words she spoke.\u201d The Wynne-Jones family did get the verdict they wanted \u2013 Roberts is 10 years into his sentence, but to Vicky\u2019s mother, it feels like no time at all. \u201cFor the people who have to go through what we did and then walk away with a charge of manslaughter and a four-year sentence \u2013 that doesn\u2019t put a lot of worth on a person\u2019s life.\u201d * Some names have been changed",

      "bodyText": "Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan police commissioner, has been caught up in the royal family dispute between Princess Haya of Jordan and her estranged husband, Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai. The latest twist in the domestic row is allegedly over payments to Quest Global Ltd, a private risk management and security firm with headquarters in central London. The company chairman is Lord Stevens, a distinguished senior policemen who led a series of inquiries into collusion in Northern Ireland. Since joining Quest he has conducted investigations into equine doping, corruption in Premier League football transfers and F1 racing. Documents seen by the Guardian, show that payments made to the company dating back to 2016 are being challenged by the government of Dubai\u2019s legal affairs department. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Quest. Princess Haya, the daughter of the former King Hussein of Jordan, is locked in a legal battle with her husband, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai and the vice-president of the United Arab Emirates, over the welfare of their two children. An audit of accounts controlled by government and entities funded by Sheikh Mohammed \u201chave raised serious concerns in relation to payments made to Quest Global going back as far as 2016\u201d, according to a letter sent by Dubai\u2019s legal affairs department to Martin Smith, CEO of Quest Global. Examination of the accounts has resulted in the sheikh\u2019s \u201caudit unit\u201d \u201cconducting a full audit of all past payments made to Quest Global\u201d.

The dispute between Princess Haya and Sheikh Mohammed will be heard in the high court on 30 July and 31 July. She is reported to have fled Dubai and is understood to be living in London in fear of kidnap after the alleged abductions of several close relatives. The most notorious alleged disappearance involved the 33-year-old Princess Latifa, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s daughter, who allegedly escaped Dubai before being seized off the coast of India by commandos last year and forcibly returned home.

      "bodyText": "Nissan has announced it will cut 12,500 jobs globally over the next three years but the carmaker\u2019s Sunderland plant appears to have avoided redundancies. The Japanese company revealed it would cut almost one in 10 of its workforce after profit was virtually wiped out in the first quarter of its financial year. Nissan, which employs about 8,000 people in the UK and 139,000 worldwide, did not disclose where the cuts would fall. However, the Financial Times reported that an analysts\u2019 presentation referred to an initial round of 2,420 job cuts in the US and Mexico, 2,540 in India and Indonesia, 880 in Japan, and 470 in Spain. Trade union sources said they were hopeful no more jobs would go at Sunderland on top of 500 voluntary redundancies already taking place. There have been doubts for the future of the Sunderland plant, the UK\u2019s largest car factory, with Brexit adding to wider pressures on the carmaker. In February, Nissan cited uncertainty about Britain\u2019s departure from the EU when it shifted production of its X-Trail model from Sunderland. Nissan produces about 2,000 cars a day in Sunderland, where the company employs about 7,000 people and is one of the north-east\u2019s most important employers. The plant is highly efficient but it relies on frictionless trade in Europe to receive millions of parts arriving every day. Japan\u2019s second-biggest carmaker announced the job cuts at the same time as results showing its profit nearly erased by falling sales and rising costs in the first quarter. Operating profit in the three months to the end of June fell 98.5% to 1.6bn yen (\u00a311.9m) as revenue fell 12.7% to 2.4bn yen. More expensive raw materials, currency swings and spending to meet regulatory requirements pushed up costs. As part of the cuts programme Nissan will also reduce its global production capacity by 10% by the end of 2022 and cut the number of models it produces by 10%. The company has been hit by falling sales in Japan and the US, where it is under pressure to discount prices to better compete with rivals. It is also trying to recover from the arrest last year in Japan of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn over alleged misuse of company funds, which he denies. Ghosn led Nissan\u2019s aggressive drive for market share in the US that has left it with a cheap image and thin profit margins. Hiroto Saikawa, Nissan\u2019s chief executive, said the job cuts would affect 14 factories, some of which could close. In May Nissan said jobs would go at eight sites, including Spain, where the company makes trucks and vans, and Indonesia. \u201cWe are mainly targeting sites where we made investments to produce compact cars under the Power 88 plan,\u201d Saikawa said, according to Reuters. \u201cProfitability is very poor at the moment.\u201d Power 88 was the name for Ghosn\u2019s aggressive push to achieve an 8% worldwide market share and 8% operating margin. Other countries where Nissan produces compact cars include Mexico, Russia, France and Thailand. Carmakers globally are experiencing falling sales caused by trade disputes, the slowing global economy, Brexit uncertainty and tougher emissions regulations. If, as expected, Sunderland avoids further job cuts in Nissan\u2019s latest round it will be welcome news for the embattled UK car industry, which faces uncertainty over Brexit as well as problems affecting the industry in general. Ford is shutting its Bridgend plant in south Wales with the loss of 1,700 jobs as the US company cuts 12,000 jobs in Europe. Honda\u2019s closure of its Swindon plant will lead to 7,000 job losses with thousands more under threat in the supply chain. Jaguar Land Rover is also cutting thousands of jobs. Car production in Britain has already declined 9% since the 2016 Brexit referendum and could halve if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, a recent study predicted.

Now, the ability of Lam\u2019s administration to govern has come into question. \u201cThe people of Hong Kong are already on the verge of collapse \u2026 the police no longer protect the public [and] the Hong Kong government is incapable of governance,\u201d said a letter signed by more than 100 civil servants from 23 departments that issued \u201csevere condemnation\u201d of authorities. Lam, who was last seen in public on Monday when she gave widely criticised comments to the press, said police would investigate the incident. The police have arrested 12 people in connection with the attack, on suspicion of \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d. No charges have yet been made. \u201cThe government is under a lot, a lot of pressure,\u201d said Joseph Cheng, a retired political scientist based in Hong Kong. \u201cPeople are wondering if the administration can even be effective in maintaining law and order.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The government has attempted to fend off a formal inquiry into controversial meetings between Angus Taylor and the environment department over endangered grasslands by producing a letter that purports to show the minister was acting in the interests of his constituents and not himself. But the letter, which was said to have come from a concerned farmer, was actually from a lobby group, the NSW Farmers Association, and was written nearly six months after the meetings were held. Confusion over the letter led to the crossbench voting down a Labor motion for a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of Taylor and then environment minister Josh Frydenberg. As details of the letter became clear, the opposition vowed to move for a second vote on Monday. The inquiry would consider the conduct of the ministers in relation to endangered grasslands that were at the centre of an environment department investigation into a company Taylor part-owns. Labor and the Greens had earlier increased pressure on the government over Taylor\u2019s 2017 meeting with environment officials, with senators Penny Wong and Larissa Waters calling his actions \u201ccorrupt\u201d \u2013 comments they were asked to withdraw. The interrogation follows a Guardian Australia investigation that revealed Taylor met officials from Frydenberg\u2019s office and department to discuss the federal government\u2019s designation of the critically endangered grasslands known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands. Frydenberg was the environment minister at the time. The meetings occurred at the same time that New South Wales and federal investigations were under way into the poisoning of about 30 hectares that contained the grasses on a property in the state\u2019s Monaro region owned by Jam Land Pty Ltd. One of the directors of that company is Richard Taylor, the minister\u2019s brother, and the minister himself holds an interest in the firm via his family investment company, Gufee. After lobbying by Taylor, Frydenberg\u2019s office canvassed whether protections for the grasslands could be watered down and if the change had to be published. A Labor motion in the Senate on Thursday for an inquiry into the matter was defeated after crossbenchers, including the Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick, voted against it. Labor tried to postpone their motion until next week but the government, which had secured the numbers to block it, brought it on for a vote. But Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s Leader in the Senate, said she would move again for an inquiry on Monday. \u201cThey might want me to withdraw the word \u2018corrupt\u2019 but I reckon I know what people out there would say,\u201d Wong said. \u201c\u2026 The government want to shut it down.\u201d Before voting against the inquiry, Patrick, who has made integrity matters a personal focus since joining the Senate, told the chamber he had been \u201cshown evidence that Taylor was asked to make representation on behalf of some constituents\u201d. Taylor has repeatedly stated he sought the meeting in his capacity as the member for Hume and was acting on behalf of constituents. Patrick said the evidence he had seen was a letter. That letter was tabled later in the day and is dated 3 October 2017 \u2013 almost seven months after Taylor\u2019s meeting on 20 March 2017. Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally accused Patrick of substituting himself as \u201cjudge and jury\u201d for the entire Senate. \u201cIf we had an inquiry, these things could be put out in an evidentiary way and the inquiry could come to a considered position,\u201d she said. She said the government\u2019s response had been \u201cweak as water\u201d. \u201cWhat we have is an allegation of corrupt conduct by a minister of the crown in a government that is refusing to bring in a federal national integrity commission, in a government that sometimes sits on the other side and yells out allegations about us over here but goes as weak as water when it comes to putting evidence before an inquiry,\u201d she said. For the third straight day, Labor used question time in the House of Representatives to ask Taylor why he met with environment officials and Frydenberg, why Jam Land Pty Ltd was not listed on his declaration of interests, and why a staff member from the department unit that was investigating the alleged land clearing was at the meeting. The leader of opposition business, Tony Burke, moved to suspend standing orders for Taylor to answer Labor\u2019s questions, but the motion was defeated because of the government\u2019s majority in the house. In response to earlier questions from Labor MPs, Taylor told the parliament he \u201cdidn\u2019t ask for, nor indeed know that a compliance officer was present at the meeting\u201d. \u201cI make absolutely no apology for seeking and receiving briefing on policies that affect the farmers in my electorate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I am a proud farmer in my electorate and I will always seek and receive briefings on policies that impact them.\u201d The letter from the NSW Farmers Association refers to concerns of farmers, but does not name any individuals. The letter says: \u201cSince the amendment of the listing there has been an alleged breach of the the EPBC Act and heightened concerned (sic) from farmers in the regions covered by the listing.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The attorney-general\u2019s department will probe whether Confucius Institutes at Australian universities require registration as a source of foreign influence after revelations about the extent of Chinese control of teaching standards. On Thursday, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age reported that contracts signed by four universities state that they \u2018\u2018must accept\u201d the assessment of the Confucius Institute headquarters on the teaching quality at the centres. The Confucius Institutes are joint ventures between the host university, a partner university in China, and Hanban, an agency under China\u2019s education ministry which supplies funding, staff and resources. In a statement, the education minister, Dan Tehan, said he had spoken to Universities Australia on Thursday to stress \u201cthe importance of all universities that host foreign institutes complying with the foreign influence transparency scheme\u201d. The scheme, created in the term of the last parliament, requires people and bodies acting on behalf of foreign governments and related entities \u2013 including lawful activities \u2013 to sign up to a public register. Registrations have included the United States Studies Centre and the Perth US Asia Centre, but so far none of the 13 universities that host the China-funded Confucius Institute centres have registered. On Thursday, the Universities Australia chief executive, Catriona Jackson, said universities were \u201clooking carefully at their agreements with foreign entities to ensure they comply with the new laws\u201d. Tehan said he will meet vice chancellors in early August to discuss the issue and ensure Australian universities uphold institutional autonomy and control of curriculum and standards. \u201cThe attorney-general\u2019s department has already been undertaking inquiries with a number of universities over recent months to ascertain whether certain arrangements should be registered,\u201d he said. \u201cThe attorney-general has asked his department to specifically examine the arrangements between Confucius Institutes and universities in order to ensure compliance with the [scheme].\u201d \u201cThe Australian government expects our universities to have robust mechanisms in place to ensure international education partnerships comply with Australian laws, education quality standards and academic freedoms.\u201d Jackson noted that although the FITS came into effect on 10 December, amendments in April had clarified the scope of communications activities covered by the scheme. Communications activities are registrable under the scheme only if undertaken for the purpose of political or governmental influence. Jackson said the university sector had \u201cworked constructively with the attorney-general and his department as the government crafted and refined this legislation last year\u201d. \u201cAustralia\u2019s universities also strongly uphold their institutional autonomy and control of curriculum and standards.\u201d Three of the universities cited in the original report \u2013 Griffith University, La Trobe and Charles Darwin University \u2013 reportedly defended the arrangements by noting that Confucius Institute centres do not have a direct role in any academic certification of the universities, but rather provide cultural and language programs. The fourth university, University of Queensland, reportedly said its agreement expired in April and the university is negotiating changes with explicit commitments to university autonomy over all content, standards, admissions, examinations, staffing and academic freedom \u201cin connection with the Confucius Institute and all courses and projects it offers\u201d.",

If this wasn\u2019t tricky enough, a small but significant section of Tory MPs openly detest Johnson, and will not want to help him out - and with his cabinet sackings, the \u2018Gaukward squad\u2019 of former senior cabinet members set on blocking a no-deal Brexit swelled in ranks.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Loosening the purse strings</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Such was the fiscal largesse on display from both Johnson and Jeremy Hunt during the hustings process that much as he will seek to kick any decisions towards an autumn budget, voters \u2013 especially Tory members \u2013 will be expecting both tax cuts and more spending on areas such as education and the police.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Everything non-Brexit</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>This might sound glib, but there is a lot to consider \u2013 during the three-plus years of Brexit introversion May\u2019s government failed to properly grasp any of a series of long-term, pressing national problems: the crisis in social care; the future of the NHS; a climate emergency; the increasingly insecure future of work; a broken housing market; rampant poverty, including among many working people. This is a huge workload for any new administration.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Being prime ministerial</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Critics might say this is Johnson\u2019s single biggest challenge. The leadership process has shown that while he endlessly harked back to supposed successes as London mayor \u2013 an often ceremonial role with relatively few powers \u2013 Johnson was notably quieter about his period as foreign secretary.</p>\n    <p>Being prime minister is like the latter, to a factor of 10 \u2013 a never-ending succession of red boxes containing vital documents, of urgent briefings, of a whole system hanging on your decisions. Johnson has a tendency to ignore advice, pluck statistics out of the air and rely on sudden, cheap glibness.

      "bodyText": "The new prime minister \u201cacted decisively\u201d in sacking more than half the cabinet, the incoming chief secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, has said, as Boris Johnson commenced the first meeting of his top team. Johnson launched a ruthless clearout of Theresa May\u2019s frontbench on Wednesday, packing his team with Vote Leave veterans and rightwing free marketers. The job of home secretary went to Priti Patel, who advocated the return of capital punishment as recently as 2011, and the Treasury to the Thatcher devotee Sajid Javid. Dominic Raab, who previously described feminists as \u201cobnoxious bigots\u201d, is the new foreign secretary. \u201cThe prime minister said yesterday from Downing Street that he wanted to show strong leadership, act decisively and change this country for the better and that\u2019s what we saw yesterday,\u201d Sunak told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cHe wants a cabinet that reflects modern Britain and that\u2019s exactly what we got. It draws on talent from across the parliamentary party in terms of women and ethnic minorities. It better reflects the country that we wish to serve, but crucially it \u2026 supports the prime minister\u2019s priority to deliver Brexit by the end of October.\u201d Sunak said conversations between Johnson and outgoing cabinet ministers that had been reported to him were \u201cwarm and collegial\u201d. Opening the first meeting of his cabinet on Thursday morning, Johnson reportedly told the room it was \u201cwonderful to see this new team assembled here\u201d that respected the \u201cdepth and breadth of talent in our extraordinary party\u201d. \u201cAs you all know we have a momentous task ahead of us, at a pivotal moment in our country\u2019s history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are now committed, all of us, to leaving the European Union on 31 October or indeed earlier \u2013 no ifs, no buts. But we are not going to wait until 31 October to get on with a fantastic new agenda for our country, and that means delivering the priorities of the people.\u201d Johnson will address parliament for the first time as prime minister later on Thursday, setting out his plans for government. According to the Sun, he has chosen to move into the four-bedroom flat at No 11 Downing Street with his partner, Carrie Symonds, leaving Javid the smaller apartment at No 10. Also speaking to the Today programme, the MP Nick Boles, who quit the Conservative party in March over its \u201cfailure to compromise\u201d on Brexit, said the cabinet appointments proved that \u201cthe Conservative party has now been fully taken over, top to bottom, by the hard right\u201d. \u201cThey are basically turning themselves into the Brexit party in order to hold off Nigel Farage,\u201d he said. Boles said that while two of the great offices of state were now held by people from minority ethnic backgrounds, \u201cthe individuals concerned are from the hard right, they are Thatcherites, they are no-deal Brexiters\u201d. Responding to Boles\u2019s comments later on the programme, the former Conservative leader and Johnson supporter Iain Duncan Smith said it was wrong to equate a pro-Brexit position with far-right politics. \u201cIf you look at the people that support Brexit, it\u2019s a complete mix \u2013 from people who are communists on one side to people who are conservatives, [and] you\u2019ve got Nigel Farage on the other side.\u201d He said London-born Patel had been given her new job because it was important to have people in the cabinet who were committed to delivering Brexit and because she represented \u201cthe changing nature of Britain\u201d. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman and she\u2019s also come from the Indian subcontinent,\u201d he said. Speaking to the BBC, the former French European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said Johnson\u2019s election would not change the EU\u2019s position. \u201cYou have changed your prime minister, but we have not changed our minds,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is within the withdrawal agreement is consistent with priorities we have in common, the fate of our citizens, the need to protect the Good Friday agreement \u2013 that there is no hard border on the island of Ireland, that we protect the single market and the fact that you have financial commitments that need to be settled.

Fans of the classic 1974 movie The Longest Yard, starring Burt Reynolds, might think the story of a prisoner football team is pure fantasy, but Sing Sing Correctional Facility in New York fielded the <a href=\"https://www.si.com/vault/1967/01/23/543318/fight-on-old-sing-sing-u\">Sing Sing Black Sheep football team in the 1930s</a>. As early as 1912, <a href=\"https://baseballhall.org/discover/short-stops/baseball-behind-bars\">prisoners played baseball at Atlanta\u2019s Federal Penitentiary</a>, and other baseball prison programs soon sprang up at Sing Sing and San Quentin in California. The Sing Sing baseball team even played an exhibition against the 1929 New York Yankees team that featured Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Since 1931, prison rodeos have entertained inmates and the general public. <a href=\"http://www.txprisonmuseum.org/articles/rodeo_history.html\">The Texas Prison Rodeo</a> was held in Huntsville, Texas, from 1931 until 1986, but ended due to budgetary concerns. <a href=\"https://www.angolamuseum.org/angola-prison-rodeo\">The Angola Prison Rodeo</a> at the Louisiana State Penitentiary opened in 1965 and is still running. It has grown so popular the prison built a 10,000 seat arena in 2000.</p> <p>Prisoners have been running in prisons long before the 1,000 Mile Club formed. Dave McGillivray, the race director of the Boston Marathon, started the first and only USA Track &amp; Field sanctioned running club inside a prison at Walpole State Prison in Massachusetts in the 1980s. His association with the prison started on 14 June 1980, when McGillivray was the only non-inmate to run an eight-mile race against 20 to 30 inmates.</p> <p>McGillivray kept coming back, organizing three to four more 10Ks and a marathon at the prison involving outsiders and inmates. Thirty to 40 inmates paid a registration fee to officially register the club with USATF, but the prison administration became suspicious of the club and shut it down after about five or six years. Even though McGillivray received criticism for helping prisoners, he said, \u201cMy theory is this: Some of these guys are going to get out, and I\u2019d rather have them better on the way out than they were on the way in.\u201d</p> <p>Mike Crofts, CEO of the London-based<a href=\"https://www.3pillarsproject.com/\"> 3Pillars Project</a>, agrees. \u201cReleasing mentally healthy citizens is beneficial for all of us,\u201d he explained. The 3Pillars Project is an intensive eight-week rugby program offered in five British prisons. The program uses a holistic approach to assist inmates by providing mentors who develop action plans with participants, conduct anger management discussions and leadership coaching, assist with CV writing, and discuss course work and life in general.</p> <p>Crofts, an officer in the British Army for eight years, founded the program after volunteering as a rugby coach at the<a href=\"http://www.justice.gov.uk/contacts/prison-finder/feltham\"> Feltham Young Offenders Institution</a> in South West London. The youth prison holds offenders between the ages of 15 and 21. Crofts saw potential where others might have found despair. He said, \u201cI felt that, if given the right mentoring and development, they could achieve as much as some of the fantastic young men I had served in Afghanistan with.\u201d</p> <p>The 3Pillars Project teaches leadership and is demanding of its participants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cc1927c0caf0c98cb3706613495e372a482e62da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc1927c0caf0c98cb3706613495e372a482e62da/0_0_1200_675/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The 1,000 Mile Running Club began in 2005\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 1,000 Mile Running Club began in 2005</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Ruona</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t turn anybody away, but we do set very high standards for all participants,\u201d Crofts said. \u201cThey love the idea that we demand more and believe in them to achieve.\u201d Course graduates have the opportunity to serve as assistant coaches and train other participants while they are still in custody. One young man completed the first course in 2016 and worked for the program on day-release from an open prison. He is now released and living with his family, and the 3Pillars program continues to support him by employing him as a coach.</p> <p>The program culminates in a rugby match against staff or an outside team, sometimes both, and it is much more than a fun game for the participants. \u201cThe sense of pride, unity, and self-worth that the young men display after playing in a match together is unrivaled,\u201d Crofts said. \u201cSome of them have never been accepted onto teams before.\u201d</p> <p>The benefits of prison sports are not limited to prisoners, according to Michael Kremer, director and head coach of the San Quentin Baseball Program. Unlike many prison sports programs, San Quentin\u2019s baseball team regularly plays home games against outside teams. Kremer\u2019s first experience with San Quentin\u2019s team was as a player for an outside team in 2015. He describes it as \u201ca total one-of-a-kind experience\u201d that allowed him to use baseball \u201cas a bond to connect with people that I otherwise would\u2019ve had no link to.\u201d</p> <p>Kremer does not believe his experience as a player was unique. \u201cThere\u2019s a really great give and take between inmates and outsiders,\u201d he said. \u201cThe outsiders that come in have an even more transformational experience from the baseball program. The opportunity for the outside world to have contact and put faces to people who are behind bars and interact with them and realize they are not monsters really could have a fundamental impact on people in terms of how they think about criminal justice issues or the prison system.\u201d</p> <p>Kremer also sees baseball\u2019s benefits for his San Quentin players, such as connecting them with the outside world and taking them out of the mindset of just surviving prison. He believes forming relationships with people who aren\u2019t tainted by prison encourages prosocial behavior for his players. Baseball also gives his players hope and a reason to obey prison rules.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of power in players having something to strive for and to hope for, and baseball is a privilege for these guys,\u201d Kremer said. \u201cThey know that they have to behave well and stay out of trouble in order to participate in the program. It gives them an element of commitment and positivity and hope that they otherwise might not have in what can be a pretty bleak setting inside of a prison.\u201d</p> <p>Organized prison sports also can reduce racial tensions. Kremer said, \u201cOn the baseball diamond, racial lines totally go away,\u201d and inmates can form friendships that would be unlikely elsewhere in prison where certain areas are allocated to specific races.</p> <p>Taylor never saw any racial animosity during his time with the 1,000 Mile Club, and Ruona agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve got roughly 30% Caucasian, 30% black, 30% Hispanic, and then the other 10% are Asian, Arabic, and other races. They all get along well. They seem to support each other,\u201d said Ruona.</p> <p>Cleo Cloman requested a transfer to San Quentin after 15 years in prison because he heard it had a baseball team. He missed the sport his father introduced him to at the age of five and that he played through high school. Baseball helped Cloman find a sense of purpose again.</p> <p>\u201cBaseball is my passion,\u201d Cloman said. \u201cBaseball is a tool. Baseball is my love. Baseball is my understanding. Baseball is my peace. And I know I find that between the foul lines.\u201d</p> <p>After six years at San Quentin, Cloman was released on parole in May 2017 and has been working as a plumber for a year. He has stayed out of trouble and credits his experience playing baseball in prison as a key to his success.</p> <p>\u201cIn prison, our object was to go home, but in order to go home you had to know how to deal with reality at home,\u201d Cloman said. \u201cWe had to check ourselves and learn how to be different, and baseball taught me how to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Although there is <a href=\"https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__assets.publishing.service.gov.uk_government_uploads_system_uploads_attachment-5Fdata_file_733184_a-2Dsporting-2Dchance-2Dan-2Dindependent-2Dreview-2Dsport-2Din-2Djustice.pdf&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=l45AxH-kUV29SRQusp9vYR0n1GycN4_2jInuKy6zbqQ&amp;r=sDKF2zbCGlF8porMJlznG9uajAA2-FgQyG551jxWDdc&amp;m=e-V2jmYeuDQhjjryKSe04PanpSF4mDlyaynWrn7_Wuo&amp;s=Uesao6QtdSPomK-9AbwPLS2zwleY9fo4e4EeCBut_tI&amp;e=\">limited empirical evidence</a> of a direct causal relationship between prison sport participation and recidivism rates,<strong> </strong>Cloman\u2019s success during the last two years appears the norm for the San Quentin runners and baseball players.</p> <p>Kremer said none of the six or seven baseball players who have been released in the four years he has been involved with the baseball program have reoffended.</p> <p>Ruona has seen similar success during his 14 years with the 1,000 Mile Club. He knows of only one former runner who is back in prison (and happens to be running at San Quentin again). \u201cWe really did not have a lot of guys being released for the first seven or eight years that I was coaching the Club. Recently, the numbers have increased substantially,\u201d Ruona said. \u201cI know of at least 30 guys who have been released and are still out of prison as far as I know.\u201d</p> <p>Although it\u2019s only been a few months since his release, Taylor is thankful the running community outside of prison is as welcoming as the 1,000 Mile Club.</p> <p>\u201cThe running community is beautiful,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel no judgment, nothing. We just run. Everybody is accepted. You want to run, we gonna have fun. Let\u2019s run.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Markelle Taylor finished the 2019 Boston Marathon in three hours, three minutes and 52 seconds, a blisteringly fast time for a 46-year-old man who did all of his training on a quarter-mile track of asphalt, gravel and dirt with six 90-degree turns. Weeks before, on 2 March 2019, Taylor was released on parole from San Quentin State Prison in California after serving 17 years and seven months after being found guilty of second-degree murder. Some prisons are trying to reduce recidivism by offering organized sports programs. These programs go beyond one or two hours of daily recreation by introducing volunteer coaches from outside the prisons, as well as rules to remain in the program. Through sports such as baseball, running and rugby, inmates are finding structure, learning social skills and building self-esteem. Taylor found his speed and inner strength while training with the San Quentin 1,000 Mile Running Club. At the end of 2017, 1,489,363 prisoners were in custody in state and federal prisons in the United States. Once these inmates are released from prison, they are likely to reoffend and find themselves back in custody. Eighty-three percent of state prisoners released in 2005 were arrested at least once during the nine years following their release, and 44% were arrested during their first year after release. High recidivism rates are not limited to the United States. Between 2016 and 2017, 48.3% of adults and 64.9% of juveniles released from custody reoffended within one year in England and Wales.

Kremer said, \u201cOn the baseball diamond, racial lines totally go away,\u201d and inmates can form friendships that would be unlikely elsewhere in prison where certain areas are allocated to specific races. Taylor never saw any racial animosity during his time with the 1,000 Mile Club, and Ruona agrees. \u201cWe\u2019ve got roughly 30% Caucasian, 30% black, 30% Hispanic, and then the other 10% are Asian, Arabic, and other races. They all get along well. They seem to support each other,\u201d said Ruona. Cleo Cloman requested a transfer to San Quentin after 15 years in prison because he heard it had a baseball team. He missed the sport his father introduced him to at the age of five and that he played through high school. Baseball helped Cloman find a sense of purpose again. \u201cBaseball is my passion,\u201d Cloman said. \u201cBaseball is a tool. Baseball is my love. Baseball is my understanding. Baseball is my peace. And I know I find that between the foul lines.\u201d After six years at San Quentin, Cloman was released on parole in May 2017 and has been working as a plumber for a year. He has stayed out of trouble and credits his experience playing baseball in prison as a key to his success. \u201cIn prison, our object was to go home, but in order to go home you had to know how to deal with reality at home,\u201d Cloman said. \u201cWe had to check ourselves and learn how to be different, and baseball taught me how to do that.\u201d Although there is limited empirical evidence of a direct causal relationship between prison sport participation and recidivism rates, Cloman\u2019s success during the last two years appears the norm for the San Quentin runners and baseball players. Kremer said none of the six or seven baseball players who have been released in the four years he has been involved with the baseball program have reoffended. Ruona has seen similar success during his 14 years with the 1,000 Mile Club. He knows of only one former runner who is back in prison (and happens to be running at San Quentin again). \u201cWe really did not have a lot of guys being released for the first seven or eight years that I was coaching the Club. Recently, the numbers have increased substantially,\u201d Ruona said. \u201cI know of at least 30 guys who have been released and are still out of prison as far as I know.\u201d Although it\u2019s only been a few months since his release, Taylor is thankful the running community outside of prison is as welcoming as the 1,000 Mile Club. \u201cThe running community is beautiful,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel no judgment, nothing. We just run. Everybody is accepted. You want to run, we gonna have fun. Let\u2019s run.\u201d",

You could almost hear the country asking the question as Boris Johnson doled out his big cabinet jobs. As home secretary, we now have Priti Patel, who broadcast her logic-free <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5aodBfdFTA\" title=\"\">support for the death penalty</a> on primetime TV. Our new foreign secretary is Dominic Raab, the intrepid soul who apparently only recently discovered the existence of Calais.

The new guard burn with an ideological purpose that runs way beyond Brexit. Two of the top three jobs in government are now held by authors of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\" title=\"\">Britannia Unchained</a>, the collection of radical-right essays published in 2012 that decried Britons as \u201camong the worst idlers in the world\u201d. Their prescription was basically Thatcherism with knuckle-dusters: slash taxes, burn red tape, strip workers of their rights in the name of competing with the Chinese. </p> <p>At No 11, you can expect Javid to turn those words into policy, with a hard-right Keynesian reflation of the economy. Taxes will be slashed, billions will be handed to big construction for public works and Labour\u2019s John McDonnell will find it quite tricky to point out the differences between his plans and the government\u2019s.</p> <p>The upshot of the new Johnson government is that a completely different wing has now taken control of the Tory party, far harder and more rightwing than we have seen before. A party with a tiny membership has just been subject to a hostile takeover. It is, in other words, exactly what Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of since 2015 \u2013 but never carried out with anything like the seriousness. We are at the beginning of a revolution in Conservatism \u2013 one led entirely from above.</p> <p>Is he serious? The bad news is: yes.</p> <p>\u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/sonia-sodha\" title=\"\">Sonia Sodha</a>: \u2018He\u2019s created a Vote Leave reunion cabinet\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4aa0a3d2d72c5e7d4b85be5efedfef1a65bcbfd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aa0a3d2d72c5e7d4b85be5efedfef1a65bcbfd0/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Sonia Sodha\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Thanks to a leadership contest that was heavy on bombastic rhetoric and light on detail, Johnson went to Buckingham Palace with huge questions hanging over his Brexit strategy. And in terms of clues of how it might develop, what he did in the first few hours of his premiership was always going to be more significant than what he said: there was no way he was going to backpedal from \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/25/brexit-boris-johnson-britain-will-leave-eu-31-october-do-or-die\" title=\"\">do or die</a>\u201d in his first speech as prime minister. That\u2019s why people have been so keenly watching out for his top cabinet appointments, and what they say about the type of government he\u2019s going to lead.</p> <p>And they leave no room for doubt. Johnson appears to have entirely jacked in the idea of unifying his party around a broad-church cabinet, resigned himself to the fact he\u2019s facing an autumn parliamentary showdown followed by a general election, and worked backwards from there. So he\u2019s created a Vote Leave reunion cabinet that will have few qualms about backing a no-deal Brexit if the EU, as expected, refuse Johnson\u2019s completely unreasonable demands to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement.</p> <p>In doing so, he\u2019s created all the makings of a very bumpy ride on the way to that showdown. He\u2019ll try to tell the moderates in his party that he\u2019s going to make a reasonable bash at reaching a new consensus with the EU. But take a look at the faces round his cabinet table \u2013 why would they believe him? Plus the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-49104765\" title=\"\">David Mundells</a> of this world join others like Philip Hammond and David Gauke on the backbenches \u2013 the people who would have carried on serving but who, having been sacked by Johnson, are free to make trouble alongside those who resigned out of principle.</p> <p>Johnson last night fired the opening Brexit salvo. But his working majority is tiny and expect parliament \u2013 sooner or later \u2013 to fight back. The odds of a general election in the next three months have only increased.</p> <p>\u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and deputy opinion editor at the Guardian</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/katy-balls\" title=\"\">Katy Balls</a>: \u2018Johnson has sent a horde of angry politicians to the backbenches\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"68baed83b7ebfc0afe9b6fc9b9af65cb2b972503\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68baed83b7ebfc0afe9b6fc9b9af65cb2b972503/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Katy Balls\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When Boris Johnson was asked his favourite film scene in a recent interview, <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2019/07/boris-takes-inspiration-from-the-godfather/\" title=\"\">he replied</a>: \u201cthe multiple retribution killings at the end of The Godfather\u201d \u2013 pointing to the mafia film\u2019s \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d scene where Michael Corleone exacts his revenge on rival dons. There certainly seemed to be at least a whiff of that sentiment in the prime minister\u2019s new government \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/boris-johnsons-cabinet-cull-the-departures-so-far\" title=\"\">17 cabinet ministers</a> exiting the stage.</p> <p>While some of the exits were expected, it was much more expansive than most Tory MPs had anticipated. This included Britain\u2019s first female defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt \u2013 forced out of the role after just a couple of months. The Johnson camp are thought to have been unhappy with her support for Jeremy Hunt in the leadership contest.</p> <p>Although loyalty was one factor in the decision-making process, it alone was not enough. One of the most brutal exits was that of James Brokenshire. The housing secretary was one of the first cabinet ministers to publicly endorse Boris Johnson. He was still given the chop.</p> <p>Such a drastic change of government is the type of thing one would usually expect from a prime minister with a large majority, fresh from a successful election. In truth, Johnson has a tiny majority and has just sent a horde of angry politicians to the backbenches. There\u2019s already talk of a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/24/philip-hammond-quits-johnson-fully-aligned-chancellor-gauke-stewart\" title=\"\">Gaukward squad</a>\u201d of no-deal sceptic former ministers who will work together to thwart Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans. This will likely now only increase in size.</p> <p>But last night\u2019s reshuffle wasn\u2019t about party unity. Johnson knows he has under 100 days to deliver Brexit \u2013 it follows that he has decided to try a different strategy to Theresa May\u2019s. Rather than spending a lot of time keeping a leave/remain balance in cabinet in a bid to not inflame internal party Brexit tensions, Johnson would rather ministers were all on the same page. A Johnson government will attempt to lead from the front and then challenge MPs to rebel if they dare. It\u2019s a risky strategy that means government defeats in the Commons could become a regular feature. However, with talk of an early election rampant, there\u2019s a view from Johnson allies that it\u2019s better to look as if you are a government trying to get things done, than one too scared of rebel MPs to bother.</p> <p>\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/paul-mason\" title=\"\">Paul Mason</a>: \u2018Johnson has designed this cabinet to win a snap election\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b16e737c25a8a527d7ed105dd97cd781c6c2ae19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b16e737c25a8a527d7ed105dd97cd781c6c2ae19/0_0_480_480/480.png\" alt=\"Paul Mason\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Through a peculiarity of the British system, an electorate that would not give Theresa May\u2019s team of technocrats a majority in parliament now has to watch powerless as Johnson\u2019s team, drawn from the truly venal end of British conservatism, takes power.

      "bodyText": "Aditya Chakrabortty: \u2018It\u2019s Thatcherism with knuckle-dusters: slash taxes, burn red tape, strip workers of their rights\u2019 Is he serious? You could almost hear the country asking the question as Boris Johnson doled out his big cabinet jobs. As home secretary, we now have Priti Patel, who broadcast her logic-free support for the death penalty on primetime TV. Our new foreign secretary is Dominic Raab, the intrepid soul who apparently only recently discovered the existence of Calais. In charge of the Treasury is Sajid Javid, the ex-investment banker who went off on a jolly to Australia while steelworkers at Port Talbot were facing the dole. In this government of none of the talents, these gaffe-prone, substance-free caricatures will have free rein. As trade secretary, Liz Truss will finally be able to introduce import substitution for British cheese. Priti will doubtless cover Dominic\u2019s job in her family holidays. Yet they\u2019re serious, all right. The new guard burn with an ideological purpose that runs way beyond Brexit. Two of the top three jobs in government are now held by authors of Britannia Unchained, the collection of radical-right essays published in 2012 that decried Britons as \u201camong the worst idlers in the world\u201d. Their prescription was basically Thatcherism with knuckle-dusters: slash taxes, burn red tape, strip workers of their rights in the name of competing with the Chinese. At No 11, you can expect Javid to turn those words into policy, with a hard-right Keynesian reflation of the economy. Taxes will be slashed, billions will be handed to big construction for public works and Labour\u2019s John McDonnell will find it quite tricky to point out the differences between his plans and the government\u2019s. The upshot of the new Johnson government is that a completely different wing has now taken control of the Tory party, far harder and more rightwing than we have seen before. A party with a tiny membership has just been subject to a hostile takeover. It is, in other words, exactly what Jeremy Corbyn has been accused of since 2015 \u2013 but never carried out with anything like the seriousness. We are at the beginning of a revolution in Conservatism \u2013 one led entirely from above. Is he serious? The bad news is: yes. \u2022 Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist Sonia Sodha: \u2018He\u2019s created a Vote Leave reunion cabinet\u2019 Thanks to a leadership contest that was heavy on bombastic rhetoric and light on detail, Johnson went to Buckingham Palace with huge questions hanging over his Brexit strategy. And in terms of clues of how it might develop, what he did in the first few hours of his premiership was always going to be more significant than what he said: there was no way he was going to backpedal from \u201cdo or die\u201d in his first speech as prime minister. That\u2019s why people have been so keenly watching out for his top cabinet appointments, and what they say about the type of government he\u2019s going to lead. And they leave no room for doubt. Johnson appears to have entirely jacked in the idea of unifying his party around a broad-church cabinet, resigned himself to the fact he\u2019s facing an autumn parliamentary showdown followed by a general election, and worked backwards from there. So he\u2019s created a Vote Leave reunion cabinet that will have few qualms about backing a no-deal Brexit if the EU, as expected, refuse Johnson\u2019s completely unreasonable demands to remove the backstop from the withdrawal agreement. In doing so, he\u2019s created all the makings of a very bumpy ride on the way to that showdown. He\u2019ll try to tell the moderates in his party that he\u2019s going to make a reasonable bash at reaching a new consensus with the EU. But take a look at the faces round his cabinet table \u2013 why would they believe him? Plus the David Mundells of this world join others like Philip Hammond and David Gauke on the backbenches \u2013 the people who would have carried on serving but who, having been sacked by Johnson, are free to make trouble alongside those who resigned out of principle. Johnson last night fired the opening Brexit salvo. But his working majority is tiny and expect parliament \u2013 sooner or later \u2013 to fight back. The odds of a general election in the next three months have only increased. \u2022 Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and deputy opinion editor at the Guardian Katy Balls: \u2018Johnson has sent a horde of angry politicians to the backbenches\u2019 When Boris Johnson was asked his favourite film scene in a recent interview, he replied: \u201cthe multiple retribution killings at the end of The Godfather\u201d \u2013 pointing to the mafia film\u2019s \u201cbaptism of fire\u201d scene where Michael Corleone exacts his revenge on rival dons. There certainly seemed to be at least a whiff of that sentiment in the prime minister\u2019s new government \u2013 with 17 cabinet ministers exiting the stage. While some of the exits were expected, it was much more expansive than most Tory MPs had anticipated. This included Britain\u2019s first female defence secretary, Penny Mordaunt \u2013 forced out of the role after just a couple of months. The Johnson camp are thought to have been unhappy with her support for Jeremy Hunt in the leadership contest. Although loyalty was one factor in the decision-making process, it alone was not enough. One of the most brutal exits was that of James Brokenshire. The housing secretary was one of the first cabinet ministers to publicly endorse Boris Johnson. He was still given the chop. Such a drastic change of government is the type of thing one would usually expect from a prime minister with a large majority, fresh from a successful election. In truth, Johnson has a tiny majority and has just sent a horde of angry politicians to the backbenches. There\u2019s already talk of a \u201cGaukward squad\u201d of no-deal sceptic former ministers who will work together to thwart Johnson\u2019s Brexit plans. This will likely now only increase in size. But last night\u2019s reshuffle wasn\u2019t about party unity. Johnson knows he has under 100 days to deliver Brexit \u2013 it follows that he has decided to try a different strategy to Theresa May\u2019s. Rather than spending a lot of time keeping a leave/remain balance in cabinet in a bid to not inflame internal party Brexit tensions, Johnson would rather ministers were all on the same page. A Johnson government will attempt to lead from the front and then challenge MPs to rebel if they dare. It\u2019s a risky strategy that means government defeats in the Commons could become a regular feature. However, with talk of an early election rampant, there\u2019s a view from Johnson allies that it\u2019s better to look as if you are a government trying to get things done, than one too scared of rebel MPs to bother. \u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor Paul Mason: \u2018Johnson has designed this cabinet to win a snap election\u2019 Through a peculiarity of the British system, an electorate that would not give Theresa May\u2019s team of technocrats a majority in parliament now has to watch powerless as Johnson\u2019s team, drawn from the truly venal end of British conservatism, takes power. There is Johnson himself, who awarded an unbuildable garden bridge contract to his acquaintances. Priti Patel, who once gave her diplomatic minders the slip while playing lady bountiful to Israel. Dominic Raab, who as foreign secretary gets to sit in a seat once occupied by men like Salisbury and Halifax, did not know Calais was an important trading port until last year. Gavin Williamson, dismissed for a security leak while defence secretary, will get to define what\u2019s right and wrong in the curriculum imposed by diktat on five-year-olds. The whole team now has a single task: to destroy four decades of engagement with Europe and the UK economy with it. This cabinet has been coming our way ever since Thatcherism, but it took a long time. The obstacles were always the Burkean tradition \u2013 which prized practicality over fanaticism \u2013 and the need to keep the liberal middle class on board. Now these constraints no longer apply. Boris Johnson has designed this cabinet to win a snap election with the votes of economically disadvantaged white voters with xenophobic tendencies dazzled by buffoonery and audacity. Most UK voters have scant knowledge of the British constitution but they have a sense of our implicit national assumptions about decency, honour and propriety: a tradition, as Noel Coward once put it, that has \u201cnine times out of 10 behaved decently and treated people right\u201d. It is that tradition of decency, rather than party political tribalism, that will quickly drive large numbers of people to resist this government of chancers and cronies. In this context, the heroic protest by Greenpeace activists, who forced Johnson\u2019s cavalcade to dip and swerve its way along the Mall, was a harbinger of something bigger. This is a cabinet handpicked to be driven from office amid protest and scandal. \u2022 Paul Mason is a writer and broadcaster on economics and social justice Martha Gill: \u2018A cabinet designed to be frustrated in its purpose\u2019 What is Johnson\u2019s cabinet designed to do? The old gang from his leave campaign are all there, but it\u2019s not about loyalty: those who have spent recent weeks slithering across hot coals for Johnson \u2013 James Brokenshire, Matt Hancock \u2013 have not been rewarded with the jobs or promotions they wanted.

      "body": "<p>As parts of Britain swelter in near-record temperatures, we answer some of the burning questions you may have.</p> <h2><strong>How big a factor is global heating?</strong></h2> <p>Extreme weather events have become more frequent in recent years as a result of global heating. Last week, scientists said July was on track to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/16/july-on-course-to-be-hottest-month-ever-say-climate-scientists\">the hottest month ever measured on Earth</a>, while last month <a href=\"https://climate.copernicus.eu/surface-air-temperature-june-2019\">was the warmest June ever recorded</a>. Early projections suggest 2019 is likely to be the second warmest year ever recorded, after only 2016, which was boosted by El Ni\u00f1o weather system.</p> <p>Nine of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p> <p>Although it is too early to pinpoint the extent to which the current UK heatwave was caused by global heating, scientists found the June heatwave across Europe was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/02/climate-change-european-heatwave-likelier\">made at least five times likelier</a> by the climate crisis, while last year\u2019s summer heatwave in the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/06/climate-change-made-uk-heatwave-30-times-more-likely-met-office\">was made at least 30 times more likely</a>.</p> <p>Prof Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Penn State University, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jul/27/extreme-global-weather-climate-change-michael-mann\">said last year</a> that asking if climate change \u201ccauses\u201d specific events was the wrong question. \u201cThe relevant question is: \u2018Is climate change impacting these events and making them more extreme?\u2019 And we can say with great confidence that it is.\u201d</p> <p>The impacts of climate breakdown are not limited to extreme heat \u2013 it is also making the weather more unpredictable and more extreme. The warming of the atmosphere results in more water evaporating from the oceans, meaning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/14/climate-change-hurricanes-study-global-warming\">hurricanes are growing more intense</a>, and prolonged periods of rainfall and floods are becoming more common.</p> <p>Although it is not yet conclusive, many scientists also believe climate breakdown is weakening the jet stream, which could be partly to blame for extended periods of extreme cold, such as last year\u2019s polar vortex in the US or the 2018 \u201cBeast from the East\u201d that brought heavy snow to the UK in March 2018. <strong>AE</strong></p> <h2><strong>How do you stay cool?</strong></h2> <p>Experts recommend staying in as well-ventilated environments as possible, while avoiding alcohol and exercise and drinking plenty of water.</p> <p>\u201cIf outside, wear loose, thin, porous, light-coloured long-sleeved clothing,\u201d said Prof Hugh Montgomery, from UCL\u2019s division of medicine. \u201cThis allows air movement, limits insulation, allows sweat to evaporate and reflects light and heat.\u201d</p> <p>Wearing a light, open fabric sun-hat can also help, he added. Outside, something as simple as consciously breathing can also help regulate the nervous system and cool you down.</p> <p>While inside, the NHS suggests keeping windows closed and using light-coloured curtains. \u201cYou can open the windows for ventilation when it is cooler,\u201d the health service advised.</p> <p>Prof Mike Tipton, from the University of Portsmouth\u2019s extreme environments laboratory, said that immersing your hands and feet in cool water was an effective way to lose heat.</p> <p>\u201cArtificially cool with fans. You can also enhance evaporation cooling by misting the body with water,\u201d he said, alluding to the increasingly popular hydrating products which you spray in your face.</p> <p>He also recommended checking your urine colour was a pale straw colour, which indicates adequate hydration.</p> <p>When preparing for bed, others recommended briefly putting your bed sheets and pillows into a plastic bag and placing them in a freezer, as well as freezing cold water in a hot water bottle to cuddle.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a very useful way of trying to keep your bed a little bit cooler for longer, or at least enough time for you to drift off to sleep,\u201d Dr Guy Leschziner, a neurologist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>In contrast to some commonly held beliefs, he also advocated wearing clothes to bed.</p> <p>\u201cPeople may be better off sleeping in clothing rather than sleeping naked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a natural fabric like cotton, then it acts as a wick for your sweat and acts as a surface area for it to evaporate, and thus may make you much cooler.\u201d <strong>MB</strong></p> <h2><strong>How is the economy affected?</strong></h2> <p>The heatwave is providing some respite for the high street as demand rockets for sundresses, electric fans and sprinklers. But experts have warned the burst of sunshine has arrived too late to save summer for some struggling chains.</p> <p>John Lewis said it was selling six fans a minute, with handheld ones particularly sought after as Britons tried to keep cool on the go. Sales of hoses and sprinklers were up nearly 60% on last week with demand for paddling pools surging more than 40%, the department store said.</p> <p>But after last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/sep/03/summer-2018-uk-joint-hottest-on-record-met-office-says\">long hot summer</a> many retailers are struggling to match stellar sales figures achieved in 2018. On Tuesday, the grocery market analysts Kantar said UK supermarkets sales had fallen for the first time in three years in the 12 weeks to 14 July as the cool start to the season hit sales of soft drinks, alcohol and ice-cream.</p> <p>Analysts suggested the hot spell would help retailers clear unsold seasonal products such as paddling pools and barbecues but had arrived too late for fashion retailers who were already holding sales, meaning any pick up in trade was less lucrative than it would have been earlier on.</p> <p>\u201cA heatwave affects different parts of the retail market in different ways,\u201d explained the independent retail analyst Richard Hyman, who cautioned very hot weather would deter people from visiting the high street. \u201cFood sales will go up because it is one of those areas that is most sensitive to spikes in the weather \u2026 but the summer [fashion] sales are nearer to their end than beginning.\u201d</p> <p>While the sunshine may provide a shot in the arm for some businesses, scientific studies have shown that high temperatures can knock the wider economy as productivity \u2013 the amount of economic output generated per hour worked \u2013 falters. Academics believe higher temperatures in hot countries can lower economic growth, but boost output in cold countries, with shifts of about 3-4% of GDP per degree celsius in both directions.</p> <p>When temperatures rise, crop yields fall. People take more time off, which leads to lower output, while concentration levels drop and mistakes are more likely. According to researchers at the University of Helsinki, the optimum temperature for office productivity is between 22C and 25C. Hotter than this and productivity falls, by as much as 5% at 28C. <strong>ZW</strong></p> <h2><strong>Is it hot everywhere?</strong></h2> <p>While the south of England swelters, temperatures in Scotland have not soared to such extremes, with Glasgow and Edinburgh in the central belt, as well as Aberdeen and Inverness further north, registering between 20C and 23C after a humid and stormy night.</p> <p>Lightning strikes overnight disrupted rail services in the Highlands, with passengers delayed because of damage to the signalling system between Inverness and Beauly.</p> <p>Occupants of a house struck by lightning in the village of Markinch, in Fife, escaped injury after a roof fire was sparked by thunderstorms, which intensified after 4am.</p> <p>The Met Office warned that storms would continue to affect Scotland throughout Wednesday. The east coast of Scotland is expected to see more sunshine, with cloud clearing for a bright afternoon. <strong>LB</strong></p>",

Prof Michael Mann, a prominent climate scientist at Penn State University, said last year that asking if climate change \u201ccauses\u201d specific events was the wrong question. \u201cThe relevant question is: \u2018Is climate change impacting these events and making them more extreme?\u2019 And we can say with great confidence that it is.\u201d The impacts of climate breakdown are not limited to extreme heat \u2013 it is also making the weather more unpredictable and more extreme. The warming of the atmosphere results in more water evaporating from the oceans, meaning hurricanes are growing more intense, and prolonged periods of rainfall and floods are becoming more common. Although it is not yet conclusive, many scientists also believe climate breakdown is weakening the jet stream, which could be partly to blame for extended periods of extreme cold, such as last year\u2019s polar vortex in the US or the 2018 \u201cBeast from the East\u201d that brought heavy snow to the UK in March 2018. AE How do you stay cool? Experts recommend staying in as well-ventilated environments as possible, while avoiding alcohol and exercise and drinking plenty of water. \u201cIf outside, wear loose, thin, porous, light-coloured long-sleeved clothing,\u201d said Prof Hugh Montgomery, from UCL\u2019s division of medicine. \u201cThis allows air movement, limits insulation, allows sweat to evaporate and reflects light and heat.\u201d Wearing a light, open fabric sun-hat can also help, he added. Outside, something as simple as consciously breathing can also help regulate the nervous system and cool you down. While inside, the NHS suggests keeping windows closed and using light-coloured curtains. \u201cYou can open the windows for ventilation when it is cooler,\u201d the health service advised. Prof Mike Tipton, from the University of Portsmouth\u2019s extreme environments laboratory, said that immersing your hands and feet in cool water was an effective way to lose heat. \u201cArtificially cool with fans. You can also enhance evaporation cooling by misting the body with water,\u201d he said, alluding to the increasingly popular hydrating products which you spray in your face. He also recommended checking your urine colour was a pale straw colour, which indicates adequate hydration. When preparing for bed, others recommended briefly putting your bed sheets and pillows into a plastic bag and placing them in a freezer, as well as freezing cold water in a hot water bottle to cuddle. \u201cThat\u2019s a very useful way of trying to keep your bed a little bit cooler for longer, or at least enough time for you to drift off to sleep,\u201d Dr Guy Leschziner, a neurologist at Guy\u2019s and St Thomas\u2019 hospitals, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. In contrast to some commonly held beliefs, he also advocated wearing clothes to bed. \u201cPeople may be better off sleeping in clothing rather than sleeping naked,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re wearing a natural fabric like cotton, then it acts as a wick for your sweat and acts as a surface area for it to evaporate, and thus may make you much cooler.\u201d MB How is the economy affected? The heatwave is providing some respite for the high street as demand rockets for sundresses, electric fans and sprinklers. But experts have warned the burst of sunshine has arrived too late to save summer for some struggling chains. John Lewis said it was selling six fans a minute, with handheld ones particularly sought after as Britons tried to keep cool on the go. Sales of hoses and sprinklers were up nearly 60% on last week with demand for paddling pools surging more than 40%, the department store said. But after last year\u2019s long hot summer many retailers are struggling to match stellar sales figures achieved in 2018. On Tuesday, the grocery market analysts Kantar said UK supermarkets sales had fallen for the first time in three years in the 12 weeks to 14 July as the cool start to the season hit sales of soft drinks, alcohol and ice-cream. Analysts suggested the hot spell would help retailers clear unsold seasonal products such as paddling pools and barbecues but had arrived too late for fashion retailers who were already holding sales, meaning any pick up in trade was less lucrative than it would have been earlier on. \u201cA heatwave affects different parts of the retail market in different ways,\u201d explained the independent retail analyst Richard Hyman, who cautioned very hot weather would deter people from visiting the high street. \u201cFood sales will go up because it is one of those areas that is most sensitive to spikes in the weather \u2026 but the summer [fashion] sales are nearer to their end than beginning.\u201d While the sunshine may provide a shot in the arm for some businesses, scientific studies have shown that high temperatures can knock the wider economy as productivity \u2013 the amount of economic output generated per hour worked \u2013 falters. Academics believe higher temperatures in hot countries can lower economic growth, but boost output in cold countries, with shifts of about 3-4% of GDP per degree celsius in both directions. When temperatures rise, crop yields fall. People take more time off, which leads to lower output, while concentration levels drop and mistakes are more likely. According to researchers at the University of Helsinki, the optimum temperature for office productivity is between 22C and 25C. Hotter than this and productivity falls, by as much as 5% at 28C. ZW Is it hot everywhere? While the south of England swelters, temperatures in Scotland have not soared to such extremes, with Glasgow and Edinburgh in the central belt, as well as Aberdeen and Inverness further north, registering between 20C and 23C after a humid and stormy night. Lightning strikes overnight disrupted rail services in the Highlands, with passengers delayed because of damage to the signalling system between Inverness and Beauly. Occupants of a house struck by lightning in the village of Markinch, in Fife, escaped injury after a roof fire was sparked by thunderstorms, which intensified after 4am. The Met Office warned that storms would continue to affect Scotland throughout Wednesday. The east coast of Scotland is expected to see more sunshine, with cloud clearing for a bright afternoon. LB",

But this story, and others like it, is the background sitting behind the effort by the crossbench in the last federal parliament to overhaul the previous medical evacuation procedures for the asylum seekers and failed asylum seekers languishing offshore; stories of illness, despair and desperation. This is a horror of Australia\u2019s creation, part of a deliberate effort to deter would-be asylum seekers from coming here by boat. We can\u2019t see it, because it is playing out daily in remote places far from Australia, but we are responsible \u2013 all of us \u2013 for the consequences of the harsh deterrence regime that has been established in our name. The day before Dreyfus told his story in the House, Guardian Australia published new statistics about the scale of mental health problems on Nauru and Manus Island. The information surfaced because of the reporting requirements of the medevac regime the Morrison government is currently trying to repeal. The independent health advice panel now overseeing medical transfers for asylum seekers languishing offshore reported there were 73 admissions covering 43 people at the RPC Medical Centre on Nauru in the first quarter of 2019. In addition to the 73 admissions, with stays ranging between one and 44 days, there were also 8,260 medical consultations provided to people on Nauru in the quarter \u2013 mostly for mental health problems. I\u2019ll repeat that. Mostly for mental health problems. The first quarterly report of the independent panel did not have the input of a psychiatrist. The president of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists, John Allan, on Thursday urged the parliament to maintain the medevac regime. \u201cGiven the high number of presentations and admissions of asylum seekers and refugees for mental health reasons, we believe the panel is an imperative safeguard for the government, the people being held offshore, and the medical specialists and other health practitioners providing care offshore,\u201d Allan said. According to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre, the medevac regime has, as of 3pm Wednesday, seen 96 people approved for transfer for treatment since it was legislated, with 88 of those recommended transfers also approved by the minister. The independent health panel has been involved in reviewing cases on 21 occasions. On eight occasions, the process was contested, and the panel overturned the minister\u2019s decision to decline transfers on medical grounds. On the other 13 occasions, the panel upheld the minister\u2019s view that the appropriate medical threshold had not been reached to necessitate a transfer. No credible evidence has been presented to date that I am aware of that demonstrates this system isn\u2019t working \u2013 evidence that would justify scrapping procedures that allow clinicians scope to safeguard physical and mental wellbeing. But despite this, the House of Representatives passed a bill repealing the medevac procedures on Thursday. The Coalition has dug in, apparently determined to secure the repeal, and whether the government succeeds in its objective later this year will ultimately come down to one vote.

      "body": "<p>A true Cats fan always sits in the aisle during performances. A true Cats fan knows that the show is one of musical theatre\u2019s grandest creations, as history will tell. A true Cats fan holds no truck with the haters who say that the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical makes no sense \u2013 because they know there is something that is probably quite ineffable, and more than a little bit magical, about the show.</p> <p>A true Cats fan won\u2019t settle for seeing the show once, twice or even 10 times. Just ask Hector Montalvo, 62, a retired product demonstrator from New York. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t call myself a legend,\u201d he says. \u201cJust a patron who loves the show.\u201d But before Cats ended its first Broadway run in 2000, Montalvo had seen 703 performances.</p> <p>Montalvo has the ticket stub from his first performance, on 11 October 1982, which he keeps at home in a clear display case that he calls the Jellicle Box. It contains other treasured artefacts, including crystal beads that once flew off a costume mid-show, two copies of the book on which Cats is based, TS Eliot\u2019s Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats, signed by every cast member, and a piece of the Winter Garden Theater stage floor. Montalvo was at the invite-only final Broadway performance, and attended the farewell party. \u201cWhen it was all over, and I saw from the cab the theatre was totally dark, I felt as if a part of my life had died.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e2b3fc9b9d18cc6f3820d4c191597054795f2af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e2b3fc9b9d18cc6f3820d4c191597054795f2af/161_0_4377_3040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elaine Paige in the show\u2019s original West End run.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"695\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elaine Paige in the show\u2019s original West End run.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Montalvo is still digesting the events of last week, when the trailer for the forthcoming film adaptation of Cats was released, and the internet hawked up a collective hairball in response. Starring Idris Elba, Jennifer Hudson and notorious cat-botherer Taylor Swift, and directed by Tom Hooper \u2013 who brought Les Miserables to the big screen \u2013 the trailer featured an array of CGI-generated, anthropomorphised cats ranging from \u201csomewhat alarming\u201d to \u201cfull Chucky\u201d in appearance. Hardcore fans reacted negatively to odd costume changes, such as the fact that Old Deuteronomy, played by Judi Dench, wore a cat-fur coat. And more to the point: what was with the confusingly located tails?</p> <p>Even if you\u2019re not a fan of the stage show, the Cats trailer makes for discombobulating viewing. But, 38 years after it first hit the West End, Cats retains a claw-like grip on popular culture. The story of a tribe of cats called the Jellicles who gather to decide which cat will go to heaven and come back with a new life \u2013 the so-called \u201cJellicle choice\u201d \u2013 Cats is one of the most successful musicals of all time. Its original West End production ran for 21 years and 8,949 performances, while the Broadway adaptation was on stage for 18 years. It made stars out of cast members such as Elaine Paige and Betty Buckley, and the musical\u2019s most famous song, Memory, is still belted out in karaoke bars around the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15822827efa8848cebe770d9afbea8c55cfa7dcb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15822827efa8848cebe770d9afbea8c55cfa7dcb/0_0_4168_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An actor gets ready for a show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An actor gets ready for a show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ton Koene/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cats fans are the most engaged of any in musical-theatre history. But why do they keep returning to the Jellicle Ball, all these years on? \u201cTo escape,\u201d says the Australian film-maker Mark Dooley. His documentary Repeat Attenders tells the story of the musical-theatre superfans who see the same shows over and over again. \u201cFor two-and-a-half hours, you\u2019re in another world, and nothing else \u2013 not what\u2019s happening in your real life \u2013 matters. You can be surrounded, and entertained, and feel joyful, for that time.\u201d</p> <p>There are no laboured political messages in Cats, only the horny pleasures of watching the Rum Tum Tugger hip-thrust his way through increasingly surreal dance routines. \u201cThe dancing, the costumes, the music, the concept, the story \u2013 it\u2019s so engaging,\u201d gushes 37-year-old mathematician Will Gosnell, from Amherst, Massachusetts. He saw Cats 23 times on Broadway. \u201cIt pulls you in, and you get hypnotised by the whole show.\u201d Such is his love for Cats, Gosnell has written three cat-related songs, which he has uploaded to his YouTube channel. What\u2019s the Cat Gonna Do?, Mister Man the Kitty Wears Pink Sweaters, and Horton the Extraordinary Cat are all inspired by Gosnell\u2019s affinity for the feline species, as well as the oeuvre of Lloyd Webber.</p> <p>Part of the show\u2019s appeal is that there are so many characters for audiences to relate to. Montalvo was bullied at school. Like the outcast Grizabella, he knows \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to be ostracised\u201d. \u201cIt hurts to see Grizabella being unaccepted through most of the show,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause you could say: \u2018I walked a mile in her paws.\u2019\u201d Carlo Castronovo, from Devens, Massachusetts, has seen Cats 80 times. The 44-year-old aviation inspector feels most like Skimbleshanks. Like him, he\u2019s \u201calways on the go, always double-checking everything, making sure nothing\u2019s going wrong, and if something\u2019s going wrong, always trying to handle it to the best of my ability\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c29649251ae6a57aa13797f41580ba1758bead89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c29649251ae6a57aa13797f41580ba1758bead89/0_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cats on stage ... the show in Singapore.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cats on stage ... the show in Singapore.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suhaimi Abdullah/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Cats\u2019 elaborate costumes also help. \u201cIt gives the fans an opportunity to feel like they\u2019re part of the show, by getting little groups of friends together and knitting leg warmers and swapping wigs and going to fan conventions,\u201d Dooley says. Castronovo has Munkustrap, Skimbleshanks and Gus costumes, which he wears to performances. Once, he dressed as Munkustrap during the matinee performance of the 2012 revival at the Gateway Playhouse in Long Island. \u201cI had a front-row seat, and at the end of the show I\u2019m literally nose-to-nose with the real Munkustrap,\u201d he rhapsodises. \u201cHe gives me this look like: \u2018Get lost \u2013 you\u2019re not one of us. We don\u2019t want you here.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another reason Cats inspires such loyalty is that it was the original blockbuster mega-musical. \u201cIt\u2019s the gateway show for musical-theatre fans,\u201d Dooley explains, telling me that the typical Cats superfan is aged 40-plus and remembers the original West End and Broadway shows. Cats was also one of the first shows to be available on VHS, creating a fanbase among those unable to catch the stage show. Millicent Thomas, 21, a student from Manchester, first saw the 1998 Cats movie when she was four. \u201cIt\u2019s stunning,\u201d she says. \u201cThe actors look into the camera like you\u2019re an audience member, and they\u2019re looking at you.\u201d She watched Cats thrice weekly throughout her childhood, and credits it with turning her into \u201cthat musical-theatre kid\u201d.</p> <p>But although Cats is now a roaring tigress, the show was once an undercat. In the early 80s, Lloyd Webber hadn\u2019t yet built his reputation as an impresario, and the 1982 Broadway opening had mixed reviews. \u201cIt started out with nothing promising about it \u2013 people dressed up in cat costumes seemed ludicrous,\u201d says the musical-theatre expert Prof Alyson McLamore of California Polytechnic State University. Critics were scathing about the show\u2019s gossamer-thin plot, but McLamore explains that Cats is indebted to the theatrical tradition of a revue, rather than being driven by narrative in the manner of most modern-day musicals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"03b38102ee9ff773d3e7acec4570290e9ae30787\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/03b38102ee9ff773d3e7acec4570290e9ae30787/524_0_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria (Francesca Hayward) in the movie adaptation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria (Francesca Hayward) in the movie adaptation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal Pictures</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The fact that Cats is heavily grounded in dance also explains why some critics were uncertain about the show. \u201cMusical-theatre scholars tend to be dismissive of dance,\u201d McLamore says. But it was the sheer athleticism of Cats that drew Thomas in. \u201cWhat they do with their bodies is unbelievable. You forget they\u2019re human sometimes. They really inhabit the feline aspect of it.\u201d As a child, she would rewatch the number where Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer do an interlocking cartwheel, over and over again.</p> <p>The stage show also stands out because of its strong element of audience participation. \u201cYou\u2019re really enmeshed in it,\u201d McLamore says. \u201cYou\u2019re not sitting 100ft away \u2013 you\u2019re really involved in the action and the scale of things.\u201d The film critic Hannah Woodhead, 26, saw the Cats film at least 40 times before she caught the touring version as a child at the Sheffield Lyceum. Sitting in the aisle was as clever a decision as Mr Mistoffelees himself would have made. \u201cThe cats run through the audience and purr and nuzzle your leg. For me, as a child it was like: is theatre always like this? My mind was absolutely blown.\u201d</p> <p>After seeing a show so many times, you become an honorary cast member. \u201cIt reached the point where cast members knew about and had ways of acknowledging my presence, while staying in character,\u201d Montalvo reminisces. Some would do friendly hisses in his direction, or rub up against him seductively. \u201cThere was even a running gag going with Griddlebone [played by Nina Hennessey] in which she would swat me with her tail. That tail should be considered a weapon!\u201d</p> <p>When your fanbase is this devoted, changes can make fur fly. After Lloyd Webber attempted to modernise the Rum Tum Tugger by turning him into a rapper for Cats\u2019 2014 West End revival, Castronovo was appalled. He set up a Facebook page called Preserve the Magic of Cats, and found an email address for Lloyd Webber. \u201cI sent him a very friendly email, you know what I mean? Very friendly. Saying: \u2018Tugger is supposed to be played this way. You\u2019re going in the opposite direction. I\u2019ve talked to many a fan, and no one really likes this.\u2019\u201d Lloyd Webber never replied, but the rapping was ditched for the show\u2019s 2016 Broadway revival, so Castronovo is claiming it as a victory.</p> <p>With the film of Cats due out in December, many of the superfans I spoke with had some specific costuming grievances. Woodhead was upset that the trailer suggests Skimbleshanks has lost his pocket watch. \u201cThe costume design of the show is so iconic. You become attached to these characters when you\u2019re a kid, so when you see that kind of change, you think: \u2018I can\u2019t believe this.\u2019\u201d Thomas gripes that Macavity (played by Idris Elba) is wearing a hat, which he does not in the stage show. But she is relaxed about the fact that the female cats are mostly naked, while the male cats wear clothes: \u201cIt\u2019s strange, but that\u2019s how it is in the show.\u201d What about the fact that Bombalurina has breasts? \u201cI think it would have been weirder if she didn\u2019t have boobs. She\u2019s meant to be the sexy cat, all the boys are after her \u2013 it feels right that she\u2019s got that look about her.\u201d</p> <p>What about the confusion over whether the cats are human-sized? \u201cTo start putting the cats in bedrooms and streets and bars is really brave,\u201d Thomas says, explaining that issues of scale aren\u2019t a factor in the stage show, as the cats don\u2019t leave the junkyard set. \u201cI think they are supposed to be cat-sized cats, because in the last show of the trailer, where they\u2019re in the square, you can see their proportions.\u201d</p> <p>As for Castronovo, he\u2019s trying to keep an open mind, but he\u2019s anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly. I\u2019ll say the costumes right now can look a little creepy maybe for the younger kids. It may be a little too creepy.\u201d But Thomas think that criticism of the Cats trailer for being too freaky misses the point. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole idea of Cats! It\u2019s supposed to look like you\u2019re stepping into this Alice-in-Wonderland bizarre, surreal world where nothing feels right.\u201d</p>",

But she is relaxed about the fact that the female cats are mostly naked, while the male cats wear clothes: \u201cIt\u2019s strange, but that\u2019s how it is in the show.\u201d What about the fact that Bombalurina has breasts? \u201cI think it would have been weirder if she didn\u2019t have boobs. She\u2019s meant to be the sexy cat, all the boys are after her \u2013 it feels right that she\u2019s got that look about her.\u201d What about the confusion over whether the cats are human-sized? \u201cTo start putting the cats in bedrooms and streets and bars is really brave,\u201d Thomas says, explaining that issues of scale aren\u2019t a factor in the stage show, as the cats don\u2019t leave the junkyard set. \u201cI think they are supposed to be cat-sized cats, because in the last show of the trailer, where they\u2019re in the square, you can see their proportions.\u201d As for Castronovo, he\u2019s trying to keep an open mind, but he\u2019s anxious. \u201cI don\u2019t know, honestly. I\u2019ll say the costumes right now can look a little creepy maybe for the younger kids. It may be a little too creepy.\u201d But Thomas think that criticism of the Cats trailer for being too freaky misses the point. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole idea of Cats! It\u2019s supposed to look like you\u2019re stepping into this Alice-in-Wonderland bizarre, surreal world where nothing feels right.\u201d",

I think that\u2019s not one of the matters that was changed. But the bill did go through a range of amendments based on committee recommendations and those amendments were to bring the bill as closely into line with corporations law as could possibly be achieved with respect to registered organisations.\u201d<br></p> <p>That answer is wrong \u2013 because the amnesty was removed from the <em>Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Superannuation Measures No. 1) bill 2019</em> - and is also confused, because the second half appears to relate to the <em>Ensuring Integrity bill, </em>which never contained the amnesty.</p> <p>But in any event, despite the confusion it seems clear the amnesty for employers who don\u2019t pay super IS still policy.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T06:22:44.183Z\">at 7.22am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d39483c8f08cf92bb776916\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T06:13:25.780Z\">7.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> asks whether unauthorised strike action could see unions in trouble under the ensuring integrity bill.</p> <p><strong>Christian Porter </strong>tells Afternoon Briefing:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, the structure of the bill as it sets out quite clearly, what are the types of behaviour, unlawful behaviour which could trigger an application issuer against a sitting public official or where there\u2019s lots of that behaviour occurring against registered organisation itself. </p> <p>But of course the point I think is that these are triggers which then require an argument by someone with sufficient standing before the federal court. </p> <p>As to why the pattern of unlawful behaviour warrants an organisation or part of an organisation, say a branch being deregistered, and then the court would have to consider whether that was just in all the circumstances. So there are all of the usual safeguards and steps and requirements and burdens and things that must be shown and proven.

And on this side of the House, on this side of the House, before we came into the House, many of us were involved in farming and business.</p> <p> That\u2019s what many of us did. And the result of that is we have interests in family farms and that is fully declared through my family company, Mr Speaker. As has been widely reported in the media. </p> <p>Now, Mr Speaker, the reason this issue came up is several years ago, before I was in this current role, several years ago, I sought to ensure that my farmers were being fairly treated in the electorate of Hume under a revised EPBC listing. And that revised EPBC listing was having an impact on, and creating concerns, with my farmers, which were raised \u2013 which were raised, Mr Speaker, which were raised by the New South Wales famers and in National Farmers Federation on several occasions, Mr Speaker. </p> <p>And I read from the letter to the treasurer at that time.</p> <p> I quote: \u201cAt the time the listing was raised the NFF raised this, the then minister of environment and energy the now treasurer, the information available for public consultation did not provide any qualified assessment of the extent, distribution and the quality of the listing\u201d. </p> <p>The information provided is part of the review did not adequately analyse the ongoing risks, and thirdly, Mr Speaker, based on the information provided in the NFF\u2019s view it is highly unlikely an individual farmer would be able to assess their responsibilities under the EPBC. </p> <p>These were legitimate concerns, they were properly raised in the right context, Mr Speaker, because I stand up for my farmers. </p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T04:44:05.042Z\">at 5.44am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3931e68f0845f89e313e44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T04:37:02.030Z\">5.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Josh Frydenberg </strong>has the next dixer and is demonstrating how to make three minutes feel like 10.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d3930538f0845f89e313e3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-25T04:33:57.514Z\">5.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Butler </strong>to<strong> Angus Taylor:</strong></p> <p>Butler jumped up, but Gladys Liu tried to beat him.

It is important to improve our landscapes. $1.1bn has gone into land care itself. </p> <p>A great movement has changed the practices of our farmers for the better, not only for environmental outcomes but profitability. Only last night, this government was able to pass the Future Drought Fund. $100m dividend, year in, year out. It is legislated. We will be going out and consulting with the community. What a crazy idea the government might go out and ask those whose money it is how it might be spent. We will talk about climate risk and make sure farmers take up the research and development we\u2019ve got to adapt to a changing climate.

Super is now almost twice the size of the economy and the capitalisation of the securities exchange. We have the fourth-largest private pension pool in the world with only 25 million people. </p> <p>It remains a strange but huge experiment. The Centre for Independent Studies says one of the preconditions necessary to justify forced saving is that \u201cunder-saving for retirement will result in serious harm, including serious levels of old age poverty\u201d. </p> <p><strong>Super fails at the first gate as the age pension underwrites Australians against old age poverty.</strong> Grattan Institute modelling shows super tax breaks will not pay for reduced pension outlays until the 22nd century, if at all!</p> <p> So what does this money do? Most of the funds invest in the same index-hugging way. The super industry contains layer upon layer of intermediation, with the same request from government: higher and higher mandatory contributions. </p> <p>As lawmakers, our duty is to focus on the public interest. I do not believe this system is working for Australians. Certainly the case has not been made for ever bigger super. I would change direction.<strong> Super should be made voluntary for Australians earning under $50,000. </strong>Taxpayers could simply tick a box to get a refund when filing an annual tax return. I commissioned modelling from Rice Warner actuaries, which estimates a saving to government of $1.8bn in the first year alone.</p> <p><strong> Super is making home ownership so much harder for lower income Australians.</strong></p> <p> The CIS found that the average deposit for a first home has doubled between 2000 and 2015. Since super started in 1992, every single age group has experienced lower levels of home ownership. </p> <p>Two answers must be provided, in my view, if we are to keep super as it is today: (1) will more super reduce future pension costs to government \u2013 and if so, by how much \u2013 and (2) how much better would retirement standards be if we had more super? The last Intergenerational Report showed around 80% of people would take a public pension in 2055. That is not good enough after 70 years of compulsory superannuation.<strong> Unless the next edition favourably answers these questions, I would be inclined to make the whole scheme voluntary</strong>.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-24T22:32:37.312Z\">at 11.32pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d38d42e8f0845f89e313c5f\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-24T22:20:13.477Z\">11.20pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s parliament Friday, which means the MPs are itching to get out and back home.</p> <p>But first there is the business of legislating.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s how Mike Bowers saw some of the day Kristina Keneally has seemingly beat the government in the temporary exclusion order press release race (where she explains why Labor supported a bill it has a concerns about, because this is becoming something of a habit): Australia will finally have a mechanism to appropriately control the return of foreign fighters into the country following the passage of the Temporary Exclusion Order (TEO) legislation through the parliament this afternoon. This is not a victory for Peter Dutton who, as home affairs minister, could have had this legislation in place four years ago \u2013 just as the United Kingdom did in 2015. Instead, Minister Dutton left Australia unprotected for four years, allowing, as we learned this week, 40 so-called \u2018jihadis\u2019 to come back into Australia unmanaged. Labor has always supported the intent of TEOs \u2013 which is why we have taken every step to ensure the scheme works, keeps Australians safe, and is constitutional. The reality is, Australians who have gone overseas to join the so-called \u2018caliphate\u2019 do pose a risk to the safety and security of our country. Their return, including those returning to face criminal charges, must be controlled appropriately. Given this risk, Labor was not prepared to leave Australia without a scheme to control their return, like Mr Dutton has done for the past four years. Labor moved amendments in both the House and the Senate to give full effect to the bipartisan recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS). These recommendations were handed by the chair of the PJCIS, Liberal MP Andrew Hastie, to Peter Dutton himself and signed off on by all members of the committee \u2013 including Liberal members Eric Abetz, Amanda Stoker, David Fawcett, Julian Leeser and Jason Wood. Regrettably, the Liberal MPs and senators voted against their own recommendations \u2013 marking the first time since 2013 that the government has rejected outright recommendations from the bipartisan PJCIS. Instead of working to improve legislation, the home affairs minister and the government have taken the dangerous step of fracturing the bipartisan approach to Australia\u2019s national security and the compact of the PJCIS. Minister Dutton also refused to release the government\u2019s legal advice to put to rest concerns about the constitutionality of the legislation. When it comes to keeping Australia safe from countering violent extremism and terrorism we should expect and demand more than a home affairs minister and government that plays political games such as these. Annnnnnd there goes the House Temporary exclusion orders have passed \u2013 and the Senate has adjourned. A small mystery this parliamentary week is why the Coalition removed a 12-month amnesty for employers who fail to pay workers\u2019 superannuation from a government bill, when the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, told Guardian Australia it remains government policy. On ABC TV, Christian Porter, minister for industrial relations, was asked where the amnesty is at. He replied: \u201cIt remains in the bill but my recollection as to what precise amendment might have been made on that I couldn\u2019t quite say. I think that\u2019s not one of the matters that was changed. But the bill did go through a range of amendments based on committee recommendations and those amendments were to bring the bill as closely into line with corporations law as could possibly be achieved with respect to registered organisations.\u201d That answer is wrong \u2013 because the amnesty was removed from the Treasury Laws Amendment (2018 Superannuation Measures No. 1) bill 2019 - and is also confused, because the second half appears to relate to the Ensuring Integrity bill, which never contained the amnesty. But in any event, despite the confusion it seems clear the amnesty for employers who don\u2019t pay super IS still policy. Patricia Karvelas asks whether unauthorised strike action could see unions in trouble under the ensuring integrity bill. Christian Porter tells Afternoon Briefing: Well, the structure of the bill as it sets out quite clearly, what are the types of behaviour, unlawful behaviour which could trigger an application issuer against a sitting public official or where there\u2019s lots of that behaviour occurring against registered organisation itself. But of course the point I think is that these are triggers which then require an argument by someone with sufficient standing before the federal court. As to why the pattern of unlawful behaviour warrants an organisation or part of an organisation, say a branch being deregistered, and then the court would have to consider whether that was just in all the circumstances. So there are all of the usual safeguards and steps and requirements and burdens and things that must be shown and proven. But this is just a minimum standard for lawful behaviour in the workplace. So that is a yes then. Basically. You may remember from earlier this week, that Ed Husic has decided he has had enough of lightly stepping around Peter Dutton and declared Dutton \u201ccould not be trusted\u201d on national security. Today, in a statement to the House, he doubled down, saying he did not believe Dutton was \u201cworthy\u201d of the crucial portfolio. National security is one of the most critical functions of government. The safety of the nation is a principal threshold priority. It should remain shielded from politicisation, so that the Australian public can remain confident that no one is playing games with national security. Yet, through his actions, the minister for home affairs has demonstrated he is not worthy of this portfolio. He cannot be trusted and he cannot help himself from prompting politicking above the solemn duty to do the right thing when it comes to national security. Look at his track record. He has trashed the bipartisanship that\u2019s guided national security debate. He\u2019s deliberately misled the public with falsehoods about the medevac legislation that have proven to be wrong. Under his watch, journos\u2019 homes get raided. Yet investigations into how Asio documents fall into the hands of the media gets dropped. He ratted on deals to fix up the encryption legislation that\u2019s hurting Australian tech firms. Metadata that is supposed to be used under strict terms is being abused and his department refused to provide legally required reports on what\u2019s happening with its use. Millions of dollars in government contracts were awarded to Paladin under his watch. Foreign fighter laws, that took years to get here, still aren\u2019t here properly. He cannot be trusted. We are on to him, and we will not rest. Seems like everyone is keen to get out of here today. The Senate looks like it is reordering business, at the request of the government, to move all the routine business aside, so the temporary exclusion order can be discussed. Labor is supporting that, so the Senate will sit until that is passed (which it will be, because Labor is supporting the bill) and then the Senate will rise until Monday. Mathias Cormann: I move that \u2026 (1) The routine of business for the remainder of the day be consideration of government business only. (2) Divisions may take place after 4.30 pm. (3) The Senate shall adjourn without debate after it has completed consideration of the Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Bill 2019 and a related bill, including any message from the House of Representatives, or a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister, whichever is the earlier. Just in case you missed some of the Angus Taylor stories from Lisa Cox and Anne Davies, you can find them here, This is an issue which hasn\u2019t got a lot of airplay in the parliament today, but Richard Di Natale has released a statement on this story: In the same week UK courts declared British arms exports to Saudi Arabia to be unlawful, a large shipment of Australian-built remote weapons systems left Sydney airport. Secret photographs, obtained by Guardian Australia, confirm the identity of the buyers \u2013 the Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates governments, whose forces are currently waging a devastating war in Yemen. Also marked are the suppliers of the equipment, which the manufacturer boasts is \u2018significantly enhancing lethality\u2019 in combat. Di Natale: While other nations around the world ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia, and the US Senate recently blocked sales to both the UAE and Saudi Arabia, Australia is continuing to profit off both nations\u2019 warmongering, while remaining tight-lipped or wilfully ignorant about where our weapons are ending up. By shipping weapons to these two regimes, we\u2019re contributing to an unfolding catastrophe in Yemen, pouring fuel onto a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and been described by observers as the \u2018world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis\u2019. This is inexcusable and callous ignorance. By permitting and profiting off these sales, Australia is tacitly allowing the UAE and Saudi regimes to continue a war that\u2019s left 24 million people in need of help. It\u2019s time to end our arms trade with human rights abusers, and rip up the government\u2019s obscene plans to make Australia a global arms dealer. Bill Shorten has released a statement on the Senate call for the disability abuse royal commissioners to stand down: ... The Senate has now backed the calls of the Australian Labor Party and the disability community for the Government to act to preserve the integrity of the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability. This commission is a chance to let sunlight in, expose historical wrongs and learn from them so we can provide better services to people with disability and eradicate abuse and neglect from their lives in the future. But that will be impossible to achieve if we have two commissioners who could end up in charge of investigating themselves, their former colleagues or their former workplaces. John Ryan is an ex-Liberal politician, NSW shadow minister for disability, and a public servant who had oversight of residential care programs for people with disability in NSW. Barbara Bennett was deputy secretary for families and communities at the Department of Social Services and at various times oversaw the Commonwealth workplace health and compensation scheme, the National Redress Scheme, welfare, family safety, housing and homelessness, and grants to the disability sector. Barbara Bennett and John Ryan should have already listened to the voices of the disability community, recognised that they are fundamentally conflicted, and stood down from these roles. Since they have not then it falls to the Coalition Government to do the right thing and remove them. Labor has called for this. Sixty groups representing people with disability have already called for this. Now the Senate is calling for it. Time is up for these two. It\u2019s time for the Government to act. The division ends as it was always going to and question time ends, with Scott Morrison commending all the new members, and giving a particular mention to Peta Murphy, the Labor member for Dunkley, who told the House her breast cancer had re-emerged two weeks after her election, and sends her the House\u2019s best wishes. Time for the final divide. The parties swap sides of the chamber. Scott Morrison is yawning (I get it) and chatting to Darren Chester and Josh Frydenberg. Anthony Albanese is talking to Mark Butler, Jim Chalmers and Matt Keogh. No one is talking to Michael McCormack. Yup. Terri Butler seconds Tony Burke\u2019s original motion. \u201cThe minister is going to have to come clean eventually and he should just do so now,\u201d she says. Christian Porter gets up to ask that she no longer be heard. We divide. The papers are not only stacked in front of Scott Morrison, his diary and phone are on top of them. FREEDOM AWAITS US ALL*. *Except those in Manus and Nauru This will fail (insofar as what Labor wants to achieve) and then another Labor frontbencher will get up and then Christian Porter will move that they are no longer heard, and the House will divide again. The government has the numbers to back Porter\u2019s call. The papers are stacked in front of the PM, so he\u2019ll probably call time on QT at the end of all that. Will Fowles, the Victorian state Labor MP police spoke to this morning, after a door was damaged in a Canberra hotel, is taking immediate leave The motion to suspend standing orders has been called. Here is the motion Labor wants to move Tony Burke seeks leave to move a motion to suspend standing orders. He wants an explanation to the House from Angus Taylor, covering off the questions Labor has asked today. The government has the numbers in the House. This will go no where. Scott Morrison: We have talked a lot about the impact of thuggish unions and them trying to thieve workers\u2019 wages and we know about the union coming here and trying to kick down doors of Parliament House, as we saw in 1996, but this week we had a state Labor party come and try to kick down the door of a hotel room, Mr Speaker. That is the sort of behaviour they think is OK in the Labor party, and we are seeing that in the same way. Tony Burke: Mr Speaker, I accept with a question like that it is really hard to not be relevant. The question was as broad as it could possibly be. And the prime minister has managed not to be relevant to the question. Tony Smith says he thinks the prime minister has finished his preamble, and Morrison gets down to drought, tax and WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON, probably. This dixer is literally: Will the prime minister update the House on further action the government has taken this week to deliver on its priorities? Zali Steggall to Scott Morrison: Businesses in Warringah are bound by Australian consumer law. In particular, they\u2019re not allowed to mislead and deceive customers about their products or services, yet in contrast, it is a free-for-all in political advertising during campaigns, where misleading and outright false claims are made by all sides of politics, resulting in a loss of trust in our political system and undermining of our democracy. Will the government introduce or support legislation for a minimum standard of truth in political advertising during political campaigns? Steggall is referring to some of the ads which were run against her during the election campaign. Morrison: And I thank the member for Warringah for her question. She would be aware that the joint standing committee on electoral matters undertakes a review of all matters in relation to the conduct of the most recent election and it will bring forward a report and that will be considered indeed by the government and the parliament and that is the appropriate place for those matters to be addressed and to be considered as they come before this parliament. But I would agree with the member for Warringah that the activities by GetUp in the most recent election and the actions they took against the former member for Warringah was some of the grubbiest and some of the most despicable actions I\u2019ve seen (\u2018what, are you jealous\u2019, yells someone from Labor) by what is, indeed, a political organisation masquerading as something independent, Mr Speaker. And the actions that GetUp took against by the former member for Warringah, and stood up to by the member for Boothby and I commend the member for Boothby for staring them down at the last election, and also the member for Dickson, the member for Kooyong, and I\u2019m so pleased to see them here again, Mr Speaker because the Liberal party and the National party will never be intimidated by the bullying tactics and the big union money that goes into GetUp and the Labor party. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: My question is to the Minister for Energy and emission reduction and I refer to his previous answer. Did the minister\u2019s meeting with departmental officials discuss any of the following matters later references in departmental correspondence about the threatened species. Whether the minister could act against the committee\u2019s advice and if the minister acted against the committee\u2019s advice could the minister keep the reasons secret? Taylor: The briefing was a technical briefing with respect to a revised listing of the EPBC which had the potential to impact thousands of farmers in my electorate, their livelihoods, their well being. Peter Dutton: We know that during the course of this last election, only in May of this year, that vessels had already departed in anticipation of a Labor government being elected. Mr Speaker, there were 41 people on a boat, on their way to Australia, anticipating a Labor government and the Labor Party had, just before the election, decided to introduce a very dangerous bill called the Medevac law which - which sent the wrong message to Sri Lanka and elsewhere. They have been all over the place for years now when it comes to border protection policy. This Leader of the Opposition is trying to be as sneaky as the last Leader of the Opposition. He is trying to pretend to the Australian people that he\u2019s on their side when it comes to border protection policies but, of course, he is not, Mr Speaker. The Australian public\u2019s worked out Labor. They know that Labor remains weak on border protection policies and if Labor was ever re-elected, the boats would restart and the kids would be back in detention\u201d There was also a very serious and tragic series of terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka earlier this year. But strangely that doesn\u2019t seem to get a mention. Australian Council of Social Service head Cassandra Goldie has welcomed the Senate inquiry into Newstart: \u201cThis is yet another indication of the growing parliamentary support for an increase to Newstart. \u201cA Senate Inquiry will confirm the existing overwhelming evidence for an increase to Newstart and should not prevent the government from acting now and providing a minimum increase of at least $75 per week, which is urgently required.\u201d Andrew Hastie invites Peter Dutton to tell the chamber JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU. (Answer, as safe as possible because of Coalition policies, but OMG who knows what could happen with Labor). The next election is three years away. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: My question is to the minister for energy and emissions reduction. On Tuesday the minister said, and I quote, \u2018I have always disclosed my interests and I have been very clear about those interests\u2019. When did the minister relinquish his interest in the Cayman Islands? Christian Porter raises a point of order that it is outside his portfolio. Tony Burke says it relates to an earlier answer. But it\u2019s ruled out of order. Scott Morrison has embraced the opportunity to get some extra work done during question time with gusto. This is the fourth question time Labor has utilised its new \u201cweak link\u201d strategy (my terminology). But if you haven\u2019t caught on, the opposition has decided to shine a spotlight a little brighter on some of what it sees as the government\u2019s weaker links. Morrison is a good performer, and they know that, so they are benching him as much as possible. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: At the meeting to which the minister referred, did he ask for the listings? Was that the minister\u2019s idea or the treasurer\u2019s? Taylor: Look, Mr Speaker, I make absolutely no apology for seeking and receiving briefing on policies that affect the farmers in my electorate. And I am a proud farmer in my electorate and I will always seek and receive briefings on policies that impact them, Mr Speaker. That impact them. Terri Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer the minister to a claim he did not refer for a member to be present at his grasslands meeting. If it wasn\u2019t idea, whose was it? Did the treasurer advise the compliance officer was there \u2026 Taylor: The department determines who comes to these meetings. Let me be very clear. I didn\u2019t ask for, nor indeed know that, a compliance officer was present at the meeting. Ed Husic continues his trolling, this time aiming at Alan Tudge and telling him \u201cis this your serious face - raise your eyebrows more\u201d as Tudge talks about his many, many concerns about Labor not being supportive of the Westconnex project. \u201cTolls,\u201d Labor MPs call out. Tony Burke asks him to table the letter, because he says he has one with identical language, but a different date to the one Angus Taylor indicated. Taylor says it is a confidential document and can not be tabled. We move on. Tony Burke asks him to table the letter, because he says he has one with identical language but a different date to the one Angus Taylor indicated. Taylor says it is a confidential document and can not be tabled. We move on. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer the minister to his previous answer. When did the minister tell the prime minister that he had an interest in Jam Land Pty Ltd? Taylor: I have answered the question about the disclosure of my interest before. You need to answer the question as to why you are part of a grubby smear campaign against my family in this parliament and the New South Wales parliament and you are well aware of that. Mr Speaker, as I\u2019ve said, my indirect interest in that farm in Jam Land has been widely reported in the media and was declared in accordance with the rules. And on this side of the House, on this side of the House, before we came into the House, many of us were involved in farming and business. That\u2019s what many of us did. And the result of that is we have interests in family farms and that is fully declared through my family company, Mr Speaker. As has been widely reported in the media. Now, Mr Speaker, the reason this issue came up is several years ago, before I was in this current role, several years ago, I sought to ensure that my farmers were being fairly treated in the electorate of Hume under a revised EPBC listing. And that revised EPBC listing was having an impact on, and creating concerns, with my farmers, which were raised \u2013 which were raised, Mr Speaker, which were raised by the New South Wales famers and in National Farmers Federation on several occasions, Mr Speaker. And I read from the letter to the treasurer at that time. I quote: \u201cAt the time the listing was raised the NFF raised this, the then minister of environment and energy the now treasurer, the information available for public consultation did not provide any qualified assessment of the extent, distribution and the quality of the listing\u201d. The information provided is part of the review did not adequately analyse the ongoing risks, and thirdly, Mr Speaker, based on the information provided in the NFF\u2019s view it is highly unlikely an individual farmer would be able to assess their responsibilities under the EPBC. These were legitimate concerns, they were properly raised in the right context, Mr Speaker, because I stand up for my farmers. Josh Frydenberg has the next dixer and is demonstrating how to make three minutes feel like 10. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Butler jumped up, but Gladys Liu tried to beat him. She was originally called up then Tony Smith realised Butler had beat her to his feet and calls Butler. \u201cWell done, Gladys,\u201d one of her colleagues says. Butler: I refer him to his previous answer. I have a copy of the minister\u2019s statement of interests. Will the minister confirm it contains no reference whatsoever to Jam Land? Taylor: As I said a moment ago, my indirect interest in Jam Land has been widely reported \u2013 has been widely reported in the media ... and it was declared in accordance with the rules through my family company. Now, there are many ... who have farms. Who are part of family farms. And we invest through our family companies. That\u2019s how we own our farms. Now, those opposite who have never participated in small businesses or farming wouldn\u2019t understand that. They wouldn\u2019t understand that for a moment. Mr Speaker. This issue has been raised by those opposite as a grubby smear campaign against me and my family. A grubby smear campaign against me and my family and I can safely say ... that the work that I have done ... with respect to the listing that has been referred to in this place in the last 24 hours was to protect interests of the farmers in my electorate and they need protection against most, of all, the sorts of policies that those opposite brought to the last election. Michael McCoramack is Michael McCormacking his way through a dixer and talking about magistrates needing to go back to magistrate\u2019s school. Not even his own side is paying attention. Andrew Bragg was called to the vice principal\u2019s office Peter Dutton jumps up with a point of order about Ed Husic\u2019s (alleged) comment and asks him to withdraw it. \u201cWhilst the minister was on his way to this dispatch box there was an un-parliamentary and offensive comment by the member for Chifley and I ask him to withdraw it.\u201d \u201cOoooohhhh, I\u2019m getting to you,\u201d Husic replies. He\u2019s asked if he made an un-parliamentary comment. He says he didn\u2019t. We move on. \u201cThat went well,\u201d someone else from Labor calls out. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: I refer to the minister\u2019s answer yesterday about his declaration and the requirement to declare any relevant interest in any shares whether held directly or indirectly. The minister has not declared his interest in Jam Land. Why? Taylor gets the call-up. \u201cMinister for dodgy omission*s,\u201d someone, who may or may not be Ed Husic calls out. Taylor: As I made absolutely clear yesterday, my indirect interest in Jam Land, which is part of our family farms, has been widely reported in the media, and was declared in accordance with the rules, Mr Speaker. In accordance with the rules. It is very clear ... Labor gets a bit rowdy, so Tony Smith tells them to calm down. Taylor: As I said yesterday, I had no association, have no association, with the compliance action and I have never made a representation in relation to it, Mr Speaker. But I tell you what I\u2019ve made representations with respect to, with respect to the farmers in my electorate, Mr Speaker. The farmers in my electorate. And I note the comment from the member for Eden-Monaro yesterday that the issue wasn\u2019t raised with him. I have to confess, I wasn\u2019t surprised by it. Despite the fact that this listing covers his electorate as much as mine. I wasn\u2019t surprised one bit, Mr Speaker. I\u2019ll tell you why. I know why the farmers of Eden-Monaro aren\u2019t raising the issue with their local member, because he doesn\u2019t care. His constituents are raising it with me as are mine. We stand up for farmers on this side of the House. Those opposite simply don\u2019t. *I went back and checked this, he said omissions. I originally misheard. Christian Porter is back with another segment of WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON: UNIONS ARE TERRIBLE edition. Seems he has taken a leaf out of Labor\u2019s book, by writing all the questions on the same issue. Rebekha Sharkie has the independent\u2019s question: Mr Speaker, my question is to the minister for drought. Farmers in my electorate are grappling with the impact of climate change, hotter and drier seasons and more frequent severe weather events. For two successive years we had hail storms devastating our apple orchards leaving growers desperate for horticultural netting to safeguard from such disasters in the future. In 2018 you initiated work on climate change. Would you please advise the House on the content and timing for the strategy? David Littleproud: You are right, in April last year, one of the first achievements after becoming agricultural minister, my first ministerial council of all agricultural ministers, state and myself, was to be able to get an agreement on a nationally coordinated approach to help our farmers to adapt to a changing climate. With the support of the Victorian government, I need to acknowledge the former agricultural minister who took the lead and commissioned a report that was provided to the last ministerial council meeting in September last year. The final report will be provided in September this year. So it is important we get a coordinated approach between state and federal agencies to ensure that we\u2019re not duplicating expenditure. But it is also important to understand the work our farmers and the government has already done, particularly ... Our farmers have been adapting to a changing climate and we put $1.1bn a year to farmers to give them to tools to adapt to a changing climate for research they need. It is important to improve our landscapes. $1.1bn has gone into land care itself. A great movement has changed the practices of our farmers for the better, not only for environmental outcomes but profitability. Only last night, this government was able to pass the Future Drought Fund. $100m dividend, year in, year out. It is legislated. We will be going out and consulting with the community. What a crazy idea the government might go out and ask those whose money it is how it might be spent. We will talk about climate risk and make sure farmers take up the research and development we\u2019ve got to adapt to a changing climate. The government should be agile and be there to deliver money that is purposeful and will be spent properly. Milton Dick goes on my list for being the first to inflict Michael McCormack on question time. When will work on the Rockhampton ring road commence? Sliced White (AKA McCormack): As I said yesterday, as I said yesterday, work is phased in. When you have a $100bn infrastructure rollout across this nation ... work gets rolled out. What we\u2019re not going to do for when Labor makes election commitments in their own electorates prior to an election, we don\u2019t have to meet those particular commitments because Labor didn\u2019t win the election. News flash: Labor didn\u2019t win on May 18, we did. But we are, indeed, rolling out $100m of infrastructure right across the nation, Mr Speaker. And when it comes to the member who asked the question\u2019s electorate, we are spending $250m. Financial assistance grants up to $50m, Mr Speaker. Major projects, business case funded $25m. He\u2019s asked to stick to the topic. SW: As I hear the leader of the opposition say it is not local government, it is also state governments, we have to work in conjunction with the state governments. Maybe if the Queensland treasurer\u2019s house was near the road they might be forth right with approving the projects and let us get on with building them. In very exciting niche news, they have finally replaced all the blown globes in the chamber roof. This observation obviously has nothing to do with Christian Porter\u2019s dixer delivery. It is quite normal to look to above for escape routes. It always pays to be prepared. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: When will the prime minister cave into pressure from members of his government on changing the legislated changes to the super guarantee, making super voluntary, and include the home on the assets test just like he did on the National Energy Guarantee? Frydenberg: There\u2019s only one side of this place that is promising $34bn of higher taxes and it\u2019s those opposite, Mr Speaker. $34bn of higher taxes. And those opposite, and when it comes to superannuation, want to ban the catch-up contributions, Mr Speaker. \u201cCraig Kelly is more influential than you,\u201d someone, who may have been Stephen Jones, yells. Then we are back to WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON: UNIONS ARE TERRIBLE with Christian Porter. Christian Porter gets the first dixer on just how terrible unions are. THEY ARE VERY TERRIBLE (at times) is the gist of the answer. He includes this in his answer: Now, when we look at Queensland, there are proceedings that were commenced in December of last year against a CFMEU organiser for his behaviour towards a Queensland government occupational health and safety inspector. The construction site was Cairns Performing Arts Centre. The safety inspector was in the course of inspecting exit signage. He was confronted by the CFMEU official who, within centimetres of the face of the safety officer said, \u201cYou are an Fing dog\u201d. Not once, not twice, but three times. The up shot of all this... Tony Smith reminds him that you can\u2019t use un-parliamentary language, even in a quote. Porter wrote the answer, so this is all new to him. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Given the government has ruled out changes to the legislated increase to the superannuation guarantee, making superannuation voluntary and including the family home in the pension assets test, what is the prime minister\u2019s response to the many members of his government still campaigning for those very policies? Morrison: As the treasurer reminded the House yesterday, and I made it very clear in the lead-up to the last election, our policy is unchanged.\u201d \u201cWhose side are they on?\u201d someone in Labor yells. \u201cThey didn\u2019t get the memo!\u201d Morrison continues: And what I know is unchanged is the Labor party have a policy for $34bn of extra taxes on superannuation. They also have a policy that continues to to strip away the dividend imputation credits for retirees. That remains their policy and they continue to pursue these matters of policy as fixed items on the Labor agenda. We know why. Because Labor are always for higher taxes, Mr Speaker. Albanese tries for a point of order on relevance, but it is on the policy topic, so Morrison can continue. \u201cLabor, Labor, Labor,\u201d yells someone from the opposition benches. Morrison: Labor are for higher taxes and I\u2019ll tell you why \u2013 because they don\u2019t know how to control spending either. They went to the 2016 election and weren\u2019t voted in because the deficits were too big and in the 2019 election they weren\u2019t voted in because the taxes were too big. The answer is consistent. Labor can\u2019t manage money, they will be for higher taxes and bigger deficits. It is why they can\u2019t be trusted with the management of our economy and Australians who depend on essential services and a stronger economy can never rely on Labor. \u201cYou\u2019re the government,\u201d a Labor MP yells. Today is going well. Today, we all wish we were Nick Champion, who is allowed to miss this, because he got kicked out for 24 hours yesterday. I am still trying to work out how that is a punishment. What a time to be alive Craig Kelly is on ABC TV and is doing nothing to calm down the super split in the Coalition: The question that Senator [Andrew] Bragg was putting forward was that someone who is earning under $50,000, is that person better off having that money taken off them and put in a super account, or would they be better off having that as an increase in salary? And I think that is a reasonable debate to be having, and certainly all ideas in the space have to be welcomed. Scott Morrison, Mathias Cormann and Josh Frydenberg have all ruled out changes to super. Labor, the Greens and Centre Alliance are basically moving every single amendment the parliamentary joint security and intelligence committee wanted for the temporary exclusion bill, to force the government to vote against it. The bill will go through. CA will probably abstain, the Greens are not supporting it, but Labor is, even without the amendments. Labor just wants it on the record that the government did not support these recommendations. No one knows who wrote the letter, who gave him the letter, or what it says, or even why it didn\u2019t show up in any of the freedom of information requests. And yes, of course we are asking. But that doesn\u2019t mean we get answers. For those asking, here is the whole statement Rex Patrick made to the Senate on why he won\u2019t be supporting the motion for an inquiry into Angus Taylor: Patrick: I just want to state to the chamber that I\u2019ve been shown evidence that Minister Taylor was asked to make representation on behalf of some constituents. I disagree \u2026 ... If someone is presented with a concern by a constituent they should be allowed to go to a minister \u2013 I do that all the time. If I get a \u2026 Scott Ryan: Order! Senators Di Natale, Hanson-Young and Rice, please \u2013 other senators were heard in silence. Can we let Senator Patrick be treated with the same courtesy? Patrick: If I am presented with a concern by a constituent, I do go to ministers and I do ask them to get a briefing from a department. So what\u2019s happened is not unusual. It\u2019s not unusual for things that have happened to me. So, my problem with the motion is, and Senator Wong\u2019s statement, is that there\u2019s an error of fact in there in that ... in this instance I\u2019m quite satisfied that Minister Taylor was making representation on behalf of some constituents. Australians are continuing to abandon private health insurance, new data from the prudential regulator shows. Statistics released by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority today shows that 64,700 Australians dumped their private hospital cover last year, on top of more than 21,000 the year before. And the proportion of the population with private cover has fallen for the third year running, dropping from 45.6% to 44.6% in 2018. Coverage peaked at 47.3% in 2014. The falls come despite the government\u2019s hefty subsidies for the private health insurance industry through tax rebates and come amid warnings the system is \u201cbroken\u201d. Earlier this week, the head of one of Australia\u2019s biggest funds, NIB, said Medicare should be abolished and his industry propped up by making private insurance compulsory \u2013 a suggestion immediately rejected by the health minister, Greg Hunt. Pauline Hanson is on Sky News telling Chris Kenny that Labor senator \u201cKimberley Kitchiner\u201d who she thinks is \u201cgreat\u201d has reached out to her to set up some sort of formal working relationship, with regular meetings. We assume she means Kimberley Kitching. Hanson also says that Penny Wong has never spoken to her. Kenny seems to think this is OUTRAGEOUS. I mean, you could probably point him to Hanson\u2019s maiden speech for a refresher, but sure. You do you, Kenny. Labor\u2019s Katy Gallagher will respond to the appointment of Phil Gaetjens as head of Prime Minister and Cabinet at 1.30 in the Senate courtyard. Sarah Martin reported on this earlier this week but the Senate has passed another motion \u2013 this time calling for the disability royal commission senators, John Ryan and Barbara Bennett, to be replaced over what Jordon Steele-John has called \u201cunmanagable conflicts of interests\u201d. Bill Shorten had also raised concerns. The motion passed with the support of the Labor party, Centre Alliance, Pauline Hanson\u2019s One Nation and Jacqui Lambie. \u201cThese commissioners have lost the confidence of the disability community and they have now lost the confidence of one of the chambers of the Australian parliament,\u201d Steele-John said. \u201cTheir positions have now become untenable and they must be replaced. \u201cThe government must now, immediately, engage with [the] disabled to appoint new commissioners in line with the criteria set out by the community, our organisations and our supporters: is a person with disability; has minimal and manageable conflicts of interest; has respect and trust from people with disability and the wider community; has high-level standing and experience in the application of the law and their impact on people with disability; understands the rights, laws and policies for people with disability, particularly the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; has knowledge of all forms of violence inherent in all settings and the existing legal and policy frameworks; understands the way age, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, intersex status, ethnic origin or race intersect with disability and violence. Labor says it will put its motion for an inquiry into the conduct of Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg on Monday after it failed to get crossbench support. The Greens have also given notice they will move for a production of documents, including the letter Rex Patrick said he was shown that he told the Senate had satisfied him it was constituent matter. Linda Burney has also spoken on the Newstart inquiry. The government voted against it, hence her reference to them below: People can\u2019t find work because Newstart is inadequate. The Liberals and Nationals have no agenda and Australians doing it tough deserve better than a prime minister that doesn\u2019t even acknowledge Newstart is too low. Labor is determined to get Newstart working to lift people out of poverty and get Australians back into the workforce. The Western Australian police commissioner, Chris Dawson, has defended his officers after the revelation that on two occasions WA police applied for \u2013 and obtained \u2013 a journalist information warrant from a person not authorised to provide it. Dawson told 6PR radio the \u201cadministrative error\u201d was made shortly after law changes in 2015 which required a \u201chigher threshold\u201d to obtain metadata for journalists through a journalist information warrant, to be granted in consultation with an appointed public interest advocate. Dawson explained the WA Police had applied for a warrant from a judge in South Australia and then WA, but the first judge and the WA Police were under the mistaken belief he had been validly appointed. Dawson conceded that an invalid warrant can result in \u201ctainted\u201d evidence which must be disregarded by a court, but played down the metadata failure by claiming that there was \u201cno value\u201d in the telecommunications billing information police had access to as a result of the invalid warrants. Dawson declined to name the journalist. The WA Police have not yet explained whether the journalist was notified. The Senate will look into the Newstart payment after a motion from Rachel Siewert and Patrick Dodson won the numbers. Siewert in a statement: I\u2019m very pleased that the Senate has supported our reference to the Community Affairs References Committee. This week we\u2019ve had people from all sides of politics come out in support of an increase to Newstart which has not had a real term increase since 1994. This inquiry will also look into a wide range of issues that interact with Newstart and other income support payments including impacts of the current approach, the changing nature of work, mechanisms that set payments, as well as the role of independent and expert decision-making in setting payments. It is vital that the government pay close attention to this inquiry where we will hear from the community on what it is like to survive on Newstart. Their refusal to raise the rate is out of step with community expectations. I urge members of the community to make submissions to the inquiry. The motion is defeated, after the crossbench side with the government. Larissa Waters gives notice that she plans on moving a motion for production of documents regarding the Angus Taylor issue. Penny Wong: Minister Taylor has a direct interest in Jam Land. He has a \u2026 by another company, I think it\u2019s called Gufee Proprietary Limited, which is a third owner of Jam Land. There is no declaration of Jam Land on his own registered interests. The government\u2019s defence for Minister Taylor is that because he declared Gufee, which is another company which owns the shares in Jam Land, that\u2019s sufficient, that\u2019s sufficient. The whole point of declarations - the whole point - is that they go to declaration of conflict. They go to declaration of conflict of interest. You report the conflict on your register of interest, so it is a disclosed potential or actual conflict of interest. How can you disclose a potential conflict of interest if you hide the fact that you actually are, via another company, an owner in the company that has the issue in terms of the property and the environmental regulations? It is just hiding behind companies. That is the government\u2019s defence \u2013 oh, he declared it because he declared the other company. It\u2019s not a standard that the public recognise. Now, it may be, it\u2019s been put to me, \u2018well, he didn\u2019t make any money out of it\u2019 - that is not the test. I don\u2019t know if he did or didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know, I assume there was some impact on the value of the property or the use of the property. I mean, all of those issues can be explored. But that\u2019s not the test. The test is what is appropriate for a cabinet minister. And again, just go back to this: who else gets to ring up a cabinet minister in charge of a portfolio where there\u2019s been an environmental regulation imposed, that affects your property, and says can [I] have a meeting with the department to discuss it. It\u2019s only Minister Taylor, he\u2019s the only one. Do we really think that\u2019s the standard we expect for ministers of the crown? Kristina Keneally is asking who the letter Rex Patrick says he has seen, is from \u2013 and whether the whole Senate can see it \u2013 making the point that the Senate doesn\u2019t know if the letter writer is related to Angus Taylor. Rex Patrick is on his feet now and says he has been shown evidence that says Angus Taylor was asked to make a representation on behalf of a constituent. \u201cIf I am presented with a concern by a constituent, I do go to ministers and I do ask them to get a briefing from the department. So what has happened is not unusual,\u201d Patrick says. Patrick says he believes there is an \u201cerror of fact\u201d in the motion and he is \u201cquite satisfied minister Taylor was making representations on behalf of constituents\u201d. Larissa Waters points out the Greens tried to get their own inquiry into this issue (but it was a lot broader), which is slated to be voted on for Monday \u2013 but it is a lot broader and unlikely to get support. Waters says the Greens will support Labor and asks why the crossbench has gone cold on it. Penny Wong is on her feet in the Senate, delivering a statement by leave, on what she says is the government protecting Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg from an inquiry. The official statement on the prime minister\u2019s department staff changes is out: After a distinguished career in the public service, Dr Martin Parkinson AC PSM will conclude his tenure as Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet on 30 August 2019. I want to express my deep appreciation to Dr Parkinson for his record of service to Australian Governments and to the Australian people over many years. Martin has been a highly valued source of advice to me, both as Prime Minister and in other portfolios, and he has led the Australian Public Service with great distinction. His policy acumen across a range of domestic and international policy areas has helped Australia navigate a complex and rapidly changing world. I wish him well for the next phase of his career and I look forward to him serving the national interest in other capacities. Mr Philip Gaetjens will be the next Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The appointment was made by the Governor-General for a period of three years from 2 September 2019. Mr Gaetjens has held leadership roles in the Commonwealth and State public sectors as Secretary of the New South Wales Treasury between 2011 and 2015 and, most recently, as the Commonwealth Treasury Secretary. He has also served in a range of other senior executive positions in the Commonwealth and South Australian public services and as Chief of Staff to the Treasurer on two separate occasions. Phil will bring enormous experience to the position and help drive the Government\u2019s ambitious agenda over the next three years in delivering for the Australian people. He is the ideal candidate to steer the Australian Public Service into the future. Dr Steven Kennedy PSM will be appointed as the next Secretary of Treasury. He will move from being Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development. Steven brings broad expertise and strong leadership to the Treasury Secretary role. In recent years, he has led work on infrastructure planning and delivery, the cities agenda, regulatory reform, public data and digital innovation. Steven has twice been seconded to the Prime Minister\u2019s office, working as the Director of Cabinet and Government Business and Senior Economic Adviser. Climate change is not such a clusterhucked trash fire in the UK. Which means the conservatives can pass a 2050 net zero emissions target. And did. Which Labor is keen to highlight, now that Boris Johnson is prime minister and, well, Australia\u2019s emissions reduction target is ... not great. Mark Butler had this to say about it: The UK is an extraordinary demonstration of the impact of political maturity and bipartisanship when dealing with climate change. In 2030 Australia\u2019s pollution is projected to be only 7% below 2005 levels, well short of the government\u2019s inadequate commitment of a 26-28% cut. Compare that to the United Kingdom, which is currently projected to meet a reduction of 61% over the same time period. Their fifth carbon budget reflects a bipartisan process that is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The UK parliament has taken the science of climate change seriously and have acted in accordance. Scott Morrison should take a note from the UK handbook and work with Labor in delivering credible climate policy. Mawwiage....... (If you don\u2019t get that reference, read a book! (and then see the movie)) The House is dividing for the third reading of the medevac repeal vote. It will pass the House. Then it heads to the Senate, where, as we\u2019ve been reporting since earlier this month, it will do nothing for at least a couple of months. The bill is in committee, which is not due to report back until October. The Senate won\u2019t sit again until November. So there is a bit of time for both sides to make their cases to Jacqui Lambie. Scott Morrison ends the press conference after this question: Back to the public sector, the economy is facing a testing time at the moment and you have also implemented or are working on Ember mentation of the Royal Commission, did you take that into consideration when you change horses in Treasury smoke a confident of this process? Morrison: Absolutely. That may be clear because this came up in Question Time yesterday, there is already legislation that has passed Parliament in regarding implement in recommendations, many of the recommendations don\u2019t require legislation and are being appointed in a ministry capacity. But there is quite a bit of legislation out there and expose a draft for public consultation. What we need to be very careful to do is particularly you would know, writing for the AFR, we have to be careful in the precision of this legislation when it comes forward into the Parliament. I\u2019m not going to rush that and see things for new legislation that could have been addressed the to the consultation period. I\u2019m going to make sure we give that time to work with the sector to make sure these legislative responses are correct. I don\u2019t understand labour \u2018s position. What are they expecting, that we should have some rushed legislation? That\u2019s how we end up with pink bat fiascoes. And overpriced school halls when you don\u2019t take care and making responses to these things. And we are taking care. This is a very, very significant priority of the government, to get this right. Just as all the other matters are, and we will continue to just work through the process of delivering on our agenda and to deliver on that agenda, you have to be hand in glove. And you had the public service, working closely with strong leadership from the ministers and the Prime Minister, the expectation of performance and delivery and respect for the great capabilities of our public service. The ACT police have released this statement: At about 7.50am today ACT Policing received a report of a disturbance at a hotel in Kingston. Officers on patrol nearby attended and the matter was resolved. At this time, no charges have been laid. Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the incident in consultation with the business owners. For privacy reasons, ACT Policing cannot comment on whether a particular individual is under investigation or not. On Andrew Bragg\u2019s super views: Well, I respond by as I always do encouraging all my members to participate in the policy process, and we have many of those processes. In fact, the primary way we do that is through our internal processes as a party. When people give their first speeches, their made speeches in parliament, it is not unsurprising that people will set out broader especially personal views, and I welcome that. That is what we have seen in first speeches in this place for a very long period of time. And I think it is important that members and senators have the opportunity to do that, especially in their first speeches, so I wouldn\u2019t over interpret on that front ... On the points of policy that you raised, I have been very clear. The government\u2019s policy has not changed. The treasurer made that very clear also yesterday in question time. Because I am very keen to ensure, especially in a time of low-wage growth, which we have, it has been modest, I have always acknowledged that, in the best way to improve that and improve what people have in their pockets is to ensure they keep more of what they earn, and that is why we were so adamant at the last election and prior to that, and now, to deliver that tax relief which the Labor party sought to do everything they could to oppose, and they will always be for higher taxes, not for lower taxes, and that is something on which I know all members agree. Scott Morrison on whether there will be more changes: Well, I will always reserve that right to make further changes where I believe they are necessary. I think these are the ones that are necessary right now. We will have an acting secretary in infrastructure until such time as we make a permanent appointment in that area, but these are matters that I am looking at closely. I am working close with all the secretaries of all departments and agent fees, and I look forward to that continuing. I am obviously consulting closely with my ministers as well about the best set of arrangements that we can put in place. But when it comes to PM and C and Treasury, I think you\u2019ll agree they are fairly central agencies but we will continue to work with others as government dictates. Scott Morrison was VERY prepared for this question: Appointing your former senior adviser as the head of the bureaucracy will inevitably be seen as a politicisation of the bureaucracy. How can you give an undertaking undertaking that that traditional break between departmental officials and the political wing of government will be maintained? Morrison (who goes to read from a piece of paper in front of him): Well, in the same way that previous Labor prime ministers have been able to give that same obligation and accountability and commitment to the Australian people, in the numerous appointments they have made of everyone from Don Russell to Tim Lee, Geoff Ferry, Richard Mort. This is not uncommon that people have worked in the political sphere and the bureaucratic sphere, because it is both, and where they have that experience, I think that AIDS them well in the tasks that they have. In the secretaries that I currently have working under the Coalition government, Rosemary Huxtable, Steven Kennedy, Daryl Quinlan, Frances Adamson, all of them have served in both political roles for Labor and are doing an outstanding job for me in the secretary roles they have. It is about merit and it is about quality. And in the two appointments I have announced today, I believe that the two men have done an extraordinary job, and have earned my trust and my respect and the respect of my government. The Treasury boss and former chief of staff to Scott Morrison when he was in Treasury \u2013 Phil Gaetjens \u2013 has been named Morrison\u2019s new departmental secretary. Steven Kennedy, who is in infrastructure, will move over to Treasury. Steven has obviously worked on the Labor side, Phil has worked on the Coalition side. This is about merit, this is about people that know how to get a job done, and people have earned the respect for the roles that I think they will now be able to serve in. Scott Morrison continues: The review is in its final stages, but I have already made it clear in speaking to all the secretaries of all departments, in fact, even before I swore my ministry in, what my expectations were. And this is of a very public-facing public service, a public service that is very focused on the delivery of programs, whether it is in our infrastructure programs and the pipeline of support to the states to get those projects happening, and water infrastructure, in delivering in the government services agenda where we have a new minister responsible for service in Australia, government services in Australia, these are the initiatives I want to see the public service focus on. Implementation, implementation, doing. And it\u2019s not just the regulations that can frustrate investment and getting services to people, whether it is Indigenous remote communities, supporting our veterans, or delivering education services in a major capital cities. It\u2019s just not the funding and the regulations that can frustrate this. It can just be the practices of administration within the bureaucracy. And I know that frustrates the bureaucracy as much as it can those who are expecting and waiting on those services. So that\u2019s the culture of service that I want to see in the public sector, and that is the approach I\u2019ll be taking and working closely in partnership with the secretaries. Scott Morrison: But the purpose of being here today is to say, when it comes to the public service, that is the engine room through which a government implements its agenda, and I have always had the good experience of working with the public service in providing very clear direction and leadership to the agencies I have worked with that enable them to get on with the job. And I have always seen the public service at its best when it is really getting on with things. I have had that experience in multiple portfolios, and as prime minister, I have seen it in the eyes of our public service officials when they are responding to difficult challenges. The north Queensland floods, I think, was a very good example of our public service at its best, responding to people\u2019s needs, understanding what needed to be done, getting rid of barriers that were in the way of them helping people. So when it comes to the public service, my view is to respect and expect. Respect their professionalism, respect their capability, respect what they can bring to the table and what they can do, and expect them to get on with the job of incrementing the government\u2019s agenda. That has always been my approach in working with the public service, across many portfolios, including as prime minister. Scott Morrison has welcomed Boris Johnson\u2019s elevation to the UK prime ministership: I had the opportunity to talk to Boris Johnson and congratulate him on being the elected leader of the UK Conservative party. Since then he has now become the prime minister of the United Kingdom. We are going to have a very strong relationship. I am looking forward to spending time with him on meeting with him at the G7 next month, and we are both looking forward to that opportunity. Moving very quickly, when the opportunity presents, to be able to move to an agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia on trade. We will be one of the first cabs of the rank, as has been the case in our discussions with the UK for some time. This is a time of change for the United Kingdom, and I think the new prime minister will bring a new opportunity, I think, to resolve what had been some very difficult issues, and that it is in the interest not only of the United Kingdom and Europe to resolve these matters, but for the order global economy to get some resolution of these issues. So I wish him all the best on those matters, and it was good to be able to catch up with him last night and I look forward to our meeting. Anthony Albanese is speaking against the medevac repeal bill in the House. He says it is possible to be tough on border security but still have humanity. Katharine Murphy tells me a replacement for Martin Parkinson, the secretary of Prime Minister and Cabinet, will be named at Scott Morrison\u2019s press conference. Peter Dutton wins the vote to suspend standing orders (no surprise there, the government has the numbers) and we move to the third reading of the medevac repeal bill. The Greens are getting ahead of Scott Morrison\u2019s public service announcement: Greens spokesperson for the public service, Adam Bandt MP, today commented on reports that the Prime Minister will make \u201cimmediate and sweeping reforms\u201d to the public service, warning that the Greens will fight to defend the public service from any attempts by an increasingly authoritarian government to weaken it. Without a policy agenda, this government seeks only to destroy,\u201d said Mr Bandt. The Prime Minister\u2019s words today are riddled with euphemisms that foreshadow an attack on the public service. The erosion of the public service has been steadily occurring under the old parties, through privatisation by stealth and relentless outsourcing. Now, emboldened by the election, the government looks to be preparing for a direct attack. The Greens will take up the fight to this government to defend the public service and will not allow the outcomes of the Thodey review to be a stalking horse to weaken the public service.\u201d Yup \u2013 it is about bringing on the third reading of the medevac repeal. Mr Dutton (Minister for Home Affairs), pursuant to contingent notice, moved \u2013 That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the motion for the third reading being moved without delay. Peter Dutton has called for a suspension of standing orders in the House (I think it is over the medevac repeal). Odds are Scott Morrison will be talking about this story in the Australian at his press conference: Scott Morrison has signalled immediate and sweeping reforms to the public service to make mandarins more accountable and ensure they are serving the \u201cquiet Australians\u201d, confirming a changing of the guard at the top levels of the bureaucracy. The Prime Minister has told The Australian he plans to move swiftly with a cultural shake-up across the 18 government departments and more than 100 agencies before the final recommendations from a 12-month review of the public service. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect the public service to run the government. That\u2019s what we were elected to do,\u201d Mr Morrison said. \u201cIn my experience, the public service always works best when it has strong guidance and leadership.\u201d By now aficionados of climate science/people who do not want the world to reach catastrophic levels of heating will be familiar with the distinction between weather (brrr it\u2019s cold today) and climate (oh my God, on average the world is 1.5 degrees hotter and we\u2019re headed for much more). But not so the Nationals MP George Christensen, who has this morning told his Facebook followers not to worry: Normally, on the road to Parliament House, MPs and Senators are greeted by extreme green protesters with alarmist banners banging on about global warming and declaring that there is a \u201cclimate emergency\u201d. This morning, with a temperature of -3 degrees, there\u2019s not a protesting soul in sight. I don\u2019t know why. For a north Queenslander, -3 degrees is a bloody climate emergency. It\u2019s just not global warming. Scott Morrison has called a press conference for 10.45am in the prime minister\u2019s courtyard \u2013 the Beyonc\u00e9 of political press conference locations. Rex Patrick\u2019s motion to suspend standing orders was defeated, 36 to 36 (when there is a tied vote, the status quo rules, which means continuing on with the schedule in this case). There seemed like an easy fix to this \u2013 giving Centre Alliance a private (and confidential) briefing of the advice. But that doesn\u2019t appear to have been made available, which is a strange tactic, given how important Centre Alliance is in the Senate. Oh, and Labor is still keeping count on government MPs. Ed Husic called for a quorum after noticing there were less than 31 government MPs this morning. For those who missed it, after the government pulled some shenanigans on Monday, rushing a bill through, Labor told the government it would play hardball of its own. And it is, calling for a quorum every time there aren\u2019t enough MPs in the chamber. Usually it is one of those rules that is just politely ignored. But not this week. The Senate is dividing to see if Rex Patrick can suspend standing orders. Doesn\u2019t look like he has the numbers. It\u2019s excitement plus in the House right now. The offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage amendment bill is being debated. I may need a fainting couch, I am so overcome. For those interested, there is also this: Police are speaking with a man at Civic police station. Pauline Hanson says she trusts the law is constitutional because the government told her it was The government denied Rex Patrick leave to move his motion \u2013 which is why we are having this debate. So it will come down to whether the rest of the crossbench supports him. Labor and the Greens are in. There could be two votes \u2013 one to suspend standing orders in order to move the motion. If that fails, that is it. If it succeeds, then there is another vote on the motion itself. It looks like Pauline Hanson is against it. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have reported this: First term Victorian Labor MP Will Fowles has been questioned by police over a disturbance at a Canberra hotel on Thursday morning. ...When approached for comment by the Age and the Sydney Morning Herald Mr Fowles would not comment on the incident but said he would make a statement later in the day. Rex Patrick is attempting to suspend standing orders in the Senate, in an attempt to demand the government release constitutional advice about temporary exclusion orders. There are questions over whether the legislation is constitutional. The bells are ringing - parliament is about to start. Remember how I said Labor had a spring in its step over the super split in the Coalition party room? This was Jim Chalmers this morning, speaking to ABC radio: This is a test of authority, of Frydenberg\u2019s authority and Cormann\u2019s, and also Scott Morrison\u2019s. Remember he went to the party room on Tuesday and said to his colleagues, \u201cplease stop talking publicly about super\u201d. And since then we\u2019ve had multiple Liberals out there bagging Frydenberg and Cormann\u2019s position. There are reports a MP has been involved in an incident at a Canberra hotel. Former journalist Kellie Sloane tweeted about the incident on Twitter Details are sketchy. Calls are in to PMO. We\u2019ll update you as facts come to hand. There were five names on this press release, but the future drought fund is a reality (the money won\u2019t flow until July 2020 though). Farmers and rural and regional communities which have been suffering years of unrelenting drought will now have access to the tools they need to prepare for, manage and sustain their businesses with the passage of the Future Drought Fund legislation through the Senate today. The Future Drought Fund will grow from $3.9 billion to $5 billion over the next decade, while facilitating a $100 million a year additional investment into drought resilience and preparedness, even in the good years, every year from 1 July 2020. The Government is backing in our farmers, and we will always stand up and support our drought-affected communities. The Future Drought Fund is about more than just money \u2013 it is about giving our farmers the best possible tools to face drought, now and in the future. Despite Labor\u2019s attempts to stop the Government from establishing the Future Drought Fund, the Government has delivered on its election commitment to guarantee a sustainable source of funding for vital drought resilience projects in rural and regional communities. A consultative committee will soon begin engaging with farmers and rural and regional communities to ensure the money is well spent when the additional funding becomes available from next year. The Government will work swiftly to establish the Future Drought Fund Consultative Committee and put in place rigorous governance arrangements for the appropriate selection and prioritisation of projects. Drought is a fact of life in this country. Our Future Drought Fund will ensure our farmers, who are among the best in the world and regional communities are better equipped to deal with its effects when it happens again. The Future Drought Fund comes on top of the Government\u2019s $2 billion in additional drought initiatives we have already previously announced. Marise Payne is off to Fiji: I will travel to Fiji from 24 to 26 July to represent Australia at Pacific Islands Forum ministerial meetings and further strengthen cooperation to promote security and prosperity in our region. At the special Forum Economic Ministers\u2019 Meeting on 25 July, ministers will discuss opportunities and proposals to support a resilient and stable Pacific. At the Forum Foreign Ministers\u2019 Meeting the following day, I will join other foreign ministers to discuss how we can work together to secure our region, the Blue Pacific, including through managing fisheries and finalising maritime boundaries. I am also looking forward to discussions on how we can strengthen regional security under the Boe Declaration. Australia is working with Pacific partners to implement two key regional security initiatives in support of the Boe Declaration \u2013 the Pacific Fusion Centre, and the Australia Pacific Security College. The Pacific Fusion Centre will inform responses to the security challenges our region faces, including illegal fishing, people smuggling and drug trafficking. The Australia Pacific Security College will strengthen regional security cooperation across the region. I will meet again with women parliamentarians in Fiji, including the Minister for Women Children and Poverty Alleviation, the Hon. Mereseini Vuniwaqa. I am also looking forward to visiting the Pacific Community\u2019s (SPC) Centre for Pacific Crops and Trees (CePaCT), an important initiative to assist Pacific island countries access vital seeds and staple crops, and the Fiji National University (FNU) to see Australian support for Pacific island students. Jacqui Lambie is one of the most popular people in parliament these days. Its amazing how having the swing vote can bring all the parties to the yard. The Tasmanian senator is the deciding vote in the medevac bill. She\u2019s keeping her powder dry in that one. But she\u2019s also a very important vote in the ensuring integrity bill. And on that, she had some interesting things to say to Phil Coorey in the AFR: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret I have concerns about the behaviour of certain members of the trade union movement. I have made these concerns very clear to Michele O\u2019Neil, [ACTU secretary] Sally McManus and John Setka.\u201d The bill isn\u2019t due for its final vote until after the winter break, in October or November. It\u2019s very on-brand for a Liberal to believe a scheme should be voluntary \u2013 the power of the individual is kind of their thing, after all. But this bit in Andrew Bragg\u2019s first speech to the Senate is what has eyebrows raised this morning: Compulsory superannuation is almost 30 years old. Super is now almost twice the size of the economy and the capitalisation of the securities exchange. We have the fourth-largest private pension pool in the world with only 25 million people. It remains a strange but huge experiment. The Centre for Independent Studies says one of the preconditions necessary to justify forced saving is that \u201cunder-saving for retirement will result in serious harm, including serious levels of old age poverty\u201d. Super fails at the first gate as the age pension underwrites Australians against old age poverty. Grattan Institute modelling shows super tax breaks will not pay for reduced pension outlays until the 22nd century, if at all! So what does this money do? Most of the funds invest in the same index-hugging way. The super industry contains layer upon layer of intermediation, with the same request from government: higher and higher mandatory contributions. As lawmakers, our duty is to focus on the public interest. I do not believe this system is working for Australians. Certainly the case has not been made for ever bigger super. I would change direction. Super should be made voluntary for Australians earning under $50,000. Taxpayers could simply tick a box to get a refund when filing an annual tax return. I commissioned modelling from Rice Warner actuaries, which estimates a saving to government of $1.8bn in the first year alone. Super is making home ownership so much harder for lower income Australians. The CIS found that the average deposit for a first home has doubled between 2000 and 2015. Since super started in 1992, every single age group has experienced lower levels of home ownership. Two answers must be provided, in my view, if we are to keep super as it is today: (1) will more super reduce future pension costs to government \u2013 and if so, by how much \u2013 and (2) how much better would retirement standards be if we had more super? The last Intergenerational Report showed around 80% of people would take a public pension in 2055. That is not good enough after 70 years of compulsory superannuation. Unless the next edition favourably answers these questions, I would be inclined to make the whole scheme voluntary. It\u2019s parliament Friday, which means the MPs are itching to get out and back home. But first there is the business of legislating. Or at least arguing about legislating. As well as arguing in the party room. Or, as we keep getting told, having \u201cthe conversations\u201d. Even if the conversations are not going anywhere. Or are not supposed to be. But despite both Mathias Cormann and Josh Frydenberg ruling out changes to super, it keeps coming up. Craig Kelly, who you might remember was saved from a looming pre-selection loss by Scott Morrison, the man who then went on to win the election for the Coalition, had his ideas, which he decided to air in the media. Then Andrew Bragg suggested superannuation for those earning under $50,000 should be voluntary. Plus, there is a group within the party room who are getting louder about scrapping the 12% superannuation guarantee. This has all come after Morrison told the party room to keep their lips shut, at least when it came to the media, and to air their views through the usual party room processes. That is going great. But it has put a spring in Labor\u2019s step, for probably the first time since the 18 May election, as the government\u2019s attempts to put the spotlight on unions and the ensuring integrity bill. Fun times. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp are on deck for you, and you\u2019ll find me in the comments and social media. Ready? Let\u2019s go.",

      "bodyText": "In the corner of Sarah Vaci\u2019s crowded Devon studio, beyond the piles of yarn, the self-portrait of the artist\u2019s backside, and the decommissioned ambulance stretcher, rests Kim Jong-un. In the wool fibres of his intricately actualised portrait, a twitching white fleck, the size of a grain of rice, is wrestling its way through his jet-black hair: a clothes moth larvae feasting off the North Korean leader. He is part of Vaci\u2019s Pest and the Profound, a trio of power portraits \u2013 Kim, Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin \u2013 whose needle-felted faces will be sacrificed to dozens of hungry larvae in an exhibition this week. When Pest and the Profound opens in a small Torquay gallery this week, the trio \u2013 each portrayed against imperial red backgrounds and housed in ornate gilded frames \u2013 will be suspended beside one another from a wooden beam, their 11kg portraits dominating the 84 square metre (900 sq ft) space. \u201cThey will appear disembodied; it\u2019s all a bit dystopian.\u201d says Vaci (pronounced Vaa-tzee), as she coaxes another larva through a hatch in the top of Kim\u2019s frame. \u201cI\u2019ve called the work Pest because what I\u2019m hoping the audience might consider is \u2018Which one is the real pest \u2013 the larvae or the leaders?\u2019\u201d Over the next 12 months, the tiny wardrobe adversaries should munch their way through the portraits until holes appear. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to subvert the way things are seen,\u201d Vaci says. \u201cI\u2019m very interested in the psychology of power and gender. I chose the three biggest egos on the planet and wanted to take them down a peg or two.\u201d The work took a year to complete, stabbing each fibre through (insecticide-free) plastic with a barbed needle, akin to tattooing with wool. \u201cVery satisfying,\u201d says the artist, \u201cparticularly when it\u2019s Trump\u2019s face.\u201d She adds that the work is making a point about gender as well as politics. \u201cI\u2019ve created three dominant men in a traditionally female medium and that brings a level of empowerment. I felt like I was subverting that imbalance as I created the faces of these alpha males.\u201d The artworks, priced \u00a315,000 each, are designed to look like tributes the men could have commissioned themselves. The opulent gold and vibrant red are a powerful combination: red for danger, strength? \u201cBlood,\u201d says Vaci. \u201cMoth larvae cocoons change colour according to what they eat so, eventually, there will be \u2018blood\u2019 splattered across the faces.\u201d She smiles broadly. Vaci is 41 and splits her time between Devon and London. She was born to Hungarian parents in 1977 and had a middle-class upbringing in London, attending an all-girls school, where she was desperately unhappy. \u201cI hated girls and being a girl. There was an implication it was better to be a boy.\u201d Her maternal grandmother was an artist, working with oils; her other grandmother made dolls clothes and puppets that line the eclectic walls of her Devon flat-cum-studio, along with prints of Boticelli\u2019s Venus and Mars and Gustav Klimt\u2019s The Kiss and giant murals. Vaci studied video installation art at the Kent Institute of Art and Design and, via the Marquis de Sade\u2019s novel The 120 Days of Sodom, embarked on an exploration of the hardcore and provocative. At one point, in the early 2000s, a film of her \u201cshitting and pretending to eat my own shit\u201d was projected on to a building in Hoxton Square, London. Concurrently, she taught video animation in prisons, hospitals and to children with autism and led workshops at the British Museum. When her son was born in 2010, she became severely depressed. This week\u2019s exhibition will also feature I\u2019m Just a Little Tired \u2013 a visceral umbilical cord noose made from wool, textile hardener and silicone. \u201cI want all my art to say to the viewer: \u2018Look again; look closely.\u2019\u201d Back in her flat, among the \u201cquality Devon potato\u201d boxes stuffed inside her storage cupboard, a plastic box containing old clothes, wool, strands of hair and a few drops of her son\u2019s wee have provided ripe living conditions for 140 moth larvae for the past five months. They are now at their most destructive and may not cocoon for another two years. So for now, in the artworks, they have 34 fibrous square inches of playground in which they can crawl through the crinkles around Trump\u2019s eyes or erode his gleaming teeth. \u201cI hope to turn textile art on its head,\u201d Vaci says. \u201cThere\u2019s a debate about the line between art and craft. For me, it becomes art when the context is what\u2019s dominant and interesting. I want people to be drawn to the meaning first and then ask, \u2018How did she do that?\u2019 As Grayson Perry so successfully did when he put pottery in a contemporary context.\u201d Social media previews of Pest have already attracted plenty of hate messages from Trump and Putin supporters. One recipient of Vaci\u2019s newsletter responded: \u201cThis is completely vile and disgusting. You are filthy!\u201d Whether you hate or embrace it, she sees her work as a type of essentialism. \u201cThere is an idea that the essence of a person is imbued in their image. So, a photo of your kids is just a photo but you might not cut it up. Nobody really wants to see faces eaten alive but it satisfies some tiny urge. \u201cIn my mind, the larvae are the revolution.

They view them as small and insignificant, but if they, the \u2018little people\u2019, eat them, then who has the last laugh?\u201d Sarah Vaci: Pest and the Profound is at the Artizan Gallery, Torquay, from 25-31 July",

      "body": "<p>One of the most evocative and powerful slogans of the 1968 Paris revolts was <em>sous les pav\u00e9s, la plage</em> \u2013 beneath the pavement lies the beach. Today in the UK, where more than three quarters of us live in cities, many people have lost touch with the natural world. They have forgotten the earth beneath their feet. Dave Goulson wants to reverse that dangerous trend and reconnect us with the wildlife that lives under our noses, in our gardens and parks: \u201cthe jungle that lurks just outside your back door\u201d.</p> <p>In the last 30 years, Goulson \u2013 a professor of biology who specialises in bumblebee ecology and founded the Bumblebee Conservation Trust \u2013 has had six different gardens, from \u201ca pocket-handkerchief rectangle\u201d to his current one, a \u201cslightly unkempt but delightful\u201d two acres. But every garden, large or small, is teeming with life, from the worms to the birds and butterflies. Beginning in the 1970s, Jennifer Owen \u2013 \u201cone of the great heroines of wildlife gardening\u201d \u2013 recorded the plants and creatures living in her little Leicester garden. In 35 years she found 2,673 species.</p> <p>Around the world, industrial farming and climate change are destroying natural environments and species at an alarming rate. Wildflower meadows used to cover much of lowland Britain: 7m acres of them in 1930s. Only 2% of these remain. Hedgehogs have declined in numbers by 50% in just the last 15 years. In parts of China, farmers now have to hand-pollinate fruit trees because pesticides have wiped out the bees. In the UK, orchards are typically sprayed 26 times a year with insecticides, fungicides and other chemicals: \u201cthose rosy, shiny apples on the supermarket shelf got there as a result of environmental carnage\u201d. But Goulson\u2019s message is one of hope: we can all make a difference by having wildlife-friendly gardens. Packed with remarkable details about the roles played by such unexotic creatures as ants and earwigs, the book shows how anyone lucky enough to have a garden or an allotment can transform it into a refuge for threatened flora and fauna.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>From attracting pollinators to creating environments for bees to nest in, this is an excellent guide to green gardening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gardening to save the planet is not that difficult, Goulson assures us: grow a variety of flowers, such as foxgloves for long-tongued bumblebees and thyme for honeybees, honeysuckle for butterflies and even ivy (there\u2019s a species of bee that depends on it). Plant trees if you have the space. Don\u2019t overly tidy your garden \u2013 a pile of old logs is a haven for insects. Create a miniature wildflower meadow by not mowing part of your lawn. Compost your kitchen waste and never buy peat-based compost. Dig a pond: rural ponds have declined by 70% since 1890 and they support some of Britain\u2019s rarest animals. And never use pesticides or weedkillers.</p> <p>From the best flowers to grow for pollinators, to creating environments for bees to nest in, this is an excellent guide to green gardening: \u201cIf you really want to leave your grandchildren a healthy planet to live on, it\u2019s time to get out in the garden and dig.\u201d</p> <p><em> \u2022 The Garden Jungle: or Gardening to Save the Planet by Dave Goulson is published by Cape (RRP \u00a316.99).

      "bodyText": "One of the most evocative and powerful slogans of the 1968 Paris revolts was sous les pav\u00e9s, la plage \u2013 beneath the pavement lies the beach. Today in the UK, where more than three quarters of us live in cities, many people have lost touch with the natural world. They have forgotten the earth beneath their feet. Dave Goulson wants to reverse that dangerous trend and reconnect us with the wildlife that lives under our noses, in our gardens and parks: \u201cthe jungle that lurks just outside your back door\u201d. In the last 30 years, Goulson \u2013 a professor of biology who specialises in bumblebee ecology and founded the Bumblebee Conservation Trust \u2013 has had six different gardens, from \u201ca pocket-handkerchief rectangle\u201d to his current one, a \u201cslightly unkempt but delightful\u201d two acres. But every garden, large or small, is teeming with life, from the worms to the birds and butterflies. Beginning in the 1970s, Jennifer Owen \u2013 \u201cone of the great heroines of wildlife gardening\u201d \u2013 recorded the plants and creatures living in her little Leicester garden. In 35 years she found 2,673 species. Around the world, industrial farming and climate change are destroying natural environments and species at an alarming rate. Wildflower meadows used to cover much of lowland Britain: 7m acres of them in 1930s. Only 2% of these remain. Hedgehogs have declined in numbers by 50% in just the last 15 years. In parts of China, farmers now have to hand-pollinate fruit trees because pesticides have wiped out the bees. In the UK, orchards are typically sprayed 26 times a year with insecticides, fungicides and other chemicals: \u201cthose rosy, shiny apples on the supermarket shelf got there as a result of environmental carnage\u201d. But Goulson\u2019s message is one of hope: we can all make a difference by having wildlife-friendly gardens. Packed with remarkable details about the roles played by such unexotic creatures as ants and earwigs, the book shows how anyone lucky enough to have a garden or an allotment can transform it into a refuge for threatened flora and fauna. Gardening to save the planet is not that difficult, Goulson assures us: grow a variety of flowers, such as foxgloves for long-tongued bumblebees and thyme for honeybees, honeysuckle for butterflies and even ivy (there\u2019s a species of bee that depends on it). Plant trees if you have the space. Don\u2019t overly tidy your garden \u2013 a pile of old logs is a haven for insects. Create a miniature wildflower meadow by not mowing part of your lawn. Compost your kitchen waste and never buy peat-based compost. Dig a pond: rural ponds have declined by 70% since 1890 and they support some of Britain\u2019s rarest animals. And never use pesticides or weedkillers. From the best flowers to grow for pollinators, to creating environments for bees to nest in, this is an excellent guide to green gardening: \u201cIf you really want to leave your grandchildren a healthy planet to live on, it\u2019s time to get out in the garden and dig.\u201d \u2022 The Garden Jungle: or Gardening to Save the Planet by Dave Goulson is published by Cape (RRP \u00a316.99).

Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation \u2013 set for 2 August \u2013 was announced late on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>A crowd of demonstrators outside the governor\u2019s mansion in Old San Juan erupted into cheers and singing after his announcement on Facebook Live just before midnight.</p> \n<p>Addressing the protests, Rossell\u00f3 said, \u201cThe demands have been overwhelming and I\u2019ve received them with highest degree of humility.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rossell\u00f3 said he would be replaced by his justice secretary, Wanda V\u00e1zquez, a former prosecutor who headed the US territory\u2019s office of women\u2019s affairs. V\u00e1zquez is next in line to succeed Rossell\u00f3 after secretary of state Luis Rivera Mar\u00edn resigned over the scandal earlier in the month.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat I wish most is peace and progress for my people,\u201d the governor said in a pre-recorded message that also sought to tout his record, and ignore allegations his administration has been plagued by corruption.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of thousands have lined the streets of Puerto Rico during some of the largest demonstrations in the US territory\u2019s history. The protests began in response to hundreds of pages of leaked text messages between Rossell\u00f3 and 11 members of his inner circle, who partook in a series of homophobic and sexist jokes.<a href=\"http://periodismoinvestigativo.com/2019/07/las-889-paginas-de-telegram-entre-rossello-nevares-y-sus-allegados/\"> Others mocked the victims of Hurricane Maria</a>.</p> \n<p>Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation had seemed increasingly inevitable after key members of his party, the New Progressive party, began to abandon him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/19/puerto-rico-governor-ricardo-rossello-protests\">last week.</a> Pressure mounted further on Wednesday when the Puerto Rican legislature announced that it will begin impeachment proceedings for<strong> </strong>Rossell\u00f3<strong> </strong>unless he resigned. Lawyers commissioned by the president of Puerto Rico\u2019s House of Representatives found multiple offenses that constitute grounds for impeachment, according to <a href=\"https://www.telemundopr.com/noticias/destacados/Revelan-informe-de-abogados-nombrados-por-Johnny-Mendez-513086941.html\">Telemundo</a>.</p> \n<p>Senior Republicans and Democrats in Washington, including a number of Democratic candidates for president and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself of Puerto Rican descent, had also called for Rossell\u00f3 to go. Although Donald Trump branded the Rossell\u00f3 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/puerto-rico-protesters-block-highway-governor-ricardo-rossello\">a terrible governor</a>\u201d on Monday, the White House stopped short of calling for his departure.</p> \n<p>But the governor\u2019s resignation was largely the result of a sustained popular movement that spanned generations and party political allegiances, and was without a formal leadership structure. The movement led to a general strike on Monday, which saw hundreds of thousands shut down one of the major highways in the island\u2019s capital, San Juan.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/puerto-rico-police-clash-with-protesters-against-governor-ricardo-rossello-homophobic-texts\">Last Wednesday</a> a number of high-profile Puerto Ricans, including the singer Ricky Martin and the reggaeton star, Benito Antonio Ocasio, known by his stage name,<strong> </strong>Bad Bunny, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/puerto-rico-ricky-martin-bad-bunny-protest-governor\">led demonstrations</a> to the governor\u2019s residence in San Juan. The musicians were also present during Monday\u2019s general strike.</p> \n<p>The protests have remained largely peaceful, but police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protests on a number of evenings as protesters thronged onto the cobblestoned streets of old San Juan.</p> \n<p>The text message scandal is the culmination of many Puerto Ricans\u2019 deep dissatisfaction with local government and federal administrators.</p> \n<p>Rossell\u00f3\u2019s tenure has been plagued by corruption scandals since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017. Shortly before the leaked texts were published the FBI arrested a number of former administration officials and contractors, including the former education secretary, over corruption allegations involving the alleged misappropriation of $15.5m (\u00a312.5m) in federal funds apportioned to Puerto Rico after Maria.</p> \n<p>The island\u2019s economic affairs are largely dictated by an unelected fiscal control board, imposed by the Obama administration and appointed in Washington, referred to locally as la junta.</p> \n<p>The territory has seen waves of austerity across all areas of public services as it grapples with a multi-billion debt crisis accumulated over decades.</p> \n<p>Puerto Rico is due to hold gubernatorial elections in November 2020.<br></p>",

      "bodyText": "Puerto Rico\u2019s embattled governor has announced his resignation following almost two weeks of continuous mass protest on the island tied to a leaked text message scandal that saw him gradually abandoned by his own party. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation \u2013 set for 2 August \u2013 was announced late on Wednesday. A crowd of demonstrators outside the governor\u2019s mansion in Old San Juan erupted into cheers and singing after his announcement on Facebook Live just before midnight. Addressing the protests, Rossell\u00f3 said, \u201cThe demands have been overwhelming and I\u2019ve received them with highest degree of humility.\u201d Rossell\u00f3 said he would be replaced by his justice secretary, Wanda V\u00e1zquez, a former prosecutor who headed the US territory\u2019s office of women\u2019s affairs. V\u00e1zquez is next in line to succeed Rossell\u00f3 after secretary of state Luis Rivera Mar\u00edn resigned over the scandal earlier in the month. \u201cWhat I wish most is peace and progress for my people,\u201d the governor said in a pre-recorded message that also sought to tout his record, and ignore allegations his administration has been plagued by corruption. Hundreds of thousands have lined the streets of Puerto Rico during some of the largest demonstrations in the US territory\u2019s history. The protests began in response to hundreds of pages of leaked text messages between Rossell\u00f3 and 11 members of his inner circle, who partook in a series of homophobic and sexist jokes. Others mocked the victims of Hurricane Maria. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation had seemed increasingly inevitable after key members of his party, the New Progressive party, began to abandon him last week. Pressure mounted further on Wednesday when the Puerto Rican legislature announced that it will begin impeachment proceedings for Rossell\u00f3 unless he resigned. Lawyers commissioned by the president of Puerto Rico\u2019s House of Representatives found multiple offenses that constitute grounds for impeachment, according to Telemundo. Senior Republicans and Democrats in Washington, including a number of Democratic candidates for president and the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, herself of Puerto Rican descent, had also called for Rossell\u00f3 to go. Although Donald Trump branded the Rossell\u00f3 \u201ca terrible governor\u201d on Monday, the White House stopped short of calling for his departure. But the governor\u2019s resignation was largely the result of a sustained popular movement that spanned generations and party political allegiances, and was without a formal leadership structure. The movement led to a general strike on Monday, which saw hundreds of thousands shut down one of the major highways in the island\u2019s capital, San Juan. Last Wednesday a number of high-profile Puerto Ricans, including the singer Ricky Martin and the reggaeton star, Benito Antonio Ocasio, known by his stage name, Bad Bunny, led demonstrations to the governor\u2019s residence in San Juan. The musicians were also present during Monday\u2019s general strike. The protests have remained largely peaceful, but police have used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse protests on a number of evenings as protesters thronged onto the cobblestoned streets of old San Juan. The text message scandal is the culmination of many Puerto Ricans\u2019 deep dissatisfaction with local government and federal administrators. Rossell\u00f3\u2019s tenure has been plagued by corruption scandals since Hurricane Maria devastated the island in September 2017. Shortly before the leaked texts were published the FBI arrested a number of former administration officials and contractors, including the former education secretary, over corruption allegations involving the alleged misappropriation of $15.5m (\u00a312.5m) in federal funds apportioned to Puerto Rico after Maria. The island\u2019s economic affairs are largely dictated by an unelected fiscal control board, imposed by the Obama administration and appointed in Washington, referred to locally as la junta. The territory has seen waves of austerity across all areas of public services as it grapples with a multi-billion debt crisis accumulated over decades. Puerto Rico is due to hold gubernatorial elections in November 2020.",

She loves using it, but it\u2019s past its best and the battery won\u2019t hold a charge for very long. I am thinking of buying her a replacement. What should I go for? <strong>Hugh</strong></p> </blockquote> <p>If you\u2019re an artist who uses computers, <a href=\"https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/youve-never-had-it-so-good.html\">you\u2019ve never had it so good</a>, as former prime minister Harold Macmillan almost said. Touch-sensitive screens are becoming ubiquitous, so there are dozens of usable devices at a wide range of price points. However, they are not all the same, and people can be confused by the differences.</p> <p>At first, artists mainly used graphics tablets connected to personal computers, with Wacom becoming the dominant brand. In this case, you draw on the tablet with a stylus and your pen-strokes appear on a separate screen. It\u2019s a little like using a mouse.</p> <p>Later we got drawing tablets, where the blank surface of the graphics tablet has been replaced with a screen. Wacom is still a major player with drawing tablets such as the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Wacom-Interactive-Display-English-Language/dp/B00BSVADDY/\">Cintiq 13HD</a>, but there are cheaper options. XP-Pen\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Artist12-Graphics-Drawing-Battery-free-1920x1080-Artist-12/dp/B07GPX9T58/\">Artist16 Pro</a> has been getting good reviews.</p> <p>Graphics tablets and drawing tablets use the computing power of laptops or desktops, so they can handle the huge, detailed drawings required for architectural design and similar purposes. The tablet view may be just a window onto a much larger design.</p> <p>Today, almost all smartphones and tablets, and most hybrid or convertible laptops, have touch screens, so you can draw on them with your fingers. A smaller number support pens. The key point is that they are standalone devices. They don\u2019t need to be attached to a computer.</p> <p>The leading examples fall into three main ranges: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/12/apple-129in-ipad-pro-review-bringing-back-the-wow-factor\">Apple\u2019s iPad Pro</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/16/microsoft-surface-pro-6-review-windows-10-tablet\">Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro</a>. There are alternatives, but these are the ones to beat.</p> <h2><strong>Things to consider</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c4baf66862877e0561536e663ca2e77992a31d6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c4baf66862877e0561536e663ca2e77992a31d6d/0_0_3460_2076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"iPad Mini with Apple Pencil stylus landscape\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">iPad Mini with Apple Pencil stylus landscape</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Apple</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From a drawing point of view, the important points include screen size and resolution, the colour accuracy of the screen, pen pressure levels and latency. Basically, if you press harder, the pen should produce a stronger line. A pressure sensitivity of 2,048 is recommended. I can\u2019t tell the difference between 256, 1024 and 2048, but as an artist, your wife probably can.</p> <p>Latency refers to the delay between the pen or stylus moving across the screen and a line appearing. Latency used to be terrible on tablets. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem on the latest devices, though some apps are worse than others. The best way to check latency is to try a device. However, you can get a pretty good idea from watching people draw in YouTube videos.</p> <p>Standalone tablets, unlike graphics tablets, can perform many other functions. You can do your email, watch videos, play games and so on. Some people will choose one tablet rather than another because it runs particular software \u2013 such as Adobe Creative Suite \u2013 or particular apps. Some will be influenced by how well it works with their other devices and online services, such as Office 365. Many will be influenced by price, though you haven\u2019t given me a budget.</p> <p>With hindsight, it would be a good idea to check how much it costs to replace the battery in the tablet you choose.

      "bodyText": "My wife is an artist. She has been using a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 since 2014. This allows her to draw and paint using a stylus supplied with the pad. She loves using it, but it\u2019s past its best and the battery won\u2019t hold a charge for very long. I am thinking of buying her a replacement. What should I go for? Hugh If you\u2019re an artist who uses computers, you\u2019ve never had it so good, as former prime minister Harold Macmillan almost said. Touch-sensitive screens are becoming ubiquitous, so there are dozens of usable devices at a wide range of price points. However, they are not all the same, and people can be confused by the differences. At first, artists mainly used graphics tablets connected to personal computers, with Wacom becoming the dominant brand. In this case, you draw on the tablet with a stylus and your pen-strokes appear on a separate screen. It\u2019s a little like using a mouse. Later we got drawing tablets, where the blank surface of the graphics tablet has been replaced with a screen. Wacom is still a major player with drawing tablets such as the Cintiq 13HD, but there are cheaper options. XP-Pen\u2019s Artist16 Pro has been getting good reviews. Graphics tablets and drawing tablets use the computing power of laptops or desktops, so they can handle the huge, detailed drawings required for architectural design and similar purposes. The tablet view may be just a window onto a much larger design. Today, almost all smartphones and tablets, and most hybrid or convertible laptops, have touch screens, so you can draw on them with your fingers. A smaller number support pens. The key point is that they are standalone devices. They don\u2019t need to be attached to a computer. The leading examples fall into three main ranges: Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab, Apple\u2019s iPad Pro and Microsoft\u2019s Surface Pro. There are alternatives, but these are the ones to beat. Things to consider From a drawing point of view, the important points include screen size and resolution, the colour accuracy of the screen, pen pressure levels and latency. Basically, if you press harder, the pen should produce a stronger line. A pressure sensitivity of 2,048 is recommended. I can\u2019t tell the difference between 256, 1024 and 2048, but as an artist, your wife probably can. Latency refers to the delay between the pen or stylus moving across the screen and a line appearing. Latency used to be terrible on tablets. It doesn\u2019t seem to be a problem on the latest devices, though some apps are worse than others. The best way to check latency is to try a device. However, you can get a pretty good idea from watching people draw in YouTube videos. Standalone tablets, unlike graphics tablets, can perform many other functions. You can do your email, watch videos, play games and so on. Some people will choose one tablet rather than another because it runs particular software \u2013 such as Adobe Creative Suite \u2013 or particular apps. Some will be influenced by how well it works with their other devices and online services, such as Office 365. Many will be influenced by price, though you haven\u2019t given me a budget. With hindsight, it would be a good idea to check how much it costs to replace the battery in the tablet you choose. All the main ranges have sealed-in batteries, which does not bode well for their longevity. Battery degradation is also a risk factor when buying second-hand devices. Stick with Samsung As I\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s generally not worth changing systems unless you need to. When you switch, you give up a lot of valuable experience, you lose the comfort of familiarity, and you may have to find and learn a lot of new programs and/or apps. You shouldn\u2019t switch unless the new system delivers one or more significant advantages \u2013 not minor ones that all its rivals will add in a year or so \u2013 and does not come with numerous disadvantages.

As for the obvious problem involved in opposing Islamophobia and homophobia at the same time, well, Islam is hardly the only religion or ideology officially antipathetic to gay people, and there has to be room for reformation and evolutionary growth. \u2022 Are You Proud? is released in the UK on 26 July.",

A brilliant but wilful and unreliable presence (or, more often, absence) with a parallel solo career, Young eventually exceeded the popularity of the original members to the point where the $60,000 available for a concert performance by the trio in a large stadium became $600,000 if his participation could be guaranteed.

Peter Doggett, in the better of these two books, puts it neatly: \u201cCrosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young have spent approximately two of the past 50 years as a functioning band and the other 48 years fending off questions about why they are no longer together.\u201d Both he and David Browne, his rival author, strive to answer the question of how so brief and turbulent a heyday could have left so lasting an afterimage.</p> <p>CSN&amp;Y came together at a time when the music industry was overtaking films in Hollywood as the most prosperous and glamorous arm of show business. Its practitioners were encouraged to take advantage of all the personal and financial leeway this gave them. The musicians, rather than the men in suits, now called the shots \u2013 or so they believed. And they appeared at a moment of significant evolution in western culture, to which the critic Ellen Sander referred while welcoming their first album in the Saturday Review: \u201cIt is packed with songs of the changes that have made searchers of all of us.\u201d Barely half a dozen years after the Beatles had introduced themselves with \u201cLove Me Do\u201d and \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d, the scope of rock and roll had broadened; the topics of Vietnam-era political protest, ecological awareness and personal growth were all explicitly addressed by the four songwriters who pooled their work to create one of the first and certainly the most successful of the new generation of \u201csupergroups\u201d. Prefacing the era of the confessional first-person singer-songwriter (which, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/dec/20/popandrock.folk\" title=\"\">James Taylor</a> to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/10/taylor-swift-highest-paid-celebrity-list-kylie-jenner-kanye-west-lionel-messi-ronaldo\" title=\"\">Taylor Swift</a>, continues to flourish), they provided their audience with the sense of being given access to a private and privileged world of exotic couplings and hip luxury.</p> <p>At a time of hurtling progress, they were drawn together by musical ambition. Crosby had been sacked from<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/16/how-we-made-eight-miles-high-the-byrds\" title=\"\"> the Byrds </a>(for being a \u201clittle Hitler\u201d, in a former colleague\u2019s view); Nash had grown dissatisfied with the superficial pop music purveyed by his former group, the Hollies; and Stills and Young had been the most gifted members of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/sep/14/buffalo-springfield-neil-young-bridge-school-benefit\" title=\"\">Buffalo Springfield</a>, an LA-based band which had been tipped for great things but failed to deliver. They were four children of damaged families \u2013 the sons, respectively, of the cameraman on <em>High Noon</em>, of an elusive figure who made and lost several fortunes while hauling his family around the southern states and Central America, of a Manchester steel worker and of a Canadian newspaper columnist. And they found each other amid the growing musical community of Laurel Canyon, in the Hollywood Hills, where the original three discovered, with the encouragement of such friends as Joni Mitchell and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/jul/26/gender.uk1\" title=\"\">Mama Cass Elliot</a>, that when they sang harmonies together, one plus one plus one equalled more than three.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ed6b3ac8fc176ab4df2cff93a0b1fbcb38042aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ed6b3ac8fc176ab4df2cff93a0b1fbcb38042aff/359_206_2042_3304/618.jpg\" alt=\"Young also had a lucrative solo career.\" width=\"618\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young also had a lucrative solo career.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Putland/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rumours of their project provoked great excitement on both sides of the Atlantic. Having made their eponymous first album, which included such classics as Stills\u2019s \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes\u201d, Nash\u2019s \u201cMarrakesh Express\u201d and Crosby\u2019s \u201cGuinnevere\u201d, they added Young in time for their first concerts, with appearances at both Woodstock and Altamont before they made their European debut at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1970, at which they were unsettled by the reserved response of the British audience. With Young, they had already recorded a second album, <em>D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu</em>, whose highlights included Nash\u2019s terminally twee \u201cOur House\u201d, about his relationship with Mitchell; Crosby\u2019s \u201cAlmost Cut My Hair\u201d, a response to the shooting of Bobby Kennedy and the recent death of a girlfriend; and \u2013 sticking out a mile \u2013 the new recruit\u2019s plaintive \u201cHelpless\u201d. But Stills was already telling a British journalist: \u201cIt started out as a really beautiful idea. We were full of enthusiasm and ideals. Now a lot of that feeling has gone between us.\u201d</p> <p>Thereafter, in Doggett\u2019s words, it becomes \u201cthe tale of how four individuals battled to maintain their separate artistic identities when much of their audience simply wanted them to repeat the past\u201d. Neither book flinches from dealing with the way, to put it simply, the peace and harmony given by marijuana were taken away by the paranoia of cocaine.

      "bodyText": "On the day in early 1969 when David Crosby, Stephen Stills and Graham Nash had their photograph taken for the cover of their first album together, they sat in line on an old sofa, radiating hippie allure and authenticity, outside a deserted house on a West Hollywood side street. That evening, suddenly realising that they had posed in the wrong order (Nash, Stills, Crosby), they agreed to return the next day for a reshoot \u2013 only to discover that the house had been demolished overnight. As a metaphor for the destiny of what was, for a short time, the most popular rock group in the world, that would be hard to beat. Within months, entropy arrived in the shape of Neil Young, who became the fourth member of the group \u2013 and its fourth highly developed ego. A brilliant but wilful and unreliable presence (or, more often, absence) with a parallel solo career, Young eventually exceeded the popularity of the original members to the point where the $60,000 available for a concert performance by the trio in a large stadium became $600,000 if his participation could be guaranteed. Not surprisingly, his decades-long show of reluctance to rejoin them created considerable resentment, particularly when there were yachts to be repaired, thoroughbreds to be stabled and drug habits to be funded. The consequences of that ill feeling \u2013 the breakups and makeups, scandals over drugs and firearms, and a final backstage scuffle at, of all things, a Christmas tree-lighting ceremony at the White House in 2015, where they had performed \u201cSilent Night\u201d very badly in the presence of the Obamas and Miss Piggy \u2013 ensured that the group maintained some sort of public profile, even during their lengthy periods of inactivity. Peter Doggett, in the better of these two books, puts it neatly: \u201cCrosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young have spent approximately two of the past 50 years as a functioning band and the other 48 years fending off questions about why they are no longer together.\u201d Both he and David Browne, his rival author, strive to answer the question of how so brief and turbulent a heyday could have left so lasting an afterimage. CSN&amp;Y came together at a time when the music industry was overtaking films in Hollywood as the most prosperous and glamorous arm of show business. Its practitioners were encouraged to take advantage of all the personal and financial leeway this gave them. The musicians, rather than the men in suits, now called the shots \u2013 or so they believed. And they appeared at a moment of significant evolution in western culture, to which the critic Ellen Sander referred while welcoming their first album in the Saturday Review: \u201cIt is packed with songs of the changes that have made searchers of all of us.\u201d Barely half a dozen years after the Beatles had introduced themselves with \u201cLove Me Do\u201d and \u201cPlease Please Me\u201d, the scope of rock and roll had broadened; the topics of Vietnam-era political protest, ecological awareness and personal growth were all explicitly addressed by the four songwriters who pooled their work to create one of the first and certainly the most successful of the new generation of \u201csupergroups\u201d. Prefacing the era of the confessional first-person singer-songwriter (which, from James Taylor to Taylor Swift, continues to flourish), they provided their audience with the sense of being given access to a private and privileged world of exotic couplings and hip luxury. At a time of hurtling progress, they were drawn together by musical ambition. Crosby had been sacked from the Byrds (for being a \u201clittle Hitler\u201d, in a former colleague\u2019s view); Nash had grown dissatisfied with the superficial pop music purveyed by his former group, the Hollies; and Stills and Young had been the most gifted members of Buffalo Springfield, an LA-based band which had been tipped for great things but failed to deliver. They were four children of damaged families \u2013 the sons, respectively, of the cameraman on High Noon, of an elusive figure who made and lost several fortunes while hauling his family around the southern states and Central America, of a Manchester steel worker and of a Canadian newspaper columnist. And they found each other amid the growing musical community of Laurel Canyon, in the Hollywood Hills, where the original three discovered, with the encouragement of such friends as Joni Mitchell and Mama Cass Elliot, that when they sang harmonies together, one plus one plus one equalled more than three. Rumours of their project provoked great excitement on both sides of the Atlantic. Having made their eponymous first album, which included such classics as Stills\u2019s \u201cSuite: Judy Blue Eyes\u201d, Nash\u2019s \u201cMarrakesh Express\u201d and Crosby\u2019s \u201cGuinnevere\u201d, they added Young in time for their first concerts, with appearances at both Woodstock and Altamont before they made their European debut at the Royal Albert Hall in January 1970, at which they were unsettled by the reserved response of the British audience. With Young, they had already recorded a second album, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu, whose highlights included Nash\u2019s terminally twee \u201cOur House\u201d, about his relationship with Mitchell; Crosby\u2019s \u201cAlmost Cut My Hair\u201d, a response to the shooting of Bobby Kennedy and the recent death of a girlfriend; and \u2013 sticking out a mile \u2013 the new recruit\u2019s plaintive \u201cHelpless\u201d. But Stills was already telling a British journalist: \u201cIt started out as a really beautiful idea. We were full of enthusiasm and ideals. Now a lot of that feeling has gone between us.\u201d Thereafter, in Doggett\u2019s words, it becomes \u201cthe tale of how four individuals battled to maintain their separate artistic identities when much of their audience simply wanted them to repeat the past\u201d. Neither book flinches from dealing with the way, to put it simply, the peace and harmony given by marijuana were taken away by the paranoia of cocaine. From their descriptions of the protagonists\u2019 relations with battalions of compliant young women, the hero is undoubtedly Mitchell, who emerged from relationships with Crosby and Nash as an independent figure, using what she had learnt as material for her own songs, which have generally worn rather better than theirs. Of the two authors, Browne is the more likely to produce sentences such as: \u201cBetween snorts of cocaine, the trio rounded up a few other musicians \u2026\u201d He seems not to know what \u201cunison\u201d means, which is odd for a man writing a book about one of the world\u2019s most famous vocal harmony groups, and has a regrettable fondness for telling us that people \u201creached out\u201d to each other.

      "bodyText": "The commonwealth ombudsman has refused to investigate a complaint from a home affairs employee about the Australian federal police\u2019s handling of raids on their home and workplace over leaks related to the au pairs saga involving Peter Dutton. In October 2018 the AFP raided a home affairs employee\u2019s home and the Canberra office of the department over leaks concerning Dutton\u2019s ministerial intervention in the case of two foreign au pairs. A freedom of information request revealed that Dutton\u2019s chief of staff, Craig Maclachlan, was alerted to the fact the raids were going to take place the day before by the deputy commissioner, Neil Gaughan. That revelation sparked a formal complaint from the public servant to the Australian federal police in January, Nine newspapers first reported. The public servant said that the text message showed there were \u201creasonable grounds to suspect the AFP is neither operationally independent or without political bias\u201d. The AFP has argued that it was within its guidelines on politically sensitive investigations to alert the minister\u2019s office before the raids took place. Guardian Australia can reveal that complaint was rejected by the AFP later in January, stating that the evidence the AFP provided to the Senate was sufficient. The public servant then made a complaint to the commonwealth ombudsman. They requested the ombudsman to review the adequacy of the guidelines on politically sensitive investigations and the AFP\u2019s compliance with the guidelines. \u201cHad the AFP followed its national guidelines, exercised due diligence and not engaged in politically biased activity, the warrant activity on myself should never have occurred,\u201d they said. Late last month, the commonwealth ombudsman investigator Kent Purvis responded in a letter seen by Guardian Australia, stating that given the matter was being looked at by the Senate privileges committee, it would be a duplication of work. \u201cGiven this past and currently ongoing consideration and scrutiny by the Senate, I assess that a further investigation conducted by this office of the matters you raise would be a duplication of this work,\u201d Purvis said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning A spokesperson for the ombudsman confirmed the contents of the letter. \u201cWe determined that the Senate standing committee of privileges had issued a report which addressed the substance of the complaint. In a related development, the full Senate passed a resolution calling on the attorney general to work with the presiding officers to develop a new protocol for the execution of search warrants. \u201cFor these reasons, we determined no further investigation by our office was warranted.\u201d The Senate committee found in April that the national guideline needs to be amended, and requested the attorney general work with the presiding officers of the parliament to develop a new protocol for the execution of search warrants. Guardian Australia understands the public servant is still employed within home affairs. Dutton\u2019s office was not alerted before raids on the ABC and News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst last month, and the incoming AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw said on Wednesday the minister\u2019s office would not be informed of raids before they took place unless a national security concern required the minister to be alerted.",

      "body": "<p>It is said that Netflix cancels shows after two or three seasons for a couple of reasons. First, it\u2019s unlikely that more of the same thing will draw new subscribers to the platform; and second, the company produces content on a deal that sees producers get paid exponentially more when their show is recommissioned more than twice.</p> <p>The fourth season of Last Chance U dropped last week. And whatever Netflix paid to make it, it was worth every penny. This is, by far, the best Last Chance U has ever been.</p> <p>If you\u2019re not the sort of person who usually enters lightly into documentaries about American sports \u2013 like me \u2013 here\u2019s a quick catchup. Last Chance U follows the American football teams of community colleges; institutions that have made their name by taking players nobody else wants. The players are all extraordinarily talented, but they come from severely disadvantaged backgrounds and often struggle academically. They\u2019ve been raised to be selfish and butt up against authority, so to achieve their dreams of playing professional football they have to learn to work towards a common goal and improve as people. It\u2019s heady, heartrending stuff.</p> <p>There are two types of Last Chance U season. There\u2019s the season where the team wins in spite of their personal issues, and the season where everything goes wrong because of them. This new season is the latter, and you won\u2019t see a better drama all summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b4abb524722d167800f2e51e80e06a072937c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22b4abb524722d167800f2e51e80e06a072937c9/120_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last Chance U season 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mosaic of destiny ... Last Chance U.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To recap: in season three, Independence Community College hired showboating firebrand head coach Jason Brown to shore up its failing football program. A divisive \u2013 some would say unapologetically horrible \u2013 figure, Brown screamed and flailed at his team of talented outsiders until they were able to reach their full potential. The result was their most successful league result in years.</p> <p>The afterglow of this success continues into season four. Buoyed by victory, Brown spends $600,000 on a new training pitch and idles away his time basking in the trappings of fame. He finds validation in gifts and supportive tweets and celebrity videos. He has finally become the big man he\u2019s always wanted to be. The first match ends in an easy victory. The team looks unstoppable. But then they lose the next match, and the match after that, and everything begins to crater.</p> <p>The team\u2019s linchpin Bobby Bruce \u2013 a sweet, troubled figure prone to self-sabotage \u2013 inserts himself into a stupid situation and has to leave. A talented player is undermined by a returning hero. A young boy prone to injury hurts himself in increasingly serious ways. The team parties last longer and are more self-destructive. Coaches see their private lives deteriorate. The town slowly turns against its team. The players neglect their hard-won bond to concentrate on their own careers. They fight their opponents. They fight each other. By episode six \u2013 the emotional nadir of the entire series \u2013 you\u2019re basically watching decay happen in real time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7c5302c0347fb794905423dfa9439aaed2daf08b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c5302c0347fb794905423dfa9439aaed2daf08b/240_0_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Last Chance U season 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magic ... Last Chance U.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This whole season is an examination of failure. Before, the players and coaches could justify their awful behaviour by pointing to the victories they wrought. But without that to hide behind, what\u2019s left is simply a collection of bad people. Last year, because his actions brought success to the town, people hailed Coach Brown as a hero. This time, because they didn\u2019t, those same actions are labelled as emotional abuse. It\u2019s fascinating.</p> <p>As ever, the match sequences underline all this tension. They are a thing of absolute beauty, cut together to make every stroke of misfortune look inevitable. The players never set out to lose, but every snarl of frustration, every sunken shoulder, every embittered Coach Brown headslap caught on camera, swirls together to create a mosaic of destiny. And it isn\u2019t that at all \u2013 it\u2019s just a football match \u2013 but the Last Chance U team makes it look like a magic trick.</p> <p>Nobody \u2013 not even the producers \u2013 know what\u2019s next for Last Chance U. It seems unlikely that the crew will return to Independence, thanks to a last-minute twist that throws the team into even more disarray. But I\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken if there isn\u2019t a series five. It is hands down one of the best things on television.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is said that Netflix cancels shows after two or three seasons for a couple of reasons. First, it\u2019s unlikely that more of the same thing will draw new subscribers to the platform; and second, the company produces content on a deal that sees producers get paid exponentially more when their show is recommissioned more than twice. The fourth season of Last Chance U dropped last week. And whatever Netflix paid to make it, it was worth every penny. This is, by far, the best Last Chance U has ever been. If you\u2019re not the sort of person who usually enters lightly into documentaries about American sports \u2013 like me \u2013 here\u2019s a quick catchup. Last Chance U follows the American football teams of community colleges; institutions that have made their name by taking players nobody else wants. The players are all extraordinarily talented, but they come from severely disadvantaged backgrounds and often struggle academically. They\u2019ve been raised to be selfish and butt up against authority, so to achieve their dreams of playing professional football they have to learn to work towards a common goal and improve as people. It\u2019s heady, heartrending stuff. There are two types of Last Chance U season. There\u2019s the season where the team wins in spite of their personal issues, and the season where everything goes wrong because of them. This new season is the latter, and you won\u2019t see a better drama all summer. To recap: in season three, Independence Community College hired showboating firebrand head coach Jason Brown to shore up its failing football program. A divisive \u2013 some would say unapologetically horrible \u2013 figure, Brown screamed and flailed at his team of talented outsiders until they were able to reach their full potential. The result was their most successful league result in years. The afterglow of this success continues into season four. Buoyed by victory, Brown spends $600,000 on a new training pitch and idles away his time basking in the trappings of fame. He finds validation in gifts and supportive tweets and celebrity videos. He has finally become the big man he\u2019s always wanted to be. The first match ends in an easy victory. The team looks unstoppable. But then they lose the next match, and the match after that, and everything begins to crater. The team\u2019s linchpin Bobby Bruce \u2013 a sweet, troubled figure prone to self-sabotage \u2013 inserts himself into a stupid situation and has to leave. A talented player is undermined by a returning hero. A young boy prone to injury hurts himself in increasingly serious ways. The team parties last longer and are more self-destructive. Coaches see their private lives deteriorate. The town slowly turns against its team. The players neglect their hard-won bond to concentrate on their own careers. They fight their opponents. They fight each other. By episode six \u2013 the emotional nadir of the entire series \u2013 you\u2019re basically watching decay happen in real time. This whole season is an examination of failure. Before, the players and coaches could justify their awful behaviour by pointing to the victories they wrought. But without that to hide behind, what\u2019s left is simply a collection of bad people. Last year, because his actions brought success to the town, people hailed Coach Brown as a hero. This time, because they didn\u2019t, those same actions are labelled as emotional abuse. It\u2019s fascinating. As ever, the match sequences underline all this tension. They are a thing of absolute beauty, cut together to make every stroke of misfortune look inevitable. The players never set out to lose, but every snarl of frustration, every sunken shoulder, every embittered Coach Brown headslap caught on camera, swirls together to create a mosaic of destiny. And it isn\u2019t that at all \u2013 it\u2019s just a football match \u2013 but the Last Chance U team makes it look like a magic trick. Nobody \u2013 not even the producers \u2013 know what\u2019s next for Last Chance U. It seems unlikely that the crew will return to Independence, thanks to a last-minute twist that throws the team into even more disarray. But I\u2019ll be absolutely heartbroken if there isn\u2019t a series five. It is hands down one of the best things on television.",

Earlier this year, the state passed a \u201ctruth in labelling\u201d law, <a href=\"http://www.arkleg.state.ar.us/assembly/2019/2019R/Bills/HB1407.pdf\">Arkansas Act 501</a>, to \u201cprotect consumers from being misled or confused by false or misleading labeling of agricultural products that are edible by humans.\u201d The main targets of this legislation are plant-based products; these will no longer be allowed to describe themselves as \u201cburgers,\u201d \u201csausage,\u201d \u201cmilk\u201d etc. Under the new law, each individual package incorrectly labelled as meat would be hit with a fine of up to $1,000.</p> <p>Act 501 is scheduled to go into effect this week. On Monday, however, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Tofurky company filed a civil rights <a href=\"https://www.gfi.org/files/policy/arkansas-tofurky-complaint.pdf\">complaint</a> arguing that the legislation is unconstitutional. It\u2019s unclear whether a judge will suspend the law pending resolution of this complaint.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see why Tofurky is upset about the law, but what\u2019s the ACLU\u2019s beef? Well, they\u2019re worried because it threatens free speech. The lawsuit argues that it constitutes a \u201crestriction on commercial speech. It does nothing to protect the public from potentially misleading information. Instead, it creates consumer confusion where none existed before in order to impede competition.\u201d</p> <p>As the Tofurky/ACLU complaint points out, the Arkansas law is clearly designed to protect the meat industry rather than consumers. After all, your brain would have to be made out of tofu to look at a veggie burger\u2019s packaging and mistake it for something made out of animal. The clue is words like \u201cveggie\u201d, \u201cplant-based\u201d and \u201cmeatless\u201d. As Brian Krauss, an ACLU attorney, said in a statement: \u201cIt\u2019s absurdly patronizing that the government of Arkansas is asserting that the people of Arkansas can\u2019t tell a veggie burger from a hamburger, or a tofu dog from a hot dog.\u201d</p> <p>Plant-based \u201cmeat\u201d alternatives like the Impossible Burger have rocketed in popularity over the last few years. Veggie burgers used to be somewhat niche, but the new breed of meatless burgers have aggressively been targeting meat-eaters and the animal product industry clearly feels threatened. The rise in popularity of non-dairy milk also has the dairy industry running scared; according to <a href=\"https://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/us-non-dairy-milk-sales-grow-61-over-the-last-five-years\">a recent report by Mintel</a> sales of plant-based milk grew over 60% between 2012 and 2017. Dairy milk sales dropped 15% during that same period. The response to consumers\u2019 changing tastes has been a flurry of protectionist legislation. Mississippi and Missouri, for example, recently passed laws similar to Act 501; the legality of these has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-02/vegan-meat-makers-sue-mississippi-over-what-to-call-it\">also been challenged</a>. The Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicksibilla/2019/01/31/fda-crackdown-on-calling-almond-milk-milk-could-violate-the-first-amendment/#1f5d1b17b70a\">is also currently considering</a> whether plant-based products should be allowed to use terms like \u201cmilk\u201d and \u201ccheese\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just the meat and dairy industry that is worried about the rise of plant-based products, by the way. Arkansas is the biggest producer of rice in the United States and, surprise surprise, Act 501 <a href=\"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/mar/20/truth-in-labeling-inked-by-governor-201/\">is the only legislation</a> of its type so far to include protections for rice. The Arkansas Rice Federation worked with the Arkansas Cattlemen\u2019s Association and other interest groups on Act 501, according to Arkansas Online, and the state law means \u201ccauliflower rice\u201d would be considered mislabeled. (I mean, to be fair, they may have a point there \u2013 that stuff is a crime against humanity.)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The flurry of protectionist legislation is a reminder that America\u2019s much-vaunted free market economy isn\u2019t really free</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The flurry of protectionist legislation attempting to regulate plant-based products is a reminder that America\u2019s much-vaunted free market economy isn\u2019t really free. Instead of purely being driven by supply and demand, it\u2019s manipulated by powerful corporations and industries. In his book Meatonomics, for example, David Robinson Simon argues that meat consumption has grown because of government subsidies and regulation that lets the industry keep prices artificially low. In a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/07/meatonomics-david-robinson-simon-everything-i-envision-for-meat-has-happened-with-tobacco\">2017 interview with the Guardian</a> he notes that \u201cif the industry were forced to cover its total costs, instead of imposing them on taxpayers, animals and the environment, a $4 Big Mac would cost about $11.\u201d Speaking over email, Simon adds: \u201cThe animal agriculture industry is one of the most powerful special interests in the US, with a lobbying presence in every statehouse in the country and an enormous budget to influence laws and lawmakers everywhere. At the federal level this lobby spends more than $140m yearly and is routinely cited as one of the reasons why federal agricultural reform legislation almost never makes it out of committee.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s too soon to know what will happen with Act 501; however it\u2019s safe to say this won\u2019t be the last attempt at legislating the life out of the booming plant-based food industry. Anyway, as we wait to see what happens, please do be careful with food labels. I\u2019d hate for you to consume a canine-free \u201chot dog\u201d or eat a hamburger and realize it didn\u2019t contain any ham. Or, god forbid, chow down on a meat-free veggie burger.</p>",

It\u2019s not just the meat and dairy industry that is worried about the rise of plant-based products, by the way. Arkansas is the biggest producer of rice in the United States and, surprise surprise, Act 501 is the only legislation of its type so far to include protections for rice. The Arkansas Rice Federation worked with the Arkansas Cattlemen\u2019s Association and other interest groups on Act 501, according to Arkansas Online, and the state law means \u201ccauliflower rice\u201d would be considered mislabeled. (I mean, to be fair, they may have a point there \u2013 that stuff is a crime against humanity.) The flurry of protectionist legislation attempting to regulate plant-based products is a reminder that America\u2019s much-vaunted free market economy isn\u2019t really free. Instead of purely being driven by supply and demand, it\u2019s manipulated by powerful corporations and industries. In his book Meatonomics, for example, David Robinson Simon argues that meat consumption has grown because of government subsidies and regulation that lets the industry keep prices artificially low. In a 2017 interview with the Guardian he notes that \u201cif the industry were forced to cover its total costs, instead of imposing them on taxpayers, animals and the environment, a $4 Big Mac would cost about $11.\u201d Speaking over email, Simon adds: \u201cThe animal agriculture industry is one of the most powerful special interests in the US, with a lobbying presence in every statehouse in the country and an enormous budget to influence laws and lawmakers everywhere. At the federal level this lobby spends more than $140m yearly and is routinely cited as one of the reasons why federal agricultural reform legislation almost never makes it out of committee.\u201d It\u2019s too soon to know what will happen with Act 501; however it\u2019s safe to say this won\u2019t be the last attempt at legislating the life out of the booming plant-based food industry. Anyway, as we wait to see what happens, please do be careful with food labels. I\u2019d hate for you to consume a canine-free \u201chot dog\u201d or eat a hamburger and realize it didn\u2019t contain any ham. Or, god forbid, chow down on a meat-free veggie burger.",

      "bodyText": "The lunchtime smokers of North Sydney gathered under a cloud this week after their local council became the first in Australia to vote to ban smoking in all public places within its CBD. Speaking after the decision the local mayor, Jilly Gibson, said the move was long overdue. \u201cI believe it is the time of the non-smoker,\u201d she declared. The ban doesn\u2019t come into force for a few months and Guardian Australia managed to find a few smokers furtively lighting up in the doorways of fire escapes, or hidden in the shadow of alcoves. A large group of them took refuge in an alleyway behind an Aldi supermarket; in these troubled times, there is safety in numbers. \u201cWe were just talking about it,\u201d Terry Lee, a vaper, says when I ask him if he\u2019s heard the news. \u201cWe\u2019re sad mate, we\u2019re sad,\u201d his colleague Bosco Dcosta tells me. Word of the ban hadn\u2019t quite reached everyone, however. Nacho Malo, a Spaniard, is shocked when I break the bad news while he rolls a Tally-Ho. \u201cYou are saying I cannot smoke here?\u201d Well, not me, the council. And not just here (a nook in a wall behind a large, nondescript building near a train station) but anywhere in a radius of several blocks. \u201cWe need some place to smoke, no?\u201d he asks me plaintively, gesturing at the cigarette in my own hand. I explain the situation to Malo like this: using roughly the same authority that allows a council to create no-parking zones and leash-only dog parks, on Monday night North Sydney council passed a unanimous motion to ban smoking throughout public places in the entire CBD. The ban includes parks, footpaths, benches; any public place. There will be a three-month awareness campaign and people won\u2019t be fined until a council review next March to see whether the self-regulated ban is working. Gibson tells me she\u2019s been overwhelmed by the positive reaction to the decision. Councils as far away as Burnie in Tasmania have contacted her to ask for help instituting their own ban. \u201cI think as a society we should be denormalising smoking,\u201d she says. \u201cSociety changes. I think back to when I was a schoolgirl, my teacher used to chain-smoke and leave his cigarette on my desk in front of me. That just sounds absolutely ridiculous now. \u201cI think limiting the exposure of young people to a smoking environment is a really positive thing to do and I think the time will come reasonably soon where smoking wont be allowed at all in public. That\u2019s my hope.\u201d Malo is not convinced. \u201cI think it is a little bit silly, no? If I am smoking here (he waves his hand around the nook), I am not bothering anyone. If there is a woman with her children here I am not going to blow smoke in her face. So it is my responsibility.\u201d The wider population, at least in North Sydney, disagrees.

Crossed by the stunning green waters of the Trebbia river, it is dotted with castles, hamlets and minor Roman ruins (Hannibal faced the Romans here with his elephants). The monastery of Bobbio, founded by the Irish monk Columbanus, a great medieval cultural hot spots, is the crown jewel. You can swim, kayak, hike and cycle, then stop for lovely Gutturnio wine, fresh porcini mushrooms, Ligurian focaccia and <em>culatello</em> (like prosciutto but better). The Trebbia river meets the Po near Piacenza, which is a good base from which to explore the region.<br><strong>Lara Fiorani</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Sperlonga</strong>, Italy</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3bbbf563cc74b66c78afa1df305a56c401a9b421\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3bbbf563cc74b66c78afa1df305a56c401a9b421/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"View from the castle, Sperlonga\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View from the castle, Sperlonga.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Last year I was travelling by train from Rome to Naples when a strike left me stuck at the little station of Formia.

It\u2019s a lovely town of winding, hilly streets with white stone houses, largely free of international tourists, full of gelato bars and pizzerias. Its soft sandy beach has great sunsets with views of 541-metre Monte Circeo with its caves, such as Grotta delle Capre, where goats have sheltered since antiquity. I was told Roman emperors used to come here for their summer breaks \u2013 since then it seems to have gone undetected.<br><strong>Alex Hughes</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9a19fac5-8dff-4125-9ba7-ba08f2c09fa7\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p><strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Every week we ask our readers for recommendations from their travels.

The town is a bustling \u2013 but not with tourists \u2013 lake resort; I don\u2019t think we bumped into anyone from western Europe let alone the UK. It offers great value and beautiful scenery, especially for walking or cycling, but the jewel is the crystal-clear lake. There is great swimming, fishing and water sports, and you never feel crammed in.

      "bodyText": "Winning tip: Val Trebbia, Italy Val Trebbia is a quiet corner of Italy that Ernest Hemingway called \u201cthe most beautiful valley in the world\u201d. Crossed by the stunning green waters of the Trebbia river, it is dotted with castles, hamlets and minor Roman ruins (Hannibal faced the Romans here with his elephants). The monastery of Bobbio, founded by the Irish monk Columbanus, a great medieval cultural hot spots, is the crown jewel. You can swim, kayak, hike and cycle, then stop for lovely Gutturnio wine, fresh porcini mushrooms, Ligurian focaccia and culatello (like prosciutto but better). The Trebbia river meets the Po near Piacenza, which is a good base from which to explore the region. Lara Fiorani Sperlonga, Italy Last year I was travelling by train from Rome to Naples when a strike left me stuck at the little station of Formia. The panini seller on the platform drove me to his brother\u2019s little pensione in Sperlonga 20 minutes away, and I stayed there for a week. It\u2019s a lovely town of winding, hilly streets with white stone houses, largely free of international tourists, full of gelato bars and pizzerias. Its soft sandy beach has great sunsets with views of 541-metre Monte Circeo with its caves, such as Grotta delle Capre, where goats have sheltered since antiquity. I was told Roman emperors used to come here for their summer breaks \u2013 since then it seems to have gone undetected. Alex Hughes Berat, Albania Berat is known as the city of a thousand windows for its beautiful hillside filled with pretty Ottoman cottages. There\u2019s also a castle to explore with views over the whole valley. After dark, cosy tavernas welcome patrons with hearty Balkan fare and potent grappa. Living is cheap, with loads of affordable places to eat and drink and you can get a double room in the cute Hostel Maya Berat for only \u20ac24. Either fly to Corfu, get the ferry over and combine it with some beach time or head to Tirana and make your way down from the capital, a 90-minute drive away. Tim Alderson Ohrid, North Macedonia Ohrid is a town that clings on to the edge of the beautiful Lake Ohrid. We travelled there by car from Albania so it really felt like a journey into the unknown. The town is a bustling \u2013 but not with tourists \u2013 lake resort; I don\u2019t think we bumped into anyone from western Europe let alone the UK. It offers great value and beautiful scenery, especially for walking or cycling, but the jewel is the crystal-clear lake. There is great swimming, fishing and water sports, and you never feel crammed in. Surprisingly the nightlife has something for everyone, from superb restaurants to bars and a rather-dated funfair. Darryl Laroles, Alpujarra mountains, Spain An hour and a half\u2019s drive from both the historic city of Granada and the unspoilt beaches of Cabo de Gata in Almeria, and nestled high in the stunning Alpujarras, the white-washed village of Laroles, and the cluster of villages around it, offer a rare glimpse of life in a rural Spanish community. Step back in time among olive groves and almond trees and enjoy the local wine and honey. This is old men on donkeys territory. Laroles is also home to the vibrant and award-winning Me Vuelves Lorca theatre festival (this year 2-11 August), which is held every summer in a beautiful, Greek-style open-air theatre that was handcrafted by the local community in 2013. Concerts under the stars ... truly magical! Helen Rogers Lapa dos Dinheiros, Portugal In the Serra da Estrela, we stayed in the tiny village of Valezim and walked through pine forests and clouds of butterflies to Lapa dos Dinheiros, where there is a river beach above a dam with large boulders \u2013 and, crucially, a very quiet bar selling eye-wateringly strong caipirinhas. Felix Macpherson Arcadia, Greece In the heart of Greece\u2019s jellyfish-shaped south-west lies the stunning region of Arcadia. For an area so far south, it is surprisingly lush and green, with clear mountain rivers slicing through steep gorges. After a couple of hours\u2019 driving through twisty mountain roads, pausing only to let tortoises cross the road, we arrived in pretty Stemnitsa village. A 20-minute walk down a stony path led us to the Monastery of Prodromou. Cut into the sides of the Loussios gorge and home to seven monks who welcomed us in for bitter Greek coffee, its small rock chapel and meditative views left us inspired. Such a special, untouched place. Susie Lee-Kilgariff Zeeland, The Netherlands The Dutch coast features long sandy beaches backed by vast dunes.

Patel was forced to resign from government two years ago for holding secret, unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, businesspeople and a senior lobbyist. \u201cThe result,\u201d writes Jonathan Freedland, \u201cis a top table that is startlingly right wing.

It was previously thought dramatic swings occurred in such periods as the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d and \u201cMedieval Climate Anomaly\u201d. But analysis of 700 proxy records of temperature change \u2013 such as trees, ice and sediment \u2013 indicate none of these affected more than half the globe at any one time. \u201cThis paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle,\u201d said Mark Maslin from University College London. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have just recorded their highest ever temperatures and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/24/summers-second-heatwave-set-to-break-records-across-europe\">climate crisis is being blamed</a>.</p> \n<p>Looking at YouTube, though, you might not believe anything was awry with the climate \u2013 a researcher has found most of the videos on the subject tend towards the side of discredited and denialist theories.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018He\u2019s got Vote Leave back together\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here with some things that bear thinking about. Boris Johnson\u2019s new government could struggle to survive after 17 senior ministers were sacked or resigned from government in what has been dubbed the \u201csummer\u2019s day massacre\u201d. Four former cabinet ministers led by the ex-chancellor Philip Hammond have indicated that they are determined to block a no-deal Brexit after resigning on Wednesday before they could be sacked. Johnson sacked 13 others, including Brexiters, who had backed his leadership rival Jeremy Hunt. He appointed in their place a roster of leavers and rightwing free-marketers. \u201cHe has effectively got Vote Leave back together,\u201d one Johnson-backing MP said. Priti Patel\u2019s appointment as home secretary has been met with an outpouring of concern over her hard-right record on key issues covered by her new brief. Patel was forced to resign from government two years ago for holding secret, unofficial meetings with Israeli ministers, businesspeople and a senior lobbyist. \u201cThe result,\u201d writes Jonathan Freedland, \u201cis a top table that is startlingly right wing. Dominic Raab as foreign secretary, along with the pro-death penalty Priti Patel at the Home Office, puts two people once considered on the wilder Tory fringes at the heart of government \u2013 not to mention Jacob Rees-Mogg attending cabinet as leader of the House.\u201d Internationally, the reaction to Johnson\u2019s elevation has been mixed: the Washington Post notes his \u201cfrequent false statements\u201d, the French newspaper Liberation calls him \u201cextravagant and disturbing\u201d, while pragmatic Australia is eager to strike a trade deal. * * * And now, the weather \u2013 Temperatures in southern and eastern England have a 70% chance of reaching an unprecedented 39C today. Commuters have been asked to avoid rail travel as trains are being slowed to reduce the chance of rails buckling in the heat. Bodies of two bathers have been recovered from the river Thames with one still missing. Turning to the bigger picture: in a groundbreaking report, researchers say there has never been a period in the last 2,000 years when temperature changes have been as fast and extensive as in recent decades, and the scientific consensus that humans are causing global heating is likely to have passed 99%. It was previously thought dramatic swings occurred in such periods as the \u201cLittle Ice Age\u201d and \u201cMedieval Climate Anomaly\u201d. But analysis of 700 proxy records of temperature change \u2013 such as trees, ice and sediment \u2013 indicate none of these affected more than half the globe at any one time. \u201cThis paper should finally stop climate change deniers claiming that the recent observed coherent global warming is part of a natural climate cycle,\u201d said Mark Maslin from University College London. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands have just recorded their highest ever temperatures and the climate crisis is being blamed. Looking at YouTube, though, you might not believe anything was awry with the climate \u2013 a researcher has found most of the videos on the subject tend towards the side of discredited and denialist theories. Dr Joachim Allgaier of RWTH Aachen University says YouTube should \u201cchange their algorithms to prioritise factual information\u201d while scientists should be putting more factual videos on the platform. * * * Trump not cleared, Russia still meddling \u2013 Robert Mueller, the Trump-Russia investigator, has insisted in testimony to Congress that he did not exonerate the president. His much-vaunted appearance lacked the killing stroke Democrats had hoped for, but Mueller did say that if Trump was not in office he could be charged with obstructing justice; while Russia\u2019s election meddling was \u201csweeping and systematic \u2026 They\u2019re doing it as we sit here.\u201d * * * Thursday catch-up \u2013 A little extra catch-up can\u2019t hurt \u2026 &gt; North Korea has fired two short-range missiles into the sea, South Korea\u2019s military says, after warnings from Pyongyang over military exercises between Washington and Seoul next month. &gt; The Puerto Rico governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, has bowed to pressure and announced his resignation overnight after weeks of protests over leaked text messages where he took part in homophobic and sexist jokes. &gt; Production of the 737 Max might have to be halted, Boeing has warned, as the airliner remains grounded by regulators. Two crashes that killed hundreds of people were linked to a design fault. Boeing has continued to build the planes in anticipation of its rectifications being cleared by authorities. &gt; More than \u00a31bn of food is being thrown away or fed to animals before it leaves UK farms every year. The 3.6m tonnes wasted in primary production is more than 10 times the amount thrown away by retailers, says Wrap, the waste-reduction body. &gt; In Hong Kong, the Yuen Long district is fighting back after masked gangsters \u2013 suspected to be triads in league with authorities \u2013 brutally attacked people at a train station including pro-democracy protesters. Parts of the station have been covered with photos of victims and attackers, along with signs saying \u201cTake Back Yuen Long\u201d. * * * Death of a soldier \u2013 This extraordinary photograph provides a rare and poignant look back in time to the Korean war: the remains of a soldier, lying as he fell in what is now the demilitarised zone (DMZ) dividing the north and south. \u201cYou can see that this soldier was killed by a bullet wound to the head,\u201d said Park Jongwoo, the photographer. \u201cBut apart from that, we knew nothing about him.\u201d Park took the picture in 2012 after becoming the first civilian photographer allowed in. He documented the work of Makri, the South Korean government agency tasked with recovering and identifying war remains. \u201cLike this photo, many war remains are found with rifles and bullet clips, and the bodies lie in the exact position they fell, preserved in the mud, as if they are frozen in time.\u201d Today in Focus podcast: Can Corbyn take on Boris Johnson? Listen to Heather Stewart on Labour\u2019s attempts to reunite around its Brexit policy, plus Sonia Sodha on Boris Johnson\u2019s first speech as prime minister. Lunchtime read: How the state runs business in China When US officials were pressed in early 2019 to provide evidence that Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, had facilitated spying on the US and its allies, they pointed out that Beijing had already made their case for them: first with the party\u2019s systematic infiltration of private companies, and second with the introduction of a new national intelligence law in 2017.

Meanwhile pressure from party committees to have a seat at the table when executives are making big calls on investment and the like means the \u201clines have been dangerously blurred\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Broke 9pm, BBC Two Nick Leader\u2019s three-part documentary follows families over a year in which their financial futures hang in the balance. It opens with the stories of Steve and Billy, a father and son from Hastings, who lost their jobs and their home and wound up in tents on the beach. Then there is struggling steelworker Ross from Port Talbot, his partner Vicky and their three kids, and photographer-turned-Uber driver Mark from London. This gallery of poignant TV portraits proves \u201cbeing broke is not the same as being broken\u201d. Mike Bradley Ross Kemp Living With Homelessness 7.30pm, ITV More accustomed to embedding himself in foreign hotspots, Kemp ventures closer to home with this series on issues affecting the UK. He begins by joining rough sleepers in Cardiff on its coldest night in seven years. Despite his gruff exterior, Kemp proves a sympathetic witness to a genuine crisis. Gwilym Mumford Catch-22 9pm, Channel 4 This superb dramatisation of Joseph Heller\u2019s tricky novel can\u2019t quite magic up a neat ending but, before then, the final episode is another killer. Yossarian injures his scrotum hilariously, but then the show\u2019s jazzy black farce makes way for a gut-punch scene about the real bloody hell of war. Jack Seale Portillo: The Trouble With the Tories 9pm, Channel 5 The Conservative party was a power-amassing machine for decades, then Brexit ruined it. That is the Portillo presumption, anyway. This postmortem includes interviews with fellow \u201cbig beasts\u201d, but doesn\u2019t feature anyone under 45, commenters of colour or any single women. Another clue, perhaps? Ellen E Jones Inside the Bruderhof 10.35pm, BBC One This film about a radical community hidden away in a rural Sussex village, where residents have relinquished money and possessions to live as disciples of Jesus, paints a picture disquieting enough to arouse your curiosity. Overall, though, it is a bit toothless and could have done with an injection of Louis Theroux. MB The Tez O\u2019Clock Show 11pm, Channel 4 Channel 4 continues to do good work in diversifying topical TV satire: now, northern, working-class Muslim Tez Ilyas has a three-week run of sketches, chat and interviews that his sharp standup suggests will be on the money. Fellow comedians Sophie Willan, Adam Rowe, Sindhu Vee and Man Like Mobeen\u2019s Guz Khan co-star. JS Film choice August: Osage County (John Wells, 2013), 1.50am, Channel 4 An A-list ensemble gathers at the home of Meryl Streep\u2019s newly widowed matriarch Violet Weston for this engrossing screening of Tracy Letts\u2019s play \u2013 and director John Wells lets them get on with it. Among those chewing over the ripe dialogue, Julia Roberts excels as daughter Barbara, terrified of ending up like Mum.

Solarcentury, one of the UK\u2019s fastest growing renewable energy companies, will report profits of \u00a314.4m for the year ending in March, compared with \u00a31.5m the year before. A 5% share of the record profits will be channelled into SolarAid, a charity that has helped connect 2m homes in Africa to reliable electricity since it was founded by Solarcentury in 2006. The rapidly rising profits follow a four-year growth strategy in which the company has invested heavily in building and running subsidy-free solar projects in southern Europe, Latin America and Africa. In the year ahead the UK will emerge as a key focus for subsidy-free projects, owing to falling technology costs that have made solar power more economical in more overcast countries. The better than expected results are likely to stoke investor interest in the company, which was put up for sale this year and could fetch \u00a3250m for its current owners. But the sale could spell the end of the donations to SolarAid as the new owners will not be held to the same agreement. Solarcentury hands a share of its net profit to the charity every year to fund a not-for-profit home-solar company that sells mini solar panels to homes in Uganda, Malawi and Zambia on a pay-as-you-go basis. The company\u2019s record profits mean SolarAid will receive more than \u00a3500,000 from Solarcentury, which could fund 125,000 new home-solar installations.

      "body": "<p>Every second Monday of the month, a small group of volunteers meets in the training room of a Birmingham supermarket. They discuss what has long seemed to many of their friends a crazy and probably doomed idea: how to excavate a contaminated 40-year-old waste dump, create an urban marina, restore three miles of derelict canal and build several new bridges and locks.</p> \n<p>Last month, however, the meeting of the 18-strong Lapal Canal Trust committee was joyous. After 20 years of trying to restore this short stretch of the 200-year-old Dudley No 2 canal, permission had finally been granted, they were told. </p> \n<p>What\u2019s more, a feasibility study showed that the plan \u2013 which would link the suburbs of California and Selly Oak by water \u2013 could be a catalyst for nothing short of the economic and ecological renaissance of a large area of south Birmingham.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"685fa274e6803dd4513757b065e9f4d467b1be23\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/685fa274e6803dd4513757b065e9f4d467b1be23/58_0_766_766/500.jpg\" alt=\"How the Greenway looks now\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"8db2aa96b03a575403e3c406694dff1bfbbc38be\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8db2aa96b03a575403e3c406694dff1bfbbc38be/530_170_1239_1239/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of the transformation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The Lapal Canal Trust has ambitious plans to convert the Greenway into a working canal.

The marina for 60-100 boats will stimulate businesses and bring in tourists. The wildlife corridor created along the canal will attract herons, otters, fish and waterfowl. And although the whole project will cost about \u00a35m, the study said it would pay for itself in six years.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt will improve life in the city. It will complete an old canal loop around the city \u2013 we owe it to the future to restore it. We have support from business, the community, the university, developers and everyone. No one is objecting and we have nearly raised the first \u00a3250,000 \u2013 enough to start work,\u201d says the Lapal trust CEO, Hugh Humphreys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cdfb7916-2bf5-4323-a87c-eba878c7cc82\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Few things symbolise the way our cities have transformed more than canals. Around the world, cities have woken up to the power of their urban waterways: from Milan to Manchester, the former economic arteries of industry are being turned into corridors for walkers, boaters and wildlife. Cafes and restaurants are proliferating and canalside living is newly chic \u2013 and newly costly.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>As commercial interests muscle in on the last great undeveloped bit of Britain\u2019s cities, Guardian Cities and the Observer wanted to take stock of a crucial moment in history, when we still have a choice: whether to turn canals into sanitised enclaves of wealth, or preserve them as a precious resource for all.</p>\n    <p><b>Chris Michael, Cities editor</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Lapal plan is one of at least 80 canal renaissance projects currently making British towns and cities suitable for populations seeking tranquility, leisure space and new ways to move around. Just as canal-building drove urban growth in the 18th and 19th centuries by linking urban areas and stimulating trade, a new mania for canal developments is today reshaping cities by offering oases of calm in fastest-moving town centres.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The restoration of the canals in the 1950s and 60s was thanks to a remarkable act of defiance by unpaid volunteers</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mike Clarke, historian</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s not just happening in Britain. Canal restoration, building and development is now a global phenomenon, with billions of dollars spent on projects annually around the world. From Paris to Milan, waterside developments can command 20% premium prices, and many cities with extensive canal networks, such as Bruges, Ghent, Amsterdam and Hamburg in Europe, Fort Lauderdale and Cape Floral in the US, and the Gold Coast in Australia have attracted huge investments for canalside housing and leisure.</p> \n<p>In Seoul, the renovation of the Cheonggyecheon Stream \u2013 an old sewerage ditch covered by a gigantic elevated highway that was torn down and restored with clean water, plants, wildlife and attractive landscaping \u2013 has been credited with reorienting the city (as well as sparking a property craze whose effects have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/20/end-of-an-era-seoul-prepares-to-rip-out-its-manufacturing-heart\">not all been positive</a>).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b75999c2da586f8c807725f7bb67100fa3def140\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b75999c2da586f8c807725f7bb67100fa3def140/0_101_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: TwilightShow/Getty Images</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>But few countries have as many urban canals as the UK, a legacy of British industrial might \u2013 and now a golden opportunity for transformation. Some, such as the Aldcliffe yard development in Lancaster, will see just a few expensive houses built on old industrial canal works; but many seek to create large new \u201cliveable\u201d urban communities in what were some of the Britain\u2019s polluted places, such as Wolverhampton, Leeds, Manchester, Lancaster, Glasgow, Liverpool and Birmingham.</p> \n<p>Together, they are removing some of the last vestiges of the dirty old industrial urban economy and steering cities towards a future based on inner-city living, retail, leisure and heritage.</p> \n<p>Middlewood Locks in Salford, Manchester, was the site of an iron-rolling mill, railway sidings and goods sheds. It is slated now to become Manchester\u2019s \u201cmost vibrant\u201d inner-city area: a \u00a3700m canalside development of homes to buy and rent, with shops, nurseries and gyms.</p> \n<p>Equally, Hale Wharf in Tottenham on the side of the Lee navigation in north London, was the site of furniture factories, gunpowder and timber stores. Soon it will have 500 houses in a \u201ccanalside realm\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bf5fe521bbbf504611d5a717e94b849ecdb05c9\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bf5fe521bbbf504611d5a717e94b849ecdb05c9/51_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A visualisation of Hale Wharf in Tottenham Hale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A visualisation of Hale Wharf in Tottenham Hale.

Old pictures show <a href=\"https://www.port-loop.com/about-port-loop\">Port Loop</a> at the height of the 19th-century industrial revolution with belching chimneys, wharfs, saw mills and glassworks, set among fields.

Unless they moved goods around, canals were regarded by government as polluted ditches, good only to be drained or filled in. Only the largest canals had survived the car economy. Anyone who took a boat out on the inland waterways for pleasure was considered eccentric.</p> \n<p>Three things unexpectedly changed everything. A postwar infant canal leisure industry emerged; dozens of passionate heritage charities like the Lapal trust voluntarily restored many of the old waterways; and water proved to be the vital ingredient to kickstart a new, property-based canal mania.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe restoration of the canals in the 1950s and 60s was thanks to a remarkable act of defiance by unpaid volunteers against the authorities,\u201d says canal historian Mike Clarke.</p> \n<p>\u201cVolunteers were vital. It\u2019s unlikely there would be many canals today without them. The government, many influential people, and the British Waterways board, were all happy to see the majority filled in. But the volunteers challenged them and started to restore them without any authority,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cThey told the government, \u2018if you want to complain, take us to court.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4310f0412767f92b66b4ef6060c99b6af7821281\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4310f0412767f92b66b4ef6060c99b6af7821281/0_0_4155_2832/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Union canal at Viewforth, Edinburgh\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Union canal at Viewforth, Edinburgh</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Rutherford/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>The Union canal at Viewforth, Edinburgh. Photograph: Ian Rutherford/Alamy</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>Government dared not take on the small army of volunteers, co-ordinated by the stroppy, infant Inland Waterways Association, the charity that since 1946 has promoted the revival of the UK canal system and whose members gave up weekends and millions of hours of free labour to dig out, restore and lobby for the country\u2019s 6,500 miles of canal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The restoration of Britain\u2019s canal system is in full flow but there is so much left to do</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alison Smedley, Inland Waterways Association</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cPeople had more leisure time, better education made them interested in their history, and the small English canals which had remained virtually unaltered for 200 years were of an ideal size for pleasure boats,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cThey formed isolated stretches of peaceful country within the urban environment. Planners eventually saw them as an asset, and government at last understood their potential for leisure.\u201d</p> \n<p>Once the canals were cleaned up and restored by the volunteers, regeneration followed. By the 1990s public funding from Europe and Westminster was unlocking billions of pounds of private capital. The result was that those polluted urban ditches, blocked off from the public and often filled with shopping trolleys and waste, became the bright new modern face of central Manchester, <a href=\"https://www.scottishcanals.co.uk/placemaking/glasgow-canal-project/\">Glasgow</a>, Bradford, Gloucester, Birmingham, London and dozens of other cities.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe job is only half done in Britain\u201d, says Alison Smedley, policy officer of the Inland Waterways Association. \u201cThe restoration of Britain\u2019s canal system is in full flow but there is so much left to do. There are about 4,700 miles of navigable waterway left in Britain, of which nearly 500 miles have been restored in the past 50 years, and 500 more miles are under active restoration. There are still about 1,800 miles left to be restored, although many [canals] have been filled in and are unlikely ever to be reclaimed,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>And just as canals linked cities and shaped the way they grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, they are now shaping urban renewal today. Canals have never been more popular, says the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the government-part-funded charity set up in 2012 to take over and manage the 2,000 miles of state-owned canal formerly run by British Waterways. It calculates that about 10 million people a year visit the canals to fish, walk, cycle, observe wildlife or go boating.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are now more licensed boats using the canals than at the height of the industrial revolution,\u201d says a spokeswoman.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0fa34e03b667d3eaff7803b05d18bc245f9b16eb\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fa34e03b667d3eaff7803b05d18bc245f9b16eb/60_122_4054_2433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A large flotilla gathers on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal at Speirs Wharf in Glasgow for the 10th anniversary of the reopening of the waterway.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A large flotilla gathers on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal at Speirs Wharf in Glasgow in 2011 for the 10th anniversary of the reopening of the waterway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Sandground</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>A flotilla on the Forth &amp; Clyde Canal at Speirs Wharf in Glasgow. Photograph: Peter Sandground</p></li> \n</ul> \n<p>In addition, canals have become a real alternative for people unable or unwilling to buy city property. The 100 miles of canals that run through London are now lined with vessels, and the city, with around 4,000 boats lived on by possibly 10,000 people, is thought to have a larger permanent floating community than Amsterdam with its 3,000 houseboats.</p> \n<p>Ten years ago 10% of the boats on British waterways were used as primary residences. It is now 26%, says the CRT.</p> \n<p>But concern is mounting that the CRT, which controls 11% of all moorings, is \u201cgentrifying\u201d the canals, reducing the number of long term public moorings and offering few facilities for people who want to live on boats.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere are not enough moorings, definitely,\u201d says Beryl McDowall, publicity officer for the Residential Boatowners\u2019 Association, which estimates 15,000 people now live afloat. Moorings [which were public] are going into the hands of private ownership and owners don\u2019t want the boats,\u201d she says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"21a4b5ab4f733f4bc46e2238ad857118f2fa989a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21a4b5ab4f733f4bc46e2238ad857118f2fa989a/0_317_5944_3566/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Speirs Wharf, Forth &amp; Clyde Canal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n</figure> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Speirs Wharf, Forth &amp; Clyde Canal, Glasgow.

When the CRT sells canalside space to developers the moorings often go. They are creating moorings for businesses but not for people\u201d, said a spokesman for the National Bargee Travellers Association.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere is an acute and chronic lack of basic facilities on London\u2019s waterways such as potable water taps, waste disposal facilities (for domestic waste, recycling, chemical toilets and motor oil), landside toilets and landside showers. For example there are only 17 water taps, 10 chemical toilet disposal facilities and 10 rubbish bins in the CRT Greater London region,\u201d said the NBTA.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe CRT is trying to force us off the water and turn the waterways into a money-making business\u201d, said one boater in London, who asked not to be named.</p> \n<p>This is disputed by Joe Coggins of the CRT. \u201cThere has been no reduction in moorings, but in a few isolated places we have given up moorings. We work with developers to keep moorings available.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a golden age for the canals. We welcome everybody on them. There has never been so much demand for moorings and we try to find a balance between those who want to move around and those who want permanent moorings. It\u2019s an acute challenge in London.\u201d</p> \n<p>Canal development may have changed the face of cities but the quality of building has been patchy. The Gas Street basin in Birmingham city centre, which is the hub of a labyrinth of 200-year-old canals, wharfs, quays and locks, is now a corporate honey-pot, with restaurants and bars, civic buildings, luxury flats and hotels.</p> \n<p>Yet a few miles away the Black Country canals of Wolverhampton, Dudley and Walsall see few boats. Many of these old waterways are lined with semi-derelict warehouses, recycling and scrap-metal yards, bottling plants and rusting industrial lifting gear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is a real opportunity for high quality inner-city development and nature to flourish together</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Simon Atkinson, Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Outside prestige city centre developments, many canalside buildings have been built with little sensitivity to either heritage or environment, says Smedley. Developers, especially in the 1970s and 80s, tried to cram in as many identikit houses as they could, and the result has in some places been an architectural mess with poor quality housing aimed at young professionals rather than families or the old, and low environmental or heritage value, she says.</p> \n<p>\u201cNot all developments can be said to be good. A lot could have been much better quality. It\u2019s getting better but mistakes were certainly made,\u201d says Smedley.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe golden age of canal restoration was 20 years ago. Around the millennium, around 200 miles of canal were restored, many with EU and government money. Many old routes were reopened, urban canals were developed, and new canals linking waterways constructed. Now the money has dried up. Our concern now is that urban sprawl along them will destroy the rural areas between cities,\u201d she says.</p> \n<p>Canalside regeneration has often led to gentrification and the takeover of places by the affluent. Wigan Pier, the semi-derelict site on the 18th century Leeds-Liverpool canal which George Orwell made famous in his 1937 portrait of northern living conditions, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/18/wigan-pier-to-get-makeover-under-new-plans-for-site-linked-to-orwell]\">is to be transformed</a>. In place of Orwell\u2019s tripe shops and pubs, the council and developers plan a \u201cmulti-leisure\u201d complex of gated townhouses, delis, a food hall, and a gin distillery.</p> \n<p>Certainly, restoration mania has given rise to tensions between developers and old-guard canal-users, and volunteers with developers accused of taking advantage of their voluntary work, says Mike Clarke. \u201cSometimes developers do things on the cheap which can cause upset. They see people on boats as easy targets to make money, charging them excessively. Sometimes they don\u2019t recognise the heritage value of the canals. But they accept that development must happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cAlmost unnoticed, the canals have become important sanctuaries for urban and rural wildlife,\u201d says Simon Atkinson, head of conservation at the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust. \u201cThey effectively form a huge linear national park and are incredibly important wildlife corridors, very high in ecological value.

      "bodyText": "Every second Monday of the month, a small group of volunteers meets in the training room of a Birmingham supermarket. They discuss what has long seemed to many of their friends a crazy and probably doomed idea: how to excavate a contaminated 40-year-old waste dump, create an urban marina, restore three miles of derelict canal and build several new bridges and locks. Last month, however, the meeting of the 18-strong Lapal Canal Trust committee was joyous. After 20 years of trying to restore this short stretch of the 200-year-old Dudley No 2 canal, permission had finally been granted, they were told. What\u2019s more, a feasibility study showed that the plan \u2013 which would link the suburbs of California and Selly Oak by water \u2013 could be a catalyst for nothing short of the economic and ecological renaissance of a large area of south Birmingham. The Lapal Canal Trust has ambitious plans to convert the Greenway into a working canal. Left: how it looks now, Right: an artist\u2019s impression of the transformation. Images: Lapal Canal Trust The new canal will generate jobs but also provide space for new houses, as well as pollution-free walking, boating and cycling routes. The marina for 60-100 boats will stimulate businesses and bring in tourists. The wildlife corridor created along the canal will attract herons, otters, fish and waterfowl. And although the whole project will cost about \u00a35m, the study said it would pay for itself in six years. \u201cIt will improve life in the city. It will complete an old canal loop around the city \u2013 we owe it to the future to restore it. We have support from business, the community, the university, developers and everyone. No one is objecting and we have nearly raised the first \u00a3250,000 \u2013 enough to start work,\u201d says the Lapal trust CEO, Hugh Humphreys. The Lapal plan is one of at least 80 canal renaissance projects currently making British towns and cities suitable for populations seeking tranquility, leisure space and new ways to move around. Just as canal-building drove urban growth in the 18th and 19th centuries by linking urban areas and stimulating trade, a new mania for canal developments is today reshaping cities by offering oases of calm in fastest-moving town centres. It\u2019s not just happening in Britain. Canal restoration, building and development is now a global phenomenon, with billions of dollars spent on projects annually around the world. From Paris to Milan, waterside developments can command 20% premium prices, and many cities with extensive canal networks, such as Bruges, Ghent, Amsterdam and Hamburg in Europe, Fort Lauderdale and Cape Floral in the US, and the Gold Coast in Australia have attracted huge investments for canalside housing and leisure. In Seoul, the renovation of the Cheonggyecheon Stream \u2013 an old sewerage ditch covered by a gigantic elevated highway that was torn down and restored with clean water, plants, wildlife and attractive landscaping \u2013 has been credited with reorienting the city (as well as sparking a property craze whose effects have not all been positive). Cheonggyecheon Stream in Seoul, South Korea. Photograph: TwilightShow/Getty Images But few countries have as many urban canals as the UK, a legacy of British industrial might \u2013 and now a golden opportunity for transformation. Some, such as the Aldcliffe yard development in Lancaster, will see just a few expensive houses built on old industrial canal works; but many seek to create large new \u201cliveable\u201d urban communities in what were some of the Britain\u2019s polluted places, such as Wolverhampton, Leeds, Manchester, Lancaster, Glasgow, Liverpool and Birmingham. Together, they are removing some of the last vestiges of the dirty old industrial urban economy and steering cities towards a future based on inner-city living, retail, leisure and heritage. Middlewood Locks in Salford, Manchester, was the site of an iron-rolling mill, railway sidings and goods sheds. It is slated now to become Manchester\u2019s \u201cmost vibrant\u201d inner-city area: a \u00a3700m canalside development of homes to buy and rent, with shops, nurseries and gyms. Equally, Hale Wharf in Tottenham on the side of the Lee navigation in north London, was the site of furniture factories, gunpowder and timber stores. Soon it will have 500 houses in a \u201ccanalside realm\u201d. A visualisation of Hale Wharf in Tottenham Hale. Image: Muse Developments Britain\u2019s most ambitious development is probably the Icknield Port Loop development, two miles from Birmingham city centre, where a massive 43 acres (18 hectares) of land between two of Britain\u2019s oldest canals has been cleared for a new neighbourhood of 1,100 houses, shops and leisure facilities. Old pictures show Port Loop at the height of the 19th-century industrial revolution with belching chimneys, wharfs, saw mills and glassworks, set among fields. The first new homes are now selling for \u00a3380,000 and up. Port Loop is a 43-acre, canalside site in Birmingham, just 15 mins from the city centre offering 1,150 new homes, retail and leisure spaces. Image: Places for People and Urban Splash Regeneration of the canals on this scale was barely imaginable even 50 years ago. Unless they moved goods around, canals were regarded by government as polluted ditches, good only to be drained or filled in. Only the largest canals had survived the car economy. Anyone who took a boat out on the inland waterways for pleasure was considered eccentric. Three things unexpectedly changed everything. A postwar infant canal leisure industry emerged; dozens of passionate heritage charities like the Lapal trust voluntarily restored many of the old waterways; and water proved to be the vital ingredient to kickstart a new, property-based canal mania. \u201cThe restoration of the canals in the 1950s and 60s was thanks to a remarkable act of defiance by unpaid volunteers against the authorities,\u201d says canal historian Mike Clarke. \u201cVolunteers were vital. It\u2019s unlikely there would be many canals today without them. The government, many influential people, and the British Waterways board, were all happy to see the majority filled in. But the volunteers challenged them and started to restore them without any authority,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cThey told the government, \u2018if you want to complain, take us to court.\u2019\u201d The Union canal at Viewforth, Edinburgh. Photograph: Ian Rutherford/Alamy Government dared not take on the small army of volunteers, co-ordinated by the stroppy, infant Inland Waterways Association, the charity that since 1946 has promoted the revival of the UK canal system and whose members gave up weekends and millions of hours of free labour to dig out, restore and lobby for the country\u2019s 6,500 miles of canal. \u201cPeople had more leisure time, better education made them interested in their history, and the small English canals which had remained virtually unaltered for 200 years were of an ideal size for pleasure boats,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cThey formed isolated stretches of peaceful country within the urban environment. Planners eventually saw them as an asset, and government at last understood their potential for leisure.\u201d Once the canals were cleaned up and restored by the volunteers, regeneration followed. By the 1990s public funding from Europe and Westminster was unlocking billions of pounds of private capital. The result was that those polluted urban ditches, blocked off from the public and often filled with shopping trolleys and waste, became the bright new modern face of central Manchester, Glasgow, Bradford, Gloucester, Birmingham, London and dozens of other cities. \u201cThe job is only half done in Britain\u201d, says Alison Smedley, policy officer of the Inland Waterways Association. \u201cThe restoration of Britain\u2019s canal system is in full flow but there is so much left to do. There are about 4,700 miles of navigable waterway left in Britain, of which nearly 500 miles have been restored in the past 50 years, and 500 more miles are under active restoration. There are still about 1,800 miles left to be restored, although many [canals] have been filled in and are unlikely ever to be reclaimed,\u201d she says. And just as canals linked cities and shaped the way they grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, they are now shaping urban renewal today. Canals have never been more popular, says the Canal and River Trust (CRT), the government-part-funded charity set up in 2012 to take over and manage the 2,000 miles of state-owned canal formerly run by British Waterways. It calculates that about 10 million people a year visit the canals to fish, walk, cycle, observe wildlife or go boating. \u201cThere are now more licensed boats using the canals than at the height of the industrial revolution,\u201d says a spokeswoman.

Photograph: Peter Sandground In addition, canals have become a real alternative for people unable or unwilling to buy city property. The 100 miles of canals that run through London are now lined with vessels, and the city, with around 4,000 boats lived on by possibly 10,000 people, is thought to have a larger permanent floating community than Amsterdam with its 3,000 houseboats. Ten years ago 10% of the boats on British waterways were used as primary residences. It is now 26%, says the CRT. But concern is mounting that the CRT, which controls 11% of all moorings, is \u201cgentrifying\u201d the canals, reducing the number of long term public moorings and offering few facilities for people who want to live on boats. \u201cThere are not enough moorings, definitely,\u201d says Beryl McDowall, publicity officer for the Residential Boatowners\u2019 Association, which estimates 15,000 people now live afloat. Moorings [which were public] are going into the hands of private ownership and owners don\u2019t want the boats,\u201d she says. Speirs Wharf, Forth &amp; Clyde Canal, Glasgow. Photographs: Shine-a-light/Gerard Ferry/Mike Dennison/Alamy \u201cWaterside developments often lead to a reduction in the provision of mooring space for boats. When the CRT sells canalside space to developers the moorings often go. They are creating moorings for businesses but not for people\u201d, said a spokesman for the National Bargee Travellers Association. \u201cThere is an acute and chronic lack of basic facilities on London\u2019s waterways such as potable water taps, waste disposal facilities (for domestic waste, recycling, chemical toilets and motor oil), landside toilets and landside showers. For example there are only 17 water taps, 10 chemical toilet disposal facilities and 10 rubbish bins in the CRT Greater London region,\u201d said the NBTA. \u201cThe CRT is trying to force us off the water and turn the waterways into a money-making business\u201d, said one boater in London, who asked not to be named. This is disputed by Joe Coggins of the CRT. \u201cThere has been no reduction in moorings, but in a few isolated places we have given up moorings. We work with developers to keep moorings available.\u201d \u201cThis is a golden age for the canals. We welcome everybody on them. There has never been so much demand for moorings and we try to find a balance between those who want to move around and those who want permanent moorings. It\u2019s an acute challenge in London.\u201d Canal development may have changed the face of cities but the quality of building has been patchy. The Gas Street basin in Birmingham city centre, which is the hub of a labyrinth of 200-year-old canals, wharfs, quays and locks, is now a corporate honey-pot, with restaurants and bars, civic buildings, luxury flats and hotels. Yet a few miles away the Black Country canals of Wolverhampton, Dudley and Walsall see few boats. Many of these old waterways are lined with semi-derelict warehouses, recycling and scrap-metal yards, bottling plants and rusting industrial lifting gear. Outside prestige city centre developments, many canalside buildings have been built with little sensitivity to either heritage or environment, says Smedley. Developers, especially in the 1970s and 80s, tried to cram in as many identikit houses as they could, and the result has in some places been an architectural mess with poor quality housing aimed at young professionals rather than families or the old, and low environmental or heritage value, she says. \u201cNot all developments can be said to be good. A lot could have been much better quality. It\u2019s getting better but mistakes were certainly made,\u201d says Smedley. \u201cThe golden age of canal restoration was 20 years ago. Around the millennium, around 200 miles of canal were restored, many with EU and government money. Many old routes were reopened, urban canals were developed, and new canals linking waterways constructed. Now the money has dried up. Our concern now is that urban sprawl along them will destroy the rural areas between cities,\u201d she says. Canalside regeneration has often led to gentrification and the takeover of places by the affluent. Wigan Pier, the semi-derelict site on the 18th century Leeds-Liverpool canal which George Orwell made famous in his 1937 portrait of northern living conditions, is to be transformed. In place of Orwell\u2019s tripe shops and pubs, the council and developers plan a \u201cmulti-leisure\u201d complex of gated townhouses, delis, a food hall, and a gin distillery. Certainly, restoration mania has given rise to tensions between developers and old-guard canal-users, and volunteers with developers accused of taking advantage of their voluntary work, says Mike Clarke. \u201cSometimes developers do things on the cheap which can cause upset. They see people on boats as easy targets to make money, charging them excessively. Sometimes they don\u2019t recognise the heritage value of the canals. But they accept that development must happen.\u201d \u201cAlmost unnoticed, the canals have become important sanctuaries for urban and rural wildlife,\u201d says Simon Atkinson, head of conservation at the Birmingham and Black Country Wildlife Trust. \u201cThey effectively form a huge linear national park and are incredibly important wildlife corridors, very high in ecological value. They are like long ponds.\u201d Otters, water voles, kingfishers, ducks, herons, fish, dragon- and damsel flies, even rabbits, are seen on the 100-odd miles of Birmingham canals, some of which are classed as local nature reserves. \u201cThere is more wildlife on these canals than there is in many industrial farming landscapes. There has been dereliction on these canals since the 1880s. It has led to opportunities for wildlife to take hold,\u201d Atkinson says. \u201cBut we are at a crossroads. Water pollution has been largely stopped but planning can be weak and some places have been developed terribly, allowing wildlife no access to the water, no open spaces. \u201cIf development is done well, it can enhance nature. The canals have never been more important, but it could go the other way. There is a real opportunity for high quality inner-city development and nature to flourish together.\u201d Back in South Birmingham, work is preparing to start on the first stage of the Dudley canal. Where it was once the dream of a few passionate people interested in urban heritage, today it is regarded by the city as an important link between the industrial past and the leisure-based future. \u201cMany people still have no idea that the old Dudley No 2 canal ever existed, let alone that Selly Oak was a hive of Victorian industry,\u201d says Hugh Humphreys. Their surprise \u2013 and probable delight \u2013 when in a few years\u2019 time they find canal boats motoring past Sainsbury\u2019s supermarket at a stately 4mph, and see otters and kingfishers at the bottom of their gardens, may just be worth the 200-year wait.

      "body": "<p>Heartbreak Ridge sits in the east of the demilitarised zone, a 160-mile-long stretch that has separated North and South Korea since the end of the war in 1953. It got its name from an American journalist who reported on a particularly bloody battle there in 1951. Thousands of Korean, Chinese, American and French soldiers died in the space of a month and yet very little was gained from the fighting. Countless bodies remain where they fell, preserved in the mud.</p> <p>In the late 2000s, I was commissioned by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense and a national newspaper to photograph <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/21/north-korea-south-korea-dmz-landmines\">the DMZ</a> to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/26/war-detectives-get-new-lead-on-british-dead-from-korean-war-thanks-to-trump\">the Korean war</a> in 1950. I was the first civilian photographer to enter the region since the zone was established. I first went in 2009, but the process was tightly controlled and I was only ever allowed into the southern half. Every time I crossed the civilian control zone checkpoints, I was escorted by an armed military squad. Most roads in the DMZ are unpaved and almost unusable, and the eastern part is mountainous. Most days, I would have to travel for hours to reach a given location, and then trek the remaining distance.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Koreans who died were not experienced soldiers. They were teenagers drafted from the street and sent to the frontline. Many died in their first weeks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Being in the DMZ was was one of the saddest experiences of my life. The Koreans who died in the war were not experienced soldiers. They were teenagers or in their early 20s, drafted from the street and sent to the frontline. Many were killed in their first two or three weeks of battle. The corpses that remain have never been formally buried or identified.</p> <p>In this image, you can see army personnel from Makri, the government agency tasked with recovering and identifying war remains. Makri staff usually research battles using old documents and maps. Once they finalise the place where a battle occurred, they start to excavate with a shovel. If they find any war remains, they perform a short ceremony to commemorate the dead \u2014 a kind of makeshift funeral for people who never received one. Then they use fine brushes to clean the remains without damaging them.</p> <p>Like this photo, many war remains are found with rifles and bullet clips, and the bodies lie in the exact position they fell, preserved in the mud, as if they are frozen in time. You can see that this soldier was killed by a bullet wound to the head. But apart from that, we knew nothing about him.</p> <p>Once the bones are collected, Makri moves them to their headquarters to start DNA testing. They try to establish the body\u2019s nationality, and then arrange the transfer of the remains to their country of origin \u2014 usually China, the US or the North. Once or twice a year, North Korea allows the delivery of war remains. It\u2019s one of the few points of collaboration that remains in our divided country.</p> <p>I was meant to spend two years documenting the DMZ, but my time was cut short. In March 2010, a North Korean torpedo sank a South Korean battleship near the border, killing half the crew. It was a major incident, and the North said they would shoot any journalist seen entering the DMZ. The South Korean government revoked my permission, and I have never since been allowed in. For this photo, which was taken in 2012, I had to zoom in using a telephoto lens from a nearby outpost.</p> <p>One day, I hope to return and finish the project. I believe that photography has a significant role to play in explaining the human impact of the DMZ. It humanises the situation and reminds the world of what is lost by being a divided country.</p> <p>For the older generation, the Korean war was the worst time of their life, but that memory seems to be fading.

      "bodyText": "Heartbreak Ridge sits in the east of the demilitarised zone, a 160-mile-long stretch that has separated North and South Korea since the end of the war in 1953. It got its name from an American journalist who reported on a particularly bloody battle there in 1951. Thousands of Korean, Chinese, American and French soldiers died in the space of a month and yet very little was gained from the fighting. Countless bodies remain where they fell, preserved in the mud. In the late 2000s, I was commissioned by the South Korean Ministry of National Defense and a national newspaper to photograph the DMZ to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950. I was the first civilian photographer to enter the region since the zone was established. I first went in 2009, but the process was tightly controlled and I was only ever allowed into the southern half. Every time I crossed the civilian control zone checkpoints, I was escorted by an armed military squad. Most roads in the DMZ are unpaved and almost unusable, and the eastern part is mountainous. Most days, I would have to travel for hours to reach a given location, and then trek the remaining distance. Being in the DMZ was was one of the saddest experiences of my life. The Koreans who died in the war were not experienced soldiers. They were teenagers or in their early 20s, drafted from the street and sent to the frontline. Many were killed in their first two or three weeks of battle. The corpses that remain have never been formally buried or identified. In this image, you can see army personnel from Makri, the government agency tasked with recovering and identifying war remains. Makri staff usually research battles using old documents and maps. Once they finalise the place where a battle occurred, they start to excavate with a shovel. If they find any war remains, they perform a short ceremony to commemorate the dead \u2014 a kind of makeshift funeral for people who never received one. Then they use fine brushes to clean the remains without damaging them. Like this photo, many war remains are found with rifles and bullet clips, and the bodies lie in the exact position they fell, preserved in the mud, as if they are frozen in time. You can see that this soldier was killed by a bullet wound to the head. But apart from that, we knew nothing about him. Once the bones are collected, Makri moves them to their headquarters to start DNA testing. They try to establish the body\u2019s nationality, and then arrange the transfer of the remains to their country of origin \u2014 usually China, the US or the North. Once or twice a year, North Korea allows the delivery of war remains. It\u2019s one of the few points of collaboration that remains in our divided country. I was meant to spend two years documenting the DMZ, but my time was cut short. In March 2010, a North Korean torpedo sank a South Korean battleship near the border, killing half the crew. It was a major incident, and the North said they would shoot any journalist seen entering the DMZ. The South Korean government revoked my permission, and I have never since been allowed in. For this photo, which was taken in 2012, I had to zoom in using a telephoto lens from a nearby outpost. One day, I hope to return and finish the project. I believe that photography has a significant role to play in explaining the human impact of the DMZ. It humanises the situation and reminds the world of what is lost by being a divided country. For the older generation, the Korean war was the worst time of their life, but that memory seems to be fading. After a second and now a third generation, neither of which have ever known combat, the war is slipping from the public consciousness. I don\u2019t know what will happen to the DMZ in the future. The political situation is too unpredictable to tell. But I think collecting the war remains is the strongest barrier against another war. \u2022 DMZ: Demilitarized Zone of Korea by Park Jongwoo is published by Steidl.

      "body": "<p>A doctor who has said he invented a procedure to \u201creverse\u201d abortion has for years falsely claimed an affiliation to a prestigious US medical school, the Guardian can reveal.</p> <p>A medication abortion is an FDA-approved procedure and is administered through two doses of medicine over 48 hours. Medication abortions now represent nearly <a href=\"https://www.guttmacher.org/gpr/2018/10/self-managed-medication-abortion-expanding-available-options-us-abortion-care\">one-third</a> of all abortions nationally, according to the Guttmacher Institute. There is no reversal procedure. </p> <p>But Dr George Delgado, the medical director of Culture of Life Family Services in San Diego, claims to have<strong> </strong>invented a \u201creversal\u201d, in which women are given a large dose of progesterone following the first dose of a medicated abortion.</p> <p>Delgado\u2019s assertions about the \u201creversal\u201d procedure have been denounced as \u201cunproven and unethical\u201d in a statement from America\u2019s largest association of women\u2019s doctors, the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/-/media/Departments/Government-Relations-and-Outreach/FactsAreImportantMedicationAbortionReversal.pdf\">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>.

North Dakota legislators recently passed a law forcing doctors to tell patients medication abortions are reversible, the <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/ama-lawsuit-protect-patient-physician-relationship-north-dakota\">fifth</a> state to do so in 2019.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/13/donald-trump-evangelical-christians-republicans-abortion-supreme-court\">Extreme abortion laws shine light on Trump's courting of religious right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The American Medical Association is now suing North Dakota for forcing doctors to \u201cmisinform their patients that medication abortion may be \u2018reversible\u2019, which is contrary to science\u201d, and said the law forced \u201cphysicians \u2018[to] convey ideological, government-mandated messages that are false or misleading\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Delgado has been listing an affiliation with the University of California San Diego (UCSD), even after the university asked him to stop last year.</p> <p>Delgado worked in UCSD\u2019s department of family medicine as a voluntary clinical associate professor beginning in 2005, but left in June 2011, according to the school. The school could not describe the scope of Delgado\u2019s duties, but said his position was unpaid, and may have been \u201cas little as teaching a class once a year\u201d, according to the university spokesperson Scott LaFee.</p> <p>Since 2011, Delgado has practiced at the Culture of Life Family Services clinic in California, where he provides Catholic-oriented \u201cpro-life\u201d medicine. The clinic advertises \u201c<a href=\"https://www.colfs.org/page/10-About/\">Christ-centered</a> medical care\u201d.</p> <p>The Culture of Life Family Services clinics in Escondido and San Diego, California, were included in successful applications for federal family planning funding approved by the Trump administration. The two clinics were listed as \u201csub-recipients\u201d in a $5.9m grant proposal submitted to the Trump administration by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/12/google-advertising-abortion-obria\">Obria Group</a>. Obria would later be awarded $1.7m per year.</p> <p>Obria Group, through the Republican crisis communications firm <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/21/ed-whelan-kavanaugh-tweets-pr-firm-836405\">CRC Public Relations</a>, said the clinics were not included on the \u201cfinal list\u201d of sub-recipients for the $1.7m grant, but did not elaborate, or say which clinics were on the final list. CRC also said the abortion \u201creversal\u201d is \u201cnot reimbursable in the Title X program\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian repeatedly tried to reach the Culture of Life Family Services clinic, but an office manager did not return multiple phone inquiries.</p> <p>In the grant proposal, Culture of Life Family Services committed to care for 750 low-income women seeking family planning services. The amount of federal funds the clinic would have received is redacted in a copy of the federal grant application seen by the Guardian.</p> <p>Delgado appears to have listed an affiliation with USCD since 2011, including in a December 2012 case report published in the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23191936\">Annals of Pharmacotherapy</a>, and as recently as November 2018 in a speaker biography posted on the website <a href=\"https://www.catholic.com/profile/dr-george-delgado\">Catholic Answers</a>. That affiliation listed on Catholic Answers was removed after inquiries from the Guardian.</p> <p>The anti-abortion <a href=\"https://lozierinstitute.org/team-member/george-delgado/\">Charlotte Lozier Institute</a> website also listed Delgado as a \u201cVoluntary Associate Clinical Professor at the UCSD School of Medicine\u201d at the time of publication. He is not, three university officials said.</p> <p>In response to emailed questions from the Guardian, Delgado said: \u201cAs soon as I received a copy of the letter from [University of California San Diego] I stopped listing an affiliation with UCSD.\u201d He added that websites still listing the affiliation \u201cmust be using old quotes in their materials\u201d.</p> <p>He declined an interview request due to \u201cwork responsibilities\u201d, and did not respond to further emailed inquiries, including about federal funding.</p> <p><a href=\"https://lozierinstitute.org/team-member/george-delgado/\">Delgado\u2019s most recent </a><a href=\"https://lozierinstitute.org/team-member/george-delgado/\">work</a> has included speaking engagements providing pseudo-scientific cover for anti-abortion campaigners attacking<strong> </strong>medication abortions as they grow increasingly common. Delgado has also <a href=\"https://catholicspeakers.com/profiles/george-delgado-md\">pushed the false claim</a> that abortion is linked to breast cancer.</p> <p>The UCSD School of Medicine said Delgado, \u201cwas instructed\u201d by his former department to stop using the school\u2019s name after he <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29108160\">cited it as his affiliation</a> in a widely criticized, and briefly retracted, April 2018 paper.</p> <p>When the article was again released, Delgado listed the Steno Institute as his research institution.

      "bodyText": "A doctor who has said he invented a procedure to \u201creverse\u201d abortion has for years falsely claimed an affiliation to a prestigious US medical school, the Guardian can reveal. A medication abortion is an FDA-approved procedure and is administered through two doses of medicine over 48 hours. Medication abortions now represent nearly one-third of all abortions nationally, according to the Guttmacher Institute. There is no reversal procedure. But Dr George Delgado, the medical director of Culture of Life Family Services in San Diego, claims to have invented a \u201creversal\u201d, in which women are given a large dose of progesterone following the first dose of a medicated abortion. Delgado\u2019s assertions about the \u201creversal\u201d procedure have been denounced as \u201cunproven and unethical\u201d in a statement from America\u2019s largest association of women\u2019s doctors, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. His work has been described as an \u201cunmonitored research experiment\u201d in an article in the New England Journal of Medicine. Despite condemnation from the medical community, Delgado\u2019s claims have been adopted by some Republican state legislators as part of a wider campaign to undermine women\u2019s reproductive rights. North Dakota legislators recently passed a law forcing doctors to tell patients medication abortions are reversible, the fifth state to do so in 2019. The American Medical Association is now suing North Dakota for forcing doctors to \u201cmisinform their patients that medication abortion may be \u2018reversible\u2019, which is contrary to science\u201d, and said the law forced \u201cphysicians \u2018[to] convey ideological, government-mandated messages that are false or misleading\u2019.\u201d Delgado has been listing an affiliation with the University of California San Diego (UCSD), even after the university asked him to stop last year. Delgado worked in UCSD\u2019s department of family medicine as a voluntary clinical associate professor beginning in 2005, but left in June 2011, according to the school. The school could not describe the scope of Delgado\u2019s duties, but said his position was unpaid, and may have been \u201cas little as teaching a class once a year\u201d, according to the university spokesperson Scott LaFee. Since 2011, Delgado has practiced at the Culture of Life Family Services clinic in California, where he provides Catholic-oriented \u201cpro-life\u201d medicine. The clinic advertises \u201cChrist-centered medical care\u201d. The Culture of Life Family Services clinics in Escondido and San Diego, California, were included in successful applications for federal family planning funding approved by the Trump administration. The two clinics were listed as \u201csub-recipients\u201d in a $5.9m grant proposal submitted to the Trump administration by the Obria Group. Obria would later be awarded $1.7m per year. Obria Group, through the Republican crisis communications firm CRC Public Relations, said the clinics were not included on the \u201cfinal list\u201d of sub-recipients for the $1.7m grant, but did not elaborate, or say which clinics were on the final list. CRC also said the abortion \u201creversal\u201d is \u201cnot reimbursable in the Title X program\u201d. The Guardian repeatedly tried to reach the Culture of Life Family Services clinic, but an office manager did not return multiple phone inquiries. In the grant proposal, Culture of Life Family Services committed to care for 750 low-income women seeking family planning services. The amount of federal funds the clinic would have received is redacted in a copy of the federal grant application seen by the Guardian. Delgado appears to have listed an affiliation with USCD since 2011, including in a December 2012 case report published in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy, and as recently as November 2018 in a speaker biography posted on the website Catholic Answers. That affiliation listed on Catholic Answers was removed after inquiries from the Guardian. The anti-abortion Charlotte Lozier Institute website also listed Delgado as a \u201cVoluntary Associate Clinical Professor at the UCSD School of Medicine\u201d at the time of publication. He is not, three university officials said. In response to emailed questions from the Guardian, Delgado said: \u201cAs soon as I received a copy of the letter from [University of California San Diego] I stopped listing an affiliation with UCSD.\u201d He added that websites still listing the affiliation \u201cmust be using old quotes in their materials\u201d. He declined an interview request due to \u201cwork responsibilities\u201d, and did not respond to further emailed inquiries, including about federal funding. Delgado\u2019s most recent work has included speaking engagements providing pseudo-scientific cover for anti-abortion campaigners attacking medication abortions as they grow increasingly common. Delgado has also pushed the false claim that abortion is linked to breast cancer. The UCSD School of Medicine said Delgado, \u201cwas instructed\u201d by his former department to stop using the school\u2019s name after he cited it as his affiliation in a widely criticized, and briefly retracted, April 2018 paper. When the article was again released, Delgado listed the Steno Institute as his research institution. The Steno Institute was registered with the California secretary of state on 24 July 2018 by Delgado, with a mission \u201cto further abortion pill reversal and other pro-life research\u201d. While the abortion pill reversal is often described as a \u201ctreatment\u201d in media releases from anti-abortion groups, Delgado only has published one case report of six patients in a medical journal. Another article published by Delgado, in a fringe legal journal called Issues in Law &amp; Medicine, was temporarily retracted for overstating the level of review by an institutional review board, according to the New England Journal of Medicine. \u201cThe bottom line is there is no evidence this treatment is effective,\u201d said Dr Daniel Grossman, a professor of gynecology at the University of California San Francisco\u2019s Bixby Center for Global Reproductive Health. Grossman wrote an analysis published in the New England Journal of Medicine last year describing Delgado\u2019s work as an \u201cunmonitored research experiment\u201d, and adding that laws forcing physicians to tell women about it were \u201ca disturbing intrusion into the relationship between physicians and their patients\u201d. He told the Guardian: \u201cThis clearly is research, and research must be done under the review of an institutional review board or an independent review panel.\u201d \u201cPatients need to be given informed consent about any research they may participate in so they understand the potential risks benefits and alternatives to this experimental treatment.\u201d Medication abortions rely on two medications taken 48 hours apart to induce an abortion: mifepristone followed by misoprostol. Mifepristone blocks progesterone, which leads to the disruption of a pregnancy. The second medication is required because a termination will not be successful in up to 48% of women, some studies have found. This story was amended on 29 July 2019 to remove a description of medication abortion as \u201cself-managed\u201d. In fact, medication abortions may or may not be managed outside a clinical setting.",

Never mind that they might register to most as white by appearance, or that there is hardly a trace of black ancestry left in their blood. This inherited identity most East Jackson residents still cling to and fiercely protect is based on where they were born and who they were told they are. It comes from a history rooted in racism and an identity placed upon their ancestors \u2013 and now many of them \u2013 without their consent.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Line break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Line break</a> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"9fe5995cda15e63a3580ece47b75566b02cfafab\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9fe5995cda15e63a3580ece47b75566b02cfafab/0_0_2800_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"East Jackson is a small community in Southern Ohio where many residents identify as black despite appearing white.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">East Jackson is a small community in southern Ohio where many residents identify as black despite appearing white.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maddie McGarvey/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>East Jackson is, essentially, one long street</strong> off the 335 highway after a stretch of green fields. There is no town center, just a cluster of dirt-paved driveways in front of derelict homes passed down from one family member to another. A stone bridge separates East Jackson from neighboring Waverly, a larger, mostly white town.</p> \n<p>Though some might say East Jackson does not exist on a map, a number of places pop up on a GPS: the sole bar, owned by Jeff Jackson, otherwise known as Gus; his paving business right behind it; a convenience store; a handful of churches. In the baptist church, a cluster of blond teenage girls sit together in a pew; older women sit towards the front, then greet the pastor, who identifies as black, after service.</p> \n<p>Five miles down the road, Waverly boasts field after field of lush farmland and well-maintained homes. With its drive-thrus, car dealerships, Walmart and a giant grocery store assigned its own Starbucks, along with the sudden appearance of traffic, there is a sense of urgency compared to the quieter East Jackson.</p> \n<p>This contrast is a byproduct of anti-abolitionist sentiment in Waverly that began nearly 200 years ago. Ohio was established as a free state at the start of the 19th century, but those fleeing slavery in the south by using Ohio\u2019s underground railroads avoided Waverly. It was known to be anti-abolition and anti-black. It was also a <a href=\"https://sundown.tougaloo.edu/sundowntowns.php\">sundown town,</a> where black people had to be out of town by dark or face arrest, threats or violence.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"598b0294-f043-4f32-b53a-3090f31c3de6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/H9mtCLL8rI0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Officials in Waverly created East Jackson by corralling any newcomer they deemed to be black because of their appearance, or by second-class status because they were laborers or housekeepers, into the smaller town. Some forced to stay in East Jackson were not black, but because they all lived in East Jackson, grew up together and were treated as black by law, a community that identified as black took root. They married across racial lines, and had multiracial children. Over generations, as fewer black people sought this area out, black heritage thinned out. But black identity did not.</p> \n<p>The town functions as a microcosm of what African Americans have had to deal with in America, says Dr Barbara Ellen Smith, a professor emerita who has spent much of her career focused on inequality in Appalachia. Alongside the rise of anti-slavery laws was a parallel rise of what historians and scholars call \u201cblack laws\u201d including the one-drop rule \u2013 that one drop of \u201cblack blood\u201d disqualified an individual from having the legal status of whites \u2013 which became a widely accepted <a href=\"https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/6457/Crossing%20the%20Color%20Line.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\">social attitude</a><a href=\"https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/bitstream/handle/1803/6457/Crossing%20the%20Color%20Line.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\"> in Ohio</a> beginning in the 1860s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\" data-alt=\"Line break\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2018/02/divider/index.html\">Line break</a> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Shreck\u2019s father was a laborer</strong>.

The first time Oiler went to a new doctor in the 1980s, she marked black for her race on an intake form. The doctor asked why she would do that because she clearly was not an African American \u2013 \u201cnot a nigger\u201d, she says she told her \u2013 evaluating her red hair, light skin and freckles. Furious, Oiler told her she was black, and that that was the end of the discussion.</p> \n<p>Oiler ticks off her black ancestors on her fingers: grandmother, grandfather, mother. A picture of Oiler\u2019s grandparents hangs on her floral wallpaper. Her grandma was half Native American and half black, and her grandfather identified as white. She says her other set of grandparents were similar: grandfather was black, grandmother was white. \u201cThe only reason I turned out white was to do with dad\u2019s pigment from his mother. That was all,\u201d the 65-year-old grandmother says, patting her curly white hair.</p> \n<p>\u201cMaybe the black has run out of the bloodstream, I don\u2019t know. But I still consider myself as what my mom put me as, and that\u2019s exactly what I say I am,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re either one or the other. That\u2019s the way I look at it. You can\u2019t be both.\u201d</p> \n<p>Being treated like outsiders and identifying as people of color, Oiler and Shreck, like many in this township, have chosen to stand behind their identities. They do it proudly, despite having heard people refer to their community as trash and the slums as long as they can remember. Even today, Oiler says: \u201cThey say East Jackson has negroes. But they don\u2019t say negroes. They say niggers.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"96dfe43d40abedf92c96e4e45080da5281065329\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96dfe43d40abedf92c96e4e45080da5281065329/0_0_2800_1867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jimmy Shreck in his kitchen in East Jackson.

She slowly unfolds it to present her birth certificate. \u201cNegro\u201d, it reads, next to each of her parents\u2019 names. She looks up triumphantly, victory in her periwinkle eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s a legal document,\u201d she says. The last known full-blooded black person in her family was her great-great-grandfather Thomas Byrd, her parents told her. Photos of them, who both look white, adorn the wooden walls on either side of Shreck\u2019s chair. Their stares follow her throughout their former home. They are the ones who told her she was black. \u201cI\u2019m 53 years old, and that\u2019s all I\u2019ve ever been raised as: black,\u201d Shreck says. \u201cSo if you\u2019re taught that from when I\u2019m old enough to understand, up to when you\u2019re a grown woman, then [it\u2019s] born and bred in you and you\u2019re automatically black.\u201d As first reported in State of the Re:Union, most of Shreck\u2019s generation and the generations before her here in East Jackson, on the edge of Appalachian Ohio, were raised to believe they are black. Never mind that they might register to most as white by appearance, or that there is hardly a trace of black ancestry left in their blood. This inherited identity most East Jackson residents still cling to and fiercely protect is based on where they were born and who they were told they are. It comes from a history rooted in racism and an identity placed upon their ancestors \u2013 and now many of them \u2013 without their consent. East Jackson is, essentially, one long street off the 335 highway after a stretch of green fields. There is no town center, just a cluster of dirt-paved driveways in front of derelict homes passed down from one family member to another. A stone bridge separates East Jackson from neighboring Waverly, a larger, mostly white town. Though some might say East Jackson does not exist on a map, a number of places pop up on a GPS: the sole bar, owned by Jeff Jackson, otherwise known as Gus; his paving business right behind it; a convenience store; a handful of churches. In the baptist church, a cluster of blond teenage girls sit together in a pew; older women sit towards the front, then greet the pastor, who identifies as black, after service. Five miles down the road, Waverly boasts field after field of lush farmland and well-maintained homes. With its drive-thrus, car dealerships, Walmart and a giant grocery store assigned its own Starbucks, along with the sudden appearance of traffic, there is a sense of urgency compared to the quieter East Jackson. This contrast is a byproduct of anti-abolitionist sentiment in Waverly that began nearly 200 years ago. Ohio was established as a free state at the start of the 19th century, but those fleeing slavery in the south by using Ohio\u2019s underground railroads avoided Waverly. It was known to be anti-abolition and anti-black. It was also a sundown town, where black people had to be out of town by dark or face arrest, threats or violence. Officials in Waverly created East Jackson by corralling any newcomer they deemed to be black because of their appearance, or by second-class status because they were laborers or housekeepers, into the smaller town. Some forced to stay in East Jackson were not black, but because they all lived in East Jackson, grew up together and were treated as black by law, a community that identified as black took root. They married across racial lines, and had multiracial children. Over generations, as fewer black people sought this area out, black heritage thinned out. But black identity did not. The town functions as a microcosm of what African Americans have had to deal with in America, says Dr Barbara Ellen Smith, a professor emerita who has spent much of her career focused on inequality in Appalachia. Alongside the rise of anti-slavery laws was a parallel rise of what historians and scholars call \u201cblack laws\u201d including the one-drop rule \u2013 that one drop of \u201cblack blood\u201d disqualified an individual from having the legal status of whites \u2013 which became a widely accepted social attitude in Ohio beginning in the 1860s. Shreck\u2019s father was a laborer. He told her he was Irish but also told people he was black. Her mother, a homemaker, identified as black, though the only reason she considered herself black, as her daughter does now, is because of her great-grandfather Thomas Byrd. They sent Shreck to Waverly after the elementary school in East Jackson closed, just as all the families did. \u201cThe kids there didn\u2019t want to bother with us,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to school dressed as good as any other kid in Waverly. I think it was just where we had come from.\u201d A few paces down the 335, on an unmarked dirt road with a rickety wooden bridge over a slip of water, sits Roberta \u201cBert\u201d Oiler\u2019s home. She is Shreck\u2019s first cousin, though in East Jackson, everyone claims everyone as family. Until Oiler was born in 1954, when residents of East Jackson went into Waverly, they were not allowed to use bathrooms in town, her mother told her. Oiler says when she was in high school in Waverly in the 1960s, even teachers picked on students from East Jackson, and seemed surprised when they answered questions correctly. \u201c\u2018Huh, well, I guess you are pretty smart.\u2019 That\u2019s what we got,\u201d Oiler snorts, the memory stinging nearly 50 years later. Those experiences continued well after adolescence. The first time Oiler went to a new doctor in the 1980s, she marked black for her race on an intake form. The doctor asked why she would do that because she clearly was not an African American \u2013 \u201cnot a nigger\u201d, she says she told her \u2013 evaluating her red hair, light skin and freckles. Furious, Oiler told her she was black, and that that was the end of the discussion. Oiler ticks off her black ancestors on her fingers: grandmother, grandfather, mother. A picture of Oiler\u2019s grandparents hangs on her floral wallpaper. Her grandma was half Native American and half black, and her grandfather identified as white. She says her other set of grandparents were similar: grandfather was black, grandmother was white. \u201cThe only reason I turned out white was to do with dad\u2019s pigment from his mother. That was all,\u201d the 65-year-old grandmother says, patting her curly white hair. \u201cMaybe the black has run out of the bloodstream, I don\u2019t know. But I still consider myself as what my mom put me as, and that\u2019s exactly what I say I am,\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re either one or the other. That\u2019s the way I look at it. You can\u2019t be both.\u201d Being treated like outsiders and identifying as people of color, Oiler and Shreck, like many in this township, have chosen to stand behind their identities. They do it proudly, despite having heard people refer to their community as trash and the slums as long as they can remember. Even today, Oiler says: \u201cThey say East Jackson has negroes. But they don\u2019t say negroes. They say niggers.\u201d In recent years, some East Jackson residents have shifted their identity. Oiler\u2019s sister, Sarah Harris, 74, has come to identify as Native American in the latter stages of her life. Until a few years ago, she lived as a black woman. Harris\u2019s birth certificate notes her parents as \u201cdark\u201d, and that has been part of her reasoning for identifying as Catawba Indian. She has even obtained an identification card that proclaims her new status, even though she has never taken a genetic test to confirm it. \u201cI don\u2019t care what I am. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Harris says. She looks over at her husband, Brad, sitting in front of the television, who has generally been quiet for the past five years after suffering a stroke. \u201cI married a black man, didn\u2019t I?\u201d she says, walking over to her partner of nearly 60 years and planting a peck on his lips. Brad is paler than most residents in East Jackson, and would easily pass as white, but he is from a prominent family in the community which has identified as black since anyone can remember. \u201cIf you had a kid in East Jackson, they were black,\u201d Harris says. But of her eight children, only three still identify as black. Four others, like her, identify as Catawba Indian, and her son, Jeff \u2013 who dons a dusting of freckles and a red afro \u2013 identifies as white. Oiler has a daughter, Janelle Hines, who identifies as mixed. \u201cI never connected myself to East Jackson. Because they would have never gave you a chance,\u201d says Hines, 35, adjusting her blond ponytail. \u201cI had a friend in high school and I really, really wanted her to come out here,\u201d Hines says. \u201cAt first, her parents were OK with it, until they found out where I lived. And this is how I figured out how to word where I lived when I was 15.\u201d When the friend\u2019s father found out, Hines says he went ballistic. She knows this because she was on the phone with her friend while he screamed profanities and used the N-word. \u201cYou are not going up there and being raped or killed or strung up,\u201d she recalls him saying. Oiler\u2019s other daughter, Hines\u2019s younger sister, identifies as white and moved away from East Jackson. Shreck also has one daughter who identifies as black, and one who identifies as white, she says, sitting in her usual chair, with her walker and oxygen tank next to her. As if on cue, the front door creaks open and Shreck\u2019s 36-year-old daughter, Carlotta Hixon, walks into the sitting room with her 17-year-old daughter in tow. The older mother and daughter pair share similar features \u2013 thick, frizzy hair, brown eyes, and olive complexions. Shreck\u2019s younger daughter, Alison Lewis, probably has gotten further in life, Hixon admits, because by the time the two were in Waverly for high school, her sister was identifying as white. When classmates asked why one sister identified as black and the other white, the younger sister would tell them they had different fathers, even though it was not true. The next day, Alison visits her family in East Jackson. She lives a few miles east of her old home and lets it be known she is a resident of Beaver. \u201cI was about 12 and I decided I was going to be white regardless, so I told everybody I was white,\u201d Alison continues, glancing over at her mother. \u201cLook at my eyes,\u201d she demands. \u201cThey\u2019re blue. I\u2019m not black.\u201d Shreck\u2019s mouth is clamped as she tries to let her daughter speak. But she can\u2019t hold it in. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with being black?\u201d she asks her daughter. \u201cNothing wrong if you are black,\u201d her daughter retorts. \u201cYour parents weren\u2019t black,\u201d Alison reminds her mother. \u201cThey went by black even though they weren\u2019t black. To me, that would be denying my parents and my heritage,\u201d Shreck says. They go back and forth for minutes before Shreck ends their argument with a refrain commonly heard among the older generation in East Jackson: \u201cYou can be what you want to be and I will be what I want to be.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A nine-year-old girl has been tossed into the air by a bison at Yellowstone national park after the bull charged at a group of about 50 visitors who were standing too close to the wild animals. It was the latest incident in a growing catalogue of humans becoming casualties after approaching animals or taking selfies on dangerous ledges or close to wildlife in some of America\u2019s most spectacular nature spots. Dramatic footage was filmed by a fellow visitor who says she witnessed the latest incident near the world-famous Old Faithful geyser in the park, which straddles the Wyoming-Montana border, here shown in a clip featured on NBC News. It occurred earlier this week and the brief footage shows the huge male bison grazing before suddenly charging \u2013 prompting members of the nearby group to run screaming \u2013 and hitting the girl, flicking her high into the air. The girl, who has not been named but was visiting from Odessa, Florida, with her family, was treated by park emergency medical workers and taken to a park clinic. She was later released. Yellowstone authorities, who are investigating the incident, said the group are thought to have been standing between five and 10 feet from the creature \u2013 much closer than rangers advise \u2013 prompting the bison to charge. In a statement, the park urged visitors to maintain a safe distance from big animals. It read: \u201cWildlife in Yellowstone are wild.

Hailey Dayton, 18, who shot the video while visiting the park during a family road trip, said she saw people \u201cpetting the bison\u201d. She was filming the bull eating when she said it charged at the girl who was walking down a nearby path with her family. \u201cBecause it was agitated by all the people and noise, it just kind of attacked,\u201d she told NBC News. \u201cAfter that, everyone was screaming.

However, the warnings do not seem to pose a sufficient deterrent for photo-hungry visitors. Last June, a woman was gored by a bison after a crowd got too close. Two months later in August there was another bison-related incident at Yellowstone. A \u201cbison jam\u201d almost two miles long resulted in chaos as visitors got out of their cars to take photos of the animals passing them. The rise of social media \u2013 particularly Instagram \u2013 is putting America\u2019s national parks and public land under pressure. Horseshoe Bend, near Page, Arizona, has seen annual visitors soar from 100,000 in 2010 to an estimated 2 million in 2018 and some accidents, prompting the installation of railings last year. Other recent accidents and incidents involving animals and dangerous landscapes in the Grand Canyon, Yosemite national park, the Rocky Mountains and elsewhere have been blamed on risk-taking in a \u201cselfie epidemic\u201d and lack of regard for the land and the wildlife, also amid overcrowding at national parks. In 2016 four men were recorded walking on prohibited land at the Grand Prismatic Spring, also in Yellowstone, dipping their hands in a thermal pool and wake-boarding across the world famous and fragile Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, among other high jinks recorded for the entertainment of online followers.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s elevation to prime minister has been greeted with mixed reactions internationally; while the praise has been enthusiastic from some quarters, including from Donald Trump and far-right world leaders, it has been less than overwhelming from some of his European counterparts. After Trump offered his hearty congratulations , newspapers in the US were far less effusive. The Washington Post said Johnson was \u201cknown for improvisation, inattention to detail and frequent false statements\u201d. While it noted the similarities between Trump and Johnson, it said the new British PM had \u201cmostly avoided Mr Trump\u2019s hateful appeals to racism and ugly disparagement of opponents\u201d offering an \u201cupbeat vision\u201d. The New York Times editorial said \u201cJohnson is about to collide with reality\u201d. Wednesday\u2019s front page described him as an \u201cagitator with an ally in Trump\u201d and said he faces \u201cBrexit strife and Iran unease\u201d. Its editorial said while Johnson was a \u201cmaster of political theatre \u2026 his record as journalist, legislator, London mayor and foreign secretary displays far more bluster than achievement, and a disdain for hard work, probity or the truth\u201d. In Brazil, the country\u2019s authoritarian far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, joined in Trump\u2019s praise, saying Johnson could \u201ccount on Brazil in the pursuit of free trade \u2026 and the defence of freedom and democracy\u201d. The response was diplomatically measured from EU leaders, with Ursula von der Leyen, the president-elect of the EU commission, saying she was \u201clooking forward to having a good working relationship with him\u201d adding there were \u201cchallenging times ahead of us\u201d. At the same press conference, the French president, Emmanuel Macron, said he was \u201clooking forward to working with him very soon\u201d. The front page of the French newspaper Lib\u00e9ration ran the headline: \u201c\u2018Bojo\u2019: the fallout\u201d, saying: \u201cThree years after the vote on Brexit, the extravagant and disturbing Boris Johnson is at the doors of Downing Street.\u201d There was a similar note of disquiet on the front page of the Belgian paper De Morgen on Wednesday, which had the splash: \u201cEU is not afraid of Johnson.\u201d Belgium\u2019s L\u2019Echo paper reported: \u201c100 days of \u2018Bojo\u2019 before a hard Brexit.\u201d Frans Timmermans, the EU commission vice-president accepted that Boris Johnson was \u201ccolourful\u201d but said \u201cthe world\u2019s politics is rife with colour people these days, so if you can\u2019t deal with them there\u2019s not much you can do\u201d. Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigration League and deputy prime minister, joined in the far-right praise of Johnson: \u201cThe fact that on the left they are painting him as \u2018more dangerous than the League\u2019 makes me like him even more.\u201d Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, congratulated Johnson on his new role and said he hoped to sign one of Britain\u2019s first bilateral trade deals after Brexit. Morrison said Johnson \u201chas a reputation for getting things done and making things happen\u201d. Morrison told reporters that \u201cthis is a time of change for the United Kingdom\u201d and Johnson \u201cwill bring a new opportunity ... to resolve what had been some very difficult issues\u201d. The leader of the Australia\u2019s far-right, anti-immigration One Nation party, Pauline Hanson, tweeted that she was \u201cabsolutely thrilled\u201d that Johnson had been made prime minister, adding: \u201cBring on Brexit!\u201d Turkey also responded warmly to Johnson\u2019s victory, largely due to his Turkish heritage, with politicians and media proclaiming that the \u201cOttoman grandson\u201d could strengthen ties between the two countries. \u201cOttoman grandson becomes prime ,inister,\u201d read a front-page headline of the opposition newspaper S\u00f6zc\u00fc. Johnson\u2019s great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, was the Ottoman Empire\u2019s last interior minister, and Johnson\u2019s ancestry has been a source of pride for many Turks, leading some media to refer to him as \u201cBoris the Turk\u201d. Their support has remained undimmed, despite Johnson\u2019s sometimes disparaging remarks about Turkey, including a crude limerick about it president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and demands in 2016 that Britain veto Turkey\u2019s accession to the European Union. Erdo\u011fan congratulated Johnson on Twitter, adding that ties between Turkey and the United Kingdom were set to improve. There was a particularly icy response from the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who sent a strikingly muted letter to Johnson, saying: \u201cIt would be in the interests of our countries and peoples to develop relations in various spheres,\u201d according to a statement from the Kremlin. Ties between the two countries have been particularly strained since the novichok nerve agent poisonings in Salisbury in 2018 that targeted the double-agent Segei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia. The Iranian foreign minister issued congratulations to Johnson in a tweet that also carried a warning about the current standoff over the seizure of oil tankers in the Gulf.",

      "bodyText": "In the same week UK courts declared British arms exports to Saudi Arabia to be unlawful, a large shipment of Australian-built remote weapons systems left Sydney airport. Secret photographs, obtained by Guardian Australia, confirm the identity of the buyers \u2013 the Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates governments, whose forces are currently waging a devastating war in Yemen. Also marked are the suppliers of the equipment, which the manufacturer boasts is \u201csignificantly enhancing lethality\u201d in combat. Labelling on pallets destined in June for Saudi Arabia\u2019s ministry of interior, specifically the general department of arms and explosives, identify the seller as ATK Alliance Techsystems Operations (Orbital ATK), a US-based company which sells the equipment manufactured by an Australian firm, Electro Optics Systems (EOS). The weapons systems shipped to the UAE armed forces\u2019 joint logistics command from Sydney\u2019s international airport were supplied by EOS. The R400s remote weapons station allows small cannons, guns or missile launchers to be mounted on military and light vehicles and operated remotely. There has been long-running concern over arms exports to the Saudi-led coalition of countries waging war in Yemen. The war, which began in 2015, has displaced more than 3million people, brought widespread famine and disease, and is considered the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crisis. Saudi Arabia and its allies have been accused of potential war crimes and multiple atrocities including indiscriminate bombing campaigns. In June new figures estimated around 100,000 people had been killed in the conflict \u2013 including around 11,700 killed in 4,500 events which directly targeted civilians.

The company would not confirm the identity of its buyer, but said none of its products had been deployed in Yemen. In the wake of EOS\u2019s links to the Yemen conflict becoming public, Australia\u2019s superannuation peak body divested from the company, beginning its sell-off in early March and concluding last month. In a letter to NSW Greens MP David Shoebridge, the chair of IFM Investors &amp; Industry Super Australia, Greg Combet, said the organisation wouldn\u2019t comment on individual companies but noted the \u201cceasing\u201d of investment. \u201cIFM invests across a range of asset classes and industry sectors and recognise that our investments are potentially exposed to a range of environmental, social and governance risks factors,\u201d Combet said in the letter. \u201cTo ensure these issues are considered prior to investing, IFM Investors has a robust approach to integrating ESG into our investment decision making process.\u201d Combet said the defence industry in Australia and the US was \u201cextremely stringent\u201d, and the industry was an important part of Australia\u2019s economy. Last month the UK court of appeal found the British government failed to properly assess the risk of misuse, making no assessment of any past pattern of violations by the Saudi-led coalition, when approving exports. Australia defends its exports in a similar fashion, claiming every licence application is assessed to check for risk of the end use breaching human rights and other international obligations. For several months earlier this year the US Congress had been blocking sales of military weapons to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, specifically over concerns about the the civilian casualties in Yemen. In May president Donal Trump defied the block to restart sales. Australian Greens leader, Richard di Natale, said while other countries were banning arms sales to Saudi Arabia \u201cAustralia is continuing to profit off both nations\u2019 warmongering, while remaining tight-lipped or wilfully ignorant about where our weapons are ending up\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s time to end our arms trade with human rights abusers, and rip up the government\u2019s obscene plans to make Australia a global arms dealer.\u201d In February Tom Hamilton, then acting deputy secretary of the defence department\u2019s strategic policy and intelligence group, repeatedly told a Senate estimates hearing that an export licence would not be approved if the weapons were going to be used in Yemen. \u201cIf we assess that they would [to commit human rights abuses], we would not approve the permit,\u201d he said. However the Australian government has admitted that it does not run any checks once the product has left the country. Arms exports from Australia are administered by the Defence Exports Controls Branch of the defence department. Australian defence officials have delegated authority to approve exports by Australian companies, but only the minister can deny them. A spokeswoman for defence said exports were subjected to a rigorous risk assessment process that examines Australia\u2019s international obligations, foreign policy, human rights, national security, and regional security. Defence said it consulted widely on arms exports and carefully considered whether there was a risk of \u201cdiversion\u201d. \u201cAs part of this process, defence assesses export applications to identify whether the export would prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia,\u201d she said. \u201cThis assessment includes consideration of whether there is an overriding risk that the exported items could be used to commit or facilitate a serious violation of international humanitarian law. \u201cAs part of these considerations, defence can require that commitments are made by the end user to not transfer or use the goods and/or technology for other than the original stated purpose without defence\u2019s consent.\u201d Defence said it can revoke permits or approach the foreign government if arms are diverted from their intended purpose. Freedom of information documents released last year were extensively redacted but revealed lengthy internal discussions of a company\u2019s request to export remote weapons systems. Defence recommended approval as it was \u201cunlikely to be used in contravention of human rights law or international humanitarian law\u201d. Applications are assessed against five criteria: international obligations, human rights, national security, regional security, and foreign policy. The language of the criteria is not explicit. Three of the criteria call for the assessors to consider just whether the weapon \u201cmight\u201d be used in a way that breaches obligations. Only the human rights and foreign policy criteria call for explicitly identifiable risks. The newly-formed Australian Arms Control Coalition, a collection of civil society groups, said the images raised a \u201cwhole range of questions\u201d about what was being done with Australian arms, and what checks and balances were in place to prevent them being used in human rights abuses. Kellie Tranter, a lawyer with the coalition, said the lack of guarantees that arms wouldn\u2019t be used in humanitarian law violations was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cAustralians should know who their government is sending arms to and how those arms are being used, and they should have concrete guarantees that those arms won\u2019t be used to commit or facilitate violations of international humanitarian law (IHL) or international human rights law,\u201d Tranter said. She said the UK court\u2019s decision to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia also raised \u201cthe possibility\u201d that Australia was also failing to conduct proper due diligence on where its arms were ending up. The Arms Control Coalition\u2019s chair and Save the Children campaigner, Joe Rafalowicz, said Australia could no longer turn a blind eye to the role foreign weapons were playing in the war in Yemen. \u201cIt is unthinkable that Australian made defence exports could be helping fuel abuses in the war in Yemen, which has left more than 22 million people in need of life-saving humanitarian assistance, while some 85,000 children have died from the effects of war including starvation,\u201d he said.

It was she who steered us away from meat and three veg, urging Australian housewives to be bold and try new things.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/jul/24/open-thread-what-did-margaret-fulton-teach-you-about-cooking\">Open thread: what did Margaret Fulton teach you about cooking?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cShe has guided generations through the kitchen,\u201d Santich says.</p> <p>She describes Fulton as \u201cmodest\u201d, \u201cmeticulous\u201d and \u201cethical\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe realised that she was recognised as an authority and she made sure she met those standards.\u201d .</p> <p>Born in Scotland in 1924, Fulton and moved to Australia with her family when she was three. She began her career as a cooking teacher and is often credited with introducing Australians to the pressure cooker, but it was her 1968 book The Margaret Fulton Cookbook that really put her on the map.</p> <p>Looking at the book today, it\u2019s hard not to giggle at the nostalgic recipes and photos. My 1974 edition contains imperial measurements and a helpful laminated \u201cmetric conversion guide\u201d. Flipping through to the dessert section, I\u2019m alarmed by a recipe for \u201corange sherbet\u201d. The ingredients include oranges, gelatine, milk, salt, sugar and lemon juice.</p> <p>Pages 126 and 127 shows a step-by-step guide of how to eat spaghetti, complete with black and white photos. There are also instructions for how to cook rice.</p> <p>Santich explains that we must see the seminal book as a product of the time \u2013 and be clear about how revolutionary it was. Mixing familiar recipes with the unfamiliar was a stroke of genius, she says.</p> <p>\u201cIn the 50s people from other countries started coming to Australia \u2013 there was a certain level of resistance to them and to their food. With Margaret introducing it and integrating it with what they [Australians] did know, it contributed to integrating those other cultures into Australia.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"12bcdbdd033e7f2f487f97a84b9a8e4f69a89bc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/12bcdbdd033e7f2f487f97a84b9a8e4f69a89bc0/0_205_2829_3633/779.jpg\" alt=\"Spaghetti with meatballs, from The Margaret Fulton Cookbook\" width=\"779\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spaghetti with meatballs, from The Margaret Fulton Cookbook</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Margaret Fulton Cookbook.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Blake Singley has researched and written on the history of Australian cookbooks for almost a decade.

      "bodyText": "\u201cShe wasn\u2019t just a cook. She was a journalist and entrepreneur.\u201d The food historian Barbara Santich, who worked with Margaret Fulton in the mid-1970s,at Women\u2019s Day, and again in the 80s, says the influence of the Australian cooking pioneer, who died on Wednesday, went far beyond her skills in the kitchen. \u201cShe was an extraordinary communicator,\u201d Santich says. \u201cShe knew how to talk to people through her writing.\u201d These days celebrity chefs and food commentators are a dime a dozen. But Fulton was the first. It was she who steered us away from meat and three veg, urging Australian housewives to be bold and try new things. \u201cShe has guided generations through the kitchen,\u201d Santich says. She describes Fulton as \u201cmodest\u201d, \u201cmeticulous\u201d and \u201cethical\u201d. \u201cShe realised that she was recognised as an authority and she made sure she met those standards.\u201d . Born in Scotland in 1924, Fulton and moved to Australia with her family when she was three. She began her career as a cooking teacher and is often credited with introducing Australians to the pressure cooker, but it was her 1968 book The Margaret Fulton Cookbook that really put her on the map. Looking at the book today, it\u2019s hard not to giggle at the nostalgic recipes and photos. My 1974 edition contains imperial measurements and a helpful laminated \u201cmetric conversion guide\u201d. Flipping through to the dessert section, I\u2019m alarmed by a recipe for \u201corange sherbet\u201d. The ingredients include oranges, gelatine, milk, salt, sugar and lemon juice. Pages 126 and 127 shows a step-by-step guide of how to eat spaghetti, complete with black and white photos. There are also instructions for how to cook rice. Santich explains that we must see the seminal book as a product of the time \u2013 and be clear about how revolutionary it was. Mixing familiar recipes with the unfamiliar was a stroke of genius, she says. \u201cIn the 50s people from other countries started coming to Australia \u2013 there was a certain level of resistance to them and to their food. With Margaret introducing it and integrating it with what they [Australians] did know, it contributed to integrating those other cultures into Australia.\u201d Blake Singley has researched and written on the history of Australian cookbooks for almost a decade. He agrees Fulton changed the culture: \u201cMargaret Fulton\u2019s impact on the Australian culinary landscape cannot be overestimated \u2026 The Margaret Fulton Cookbook holds a special place in the hearts of many Australians who grew up in the 1970s and 80s \u2013 it brings back memories of family and home.\u201d He believes it wasn\u2019t just overseas arrivals who shifted our culinary interests.

But Santich stresses they have to be understood in the context of the times. \u201cI think with the colour photography [of] food, Australia was leading the way worldwide,\u201d she says. Before Fulton\u2019s 1968 classic was released, cookbooks were mainly text \u201cand if they did have photos, they were black and white\u201d. Fulton always had firm ideas of what she wanted, brought in all the props and directed all the photoshoots, she says. Colour images \u201chelped people see something as it would appear on the table, so that you could see \u2026 the way the colours work together\u201d, Santich says. Despite the many international cuisines that influenced Fulton\u2019s recipes, her Scottish heritage stayed with her. Santich recalls Fulton\u2019s passion for Dundee cake \u2013 a traditional fruitcake with a lemon twist. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a year when Dundee cake didn\u2019t appear in Women\u2019s Day in one context or another \u2026 That\u2019s something that I always associate with her.\u201d \u2022 Ginger Gorman is an award-winning print and radio journalist",

      "bodyText": "The Northern Territory\u2019s criminal lawyers will lodge a formal complaint about a judge who told an Indigenous mother she probably got drunk on pension day and \u201cabandoned your kids in that great Indigenous fashion\u201d. Last week Guardian Australia revealed a series of remarks made by a local court judge, Greg Borchers, in hearings across central Australia. He told a woman who breached an order prohibiting alcohol consumption that she had \u201cprobably\u201d got her pension money, got drunk, and abandoned her children to relatives in that \u201cgreat Indigenous fashion\u201d. Borchers also likened an Indigenous domestic violence offender to a \u201cprimitive person dragging his woman out of the cage\u201d and, in a separate case, wondered aloud whether one day \u201csome important anthropological literature\u201d would help explain \u201cIndigenous laissez-faire parenting\u201d and \u201cwhy it is that people abandon their children on such a regular basis\u201d. The judge has previously been reprimanded for inappropriate comments. In 2017 he was removed from the Alice Springs youth court after an investigation by the chief judge, John Lowndes. The Criminal Lawyers Association of the Northern Territory met on Wednesday night to consider Borchers\u2019 latest conduct. It resolved to make a formal complaint to the chief judge, likely to spark the second investigation of Borchers in as many years. Its president, Marty Aust, told Guardian Australia the association was drafting its complaint and would on Thursday submit it to the chief judge and share it with the territory\u2019s legal fraternity. \u201cLast night the Criminal Lawyers Association committee met, we reviewed the material that had come into our possession and we determined that complaints were warranted,\u201d Aust said. \u201cWe have drafted or are finalising a draft of particularised complaints, and that will be sent to the chief judge of the local court today \u2026 we expect that the complaint will require investigation, we can\u2019t speak any further on the nature of the complaint, because that might lead to prejudicial outcomes.\u201d The association is frustrated that the issue was ventilated in the public, rather than through official internal channels. Aust told Guardian Australia it showed the urgent need for a judicial complaints commission in the NT. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cThe way in which this matter has come [to be] in the public sphere is particularly worrisome and what we want is for the NT government that the time is here to pass legislation that enacts an independent judicial commission or a structure for the investigation of complaints against judicial officers,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd also what is particularly disappointing is that there is already a framework that has been provided to the attorney general that has been signed off upon by the entire profession. \u201cIt\u2019s been sitting there for well over 18 months. If they can pass punitive retrospective laws that discriminate against Aboriginal children in custody under urgency, they should be able to pass legislation that is for the betterment of the profession that everyone agrees with in a shortshrift manner.\u201d Borchers was previously approached for comment through the Department of Attorney General and Justice, which said judges do not publicly comment on their decisions or deliberations. Complaints against judges are generally treated as confidential by the court.",

Police have now laid the first charges in the case against Bryer Schmegelsky and fellow suspect Kam McLeod, 19, who are the subjects of a nationwide manhunt. The pair have each been charged with one count of second-degree murder in the death of Leonard \u201cLen\u201d Dyck, 64, of Vancouver. Warrants are out for their arrest. They are suspects in the murders of Fowler and Deese, although no charges have been laid in those deaths. On 15 July the young couple were found shot by the side of the same remote road where Dyck was discovered four days later. The cases, which are hundreds of kilometres apart, were originally not considered to be linked. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) announced a possible connection on Monday. Until Wednesday, Dyck had gone unidentified as the man whose body was found on 19 July, two kilometres from the burned-out remains of the truck McLeod and Schmegelsky were travelling in. \u201cHe was a loving husband and father,\u201d Dyck\u2019s family said in a statement provided by the RCMP. \u201cHis death has created unthinkable grief and we are struggling to understand what happened.\u201d McLeod\u2019s father, Keith McLeod, also released a statement about the compassionate nature of his son. \u201cThis is what I do know \u2013 Kam is a kind, considerate, caring young man,\u201d McLeod wrote. McLeod and Schmegelsky are childhood friends from the small town of Port Alberni on Vancouver Island, and had reportedly worked together at the local Walmart to save up money for their trip off-island. According to Schmegelsky\u2019s grandmother Carol Starkey, the pair had left Port Alberni on 12 July in order to find work in the Yukon, reported a Vancouver Island newspaper. Schmegelsky and McLeod are still at large. Police discovered the burned-out remains of a vehicle the suspects were traveling in nearly 3,000km (1,864 miles) from the scene of the murder. The vehicle was found near the town of Gillam, Manitoba, and was only confirmed to belong to the pair on Wednesday. The pair are considered dangerous; the RCMP has warned anyone who spots them to call 911 and not approach. As the week has gone on, details have emerged about Schmegelsky that raise questions about the boys, who were originally considered missing persons rather than suspects. On Wednesday, the Globe and Mail published photographs showing Schmegelsky wearing a gas mask and army fatigues, as well as a photograph of a Nazi knife and armband allegedly owned by Schmegelsky. The photographs were provided by an online acquaintance, the newspaper reported. It remains unclear if and when McLeod and Schmegelsky came into contact with Fowler and Deese, and police have yet to make any link between the couple\u2019s death and the discovery of a Dyck\u2019s body 500km to the south, near the town of Dease Lake. The violent crimes have unnerved remote communities in the northern Canadian prairies \u2013 many of which have little police presence. Gillam, which is considered populous for the area, had just 1,265 residents at the time of the 2016 national census, spread out over the town\u2019s large 2,000 sq km area. Limited roadways in and out of the community and few gas stations would make it difficult for the two fugitives to avoid detection. \u201cWe\u2019re as far north as you can go by road,\u201d Gillam Mayor Dwayne Forman told a British Columbia radio station. \u201cEverybody in town knows everybody.\u201d A new face would be easy to spot, he said: \u201cEven the RCMP, I can tell they\u2019re not our normal contingency members driving around the town.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 26 July 2019 because the murders didn\u2019t happen on the same highway as an earlier version said.",

      "bodyText": "The corporate regulator is to launch legal action against ANZ over an alleged fee rip-off that could result in the bank being forced to pay a penalty running into the hundreds of millions of dollars. An Australian Securities and Investments Commission spokesman said on Thursday the regulator was \u201cintending to issue proceedings in the federal court against ANZ today\u201d over the alleged misconduct, which relates to the bank charging fees to customers who moved money between their own accounts. ANZ told the stock exchange it understood that \u201cAsic will seek pecuniary penalties in respect of 1.3m occasions where the fees were applied\u201d. It is believed Asic will accuse the bank of breaches of the law including misleading and deceptive conduct, unconscionable conduct and making false or misleading representations to customers. These breaches attract maximum penalties of between $1.7m and $2.1m per contravention, implying a total penalty for the bank of in excess of $2tn if Asic succeeds. However, a court is unlikely to apply the maximum possible penalty, meaning a total running into the tens or hundreds of millions is far more likely. Asic is also expected to accuse ANZ of breaching its core obligations under its financial services licences to deal with customers \u201cefficiently, honestly and fairly\u201d. However, it will be unable to ask the court for a fine to be imposed for this alleged breach because the fees were charged before changes to the law in February that beefed up penalties. \u201cWhile ANZ is still considering the matters raised by Asic, ANZ categorically denies any deliberate wrongdoing and intends to vigorously defend any such allegation,\u201d the bank told the ASX. Before February 2016, ANZ charged customers a fee to set up regular payments from one of their accounts to another. It also charged customers a dishonour fee when there was not enough money in their account to make the scheduled payment. The periodical payment fees were also part of a landmark class action lawsuit over bank fees run by law firm Maurice Blackburn in which it was alleged they were not allowed by ANZ\u2019s contracts with its customers. While the class action was largely unsuccessful, the periodical payment fees were carved out and in December ANZ agreed to pay $1.5m to settle the case. Separately, in September 2016 ANZ struck a deal with Asic to pay almost 400,000 customers $28.8m to compensate them for paying the fees. At the time, ANZ said it had \u201cproactively reported this matter to Asic\u201d. On Thursday morning the bank told the market the compensation figure had now blown out to $50m.",

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all for now. Thanks for following along with us and be sure to check back later for a full match report. There\u2019s the final whistle and Liverpool and Sporting Lisbon will share the Western Union Cup before 31,112 mostly red-clad fans at Yankee Stadium! 90 min: Three minutes of added time, says the fourth official. 89 min: Sepp van den Berg, all of 17 years old and wearing the No 72 shirt, replaces Matip to make his first appearance for Liverpool. 88 min: Fabinho is shown yellow for a rough challenge. 86 min: Liverpool have struggled to keep possession over the last five minutes, but Sporting haven\u2019t generated much in the way of chances over that span. It\u2019s petered out a bit to be honest. 83 min: A couple for switches for Sporting: Eduardo Quaresma, Gonzalo Plata, Daniel Bragan\u00e7a and Eduardo are on to replace Ilori, Raphinha, Wendel and the brilliant Bruno Fernandes. 81 min: Sneaky run by Milner up the left flank but his volley off a Fabinho cross deflects off a Sporting defender and out for a corner. 76 min: More substitutions for both sides for the final quarter hour. For Liverpool, it\u2019s Brewster, Jones, Lovren and Lallana come on for Origi, Van Dijk, Henderson and Wijnaldum. For Sporting, Nuno Mendes and Miguel Lu\u00eds enter for Mathieu and Doumbia. 72 min: Tonight\u2019s official attendance is 31,112. 69 min: A mistake in the Liverpool midfield leads to a 2v2 break and a chance for Sporting, but Mignolet is there to save Belloli\u2019s low shot to the far post. 65 min: Rollicking atmosphere here in the Bronx as a slow patch of action on the pitch is peppered with songs and chants throughout the packed crowd. We\u2019ve received a number of queries about the format for tonight\u2019s, er, cup final. If the score is level after 90 minutes, there will be no extra time and no penalty shootout. 61 min: Waves of substitutions from both sides at the hour mark. Harry Wilson, Joe Gomez, Ryan Kent replace Oxlade-Chamberlain, Robertson and Alexander-Arnold for Liverpool. For Sporting Lisbon, it\u2019s Coates, Dost and Jovane coming on for Neto, Luiz Phellype and Vietto. 57 min: Neto, who\u2019s on a yellow, makes a harsh challenge on Wijnaldum, who wins a free kick from a dangerous spot on the side of the box. Milner takes it, swinging it in with pace and it takes a deflection ... but just shoots wide of the far post for a corner. Alexander-Arnold\u2019s attempt finds Van Dijk on the far post ... he heads it down but he\u2019s denied by the post. Unlucky! Bruno Fernandes accelerates down the left flank, cuts back and slides it to Wendel in the middle of the area and he coolly finishes from seven yards past an outstretched Mignolet. 50 min: A good, patient spell of possession here for Sporting Lisbon in the final third results in a corner. Wendel\u2019s offering played short to Hernandes, but he\u2019s dispossessed by Wijnaldum and it\u2019s cleared. 49 min: Bruno Fernandes has another go from distance from the top of the circle but it skids just wide right of the target. The Sporting captain has been at the heart of everything for his side tonight. 48 min: Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner is cleared and it falls on the break for Sporting, but Mignolet comes out of his box and clears an overcooked through pass from danger. 47 min: Van Dijk lets it rip from 30 yards and it sails about 20 feet over the goal into the seats along the first baseline. Optimistic. 46 min: And we\u2019re off in the second half! This match is, in fact, for a trophy. Something called the Western Union Cup. Unclear what it\u2019s made of but we\u2019re told it\u2019s much lighter than Old Big Ears. And unlike many of these pre-season affairs on American soil (including last night\u2019s), tonight\u2019s match will not be settled by penalties if were drawn after 90 minutes. That means Liverpool and Sporting will have to do with sharing it for the next year. Luciano Vietto\u2019s header at the death gives Liverpool a scare, but Mignolet makes a brilliant save and there\u2019s the whistle for the half. 45 min: The fourth official signals for one minute of added time. As I was just saying ... Wijnaldum, who\u2019s been a handful for the Sporting back four all night, capitalizes on a mistake by Neto, who badly misjudges Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s cross, and calmly finishes. 43 min: Liverpool finishing the half strong here, keeping Sporting on the back foot even if they don\u2019t have a second goal to show for it. 41 min: Oxlade-Chamberlain\u2019s cross from the edge of the box nearly finds the head of Wijnaldum, but it\u2019s cleared by a Sporting defender amid oohs from the crowd. 35 min: Marcus Wendel sells Fabingo on the dummy, buys himself some space and rips a shot off the post, which nearly hits Mignolet on the rebound and goes in the goal but luckily rolls the other way and out for a corner. Moments later Bruno Fernandes\u2019s attempt is nearly converted but is sent out for a goal kick. A dangerous spell for Sporting at the moment. 33 min: Fabinho is whistled for an overzealous challenge on Bruno Fernandes and the goalscorer will look to notch a second from a dangerous area ... but this time his shot is off target. 30 min: Lu\u00eds Neto is shown yellow for a tardy, two-footed challenge on Wijnaldum. 28 min: Moments after a Sporting Lisbon chance, Liverpool are quick to counter and a Milner cross toward the edge of the area finds Robertson, who uncorks a thunderbolt that sails a couple of feet over the crossbar. 22 min: Word is fans are still queued up to get into the stadium thanks to an undermanned security detail, but the stands at Yankee Stadium are nearly full by now apart from the closed-off mezzanine with a rollicking atmosphere to match. Roberton\u2019s nifty cross to the head of Henderson is saved, but Origi is there to poke in the rebound from point-blank range and Liverpool are level in the Bronx! 18 min: Liverpool have done well to recover after that early surprise, keeping possession, winning a few corners and creating a steady string of chances. Another corner from Trent Alexander-Arnold just now finds the head of Van Dijk in the center of the area and his header demands a highlight-reel save from Renan Ribeiro. 12 min: Liverpool win another corner when a well-timed tackle by Tiago Ilori on Oxlade-Chamberlain puts it out past the goal line. It\u2019s whipped in by Alexander-Arnold and Matip\u2019s header clangs off the woodwork! But it wouldn\u2019t have counted with the referee whistling for a foul. 10 min: A sharply hit shot by Origi is cleared past the goal line by a Sporting defender for another Liverpool corner, but it\u2019s cleared easily. 9 min: A patient build-up by Liverpool ends with their first corner of the match after a Wijnaldum shot caroms out. Alas, nothing comes of it and it\u2019s cleared past the halfway line. Well. After a bit of a meandering start for both sides, Bruno Fernandes hits from 30 yards out, a speculative shot with a bit of movement, and it clangs off Mignolet\u2019s hands and spins into the goal. Yikes on bikes! A freak goal if ever there was one. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Liverpool attacking from right to left as they debut their new away kit, Sporting CP in navy blue and green strips. The players have exited the tunnel. They\u2019ve stood for the Star-Spangled Banner. There\u2019s been an abbreviated rendition of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. And we\u2019ll be under way momentarily ... We\u2019re about five minutes from kickoff and we\u2019ve just been handed an updated team sheet. Luiz Phellype gets moved into the XI for Sporting Lisbon in place of Miguel Lu\u00eds. Hello and welcome to Yankee Stadium for tonight\u2019s friendly between Liverpool and Sporting Lisbon. The six-time European champions are here in the Bronx and looking to end their pre-season tour of America on a high note after Saturday\u2019s 3-2 loss to Dortmund at Notre Dame Stadium and Sunday\u2019s 2-1 defeat to Sevilla at Fenway Park.

Independent booksellers have disappeared from the city, before reappearing in mainland China facing charges.</p>\n    <p>Under the terms of the agreement by which the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997, the semi-autonomous region was meant to maintain a \u201chigh degree of autonomy\u201d through an independent judiciary, a free press and an open market economy, a framework known as \u201cone country, two systems\u201d.</p>\n    <p>The extradition bill was seen as an attempt to undermine this and to give Beijing the ability to try pro-democracy activists under the judicial system of the mainland.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>How have the authorities responded?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Beijing has issued increasingly shrill condemnations but has left it to the city's semi-autonomous government to deal with the situation. Meanwhile police have violently clashed directly with protesters, repeatedly firing teargas and rubber bullets.</p>\n    <p>Beijing has ramped up its accusations that foreign countries are \u201cfanning the fire\u201d of unrest in the city. China\u2019s top diplomat Yang Jiechi has ordered the US to \u201cimmediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs in any form\u201d.</p>\n    <p><b><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lily-kuo\">Lily Kuo</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/verna-yu\">Verna Yu</a> in Hong Kong</b></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Mei, who runs a noodle restaurant near the train station, had reopened its doors on Tuesday.

The trailer gives little of the plot away, but shows Jojo being bullied at what looks like a summer camp for Hitler Youth, before confiding in his imaginary friend, a rather paunchy and particularly un-self-aware Hitler, who pops out from behind a tree. \u201cThey called me a scared rabbit,\u201d Jojo says. \u201cLet them say whatever they want,\u201d Waititi\u2019s Hitler replies. \u201cPeople used to say a lot of nasty things about me. \u2018Oh this guy\u2019s a lunatic. Oh look at that psycho, he\u2019s gonna get us all killed.\u2019\u201d Waititi, who is known for bringing comedy with depth to difficult subjects, confirmed last week that he would return to the apparently infinite Marvel Cinematic Universe to direct the fourth Thor film, and his second. Jojo Rabbit will premiere at the Toronto film festival and is due for general release on 18 October.",

      "bodyText": "Joseph Heller was very particular about what is, and what is not, a catch-22 situation. He insisted it must be \u201cperfectly, cruelly illogical, with life-or-death peril\u201d. Moz Azimi has a good case to argue that he fits those criteria. The young Kurdish man who spent nearly six years on Manus Island was on track to be accepted for resettlement by the US. He was brought to Port Moresby for his first interview, where the US insists the process must be carried out. For reasons Azimi doesn\u2019t understand, they said he had to go back to Manus before they would let him be brought back for the second interview. But he was so traumatised by what he had experienced there that he could not endure returning. As a result he lives in limbo in Moresby, taken in by a sympathetic local family, with few other means of support. He must be interviewed in the Papua New Guinea capital to have a chance of escape, but it cannot happen unless he returns to Manus Island first. Azimi is one of many individuals caught up in Australia\u2019s offshore processing network whose lives are on hold thanks to \u201cperfectly, cruelly illogical\u201d circumstances. They include a refugee who wants to live on Manus Island, but can\u2019t, and another who has permission to go to the US, but doesn\u2019t want to leave his disabled toddler, from his marriage with a Manusian woman. \u2018I have nightmares every night\u2019 Moz Azimi lives in Port Moresby now. \u201cThey called me a few times but I didn\u2019t accept their offer to go back,\u201d he says of the US assessors. \u201cI cannot stay in detention. Because I was traumatised terribly when I was on Manus.\u201d Down one of the city\u2019s suburban backstreets, the young Kurdish man lives with a Papua New Guinean family who have taken him in as one of their own. \u201cA pastor introduced me to them and I paid for a few months because they didn\u2019t know me,\u201d he says. \u201c[But then] I didn\u2019t have any money and I packed my stuff and talked with \u2013 I call her Mum \u2013 and said I should go \u2026 back to Manus. And all of them came around me and said we will never let you go back to Manus. \u201cI just cried. They said you brought a smile to our family.\u201d Azimi, who has been in Papua New Guinea for more than six years now, says he was hit with a metal pole by a PNG officer when authorities forcibly emptied the detention centre at the end of 2017\u2019s 24-day standoff. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a lot from that time. When they moved us forcibly to East Lorengau, after a few days I got a stammer,\u201d he says. Azimi became close friends with an Australian advocate, Christina Combe, who passed away earlier this year, and who also supported him when he decided to stay in Port Moresby. \u201cWhen I was listening to her voice I felt I was very lucky.\u201d Azimi sits in his room upstairs at the family\u2019s small motel. His belongings are neatly stacked around the edges of the wall, and a guitar sits on the bed. On a small table is a framed photo of Combes. \u201cWhen I play music it helps me to not harm myself or think about many terrible things. I have nightmares every night, but I think playing guitar is helping.\u201d Because he refused to return to Manus Island, Azimi says he was cut off from the financial and medical support provided to refugees. Now he lives a largely anonymous life in the Port Moresby community, but isn\u2019t legally able to work, and struggles to afford healthcare. \u201cI think I cannot go to other provinces [either], and if I go to the airport I think they will arrest me,\u201d he says. For now he says he has accepted this is his life. If he won\u2019t go back to Manus Island he can\u2019t continue the process for US resettlement and is destined to eke out an existence in Port Moresby. \u2018They\u2019re just kids. They\u2019re innocent\u2019 Iranian refugee Paul Papi is leaving PNG for the US, but wants to take his son with him. Guardian Australia meets Papi shortly after church, at the Lodge 10 hotel in a leafy part of Boroko, Port Moresby. No one is allowed guests in their room so we sit on a small leather sofa, behind a dividing wall and in earshot of Paladin guards. A former Sunni Muslim and now devout Christian convert, Papi is dressed in a shirt and tie, a small manicured beard and grey hair belying his 38 years. He carries Cyrus, his \u201csunny boy\u201d, who is 13 months old, and not yet walking or even crawling. Papi met his wife on Manus Island, like dozens of his fellow detainees. He and Judith had Cyrus and moved to Port Moresby. Then they learned he had disabilities. Medical documents seen by Guardian Australia say Cyrus has suspected clubfoot, and Erb\u2019s palsy in his left arm. \u201cIt\u2019s his bone, it\u2019s twisted,\u201d says Papi. \u201cBut the doctors here can\u2019t do anything, just support his leg ... Nothing else. I don\u2019t know [if surgery can fix it]. He needs to go to Australia or another country because of his problems.\u201d Papi takes off the brace bandages to show Cyrus\u2019s hand and foot. The toddler giggles and grabs at his father\u2019s dangling tie. He\u2019s happy now, but Papi thinks his son is in pain. Refugees at Lodge 10 are waiting to go to the US for permanent resettlement, a process which can take months from when they are first told they\u2019ve been accepted. Papi is at the end of that process and is expecting to go to the US any day. He says he was \u201cproud\u201d to be going to the US but doesn\u2019t want to leave until he knows that Cyrus can either come with him or get medical treatment in Australia. \u201cI have been to the [local] hospital, the one at PIH,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they said they are not caring for the refugees\u2019 kids, just the refugees. They\u2019re just kids. They\u2019re innocent. I made a mistake but he didn\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d Cyrus\u2019s mother, Judith, says she would like to follow her husband and child to another country, but failing that, she wants them both to go. Judith has signed an affidavit to say as much. \u201cI\u2019m not worried about me, I\u2019m worried about my son because he\u2019s got a big problem with his bones,\u201d she says later. \u201cI want him to be fine, well. I know that my husband can take him to Australia or USA and they can operate on his bones. I want my son to walk and stand and crawl, because now he can\u2019t.\u201d Judith, who speaks with Guardian Australia via videolink assisted with some translations by Papi, says she met her husband four years ago on Manus Island. \u201cI trust him and I know him very well, that he can look after my son,\u201d she says. \u201cHe can give a good future to my son. He also protects my son, not like my family do.\u201d She says she won\u2019t go back to Manus Island even if Papi and Cyrus leave because her family mistreated her. The US state department told Guardian Australia a refugee can file a \u201cfollow to join\u201d petition to have a family member resettled with them after they arrive, but the process can take months. \u2018It\u2019s so difficult to have a child with no father\u2019 The cases of refugee men who have met local women and had children has caused issues on multiple fronts. The number of children born to these relationships isn\u2019t clear, and reported to be anywhere between seven and 39. The PNG authorities have also been slow at providing adequate documentation for the children, prompting concerns over their future rights as citizens. And some members of the Manus community have said the relationships have \u201cdestroyed\u201d the fabric of the remote and traditional community, especially in the cases where the father has left. While a handful of the fathers remain in Papua New Guinea, many have gone, leaving their wives and children behind. Helal Uddin didn\u2019t want to leave PNG. The Bangladeshi asylum seeker made headlines in 2018 after he was deported back home only to smuggle his way back to PNG, to reunite with his wife, Alice Michael, and their young son, Mohammad. Now two, Mohammad fidgets as he clings to his mother, sitting under shelter in a crude outdoor kitchen behind her family\u2019s small shop in Lorengau, Manus Island. \u201cMohammad likes dancing and playing a lot, he can\u2019t stay quiet,\u201d she says, laughing. On cue, the young boy starts dancing around the benchtop, giggling. \u201cHe knows his dad,\u201d Michael says. \u201cWhen we call to talk to his dad [about] what he\u2019s eating, he tells his dad everything. When people asked him where is your dad, he used to tell them, my dad is in jail.\u201d The couple met when Michael was working in a nearby shop which has since burned down. They married and she says the community didn\u2019t treat her husband as an outsider. \u201cThen when I got pregnant with this little boy I went back to [my] island, but he called me to come back so we lived together,\u201d she says. But one day Uddin came and told her he had to go. \u201cHe said they\u2019ve come and told him they\u2019re bringing him back,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThey put him in the cell and the next day took him to the airport.\u201d Some months later Uddin found his way back to them, by boat from Indonesia. Michael met him in a neighbouring province and they returned to her home island. But he was discovered and jailed in Port Moresby\u2019s Bomana prison. Michael tears up and says she doesn\u2019t get to see Uddin but she does speak to him most days. \u201cHelal is good, whatever he says he will do he will do it, he never lies,\u201d says Michael. \u201cI would like [people] to understand that it\u2019s so difficult to have a child with no father \u2026 I want Mohammad\u2019s dad to stay with us so he can help with the looking after of Mohammad.\u201d Uddin has pleaded guilty to illegally entering PNG, and paid a 2,000 kina fine. He has served more than the three months handed down, but remains at Bomana because there is no immigration accomodation available, his lawyer Agnes Peter says. Peter says Uddin will likely be sent back to Bangladesh but is confident he\u2019ll be allowed to return on a working resident visa. It\u2019s the visa he should have gone for previously, on the basis of his Lorengau shop, she says. He can\u2019t apply from within PNG. They are now organising paperwork with PNG business authorities, and Peter says she has been told by immigration department officers that they see no reason why they wouldn\u2019t approve his application. \u2026 Of the thousands of people Australia sent to Manus Island under its six-year-long offshore processing regime, the few who are left \u2013 like Azimi, Papi and Uddin \u2013 are complex cases in ways likely never envisioned by the scheme\u2019s architects. Australia\u2019s Coalition government maintains that the hundreds of people brought to Australia for medical reasons will be sent back to Manus Island and Nauru, but it also refuses to accept a longstanding offer from New Zealand to resettle 150 refugees annually. At least one government MP has publicly opposed this stance. There is no apparent solution to return those who have not been found to be refugees but who refuse to be sent back to their country of origin. Iran, for example, will not take involuntary returns of its citizens. The US will not reach the threshold of 1,250 resettlement offers it offered, and there is no other third-country option on the horizon despite years of searching. As the Australian government faces increasing pressure to end the system, it\u2019s also becoming increasingly apparent that the system was implemented without a complete exit plan.",

      "bodyText": "The fate of Puerto Rico\u2019s besieged governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, hung in the balance on Wednesday evening as the US territory\u2019s legislature threatened impeachment proceedings if the governor did not resign. Mass demonstrations on the island are approaching their second week, as local press reports on Tuesday evening indicated the governor would resign by midday on Wednesday. But the governor\u2019s resignation did not manifest by the afternoon and the administration later issued a release stating Rossell\u00f3 was \u201cin a process of reflection and of listening to the people\u201d. During chaotic scenes at the governor\u2019s residence in San Juan, reporters were held for hours waiting for an announcement, only to be told by the governor\u2019s director of public affairs that Rossell\u00f3 would issue an address later in the evening. Rossell\u00f3 has been largely abandoned by his own party, the ruling New Progressive party, in the wake of a scandal involving hundreds of pages of leaked text messages shared between the governor and 11 members of his inner circle. The messages contained a slew of homophobic and misogynistic messages as a well as a joke about deaths during Hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in 2017. On Wednesday, local reports indicated that the president of Puerto Rico\u2019s house of representatives, Carlos \u201cJohnny\u201d M\u00e9ndez, would convene a special session of the island\u2019s legislature on Thursday afternoon to initiate impeachment proceedings against the governor. \u201cThe impeachment process has started,\u201d said Mendez, who is a member of Rossell\u00f3\u2019s party in an afternoon press conference. The news followed an announcement that a group of attorneys commissioned by the legislature to examine Rossell\u00f3\u2019s conduct had unanimously found five offenses, some related to embezzlement, that constituted grounds for impeachment. M\u00e9ndez said that even if the governor resigned, the lawyers\u2019 findings would still be passed to relevant authorities. Thousands of protesters had again assembled outside the governor\u2019s residence in San Juan on Wednesday evening as police stood behind makeshift barriers made of concrete. The text message scandal engulfing the governor has drawn bipartisan outrage on the island and led to hundreds of thousands marching on the streets. On Monday, a general strike on the island led to the shutdown of a major highway in San Juan. The governor has attempted to cling to power throughout the demonstrations, which have often been dispersed by police with teargas and rubber bullets, but his position has looked increasingly untenable in recent days. The Rossell\u00f3 administration has been plagued by corruption and allegations of mismanagement during the response to Hurricane Maria. Shortly before the messages were leaked, the FBI arrested five former government officials and contractors accused of misappropriating millions of dollars in federal funds given to the island after Maria. Although the Trump administration has stopped short of calling for Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation, the president has frequently criticised the governor and lied about the federal government\u2019s checkered record in assisting after the hurricane.",

Fowles was reportedly trying to get access to his luggage to make a 9am flight back to Melbourne. The photo posted on Twitter by Sloane, a former journalist, showed a door smashed through, with luggage behind it. Police were called to the scene just before 8am, and Fowles was questioned.

Liberal MP Tim Smith has called on Andrews to answer questions on whether Fowles will be sacked from Labor caucus. The first-term MP for Burwood won his seat when the Andrews government was re-elected in a landslide in 2018.

HBO\u2019s programming chief, Casey Bloys, said on Wednesday there was no serious consideration for remaking the story that some viewers and critics called disappointing. The eighth and final season of the hit show, which wrapped in April, was met with outrage by many viewers who complained of rushed episodes, implausible plot twists, and an apparent disdain for characters of color. A petition demanding that HBO remake the season \u201cwith competent writers\u201d posted on Change.org has attracted more than 1.6m signatures and counting. There are few downsides to having a hugely popular show like Game of Thrones, Bloys said, but one is that fans have strong opinions on what would be a satisfying conclusion. Bloys said during a TV critics\u2019 meeting that it came with the territory, adding that he appreciated fans\u2019 passion for the saga based on George RR Martin\u2019s novels. Emmy voters proved unswayed by petitioners demanding a remake: they gave Game of Thrones a record-breaking 32 nominations earlier this month. The series also brought record viewership for the network, with the series finale becoming the most watched episode in HBO\u2019s history, according to analytics. HBO will want to keep the fan fervor alive for the prequel to Game of Thrones in the works. The first episode completed taping in Ireland and the dailies look \u201creally good\u201d, Bloys said. The planned series stars Naomi Watts and is set thousands of years before the original. Asked whether negative reaction to the Game of Thrones conclusion would shape the prequel, Bloys replied: \u201cNot at all.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The Mueller hearings dominated our day but were by no means the only news today. Here\u2019s our Wednesday summary: Democratic leaders in Congress, including Nancy Pelosi, said during a press conference that the Mueller hearings were just part of a case that she and her colleagues are building against Trump. During their own press conference following the Mueller hearings, Republican lawmakers urged their Democratic colleagues to put the Trump investigations behind them once and for all. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to build up America,\u201d said House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, \u201cand turn the page.\u201d Trump criticized the hearings, and the probe itself, saying \u201cRobert Mueller did a poor job, but in all fairness, he had nothing to work with.\u201d Several 2020 Democratic candidates reiterated their support for impeachment following Mueller\u2019s testimony. Facebook had a big day \u2014 reporting soaring revenues, even as it faces investigation. In Puerto Rico, lawmakers indicated that they would go forward with impeachment proceedings against disgraced governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, unless he resigned tonight. Rossell\u00f3 is expected to make an announcement later tonight but it\u2019s unclear whether he will step down, or double down. Watch for Guardian updates later today. A federal judge in California has ordered a preliminary injunction, blocking the Trump administration from enforcing new rules that end asylum protections for almost all migrants who arrive at the US-Mexico border The order reads: \u201cRule is likely invalid because the government\u2019s decision to promulgate it was arbitrary and capricious.\u201d Several Democratic presidential candidates have renewed their support for impeachment, The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino reports: Democratic 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren urged the House of Representatives to rise \u201cabove politics\u201d and launch impeachment proceedings against Donald Trump after the former special counsel Robert Mueller testified that his report on Russian election interference did not exonerate the president. Several leading Democratic presidential candidates renewed support for impeachment proceedings one day after the NAACP, America\u2019s oldest and largest civil rights organization, voted unanimously for the impeachment of Trump at their annual conference in Detroit, where several 2020 candidates spoke on Wednesday. It seems Donald Trump has vetoed bipartisan attempts to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. From Bloomberg: President Donald Trump vetoed three bipartisan measures passed by Congress intended to block arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, the White House said in a statement. \u201cThis resolution would weaken America\u2019s global competitiveness and damage the important relationships we share with our allies and partners,\u201d Trump said in a message to lawmakers released by the White House on Wednesday. Republican leaders in the House of Representatives gave their own press conference. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy said he could tell the Democratic leaders were disappointed with Mueller\u2019s testimony, because he \u201cwatched their body language,\u201d during their press conference. Jim Jordan, a Republican on the House oversight committee added that the president had been falsely accused. McCarthy said it was time for Democrats to put the investigations against Trump behind them. \u201cNow it\u2019s time to build up America,\u201d he said, \u201cand turn the page.\u201d House leader Nancy Pelosi, who has been criticized by fellow Democrats for dragging her feet on impeachment, said today\u2019s hearings are all part of a case that Democratic leaders are building \u2014 but that case still isn\u2019t strong enough. \u201cWhatever decision we make in that regard would have to be done with our strongest possible hand, and we still have some outstanding matters in the courts,\u201d she said. To continue building a case against Trump, Jerry Nadler indicated that Democrats will pursue Mueller\u2019s grand jury materials and to work to enforce a subpoena against former White House counsel Don McGahn. \u201cIf we have a case for impeachment, that\u2019s the place we will have to go,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe stronger our case is, the worse the Senate will look for letting the president off the hook.\u201d She added: \u201cThe facts and the law that\u2019s what matters, not politics, not partisanship.\u201d In opening statements, representative Elijah Cummings, who heads the oversight committee, said that investigating Trump is \u201cnot about not liking the president, it\u2019s about loving democracy, it\u2019s about loving our country.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m begging the American people to pay attention to what is going on,\u201d Cummings said, \u201cif you want to have a democracy intact.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a pretty interesting day,\u201d Nancy Pelosi says, speaking alongside judiciary and intelligence committee chairs Jerry Nadler and Adam Schiff, and oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings. Watch the press conference here. Another lawmaker has come out in support of impeaching Trump. Democratic congresswoman Lori Trahan of Massachusetts appears to be the first member of the House to hop on the impeachment bandwagon following Mueller\u2019s testimonies today. Per my count, we\u2019re now at 1 independent and 93 Democratic members of Congress now publicly supporting an impeachment. To pass articles of impeachment against Trump, at least 218 representatives would have to vote in favor. Trump challenger Bill Weld warns that refusing to condemn the president\u2019s racism would cost Republicans. From The Guardian\u2019s Lauren Gambino who is at the NAACP-hosted town hall in Detroit, Michigan: Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld, who is challenging Donald Trump for the Republican nomination, warned that his party\u2019s refusal to condemn the president\u2019s racism could inflict lasting damage. \u201cUnless the national Republican Party in Washington expressly, expressly rejects the racism of Donald Trump, it will become universally viewed as the party of racism in America,\u201d Weld said at a presidential town hall hosted by the NAACP in Detroit. How to respond to Trump was \u201cnot a political choice\u201d but \u201ca moral choice,\u201d Weld said. Weld is the only Republican challenging Trump for the nomination, a reality that underscores the president\u2019s enduring popularity with the party\u2019s base. Trump\u2019s most outspoken critics in Congress have virtually all resigned or lost re-election \u2013 a warning sign to any member who considers speaking out. After Trump\u2019s attacks on four congresswomen of color last week, most Republicans simply shrugged. A Reuters poll found that Trump\u2019s support among Republicans climbed in the days after he told lawmakers to \u201cgo back\u201d to the countries where they are from, a slur that is often directed at non-white Americans and immigrants. All four Democratic congresswomen \u2013 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar and Ayanna Pressley \u2013 are US citizens and only one, Omar, was not born in the US. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Donald Trump said, of the Mueller investigation: \u201cThis whole thing has been three years of embarrassment and waste of time for our country.\u201d He added that he thought the Democrats, in questioning Mueller, \u201churt themselves very badly for 2020.\u201d He accused the Democrats of \u201ccolluding\u201d with the media and repeated several times that his opponents are going to \u201close very badly\u201d in upcoming elections. The president also criticized the probe itself, saying \u201cRobert Mueller did a poor job, but in all fairness, he had nothing to work with.\u201d When a reporter asked him if he was worried about being indicted once he leaves office, he characterized the reporter as \u201cfake news.\u201d You can watch the press conference here. It\u2019s been a big day for Facebook. The company has reported soaring revenues, even as it faces investigation. From The Guardian\u2019s Julia Carrie Wong: Two giant fines by US government agencies totaling $5.1bn could not derail Facebook\u2019s financial juggernaut on Wednesday, as the company reported revenues of $16.9bn in the second quarter of 2019, exceeding analyst expectations. The social media company\u2019s regulatory concerns are by no means over, however. Facebook also disclosed on Wednesday that the FTC informed it in June that it has opened an antitrust investigation into the company. This follows the Department of Justice\u2019s announcement of a broad antitrust review of online platforms on Tuesday. The one-time costs of the two settlements depressed Facebook\u2019s profits for the second quarter in a row \u2013 the company recorded a $3bn expense last quarter in anticipation of a major fine \u2013 but revenue growth remained strong, at 28% year-over-year. What a Wednesday indeed! We\u2019ll have more updates on and analysis of the Mueller testimony throughout the rest of the day. Meanwhile, an update from Puerto Rico: The Puerto Rican legislature has announced that it will begin impeachment proceedings for disgraced governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 unless he resigns, according to journalists reporting from the US territory. Lawyers commissioned by the president of Puerto Rico\u2019s House of Representatives found multiple offenses that constitute grounds for impeachment, according to Telemundo. Local media reported earlier today that Rossell\u00f3 is expected to resign from office today after almost two weeks of continuous protest on the island. That\u2019s it from me after the longest Wednesday of the year. Although, in the Trump era, next Wednesday could easily claim that title. Here are some of the most important points Mueller made this afternoon: The special counsel emphasized that Russian election interference remains ongoing. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a single attempt. They\u2019re doing it as we sit here,\u201d Mueller said of Russia\u2019s efforts. \u201cAnd they expect to do it during the next campaign.\u201d He later expressed fear that foreign election interference was \u201cthe new normal.\u201d Mueller said in response to a question from Democratic representative Val Demings that it was \u201cgenerally\u201d fair to say Trump\u2019s written answers to the special counsel showed signs of being untruthful. He criticized Trump\u2019s praise of WikiLeaks during the 2016 campaign after the website shared hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cProblematic is an understatement,\u201d Mueller said of Trump\u2019s laudatory comments. Trump appeared triumphant after the hearings arguably produced no major bombshell moments. The president tweeted minutes ago, \u201cTRUTH IS A FORCE OF NATURE!\u201d But Mueller made a point to contradict Trump\u2019s repeated claims that his investigation constituted a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Answering a question from House intelligence committee chairman Adam Schiff, Mueller said, \u201cIt is not a witch hunt.\u201d And over at the White House, first lady Melania Trump is focused on a much more pressing matter today: holiday decorations. I\u2019m signing off until tomorrow. I leave the blog in the capable hands of West Coast reporter Maanvi Singh. Moments ago, Mueller said in response to a question from a Democratic congresswoman that it was \u201cgenerally\u201d fair to say that Trump\u2019s written answers were not always truthful. Representative Val Demings, a Democrat of Florida, was asking about Trump\u2019s credibility in terms of the written answers he provided to the special counsel. \u201cIsn\u2019t it fair to say [Trump\u2019s] written answers were not only inadequate and incomplete because he didn\u2019t answer many of your questions, but where he did, his answers show that he wasn\u2019t always being truthful?\u201d Demings asked. \u201cGenerally,\u201d Mueller replied. After nearly seven hours, the Mueller hearings have ended. Mueller said he chose not to subpoena Trump for the special counsel\u2019s probe \u201cbecause of the necessity of expediting the end of the investigation.\u201d While noting that his office initially wanted to interview Trump, the special counsel said, \u201cThe expectation was that, if we did subpoena the president, he would fight the subpoena, and we would be in the midst of the investigation for a substantial period of time.\u201d Representative Sean Maloney, a Democrat of New York, then asked Mueller what he thought of Trump\u2019s written responses to questions from the special counsel\u2019s office. \u201cIt was certainly not as useful as the interview would be,\u201d Mueller said. Maloney also said that the president\u2019s answers included more than 30 instances of Trump responding to questions by claiming he couldn\u2019t recall. Mueller emphasized in his testimony to the House intelligence committee that Russian election interference remains ongoing. Representative Will Hurd, a Republican of Texas, asked the special counsel if his investigation turned up any evidence that Russia would again try to interfere in US elections. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a single attempt. They\u2019re doing it as we sit here,\u201d Mueller responded. \u201cAnd they expect to do it during the next campaign.\u201d \u201cI hope this is not the new normal, but I fear it is,\u201d Mueller added later in response to a separate question about election interference from Peter Welch, a Democrat of Vermont. Trump\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow, said in a statement that Mueller\u2019s testimony revealed the \u201ctroubling deficiencies of the special counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d \u201cThe testimony revealed that this probe was conducted by a small group of politically biased prosecutors who, as hard as they tried, were unable to establish either obstruction, conspiracy, or collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia,\u201d the president\u2019s lawyer said. \u201cThe American people understand that this issue is over. They also understand that the case is closed.\u201d Mueller confirmed, in response to a question from Democratic representative Eric Swalwell, that the special counsel\u2019s investigation \u201cwas hampered by Trump campaign officials\u2019 use of encryption communications.\u201d \u201cWe believe that to be the case,\u201d Mueller replied to Swalwell. This is from Mueller\u2019s report on some Trump campaign officials\u2019 use of encrypted communication apps: Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated-including some associated with the Trump Campaign \u2014 deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts. CNN is reporting that Trump\u2019s mood has noticeably improved after Mueller\u2019s appearance before the House judiciary committee. Reporter Kaitlan Collins said the president\u2019s reaction to the special counsel\u2019s testimony has been \u201ctriumphant.\u201d Trump has also kept up his Twitter activity, resharing messages from congressional allies criticizing Mueller and his team. And the communications director of Trump\u2019s re-election campaign said Democrats were getting \u201crouted\u201d in the hearings. Mueller took serious issue with a claim from representative Chris Stewart, a Republican of Utah, that the special counsel\u2019s office was leaking during its investigation. The special counsel\u2019s office was infamous in Washington for being leak-proof, but Stewart pointed to news reports about the investigation to argue that members of Mueller\u2019s team were sharing information with reporters. \u201cI do not believe that,\u201d Mueller told Stewart. \u201cFrom the outset, we\u2019d undertaken to make certain that we minimized the possibility of leaks. I think we were successful over the two years we were in operation.\u201d Mueller described Trump\u2019s 2016 praise of WikiLeaks as, at the very least, problematic. Representative Mike Quigley, a Democrat of Illinois, documented the many instances of Trump applauding the website after it leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. Quigley then turned to Mueller, who said of Trump\u2019s repeated praise, \u201cProblematic is an understatement ... in terms of giving some hope or some boost to what is and should be illegal activity.\u201d Mueller told representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat of California, that he hopes his report serves as a \u201cmessage to those who come after us\u201d. Asked what he wanted the American people to glean from his report, Mueller called it \u201ca signal, a flag, to those of us who have some responsibility in this area, to exercise those responsibilities swiftly and don\u2019t let this problem continue to linger.\u201d Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican of North Carolina and a close ally of Trump, was seen at the White House a few minutes ago, per a CNN reporter. Meadows sat in on Mueller\u2019s hearing before the House judiciary committee this morning and has been tweeting about his testimony all day, accusing the special counsel of having no control over his team. Our colleague Sabrina Siddiqui analyzes several of the key takeaways from Mueller\u2019s morning testimony: Trump was not exonerated. Mueller and his team were never going to indict Trump. Trump could be charged with a crime after leaving office. Republicans focused on discrediting Mueller. Mueller says he did not seek FBI director job. Mueller confirms several episodes of possible obstruction. Representative Mike Turner, a Republican of Ohio, brought out a sign with a CNN chyron to grill Mueller on his comments about exoneration. The special counsel said during his testimony before the House judiciary committee that his report did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice. Republicans are now arguing that it was not Mueller\u2019s call whether or not to exonerate the president. Mueller also confirmed that Trump\u2019s claims of Russian interference being a hoax were false. \u201cWhen the president said the Russian interference was a hoax, that was false wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the intelligence committee, asked. Mueller replied, \u201cTrue.\u201d Mueller confirmed that Russians meant to aid Trump with their election interference, which included the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee. \u201cWhich presidential candidate was Russia\u2019s hacking-and-dumping scheme intended to benefit?\u201d asked representative Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut. Mueller replied, \u201cMr. Trump.\u201d Under questioning from the chairman of the intelligence committee, Mueller contradicted Trump\u2019s repeated claims that his investigation was a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d \u201cIt is not a witch hunt,\u201d the special counsel told Adam Schiff. Mueller opened his appearance before the House intelligence committee by correcting his earlier comments to Democratic representative Ted Lieu. While testfiying before the House judiciary committee this morning, Mueller seemed to imply that he would have charged Trump if he were not a sitting president. A longstanding policy from the Office of Legal Counsel warns against indicting sitting presidents. Lieu asked Mueller this morning, \u201cThe reason you did not indict Donald Trump... is because of the OLC decision. Is that correct?\u201d Mueller replied, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d But Mueller corrected himself before the intelligence committee. He said that the OLC policy in fact prevented him from making a determination on whether Trump should be charged. That correction is sure to disappoint pro-impeachment Democrats, given that the moment was widely shared on social media and considered by many to be a boost to their cause. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, used his opening statement to accuse Trump\u2019s campaign of \u201cdisloyalty to country.\u201d \u201cThose are strong words, but how else are we to describe a presidential campaign which did not inform the authorities of a foreign offer of dirt on their opponent, which did not publicly shun it, or turn it away, but which instead invited it, encouraged it, and made full use of it?\u201d Schiff said. Schiff concluded by saying, \u201cThis is what is at stake. Our next election, and the one after that, for generations to come. Our democracy. This is why your work matters, Mr. Mueller. This is why our investigation matters. To bring these dangers to light.\u201d Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the panel, expressed hope in his opening statement that the hearing would bring about a permanent end to probes into the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. He dismissed Mueller\u2019s appearance as the \u201clast gasp of the Russian collusion conspiracy theory.\u201d Trump has weighed in over Twitter once again on Mueller\u2019s congressional testimony, thanking Democrats for inviting the special counsel to Capitol Hill. Echoing the statement from his press secretary, Trump dismissed the hearings as \u201can embarrassment.\u201d The White House dismissed Mueller\u2019s morning testimony before the House judiciary committee as an \u201cepic embarrassment.\u201d \u201cThe last three hours have been an epic embarrassment for the Democrats,\u201d press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. \u201cExpect more of the same in the second half.\u201d Trump appears to be glued to the hearings, retweeting conservative commentary reiterating the president\u2019s dubious claims of \u201cno obstruction\u201d and \u201cno collusion.\u201d Bernard Madoff, who fleeced investors of billions of dollars in the largest Ponzi scheme in history, has filed a petition with the US justice department asking Donald Trump to reduce Madoff\u2019s sentence. Madoff, who pleaded guilty to running a $64.8bn Ponzi scheme in 2009, is not asking for a pardon from the president, but for a commutation of his 150-year prison sentence. The Department of Justice website shows Madoff requested his sentence be commuted and lists the status of the request as \u201cpending.\u201d It is not known whether Trump will consider the request. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House intelligence committee, has gaveled in the second hearing of Mueller\u2019s appearance. The intelligence committee\u2019s hearing with Mueller should soon get underway, and the panel\u2019s questioning will ostensibly take a different focus than the judiciary committee\u2019s. Members of the intelligence committee are expected to question the special counsel about the first volume of his report, which described Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mueller\u2019s team found that Trump\u2019s team was repeatedly in contact with Russian entities, but the special counsel crucially concluded that there was not enough evidence to bring conspiracy charges. The Republicans on the panel will almost certainly try to find as many ways as possible to have Mueller reiterate that his office chose not to bring charges. Democrats will likely focus on the contacts Mueller\u2019s team uncovered between Russian intermediaries and Trump\u2019s campaign. Stay tuned. Puerto Rico\u2019s embattled governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 is expected to resign from office today after almost two weeks of continuous protest in the US territory, according to local media. Rossell\u00f3 has been at the centre of a leaked text message scandal, which has led to mass demonstration across the island. He has gradually lost the support of key figures in his ruling New Progressive Party and announced on Sunday he would not run for re-election in 2020. The Guardian has not independently confirmed the reporting. Earlier in the month hundreds of pages of leaked messages, published by the Centre of Investigative Journalism, revealed a slew of homophobic and misogynist remarks shared between the governor and 11 members of his inner circle. The messages also included a joke about dead bodies during hurricane Maria, which devastated the island in September 2017. The messages drew bipartisan outrage on the island and have led to hundreds of thousands marching on the streets. On Monday, a general strike on the island led to the shutdown of a major highway in San Juan. The governor has attempted to cling to power throughout the demonstrations, which have often been dispersed by police with tear gas and rubber bullets, but his position has looked increasingly untenable in recent days. The Rossell\u00f3 administration has been plagued by corruption and allegations of mismanagement during the response to hurricane Maria. Although the Trump administration has stopped short of calling for Rossell\u00f3\u2019s resignation, the president has frequently criticised the governor and lied about the federal government\u2019s checkered record in assisting after the hurricane. Puerto Rico\u2019s economic affairs are overseen by an unelected fiscal control board, appointed in Washington, that has contributed to sweeping austerity and privatization on the island. As we await the start of the intelligence committee hearing, here are some of the biggest points that Mueller made in his appearance before the judiciary committee. He stuck to his commitment in his opening statement to adhere to the report and not discuss internal Justice Department matters. But he did confirm that his report did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice. Mueller acknowledged that Trump could be charged after he leaves office. The special counsel repeatedly cited a longstanding Justice Department policy not to indict sitting presidents. In this exchange with Democratic representative Ted Lieu, Mueller seemed to indicate that Trump would have been indicted if not for that Justice Department policy. It\u2019s clear that all of Washington has its eyes on Mueller today. A New York Times photographer captured this picture from inside the judiciary committee hearing: The judiciary committee has ended its hearing with Mueller, a mere half hour after expected. The intelligence committee hearing was supposed to begin at noon, but that would have allowed Mueller a 20-minute break between hearings if the judiciary committee hearing had ended on time. Stay tuned on when the intelligence committee starts its hearing. Multiple Democratic presidential contenders are sticking by their previous recommendations for the House to start impeachment proceedings, echoing fellow fellow candidate Cory Booker. The judiciary committee hearing with Mueller is still going, even though the intelligence committee\u2019s hearing was set to begin at noon. Judiciary committee chairman Jerry Nadler had asked the remaining Democrats on the panel to keep their questioning short, but that has predictably not panned out. The hearing is now at least 20 minutes over time. \u201cExcuse me, it\u2019s my time,\u201d Representative Mike Johnson, a Republican from Louisiana, told Mueller as the special counsel tried to make a point about Johnson\u2019s \u201csummary\u201d of his testimony. The judiciary committee hearing has already run long, and the intelligence committee hearing is supposed to begin in less than 10 minutes. Republicans now seem to have no concern about railroading Mueller in order to present his report in the most favorable light for Trump. The final data on how much Mueller spoke during Republicans\u2019 \u201cquestioning\u201d should be interesting. Mueller has taken on a harsher tone as he defends the integrity of the team that he compiled for the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Representative Kelly Armstrong, a Republican from North Dakota, has been taking up Trump\u2019s mantle of accusing Mueller\u2019s team of being a bunch of biased Democrats. But Mueller is ardently standing by his employees, saying that he hired the best people for the job and that it has never been his practice to ask staffers about their political leanings. Mueller\u2019s confirmation that Trump could still be charged with obstruction of justice once he leaves the White House has rightfully raised eyebrows, and not least because of who prompted the remark: Republican representative Ken Buck. Here\u2019s what Twitter has had to say: Mueller said he did not believe he was applying for the FBI director job when he spoke to Trump about the position just before he was appointed as special counsel. Trump has repeatedly claimed that Mueller wanted the job of FBI director, which the special counsel held for 12 years and left in 2013. The president and his Republican allies have repeatedly insinuated that Mueller was biased against Trump because he wanted to become FBI director again and was turned down. But Mueller just told Representative Greg Steube, a Republican from Florida, that he did not believe he was applying for the job when he spoke to Trump. He thought he was simply offering the president input on who to choose for the position after firing Jim Comey. Judiciary hearing likely to stretch long Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, just asked the remaining members of the panel to shorten their questioning due to time constraints. The hearing was supposed to last three hours, which would mean it would end at 11:40 a.m. given the panel\u2019s 10-minute break. But the likelihood of lawmakers shortening their questioning of Mueller seems ... slim. Here is Washington bureau chief David Smith\u2019s report from inside the room at Mueller\u2019s hearing: No wonder Robert Mueller was a reluctant witness. Washington\u2019s partisan divide is again on full display in the packed committee room 2141 in the Rayburn building on Capitol Hill at a hearing unlikely to change many minds. Democrats are carefully guiding the former special counsel through Donald Trump\u2019s various attempts to obstruct justice, including his effort to fire Mueller himself. Members are reading chunks of the report to him because he apparently declined to read it aloud: The downside of this is that the words come out of politicians\u2019 mouths rather than carrying the neutral authority of Mueller\u2019s own voice. He generally offers little more than \u201cYes\u201d, \u201cTrue\u201d, \u201cCorrect\u201d or \u201cI refer you to the report\u201d. The central Democratic case appears to be: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d Republicans, for their part, have been grandstanding, often delivering speeches rather than asking questions, trying to chip away at Mueller\u2019s credibility. They have suggested he overstepped by saying he could not exonerate Trump because he deserves the presumption of innocence as much as anyone else. There are about 70 people, many of them young, squeezed into public seating behind Mueller and his aides, watched over by police officers. Reporters are typing on laptops to one side. Whoever is speaking is shown on big TV screens on the walls. The only person who doesn\u2019t want to be here is Mueller himself. Several times he has asked for questions to be repeated and he seems less familiar with his report than many of the members. Famously slow and methodical, these pinballing questions are not his forte. He is a star witness without star power. Preet Bharara, a former US prosecutor who was fired by Trump, argued that Mueller nearly acknowledged that the president would have been indicted if he were not in office. Citing an exchange between the special counsel and Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat from California, Bharara said that Mueller was indicating that the only reason he didn\u2019t charge Trump was because of a policy outlined by the Office of the Legal Counsel. That OLC policy warns against indicting a sitting president. It reads: \u201cThe indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\u201d Mueller replied to a question from Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, that Trump could be charged after he leaves office. Mueller has repeatedly said he did not feel he could charge Trump because of longstanding Justice Department policy warning against indicting a sitting president. But that policy would no longer apply after Trump leaves office. Trump has once again weighed in on Mueller\u2019s hearing to repeat his claim of \u201cno obstruction.\u201d But Mueller has over and over again in his testimony emphasized that he did not consider it his team\u2019s responsibility to determine whether Trump obstructed justice. Instead, Mueller laid out several instances in his report that may constitute obstruction of justice and left the decision up to Congress. He has also repeatedly emphasized that, in accordance with Justice Department policy, he did not believe he had the ability to indict a sitting president. Under questioning from Representative Ken Buck, a Republican from Colorado, Mueller cited his inability to indict a sitting president. \u201cOne of the tools that a prosecutor would use is not there,\u201d Mueller said of his team\u2019s considerations of Trump\u2019s potential obstruction of justice. Mueller was citing a long-standing Justice Department policy outlined by the Office of Legal Counsel. The official policy reads: \u201cThe indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would unconstitutionally undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\u201d But, but, but: the special counsel noted that Trump could be charged after he left office. Mueller has declined or deflected questions asked by House members 60 times already, according to a count by NBC News. And CBS News noted that Mueller has provided one-word responses at least 41 times. Mueller confirmed in response to a question from Representative Cedric Richmond, a Democrat from Louisiana, that Trump asked staff to falsify records connected to the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Booker: report is enough to start impeachment proceedings Our colleague Lauren Gambino reports from the NAACP convention in Detroit that presidential candidate Cory Booker said Mueller\u2019s report \u201cis enough of an indication that the House of representatives should begin impeachment proceedings against the president.\u201d You can expect to hear that line a lot from pro-impeachment Democrats if Mueller\u2019s hearing doesn\u2019t produce any bombshell moments. So far, Mueller\u2019s testimony hasn\u2019t advanced impeachment cause There seems to be a general consensus building that Mueller has so far not helped the cause of pro-impeachment Democrats. The special counsel\u2019s answers have been slow and deliberate, and he has stuck to his commitment to avoid going beyond the details of his report. There have seemingly been no bombshell moments for pro-impeachment Democrats to point to in their argument to start an inquiry. A longtime Washington Post congressional reporter put it bluntly: Unsurprisingly, the president is watching the special counsel\u2019s hearing. He just tweeted a \u201cquote\u201d from Fox News anchor Chris Wallace. But Trump\u2019s Twitter quotes should be taken with a grain of salt, given his penchant for being less than exact in his accuracy. Representative Jim Jordan, a close congressional ally of Trump, is pushing Mueller on the origins of the investigation, even though he specifically said he would not touch on that. The mild-mannered Mueller adopted perhaps his harshest tone so far. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I agree with your characterizations,\u201d Mueller told the Ohio Republican as he lambasted the investigation. Jordan specifically dug into the role that Maltese professor Joseph Mifsud played in sparking the special counsel\u2019s investigation. The Washington Post has more on Mifsud: The Maltese-born academic has not surfaced publicly since [October 2017], days after Trump campaign aide George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about details of their interactions. Among them, Papadopoulos told investigators, was an April 2016 meeting in which Mifsud alerted him that the Russians had \u2018dirt\u2019 on Hillary Clinton in the form of \u2018thousands of emails.\u2019 The conversation between Mifsud and Papadopoulos, eventually relayed by an Australian diplomat to U.S. government officials, was cited by [Mueller] as the event that set in motion the FBI probe into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. With [Barr\u2019s] review of the counterintelligence investigation underway, the origins of the inquiry itself are now in the spotlight \u2014 and with them, the role of Mifsud, a little-known figure. In Mifsud\u2019s absence, a number of President Trump\u2019s allies and advisers have been floating a provocative theory: that the Maltese professor was a Western intelligence plant. Mueller\u2019s new tagline: \u2018I can\u2019t get into that\u2019 Sticking to his opening statement, Mueller is strenuously avoiding discussing internal Justice Department deliberations. Representative Martha Roby, a Republican from Alabama, repeatedly tried to press Mueller on his discussions with Attorney General William Barr after the completion of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. Democrats have criticized Barr for his characterization of Mueller\u2019s report before the redacted version of it was publicly released. They claimed the attorney general had purposely tried to craft a public impression more favorable to Trump than the details of the report actually allowed. Mueller sent a letter to Barr raising concerns about his summary of the report, a letter that was later leaked to the press. Roby asked Mueller about how the letter found its way into the press, but he declined to discuss that or anything else about his discussions with Barr after the investigation concluded. \u201cI can\u2019t get into that,\u201d Mueller repeatedly told Roby. Well, that was predictable. Representative Louie Gohmert, a Republican from Texas, grilled Mueller on the anti-Trump views of former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page. While Strzok was working on the special counsel\u2019s investigation, he exchanged text messages criticizing Trump with Page, with whom he was having an extramarital affair. Republicans have repeatedly pointed toward Strzok\u2019s anti-Trump views to argue that the probe was biased from the beginning. But Mueller told the committee that he did not know Strzok hated Trump when he was hired and that the special counsel \u201cacted swiftly\u201d to remove him from the investigation once the messages were discovered. Gohmert took less than kindly to Mueller\u2019s responses, as a CNN reporter noted. Mueller told the House judiciary committee that he had no conflicts of interest preventing him from serving as special counsel. Trump has repeatedly claimed, most recently this morning, that Mueller was \u201chighly conflicted,\u201d in part because he applied to retake his post as FBI director. But there\u2019s no evidence that Mueller wanted to become the director of the FBI again after serving in the post for 12 years. Trump has also claimed other members of the special counsel\u2019s teams were \u201cAngry Democrats,\u201d but Mueller used his opening statement to emphasize that all of his staffers were of the \u201chighest integrity.\u201d So far, most Democrats on the House judiciary committee have used their time to confirm some of the most damning portions of Mueller\u2019s report. For example, Democratic Representative Hank Johnson is walking through Trump directing former White House counsel Don McGahn to fire the special counsel. But Republicans like John Ratcliffe have largely used their time to question the scope of Mueller\u2019s investigation and whether his probe followed Justice Department regulations. Mueller declined to say whether anything in the second volume of his report, which focuses on Trump\u2019s potential obstruction of justice, is impeachable conduct. \u201cOur mandate does not go to other ways of addressing conduct,\u201d Mueller said in response to a question from Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democratic congresswoman from Texas, asked Mueller whether obstruction of justice would warrant substantial jail time. \u201cYes,\u201d Mueller replied. John Ratcliffe, a Republican on the House judiciary committee, is using his five minutes of questions to ... not ask many questions. Ratcliffe is emphasizing the presumption of innocence in the US justice system, arguing that that presumption extends to sitting presidents. And he is accusing the special counsel of violating every principle set forth for prosecutors. His rant left little to no opportunity for Mueller to respond. Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, asked Mueller to confirm that his report did not exonerate the president, despite Trump\u2019s repeated claims of \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201cno obstruction\u201d. \u201cDid you actually totally exonerate the president?\u201d Nadler asked. \u201cNo,\u201d Mueller replied. Mueller said, \u201cIt is correct that my report does not exonerate President Trump for obstruction of justice.\u201d Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, is hammering Mueller on the distinction between the terms collusion and conspiracy. \u201cI\u2019m reading your report, sir,\u201d Collins said sternly as he noted the use of the term collusion in Mueller\u2019s report, which the congressman said was equated to conspiracy. The distinction may seem trivial, but it matters a great deal to Trump, who has started a mantra of \u201cno collusion\u201d to dismiss Mueller\u2019s investigation. But the special counsel said in his opening statement that his report did not touch on collusion because it was \u201cnot a legal term.\u201d Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, used his five minutes of questions to emphasize the president\u2019s refusal to be interviewed. Mueller confirmed that his office went back and forth with Trump\u2019s team for months over an interview that never took place. The special counsel used his opening statement to outline what his report did not cover \u2060\u2013 and by extension, what his testimony would not include. \u201cWe did not address \u2018collusion,\u2019 which is not a legal term,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cRather, we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy. It was not.\u201d He also said he would respect the Department of Justice\u2019s requests limiting his testimony. \u201c[T]he Justice Department has asserted privileges concerning investigative information and decisions, ongoing matters within the Justice Department, and deliberations within our office,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cThese are Justice Department privileges that I will respect.\u201d He added, \u201cI therefore will not be able to answer questions about certain areas that I know are of public interest. For example, I am unable to address questions about the opening of the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation, which occurred months before my appointment, or matters related to the so-called \u2018Steele Dossier.\u201d Mueller has been sworn in and has made his opening statement, which he has used in part to note that his report does not touch on the matter of \u201ccollusion\u201d because that is not a legal term. Mueller notes that his appearance is \u201cunusual\u201d given his role as a prosecutor in this criminal case. And he emphasized that his testimony may be \u201climited\u201d given that some details may affect \u201congoing matters.\u201d He also noted he would not be able to address the opening of the investigation or the Steele dossier, surely disappointing Republicans who appeared to be trying to discredit the probe by arguing it was launched due to anti-Trump bias. He then introduced his deputy, Aaron Zebley, who will be helping him answer questions. But reporting indicates that Zebley will not be answering any questions himself. And Mueller took pains to emphasize that members of the special counsel\u2019s office were of the \u201chighest integrity,\u201d despite the president\u2019s attacks upon them. Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the House judiciary committee, used his opening statement to emphasize Trump\u2019s claims of \u201cno collusion.\u201d \u201cIn fact, the report concludes no one in the president\u2019s campaign colluded, collaborated or conspired with Russians,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe president watched the public narrative surrounding the investigation assume his guilt while he knew the extent of his innocence.\u201d Well, in fact, Mueller concluded that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of collusion to bring conspiracy charges, which is certainly different from the \u201cno collusion\u201d claims of the president. Collins also said he looked forward to hearing about Mueller\u2019s \u201creview of the origins of this investigation,\u201d indicating Republicans may try to argue that the probe was launched in bad faith. Jerry Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House judiciary committee, has kicked off his panel\u2019s hearing with Mueller by applauding the special counsel\u2019s work and exemplary record of service. \u201cFor 22 months, you never commented in public about your work\u2014even when you were subjected to repeated and grossly unfair personal attacks. Instead, your indictments spoke for you, and in astonishing detail,\u201d the New York congressman said. \u201cAlthough Department policy barred you from indicting the President for this conduct, you made clear that he is not exonerated. Any other person who acted this way would have been charged with a crime. And in this nation, not even the President is above the law.\u201d We\u2019re minutes away from the first hearing of Mueller\u2019s appearance on Capitol Hill. The Guardian is streaming it live here. The first hearing, before the House judiciary committee, is expected to focus on the second volume of Mueller\u2019s report, which focuses on potential obstruction of justice. Democrats are expected to push Mueller on whether he believes Trump would have been charged with obstruction of justice if he we not a sitting president. And Republicans are likely to emphasize that Mueller chose not to charge Trump with obstruction, even though the special counsel emphasized that he was not clearing him of that charge. House Democrats are urging Mueller to ignore attempts by the Department of Justice and Attorney General William Barr to constrict what the special counsel tells the House committees this morning. My colleague Jon Swaine reports: Mueller was warned in a letter from the justice department late on Monday that his testimony on Capitol Hill \u2018must remain within the boundaries\u2019 of his investigation report, which was released to the public in April. But Jerrold Nadler, the chairman of the House judiciary committee, said on Tuesday that Donald Trump and [Barr] had \u2018repeatedly lied\u2019 about Mueller\u2019s findings and that Mueller should feel free to set the record straight. \u2018He does not have to comply with that letter. He doesn\u2019t work for them. And that letter asks things that are beyond the power of the agency to ask even if he still worked for them,\u2019 Nadler told CNN. But even if Mueller does strictly stick to the letter of his report, the hearing could still be \u201cdamning and explosive,\u201d as Representative David Cicilline told Sabrina Siddiqui. That sentiment reflects many Democrats\u2019 belief that the details of the report reflect so negatively upon Trump that they should be enough to begin impeachment proceedings, which dozens of House Democrats already back. Trump is still tweeting incessantly about Mueller\u2019s investigation, despite previously saying that he didn\u2019t plan to watch the special counsel\u2019s testimony. And the president\u2019s first question: why didn\u2019t you investigate Hillary Clinton about her email server? (Of course, Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state was investigated and ended in 2016 without criminal charges.) Trump also repeated his claim that Mueller asked him to become FBI director director, but there\u2019s no evidence Mueller, who served as FBI director for 12 years, wanted the job again. But Trump\u2019s claims give some indication of how Republicans may handle Mueller\u2019s testimony this morning. In addition to highlighting that the special counsel concluded there wasn\u2019t enough evidence of collusion to bring conspiracy charges, House Republicans will likely try to deflect from the section of Mueller\u2019s report dealing with potential obstruction of justice. In his report, Mueller detailed 11 instances of potential obstruction of justice. The special counsel chose not to charge Trump with obstruction, at least partly because there is great legal debate around indicting a sitting president. He appeared to leave the decision of what to do with the obstruction evidence up to Congress \u2060\u2014 which brings us to today. The special counsel has arrived on Capitol Hill, where he will testify first to the House Judiciary Committee in Room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building. People have been camped out at the House overnight to get a seat for the hearing. A CNN reporter wrote on Twitter that the line to get in to the small room was led by congressional intern Maddie Moore, who specifically asked Capitol Hill security in advance whether she could stay overnight. Good morning, live blog readers \u2060\u2013 and happy Mueller day! Special counsel Robert Mueller will be testifying before Congress beginning at 8.30am Washington time. He will speak first to the House judiciary committee and then to the House intelligence committee starting at noon. The Guardian will be streaming the testimony, and I\u2019ll put that link in the blog when it\u2019s live. Here is some of the last-minute drama surrounding the already dramatic proceedings: Mueller\u2019s last-minute decision to have his deputy, Aaron Zebley, appear alongside him has angered many Republicans \u2013 including Donald Trump. Our commander-in-chief was up early this morning complaining that Zebley\u2019s appearance was \u201cspecifically NOT agreed to\u201d and that Mueller should have focused on investigating \u201cCrooked Hillary Clinton\u201d or \u201cLyin\u2019 &amp; Leakin\u2019 James Comey\u201d. But Mueller reportedly only wants Zebley to appear with him to help him with some of the details from the Russia investigation, which seems pretty reasonable given that the inquiry stretched on for two years and resulted in a 448-page report. Mueller will give a short opening statement, which was rather unusually not leaked to the press in advance. The special counsel ran a famously leak-proof investigation, which seems to be carrying over to his testimony. Mueller has said his testimony will stick to the facts of his report. But Democrats think he could shift public opinion simply by reiterating the known facts of his investigation, given that only 3 percent of Americans have read the full report. We\u2019ll cover more of what to expect from Mueller\u2019s testimony here in the blog before the special counsel is sworn in. Stay tuned.",
