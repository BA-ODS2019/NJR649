      "bodyText": "Allegations of unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment at work are being routinely covered up by employers through secret non-disclosure agreements (NDAs), a report by MPs has warned. The increasingly widespread practice enables perpetrators to carry on mistreating others and prevents victims from discovering or supporting other complaints, according to the Commons\u2019 women and equalities committee. The MPs\u2019 strongly worded report said difficulties in pursuing claims through employment tribunals \u2013 where legal aid financial thresholds have rendered legal advice largely unaffordable \u2013 meant staff often felt they had little choice but to reach a confidential settlement prohibiting them from speaking out. The use of NDAs to prevent those who have signed them from providing evidence to police inquiries or court proceedings was specifically condemned. \u201cThere is clearly potential for NDAs to be negotiated, drafted, and/or enforced in ways which may amount to perverting the course of justice,\u201d the report said. NDAs are legally drafted contracts under which employers usually agree to pay departing employees rather than resist a claim at a tribunal, meaning allegations of unlawful discrimination are subject to \u201croutine cover-up\u201d and not properly investigated, MPs said. Maria Miller, the Conservative former culture secretary who chairs the committee, said: \u201cIt is particularly worrying that secrecy about allegations of unlawful discrimination is being traded for things that employers should be providing as a matter of course, such as references and remedial action to tackle discrimination. \u201cAfter signing an NDA, many individuals find it difficult to work in the same sector again.

There is also the financial penalty of losing a job and bringing a case against an employer. \u201cOrganisations have a duty of care to provide a safe place of work for their staff and that includes protection from unlawful discrimination.\u201d The committee has urged the government to ensure NDAs cannot prevent legitimate discussion of allegations of unlawful discrimination or harassment and wants it to stop their use in covering up allegations of unlawful discrimination. Some witnesses told the committee NDAs allowed employees to move on with their life and career quickly and quietly, without the stress of going to tribunal. Others suggested confidential agreements delivered higher payments than might be awarded at a tribunal. Joeli Brearley, the founder of the organisation Pregnant Then Screwed, which supports mothers facing workplace discrimination, told MPs there was no incentive for employers to settle without confidentiality. Another problem the report highlighted was that online publication of tribunal judgments had increased the risk for claimants of being blacklisted by future employers. It suggested this was a significant barrier to potential claimants bringing discrimination claims. \u201cWe are particularly troubled by the suggestion that ethnic minorities may be disproportionately disadvantaged by the online reporting of tribunal judgments,\u201d the report added. On legal advice, it said: \u201cWe are concerned by the lack of affordable legal advice available for employment discrimination cases \u2026 The government should review legal aid thresholds and monitor the effect of the changes it is making to improve access to legal aid.\u201d MPs were \u201cdisappointed, but not surprised, to hear examples of large employers using [their] significant resources to put considerable pressure on employees who pursue allegations of discrimination or harassment at tribunal \u2013 for example by making the process more protracted and difficult \u2013 instead of taking action to tackle and prevent future discrimination or harassment.\u201d The committee called on the government to begin a programme to raise awareness among employers and employees about how to handle grievances fairly and effectively, including signposting to relevant guidance and support. It also suggested ministers should consider requiring employers to investigate all discrimination and harassment complaints regardless of whether a settlement is reached. The report also called on the government to legislate to require employers to provide, as a minimum, a basic reference for any former employee confirming they worked for that employer and the dates of their employment.",

      "bodyText": "Spending on speech and language therapy has fallen in many areas of the country and children in need of SLT are subject to a postcode lottery of provision because of huge disparities across England, research has found. The study by the children\u2019s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, says that too many vulnerable young children are missing out on vital support in their earliest years, with far-reaching implications for their progress and life chances. It is the first time data has been brought together from councils and clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), who jointly commission SLT services, to show how much different regions spend. Taking into account population growth and inflation, the report finds that real-terms spending on speech and language services has decreased in three out of five areas of the country. While the top 25% of spending areas in England invest more than \u00a316 per child, the lowest 25% spend just 58p or less.

Many of their clients are young people who are particularly vulnerable because they are or have been in care, in a gang, or under the supervision of a pupil referral unit.</p> <p>The research also found that:</p> <ul> <li><p>A third of five-to-10-year-olds have been the victims of cyberbullying.</p></li> <li><p>Children of that age are being exposed to unsuitable or harmful material online.</p></li> <li><p>79% of support workers have dealt with 11-to-15-year-olds who have suffered cyberbullying.</p></li> <li><p>58% of those helping those 16 or over had seen cases of self-harm and attempted suicide linked to the young person\u2019s history of cyberbullying.</p></li> <li><p>78% of support workers had come across young people of that age who had been groomed online.</p></li> </ul> <p>\u201cAlthough the internet offers incredible opportunities to learn and play, it also carries serious new risks from cyberbullying to online grooming,\u201d said Javed Khan, Barnardo\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThese risks can have a devastating impact on the lives of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d</p> <p>However, the charity added that social media can also offer benefits, such as reducing vulnerable young people\u2019s isolation and loneliness, and letting them link up with people like them.</p> <p>\u201cThese findings shine more light on the potentially harmful relationship between social media and youngsters\u2019 mental health and wellbeing, with this report suggesting it could be a problem for some children, from a very young age,\u201d said Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national mental health director.</p> <p>Social media platforms need to start paying a levy to help fund NHS treatment of the growing number of children and young people whose mental health is harmed by using them, Murdoch added.</p> <p>Barnardo\u2019s highlighted the case of an 11-year-old girl who tried to end her life after suffering cyberbullying by young people who found out that her father had been sent to prison and was on the sex offender register.</p> <p>\u201cI got horrible messages from children saying: \u2018Your dad\u2019s a pervert, you might as well kill yourself now.\u2019 Due to the comments, I began to hate myself and felt \u2018outside\u2019 of everything, so then I tried to kill myself,\u201d the girl told the charity.</p> <p>Tom Madders, campaigns director at the charity Young Minds, said: \u201cUsing phones and being online from a young age, including having access to social media accounts, has become a normal part of life for many children. The children and young people we work with tell us about the positives of using technology, but also that being exposed to harmful content or being bullied round the clock on social media can have a serious impact on their mental health.\u201d</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/04/social-media-bosses-could-be-liable-for-harmful-content-leaked-uk-plan-reveals\">a white paper in April </a>on combating online harm, the government pledged to take action to tackle the problem. That included putting a new legal duty of care on providers to ensure that young users do not come to harm from accessing their content.</p>",

Barnardo\u2019s is concerned that early access to electronic devices could lead to both addiction and a loss of key social skills as families spend less time talking among themselves. It warns in a report into the effects of technology and social media on children that platforms such as Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter are having a \u201cdisturbing\u201d impact on the mental health of under-18s. The report said: \u201cBarnardo\u2019s practitioners raised concerns in relation to the social and emotional development of very young children when they interact with social media. \u201cWorries regarding addiction and the substitution of time spent with family for the use of social media were issues that were felt to cause problems related to mental health and emotional wellbeing in this age group. \u201cKey apprehensions included the failure to think creatively, interact with others socially and manage their own emotions.\u201d The report\u2019s findings were based on testimony from 80 support workers who work with under-18s at 30 Barnardo\u2019s projects across the UK. Many of their clients are young people who are particularly vulnerable because they are or have been in care, in a gang, or under the supervision of a pupil referral unit. The research also found that: A third of five-to-10-year-olds have been the victims of cyberbullying. Children of that age are being exposed to unsuitable or harmful material online. 79% of support workers have dealt with 11-to-15-year-olds who have suffered cyberbullying. 58% of those helping those 16 or over had seen cases of self-harm and attempted suicide linked to the young person\u2019s history of cyberbullying. 78% of support workers had come across young people of that age who had been groomed online. \u201cAlthough the internet offers incredible opportunities to learn and play, it also carries serious new risks from cyberbullying to online grooming,\u201d said Javed Khan, Barnardo\u2019s chief executive. \u201cThese risks can have a devastating impact on the lives of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable children.\u201d However, the charity added that social media can also offer benefits, such as reducing vulnerable young people\u2019s isolation and loneliness, and letting them link up with people like them. \u201cThese findings shine more light on the potentially harmful relationship between social media and youngsters\u2019 mental health and wellbeing, with this report suggesting it could be a problem for some children, from a very young age,\u201d said Claire Murdoch, NHS England\u2019s national mental health director. Social media platforms need to start paying a levy to help fund NHS treatment of the growing number of children and young people whose mental health is harmed by using them, Murdoch added. Barnardo\u2019s highlighted the case of an 11-year-old girl who tried to end her life after suffering cyberbullying by young people who found out that her father had been sent to prison and was on the sex offender register. \u201cI got horrible messages from children saying: \u2018Your dad\u2019s a pervert, you might as well kill yourself now.\u2019 Due to the comments, I began to hate myself and felt \u2018outside\u2019 of everything, so then I tried to kill myself,\u201d the girl told the charity. Tom Madders, campaigns director at the charity Young Minds, said: \u201cUsing phones and being online from a young age, including having access to social media accounts, has become a normal part of life for many children. The children and young people we work with tell us about the positives of using technology, but also that being exposed to harmful content or being bullied round the clock on social media can have a serious impact on their mental health.\u201d In a white paper in April on combating online harm, the government pledged to take action to tackle the problem. That included putting a new legal duty of care on providers to ensure that young users do not come to harm from accessing their content.",

      "bodyText": "A US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data breach has exposed travelers\u2019 photos and license plate information, renewing concerns about expanded facial recognition and federal surveillance systems. A \u201cmalicious cyber-attack\u201d hit a CBP \u201csubcontractor\u201d that had stored \u201ccopies of license plate images and traveler images collected by CBP\u201d, the agency said in a statement on Monday. CBP said \u201cnone of the image data has been identified on the dark web or internet\u201d, but declined to answer questions about the scope of the attack and stolen data, and refused to name the subcontractor. The US government maintains vast databases of travelers\u2019 personal information, including passport and visa photos, and airlines have also increasingly used facial recognition technology, sharing biometric data with federal agencies that store the sensitive information. CBP has been expanding its facial-scanning systems to international airports across the country since Donald Trump\u2019s 2017 executive order expediting the deployment of this surveillance. \u201cThis breach comes just as CBP seeks to expand its massive face recognition apparatus and collection of sensitive information from travelers, including license plate information and social media identifiers,\u201d Neema Singh Guliani, American Civil Liberties Union senior legislative counsel, said in a statement. \u201cThis incident further underscores the need to put the brakes on these efforts and for Congress to investigate the agency\u2019s data practices.\u201d The best way to avoid these kinds of breaches, Guliani added, \u201cis not to collect and retain such data in the first place\u201d. A CBP spokesperson declined to comment on the number of people affected and the kind of information compromised, though a government official told the New York Times no more than 100,000 people had their data stolen. The agency sought to cast blame on the subcontractor, saying the unnamed firm violated CBP policies when it \u201ctransferred copies of license plate images and traveler images collected by CBP to the subcontractor\u2019s company network\u201d. CBP said it discovered the issue on 31 May, and that the subcontractor had transferred the data \u201cwithout CBP\u2019s authorization or knowledge\u201d in violation of \u201cmandatory security and privacy protocols outlined in their contract\u201d. The agency has since removed all equipment related to the breach and alerted Congress and other law enforcement agencies to the incident. \u201cCBP will unwaveringly work with all partners to determine the extent of the breach and the appropriate response,\u201d the statement said, adding that no CBP systems were compromised. Privacy activists have been sounding the alarm about the potential for data to be misused as law enforcement agencies, including US immigration authorities, have escalated surveillance of license plate data, travelers\u2019 social media accounts and other private information. Last week, a coalition of activist groups launched a new tool meant to help travelers avoid invasive facial recognition technologies at airports. \u201cEven if you trust the government with your biometric information, which you shouldn\u2019t, once our faces are scanned and stored in a database, they can be stolen and used for nefarious purposes,\u201d said Jelani Drew, a campaigner at Fight for the Future, one of the groups behind the new tool. \u201cThis technology is sold to companies under the lie that [it] makes us more safe, but in fact, it makes us less safe.\u201d In May, San Francisco lawmakers voted to make the city the first in the US to ban police and other government agencies from using facial recognition technology. The state of California and other municipalities across the country are now considering similar proposals.",

      "body": "<p>Boris Becker was 17 when he lit up Wimbledon for the first time, 34 years ago, and he cannot wait for a teenager to win the men\u2019s title again. Indeed he is frustrated that no young star has broken the hold the ageing big three have on the majors.</p> <p>Looking ahead to the 2019 tournament, which starts on 1 July, Becker said on Monday night: \u201cWe are surrounded by [potential] teenage grand slam champions. In any other sport people get younger. For some reason in tennis everybody takes a lot longer to be successful. And that has nothing to do with forehands and backhands. I am convinced it will happen. It should happen. This would be the only sport where it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d</p> <p>When the 33-year-old Rafael Nadal ground down 25-year-old Dominic Thiem<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/09/rafael-nadal-beats-dominic-thiem-wins-french-open-tennis-title\" title=\"\"> for the second year in a row to win the French Open</a> on Sunday, he ensured that ownership of the past 10 majors stayed with the big three: himself, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Between them they have won 53 grand slam events. It was also the 11th major in a row won by a player 30 or older.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/jul/01/john-mcenroe-a-knack-for-creating-controversy-where-there-is-none\">John McEnroe: 'A knack for creating controversy where there is none'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Becker observed: \u201cI was just reading a stat that no active player outside the big three under 28, apart from Thiem [and Milos Raonic in 2016], has been in a grand slam final. That is not good. That is not a compliment for anybody under 28. And don\u2019t give me that the others are too good. We should question the quality and the attitude of everybody under 28. It just doesn\u2019t make sense.</p> <p>\u201cAs much as I respect Roger, Rafa and Novak, young players should show up. Give me something I want to talk about. Eventually they [big three] will be too old. But you want to see the passing of the torch while they are still in their prime. You want to see Stefanos [Tsitsipas] and Dominic beating them when they are still very, very good.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a certain mentality that they [younger players] don\u2019t have, that the three others do have. It\u2019s not the forehands. It\u2019s not the fitness. It\u2019s mind-set, attitude that makes the difference between winning and losing.\u201d</p> <p>Becker created the template. Two weeks after winning Queen\u2019s in 1985 he confirmed that his precocious talent had substance when he beat Kevin Curren in four sets on a sun-dappled Centre Court at the All England Club to become the first unseeded winner of the most famous prize in tennis, as well as the first German.</p> <p>Nobody that young had won a men\u2019s grand slam title \u2013 although Michael Chang would take his record four years later at Roland Garros \u2013 and when Becker overwhelmed Ivan Lendl in straight sets to keep his Wimbledon title in 1986, it looked as if he would be the king of grass for as long as he wanted. It did not exactly work out that way, because of contractual and injury interruptions, and his private life has been seriously complicated. Back then, though, everything seemed so easy and simple to him.</p> <p>It was never straightforward for John McEnroe, who is nine years older than Becker and was 22 when he won the first of his three Wimbledon titles in 1981, two years after breaking through at Flushing Meadows. Loud and defiantly brattish back then, he has mellowed into the <em>\u00e9minence grise </em>of the commentary box, a little quieter but still opinionated. \u201cI have been waiting a long time [for a young male player to win Wimbledon],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as it\u2019s ever been. I would think at Wimbledon it would be more likely [than at the other majors].\u201d</p> <p>He name-checks Tsitsipas \u2013 \u201che would seem to be a likely candidate to make the transition [from clay to grass] immediately\u201d \u2013 as well as the Canadian Denis Shapovalov \u2013 \u201cwho has struggled on the clay and might lack confidence\u201d \u2013 and the Russian Karen Khachanov, who he thought would have \u201cmade more inroads by now\u201d. He added: \u201cA guy like [Daniil] Medvedev, maybe all of a sudden the pressure is on him [to win].\u201d</p> <p>McEnroe says there is another teenager who has the tools to make it: \u201cF\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime has the attitude you need to be the best in the world. Stefanos has that attitude. He is the closest right now. [Alexander] Zverev? He has been the front runner for a while but it seems he hasn\u2019t rounded his game off enough. When the pressure ramps up at the big ones, he gets a little passive. He psyches himself out. The pressure so far has got to him.\u201d</p> <p>All tough judgments but, as Nadal proved in Paris on Sunday, nobody yet seems equal to the challenge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Boris Becker was 17 when he lit up Wimbledon for the first time, 34 years ago, and he cannot wait for a teenager to win the men\u2019s title again. Indeed he is frustrated that no young star has broken the hold the ageing big three have on the majors. Looking ahead to the 2019 tournament, which starts on 1 July, Becker said on Monday night: \u201cWe are surrounded by [potential] teenage grand slam champions. In any other sport people get younger. For some reason in tennis everybody takes a lot longer to be successful. And that has nothing to do with forehands and backhands. I am convinced it will happen. It should happen. This would be the only sport where it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d When the 33-year-old Rafael Nadal ground down 25-year-old Dominic Thiem for the second year in a row to win the French Open on Sunday, he ensured that ownership of the past 10 majors stayed with the big three: himself, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic. Between them they have won 53 grand slam events. It was also the 11th major in a row won by a player 30 or older. As Becker observed: \u201cI was just reading a stat that no active player outside the big three under 28, apart from Thiem [and Milos Raonic in 2016], has been in a grand slam final. That is not good. That is not a compliment for anybody under 28. And don\u2019t give me that the others are too good. We should question the quality and the attitude of everybody under 28. It just doesn\u2019t make sense. \u201cAs much as I respect Roger, Rafa and Novak, young players should show up. Give me something I want to talk about. Eventually they [big three] will be too old. But you want to see the passing of the torch while they are still in their prime. You want to see Stefanos [Tsitsipas] and Dominic beating them when they are still very, very good. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain mentality that they [younger players] don\u2019t have, that the three others do have. It\u2019s not the forehands. It\u2019s not the fitness. It\u2019s mind-set, attitude that makes the difference between winning and losing.\u201d Becker created the template. Two weeks after winning Queen\u2019s in 1985 he confirmed that his precocious talent had substance when he beat Kevin Curren in four sets on a sun-dappled Centre Court at the All England Club to become the first unseeded winner of the most famous prize in tennis, as well as the first German. Nobody that young had won a men\u2019s grand slam title \u2013 although Michael Chang would take his record four years later at Roland Garros \u2013 and when Becker overwhelmed Ivan Lendl in straight sets to keep his Wimbledon title in 1986, it looked as if he would be the king of grass for as long as he wanted. It did not exactly work out that way, because of contractual and injury interruptions, and his private life has been seriously complicated. Back then, though, everything seemed so easy and simple to him. It was never straightforward for John McEnroe, who is nine years older than Becker and was 22 when he won the first of his three Wimbledon titles in 1981, two years after breaking through at Flushing Meadows. Loud and defiantly brattish back then, he has mellowed into the \u00e9minence grise of the commentary box, a little quieter but still opinionated. \u201cI have been waiting a long time [for a young male player to win Wimbledon],\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s as close as it\u2019s ever been. I would think at Wimbledon it would be more likely [than at the other majors].\u201d He name-checks Tsitsipas \u2013 \u201che would seem to be a likely candidate to make the transition [from clay to grass] immediately\u201d \u2013 as well as the Canadian Denis Shapovalov \u2013 \u201cwho has struggled on the clay and might lack confidence\u201d \u2013 and the Russian Karen Khachanov, who he thought would have \u201cmade more inroads by now\u201d. He added: \u201cA guy like [Daniil] Medvedev, maybe all of a sudden the pressure is on him [to win].\u201d McEnroe says there is another teenager who has the tools to make it: \u201cF\u00e9lix Auger-Aliassime has the attitude you need to be the best in the world. Stefanos has that attitude. He is the closest right now. [Alexander] Zverev? He has been the front runner for a while but it seems he hasn\u2019t rounded his game off enough. When the pressure ramps up at the big ones, he gets a little passive. He psyches himself out. The pressure so far has got to him.\u201d All tough judgments but, as Nadal proved in Paris on Sunday, nobody yet seems equal to the challenge.",

      "body": "<p>Sunday afternoon at the Est\u00e1dio D Afonso Henriques stadium and Gareth Southgate found himself once again fielding questions over the level of perceived progress in the year since the World Cup finals. England\u2019s Nations League campaign had delivered another semi-final defeat but a first third-place finish in 51 years, no goals mustered from open play but a second successive penalty shootout success. \u201cBut the biggest sign of progress was the mentality of everyone after the loss to the Netherlands,\u201d the manager said. \u201cOnce we\u2019d calmed all the emotion, the theories as to why we\u2019d lost, the drive was there. We weren\u2019t satisfied and everyone wanted to make sure it was beyond a semi-final next time. That\u2019s the healthiest sign for me.\u201d</p> <p>Southgate will attend the Under\u201121 European Championship in Italy and San Marino, urging on a team who might have called on Dele Alli, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez, before thoughts drift to the autumn Euro 2020 qualifiers to come. So which players impressed during the two-matches in Guimar\u00e3es to establish themselves in the manager\u2019s thoughts and whose stars have waned?</p> <h2><strong>The beneficiaries</strong></h2> <p><strong>1) Trent Alexander-Arnold</strong></p> <p>The Liverpool defender\u2019s display against Switzerland, following on from splendid club form, surely marked him out as England\u2019s right-back for the foreseeable future. The whip and bite of his crossing was a potent weapon, with seven passes generating presentable opportunities for team-mates. \u201cHe was very good in terms of his use of the ball, his technique for his crossing is fantastic,\u201d said Southgate, who first encountered him in the England U-17s. \u201cHe wandered down the other end of the training pitch on Saturday with a bag of balls, put one down, whipped it round the wall into the top corner then just walked off. He\u2019s got great belief in his delivery. There\u2019s still a bit to do defensively on positioning and awareness but, at 20, he\u2019s already played in two Champions League finals. It\u2019s an amazing start.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2) Joe Gomez</strong></p> <p>Another youngster thriving for J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Liverpool, Gomez was spared the Dutch press in the semi-final after an injury-hit season and late arrival after the Champions League success. The Swiss were nowhere near as imposing but the 22-year-old still looked a natural. He is accustomed to collecting the ball from his goalkeeper and looked unflappable when opponents closed in. \u201cThere\u2019s no reward without risk,\u201d he admitted. \u201cPlaying this way is all I know. Before joining the senior set-up I was with Gareth in the under-21s and it was the same philosophy then.\u201d Gomez would have been in the World Cup squad had injury not denied him participation in Russia. On this evidence the natural-born defender will be a fixture for some time to come.</p> <p><strong>3) Harry Winks</strong></p> <p>Winks was not in Portugal having been one of four players cut from the original 27-man party with England\u2019s coaching staff wary of leaning too heavily on a player who had only recently returned after missing eight weeks following groin surgery. Yet the Tottenham midfielder\u2019s reputation soared in absentia. The team\u2019s toils against the Dutch, when they lacked a conductor akin to Frenkie de Jong to dictate the collective tempo, had highlighted everything England craved. Winks has played only 250 minutes at this level and is not necessarily first-choice in the Spurs team but England\u2019s coaching staff have earmarked him as \u201ca player who is comfortable to turn and connect the play when we are working through the offensive phases\u201d, according to the assistant manager, Steve Holland.</p> <h2><strong>Those who lost out</strong></h2> <p><strong>1) Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier</strong></p> <p>Walker has won successive Premier League titles with Manchester City and is a player in whom Southgate has placed considerable trust, whether asking him to operate as a right-sided centre-back at the World Cup or at right-back in a four. Yet his error-strewn display against the Dutch, coupled with Alexander-Arnold\u2019s clear progress and assured showing on Sunday, appears to have left the 29-year-old horribly vulnerable, at least when it comes to being first-choice. Trippier would normally be first in line to step in but he, too, is threatened by Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s emergence at Crystal Palace. Should Wan-Bissaka enjoy a good summer with the under-21s, then it is hard to see the Spurs right-back forcing his way back in.</p> <p><strong>2) John Stones</strong></p> <p>Southgate has already demonstrated he boasts a ruthless streak. The casting aside of Ashley Young and Phil Jones after the World Cup proved as much, as did the manner in which he had initially addressed Wayne Rooney\u2019s captaincy. So John Stones, such a mainstay up until now, will feel far from secure. That is born not so much of the costly error in extra time against the Dutch (which, in truth, was uncharacteristic), but more from the reality the 25-year-old\u2019s status at Manchester City appears to have collapsed. He arrived in Portugal having made only three league starts since mid-February, and none in any competition since mid-April. He was rusty when he arrived and presumably ripe for an error. He needs to re-establish his credentials at the Etihad next season to remain key to the England team.</p> <p><strong>3) Harry Kane</strong></p> <p>No one would suggest the golden boot winner from last summer\u2019s World Cup suddenly finds his place seriously under threat but is there an argument that England need not always pencil him in when he is patently not match fit? Kane was \u201cthe exception\u201d, according to the manager, when it came to selection after a lengthy injury lay-off. That befitted a striker with 17 goals in 17 caps under Southgate, yet the alarm bells had still rung after his leggy display with Spurs in the Champions League final. There was merit to the national team turning instead to the slippery pace of Marcus Rashford, complemented by rapid wingers, in that first game. Might Kane not have benefited from a full summer off, particularly with one eye on Euro 2020, rather than the two-game tournament given the slog of the season he has just endured?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sunday afternoon at the Est\u00e1dio D Afonso Henriques stadium and Gareth Southgate found himself once again fielding questions over the level of perceived progress in the year since the World Cup finals. England\u2019s Nations League campaign had delivered another semi-final defeat but a first third-place finish in 51 years, no goals mustered from open play but a second successive penalty shootout success. \u201cBut the biggest sign of progress was the mentality of everyone after the loss to the Netherlands,\u201d the manager said. \u201cOnce we\u2019d calmed all the emotion, the theories as to why we\u2019d lost, the drive was there. We weren\u2019t satisfied and everyone wanted to make sure it was beyond a semi-final next time. That\u2019s the healthiest sign for me.\u201d Southgate will attend the Under\u201121 European Championship in Italy and San Marino, urging on a team who might have called on Dele Alli, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez, before thoughts drift to the autumn Euro 2020 qualifiers to come. So which players impressed during the two-matches in Guimar\u00e3es to establish themselves in the manager\u2019s thoughts and whose stars have waned? The beneficiaries 1) Trent Alexander-Arnold The Liverpool defender\u2019s display against Switzerland, following on from splendid club form, surely marked him out as England\u2019s right-back for the foreseeable future. The whip and bite of his crossing was a potent weapon, with seven passes generating presentable opportunities for team-mates. \u201cHe was very good in terms of his use of the ball, his technique for his crossing is fantastic,\u201d said Southgate, who first encountered him in the England U-17s. \u201cHe wandered down the other end of the training pitch on Saturday with a bag of balls, put one down, whipped it round the wall into the top corner then just walked off. He\u2019s got great belief in his delivery. There\u2019s still a bit to do defensively on positioning and awareness but, at 20, he\u2019s already played in two Champions League finals. It\u2019s an amazing start.\u201d 2) Joe Gomez Another youngster thriving for J\u00fcrgen Klopp at Liverpool, Gomez was spared the Dutch press in the semi-final after an injury-hit season and late arrival after the Champions League success. The Swiss were nowhere near as imposing but the 22-year-old still looked a natural. He is accustomed to collecting the ball from his goalkeeper and looked unflappable when opponents closed in. \u201cThere\u2019s no reward without risk,\u201d he admitted. \u201cPlaying this way is all I know. Before joining the senior set-up I was with Gareth in the under-21s and it was the same philosophy then.\u201d Gomez would have been in the World Cup squad had injury not denied him participation in Russia. On this evidence the natural-born defender will be a fixture for some time to come. 3) Harry Winks Winks was not in Portugal having been one of four players cut from the original 27-man party with England\u2019s coaching staff wary of leaning too heavily on a player who had only recently returned after missing eight weeks following groin surgery. Yet the Tottenham midfielder\u2019s reputation soared in absentia. The team\u2019s toils against the Dutch, when they lacked a conductor akin to Frenkie de Jong to dictate the collective tempo, had highlighted everything England craved. Winks has played only 250 minutes at this level and is not necessarily first-choice in the Spurs team but England\u2019s coaching staff have earmarked him as \u201ca player who is comfortable to turn and connect the play when we are working through the offensive phases\u201d, according to the assistant manager, Steve Holland. Those who lost out 1) Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier Walker has won successive Premier League titles with Manchester City and is a player in whom Southgate has placed considerable trust, whether asking him to operate as a right-sided centre-back at the World Cup or at right-back in a four. Yet his error-strewn display against the Dutch, coupled with Alexander-Arnold\u2019s clear progress and assured showing on Sunday, appears to have left the 29-year-old horribly vulnerable, at least when it comes to being first-choice. Trippier would normally be first in line to step in but he, too, is threatened by Aaron Wan-Bissaka\u2019s emergence at Crystal Palace. Should Wan-Bissaka enjoy a good summer with the under-21s, then it is hard to see the Spurs right-back forcing his way back in. 2) John Stones Southgate has already demonstrated he boasts a ruthless streak. The casting aside of Ashley Young and Phil Jones after the World Cup proved as much, as did the manner in which he had initially addressed Wayne Rooney\u2019s captaincy. So John Stones, such a mainstay up until now, will feel far from secure. That is born not so much of the costly error in extra time against the Dutch (which, in truth, was uncharacteristic), but more from the reality the 25-year-old\u2019s status at Manchester City appears to have collapsed. He arrived in Portugal having made only three league starts since mid-February, and none in any competition since mid-April. He was rusty when he arrived and presumably ripe for an error. He needs to re-establish his credentials at the Etihad next season to remain key to the England team. 3) Harry Kane No one would suggest the golden boot winner from last summer\u2019s World Cup suddenly finds his place seriously under threat but is there an argument that England need not always pencil him in when he is patently not match fit? Kane was \u201cthe exception\u201d, according to the manager, when it came to selection after a lengthy injury lay-off. That befitted a striker with 17 goals in 17 caps under Southgate, yet the alarm bells had still rung after his leggy display with Spurs in the Champions League final. There was merit to the national team turning instead to the slippery pace of Marcus Rashford, complemented by rapid wingers, in that first game. Might Kane not have benefited from a full summer off, particularly with one eye on Euro 2020, rather than the two-game tournament given the slog of the season he has just endured?",

Or at least four proper ones, and an Esther McVey event that was described as a leadership campaign launch, even though she has had one already. There are no obvious winners or losers, but some themes stand out. Here is my take on eight things we\u2019ve learnt.</p> \n  <p><strong>1) Boris Johnson is dominating the campaign, despite being largely absent from it. </strong>The former foreign secretary is refusing to give broadcast interviews, and his campaigning consists of private talks with MPs, plus the odd intervention in friendly newspapers (mostly the Telegraph, which pays him handsomely for his column). Yet what has been striking today is how all the other contenders are defining themselves in opposition to him, by stressing the need for \u201cserious\u201d leadership or a \u201cfresh\u201d start etc.</p> \n  <p><strong>2) None of the leading candidates can persuasively explain how they will be able to succeed on Brexit where Theresa May failed</strong>. They have their various plans, but they are all versions of the same thing - trying to accept the EU to agree concessions on the backstop that it has already ruled out. It is impossible to say for sure that they will fail, but there is nothing that sounds like inviting the Conservative party to face up to difficult truths.<strong> Faisal Islam</strong>, Sky\u2019s former political editor, says it is like a unicorn grand national.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1138012175128289280\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">V odd this \u201crace to be PM\u201d from afar - tax plans that won\u2019t pass this Parliament, Brexit \u201cplans\u201d that won\u2019t pass Parliament, promise not to have GE - promises being made to tiny selectorate that aren\u2019t in hands of winner to deliver...<br><br>It\u2019s like a unicorn Grand National.</p>\u2014 Faisal Islam (@faisalislam) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1138012175128289280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/faisalislam/status/1138013174488293376\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Actually, probably more like a unicorn Grand National without dope tests...

See <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/10/tory-leadership-boris-johnsons-tax-cut-plan-would-never-get-through-commons-says-leadsom-live-news?page=with:block-5cfe5e4b8f0880dcae93bcad#block-5cfe5e4b8f0880dcae93bcad\">2.48pm.</a> To her credit, the only credit who has put foward a fully costed spending plan seems to be Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary. She would raise \u00a37bn by cutting aid spending, and use the revenue to boost public sector pay, and spend more on the police and education.</p> \n  <p><strong>4) None of the candidates speaking today have been willing to defend Johnson\u2019s plan to cut taxes for the wealthy. </strong>In fact, three of them - <strong>Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab </strong>and <strong>Michael Gove </strong>- criticised it directly. This may be a recognition that directing tax cuts at the most wealthy is impossible to justify in public, although that does not necessarily mean it won\u2019t appeal to the Conservative members who will select the new leader. If you are looking for an analysis of quite how regressive Johnson\u2019s plan is, <a href=\"https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/blog/tax-cuts-for-the-rich-is-not-the-answer-to-the-questions-21st-century-britain-is-asking/\">this Resolution Foundation blog </a>by <strong>Torsten Bell </strong>is good.

Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Until this weekend the biggest I\u2019d seen (again, I may have missed something) have come from Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt. The former wants to spend well in excess of \u00a330bn a year on cutting income tax and national insurance contributions. That certainly would rule out any end of austerity on the spending side if he wanted to keep a lid on national debt, though perhaps he is after a more generally expansionary fiscal policy. If so, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made that clear.</p> \n   <p>Mr Hunt, on the other hand, has talked about dramatic increases in defence spending, saying that it should rise decisively as a fraction of national income. Each additional 1% costs \u00a320bn a year. Again, whether he would fund this from higher taxes, higher borrowing or lower spending on health, education or something else he has not made clear. If we were to increase defence spending in this way, it would represent a dramatic break with recent decades. It is no exaggeration to say that continued falls in defence spending as a fraction of national income over a 60-year period have been central to allowing us to increase spending on health and other parts of the welfare state without significant rises in tax.</p> \n   <p>Michael Gove has now entered the tax and spending fray, illustrating his continued lack of interest in the advice of experts by suggesting that he\u2019d like to abolish VAT. This tax raises nearly \u00a3140bn a year. He\u2019d like to replace it with a sales tax. That would be the biggest, riskiest and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century. He might like to ask himself why the biggest global change in tax in recent decades has seen countries around the world moving in precisely the opposite direction, why every OECD country bar the United States and why 166 countries now have VAT.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He has also been tweeting.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/PJTheEconomist/status/1137964823315193856\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tax and spending promises by leadership candidates: <br> - Raab: \u00a330bn+ tax cut;<br> - Hunt: \u00a320bn+ more spending on defence;<br> - Johnson: \u00a310bn tax cut;<br> - Gove: abolish VAT;<br>Me in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thetimes?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@thetimes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/8JUzyfdPMl\">https://t.co/8JUzyfdPMl</a> on lack of seriousness.

(See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2019/jun/10/tory-leadership-boris-johnsons-tax-cut-plan-would-never-get-through-commons-says-leadsom-live-news?page=with:block-5cfe06db8f084466bb196e54#block-5cfe06db8f084466bb196e54\"> 9.10am.)</a></p> \n  <p>While Johnson\u2019s allies appear to be rowing back on the pledge, the Telegraph reported on Monday morning <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/06/09/boris-johnsons-radical-plan-slash-income-tax-3million-raising/\">he wants to slash income tax rates for up to 3 million higher earners taking home between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 a year</a>.</p> \n  <p>He would partly fund that cut by increasing national insurance payments at 12% up to that new \u00a380,000 ceiling, but that would have disastrous consequences in Scotland, fuelling suspicions Johnson has little interest in Scotland or its delicate constitutional status.</p> \n  <p>Johnson appears to have forgotten that income tax rates are wholly devolved in Scotland and controlled by the Scottish National party government, which has set a new 41p rate which starts at \u00a343,431, not the \u00a350,000 in force in the rest of the UK. So no Scottish taxpayer would benefit from Johnson\u2019s apparent largesse.</p> \n  <p>In fact, they would pay more. Because of a loophole in the devolution settlement, national insurance rates are set at the UK level, which means any increase in NI rates to keep pace with new income tax bands in the rest of the UK has an adverse effect on Scottish taxpayers.</p> \n  <p>In Scotland, because NI payments of 12% have a \u00a350,000 ceiling to match tax rates in the rest of the UK, those earning between \u00a343,431 and \u00a350,000 already pay a higher marginal rate on those earnings of 53%.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s plans mean everyone in Scotland earning between \u00a343,431 and \u00a380,000 will pay a marginal tax rate of 53%. To make matters worse, none of the extra national insurance money generated would go into Scottish spending, a point seized on by the SNP.</p> \n  <p><strong>Angela Constance</strong>, an SNP MSP and former minister, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s priorities are all wrong \u2013 and this latest wheeze is an appalling insight into the future of the country if he gets his way.</p> \n   <p>Scottish taxpayers now face the prospect of paying for a tax cut for the likes of Boris Johnson and his cronies.

He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>What [Johnson] has said is that he wants to raise the point at which you start to pay higher rate tax to \u00a380,000. But at the same time, and this does make sense, you would increase the national insurance ceiling to the same level. So the net cost would be in the order of \u00a310bn a year. That\u2019s obviously a lot of money. It helps the 10% highest earners. And it is worth saying that the group who would benefit the most would be the high-income pensioners who don\u2019t pay national insurance at all.

      "bodyText": "This from my colleague Heather Stewart: All the fun jousting aside, Tom Kibasi from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) shares Michael Gove\u2019s belief that it\u2019s ultimately between Gove and Boris Johnson. I\u2019m going to wrap up now. Goodnight everyone. This just in from Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby: These \u201892 Group endorsements are in stark contrast to the wider party, as the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul has just shared: Leadership contender Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, who will launch his campaign tomorrow, has accused rival candidates of having made \u201creckless\u201d tax and spending pledges. This from the Press Association: [Stewart] said the \u201ceye-watering\u201d cost of his rivals\u2019 promises risked undermining the party\u2019s reputation for economic prudence. According to figures released by Mr Stewart\u2019s campaign team, Dominic Raab is the biggest spender so far with 38.2 billion of tax cuts promised. They include raising the national insurance threshold to 12,500, scrapping stamp duty on homes under 500,000, and a 5p cut in the basic rate of income tax. He was followed by Michael Gove, whose promise to scrap VAT and replace it with a lower and simpler sales tax was put at 20 billion. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to raise the 40% tax threshold from 50,000 to 80,000 was said to cost 14.1 billion, Jeremy Hunt\u2019s promise to cut corporation tax to 12.5% was put at 11 billion, and Sajid Javid\u2019s suggestion he could scrap the top rate of tax was put at 700,000. In all, Mr Stewart said their commitments added up to 84 billion. \u201cWe must restore - for Britain and for the Conservative Party - our reputation for economic and fiscal prudence. We simply cannot make spending and tax cut promises that we can\u2019t keep,\u201d he said. \u201cThis number - of total spending promises by other candidates in this campaign - is eye-watering. We have to be straight with people, truthful on Brexit, and truthful on spending. \u201cWe cannot criticise Jeremy Corbyn for reckless spending pledges if we start doing the same ourselves. Cheap electoral bribes could cost us dear. Our members are smarter than this.\u201d Mr Stewart said he would use the fiscal \u201cheadroom\u201d from a \u201cgood\u201d Brexit deal to invest in education and infrastructure, while borrowing to fund marketable assets such as houses as part of a drive to build two million new homes. Dominic Raab, whose leadership campaign slogan is \u201cFor a fairer Britain\u201d, just posted a video of his Q&amp;A session earlier on Twitter. Asked what exactly he hoped to achieve in regard to the withdrawal agreement, Raab said he planned \u201ca targeted forensic change to the backstop\u201d, and that he was \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to leaving \u201con WTO-terms\u201d if that wouldn\u2019t bring the deal through the House of Commons. My colleague Jessica Elgot has written up how that PLP meeting went for Jeremy Corbyn tonight. Spoiler alert: apparently not very well. And here we have what looks like a plot twist, served hot by the BBC\u2019s Iain Watson: Here is my colleague Polly Toynbee\u2019s take on the final ten in the Tory den: The Conservative MP Lucy Allan has endorsed Sajid Javid\u2019s leadership bid. A very good thread by Sky\u2019s Lewis Goodall on the very different treatments Michael Gove and Boris Johnson have enjoyed in the aftermath of their respective cocaine-gates. My colleagues Rowena Mason and Jessica Elgot on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s very successful first day in the leadership battle - which has propelled him to second place in the race. And here some impressions from the PLP gathering from BuzzFeed\u2019s Hannah Al-Othman: BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg on the PLP meeting: Meanwhile, things at that PLP meeting seem to have escalated somewhat. My colleague Jessica Elgot reports a greatly charged atmosphere and protests from members against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s request that Labour staff and cabinet ministers be not criticised in public. This from the Times\u2019 Patrick Kidd on former defence secretary Michael Fallon\u2019s endorsement of Boris Johnson: This from the Sun\u2019s James Forsyth: Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, has also found blistering words to express the dismay the leadership contest is causing her: We now face nearly two months of political paralysis while we are all subjected to the spectacle of Conservative party infighting. While that is going on, nothing will happen to address the real concerns of people in Britain over public services, the security of their jobs or the climate crisis. The hypocrisy over drug-taking has been quite sickening. That\u2019s matched only by the shamelessness of candidates throwing a few right-wing policy bones to the Conservative party membership, like tax cuts for the better-off, in the hope of buying their support. The comments coming from some leadership contenders on how they would get round parliamentary opposition to a No Deal Brexit are deeply worrying, and show a contempt for parliamentary sovereignty and the democratic process in Britain. When the UK was given a few months extension on the Brexit deadline, the EU warned us to use the time well. This precious time is not being well spent. According to the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg, David Lidington is backing Matt Hancock in the Tory leadership race. This development seems to have stunned quite a few people. The Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope has seized the opportunity to make a dig at Jeremy Hunt, who has had a rather successful day and is, as of today, one of the most dangerous contenders for Boris Johnson. Labour MP Ian Murray has branded Boris Johnson a \u201cgreater threat to the Union than the SNP\u201d after Johnson unveiled a plan to offer tax cuts for the wealthiest in England. Income tax is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, but National Insurance is not \u2013 meaning Scots taxpayers would pay for the tax cuts in England. Murray challenged Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson to distance herself from the proposal. He said: Boris Johnson is a greater threat to the Union than the SNP. When so many people across the UK are suffering in poverty, it is sickening that his priority is massive tax cuts for the wealthiest in society. The fact that hard-pressed workers in Scotland would pay towards the tax cuts is a double blow, and will create deep divisions within the Union. The Tories are playing fast and loose with the Union and can\u2019t be trusted to protect Scotland\u2019s place in the UK. Ruth Davidson must urgently distance herself from this insulting proposal and explain to Scots what she is planning to do about it when he becomes Prime Minister. The SNP has issued a withering attack on the Tory leadership contest, and has said the tone of the Tory leadership debate showed \u201cthe nasty party\u201d was \u201cwell and truly back\u201d. In a statement, the party has accused the Tories of focussing on their own party\u2019s fate, after a battering in the polls at the EU elections, rather than working to find a solution to the Brexit impasse in Parliament. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said: The European Union agreed to a further extension to Article 50 in April, but the Tories have wasted this crucial time to navel-gaze \u2013 leaving the UK rudderless as it hurtles towards a no-deal Brexit; an outcome that would be devastating for Scotland\u2019s jobs, living standards and economy. The tone of the Tory leadership debate has been utterly horrific \u2013 from advocating a hard Brexit, curtailing women\u2019s rights and offering tax cuts to the richest in society, the nasty party is well and truly back. At a time when politicians should be working to find a solution from the Brexit chaos, we have instead seen a fight to drive the Tory party even further to the extremes, highlighting just how detached Westminster is from Scotland\u2019s needs and priorities. Scotland did not vote for Brexit and we should not be forced to suffer the cost of a Tory leadership election at a crucial moment in the Brexit process. The circus that is the Tory leadership race clearly shows just how important it is that the people of Scotland are given a say on their own future. I am confident that when that time comes, people will make clear that Scotland\u2019s interests are best protected as an independent, equal European nation. Hello everyone. I\u2019ll be gathering some reactions to the Tory leadership bids that were launched today, with one eye on the Labour party meeting Jeremy Corbyn is addressing tonight. According to my colleague Jessica Elgot, that meeting is rather interesting. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, has described himself as the \u201canti-Boris\u201d candidate, saying he is the only contender capable of beating the former foreign secretary. He told reporters at Wesminster: I think I am the only person who can beat him. We are facing a very, very fundamental choice. That choice is between Boris\u2019s Brexit and my Brexit, between somebody who is attempting to out-Farage Farage and somebody like me who believes in the centre ground. That\u2019s all from me for tonight. My colleague Jedidajah Otte is taking over now. Earlier today at the launch of a collection of essays Sajid Javid, the home secretary, said the British public would be hard-pressed to elect another Conservative government, which has embarrassed itself over Brexit. He said: If we\u2019re honest, when the next general election comes - whenever it comes - it is going to be incredibly hard for us Conservatives to win ... We haven\u2019t delivered on our second promise at the last general election, which was to leave the EU by the end of March this year, so we look incompetent. And we are very divided - and a divided country does not elect a divided party. He went on to say that the party needed to focusing on delivering Brexit, but that it shouldn\u2019t expect electoral rewards for simply doing its job. If we think we can win the next election just by delivering something that we should have done anyway, we are absolutely kidding ourselves ... Leaving the EU is the easy bit. We have got to reflect why so many people voted the way that they did. Just before the referendum most people rated the EU 7th or 8th on their list, they were more concerned about housing and immigration, the economy and infrastructure, investment and jobs. It\u2019s those frustrations that which led to that historic decision. From the Telegraph\u2019s Christopher Hope Cheryl Gillan, joint acting chairman of the 1922 Committee executive, is now reading out the names of the candidates who have had their nomination accepted. They are: Michael Gove Matthew Hancock Mark Harper Jeremy Hunt Sajid Javid Boris Johnson Andrea Leadsom Esther McVey Dominic Raab Rory Stewart Gillan says there are 10 valid nominations. The official 1922 Committee hustings will be tomorrow and on Wednesday, and the first ballot will be held on Thursday morning. The result will be announced at around 1pm on Thurday. We are about to get an announcement from the 1922 Committee about the candidates who have got enough support to go through to the first ballot of Tory MPs on Thursday. We have had five Tory leadership launches today. Or at least four proper ones, and an Esther McVey event that was described as a leadership campaign launch, even though she has had one already. There are no obvious winners or losers, but some themes stand out. Here is my take on eight things we\u2019ve learnt. 1) Boris Johnson is dominating the campaign, despite being largely absent from it. The former foreign secretary is refusing to give broadcast interviews, and his campaigning consists of private talks with MPs, plus the odd intervention in friendly newspapers (mostly the Telegraph, which pays him handsomely for his column). Yet what has been striking today is how all the other contenders are defining themselves in opposition to him, by stressing the need for \u201cserious\u201d leadership or a \u201cfresh\u201d start etc. 2) None of the leading candidates can persuasively explain how they will be able to succeed on Brexit where Theresa May failed. They have their various plans, but they are all versions of the same thing - trying to accept the EU to agree concessions on the backstop that it has already ruled out. It is impossible to say for sure that they will fail, but there is nothing that sounds like inviting the Conservative party to face up to difficult truths. Faisal Islam, Sky\u2019s former political editor, says it is like a unicorn grand national. 3) The leading contenders are also making promises on tax and spending that are extraordinarily cavalier for a party that prides itself on being able to manage the public finances properly. See what the Institute for Fiscal Studies has to say. See 2.48pm. To her credit, the only credit who has put foward a fully costed spending plan seems to be Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary. She would raise \u00a37bn by cutting aid spending, and use the revenue to boost public sector pay, and spend more on the police and education. 4) None of the candidates speaking today have been willing to defend Johnson\u2019s plan to cut taxes for the wealthy. In fact, three of them - Matt Hancock, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove - criticised it directly. This may be a recognition that directing tax cuts at the most wealthy is impossible to justify in public, although that does not necessarily mean it won\u2019t appeal to the Conservative members who will select the new leader. If you are looking for an analysis of quite how regressive Johnson\u2019s plan is, this Resolution Foundation blog by Torsten Bell is good. It includes this chart. 5) Michael Gove confirmed he is the most polished performer in the contest. Gove is the best debater in the Commons and, although his campaign is faltering and the pressure was obvious at his launch event, he was more eloquent than any of the other candidates, more willing to engage with media questions, and his policy programme was more extensive. 6) Jeremy Hunt has has the most momentum. He probably had the best day. He has unveiled two important cabinet backers, Amber Rudd and Penny Mordaunt, and at his launch he looked like the favourite for the ABB (Anyone But Boris) slot. These are from the Independent\u2019s John Rentoul. 7) Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has made the most quirky and optimistic pitch for the job. \u201cI love people\u201d was his declaration at one point, which may have sounded a bit new age and evangelical, but he came over as less arrogant and hard-edged than his rivals, and probably more likeable. In an odd passage about the need to use \u201cemotionally charged\u201d language (see 10.20am), he also sounded like someone who has thought quite hard how how mainstream politicians can take on populists. The reviews were mixed. The Independent\u2019s Tom Peck was not impressed. But the Mail on Sunday\u2019s Dan Hodges thought Hancock was onto something. 8) The Gove/Johnson relationship has turned nasty. It was all barbs and innuendo, but there was a bitter edge in the way that Gove spoke about Johnson today that we have not heard from him in public - at least since the moment in 2016 when he declared that he did not thing Johnson was fit to be PM. (Even then, the tone was a bit \u2018more in sorrow than in anger\u2019; today there was much more scorn coming through.) Potentially it could get even more unpleasant. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg has spoken to someone who thinks this could have the makings of a feud that could destabilise a future government. Sam Gyimah, the former minister who stood on a platform calling for a second referendum on Brexit, has dropped out of the Tory leadership contest. Presumably that is in recognition of the fact that he could not get eight people to back him publicly for the leadership, although he does not say that explicitly his his statement. Gyimah recently told my colleague Rowena Mason that a growing number of Tory MPs could now see the case for a second referendum, but that they were not willing to say so in public. Andrew Adonis, the anti-Brexit Labour peer, said recently that Gyimah was the only candidate in the contest with a Brexit policy that was credible. Here are the main points from the Michael Gove campaign launch. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, said the wealthy did not need another tax cut. In a clear dig at Boris Johnson, who used his Telegraph column today to call for tax cuts for the wealthy, he said: One thing I will never do as prime minister is to use our tax and benefits system to give the already wealthy another tax cut. It is not clear from this whether Gove was a) ruling any tax cuts that might benefit the rich (which would be tricky, because many general tax cuts, like a cut in the basic rate of income tax, benefit the rich and the poor, unless compensating measures are taken; b) ruling out any tax cuts specifically aimed at the wealthy; or c) saying tax cuts for the poor should take priority. The most probable interpretation is b), which is well beyond what Dominic Raab was promising (he went for c) this morning - see 1.23pm.) Assuming Gove did mean b), this is quite a bold promise for someone hoping to win a Tory leadership contest. He said he would abolish business rates for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He insisted his weekend confession about taking cocaine before he became an MP would not derail his campaign. Asked if it was time to give up, he replied: I\u2019m in it to win it. The one thing that I would say is that there are some fantastic people in this room and, more than that, I\u2019ve been told in the past that I couldn\u2019t succeed. I was told when I led the Leave campaign \u2018you\u2019re only on 33% in the polls, you guys will tank, you\u2019ll lose by a landslide\u2019 and we won. I was told when I was education secretary \u2018you\u2019ll never be able to transform education in this country, it\u2019s eluded every education secretary before you\u2019, but we changed it. I was told when I arrived at the Department for the Environment \u2018do you know what, it\u2019s an impossible task to please all of these people - you\u2019ll either end up upsetting business or losing the trust of green groups\u2019 but actually we were able to bring business and green groups together. So, every time I\u2019ve been given a job I\u2019ve been told it\u2019s impossible and have delivered. He said that, although he wanted to deliver Brexit by 31 October, he would be willing to delay it if necessary. He said insisting on leaving the EU by the end of October even if that meant a no-deal Brexit could lead to the government losing a no confidence vote. He went on: There would be a vote of confidence in the House of Commons that the government would lose, there would be a general election. We would have Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas. So yes, I would be willing to delay for a day, or a week, or whatever is required to get that deal over the line if we were making progress. He criticised Theresa May for triggering article 50 too early. He said: One of may concerns when I was out of government and on the backbenches is that we triggered article 50 without proper plan for Brexit. I have a proper plan to deliver Brexit. He said there had been \u201cmisreporting\u201d of the rules covering class A drug use by teachers when he was education secretary. \u201cIf someone had said that before they entered teaching they had made mistakes, that would be no bar,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been some misreporting about the way in which actually those terms apply to teachers.\u201d He repeatedly criticised or mocked Boris Johnson, who he mostly refused to refer to by name. As well as rejecting Johnson\u2019s tax plan, Gove stressed his own-long term commitment to Euroscepticism (implying Johnson\u2019s Brexit roots were shallow) and he depicted himself as serious (implying Johnson wasn\u2019t). He even ended with some veiled innuendo about Johnson\u2019s sexual proclivities - or, at least a line that was interpreted that way. This is from HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. It is always bad news for politicians when they start being seen by journalists as a laughing stock. Until now that has never been a problem for Michael Gove, but that may now be changing. Here are three examples. From the Economist\u2019s Philip Coggan From BuzzFeed\u2019s Stuart Millar From Good Morning Britain\u2019s Piers Morgan Q: Would you give Boris Johnson a job in cabinet? Gove says he is a \u201cgreat fan\u201d of Johnson. But he says, if he were to form a cabinet, he would discuss his appointments with the Queen first. And that\u2019s it. The Q&amp;A is over. Q: You say there will be a full stop to the backstop. And you also say you will keep the UK together. But you have admitted a no-deal Brexit would threaten the integrity of the UK. Which is more important - Brexit or the union? Gove says the best way to protect the union is to get rid of the backstop. He says he would organise talks to get power-sharing restored in Northern Ireland. He says alternative arrangements could replace the backstop. Q: You say someone who takes drugs cannot be a teacher. So why shouldn\u2019t the same rule apply to you? Gove says the rules have been misunderstood; they do not apply to people who may have taken drugs before becoming a teacher. Q: You have reportedly told colleagues that you would delay Brexit until the end of 2020. How long would you delay it for? Gove says a colleague recently said he was not a true Brexiter. But Gove says he argued for Brexit, and argued against Brussels within government. He paid the price for leading Vote Leave. If he is not a true Brexiter, he does not know what a true Brexiter looks like. Q: You were defending the Iraq war even in 2008, when you said it was a great success. When did you change your mind? And was Ken Clarke right to say that you would start three wars at the same time? Gove says he admires Clarke. In some ways he models himself on him. But Clarke did not get every foreign affairs decision right, he says. He says his position on Iraq has evolved over time. He is now more aware of the heavy responsibility of sending troops into war. Q: Your campaign has lost momentum. Should you give up? Gove says he is in it to win it. He was told when he was running Vote Leave it was impossible to win. As education secretary he was told education reform was impossible. As environment secretary he was told he could not bring environmentalists and business together. He says there are some very good candidates. He expects to get through to the final two. If he does, and Johnson is the other candidate, he will urge Johnson not to pull out. Gove is now taking questions. Q: You have a lot of supporters here. But you must know your campaign is in real trouble. When you were a prominent figure before you became an MP, you thought it was OK to snort cocaine. Then, as justice secretary, you were prepared to send poor people who did the same to jail. People do not like double standards. Gove says he has reflected on this. He would ask people to judge him by what he did as justice secretary. He encouraged people to to accept that people should be given a second chance. Q: What would you do if YOU could not deliver Brexit by 31 October? Gove says he wants to leave by 31 October. But the apparent frontrunner in this race (he does not mention Boris Johnson by name) says he would leave the EU by 31 October come what may, even if a deal were close. That would be wrong, Gove says. It would lead to a general election, because MPs would not accept this. Q: Why should people trust you when you took cocaine but wrote newspaper articles condemning middle-class drug use? Gove says when you make a mistake, you should reflect on what you have done wrong. He has done that, he says. Gove says he will abolish business rates for small- and medium-sized enterprises. He says he would reform planning rules to allow more homes to be built. He says he wants to introduce a system of social care insurance. He calls for a national cybercrime police force to be set up. And he says he would stop \u201cmoney-grubbing lawyers\u201d pursuing legal cases against brave servicemen and women. It is time for a serious leader, he says, someone who can defend conservatism in the TV studios. He is ready to lead, he says. Gove says delivering Brexit will be a challenge. But he has faced challenges throughout his career. If the government delivers Brexit, this can be the best country in the world. He wants to bring people together, particularly in those overlooked families and undervalued communities so important for the Brexit vote. How would he do this? First, by putting the union first. He says he would have a unit in government making the interests of the union central to everything the government does. Second, he says, he would look at VAT, a regressive tax that hits the poor hardest. One thing he will never do as prime minister is use the tax and benefits system to give the already wealthy another tax cut. \u201cThe poor must come first,\u201d he says. Gove says the wealthy do not need any more tax cuts. It was not clear whether he just meant to say he would not prioritise tax cuts for the wealthy, or whether he was ruling out any tax cuts for the wealthy, but a literal reading of what he said would rule out any futher tax cuts for the wealthy. This is, obviously, an attempt to differentiate himself from Boris Johnson. Gove says the challenge for the government is to deliver Brexit. He says he took the leadership of the Vote Leave campaign even though it put his family under strain. He says he did so because, for him, it was personal. His dad\u2019s fish business went to the wall because of the common fisheries policy. (As my colleague Severin Carrell reported at the time, Gove\u2019s father, Ernest, has given an account of what happened at the time that is rather more nuanced than his son\u2019s.) Gove says he has a plan to deliver Brexit. Gove says as education secretary he pushed through change. He expanded academies and promoted free schools. There are now 1.9 million children going to good or outstanding schools, he says. (Full Fact, the factchecking website, has repeatedly questioned this statistic, which is often cited by Theresa May at PMQs. They explain why it is questionable here.) Michael Gove is speaking now. He says it is odd for him to be on a platform with the name Gove on it. He was not born Gove, he says. He was born Graeme Logan, he says. He was adopted. His mother used to say he did not grow under her heart, but in her heart. Being adopted, he knows how fragile life is, he says. That is why he wants to give everyone the chance to succeed. He wants to give opportunity and voice to people in undervalued families. When he became education secretary, he looked at a school that he might have been sent to if he had not been adopted. Only one pupil got five good GCSEs. He wondered what might have happened to him if he had gone there. And he decided, as education secretary, to ensure all pupils could fulfil their potential. At the Gove launch a video is being shown featuring various professionals praising Gove\u2019s record as a reformer in his roles as education secretary, justice secretary and environment secretary. The Conservative MP Kemi Badenoch is introducing Michael Gove. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, is about to launch his leadership campaign. These are from journalists at the launch. These are from Prof Tim Bale, the academic behind the Mile End Institute study of party membership I mentioned earlier. (See 9.49am.) Nick Macpherson, a former permanent secretary at the Treasury, is also in despair at the promises made by Tory leadership candidates. In an article for the Times, reproduced on the IFS website, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says the plans for tax cuts and spending increases coming from Tory leadership candidates will horrify Whitehall. Here is an extract. Until this weekend the biggest I\u2019d seen (again, I may have missed something) have come from Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt. The former wants to spend well in excess of \u00a330bn a year on cutting income tax and national insurance contributions. That certainly would rule out any end of austerity on the spending side if he wanted to keep a lid on national debt, though perhaps he is after a more generally expansionary fiscal policy. If so, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s made that clear. Mr Hunt, on the other hand, has talked about dramatic increases in defence spending, saying that it should rise decisively as a fraction of national income. Each additional 1% costs \u00a320bn a year. Again, whether he would fund this from higher taxes, higher borrowing or lower spending on health, education or something else he has not made clear. If we were to increase defence spending in this way, it would represent a dramatic break with recent decades. It is no exaggeration to say that continued falls in defence spending as a fraction of national income over a 60-year period have been central to allowing us to increase spending on health and other parts of the welfare state without significant rises in tax. Michael Gove has now entered the tax and spending fray, illustrating his continued lack of interest in the advice of experts by suggesting that he\u2019d like to abolish VAT. This tax raises nearly \u00a3140bn a year. He\u2019d like to replace it with a sales tax. That would be the biggest, riskiest and most disruptive change in the tax system in at least half a century. He might like to ask himself why the biggest global change in tax in recent decades has seen countries around the world moving in precisely the opposite direction, why every OECD country bar the United States and why 166 countries now have VAT. He has also been tweeting. A source from the Boris Johnson camp says that, when Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics that the Telegraph\u2019s account of the Johnson tax plan went beyond what Johnson himself said in his Telegraph column (see 12.57pm), that was not a sign that the Johnson campaign is having second thoughts about the policy. It is fully behind the plan as briefed to the Telegraph, the source says. He says Kwarteng was just making an observation based on his own reading of the Johnson article. Boris Johnson faces heavy pressure from the Scottish Tories to rethink his reported plans to raise the threshold for the 40p rate of income tax to \u00a380,000, because it will heavily penalise middle earners in Scotland. (See 9.10am.) While Johnson\u2019s allies appear to be rowing back on the pledge, the Telegraph reported on Monday morning he wants to slash income tax rates for up to 3 million higher earners taking home between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000 a year. He would partly fund that cut by increasing national insurance payments at 12% up to that new \u00a380,000 ceiling, but that would have disastrous consequences in Scotland, fuelling suspicions Johnson has little interest in Scotland or its delicate constitutional status. Johnson appears to have forgotten that income tax rates are wholly devolved in Scotland and controlled by the Scottish National party government, which has set a new 41p rate which starts at \u00a343,431, not the \u00a350,000 in force in the rest of the UK. So no Scottish taxpayer would benefit from Johnson\u2019s apparent largesse. In fact, they would pay more. Because of a loophole in the devolution settlement, national insurance rates are set at the UK level, which means any increase in NI rates to keep pace with new income tax bands in the rest of the UK has an adverse effect on Scottish taxpayers. In Scotland, because NI payments of 12% have a \u00a350,000 ceiling to match tax rates in the rest of the UK, those earning between \u00a343,431 and \u00a350,000 already pay a higher marginal rate on those earnings of 53%. Johnson\u2019s plans mean everyone in Scotland earning between \u00a343,431 and \u00a380,000 will pay a marginal tax rate of 53%. To make matters worse, none of the extra national insurance money generated would go into Scottish spending, a point seized on by the SNP. Angela Constance, an SNP MSP and former minister, said: Boris Johnson\u2019s priorities are all wrong \u2013 and this latest wheeze is an appalling insight into the future of the country if he gets his way. Scottish taxpayers now face the prospect of paying for a tax cut for the likes of Boris Johnson and his cronies. That would be entirely indefensible \u2013 and is only likely to see a further rise in support for independence, which would give Scotland full powers over tax. Assuming Johnson pressed ahead with this, it would sabotage the Scottish Tories\u2019 claims it is the low tax party in Scotland, putting paid to any lingering fantasy that party leader Ruth Davidson has of replacing Nicola Sturgeon as first minister. And here are the main points from the Jeremy Hunt launch. Hunt, the foreign secretary, has implied that Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy could lead to the Tories being \u201cannihilated\u201d at the next general election. That would happen if Johnson\u2019s promise to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October at the latest led to MPs opposed to no deal triggering an early general election, he said. (See 12.01pm.) He claimed the EU would be willing to offer the UK an acceptable Brexit deal. EU leaders now accepted there could be no Brexit deal including the current backstop plan, he said. (See 12.07pm.) They understand that the backstop is not going to get through parliament. In an implicit dig at Johnson, Hunt said he was a \u201cserious\u201d leader who could get a deal done. This extremely serious moment calls for an experienced, serious leader. We need the art of tough negotiation, not the art of empty rhetoric. And faced with bad choices, we need a prime minister who can negotiate some better choices. Which is what I will strive to do with every fibre in my being because having talked to many European leaders I do believe that if we show determination, ingenuity and confidence, there is a deal to be done. He said he would draw up a plan to abolish illiteracy. (See 12.03pm.) He reaffirmed his commitment to increase defence spending - but without saying he wanted to double it, as he has done in the past. (See 12.04pm.) He was introduced by Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary, who said he had the experience, values and plan to deliver Brexit. She said: I trust him on Brexit because I have seen him in cabinet over the last year. It\u2019s true he has credibility from all sides, but he also took a side. He fought for a deal but also knew that we had to leave no deal on the table to secure a good deal. Mordaunt\u2019s endorsement is valuable partly because she is a leaver (Hunt voted remain), and partly because she is a well-regarded relative newcomer who was seen as a potential leadership candidate herself. Esther McVey has officially launched her leadership bid with a speech to the ultra-Brexit Bruges Group in which she pledged to deliver no deal by not allowing MPs any votes on the departure process before the 31 October deadline. The former work and pensions secretary conceded she was \u201can outsider\u201d to win, but said she had the eight MPs\u2019 nominations needed to get on to the first stage of the ballot. The event, at a lecture theatre in Westminster, was disrupted briefly between her speech and the media Q&amp;A when a man stormed the stage to yell that the people attending were \u201cfake news\u201d. It was not clear what he was objecting to, and he later left the venue. Asked how she would ensure her plan for a no-deal Brexit happened when MPs had previously opposed the idea, McVey \u2013 who has refused to rule out proroguing the chamber \u2013 said she would deny them any votes on the issue: The prime minister kept bringing motions back to the floor, and that allowed people to put amendments to it, that allowed what precipitated going forwards. And that\u2019s when you saw the antics of Yvette Cooper and Oliver Letwin, turning parliament on its head. But that only happened because the prime minister kept bringing back motions to the floor of the house. So, really, we need to stop bringing things to the floor of the house, and the default position is to leave [the EU] through article 50. What has happened is that people who have wanted to deny the will of the people, they have done absolutely everything to do so. What I am now seeking to do is make sure, as a public servant, we deliver what the public were offered. Rory Stewart, the international development secretary, has told the World at One he has secured the eight nominations needed to ensure he will be on the ballot for the first round of voting by Tory MPs on Thursday. Earlier I said the first ballot among MPs was tomorrow. Sorry, that was a mistake. Tomorrow is the first round of hustings organised by the Conservative 1922 Committee. The first round of voting is on Thursday, followed by subsequent votes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week. Here are the main points from the Dominic Raab launch. Raab said that he would prioritise tax cuts for the low paid, arguing that Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a tax cut for higher rate tax players would reinforce \u201cthe caricature that you\u2019re the party of privilege and you are only in it to help the wealthy\u201d. In his speech at the launch he said his priority would be to lift the national insurance threshold, taking the low paid out of tax altogether. He said: I believe capitalism is there to serve the innovative start-up. The striving worker who hasn\u2019t had a pay rise in several years, And the hard-pressed consumer feeling the pinch of the cost of living. I want a fairer deal for workers. So, I\u2019d raise the threshold for employee\u2019s National Insurance, to take the lowest paid out of payroll taxes altogether \u2013 a pay rise for the nurse getting up at 5am to catch the bus to work, For the Dad flipping burgers until late saving to take his family on holiday. I want them to know that we\u2019re on their side. This marks a shift by Raab. Earlier in the contest he called for the basic rate of income tax to be cut by up to 5p in the pound \u2013 a policy that would not benefit the very low paid, who tend not to pay income tax. Raab described himself as \u201cthe conviction Brexiter with the plan\u201d, suggesting that Johnson and his other rivals were just offering \u201cbluff and bluster\u201d. In his speech he said: We\u2019re up against it, and we won\u2019t get Brexit delivered with bluff and bluster. I\u2019m the conviction Brexiteer with the plan, the discipline and the focus to lead us out by the end of October. I would return to Brussels and make a best final offer to replace the Backstop based on the Malthouse compromise, relying on technology, operational cooperation and global practice. With goodwill on all sides, it can be made to work in everyone\u2019s interests. He said he was not proposing any changes to abortion laws. In a dig at Jeremy Hunt, he said that his personal views on abortion was consistent with what he would push for as PM. (Hunt has said that he privately favours reducing the legal time limit for abortions from 24 weeks to 12 weeks, but he would not push for parliament to legislate for this.) Raab said he did not think Michael Gove should quit the leadership contest because of his admission about taking cocaine before he became an MP. On the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics the Tory minister Kwasi Kwarteng, who is on the programme as a Boris Johnson supporter, has just offered what might be the first hint of a climbdown by Johnson on tax cuts for the wealthy. Faced with complaints about Johnson\u2019s policy being a handout to the rich, Kwarteng said Johnson\u2019s Telegraph column today (paywall) does not include a commitment to increase the higher rate tax threshold to \u00a380,000. His column just talks about the need to raise thresholds \u201cso that we help the huge numbers that have been captured in the higher rate by fiscal drag\u201d. The \u00a380,000 figure was in the Telegraph\u2019s splash (paywall), written by the paper\u2019s highly regarded deputy political editor, Steven Swinford. Given the fact that Johnson is the paper\u2019s best-paid columnist, it is impossible to believe that the paper would have splashed on the details of these tax cut plans without the approval of the Johnson campaign (which has not challenged the story in any way). Any claim that this is not actually what Johnson is proposing would be hard to credit. Q: What do you say to people who think you are just continuity May? Hunt says he would be quite different from previous prime ministers. Q: Will you commit to holding monthly press conferences if you become PM? Hunt says he will not commit to that. But he thinks the way leaders communicate with the public has to change. He plans to say more about that as the campaign goes on. (Last week Hunt praised the way Donald Trump used Twitter, saying that, although the US president\u2019s tweets were controversial, at least the public knew what was on his mind as he arrived for work every morning.) The Hunt press conference is now over. I will post a summary and reaction. Q: Will you delay if you do not have a deal by 31 October? Hunt says a wise PM will make choices on the basis of the options available at the time. But we don\u2019t know what those options are. But he will never take action to provoke an election before Brexit has been delivered, because that would be fatal to the Tories, he says. Hunt says if the UK goes to the EU with a hardline stance, it will get a hardline response. Q: What are EU leaders saying to you that makes you think they want to change their stance on the backstop? Hunt says EU leaders are clear that they want a deal. There must be no infrastructure on the Irish border. But there is a clear desire to do a deal that would deliver that. Q: Will your stance on abortion put off women? Hunt says he does not want to change the law on abortion. Q: Do you have any deadline for getting a Brexit deal? Hunt says he has always been clear that, if the only way to deliver Brexit is no deal, he will accept that. But he does not think parliament would accept that. So it is not a credible threat. He says it would not make sense to go to the EU with a threat that is not credible. He will try to deliver a deal by 31 October. Q: Have you ever broken the law? Hunt says he is racking his brains ... but the answer is no. Hunt is now taking questions. Q: You say you are serious. Is there anyone in the contest who is not serious? Hunt says, if the UK wants a deal, it will have to engage seriously with Brussels. He thinks there is a deal to be done. He says what has changed is that the EU now understands the backstop will not get through parliament. He thinks they did not accept that before. Hunt claims EU leaders now accept the Brexit deal cannot include the current backstop plan. Hunt says he has a five-point plan for young people. How can the party of aspiration turn its backs on our most aspirational people? So yesterday I published five pledges for young people. Mental health support in every school and a crackdown on social media companies that promote self-harm. A cut in the interest rate paid on tuition fees. 1.5m new homes for young people. Pollution-free cities in 10 years. And help for graduate entrepreneurs. I want young people everywhere to know that a Conservative government is there for you. Hunt turns to defence. My dad was in the navy throughout the cold war. We followed him from Devon to Scotland to Portsmouth to Surrey. When the Berlin Wall came down he had the sweetest win any military man could ever hope for: victory without firing a single shot. While Jeremy Corbyn was marching for CND, my father and many others were marching for freedom. That victory came because Britain, America and our Nato allies recognised that peace comes through prosperity and through strength. I passionately want the United Kingdom to continue its global vocation. But there is a price to paid for that. We need properly funded armed forces. Which is why, with a more aggressive Russia and a more autocratic China, I pledge to increase the percentage of our GDP we spend on defence alongside maintaining our commitment to 0.7% on international development. Hunt restates his commitment to increasing defence spending. Hunt says he would draw up a plan to abolish illiteracy. Not the 50% of school leavers who go to university and generally get an excellent education. But the 50% who don\u2019t. Too many of them leave education unable to read or add up properly and without the qualifications to get a well-paid job. So I will negotiate a long-term plan with the teaching profession: more funding in return for a guarantee that we will be the first generation to abolish illiteracy and ensure no one leaves our education system without a rigorous qualification sufficient to work up to at least the average salary. Turning to Brexit, Hunt says he is someone who has been negotiating his whole life. I\u2019ve always said I would be prepared to leave without a deal if there was a straight choice between no deal and no Brexit. But I would do so with a heavy heart because of the risks to businesses and the unions. And I would not do so if a deal that commands the support of parliament was in sight. But parliament has made clear its intentions to take no deal off the table no matter what the new prime minister says or does. So without a deal any prime minister who promised to leave by a certain date would have to call a general election to change the parliamentary arithmetic. An election we would lose badly. Because the lessons of the European and Peterborough elections are clear: if we fight an election before delivering Brexit, we will be annihilated. Squeezed by the Brexit party on the right and the Lib Dems on the left we simply allow Labour through the middle. And if that happened nationally it would be the end of Brexit. Because whatever else a Labour government did \u2013 and I worry about all of it \u2013 it would never deliver Brexit. So we need to get real. We are facing a constitutional crisis. Our new prime minister will still preside over a hung parliament. This extremely serious moment calls for an experienced, serious leader. Hunt implies Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit policy could lead to the Tories being \u201cannihilated\u201d at an early general election. Hunt describes himself as a \u201cserious leader\u201d, in implicit contrast to Johnson. Hunt pays tribute to Theresa May (unlike Matt Hancock and Dominic Raab in their speeches this morning). History will be more generous to her than the newspapers today because, alongside her setbacks in parliament, it will also record her extraordinary dedication to party and country alongside her wholehearted commitment to delivering the referendum result. And he pays tribute to Margaret Thatcher. I\u2019ve been a cabinet minister for nine years and have had the privilege of serving two prime ministers. But I\u2019d be different to both. I\u2019d be the first prime minister who has been an entrepreneur \u2013 creating hundreds of jobs in a way that goes to the heart of what we as a party stand for. Margaret Thatcher inspired others to go into politics but in my case she inspired me to start a business. I will never forget having the great honour of thanking her for this in person shortly before she passed away. Jeremy Hunt is speaking now. He says, if the Conservatives do not deliver Brexit, there will be no Conservative government, and possibly no Conservative party. He says delivering Brexit and having a future are not two separate challenges for the party; they are the same challenge, he suggests. Penny Mordaunt, the Brexiter defence secretary who at one point had been expected to stand herself, is now speaking at the Jeremy Hunt launch. She says the next Tory leader faces a huge task. My name will be on Jeremy Hunt\u2019s nomination papers today, She says she Hunt has the experience, values and plan to deliver Brexit. She says he took a side. But he argued we had to keep no-deal on the table to get a deal. And she has seen him deliver on other issues too, she says. He delivered extra funding for the NHS. She has seen him succeed at the Foreign Office. And Hunt has the \u201chumility\u201d to know that there will be people who did not vote Tory who are watching the party find a new leader. The party has to be aware of them, she implies. And she says, as defence secretary, security is particularly important. She say she trusts him on this. (Hunt\u2019s pledge to double defence spending has clearly paid off.) Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, is introducing Jeremy Hunt at his campaign launch. She says she has concluded that he is the \u201coutstanding candidate\u201d in the contest. She says she has known Hunt since she came into politics. She knows him as a man of decency and integrity. Michael Gove\u2019s admission that he took cocaine before becoming an MP does not appear to worry Theresa May too much. At the No 10 lobby briefing the prime minster\u2019s spokesman confirmed May still had confidence in her environment secretary. He said: The secretary of state has said he considers himself to have made a mistake which he profoundly regrets. He set out that he believes the drugs trade is wrong, that drugs wreck lives and he explained that was one of the reasons he decided to enter office \u2013 to try to help people to move away from that. From the prime minister\u2019s point of view, she continues to have full confidence in Michael Gove and the job which he is doing. Pressed on whether Gove\u2019s drugs use exposed hypocrisy considering the harsh rules he introduced for teachers found in possession of drugs, the spokesman refused to comment. Q: Do you want to change the abortion laws? Raab says he supports the current laws and does not want to change them. And that is it. The Raab launch is over. Jeremy Hunt is about to hold his launch. Q: Do you think Michael Gove should stay in the leadership contest? And do you have emotional intelligence of the kind Matt Hancock was talking about earlier? Raab says he does have emotional intelligence. And that is why he is saying Gove should stay in the leadership contest. Q: What can you offer that Boris Johnson can\u2019t? Raab says he does not want to speak ill of any candidate. But it is time for a change, he says. And he says he can help the Tories win support from low-income voters because he will prioritise them with his tax cuts. People will not be able to say the Tories only care about the privileged, he says. He also says it would be hard for Boris Johnson\u2019s tax cut to get through the Commons. He says his plan is the right thing to do, and the smart thing to do. Raab says Boris Johnson\u2019s tax plan suggests Tories only care about the wealthy. Raab is now taking questions. Q: [From the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg] You say you cannot deliver Brexit with bluff and bluster. But isn\u2019t this exactly what you are offering? Raab says he has a forensic plan for delivering Brexit without a backstop. He says a no-deal departure is plausible. The Institute for Government says it would be near impossible for MPs to block a no deal. He says he is the only candidate who is not taking options off the table. If you take options off the table, you will weaken the UK\u2019s negotiating position. Raab says the Labour party has a point about people feeling that capitalism does not work for them. He says he wants to ensure that capitalism works for the little guy. And he says he is \u201con the side of the lowest paid, not the wealthy\u201d. He would raise the national insurance threshold, he says, taking the lowest paid out of tax altogether. This would benefit someone like the nurse getting up at 5am for work, he says. Raab claims he would prioritise tax cuts for the lowest paid. Previously Raab has called for the basic rate of income tax to be cut by up to 5p in the pound \u2013 a policy that would not benefit the very low paid, who tend not to pay income tax. Raab says he does not want a WTO Brexit. But the EU will only offer a deal if it thinks the UK is serious about no deal, he says. Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, is speaking at his campaign launch now. He says Britain has suffered a lose of nerve. It has been \u201chumiliated\u201d in the Brexit talks. If the Tories fail, Jeremy Corbyn will become prime minister, he says. He says Corbyn is someone who has given succour to racists. The country needs new leadership, he says. He says the Tories want to move on from Brexit. But, on Brexit, he says as Brexit secretary he turned up in Brussels every week and told Michel Barnier and his team things they did not want to hear. He says, if the UK had had a united team, it would have already left the UK on acceptable terms. He says the UK will not deliver Brexit on \u201cbluff and bluster\u201d. He will deliver Brexit. He is the \u201cBrexiteer you can rely on\u201d, he says. (This is a dig at Boris Johnson.) Raab says he would go to Brussels and demand a Brexit based on the Malthouse compromise. And he would insist on collective responsibility in government, he says. This has been missing for \u201cfar too long\u201d. Here are the main points from Matt Hancock\u2019s launch. Hancock, the health secretary, implicitly criticised Boris Johnson\u2019s tax cut plan by saying that all candidates should show how they would reduce the deficit, that any tax cuts should be for everyone, and that they should only be introduced \u201cwhen we can afford it\u201d. (See 10.37am.) He rejected claims that the Tories had to have a Brexiter as leader, saying if they just became a Brexit party, they would be finished. He criticised Dominic Raab for not ruling out proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Commenting on Brexit, he said: My Brexit delivery plan is the only credible plan that can deliver Brexit by the 31st of October with the support both of the European Union and the House of Commons \u2013 that is just the reality of the situation. Some have said \u2018stick with the current plan\u2019, but the current plan has been seen to fail. Others say \u2018let\u2019s just run at no deal\u2019, but the brutal truth is we know that no deal will not get through the House of Commons. And then there\u2019s this idea from some people that to deliver Brexit we should suspend our parliamentary democracy \u2013 that we should prorogue parliament. But that goes against everything that those men who waded on to those beaches [on D-day] fought and died for, and I will not have it. He described himself as a \u201cfresh start\u201d candidate with the mantra \u201cmove fast and make things happen\u201d. (See 10.11am and 10.20am.) He rejected populism but said it was important for politicians to be able to described their ideas in \u201cemotionally charged\u201d language. (See 10.20am.) Esther McVey, the former work and pensions secretary, says she has got the eight backers she needs to be on the ballot when MPs hold the first round of voting on Thursday. Here is Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s SNP first minister, on the Tory leadership election. The ITV live feed has just cut out, just as Hancock was answering the final question. I will post a summary shortly. Q: What did you mean when you said you would offer an \u201cemotionally charged platform\u201d? (See 10.20am.) Hancock says they discussed this line in some detail when drafting the speech. He says he was acknowledging that people respond more to emotional arguments than to rational ones. Hancock says all Tory leadership candidates should have to show how they would continue to reduce the deficit. He says he does want tax cuts, but they should benefit everyone. And they should only be proposed when affordable, he says. Q: Who do you trust more - Michael Gove or Jeremy Hunt? Hancock says he trusts them both. When pressed, he refuses to pick one over the other. It would be like having to choose between his children, he says. Hancock has just said the UK is doing well. We have more unicorns here than in the rest of Europe, he says. He is using the term unicorn to refer to a tech start-up valued at $1bn. But in the Brexit debate the term is used to refer to a fantasy proposition. Many would say that, using this definition, Hancock\u2019s claim was also correct. Q: How long are you willing to delay Brexit for? Hancock says he thinks he can deliver Brexit by the end of October. He is not running to fail, he says. Q: Doesn\u2019t the party need to be led by a Brexiter? Hancock says he disagrees. The party needs to deliver Brexit. But if it is just defined by Brexit, it will fail to attract majority public support in the long term. Hancock is now taking questions. Q: Should Michael Gove stay in this race after his cocaine admission? Hancock says it is \u201cabsolutely right\u201d for Gove to stay in this race. He says people are entitled to a private life before politics. People should not be shut out of politics because of a past indiscretion. He says we need as many people as possible in politics. (This is very different from the answer Andrea Leadsom gave to this question this morning. See 9.32am.) Q: Aren\u2019t you being optimistic thinking you can win? Hancock says in Tory leadership contests the frontrunner has never won. He says he is making his case with optimism. He says he will hold a photoshoot with MP supporters this afternoon. Journalists will be surprised by some of the people endorsing him, he says. Hancock says his campaign has faced three objections. People say we need a Brexiter. But the Tories need to choose a leader who can win the support of votes once Brexit is over, he says. People says the next leader has to be one of the best-known candidates. But the party needs a leader for the future, he says. And people say, at 40, he is too young. Hancock says, having watched two prime ministers closely, he knows how difficult this job is. You can only go for it if you think in your heart you are ready, he says. Sky News has given up its live coverage of the Hancock launch, with Sky\u2019s presenter, Adam Boulton, saying Matt Hancock may claim to know about technology, but he does not know about lighting. (The TV pictures are poor, because Hancock is not well lit.) But there is a live feed here. Here is another extract from Hancock\u2019s speech, released by his campaign team in advance overnight. (The ellipses [dots] are from the original text.) The mantra of Silicon Valley is \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d. But things that really matter are starting to break. Like our sense of national community. The self esteem of children. The possibility of civilised debate. Our sense of relevance and meaning and belonging in a world of algorithms and machines. In their place come the threat of automation. Poor mental health. Angry ideologies clashing on social media ... ... dividing communities, unpicking the fabric of our Union. And while liberal ideas defeated both fascism and communism in the last century ... .... it\u2019s clear that today our collective faith in the liberal story is being challenged by massive disruption. We can\u2019t allow this sane, sensible country to enter a new age of nihilism and narrow nationalism. So I refuse to be the leader offering simplistic or populist solutions to such profound change. Instead, an emotionally charged platform to improve lives, rooted in objective fact. Some people say these changes are too big and too inevitable for us to do anything about it. I say no. We are masters of our own destiny. We can win this fight. Ultimately, the success of liberal democracy and our way of life depends on it. We can and must work with this change, master it, bend it to our benefit. Not \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d - that\u2019s wrong. My mantra is \u201cmove fast and make things happen\u201d. Turning to Brexit, Hancock implicitly criticises Dominic Raab for threatening to prorogue Brexit to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. He says that would dishonour what those who sacrificed their lives at D-day gave their lives for. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is speaking at his campaign launch. He says, although politics is not working, in other areas of life people are finding solutions to the problems facing the country. Millennials are more likely to start a business than people from any other generation, he says. He says there are just 60m people in Britain. But they produce the music listened to by 6bn people around the world. But the dark clouds over Westminster this morning (the weather is a bit grim in London) is a metaphor, he says. Underneath the dark clouds, Britain is a great country. He says he is standing because this country needs a \u201cfresh start\u201d. He says he is an optimist. He believes the world is getting better. \u201cI love people,\u201d he says. He says, if you look inside everyone\u2019s heart, there is something of value. Every single person, every person in this room, each and every one of you, everyone has something to give. And it\u2019s the role of government to unlock that potential and allow people to fly as high as their aspirations can take them. Now not everyone believes this. But I know, I know, that if you look inside the heart of every person there is something of value, and it\u2019s our job to help them release it. And that\u2019s what politics should be: at the service of people. He says people alive today are less likely to be involved in war than at any time in the past. And he says, if asked when they would like to be alive, people would choose now - because life is better than it was in the past. Selecting Boris Johnson or another hard Brexiter to be Conservative party leader is a vote for an early general election, Amber Rudd has warned as the crowded contest finally begins in earnest. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, the work and pensions secretary, who has announced she is backing Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, to succeed Theresa May, criticised Johnson\u2019s trenchant attitude towards leaving the EU on 31 October, saying: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not enough if you haven\u2019t got a plan behind it.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has criticised Boris Johnson for proposing a tax cut that would beneft the wealthy. In a statement he said: With our schools, care for the elderly and our police services at breaking point, Boris Johnson\u2019s proposals to give a tax cut to high earners reveals how out of touch the Tories are. As predicted the Tory leadership contest is becoming a race to the bottom in tax cuts. Labour will put the responsibility for repairing our public services on the Top 5% and corporations, not add to the handouts the government has already given the richest in society. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said that Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a tax cut for high earners would be particularly advantageous to wealthy pensioners. He explained: What [Johnson] has said is that he wants to raise the point at which you start to pay higher rate tax to \u00a380,000. But at the same time, and this does make sense, you would increase the national insurance ceiling to the same level. So the net cost would be in the order of \u00a310bn a year. That\u2019s obviously a lot of money. It helps the 10% highest earners. And it is worth saying that the group who would benefit the most would be the high-income pensioners who don\u2019t pay national insurance at all. So there\u2019s a particular group who do particularly well - that\u2019s those over the age of state pension age with more than \u00a380,000 a year. By remarkable coincidence, wealthy pensioners are disproportionately represented amongst the Conservative party membership, the group that will select the next leader. According to a study of party membership published last year (pdf) by academics from the Mile End Institute, the average age of Conservative party members is 57 and 44% of them are above the age of 65. The same study says 86% of members are social class ABC1 (ie, middle class). Here are some more lines from Andrea Leadsom\u2019s interview on the Today programme this morning. Leadsom hinted that Michael Gove\u2019s admission that he took cocaine before he became an MP disqualified him from being the next Tory leader. Asked if she thought it was appropriate for him to remain a candidate given this admission, she declined to say yes. Instead she said questions like this were \u201ca matter for each individual\u201d. And she went on: I certainly think that we need to ensure that we continue with our very strict drug policies in this country. I think it does untold harm to young people - not only drug-taking, but also getting caught up in some of the drug crime, and gang crime. And I think it\u2019s a grave concern for all politicians. Leadsom insisted she would get enough support (the backing of eight other MPs) to be on the ballot in the first round of voting on Thursday. She defended her plan to push for a so-called \u201cmanaged no-deal\u201d, saying the withdrawal agreement was dead. She said: The withdrawal agreement is dead. It\u2019s been tested three times in parliament. There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to go through. So, what I\u2019m proposing is is a three-step plan to a managed exit. Over the next fortnight the Conservative parliamentary party will decide which of the 11 candidates who say there are still running to replace Theresa May as prime minister (and anyone else who joins the contest in the next eight hours) will be on the shortlist of two that gets put to a ballot of members. Given the fact that Boris Johnson has established himself as the runaway favourite (partly by being uncharacteristically organised, and partly because the many Tory MPs who have strong reservations about him have given up hope of trying to block him because they have concluded that his victory is inevitable), the real contest is probably the one to establish who will be up against him. Six candidates have already passed the threshold (the backing of eight other Tory MPs) needed to ensure they are on the ballot for the first round of voting by MPs on Thursday. They are (with the number of backers according to the latest ConservativeHome tally in brackets): Boris Johnson (61) Michael Gove (34) Jeremy Hunt (34) Dominic Raab (24) Sajid Javid (19) Matthew Hancock (12) We will find out today whether the other five have made it. They are: Mark Harper (7) Esther McVey (6) Rory Stewart (6) Sam Gyimah (4) Andrea Leadsom (4) Today four candidates are formally launching their campaigns. But the headlines this morning have been dominated by Johnson, who has been almost invisible in public in recent weeks (avoiding interviews and media scrutiny is a classic frontrunner\u2019s tactic) but who has used the Daily Telegraph today to propose a massive tax cut for high earners. Rowena Mason has the details here. In an interview on the Today programme, one of Johnson\u2019s rivals, the Brexiter former leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom, said there was no chance of this plan getting through the Commons ahead of a general election. She explained: I\u2019m certainly a low-tax Conservative, I want to see people getting to keep more of their hard-earned income. But the reality is, having been leader of the Commons for the last two years, there is a raft of just secondary legislation sitting in abeyance because we don\u2019t have the parliamentary numbers to get any chances through, even quite modest changes in costs of things, chargers for things. So I think in reality in this parliament it would be impossible to get actual wholesale tax changes through. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, formally launches his campaign for the Conservative leadership. 11am: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, formally launches his campaign. 11am: Dominic Raab, the former Brexit secretary, formally launches his campaign. 1pm: Sajid Javid, Penny Mordaunt, Hancock, Raab and George Freeman speech at the launch of a collection of essays, Britain Beyond Brexit, published by the Centre for Policy Studies, a conservative thinktank. 2.30pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 2.50pm: Michael Gove, the environment secretary, formally launches his campaign. 5pm: Nominations for the Conservative leadership close. About an hour or so later the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee will announce how many candidates have got enough support (the backing of eight other MPs) to be allowed to enter the first ballot. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web, although I will be focusing mostly on the Tory leadership contest. I plan to post a summary when I wrap up at the end of the day. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe round-up of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

And Keeley Hawes is in it.</p> <p>The idea also sounds promising. It has been described as a Victorian version of The Sweeney, but it is really more like Ripper Street played for laughs: a heady mix of period detail, gleeful anachronism and baroque profanity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/05/matt-berry-year-of-the-rabbit-toast-electric-sex-pants\">Toast star Matt Berry: 'Nobody wants to hear about my psychic wound'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Detective Inspector Rabbit (Berry) is a rough, hard-drinking, one-eyebrowed (not a monobrow; a dog chewed the right one off) copper, newly saddled with a rookie partner (Freddie Fox). They are in turn shadowed by the chief inspector\u2019s daughter Mabel (Susan Wokoma), who is determined to become the Met\u2019s first female police officer.</p> <p>In the opening scene, we see Rabbit roundly abusing a suspect: threatening him, planting evidence in his pocket, and finally slamming his head nose-first on to the desk. We then pull back to discover that Rabbit is actually demonstrating what policemen do all day for a classroom full of schoolchildren, using their teacher as a stand-in. \u201cNow,\u201d he says. \u201cWho wants to see how we fish opium out of sailors\u2019 arseholes?\u201d Little hands shoot up.</p> <p>Shortly after this moment, my predisposed goodwill towards Year of the Rabbit began to ebb.

It is not even clear whether he is good at his job, or hopelessly incompetent. He is insufficiently deluded \u2013 unlike Berry\u2019s more masterly comic creation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/nov/19/toast-of-london-tv-review-matt-berry\">Toast</a> \u2013 to hold your sympathy from one scene to the next.

      "bodyText": "On paper, there is a lot to like about period police comedy Year of the Rabbit (Channel 4). For a start, it stars Matt Berry, also currently playing a vampire in the TV version of What We Do in the Shadows. The writers, Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley, have won Emmys for their work on Veep. And Keeley Hawes is in it. The idea also sounds promising. It has been described as a Victorian version of The Sweeney, but it is really more like Ripper Street played for laughs: a heady mix of period detail, gleeful anachronism and baroque profanity. Detective Inspector Rabbit (Berry) is a rough, hard-drinking, one-eyebrowed (not a monobrow; a dog chewed the right one off) copper, newly saddled with a rookie partner (Freddie Fox). They are in turn shadowed by the chief inspector\u2019s daughter Mabel (Susan Wokoma), who is determined to become the Met\u2019s first female police officer. In the opening scene, we see Rabbit roundly abusing a suspect: threatening him, planting evidence in his pocket, and finally slamming his head nose-first on to the desk. We then pull back to discover that Rabbit is actually demonstrating what policemen do all day for a classroom full of schoolchildren, using their teacher as a stand-in. \u201cNow,\u201d he says. \u201cWho wants to see how we fish opium out of sailors\u2019 arseholes?\u201d Little hands shoot up. Shortly after this moment, my predisposed goodwill towards Year of the Rabbit began to ebb. Beneath its vulgar, frenetic energy, something seemed to be misfiring. There were a few genuinely funny moments \u2013 the Elephant Man appearing as an informant, for one \u2013 but there were more gags that I simply watched tumbleweed by. Year of the Rabbit is too arch to seat itself in the period, but neither is it a full-on parody of costume drama. It veers jarringly from silly to gruesome and back \u2013 childish gags, adult violence. This could be a nod to the comparative savagery of the era, but there is a callousness at work that feels very modern. The character of Rabbit is a little hard to invest in: junkyard-dog mean, cartoonishly dissolute, coarser than wholegrain mustard. It is not even clear whether he is good at his job, or hopelessly incompetent. He is insufficiently deluded \u2013 unlike Berry\u2019s more masterly comic creation, Toast \u2013 to hold your sympathy from one scene to the next. And his swearing is so non-stop as to be ultimately desensitising. The plot, although complex, is often treated as a cursory formality. In this episode it involved the body of a dead woman and an MP, and it was solved to the general satisfaction of all concerned. \u201cI\u2019m getting out my loose-ends book,\u201d said the chief inspector. \u201cI\u2019m writing \u2018Tied up\u2019\u201d. That line says a lot about a show that, at times, seems to revel in its own slapdashery. To be fair, there is a lot of fun to be had just watching Berry maraud through it all. His gift for foul language, though sorely overrelied upon here, is nevertheless immense. His way with rhyming slang is almost as prodigious. Strangely, with a face as comically elastic as his, I sort of missed that chewed-off eyebrow. The remaining one was left working overtime. Funny is a hard thing to pronounce upon \u2013 some viewers will no doubt find Year of the Rabbit spot on.

I have peered into the future, and I am happy to say that episode two is a bit better than episode one, and episode three better still.

      "bodyText": "Lastly, Suzanne Wrack\u2019s report is here. Bye! Roll up! Roll up! Essential World Cup reading: Kadeisha Buchanan\u2019s first-half header is sufficient to seal victory. It was an underwhelming Canada performance \u2013 but they have the three points they so badly craved. Deanne Rose was very lively off the bench, definitely a plus point for Kenneth Heiner-M\u00f8ller, their Danish coach. As for Cameroon, it could be a painful couple of weeks. That was a very stodgy performance, and that is being kind. They offered precious little, despite staying in the game for so long. 90 min: There will be two added minutes. 88 min: And now a goalmouth scramble ensues! Cameroon \u2013 somehow \u2013 manage to hack the ball away, with Canada desperately trying to force it goalwards. Heroic defending \u2013 and great play again by the substitute Rose. She is surely a shoo-in to start their next Group E match, against New Zealand on Saturday. 87 min: Christine Sinclair thumps the ball just wide! That was a cracking volley. She hit it sweetly \u2013 but it zooms past Ndom\u2019s post. Cameroon survive. 86 min: Fleming plays in Beckie, who has a pop from 30 yards. It seems a decent effort but on closer inspection, it was rather wayward. She took a touch with her left foot to steady herself and then took aim with her right. It was always moving away from goal, though. But back come Canada ... 83 min: Labbe gifts the ball to Enganamouit \u2013 but Cameroon hand it straight back to Lawrence. It is on a plate for the Canada winger. Meanwhile Yango has been withdrawn for Cameroon. 81 min: Saying that, apparently Canada are the fifth-best team in the world. They have flattered to deceive for much of this. Deanne Rose has made a splash since coming on and Nichelle Prince was lively, dangerous in fits and starts. Christine Sinclair has been fairly quiet. Canada have simply not been good enough going forward, despite hogging the ball more-or-less all evening. 79 min: Time is ticking for Cameroon. And Canada win another plucky foul on halfway. That eats into the African side\u2019s chances of finding a leveller. Cameroon have been totally ineffectual in the final third. Really, really poor. 77 min: Canada go close! Rose does brilliantly, pulling the ball back for Sinclair \u2013 but the veteran striker cannot divert it goalwards. It was a cracking cross by the substitute, who has made a real impression since coming on, and Sinclair did well to bend her run to get something on it. But it bounces just wide. 76 min: Rose\u2019s first touch is positive, as Canada raid down the right. They need a second goal to ease any late tension. Cameroon, as poor as they have been, still sense an opportunity to snatch a late equaliser. Canada have gone very flat. 74 min: Kenneth Heiner-M\u00f8ller, the Danish Canada coach, has seen enough. Deanne Rose replaces Nichelle Prince, the Houston Dash winger who has certainly been one of their better performers. It has been a fairly underwhelming performance \u2013 even if they have dominated large spells. 72 min: A crude challenge by Leuko, the Strasbourg defender, on Beckie earns Canada a free-kick 35 yards out \u2013 and a little respite, in truth. But they fail to make anything of it. Adding a second would avoid a nervous finish. 70 min: Claudine Meffometou nods just wide! Cameroon get a rare corner \u2013 their third of this game \u2013 and Meffometou drops a downward header agonisingly past Labbe\u2019s post. That was comfortably Cameroon\u2019s best chance, best opening. It was a decent delivery, Meffometou ghosted towards the back post relatively unmarked but could not get her effort on target. A big let-off for Canada, who have drifted off to sleep in the last 15-20 minutes. Cameroon\u2019s subs have lifted their spirits. 69 min: Labbe lobs the ball out of play. This game has died of death in the last few minutes. Canada have been so untroubled, they appear to be struggling to motivate themselves. It is Cameroon, if anything, that are probing now ... 67 min: Another change for Cameroon: Enganamouit replaces Ndoumbouk. A like-for-like change. Cameroon have offered nothing going forward. 65 min: A change for Cameroon: Akaba replaces Nchout. 64 min: Canada are cruising. They have not been troubled by Cameroon. At all. It is getting increasingly difficult to see Cameroon equalising. 62 min: Prince gets away from Manie \u2013 but slices the cross! It all looked so promising for Canada. Some lovely footwork had left Manie dazed. 60 min: Onguene\u2019s getting a lecture from the North Korean referee. Cameroon will be relatively happy with this, though. They\u2019re still very much in it \u2013 even if they have offered precious little. Canada are frustrated by that five-strong defence and have made few clear in-roads. Cameroon, however, have made none. 58 min: Prince drags wide! A big chance goes begging for Canada. Beckie sends in a Canada corner in from the right, Cameroon do well to clear. They think that\u2019s the end of that but Canada have other ideas, recycling the ball out on halfway. They dink a pass into Nichelle Prince \u2013 but she skews her effort wide. Replays show the winger was in fact offside, so any goal may not have counted. But, we will never know. 56 min: Buchanan, the goalscorer, is a little overzealous in the challenge and Cameroon have a chance to whip it in from the left. The ball drops on the penalty spot \u2013 but Christine Sinclair, helping out in defence, powers clear. Cameroon get a corner out of it but Canada welly it away through Scott. 54 min: Cameroon lump a deep free-kick straight at Labbe, the Canada goalkeeper, who gratefully cradles the ball. She will pump it back downfield. 52 min: Lawrence twists and turns her way into the Cameroon box \u2013 the Canada winger does well, bamboozling the opposition defence. Bums are momentarily off seats \u2013 but the winger is eventually halted in her tracks. Prince and Lawrence have provided plenty of energy for Canada from wide areas. 51 min: Ah. It is straight into the wall by Sinclair. 49 min: Canada try to up the ante but Cameroon crowd out Fleming. But not cleanly, according to the Korean referee. And Canada have a golden opportunity to take aim at goal. Yango was penalised but Fleming appeared to simply trip. Anyway, it is Christine Sinclair and Sophie Schmidt who fancy it ... 47 min: Cameroon almost wriggle the ball away from Scott on halfway but they fail to break. Canada pick it back up and this games resumes order. 46 min: The second half is go. Cameroon kick-off. Some bits and pieces to get stuck into at half-time: Kadeisha Buchanan\u2019s downward header is the difference at the break. This is not a classic \u2013 far from it \u2013 but it is all to play for. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. Kadeisha Buchanan, the Lyon defender, arrives late at the back post and crashes in a header from a corner. Buchanan nodded into the ground and it cannoned into the net. Ndom, the Cameroon goalkeeper, had absolutely no chance. 42 min: Nichelle Prince\u2019s effort is deflected on to a post by Yvonne Leuko! Chapman did superbly, even if she did slightly overcook her pass, sliding the ball across goal for Michelle Prince. And the Canada winger came within inches of an 11th international goal. Prince struck at goal from an acute angle and Leuko, who plays for French club Arras, and Annette Ndom, the goalkeeper, threw themselves at it to keep it out, and the former\u2019s intervention proved sufficient. Cameroon survive, but back come Canada ... 41 min: Prince bends a decent ball into Beckie \u2013 but Cameroon nod the ball clear. Without looking too composed, they have stood firm when called on. They are not going to roll over anytime soon, that\u2019s for sure. Canada are going to have to dig deep if they are to garner victory here. 40 min: \u201cSimply for the sake of narrative, I hope Beckie takes free kicks for Canada,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cBend it like Beckie.\u201d We can hope! 38 min: Well, well, well! A few hundred supporters run ducking for cover, as the rain lashes down on fans seated in an uncovered stand at La Mosson, home of Ligue 1 side Montpellier. They are scurrying for cover. Back to the football, and Canada continue to dominate the ball, with Ndom punching clear from Chapman. 36 min: Ndoumbouk, the Cameroon forward, frowns after going into the book. And then has a brief sulk. She clattered the Canada midfielder Scott on halfway. 35 min: Zadorsky is penalised for handball \u2013 it is a little harsh \u2013 but Cameroon will take it. It is a golden opportunity to ping the ball towards the box but Canada survive without truly breaking sweat. Oguene forces the Canada defender into an error but then loses her footing, and it is back to square one. 33 min: Christine Sinclair is looking pretty isolated up front for Canada. For a player with such an impeccable scoring record, that is not good. They need to get her involved more often. Beckie has been lively, however. 32 min: Cameroon attempt to build, releasing Oguene down the right but Canada are oh so quick to snuff it out. Canada look strong and organised in defence \u2013 and pretty nifty going forward. But they are yet to really turn on the style. 29 min: Cameroon earn a corner, the crowd lap it up, they sense blood \u2013 possibly even a goal \u2013 but when the ball eventually comes in from the right, it is painfully poor. And Canada comfortably seize back possession. Breaking down a five-strong Cameroon defence is their biggest challenge. 26 min: Cameroon leather the ball downfield from a goal-kick but Schmidt gleefully collects on halfway. An athletic Canada side are patiently knocking the ball around nicely but that killer final pass continues to elude them. Cameroon are working their socks off with little \u2013 if anything \u2013 to show for it. 25 min: A Canada corner lands kindly at the feet of Buchanan \u2013 but she cannot divert the ball goalwards. But they do manage to recycle the ball, with good work by Janine Beckie down the right, who springs the offside trap. But Prince ends up skewing the ball wide of Ndom\u2019s goal. Canada are seeing plenty of the ball but are yet to conjure up a meaningful chance against a Cameroon side powerless to do much else but soak up wave after wave of pressure. 24 min: \u201cAs an expat now living in Toronto I am hoping this will be a day of a double triumph for Canada,\u201d emails Claire McConnell. \u201cFirst, a win for the women\u2019s soccer team and then the mighty Raptors taking the NBA championship away from the US for the first time in history. We The North!!\u201d 22 min: A little lull in play as Sophie Schmidt takes a knock. The Canada midfielder is fit to carry on, though. 19 min: Canada fly forward down the left but they force the final pass \u2013 and Cameroon gobble the ball back up inside the 18-yard box. 16 min: Cameroon feel aggrieved with Hyang-Ok Ri, the Korean referee. They get a little fortunate and break two-on-two, but Ndoumbouk appears to be hauled down, only for the referee to award Canada a free-kick. It all started up the other end, after Ndom gathered another high ball into the box. 15 min: And now Ndom makes a smart save from Schmidt! Canada are knocking at the door. But now all I can think of is the postcode lottery ... 14 min: Clever play by Beckie on the edge of the area, collecting a one-two from Fleming, but the move breaks down. Cameroon are struggling to get out of their own half. 12 min: Canada parachute the ball into the box, and they help it on towards Sinclair, who is lurking at the back post. It looks promising but Meffometuo acrobatically clears. The move culminates with Beckie driving wide of goal from 20 yards. That was more like it from Canada. They are grinding through the gears. 10 min: Cameroon probe for an opening but Lawrence, the Canada defender, is alert to it and comes bundling out from the back with possession. Canada, who are ranked fifth in the world, are yet to get fully into the groove. 8 min: Yango is late on Chapman and the Korean referee has a stern word with the Cameroon defender. Another opportunity for Canada to swing in a free-kick from a dangerous position, 30 yards out. Beckie, who plays her club football for Manchester City, has a pop but it is lacking in conviction. 7 min: \u201cLooking forward to a good game,\u201d emails Kimberly Tomasson. And we have one here. Things are beginning to spice up in Montpellier. 6 min: At the end of that Cameroon attacking phase, Schmidt slipped and clattered Onguene, the forward, on the follow through. The referee allows the player to receive treatment but waves play on, despite some clamour for VAR to intervene. 5 min: Good movement by Manie at the corner \u2013 but she stabs just wide of goal. Cameroon\u2019s tails are up after being made to sit and suffer early on. 4 min: And now Cameroon attempt to apply some heat, penning Canada in to win a corner. \u201cWhat a story Christine Sinclair is,\u201d emails Alex from Enfield. \u201c35 years old and still as prolific in front of goal as ever. Men\u2019s football \u2013 take note!\u201d 2 min: Christine Sinclair heads just wide! Canada maintain the pressure, winning a free-kick from the right flank and the striker rises highest to nod at goal and it is deflected wide. But Cameroon manage to ride out the early storm, hacking away a corner. 1 min: Canada win an early corner, there is bit of argy-bargy between Fleming and Yango, but Cameroon clear. Good start by the Canadians, though. Canada get the ball rolling in Montpellier. Canada and Cameroon trot out to the sound of Seven Nation Army, and we are just the national anthems away from kick-off. The teams are in the tunnel. Here we go ... ! Any pre-match thoughts, prediction or things to get off your chest? \u201cI\u2019m watching it in Ottawa,\u201d emails Ivan. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon see if Canada\u2019s younger players can step up or if it will be up to Sinclair to do all the scoring. As much as I hate to say it, I think they\u2019ll have a tough time against Cameroon today ...\u201d Now, then. This is Cameroon\u2019s second appearance at a World Cup having reached the last 16 when making their debut in 2015 (losing 1-0 to China PR). And here is some further pre-match trivia: the defender Estelle Johnson is set to make her international debut for Cameroon in France despite having an American father and a Malian mother. The Sky Blue FC centre-back was born in Maroua, a city in the north of Cameroon, and pledged her allegiance to the country having been inspired by the team\u2019s efforts at the 2015 World Cup. \u201cAs a team we want to perform better than we did in 2015 and we know we can achieve something interesting at the World Cup. I always wanted to play for Cameroon.\u201d Essential pre-match reading: Canada (4-4-2): Labbe; Lawrence, Buchanan, Zadorsky, Chapman; Prince, Scott, Schmidt, Beckie; Sinclair, Fleming Subs: Quinn, Ross, Grosso, Riviere, Huitema, Carle, Sheridan, Leon, Woeller, D\u2019Angelo, Agnew, Hellstrom Cameroon (4-5-1): Ndom; Leuko, Awona, Manie, Johnson, Meffometou; Ajara, Feudjio, Tango, Onguene; Ndoumbouk Subs: Ejangu, Ngono Mani, Meyong Menene, Abena, Sonkeng, Mambinga, Enganamouit, Akaba, Mbeleck, Takounda Engolo, Abam, Ongmahan Referee: Hyang-Ok Ri (Korea) Welcome to Group E.

      "body": "<p>In a performance typical of Canada of late - dull but efficient - another of Lyon\u2019s treble-winners, the centre-back Kadeisha Buchanan, proved the difference as they made it nine in 10 clean sheets in 2019 against slightly chaotic but exhilarating Cameroon.</p> <p>One would be forgiven for handing home advantage to the French national team at a World Cup in France but in a cool Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier, with the sun setting, Cameroon were urged on with more gusto than that on show in the Parc des Princes last Friday, with significantly fewer numbers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/10/womens-world-cup-argentina-japan-match-report\">Japan held to goalless draw by Argentina at Women\u2019s World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>PSG\u2019s stadium rocked but, as the Cameroonian national anthem began to play, the allegiance of the crowd was clear. It moved, danced, jumped, sang, clapped and swayed in unison for the Indomitable Lionesses. This was a migrant community welcoming their team, which includes nine players who play their club football in France, sort of home.</p> <p>It is rare Cameroon venture beyond their borders, unlike the two other teams from Africa competing at this World Cup, their preparations against international teams has been limited to a 1-0 loss to China in April and a 4-0 defeat by Spain in May.</p> <p>Meanwhile South Africa and Nigeria both competed at in the friendly Cyprus Cup. There is a reason this team came third behind those two at the African Cup of Nations, they lack cohesion on the pitch.</p> <p>The Canadians dominated possession but struggled to carve out clear-cut chances. Two corners and a free-kick inside four minutes gave the early impression that this would be a whitewash but as the clock ticked on, the women in green grew in confidence and Canada\u2019s talisman, Christine Sinclair, only four shy of Abby Wambach\u2019s record haul of 184 international goals, looked more and more isolated.</p> <p>With the scary pace of Gabrielle Aboudi Onguene on the right wing linking well with Ajara Nchout, who plays for the Norwegian side Valerenga, and the forward Marlyse Ngo Ndoumbouk, there were signs that a Canadian defence that has conceded only once in 2019 could be breached by the team ranked 46th in the world.</p> <p>Except that Canada also have someone playing at home. The 23-year-old Buchanan is the defender beginning to muscle apart Wendie Renard and Mbock Bathy\u2019s Lyon centre-back partnership. With Aboudi Onguene bearing down on Stephanie Labbe in goal, Buchanan raced back to whip the ball from the feet of the dynamic winger where many would have conceded a penalty.</p> <p>With Canada slightly rattled it was Buchanan again who settled the nerves, a downward header past Annette Ngo Ndom giving the \u2018visitors\u2019 the lead moments before half-time.</p> <p>England\u2019s Lucy Bronze said in April that \u201cat the World Cup the girls at Lyon are probably the ones that are going to change the games\u201d. With a France team built around a core of Lyon\u2019s superstars inflicting a 4-0 defeat on South Korea, Buchanan handing Canada three points in a testing environment and Bronze and Nikita Parris providing England\u2019s best outlet in their win over Scotland, it is hard to disagree.</p> <p>\u201cThe environment that we\u2019re training in is very high,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cLyon is one of the best club teams so to have that many top players playing for them, every practice is difficult. It is all about the environment we are in before the World Cup.\u201d</p> <p>What is also clear is that Canada\u2019s progress may have edged closer but it is by no means assured. This is a tough group. Netherlands, the Euro 2017 winners, boast the best forward line in the competition while New Zealand pulled off a surprise win against England in Brighton.</p> <p>When defences isolate Sinclair they struggle to create. There were some hairy moments for the five sitting deep for Cameroon, with the former NWSL player Estelle Johnson and team captain Christine Manie at its heart, but they looked a far more organised side than they did at their maiden World Cup in 2015 where they lost to China in the last 16.</p> <p>They drove until the end but the Canadian defence held typically firm. \u201cWe take out defence very seriously,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cThe back line has been working together for a number of years now. All of us have quite a lot of caps playing with each other, so there\u2019s a lot of connections there.\u201d</p> <p>A reliance on that defence both to hold the dam and score the goals will take them only so far on this stage, though. With the Netherlands Canada\u2019s final group opponents on 20 June, that back line will be really tested against the best and it may become clear whether their run to a quarter-final on home soil in 2015 was just a team surfing on home momentum.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/10/nikita-parris-outstanding-england-assured-start\">Nikita Parris the outstanding performer in England\u2019s assured start | Eni Aluko</a> </p> </aside>",

      "bodyText": "In a performance typical of Canada of late - dull but efficient - another of Lyon\u2019s treble-winners, the centre-back Kadeisha Buchanan, proved the difference as they made it nine in 10 clean sheets in 2019 against slightly chaotic but exhilarating Cameroon. One would be forgiven for handing home advantage to the French national team at a World Cup in France but in a cool Stade de la Mosson in Montpellier, with the sun setting, Cameroon were urged on with more gusto than that on show in the Parc des Princes last Friday, with significantly fewer numbers. PSG\u2019s stadium rocked but, as the Cameroonian national anthem began to play, the allegiance of the crowd was clear. It moved, danced, jumped, sang, clapped and swayed in unison for the Indomitable Lionesses. This was a migrant community welcoming their team, which includes nine players who play their club football in France, sort of home. It is rare Cameroon venture beyond their borders, unlike the two other teams from Africa competing at this World Cup, their preparations against international teams has been limited to a 1-0 loss to China in April and a 4-0 defeat by Spain in May. Meanwhile South Africa and Nigeria both competed at in the friendly Cyprus Cup. There is a reason this team came third behind those two at the African Cup of Nations, they lack cohesion on the pitch. The Canadians dominated possession but struggled to carve out clear-cut chances. Two corners and a free-kick inside four minutes gave the early impression that this would be a whitewash but as the clock ticked on, the women in green grew in confidence and Canada\u2019s talisman, Christine Sinclair, only four shy of Abby Wambach\u2019s record haul of 184 international goals, looked more and more isolated. With the scary pace of Gabrielle Aboudi Onguene on the right wing linking well with Ajara Nchout, who plays for the Norwegian side Valerenga, and the forward Marlyse Ngo Ndoumbouk, there were signs that a Canadian defence that has conceded only once in 2019 could be breached by the team ranked 46th in the world. Except that Canada also have someone playing at home. The 23-year-old Buchanan is the defender beginning to muscle apart Wendie Renard and Mbock Bathy\u2019s Lyon centre-back partnership. With Aboudi Onguene bearing down on Stephanie Labbe in goal, Buchanan raced back to whip the ball from the feet of the dynamic winger where many would have conceded a penalty. With Canada slightly rattled it was Buchanan again who settled the nerves, a downward header past Annette Ngo Ndom giving the \u2018visitors\u2019 the lead moments before half-time. England\u2019s Lucy Bronze said in April that \u201cat the World Cup the girls at Lyon are probably the ones that are going to change the games\u201d. With a France team built around a core of Lyon\u2019s superstars inflicting a 4-0 defeat on South Korea, Buchanan handing Canada three points in a testing environment and Bronze and Nikita Parris providing England\u2019s best outlet in their win over Scotland, it is hard to disagree. \u201cThe environment that we\u2019re training in is very high,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cLyon is one of the best club teams so to have that many top players playing for them, every practice is difficult. It is all about the environment we are in before the World Cup.\u201d What is also clear is that Canada\u2019s progress may have edged closer but it is by no means assured. This is a tough group. Netherlands, the Euro 2017 winners, boast the best forward line in the competition while New Zealand pulled off a surprise win against England in Brighton. When defences isolate Sinclair they struggle to create. There were some hairy moments for the five sitting deep for Cameroon, with the former NWSL player Estelle Johnson and team captain Christine Manie at its heart, but they looked a far more organised side than they did at their maiden World Cup in 2015 where they lost to China in the last 16. They drove until the end but the Canadian defence held typically firm. \u201cWe take out defence very seriously,\u201d said Buchanan. \u201cThe back line has been working together for a number of years now. All of us have quite a lot of caps playing with each other, so there\u2019s a lot of connections there.\u201d A reliance on that defence both to hold the dam and score the goals will take them only so far on this stage, though. With the Netherlands Canada\u2019s final group opponents on 20 June, that back line will be really tested against the best and it may become clear whether their run to a quarter-final on home soil in 2015 was just a team surfing on home momentum.",

There is \u201ca specific form of poisonous leftwing antisemitism that highlights global conspiratorial capitalist cabals and class enemies\u201d.

Insys\u2019s founder, John Kapoor, and four former executives are facing lengthy prison sentences after they were convicted last month of bribing doctors to prescribe the company\u2019s opioid spray, Subsys, to patients who did not need it. Subsys is made of fentanyl, an opioid many times stronger than morphine, and was approved for terminal cancer patients. But the company targeted sales at the much larger and more profitable market of people with non-life-threatening chronic pain. Kapoor oversaw a marketing strategy in which payments to doctors, ostensibly for speeches at educational seminars, were effectively bribes to prescribe the drug. Prosecutors said the seminars were no more than social gatherings at restaurants, bars and strip clubs. In one instance, the company paid nearly $260,000 to two New York doctors who wrote more than $6m worth of Subsys prescriptions in 2014. Sales of Subsys surged into the hundreds of millions of dollars a year as a result of the company\u2019s aggressive marketing. The US attorney in Boston who prosecuted Insys, Andrew Lelling, accused the company of \u201cillegal conduct that prioritised its profits over the health of thousands of patients\u201d and of \u201cfuelling the opioid epidemic\u201d. Before the agreement with the justice department, Insys was facing large legal bills as it fought hundreds of lawsuits alongside other companies accused of fuelling an epidemic that has claimed more than 400,000 lives over the past two decades. They include Purdue Pharma, the maker of the powerful opioid, OxyContin, which kickstarted the crisis. The multinational drug giant, Johnson &amp; Johnson, is in the midst of a civil trial in Oklahoma where it has been accused of \u201ca cynical, deceitful multimillion-dollar brainwashing campaign\u201d to drive up sales of its powerful painkillers. Oklahoma\u2019s attorney general, Mike Hunter, said greed led the company to play a leading role in \u201cthe worst manmade health crisis in the history of the country and the state\u201d. Oklahoma is seeking billions of dollars in compensation to help cover the long-term consequences of the opioid epidemic in the state. A statement by the lead counsels in the combined legal cases of more than 1,800 states, cities and other communities seeking billions of dollars in compensation from 22 opioid manufacturers, distributors and pharmacies, said they would continue to pursue the legal action against Insys to recover the costs of the epidemic on public finances, from increased crime to addiction treatment and care for orphaned children. \u201cBankruptcy and restructuring does not necessarily mean that a company is insolvent. Additionally, the goal of the litigation is not to bankrupt these opioid companies, but to abate the current opioid epidemic and seek long-term, sustainable solutions. If any defendant files for bankruptcy, we will work through all legal avenues to see that our clients\u2019 end goal of abating the crisis is met,\u201d they said. \u201cThe American public deserves to see the truth behind this epidemic revealed and justice served.\u201d",

The video sparked a critical front-page news story in the West Australian. On Monday night Briggs dismissed the backlash, saying he tried to push himself out of his comfort zone because \u201cchange doesn\u2019t come from being comfortable\u201d. \u201cI always get the kickback,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of, that\u2019s just showbiz, baby.\u201d The Victorian musician said he wanted to provide a \u201cscoreboard\u201d to Australia that showed the disadvantages faced by First Nations people. The video was prompted by the news a group of Indigenous rugby league players would not sing the anthem at last week\u2019s State of Origin match. The rapper \u2013 whose best-known songs includes January 26, which advocates changing the date of Australia Day \u2013 told the Q&amp;A audience most young Australians were taught to sing the anthem at school and didn\u2019t \u201cask questions \u2026 because everyone else is [singing it]\u201d. \u201cSo I don\u2019t think a lot of people are that attached to the actual anthem.

In a special episode to mark Sydney\u2019s Vivid festival, he was joined on the panel by the actor and writer Faustina Agolley, the billionaire founder of Atlassian Mike Cannon-Brookes, the CSIRO chief executive, Larry Marshall, and the cyberpsychologist Jocelyn Brewer. Cannon-Brookes said he had changed his mind about the anthem after watching Briggs\u2019s video. \u201cHe\u2019s totally right,\u201d he said. \u201cThis made a lot of sense.

A Labour source called the meeting \u201crobust\u201d, but said it had not been worse than previous meetings.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country \u2013 and among Labour MPs. That\u2019s no secret at all,\u201d the source said.</p> <p>\u201cWe are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs \u2026 The PLP is very passionate, and that\u2019s what we would expect.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn\u2019s comments about ending the criticism of staff were taken to refer to Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who was criticised in leaked emails for her apparent handling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/02/labour-mps-overhaul-complaints-procedure-david-prescott-allegations\">of two harassment complaints</a>, one against senior Labour aide David Prescott and another against Pete Willsman, a member of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee who has since been suspended over allegations of antisemitism.</p> <p>Jess Phillips, the chair of the Women\u2019s PLP, told the meeting the revelations were shameful. \u201cIf you abuse women in the Labour party and they\u2019re a friend of yours, they get away with it,\u201d she said, according to MPs in the room. Corbyn robustly denied that was the case, saying she should not have suggested that.</p> <p>MPs also expressed alarm that Corbyn\u2019s opening speech failed to mention the investigation into antisemitism in the party that has been launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p> <p>The party\u2019s handling of antisemitism cases was compared with the automatic expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections. Labour MP Wes Streeting suggested this was a double standard.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes, apologised to MPs at the meeting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/jeremy-corbyn-new-peterborough-labour-mp-lisa-forbes-not-a-racist-in-any-way\">for liking Facebook posts that referred to \u201cZionist slavemasters\u201d</a>. But MPs including Margaret Hodge said Forbes had failed to address another aspect of the complaints, her signing of a letter criticising the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism.</p> <p>Forbes said she had written to Jewish community groups and hoped to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs tore into Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Brexit strategy at a party meeting on Monday night, with several MPs loyal to the leadership saying they felt ashamed to vote for the party at the European elections and urging a change of direction. MPs inside the private gathering said there were surprise interventions from colleagues who had never before spoken out against Corbyn, including Lloyd Russell-Moyle and Marie Rimmer. The parliamentary Labour party (PLP) meeting came amid anger about how Corbyn\u2019s office had handled harassment complaints against two senior Labour figures, as well as an investigation into Labour antisemitism by the equalities watchdog. One MP leaving the committee room said it had been Corbyn\u2019s \u201cworst meeting in his time as leader\u201d \u2013 including those that led to the vote of no confidence in him. \u201cHe did not even seem to acknowledge there were difficulties, from Brexit, to sexual harassment, to antisemitism.\u201d Speaking to MPs for the first time since the European election results, where Labour was beaten into third place by the Liberal Democrats, Corbyn reiterated that the party would back a referendum on any deal passed by parliament and said the issue would be discussed by the shadow cabinet on Tuesday, but the assurances did little to stem the criticism.

A Labour source called the meeting \u201crobust\u201d, but said it had not been worse than previous meetings. \u201cClearly, there are very strong feelings about Brexit and how it should be handled, both in the Labour party and the country \u2013 and among Labour MPs. That\u2019s no secret at all,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe are in a period of heightened polarisation on Brexit, and that is why Jeremy is trying to find a way that reflects our conference policy and that brings the country together. We are listening to the views of members and our MPs \u2026 The PLP is very passionate, and that\u2019s what we would expect.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s comments about ending the criticism of staff were taken to refer to Karie Murphy, his chief of staff, who was criticised in leaked emails for her apparent handling of two harassment complaints, one against senior Labour aide David Prescott and another against Pete Willsman, a member of Labour\u2019s ruling national executive committee who has since been suspended over allegations of antisemitism. Jess Phillips, the chair of the Women\u2019s PLP, told the meeting the revelations were shameful. \u201cIf you abuse women in the Labour party and they\u2019re a friend of yours, they get away with it,\u201d she said, according to MPs in the room. Corbyn robustly denied that was the case, saying she should not have suggested that. MPs also expressed alarm that Corbyn\u2019s opening speech failed to mention the investigation into antisemitism in the party that has been launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The party\u2019s handling of antisemitism cases was compared with the automatic expulsion of the former spin doctor Alastair Campbell for admitting he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections. Labour MP Wes Streeting suggested this was a double standard. Labour\u2019s new Peterborough MP, Lisa Forbes, apologised to MPs at the meeting for liking Facebook posts that referred to \u201cZionist slavemasters\u201d. But MPs including Margaret Hodge said Forbes had failed to address another aspect of the complaints, her signing of a letter criticising the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of antisemitism. Forbes said she had written to Jewish community groups and hoped to meet the Board of Deputies and the Jewish Labour Movement.",

      "body": "<p>There is a simple riposte to anyone who doubts an Olympics can truly transform a city: Tokyo. When Japan\u2019s capital first won the right to host the Games, in 1959, it suffered from a desperate shortage of housing and functional infrastructure \u2013 and the lack of flush toilets meant most waste had to be vacuumed daily out of cesspits underneath buildings by \u201choney wagon\u201d trucks. But within five years Japan\u2019s capital had undergone such a metamorphosis that visitors to the 1964 Olympics responded with stunned awe.</p> \n<p>\u201cOut of the jungle of concrete mixers, mud and timber that has been Tokyo for years, the city has emerged, as from a chrysalis, to stand glitteringly ready for the Olympics,\u201d the Times\u2019 correspondent swooned, citing a long list of buildings and accomplishments \u201call blurring into a neon haze \u2026 that will convince the new arrival he has come upon a mirage\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c7803d7b-e36f-4032-9b2a-86a2035cf3e5\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>As Japan's capital enters a year in the spotlight, from the Rugby World up to the 2020 Olympics, Guardian Cities is spending a week reporting live from the largest megacity on Earth. Despite being the world's riskiest place \u2013 with 37 million people vulnerable to tsunami, flooding and due a potentially catastrophic earthquake \u2013 it is also one of the most resilient, both in its hi-tech design and its pragmatic social structure. Using manga, photography, film and a group of salarimen rappers, we'll hear from the locals how they feel about their famously impenetrable city finally embracing its global crown</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>But Tokyo\u2019s makeover was real. There were 100km of freshly laid highways, a new sewage system, new luxury hotels and 21km of monorail from the new international airport to downtown. Meanwhile, the new Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train blasted to Kyoto and back at world-record speed, and startlingly modernist arenas such as the Tokyo metropolitan gymnasium, which was shaped like a flying saucer, only added to the futuristic wonderland vibe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb7e08376a66380ff61caecb260720b12e80ee14\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb7e08376a66380ff61caecb260720b12e80ee14/0_101_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New freeways are rush-built in 1963 in Tokyo ahead of the following year\u2019s Olympics.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New freeways are rush-built in 1963 in Tokyo ahead of the following year\u2019s Olympics.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There were also technological innovations. Computers were used for the first time at an Olympics, along with timing devices that could separate competitors to one-hundredth of a second. And the Syncom III satellite, combined with cutting-edge Japanese technology, enabled live TV pictures to be beamed across the globe \u2013 another first. No wonder it was hailed as the \u201cscience fiction\u201d Olympics.</p> \n<p>Tokyo 1964 was, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/david-goldblatt\">David Goldblatt</a> in his excellent book The Games, \u201cthe single greatest act of collective reimagining in Japan\u2019s postwar history\u201d. And there was a clear message for the wider world too, reflected in the choice of Yoshinori Sakai, born in Hiroshima on the day the atomic bomb was dropped on the city, to light the Olympic flame. The 19-year-old athlete was not only a symbol of his country\u2019s rebirth following the second world war \u2013 but also its hope for a brighter future.</p> \n<p>Such was the event\u2019s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020. Every Olympian knows, after all, that while winning a gold medal is a formidable task, repeating the trick years later is tougher still. On the 24th floor of the Harumi Triton Y building, organisers finalising plans for next year\u2019s Olympics and Paralympics say the world will see the \u201cmost innovative\u201d Games in history.</p> \n<p>Not everyone, to put it mildly, is as upbeat.</p> \n<h2>\u2018At that point blood drained out of his face\u2019</h2> \n<p>Shortly after Japan won the right to host the 2020 Games, the country\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, toured the Queen Elizabeth Park in Stratford, London, with Sebastian Coe, who had steered the hugely successful 2012 Olympics. There was only one thing on Abe\u2019s mind: money.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe only question he kept asking was: \u2018How much was that? How much was that?\u2019\u201d Lord Coe recalls. \u201cHe loved the velodrome, which he thought was a beautiful building architecturally. I also explained the difficulties we had with the Olympic Stadium because we couldn\u2019t get football engaged and he said: \u2018Oh yeah, I get that.\u2019</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eef7dd0e050b9189b456eea7fb4c4bd10a552b1b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eef7dd0e050b9189b456eea7fb4c4bd10a552b1b/0_112_3840_2304/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kengo Kuma\u2019s under-construction New National Stadium, intended to \u2018restore the link that Tokyo lost with nature\u2019, in 2018.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kengo Kuma\u2019s under-construction New National Stadium, intended to \u2018restore the link that Tokyo lost with nature\u2019, in 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThen he pointed at the Aquatics Centre and said: \u2018And that one?\u2019 I told him that was the most expensive and that Zaha Hadid had designed it. At that point blood drained out of his face and he said: \u2018She\u2019s done our new Olympic stadium.\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>By 2015 Hadid\u2019s plans for the stadium, which had spiralled to \u00a31.3bn, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/dec/16/tokyo-olympic-stadium-new-proposals-after-zaha-hadid\">had been cancelled \u2013 and a new design</a> by Kengo Kuma, blending steel and layers of latticed larch wood and intended to \u201crestore the link that Tokyo lost with nature\u201d, chosen instead. But while it is hundreds of millions of pounds cheaper, the Olympics and Paralympics remain a money pit. Last year Japanese government auditors predicted the Games would cost around \u00a319.5bn \u2013 close to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9c15297a-d38d-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5\">four times</a> more than originally forecast in 2013.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/olympics-zip/giv-39026E9HATLsDr9x/\" data-alt=\"Olympic venues for Tokyo 2020\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2019/06/olympics-zip/giv-39026E9HATLsDr9x/\">Olympic venues for Tokyo 2020</a> \n</figure> \n<p>To make matters worse, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/japan-olympic-committee-president-tsunekazu-takeda-to-resign-corruption-allegations-scandal\">forced to step down</a> in March following corruption revelations about the bid, first revealed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/tokyo-olympics-payment-diack-2020-games\">the Guardian</a> in 2016. Tokyo might be about to throw the greatest sporting party of them all. But, some of its residents ask, at what cost?</p> \n<h2>\u2018It is important to showcase our robot technology\u2019</h2> \n<p>So what will Japan get for its investment next summer, aside from eight shiny new arenas?</p> \n<p>In their office in Tokyo\u2019s bay area, organisers stress that the Olympics and Paralympics will be \u201ca catalyst for social change\u201d \u2013 particularly by improving attitudes and facilities towards disabled people and opening up the country more. That makes sense. Japan remains the world\u2019s third largest economy, but that position is in jeopardy due to a growing shortage of workers and an ageing population.</p> \n<p>Another key aim for Tokyo 2020 is for it to be the \u201crecovery and reconstruction Games\u201d, following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/24/the-school-beneath-the-wave-the-unimaginable-tragedy-of-japans-tsunami\">Tohoku disaster in 2011</a>, when an earthquake and tsunami led to over 10,000 deaths and a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. \u201cBaseball and softball matches will be held in the disaster-affected areas,\u201d says Masa Takaya, spokesman for the Tokyo 2020 organisers, \u201cand restore vitality through the power of sport.\u201d</p> \n<p>But these Games will be more about hearts and minds than bricks and mortar. \u201cTokyo 2020 is focusing more on the softer legacy,\u201d says Takaya. \u201cOf course we have a similar spirit as 1964 by leaving new sporting facilities. But we are even more keen to leave an intangible legacy for future generations, who will have a first-hand experience of the Games with a massive number of people with different backgrounds, religions and languages coming together in one place.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some of the 1964 playbook will be dusted off, with Japan keen to show it still leads the world in tech. Toyota not only plans to showcase its driverless cars at the Games but has also designed robots for the new Olympic stadium that, among other things, can take \u2013 and then bring \u2013 food and drinks orders to spectators using wheelchairs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dcd653af6511ff7bb9f59ad38ef3caa8436e5db\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7dcd653af6511ff7bb9f59ad38ef3caa8436e5db/0_167_5000_2999/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man carries a suitcase using Panasonic\u2019s Power Assist Suit ahead of the 2020 Games.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man carries a suitcase using Panasonic\u2019s Power Assist Suit ahead of the 2020 Games.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Panasonic, meanwhile, has created motor-assisted power suits to allow people to carry heavy luggage with ease. And Aruze Gaming\u2019s Arisa \u2013 a sharply dressed six-foot robot that can show passengers the way to toilets and lockers, offer directions and recommend tourist attractions, in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean \u2013 was tested at two metro stations earlier this year.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are still discussing what sort of other robots can we use for the Games operations,\u201d says Takaya. \u201cIt is important to showcase our robot technology.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018Tourists might enjoy it \u2026 but for citizens it will be hellish\u2019</h2> \n<p>It certainly sounds appetising enough. But in a coffee shop near Yoyogi Park, Misako Ichimura and Kumiko Suto of the Hangorin no Kai (No Olympics 2020) activist group, paint a much bleaker picture of the Games\u2019 impact.</p> \n<p>Among their many concerns, they claim that the construction of the new national stadium, along with other \u201cupgrading\u201d projects, has led to homeless people in areas like Shibuya and Shinjuku being forcibly removed from parks and streets. They also express dismay that nearly 300 residents were evicted from 10 public housing projects near the stadium to make way for luxury buildings.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany of these people were elderly residents living alone, and around 10 passed away just before or soon after their cruel removal from their homes,\u201d says Ichimura. \u201cPublic housing is being destroyed in favour of high-end housing, but no new projects are going up to offset these displaced people. To make matters worse, the government has also pushed the homeless tent communities out of Meiji Park.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa712d149d36c8a8446f444e2310e3480dea7214\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa712d149d36c8a8446f444e2310e3480dea7214/0_175_5327_3196/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A homeless couple in Ueno Park, Tokyo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A homeless couple in Ueno Park, Tokyo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Look/Alamy Stock Photo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Activists also have concerns about health and safety at construction sites that were backed up by The Dark Side of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, a recent report by the global trade union federation Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International. It documents how low pay, overwork and poor access to grievance procedures have created a \u201cculture of fear\u201d among construction workers \u2013 and says some workers have been required to work up to 28 days in a row on Olympic projects.</p> \n<p>There are unwelcome echoes of the past here. Before Tokyo 1964, safety standards were so low that \u201cthat there were more than 100 deaths and 2,000 injuries on Olympic-related projects\u201d, according to Goldblatt, while the beggars and vagrants who made their homes in Ueno Park were also swept aside.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Ichimura says many residents are dreading next summer. \u201cSchools and other events are being cancelled or having altered schedules,\u201d she says, \u201cand the already difficult summertime transportation will be much more crowded and hot. Tourists might enjoy a happy and fun experience but for citizens it will be hellish.\u201d</p> \n<p>Not all criticism of the Games comes from leftwing social activists. Makoto Yokohari, a professor at the department of urban engineering at the University of Tokyo, says that while he agrees that the Games needs to promote soft legacies, he hasn\u2019t seen any sign of them yet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ae5d2f03e645184475572c66ac0b95a22fe55f6\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ae5d2f03e645184475572c66ac0b95a22fe55f6/0_340_5003_3001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunrise at the Yoyogi national gymnasium in 1964, designed by Kenzo Tange.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunrise at the Yoyogi national gymnasium in 1964, designed by Kenzo Tange.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Art Rickerby/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cThe Olympics may merely be a snapshot event which may become like an illusion within a couple of years,\u201d he says.

      "bodyText": "There is a simple riposte to anyone who doubts an Olympics can truly transform a city: Tokyo. When Japan\u2019s capital first won the right to host the Games, in 1959, it suffered from a desperate shortage of housing and functional infrastructure \u2013 and the lack of flush toilets meant most waste had to be vacuumed daily out of cesspits underneath buildings by \u201choney wagon\u201d trucks. But within five years Japan\u2019s capital had undergone such a metamorphosis that visitors to the 1964 Olympics responded with stunned awe. \u201cOut of the jungle of concrete mixers, mud and timber that has been Tokyo for years, the city has emerged, as from a chrysalis, to stand glitteringly ready for the Olympics,\u201d the Times\u2019 correspondent swooned, citing a long list of buildings and accomplishments \u201call blurring into a neon haze \u2026 that will convince the new arrival he has come upon a mirage\u201d. But Tokyo\u2019s makeover was real. There were 100km of freshly laid highways, a new sewage system, new luxury hotels and 21km of monorail from the new international airport to downtown. Meanwhile, the new Tokaido Shinkansen bullet train blasted to Kyoto and back at world-record speed, and startlingly modernist arenas such as the Tokyo metropolitan gymnasium, which was shaped like a flying saucer, only added to the futuristic wonderland vibe. There were also technological innovations. Computers were used for the first time at an Olympics, along with timing devices that could separate competitors to one-hundredth of a second. And the Syncom III satellite, combined with cutting-edge Japanese technology, enabled live TV pictures to be beamed across the globe \u2013 another first. No wonder it was hailed as the \u201cscience fiction\u201d Olympics. Tokyo 1964 was, according to David Goldblatt in his excellent book The Games, \u201cthe single greatest act of collective reimagining in Japan\u2019s postwar history\u201d. And there was a clear message for the wider world too, reflected in the choice of Yoshinori Sakai, born in Hiroshima on the day the atomic bomb was dropped on the city, to light the Olympic flame. The 19-year-old athlete was not only a symbol of his country\u2019s rebirth following the second world war \u2013 but also its hope for a brighter future. Such was the event\u2019s success that it has set the bar dazzlingly high for Tokyo 2020. Every Olympian knows, after all, that while winning a gold medal is a formidable task, repeating the trick years later is tougher still. On the 24th floor of the Harumi Triton Y building, organisers finalising plans for next year\u2019s Olympics and Paralympics say the world will see the \u201cmost innovative\u201d Games in history. Not everyone, to put it mildly, is as upbeat. \u2018At that point blood drained out of his face\u2019 Shortly after Japan won the right to host the 2020 Games, the country\u2019s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, toured the Queen Elizabeth Park in Stratford, London, with Sebastian Coe, who had steered the hugely successful 2012 Olympics. There was only one thing on Abe\u2019s mind: money. \u201cThe only question he kept asking was: \u2018How much was that? How much was that?\u2019\u201d Lord Coe recalls. \u201cHe loved the velodrome, which he thought was a beautiful building architecturally. I also explained the difficulties we had with the Olympic Stadium because we couldn\u2019t get football engaged and he said: \u2018Oh yeah, I get that.\u2019 \u201cThen he pointed at the Aquatics Centre and said: \u2018And that one?\u2019 I told him that was the most expensive and that Zaha Hadid had designed it. At that point blood drained out of his face and he said: \u2018She\u2019s done our new Olympic stadium.\u2019\u201d By 2015 Hadid\u2019s plans for the stadium, which had spiralled to \u00a31.3bn, had been cancelled \u2013 and a new design by Kengo Kuma, blending steel and layers of latticed larch wood and intended to \u201crestore the link that Tokyo lost with nature\u201d, chosen instead. But while it is hundreds of millions of pounds cheaper, the Olympics and Paralympics remain a money pit. Last year Japanese government auditors predicted the Games would cost around \u00a319.5bn \u2013 close to four times more than originally forecast in 2013. To make matters worse, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, Tsunekazu Takeda, was forced to step down in March following corruption revelations about the bid, first revealed by the Guardian in 2016. Tokyo might be about to throw the greatest sporting party of them all. But, some of its residents ask, at what cost? \u2018It is important to showcase our robot technology\u2019 So what will Japan get for its investment next summer, aside from eight shiny new arenas? In their office in Tokyo\u2019s bay area, organisers stress that the Olympics and Paralympics will be \u201ca catalyst for social change\u201d \u2013 particularly by improving attitudes and facilities towards disabled people and opening up the country more. That makes sense. Japan remains the world\u2019s third largest economy, but that position is in jeopardy due to a growing shortage of workers and an ageing population. Another key aim for Tokyo 2020 is for it to be the \u201crecovery and reconstruction Games\u201d, following the Tohoku disaster in 2011, when an earthquake and tsunami led to over 10,000 deaths and a meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear power plant. \u201cBaseball and softball matches will be held in the disaster-affected areas,\u201d says Masa Takaya, spokesman for the Tokyo 2020 organisers, \u201cand restore vitality through the power of sport.\u201d But these Games will be more about hearts and minds than bricks and mortar. \u201cTokyo 2020 is focusing more on the softer legacy,\u201d says Takaya. \u201cOf course we have a similar spirit as 1964 by leaving new sporting facilities. But we are even more keen to leave an intangible legacy for future generations, who will have a first-hand experience of the Games with a massive number of people with different backgrounds, religions and languages coming together in one place.\u201d Some of the 1964 playbook will be dusted off, with Japan keen to show it still leads the world in tech. Toyota not only plans to showcase its driverless cars at the Games but has also designed robots for the new Olympic stadium that, among other things, can take \u2013 and then bring \u2013 food and drinks orders to spectators using wheelchairs. Panasonic, meanwhile, has created motor-assisted power suits to allow people to carry heavy luggage with ease. And Aruze Gaming\u2019s Arisa \u2013 a sharply dressed six-foot robot that can show passengers the way to toilets and lockers, offer directions and recommend tourist attractions, in Japanese, English, Chinese and Korean \u2013 was tested at two metro stations earlier this year. \u201cWe are still discussing what sort of other robots can we use for the Games operations,\u201d says Takaya. \u201cIt is important to showcase our robot technology.\u201d \u2018Tourists might enjoy it \u2026 but for citizens it will be hellish\u2019 It certainly sounds appetising enough. But in a coffee shop near Yoyogi Park, Misako Ichimura and Kumiko Suto of the Hangorin no Kai (No Olympics 2020) activist group, paint a much bleaker picture of the Games\u2019 impact. Among their many concerns, they claim that the construction of the new national stadium, along with other \u201cupgrading\u201d projects, has led to homeless people in areas like Shibuya and Shinjuku being forcibly removed from parks and streets. They also express dismay that nearly 300 residents were evicted from 10 public housing projects near the stadium to make way for luxury buildings. \u201cMany of these people were elderly residents living alone, and around 10 passed away just before or soon after their cruel removal from their homes,\u201d says Ichimura. \u201cPublic housing is being destroyed in favour of high-end housing, but no new projects are going up to offset these displaced people. To make matters worse, the government has also pushed the homeless tent communities out of Meiji Park.\u201d Activists also have concerns about health and safety at construction sites that were backed up by The Dark Side of the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics, a recent report by the global trade union federation Building and Wood Workers\u2019 International. It documents how low pay, overwork and poor access to grievance procedures have created a \u201cculture of fear\u201d among construction workers \u2013 and says some workers have been required to work up to 28 days in a row on Olympic projects. There are unwelcome echoes of the past here. Before Tokyo 1964, safety standards were so low that \u201cthat there were more than 100 deaths and 2,000 injuries on Olympic-related projects\u201d, according to Goldblatt, while the beggars and vagrants who made their homes in Ueno Park were also swept aside. Meanwhile, Ichimura says many residents are dreading next summer. \u201cSchools and other events are being cancelled or having altered schedules,\u201d she says, \u201cand the already difficult summertime transportation will be much more crowded and hot. Tourists might enjoy a happy and fun experience but for citizens it will be hellish.\u201d Not all criticism of the Games comes from leftwing social activists. Makoto Yokohari, a professor at the department of urban engineering at the University of Tokyo, says that while he agrees that the Games needs to promote soft legacies, he hasn\u2019t seen any sign of them yet. \u201cThe Olympics may merely be a snapshot event which may become like an illusion within a couple of years,\u201d he says. His criticisms carry weight given he serves on the urban planning and sustainability panel as a part of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics/Paralympics Organising Committee. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my thoughts are shared by most members,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, the respected architect Hiroshi Ota has another criticism: Tokyo 2020 is not daring enough compared with 1964, when buildings such as Kenzo Tange\u2019s Yoyogi gym were immediately seen as design masterpieces. As the Times put it at the time: \u201cThe arenas have approached new heights of architectural imagination and efficiency. In the the press room journalists look over blankly over their typewriters at each other. They still feel stunned as they try to pay tribute.\u201d That, says Ota, will not be happening in 2020. \u201cI am not optimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the design for the new venues were chosen in closed competition and, more generally, I really think Tokyo has missed the chance to include people in urban planning and regeneration.\u201d Rising temperatures There is, however, one thing on which everyone agrees: the potential for Tokyo to be unbearably hot next July and August. The city\u2019s governor, Yuriko Koike, concedes it is the one thing that keeps her up at night, saying: \u201cObviously climate change is a global issue, and it needs to be tackled globally, but the possibility of extreme temperatures in 2020 is a concern for me.\u201d Her fears are well-founded. Last year Japan suffered from a month-long heatwave that saw temperatures peak at 41.1C \u2013 the highest ever recorded in the country \u2013 and caused the deaths of 138 people. However, Koike says the city has put in place a series of measures that will ensure the Games are bearable for athletes and spectators. \u201cWe are introducing heat-blocking road surfaces that can reduce the temperature of the road by eight degrees,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is being installed in more than 100km in the city centre and this covers the marathon course.

      "bodyText": "A helicopter crashed on the roof of a skyscraper in midtown Manhattan early on Monday afternoon. One person, reportedly the pilot, was killed. In a tweet around 2pm on a day of rain and low cloud that obscured the tops of many tall buildings in the city, the Fire Department of New York (FDNY) said: \u201cFDNY members are operating on scene at 787 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, helicopter crash landing.\u201d The New York police department subsequently said the incident was a \u201chard landing on the roof\u201d of the building. \u201cFire has been extinguished,\u201d an NYPD tweet said, adding that people should avoid the area of West 51st Street and 7th Avenue. The FDNY said work was continuing \u201cin response to fuel leaking from the helicopter\u201d and said: \u201cThere is currently one fatality reported.\u201d A White House statement said Donald Trump had \u201cbeen briefed on the helicopter crash in Manhattan and continues to monitor the situation\u201d. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said it was \u201cgathering information\u201d on the crash. The building at 787 Seventh Avenue, close to Broadway theaters and Times Square, is the 54-storey Axa Equitable Center. It opened in 1986 to much comment about its extensive displays of corporate art. As the New York Times reported, such displays included \u201cmurals by Thomas Hart Benton displayed in the lobby; large-scale wall commissions by such well-known contemporaries as Roy Lichtenstein and Sol LeWitt and massive sculptures by Barry Flanagan and Scott Burton.\u201d On Monday police, cordoned off the blocks around the building, barring access to reporters. A police official told the Guardian that although the fire from the crash had been contained, authorities were continuing to clear more of the area because of concerns about falling debris. Wanda Tucker, who works at legal firm on the 21st floor of the building, was there when the helicopter hit. \u201cI was just coming upstairs from lunch,\u201d she said, \u201cand a coworker asked me if I felt the building shake. Then they just told us that we have an emergency situation and that we had to evacuate the building.\u201d Talking to reporters, New York governor Andrew Cuomo referred to common anxieties around initial reports of such incidents, as when a small plane flew into a tall building on the Upper East Side in 2006. \u201cIf you are a New Yorker,\u201d he said, \u201cyou have a level of PTSD from 9/11. And I remember that morning all too well. So as soon as you hear an aircraft hit a building, I think my mind goes where every New Yorker\u2019s mind goes.\u201d Tucker said \u201csomeone got word\u201d what happened while she was in the building stairwell. Asked what went through her head, she said: \u201c9/11.\u201d She said: \u201cI know a lot of people where having anxiety. Once you get stuck you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d On getting out of the building, Tucker said, she called her family and then her boss, to let them know she was safe. Helicopter crashes are not unknown in and around the steepling buildings of midtown and lower Manhattan. Last year, five people died when a sightseeing flight crashed into the East River, in which three people died in a crash in 2011. In 2009, not far from the scene of Monday\u2019s crash, nine people were killed when a sightseeing helicopter collided with a small plane. On Monday, outside the exclusion zone imposed around the skyscraper, on 53rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) worker called Michael, who declined to give his surname, said that though he did not see the crash, he \u201cheard a helicopter going by\u201d. He said: \u201cI figured they were headed to the heliport on 34th Street. I said, \u2018It\u2019s flying too low. It sounded like a freight train.\u201d Then there was silence. \u201cI thought he was trying to make an emergency landing,\u201d he said.",

He is the strong favourite but cannot risk the same experience as his rival Anthony Joshua, whose shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr sent shockwaves through boxing. \u201cAs we saw last week, you can\u2019t overlook anybody,\u201d Fury said. \u201cThis is heavyweight boxing and Tom Schwarz knows if he beats Tyson Fury, then he\u2019s set for life. He becomes a multimillionaire, he gets to headline big shows and all his dreams come true. \u201cBut you\u2019re talking to a king. I\u2019ll figure him out within the first five seconds of the fight. Because that\u2019s what I do. Within five seconds I\u2019ll know exactly what to do with him. \u201cWhen you get paid as much as I am, motivation is easy. Very easy,\u201d Fury said, slipping into the one-liners that come easily to him but are only one facet of the fighter\u2019s complex persona. \u201cThis is a massive attraction of a fight, the UK, Europe, America. This is going to be epic. This is going to be a boxing behemoth.\u201d Arum, whose half century of experience has seen him work with the greats of the sport from Ali to Hagler and Pacquiao, has bet on Fury as the man to bring a big audience to new American streaming player, ESPN+. In the UK the fight will be shown on BT Sport Box Office. \u201cHe has the ability to capture the imagination not only of boxing fans but of sports fans and the public at large,\u201d Arum said. \u201cTyson Fury is the people\u2019s fighter.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an easy job for Bob,\u201d Fury chipped in. \u201cHe has promoted the best fighters in the world and now he gets to promote the most talkable character, the lovable rogue, the handsome British guy.\u201d With a deal for three fights with the WBC champion Deontay Wilder apparently confirmed by Arum, the prospect of future earnings lost is just one more layer of pressure added to Saturday\u2019s fight. Fury is revelling in his transformation from pantomime villain to people\u2019s pugilist following his December draw with Wilder. \u201cHaving people want you to succeed is much better than having people want to knock you out,\u201d he said. Tyson Fury takes on Tom Schwarz, live on BT Sport Box Office, Saturday 15 June.",

      "bodyText": "A memorial honouring the escape of mostly Jewish children from the Nazis, organised by Sir Nicholas Winton, has been damaged in an apparently carefully planned attack. The Valediction Memorial at Prague\u2019s main railway station \u2013 representing trains used to transport 669 children from the Czech capital to Britain \u2013 was left with a long crack across the length of a symbolic window pane. The vandalism appeared to be aimed at disfiguring the shrine\u2019s most evocative feature, a train window engraved with handprints depicting adults and children forced to bid farewell in heartbreaking circumstances. Jan Hunat, a Czech engraver who designed the engraved glass, said he believed it was struck from behind with a hammer after being carefully dislodged from its wooden frame with a chisel or screwdriver. \u201cOne hundred per cent, this was planned,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe person who did this has definitely gone prepared to do it.

Tomas Kraus, secretary of the federation of Czech Jewish organisations, said a lack of surveillance cameras reduced the chances of finding the culprit. The memorial was unveiled in 2017 in recognition of the sacrifice of parents who sent their children to safety knowing they would probably never see them again after the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia. Eight trains carrying children bound for the UK left Prague in the spring and summer of 1939 in evacuations organised by Winton, a former British aid worker who died in 2015 aged 106.

      "body": "<p>When a friend or relative introduces their new partner, it can seem like a case of deja vu. Now research has backed up what many have long suspected: people really do have a type when it comes to coupling up.</p> <p>Psychologists say they have found that people tend to go for partners with personalities similar to their own, and that even when this is taken into account, people\u2019s former and new partners tend to be alike in character. In other words, it might not be a complete surprise that your friend\u2019s new boy- or girlfriend seems just as obnoxious as the last.</p> <p>\u201cThe results revealed a significant degree of distinctive partner similarity, suggesting that there may indeed be a unique type of person each individual ends up with,\u201d the study\u2019s authors write.</p> <p>They say the results may help predict not only who might get together with whom, but also the chances of a relationship\u2019s success.</p> <p>However, Geoff MacDonald, a co-author of the study from the University of Toronto, said that while dating the same type of partner every time might explain why some people\u2019s relationships consistently go wrong, there was another possibility. \u201cI bet what would contribute more to the variance is what are you doing in the relationship,\u201d he said. </p> <p>Writing in the <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1902937116\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>, MacDonald and his colleague, Yoobin Park, report how they used data collected from a long-running study in Germany to come to their conclusions.</p> <p>They looked at patterns of responses to 21 questions probing personality traits, including extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism. During the nine-year study, some participants ended their relationships and found with new partners, who then also completed the questionnaire.</p> <p>Using data from 332 participants and their exes and new partners, the team found that people tended to choose partners with personality patterns similar to their own. But the team also found that current and ex-partners tended to have similar clusters of personality traits, above and beyond similarities to the participant.</p> <p>The researchers say passive factors such as people attending similar social events or working in the same profession may play a role in why exes and new partners tend to have similar personalities. But they say this is unlikely to be the full story, since similarities to the participant themselves \u2013 who might also be expected to be in the shared environment \u2013 were taken into account, meaning active choice of personality appeared to be important too.</p> <p>Experts said the data showed that other factors played a large role in why someone ended up with a partner of a certain type. \u201cFor example, active processes like \u2018I seek out partners who are extroverted and want to date them\u2019 and passive processes like \u2018I am extroverted and so I go to parties where I meet other extroverted people\u2019 all add up to only 8% of the personality variance in who we choose as a partner,\u201d said Dr Paul Eastwick, of the University of California, Davis, who was not part of the research team.</p> <p>Robin Dunbar, a professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford University, said there had been much debate about whether or not opposites attract in relationships. \u201cOur own research has shown that friends tend to resemble each other \u2013 a phenomenon known as homophily,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it seems we have proof that it also applies to romantic partners, especially in respect of their personalities.\u201d</p> <p>That might not be too surprising, he said. \u201cAfter all, for a relationship to last, whether its a friendship or a romantic relationship, you really need to be interested in the same things and have the same attitudes to life \u2013 otherwise you just end up arguing all the time.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "When a friend or relative introduces their new partner, it can seem like a case of deja vu. Now research has backed up what many have long suspected: people really do have a type when it comes to coupling up. Psychologists say they have found that people tend to go for partners with personalities similar to their own, and that even when this is taken into account, people\u2019s former and new partners tend to be alike in character. In other words, it might not be a complete surprise that your friend\u2019s new boy- or girlfriend seems just as obnoxious as the last. \u201cThe results revealed a significant degree of distinctive partner similarity, suggesting that there may indeed be a unique type of person each individual ends up with,\u201d the study\u2019s authors write. They say the results may help predict not only who might get together with whom, but also the chances of a relationship\u2019s success. However, Geoff MacDonald, a co-author of the study from the University of Toronto, said that while dating the same type of partner every time might explain why some people\u2019s relationships consistently go wrong, there was another possibility. \u201cI bet what would contribute more to the variance is what are you doing in the relationship,\u201d he said. Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, MacDonald and his colleague, Yoobin Park, report how they used data collected from a long-running study in Germany to come to their conclusions. They looked at patterns of responses to 21 questions probing personality traits, including extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism. During the nine-year study, some participants ended their relationships and found with new partners, who then also completed the questionnaire. Using data from 332 participants and their exes and new partners, the team found that people tended to choose partners with personality patterns similar to their own. But the team also found that current and ex-partners tended to have similar clusters of personality traits, above and beyond similarities to the participant. The researchers say passive factors such as people attending similar social events or working in the same profession may play a role in why exes and new partners tend to have similar personalities. But they say this is unlikely to be the full story, since similarities to the participant themselves \u2013 who might also be expected to be in the shared environment \u2013 were taken into account, meaning active choice of personality appeared to be important too. Experts said the data showed that other factors played a large role in why someone ended up with a partner of a certain type. \u201cFor example, active processes like \u2018I seek out partners who are extroverted and want to date them\u2019 and passive processes like \u2018I am extroverted and so I go to parties where I meet other extroverted people\u2019 all add up to only 8% of the personality variance in who we choose as a partner,\u201d said Dr Paul Eastwick, of the University of California, Davis, who was not part of the research team. Robin Dunbar, a professor of evolutionary psychology at Oxford University, said there had been much debate about whether or not opposites attract in relationships. \u201cOur own research has shown that friends tend to resemble each other \u2013 a phenomenon known as homophily,\u201d he said. \u201cNow it seems we have proof that it also applies to romantic partners, especially in respect of their personalities.\u201d That might not be too surprising, he said. \u201cAfter all, for a relationship to last, whether its a friendship or a romantic relationship, you really need to be interested in the same things and have the same attitudes to life \u2013 otherwise you just end up arguing all the time.\u201d",

But as the BBC announces that most over-75s will have to start paying the \u00a3154.50 television licence fee, the legacy of the former chancellor\u2019s spending cuts is still being felt. The seeds of the licence fee decision lie in a secret deal struck in the immediate aftermath of the 2015 general election, when the Conservatives returned with an unexpected parliamentary majority. With the Liberal Democrats no longer in coalition, an uninhibited Tory government moved fast to impose new spending controls \u2013 hashing out a new settlement with the BBC director general, Tony Hall, in clandestine talks that lasted just a week.

      "bodyText": "The world\u2019s most expensive artwork \u2013 Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s masterpiece Salvator Mundi \u2013 has reportedly been installed on Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s superyacht. The location of the painting has been a mystery since it was sold for a record $450m (\u00a3350m) at auction by Christie\u2019s in New York in 2017. On Monday, Artnet, an art industry news service, reported that the 500-year-old painting was being kept on Prince Mohammed\u2019s \u20ac500m (\u00a3440m) 134m yacht, Serene. Artnet said \u201ctwo principals involved in the transaction\u201d had told its reporter that \u201cthe work was whisked away in the middle of the night on MBS\u2019s plane and relocated to his yacht, the Serene\u201d. The Salvator Mundi (Latin for Saviour of the World), which has been at the centre of a storm of controversy over suggestions that it was painted by one of Leonardo\u2019s assistants and not the man himself, had been due to go on display at a Middle East outpost of Paris\u2019s Louvre gallery last September. \u201cHaving spent so long undiscovered, this masterpiece is now our gift to the world,\u201d Mohamed Khalifa al-Mubarak, the chairman of Abu Dhabi\u2019s department of culture and tourism, said in June 2018. \u201cWe look forward to welcoming people from near and far to witness its beauty.\u201d However, just week\u2019s before the scheduled unveiling on 18 September, the opening was postponed and has not been rescheduled. The Saudi embassies in London and Washington did not respond to requests for comment on the painting\u2019s whereabouts. A spokeswoman for Christie\u2019s did not comment on the location of the painting or its provenance. Earlier this month, one of the world\u2019s leading experts on Leonardo criticised Christie\u2019s for wrongly suggesting in its cataloguing of the Salvator Mundi that she was among scholars who had attributed the picture to the Renaissance master. Dr Carmen Bambach, a curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, told the Guardian: \u201cThat is not representative of my opinion.\u201d The identity of the buyer remained a secret following the auction until the New York Times disclosed that that it had been bought by a little-known member of the Saudi royal family, Prince Bader bin Abdullah bin Mohammed bin Farhan al-Saud. He is a close friend of Prince Mohammed and after the auction was named the country\u2019s first minister of culture. MarineTraffic, an app that tracks vessels including superyachts, shows that Serene is currently at Port Said, an Egyptian city where the the Suez Canal meets the Mediterranean Sea. The Guardian has previously reported on the growing trend for billionaires installing world-renowned masterpieces on their superyachts. Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the owner of Manchester City and deputy prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has several hundred pieces aboard his \u00a3350m superyacht, Topaz. A reporter looking in the windows of Joe Lewis\u2019s \u00a3200m superyacht, Aviva, when it moored on the Thames last year, discovered that Francis Bacon\u2019s Triptych 1974\u20131977 was hanging in gold frames on the lower deck. The painting, whose subject is the death of Bacon\u2019s lover George Dyer, was included in Tate Britain\u2019s blockbuster Bacon and Freud exhibition last summer. The British-born Lewis, who has an estimated \u00a33.9bn fortune, owns a majority stake in Tottenham football club and lives in the tax-friendly Bahamas, has what he describes as \u201cone of the largest private art collections in the world\u201d. It includes paintings by Degas, Freud, Klimt, Modigliani, Matisse and Picasso, and sculptures by Moore, Degas and Di Modica. It is not known which are kept on his yacht.",

A report into the cases of more than 20 girls in Huddersfield found that social workers had evidence to conclude that two teenage victims were at risk of serious harm, yet took no action. Dr Mark Peel, the author of the review, said children\u2019s services officers knew that the two 16-year-olds, one of whom had learning difficulties, were \u201cmost likely to have been engaged in inappropriate, exploitative and illegal sexual activity\u201d with older men. He added: \u201cIn both instances, however, it would appear that, other than recording this information, no subsequent preventative safeguarding action was taken, and that thus an opportunity to break the [child sexual exploitation] ring operating in Kirklees, and to protect these girls directly and others more generally, was lost.\u201d The report, published on Monday, examined the files of 22 girls involved in the prosecution of 20 men who were given lengthy jail sentences last year after being convicted of a \u201cvile and wicked\u201d campaign of abuse spanning from 2004 to 2011. Three trials heard how 15 vulnerable girls, aged as young as 11, fell victim to a grooming ring and were plied with drugs and alcohol before being subjected to abuse that was \u201cat the top of the scale\u201d of severity. Peel, a social work academic, said that nothing relating to child sexual exploitation [CSE] was flagged up in the majority of cases, but that this may have been because social work professionals were not looking for CSE at that time. However, he found that in the cases of two girls, referred to as Girl 4 and Girl 8, there was intelligence that they were at risk of serious harm.

It\u2019s been debated previously, and we know this type of legislation is in place in other major economies such as the United States and Britain and been very successful,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2019/jun/08/australias-standing-in-pacific-has-plummeted-because-of-our-climate-change-failure\">Australia's standing in Pacific has plummeted because of our climate change failure | Dermot O'Gorman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked whether he would support non-government amendments when the package is debated in the new parliament, Pitt said: \u201cI don\u2019t support anything I haven\u2019t seen and I\u2019m yet to read anything that\u2019s been put forward, but in terms of a general principle, I certainly support extending divestiture powers, particularly into areas like the supermarket duopoly, which we know has been detrimental to regional producers for a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>Given Scott Morrison post-election governs in majority, the government should be able to steer the package through the lower house without amendments, unless Pitt is joined by more Nationals colleagues in a concerted push to broaden the divestiture proposal in the current legislation. The package is also vulnerable during Senate debate in the event any Nationals decide to break ranks.</p> <p>Any effort by the Nationals to beef up the divestiture power proposed in the big stick package would prompt significant pushback from Liberals. Liberals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/dec/03/coalition-revises-energy-big-stick-policy-following-backbench-objections\">have already forced changes to the government package</a> on the basis they were philosophically uncomfortable with it, because breaking up private companies offends core liberal values.</p> <p>The government had to overhaul its original proposal last December because of concerns expressed by a number of Liberal backbenchers. The energy sector and major business groups are also vociferous opponents of the package and have engaged in a substantial lobbying effort to try to scuttle it.</p> <p>Fearing pre-election the package was going to be put on the go slow, Pitt was one of a group of Nationals including George Christensen, Michelle Landry, Ken O\u2019Dowd, Llew O\u2019Brien and Barry O\u2019Sullivan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/mar/07/queensland-nationals-demand-action-on-energy-before-federal-election\">who put their leader, Michael McCormack, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, on notice</a> that the \u201cbig stick\u201d package needed to be passed as a matter of priority.</p> <p>The same group is also championing government underwriting for a new coal-fired power station in Queensland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/29/anthony-albanese-refuses-to-give-labor-position-on-coalitions-big-stick-energy-laws\">Anthony Albanese refuses to give Labor position on Coalition's 'big stick' energy laws</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taylor has indicated the \u201cbig stick\u201d package will return for consideration when the new parliament reconvenes in July.</p> <p>At the end of May, the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia he would look to \u201cbroaden the application of divestiture across all sectors of the economy\u201d once the divestiture package reached the Senate, because once the principle was accepted for one sector, it should be universally applied.</p> <p>Patrick also criticised the Morrison government for having a \u201chodgepodge\u201d energy policy, and he said Centre Alliance positions on energy matters would be determined \u201cin the context of providing clean, reliable and affordable power for Australians\u201d.</p> <p>Crossbench amendments are relevant if Labor continues to oppose the package, which it did during the last parliament. The new Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has so far <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/may/29/anthony-albanese-refuses-to-give-labor-position-on-coalitions-big-stick-energy-laws\">declined to say</a> whether or not Labor will maintain that position in the new term.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Nationals MP Keith Pitt has broken ranks to endorse a push by the Centre Alliance to legislate an economy-wide power to break up big companies when the Morrison government\u2019s controversial \u201cbig stick\u201d energy package returns to parliament in July. The Queensland National, who has been one of the most vocal advocates of the \u201cbig stick\u201d legislation, which allows energy companies to be broken up if they engage in price gouging, says a power to break up big companies should apply right across the economy, not just in the energy sector. Asked whether he supported a proposal by the Centre Alliance to broaden the divestiture power, Pitt told Guardian Australia: \u201cI agree with them.\u201d \u201cThis has been the position of the Nationals and supported by Nationals members for a long time. It\u2019s been debated previously, and we know this type of legislation is in place in other major economies such as the United States and Britain and been very successful,\u201d he said. Asked whether he would support non-government amendments when the package is debated in the new parliament, Pitt said: \u201cI don\u2019t support anything I haven\u2019t seen and I\u2019m yet to read anything that\u2019s been put forward, but in terms of a general principle, I certainly support extending divestiture powers, particularly into areas like the supermarket duopoly, which we know has been detrimental to regional producers for a very long time.\u201d Given Scott Morrison post-election governs in majority, the government should be able to steer the package through the lower house without amendments, unless Pitt is joined by more Nationals colleagues in a concerted push to broaden the divestiture proposal in the current legislation. The package is also vulnerable during Senate debate in the event any Nationals decide to break ranks. Any effort by the Nationals to beef up the divestiture power proposed in the big stick package would prompt significant pushback from Liberals. Liberals have already forced changes to the government package on the basis they were philosophically uncomfortable with it, because breaking up private companies offends core liberal values. The government had to overhaul its original proposal last December because of concerns expressed by a number of Liberal backbenchers. The energy sector and major business groups are also vociferous opponents of the package and have engaged in a substantial lobbying effort to try to scuttle it. Fearing pre-election the package was going to be put on the go slow, Pitt was one of a group of Nationals including George Christensen, Michelle Landry, Ken O\u2019Dowd, Llew O\u2019Brien and Barry O\u2019Sullivan who put their leader, Michael McCormack, and the energy minister, Angus Taylor, on notice that the \u201cbig stick\u201d package needed to be passed as a matter of priority. The same group is also championing government underwriting for a new coal-fired power station in Queensland. Taylor has indicated the \u201cbig stick\u201d package will return for consideration when the new parliament reconvenes in July. At the end of May, the Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick told Guardian Australia he would look to \u201cbroaden the application of divestiture across all sectors of the economy\u201d once the divestiture package reached the Senate, because once the principle was accepted for one sector, it should be universally applied. Patrick also criticised the Morrison government for having a \u201chodgepodge\u201d energy policy, and he said Centre Alliance positions on energy matters would be determined \u201cin the context of providing clean, reliable and affordable power for Australians\u201d. Crossbench amendments are relevant if Labor continues to oppose the package, which it did during the last parliament. The new Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has so far declined to say whether or not Labor will maintain that position in the new term.",

She replies sometimes, he says, laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dickhead, Dad,\u201d is a phrase she was fond of, he says.</p> <p>\u201cDeath is the atom bomb [for] emotions; if your internal wounds were visible you\u2019d be rushed to hospital and you\u2019d be in intensive care,\u201d says Longley, speaking from his home in Auckland, New Zealand.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about death; there\u2019s no duck, cover and hold routine. We know what to do in an earthquake but we don\u2019t know what to say or do if someone dies. We are kind of awkward about it. It\u2019s like a bad Monty Python sketch.\u201d</p> <p>Eight years ago Emily was studying at Brockenhurst College and living with her grandparents in Bournemouth, Dorset, when when she was strangled by her 20-year-old former boyfriend, Elliot Turner. Turner\u2019s parents were accused of helping their son cover up the crime, and were <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9381174/Elliot-Turner-murder-compassionate-judge-jails-parents-for-27-months.html\">later sentenced to 27 months in jail</a> for perverting the course of justice. Their son, who had displayed controlling, jealous and threatening behaviour towards Longley during their brief relationship, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 16 years. Until recently, he remained unrepentant for his crime. Longley has not forgiven him.</p> <p>This week Longley, a journalist, will release a three-part podcast exploring death, grief and how to survive after your world explodes. Piecing together his story with those of others who have lost someone, and the opinions of grief experts, the podcast also features archival home recordings that capture Emily\u2019s playfulness and spirit, as well as key recordings from throughout the murder trial.</p> <p>It\u2019s confronting listening but also moving and universal in its themes, with its gentle urging that grief can be done better and more humanely.</p> <p>Longley says the podcast is the result of years of grappling with grief. He wanted to design a how-to guide, a \u201cmetaphorical hug\u201d for those who might have lost someone, or are trying to support someone who has.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ccc40924957988c2ab74bc3a767917739e333112\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ccc40924957988c2ab74bc3a767917739e333112/35_75_685_465/500.jpg\" alt=\"Emily and Mark Longley\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wanted human contact, but people didn\u2019t know how to talk to me\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied by Mark Longley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI found the whole process of grief quite strange,\u201d he says. \u201cI noticed people were really uncomfortable talking to me about grief and about Emily.</p> <p>\u201cI was in a weird paradox where I felt isolated and I wanted human contact, but people didn\u2019t know how to talk to me. The journalist in me thought this was interesting and I wanted to examine it.\u201d</p> <p>Last year Longley spoke at the Auckland vigil for the murdered British backpacker Grace Millane. Since Emily\u2019s death he has become a passionate advocate for White Ribbon.</p> <p>The lawyers working on Emily\u2019s case were clear from the beginning, Longley says, that her death had all the hallmarks of domestic violence.</p> <p>It still haunts Longley that no one saw the warning signs of her toxic relationship with Turner. He believes she would still be alive if someone had recognised the relationship for what it was, and helped her escape.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jul/26/new-zealand-paid-domestic-violence-leave-jan-logie\">'A huge win': New Zealand brings in paid domestic violence leave</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although Emily was killed in the UK, Longley\u2019s research into domestic violence has centred on his home of New Zealand, which has one of the worst rates of intimate partner violence in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. <a href=\"https://cpb-ap-se2.wpmucdn.com/blogs.auckland.ac.nz/dist/6/414/files/2018/11/Every-4-minutes-A-discussion-paper-on-preventing-family-violence-in-New-Zealand.-Lambie-report-8.11.18-x43nf4.pdf\">Police attend a family violence incident once every four minutes in the country</a>, and the Labour coalition government has pumped a record NZ$320m into the sector in an attempt to tackle the horrendous statistics.</p> <p>Longley strongly believes that more of the responsibility of confronting domestic violence lies with men.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the most common questions in family violence is, why didn\u2019t she leave him?

      "bodyText": "Every night before Mark Longley goes to sleep, he says goodnight to a picture of his 17-year-old daughter Emily, murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2011. Longley, 51 \u2013 a warm and sensitive man \u2013 also talks to Emily in his head; she was his \u201cmate\u201d as well as his daughter. She replies sometimes, he says, laughing. \u201cDon\u2019t be a dickhead, Dad,\u201d is a phrase she was fond of, he says. \u201cDeath is the atom bomb [for] emotions; if your internal wounds were visible you\u2019d be rushed to hospital and you\u2019d be in intensive care,\u201d says Longley, speaking from his home in Auckland, New Zealand. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about death; there\u2019s no duck, cover and hold routine. We know what to do in an earthquake but we don\u2019t know what to say or do if someone dies. We are kind of awkward about it. It\u2019s like a bad Monty Python sketch.\u201d Eight years ago Emily was studying at Brockenhurst College and living with her grandparents in Bournemouth, Dorset, when when she was strangled by her 20-year-old former boyfriend, Elliot Turner. Turner\u2019s parents were accused of helping their son cover up the crime, and were later sentenced to 27 months in jail for perverting the course of justice. Their son, who had displayed controlling, jealous and threatening behaviour towards Longley during their brief relationship, was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 16 years. Until recently, he remained unrepentant for his crime. Longley has not forgiven him. This week Longley, a journalist, will release a three-part podcast exploring death, grief and how to survive after your world explodes. Piecing together his story with those of others who have lost someone, and the opinions of grief experts, the podcast also features archival home recordings that capture Emily\u2019s playfulness and spirit, as well as key recordings from throughout the murder trial. It\u2019s confronting listening but also moving and universal in its themes, with its gentle urging that grief can be done better and more humanely. Longley says the podcast is the result of years of grappling with grief. He wanted to design a how-to guide, a \u201cmetaphorical hug\u201d for those who might have lost someone, or are trying to support someone who has. \u201cI found the whole process of grief quite strange,\u201d he says. \u201cI noticed people were really uncomfortable talking to me about grief and about Emily. \u201cI was in a weird paradox where I felt isolated and I wanted human contact, but people didn\u2019t know how to talk to me. The journalist in me thought this was interesting and I wanted to examine it.\u201d Last year Longley spoke at the Auckland vigil for the murdered British backpacker Grace Millane. Since Emily\u2019s death he has become a passionate advocate for White Ribbon. The lawyers working on Emily\u2019s case were clear from the beginning, Longley says, that her death had all the hallmarks of domestic violence. It still haunts Longley that no one saw the warning signs of her toxic relationship with Turner. He believes she would still be alive if someone had recognised the relationship for what it was, and helped her escape. Although Emily was killed in the UK, Longley\u2019s research into domestic violence has centred on his home of New Zealand, which has one of the worst rates of intimate partner violence in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Police attend a family violence incident once every four minutes in the country, and the Labour coalition government has pumped a record NZ$320m into the sector in an attempt to tackle the horrendous statistics. Longley strongly believes that more of the responsibility of confronting domestic violence lies with men. \u201cOne of the most common questions in family violence is, why didn\u2019t she leave him? Not, why did he hit her?\u201d says Longley. \u201cThe man is out of that equation, all the onus is on the woman, there\u2019s no suggestion the man shouldn\u2019t have been hitting her. And we need to reverse that. It shouldn\u2019t be up to the woman to leave and go to a refuge, it should be up to the man to stop being violent.\u201d Longley is preparing for a \u201cbit of a break\u201d after tackling the experience of grief so intimately but is then considering another podcast, this time examining domestic violence. It has been close to a decade since Emily died but Longley says grief never ends. \u201cWhat a load of rubbish closure is,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople keep asking if you have closure. You never have closure. I think people wanted to feel I had closed that [the murder] off so we could all move on. You never move on. I miss Emily every day, I think about her every day. And, God forbid, if you ever did move on, it would be like saying that person didn\u2019t exist.\u201d \u2022 Death: A podcast about love, grief and hope is released on 12 June, and is available on iTunes, Spotify, Soundcloud and all major podcast apps.

      "bodyText": "Here is the match report ... While there\u2019s delight for Argentina at securing a point, there\u2019s only frustration for Japan. The 2011 champions struggled to create chances and failed to play with enough speed or intensity. It\u2019s a worrying result for them before games against Scotland and England. They\u2019ll need a big improvement if they\u2019re to qualify from Group D, which is currently topped by England after their win over Scotland yesterday. Thanks for reading and emailing. Bye. It\u2019s all over. Argentina have their first ever point at a World Cup and are celebrating like they\u2019ve just become champions. There are emotional scenes from their exhausted players. 90 min+1: There will be four added minutes and Japan almost score in the first of them following a mix-up in the Argentina defence, only for Correa to push Hasegawa\u2019s close-range effort away. 90 min: Takarada replaces Sugasawa. 88 min: Sugita whacks one over from 25 yards. 86 min: Stabile sends the free-kick into the area, but Coronel\u2019s header bounces harmlessly wide. 85 min: Iwabuchi\u2019s booked for tugging back the impressive Banini. 83 min: Larroquette blazes miles wide from 25 yards. 82 min: Jaimes\u2019s deflected shot runs through to Yamashita, who earns herself a second mention in this MBM. 79 min: Argentina make their final change, Coronel on for Benitez. 77 min: Argentina make their second change: Larroquette replaces Bonsegundo. 76 min: This will be over soon. I\u2019m never forgiving Argentina for this. 73 min: Bonsegundo breaks into the Japan area, but her tame shot goes straight at Yamashita, who\u2019s earned her first mention in this MBM. 72 min: Cometti is in the wars again. She\u2019s down after being caught by Sugasawa. 69 min: This really wouldn\u2019t be a great result for Japan. They could do with a win before facing England and Scotland, both of whom will expect to beat this limited Argentina side. 65 min: Argentina have an attack! Inevitably it\u2019s Banini who creates the danger, lolloping down the left and finding Sole Jaimes, who cuts inside and sees a shot blocked by Minami. 64 min: Argentina make their first change, Santana on for Bravo, who makes a very slow exit from the pitch. They\u2019re already wasting time. 61 min: Nakajima cuts inside and tries to slip a pass through to Sugita. It\u2019s overhit, though, allowing Correa to smother. 57 min: Japan make their second change, Iwabuchi on for Yokoyama. 56 min: Japan attack down the right, Nakajima charging down the right and pulling a ball back into the area. Sugita cleverly steps over it, fooling the Argentinian defenders, but Hasegawa disappointingly screws her shot wide from 12 yards. 54 min: Japan have dozed off again. 51 min: Sameshima skips round Bonseundo far too easily on the left and scoots into the Argentina box, only for Gomez to deny her with a sliding challenge. 50 min: Yokoyama suddenly wakes everyone up with a dipping piledriver from 30 yards. Correa plunges down to her right to make the save, but she does so unconvincingly, only succeeding in pushing the ball out to Sugasawa. The striker runs on to the rebound - but she only manages to screw it over the bar from close range. Japan should lead. 48 min: There\u2019s little sign of any extra intensity from Japan yet. 46 min: Japan get the second half underway. Nothing has happened. See you in 15 minutes. 45 min+2: Sugita picks up a yellow card for catching Banini with a stray arm to the face. A more pedantic referee might have sent her off for that, though Banini did milk it for all it was worth. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. 44 min: This has not been a good half. Japan look like they have no idea how to break Argentina down. They\u2019ve barely created anything. 42 min: Hope for Edward Thomas! \u201cIt\u2019s on Fox Sports 1,\u201d Raimond Skrupsis says. 38 min: Shimizu picks up a yellow for clattering into Banini from behind. Banini stays down for a while and needs some attention from the physio. A little frustration\u2019s creeping into Japan. 37 min: \u201cCan\u2019t find this on TV in the USA (also, I\u2019m at work), so let me know: Does either performance so far cause concern for an England fan?\u201d Edward Thomas says. \u201cAnd how do you think Scotland will fare against both (I\u2019m hoping for a Scotland upset myself).\u201d I imagine England wouldn\u2019t see too much to fear so far, while Scotland would feel pretty confident about their chances as well. That said I was covering the tennis yesterday, so I didn\u2019t see the England v Scotland game. 33 min: Japan are looking to get the ball to Hasegawa at every opportunity, but Argentina have recognised that ploy and are working to shut off the supply line. The underdogs have been organised so far. It\u2019s not making for a great spectacle, but this Pulisian approach could bring them a positive approach. 29 min: Japan take the corner short and make a hot mess of it. That was a complete waste of time. 28 min: For all their pretty football Japan do look quite toothless. They have a corner on the right, though, Barroso conceding it rather needlessly. 25 min: Gomez charges into space down the right but she gets a nosebleed and kicks the ball at no one in particular. How odd. Japan counter and a promising move ends with Miura firing over from 20 yards. 23 min: \u201cIn what has been a solid World Cup so far, my heart wants to see the Japanese women further the excitement surrounding the global tournament by regaining their glory days through unorthodox and sensational football!\u201d OB Jato says. \u201cTheir manager\u2019s freestyle-encouraging tactics can do very well once the team gets on a collective roll, which can be sustained till the very end considering the short length of the tournament. Today has the potential to be the beginning of something very special. Go on, gals, give us an unexpected treat.\u201d 22 min: Sugasawa and Cometti are both back on. 20 min: We\u2019ve got ourselves a stoppage, with Sugasawa receiving treatment for an arm problem on the side of the pitch. She should be fine to continue. Argentina\u2019s Cometti is also in the wars. 16 min: Emails please! 13 min: The pattern is set, Japan probing, Argentina sitting. Argentina aren\u2019t using the ball very well. 10 min: Another chance for Japan, Sugasawa finding space at the far post, but the striker can only head straight at Correa. The goalkeeper makes an easy save. 9 min: Japan press and open Argentina up when Miura wins a 50-50 on the edge of the area, forcing the ball through to the unmarked Nakajima. The winger has plenty of space but she rushes her shot and the ball dribbles harmlessly wide. With more composure she could have rolled a simple pass across to Sugasawa, who was all alone in the middle. 6 min: It\u2019s been a tight start, though Japan are dominating possession. 5 min: Hasegawa, who\u2019s made a good start on the left, dribbles into the Argentina area and for a moment Japan look like they\u2019re in business. Yet Argentina manage to crowd the winger out and the move dies a speedy death. 3 min: Hasegawa produces a sublime piece of skill, lobbing the ball over Bravo\u2019s head in midfield, but she can\u2019t make any real progress. Peep! Argentina, in their famous light blue and white stripes, get the game underway. Japan are in a darker shade of blue. The anthems are done. There\u2019s a bright, positive atmosphere at the Parc Des Princes on a sunny afternoon in Paris. The stadium\u2019s not full, but there\u2019s a good crowd. Here come the teams! It\u2019s time for the anthems. Pre-match reading Argentina: Correa; Gomez, Barroso, Cometti, Stabile; Banini, Bravo, Benitez, Mayorga, Bonsegundo; Sole Jaimes. Japan: Yamashita; Shimizu, Kumagai, Minami, Sameshima; Nakajima, Sugita, Miura, Hasegawa; Yokoyama, Sugasawa. Referee: Stephanie Frappart (France). Hello.

England are expected to finish top of Group D, especially after opening with a win over Scotland in Nice yesterday, but Japan will feel they have enough to claim second spot. A good start would do them the world of good. Argentina, making their third appearance at a World Cup, have had little preparation and could be there for the taking. Maybe Japan could warm up for the Olympics by sticking in a few goals here. Or perhaps Argentina have a few surprises in store. Kick-off: 5pm BST, 6pm CET.",

      "bodyText": "Brazil has been rocked by allegations that a prominent judge repeatedly collaborated with prosecutors during high-profile corruption investigations \u2013 including the controversial case that imprisoned former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. According to the Intercept, S\u00e9rgio Moro gave prosecutors strategic advice, criticism and tips during the sprawling corruption investigation known as Operation Car Wash that jailed hundreds of executives, politicians and middlemen. Prosecutors also allegedly discussed strategies to block a newspaper\u2019s attempts to interview Lula during last year\u2019s election campaign, according to the Intercept, which published cellphone chats it said it had received from an anonymous source. Opinion polls had indicated that Lula was likely to win the 2018 presidential poll until he was imprisoned and forced out of the race. His last-minute replacement, Fernando Haddad was beaten by the far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 who then appointed Moro as justice minister. Lula has been imprisoned since April 2018. He was handed a nine-year prison sentence in 2017 by Moro, who ruled that he received bribes from a construction company in the shape of a seaside apartment renovated for him. On Sunday, the Intercept published excerpts from what it described as an \u201cenormous trove\u201d of group chats on the encrypted phone app Telegram, along with audio, video and other documentation. Excerpts of conversations between prosecutors on the Telegram cellphone app appear to show Deltan Dallagnol, the lead prosecutor in the Car Wash investigation, expressing doubts over the strength of the case against Lula in September 2016, four days before filing the indictment. \u201cIt\u2019s like stopping the other team from playing.

      "body": "<p>James Bond has appeared behind the wheel of many vehicles: from a Lotus Esprit that turned into a submarine to a rather less glamorous Ford Mondeo. But Aston Martin is the carmaker most closely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/13/james-bond-to-drive-electric-aston-martin-in-new-movie\">associated with the fictional spy</a>, and it is hoping its new SUV can cause as much of a stir as 007\u2019s sleek sports cars.</p> <p>The first DBX will leave the production line at Aston Martin Lagonda\u2019s new factory in St Athan, south Wales, in the first half of 2020, in a major departure for the British manufacturer as it tries to rapidly double its annual production numbers.</p> <p>The DBX, the brand\u2019s first sports utility vehicle in its 106-year history, is part of a strategy by the chief executive, Andy Palmer, to bring the carmaker into the modern era and broaden its appeal beyond its mainly male sports car clientele.</p> <p>Speaking at the factory, which is already producing test vehicles, Palmer said Aston Martin was targeting the tens of thousands of multimillionaire women in countries such as the US and China who are able to spend more than \u00a3140,000 on a car.</p> <p>\u201cThe DBX is seen as being neither male- nor female-biased \u2013 it\u2019s neutral,\u201d he said, referring to the results of testing with wealthy SUV owners.</p> <p>The facility, still in the process of being completed, is situated on an old RAF base, which the Ministry of Defence handed over for commercial use after political interventions to secure employment in the UK. The Welsh government is paying for a new access road.</p> <p>The factory will eventually employ about 1,000 people \u2013 a particular boon for south Wales, which fought off competition from Birmingham, Alabama, as well as from British rivals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b2236fbb46360cf5e43b730fea02c0880e9f073\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b2236fbb46360cf5e43b730fea02c0880e9f073/0_306_5300_3180/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Aston Martin DBX on the production line in St Athan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Aston Martin DBX on the production line in St Athan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Max Earey/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The site is just a 20-minute drive from Ford\u2019s Bridgend engine plant, which the US carmaker last week said would close in September 2020, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/06/ford-to-close-bridgend-factory-in-september-2020\">at the cost of 1,700 jobs</a>. But they will not find it easy to switch to Aston Martin. Keith Stanton, Aston Martin\u2019s head of manufacturing, said he expected that many Ford employees would have transferable skills but in previous rounds of recruitment there had been 100 candidates for every available job.</p> <p>Ford\u2019s decision came during one of the most challenging periods faced by the British car industry, with carmakers struggling with slumping demand for diesel engines amid growing concerns about air pollution, as well as a near freeze in investment because of Brexit uncertainty.</p> <p>In February the Japanese carmaker Honda announced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/20/fanciful-to-say-honda-didnt-consider-brexit-when-closing-swindon-sir-david-warren\">its Swindon factory would close in 2021</a>, and Nissan abandoned a decision to invest in building its new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/22/nissan-x-trail-car-review-suv-7-seater-the-dirtier-it-gets-the-happier-it-is\">X-Trail</a> vehicle at its Sunderland plant, with Brexit in particular thought by industry experts to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/feb/21/honda-european-chief-outlined-no-deal-brexit-concerns-in-2018\">been a contributing factor</a>.</p> <p>Aston Martin has not been immune. It has struggled since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/03/aston-martin-ipo-flotation-lse\">floating in October at \u00a319 </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/oct/03/aston-martin-ipo-flotation-lse\">a share</a>, when the company was valued at about \u00a34.3bn.

      "bodyText": "James Bond has appeared behind the wheel of many vehicles: from a Lotus Esprit that turned into a submarine to a rather less glamorous Ford Mondeo. But Aston Martin is the carmaker most closely associated with the fictional spy, and it is hoping its new SUV can cause as much of a stir as 007\u2019s sleek sports cars. The first DBX will leave the production line at Aston Martin Lagonda\u2019s new factory in St Athan, south Wales, in the first half of 2020, in a major departure for the British manufacturer as it tries to rapidly double its annual production numbers. The DBX, the brand\u2019s first sports utility vehicle in its 106-year history, is part of a strategy by the chief executive, Andy Palmer, to bring the carmaker into the modern era and broaden its appeal beyond its mainly male sports car clientele. Speaking at the factory, which is already producing test vehicles, Palmer said Aston Martin was targeting the tens of thousands of multimillionaire women in countries such as the US and China who are able to spend more than \u00a3140,000 on a car. \u201cThe DBX is seen as being neither male- nor female-biased \u2013 it\u2019s neutral,\u201d he said, referring to the results of testing with wealthy SUV owners. The facility, still in the process of being completed, is situated on an old RAF base, which the Ministry of Defence handed over for commercial use after political interventions to secure employment in the UK. The Welsh government is paying for a new access road. The factory will eventually employ about 1,000 people \u2013 a particular boon for south Wales, which fought off competition from Birmingham, Alabama, as well as from British rivals. The site is just a 20-minute drive from Ford\u2019s Bridgend engine plant, which the US carmaker last week said would close in September 2020, at the cost of 1,700 jobs. But they will not find it easy to switch to Aston Martin. Keith Stanton, Aston Martin\u2019s head of manufacturing, said he expected that many Ford employees would have transferable skills but in previous rounds of recruitment there had been 100 candidates for every available job. Ford\u2019s decision came during one of the most challenging periods faced by the British car industry, with carmakers struggling with slumping demand for diesel engines amid growing concerns about air pollution, as well as a near freeze in investment because of Brexit uncertainty. In February the Japanese carmaker Honda announced its Swindon factory would close in 2021, and Nissan abandoned a decision to invest in building its new X-Trail vehicle at its Sunderland plant, with Brexit in particular thought by industry experts to have been a contributing factor. Aston Martin has not been immune. It has struggled since floating in October at \u00a319 a share, when the company was valued at about \u00a34.3bn. Since then the value of Britain\u2019s only listed carmaker has fallen by almost half, trading at just over \u00a310 on Monday. The company has been hit by higher than expected marketing costs, as well as the considerable costs of carrying out the initial public offering and \u00a330m set aside for Brexit preparations. It made a loss before tax of \u00a317.3m in the first quarter of the year. However, Aston Martin is still having success in China. While lower-cost carmakers have struggled as sales to Chinese buyers last year fell for the first time in almost three decades, Palmer said he had seen little sign of any difficulty selling in China. The St Athan factory will eventually build about 7,000 vehicles, matching Aston Martin\u2019s main facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire. Two new models under the Lagonda luxury marque, which has been revived as a battery electric vehicle brand, will account for about 2,000 of these. But before that, if Palmer\u2019s plans succeed, the DBX SUV should become Aston Martin\u2019s best-selling car, with 4,000 to be built in 2021. \u2022 This article was amended on 12 June 2019 because an earlier version said Aston Martin expected to build5,000 DBX SUVs at the St Athan factory. That is the factory\u2019s production capacity; the target is 4,000. This has been corrected.",

      "body": "<p>As World Cup openers go, I thought it was a very assured and mature performance from England considering the anticipation there had been building up to the game against Scotland. Because of the rivalry between the two countries and the familiarity that exists among the players, it was always going to be a tricky hurdle to overcome for Phil Neville\u2019s side and I was impressed by the way they approached the task. England look like they are mentally prepared to play seven games in the tournament by their measured, tactical approach, managing the speed of play for the majority of the game.</p> <p>I agree that England can do even better if they are going to go all the way but this was arguably the toughest opening game of the tournament, so to end it with three points should not be underestimated. For me, this was also the hardest game of the group. Yes, Japan have reached the final at the last two World Cups but this is a completely different Japan team with very young players and a coach that has one eye on next year\u2019s home Olympics.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/10/womens-world-cup-match-breaks-tv-audience-record\">Women's World Cup match attracts bigger TV audience than cricket</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before the match I was slightly worried that England might look a bit shaky at the back because of the number of changes there had been in the warm-up matches but they looked pretty comfortable apart from Steph Houghton\u2019s mistake for Claire Emslie\u2019s consolation goal. I hope Millie Bright\u2019s injury is not too serious because obviously that would mean another change in the centre of defence but otherwise they were really solid as a unit with the two defensive midfielders in Keira Walsh and Jill Scott in front of them.</p> <p>I think 4-2-3-1 is the formation that best suits England because it makes it easier for the two central midfielders to pick up the opposition\u2019s No 10 and gives Scott the platform to launch counterattacks, a feature that is key in the absence of Jordan Nobbs.</p> <p>We also saw the depth of the squad at Neville\u2019s disposal. Four years ago, someone like Alex Greenwood may not have been experienced enough to step in for Demi Stokes in the opening game of the World Cup, but Greenwood showed she was capable of playing at the same level. Then there are the strikers \u2013 Toni Duggan has been a big player for England for a long time and started on the bench but Ellen White and Beth Mead are just as dangerous. Having them and Jodie Taylor also to come off the bench bodes well because they are all capable of scoring goals at crucial times.</p> <p>But it was Nikita Parris who was the real star of the show. She is in a really rich vein of form and you can tell by her celebration of the goal against Scotland that she is far from afraid about playing on this stage. Nikita has become much more clinical over the last couple of seasons and is the sort of big personality in the team who has that X-factor. She really gets on the nerves of defenders \u2013 you could see how annoyed the Scotland players were when she went down after a tackle or nutmegged them. You need that spiky player in your team to irritate opposition and she could be England\u2019s standout in this World Cup. Hopefully if they can get to six points by winning their next match then Neville can give Nikita a rest as England will be confident of beating Argentina.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3dc431ef9e0884b4e552931cf65212531568b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3dc431ef9e0884b4e552931cf65212531568b0/0_206_3492_2095/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Erin Cuthbert couldn\u2019t provide Scotland with the cutting edge they needed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Erin Cuthbert couldn\u2019t provide Scotland with the cutting edge they needed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, Scotland seemed to struggle to find their attacking rhythm at times and I\u2019m not sure if it was the best tactical decision to have Erin Cuthbert playing out of position as a striker. Moving Cuthbert up front in place of Jane Ross and moving Kim Little further forward didn\u2019t really give Scotland any cutting edge going forward that manager Shelley Kerr probably intended. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see if Ross comes back in for the next match against Japan because Scotland will need to try and have much more attacking force going forward to beat Japan. I believe Scotland are the best team out of the four World Cup debutants and will advance at the very least as one of the best third-place spots.</p> <p>The penalty after 15 minutes really seemed to affect Scotland and that allowed England to take control by drawing possession into the midfield and exploiting space on the wings. It is becoming clear that if the ball hits a player\u2019s hand in the box and the hand is in an unnatural position, a penalty will be given. However, there is a slight grey area in terms of unnatural position because what may seem natural to most defenders is deemed unnatural by referees. The intent of the player to play the ball with her hand is irrelevant if the ball happens to hit the hand/arm outside the \u2018natural\u2019 position of the body.</p> <p>I had a really interesting discussion about VAR with Ariane Hingst, who used to play in defence for Germany, and she recognised that this is something defenders are just going to have to adapt to. When a cross is coming in, defenders should instantly put their hands behind your back. Simple. As much as that is unnatural too and people will say it\u2019s ridiculous, it is an adaptation that defenders will have to do to avoid penalties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/09/lucy-bronze-nikita-parris-england-scotland-world-cup\">Bronze and Parris chemistry too potent for Scotland | Suzanne Wrack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for the rest of the tournament, it\u2019s been a promising start even if I was a little disappointed to see it wasn\u2019t a full house in Nice for England\u2019s game.

      "bodyText": "As World Cup openers go, I thought it was a very assured and mature performance from England considering the anticipation there had been building up to the game against Scotland. Because of the rivalry between the two countries and the familiarity that exists among the players, it was always going to be a tricky hurdle to overcome for Phil Neville\u2019s side and I was impressed by the way they approached the task. England look like they are mentally prepared to play seven games in the tournament by their measured, tactical approach, managing the speed of play for the majority of the game. I agree that England can do even better if they are going to go all the way but this was arguably the toughest opening game of the tournament, so to end it with three points should not be underestimated. For me, this was also the hardest game of the group. Yes, Japan have reached the final at the last two World Cups but this is a completely different Japan team with very young players and a coach that has one eye on next year\u2019s home Olympics. Before the match I was slightly worried that England might look a bit shaky at the back because of the number of changes there had been in the warm-up matches but they looked pretty comfortable apart from Steph Houghton\u2019s mistake for Claire Emslie\u2019s consolation goal. I hope Millie Bright\u2019s injury is not too serious because obviously that would mean another change in the centre of defence but otherwise they were really solid as a unit with the two defensive midfielders in Keira Walsh and Jill Scott in front of them. I think 4-2-3-1 is the formation that best suits England because it makes it easier for the two central midfielders to pick up the opposition\u2019s No 10 and gives Scott the platform to launch counterattacks, a feature that is key in the absence of Jordan Nobbs. We also saw the depth of the squad at Neville\u2019s disposal. Four years ago, someone like Alex Greenwood may not have been experienced enough to step in for Demi Stokes in the opening game of the World Cup, but Greenwood showed she was capable of playing at the same level. Then there are the strikers \u2013 Toni Duggan has been a big player for England for a long time and started on the bench but Ellen White and Beth Mead are just as dangerous. Having them and Jodie Taylor also to come off the bench bodes well because they are all capable of scoring goals at crucial times. But it was Nikita Parris who was the real star of the show. She is in a really rich vein of form and you can tell by her celebration of the goal against Scotland that she is far from afraid about playing on this stage. Nikita has become much more clinical over the last couple of seasons and is the sort of big personality in the team who has that X-factor. She really gets on the nerves of defenders \u2013 you could see how annoyed the Scotland players were when she went down after a tackle or nutmegged them. You need that spiky player in your team to irritate opposition and she could be England\u2019s standout in this World Cup. Hopefully if they can get to six points by winning their next match then Neville can give Nikita a rest as England will be confident of beating Argentina. By contrast, Scotland seemed to struggle to find their attacking rhythm at times and I\u2019m not sure if it was the best tactical decision to have Erin Cuthbert playing out of position as a striker. Moving Cuthbert up front in place of Jane Ross and moving Kim Little further forward didn\u2019t really give Scotland any cutting edge going forward that manager Shelley Kerr probably intended. It will be interesting to see if Ross comes back in for the next match against Japan because Scotland will need to try and have much more attacking force going forward to beat Japan. I believe Scotland are the best team out of the four World Cup debutants and will advance at the very least as one of the best third-place spots. The penalty after 15 minutes really seemed to affect Scotland and that allowed England to take control by drawing possession into the midfield and exploiting space on the wings. It is becoming clear that if the ball hits a player\u2019s hand in the box and the hand is in an unnatural position, a penalty will be given. However, there is a slight grey area in terms of unnatural position because what may seem natural to most defenders is deemed unnatural by referees. The intent of the player to play the ball with her hand is irrelevant if the ball happens to hit the hand/arm outside the \u2018natural\u2019 position of the body. I had a really interesting discussion about VAR with Ariane Hingst, who used to play in defence for Germany, and she recognised that this is something defenders are just going to have to adapt to. When a cross is coming in, defenders should instantly put their hands behind your back. Simple. As much as that is unnatural too and people will say it\u2019s ridiculous, it is an adaptation that defenders will have to do to avoid penalties. As for the rest of the tournament, it\u2019s been a promising start even if I was a little disappointed to see it wasn\u2019t a full house in Nice for England\u2019s game. I remember at Germany 2011 there were full grounds for all the opening games so hopefully that will improve as the tournament progresses. We\u2019ve now seen most of the contenders in action and despite Brazil\u2019s win against Jamaica on Sunday, I think the best South American team in the tournament could actually be Chile. Brazil ended an eight-game losing streak, without Marta, but they still have a long way to go to look like a Brazil team capable of going far in the tournament. But of course it\u2019s Brazil, so they could easily prove me wrong. At this stage, the hosts France look like the team to beat. The only question is about their psychological resilience. They have some of the best players in the world but can they hold it together when it matters most? It will be fascinating to find out.",

      "bodyText": "Ocado is investing \u00a317m in high-tech farming with the aim of growing herbs and other produce alongside its robot-run distribution centres around the world. The online grocery specialist has bought a 58% stake in Jones Food, a \u201cvertical farm\u201d that grows 420 tonnes of basil, parsley and coriander a year in stacked trays under 12km (7.5 miles) of LED lights in a warehouse in Scunthorpe. The grower currently supplies businesses such as sandwich maker Greencore. Duncan Tatton-Brown, finance director of Ocado, said the group could open at least 10 more similar farms within five years. He said it could take less than a year to build a Jones Food facility and the two companies were now considering how Ocado\u2019s expertise in robotics and AI could be used to make Jones Food more efficient. James Lloyd-Jones, chief executive of Jones Food, said the group\u2019s Scunthorpe farm recycled all its water, did not use pesticides and was powered by renewable energy, such as wind turbines and solar panels. Ocado\u2019s \u00a317m investment also includes the formation of a new joint venture \u2013 Infinite Acres \u2013 with US-based vertical farming business 80 Acres and Priva, a Netherlands-based horticultural technology provider, on a four-year project to develop off-the-shelf vertical farming systems that can be sold to retail and other businesses worldwide. The 80 Acres farms, which are based in Ohio, Arkansas, North Carolina and Alabama, are able to grow tomatoes and courgettes as well as leafy salads and herbs, without using pesticides. Tim Steiner, Ocado\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cWe believe that our investments today in vertical farming will allow us to address fundamental consumer concerns on freshness and sustainability and build on new technologies that will revolutionise the way customers access fresh produce. \u201cOur hope ultimately is to co-locate vertical farms within or next to our [distribution centres] and Ocado Zoom\u2019s micro-fulfilment centres so that we can offer the very freshest and most sustainable produce that could be delivered to a customer\u2019s kitchen within an hour of it being picked.\u201d Ocado Zoom is a new one-hour delivery service offering a more limited range of goods, launched earlier this year and being trialled in west London. Only eight people work at the Jones Food facility, where the herbs are grown hydroponically \u2013 getting all the nutrients they need without soil. The plants, the first of which were only grown last year, are not touched by humans from seed to bagging ready for stores. A robot called Frank stacks trays of plants ontoon to towers of shelving while machinery automatically harvests them when ready. Every element inside is monitored to ensure it is clean and primed for growing the herbs quickly. Anyone entering must wear protective clothing including overalls, wellies and hairnets and step through an air shower that blows off any dust. Air is filtered to ensure insects cannot enter. Ocado currently sells Waitrose groceries via its website in the UK and provides distribution for Morrisons\u2019 website. Next year it will swap Waitrose for Marks &amp; Spencer under a \u00a3750m joint venture, raising the prospect of specialist robot farms serving the 134-year-old high street retailer. Ocado has sold its hi-tech robot grocery picking and packing technology around the world to retailers wanting to develop online businesses. In one blockbuster deal it is to build 20 warehouses for US supermarket giant Kroger. It has also struck grocery delivery technology partnerships with Groupe Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and ICA Group in Sweden, creating a ready-made potential market for its robot farms.",

Johnson gave his own rousing address to Tory MPs on Monday evening, telling the right-wing 92 group that he was an election-winner. \u201cI will do for this country what I did for London where we were able to lift the poor and the needy in our society while also sticking up for the wealth creators. If we can restore this basic philosophy we will carry all before us,\u201d he said. Gove had been regarded by many at Westminster as the most formidable challenger to Johnson, whom he knocked out of the Tory leadership race in 2016; but foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt has stolen a march on him in recent days. At his own launch, Hunt was introduced by work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, and defence secretary Penny Mordaunt \u2013 two heavyweight supporters from opposite sides of the Brexit divide. Brexit has dominated the debate in the early stages of the race. Raab, who like Johnson resigned from the cabinet over the issue, has mooted the idea of suspending parliament if MPs try to block a no-deal Brexit in October. Johnson has also insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October, with or without a revised deal with Brussels. But Gove has suggested he would be more flexible, if a delay proved necessary to complete a deal. The health secretary Matt Hancock\u2019s campaign was boosted by the backing of Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington. Hancock\u2019s slogan is \u201clet\u2019s move forward\u201d. Gove was introduced by the Tory rising star Kemi Badenoch, the MP for Saffron Walden, with other prominent supporters, including Nicky Morgan and the education secretary Damian Hinds, looking on from the front row. In a frantic week of campaigning at Westminster, three more candidates \u2013 Andrea Leadsom, Mark Harper and Rory Stewart \u2013 will hold launch events on Tuesday, with Johnson and home secretary Sajid Javid to follow on Wednesday. Javid has struggled to win as many endorsements as Hunt or Gove after his campaign got off to a slow start, but has won the coveted backing of Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson.",

I believe psychiatry is currently overdependent on medication, with prescribing seen as the main \u201ctreatment\u201d intervention for doctors. The therapeutic psychiatry that I trained in during the 1980s has largely disappeared. This is partly a result of continual financial cuts over those 33 years, partly the hegemony of the pharmaceuticals in funding a lot of psychiatric research and debate, and I suspect partly the result of psychiatrists wanting the greater sense of validity prescribing seems to offer.

      "bodyText": "Harriet Williamson writes movingly of her own experience of self-harm (Journal, 6 June), and the social and political implications, following the Lancet study showing one in five young women aged 16-24 have self-harmed. I worked as a child and adolescent psychiatrist for 33 years. I believe psychiatry is currently overdependent on medication, with prescribing seen as the main \u201ctreatment\u201d intervention for doctors. The therapeutic psychiatry that I trained in during the 1980s has largely disappeared. This is partly a result of continual financial cuts over those 33 years, partly the hegemony of the pharmaceuticals in funding a lot of psychiatric research and debate, and I suspect partly the result of psychiatrists wanting the greater sense of validity prescribing seems to offer. We still have a huge emphasis, even though the scientific evidence is at best flimsy, on chemical imbalance and the \u201cbrain\u201d being at the core of what is a mental illness. Poverty, the current obsession with exam results, Instagram, lack of resources in psychiatry, and lack of medical training in how to deal with young people cutting themselves are important.

It must be added that Wilby\u2019s treatment of Tim Hunt\u2019s notorious sexist comments is remarkable for a newspaper committed to gender equity. None of us are perfect. But Michael Arthur is a man of integrity and hallmarks of his leadership have included commitments to increasing equality and diversity, improving the student experience, enhancing a neglected estate and to academic excellence. These values and successes deserved to be recognised.

It is a miracle no one was harmed and it is distressing to us to hear residents were raising safety concerns before the fire, just like we were. \u201cIn the days after the fire, the government promised that no stone would be left unturned in addressing the causes of the fire, ensuring that such a tragedy could never happen again. The survivors and the bereaved were promised justice and we were promised change. However, two years on, the reality is that little has changed and justice seems as far away as ever.\u201d Daffarn cited the amount of unsafe cladding still on hundreds of towers across the country, the failure to reform regulation of social housing, and repeated delays to the public inquiry, saying: \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied.\u201d A group of survivors and bereaved are set to take legal action in US court against companies involved in making the cladding materials on Grenfell, including the US industrial giant Arconic, which made the rainscreen panels, and Celotex, which made the insulation. Celotex said it learned about the legal action on Friday and was \u201cconsidering its position\u201d. Arconic declined to comment. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, told MPs and ministers that survivors and the bereaved had to work \u201cridiculously hard just to get some of your attention, let alone have things change\u201d. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be here,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should be at home trying to rebuild the lives that were taken away from us, coming to terms with this new reality that we were forced into because we were ignored and neglected and lost our loved ones in the most horrific way possible. All we had is promises, promises and promises, broken promises.\u201d In a speech after being challenged by Thompson, Brokenshire said: \u201cTwo years have passed, and I know this has been testing in ways I cannot begin to imagine \u2026 I have to say that your strength and character and dignity has been truly humbling for me to see. \u201cFor too long the people of Grenfell and people across the country have been excluded from conversations about the homes they are living in,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst there has been progress on rehousing, I know there is a lot more to do. We need to continue to challenge ourselves.\u201d John Healey, Labour\u2019s shadow housing secretary, said: \u201cNot enough has been done to get every one of those Grenfell survivors into a new home, to get justice for the Grenfell community, to get all those other blocks with unsafe cladding removed and replaced, and also to get those far-reaching changes to building regulations.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Families whose young children are at risk of developing mental health problems because the parents are struggling face a \u201cshocking\u201d lack of help from the NHS, a report says. The charity Parent Infant Partnership (PIP) UK found that only a handful of health service bodies across the UK had a specialist parent-infant relationship team to help children in households where there was domestic violence, substance misuse or a parent who was mentally ill. It said the absence of dedicated support for such families was \u201ca source of disgrace\u201d. PIP has established there are just 27 specialist teams across more than 200 local NHS bodies in the UK. Local councils believe around 20,000 babies in England alone are in need as a result of risks they face in the parental home. PIP\u2019s report says: \u201cParents-infant teams can transform the life chances of babies, yet the majority of babies live in an area where these services do not exist.\u201d The teams work with parents to help them develop loving, supportive relationships with their offspring at a time when babies are undergoing a vital period of brain development. The Conservative MP Tim Loughton, a former children\u2019s minister, backed the report\u2019s findings and its call for the NHS to instigate an expansion of such teams. \u201cParent-infant relationships are vital for children\u2019s development.

There are no figures for how many children aged two and under have any sort of mental health problem because children that age are too young to be diagnosed with a mental illness.

It\u2019s like when you see baking soda at the store. You think \u2018I don\u2019t need to buy baking soda. I definitely already have baking soda, it\u2019s a staple.\u2019 And then you get home and you\u2019re baking a cake and you\u2019re reaching in the cupboard for baking soda and you realize \u2018Fuck, women still aren\u2019t guaranteed equal rights under the constitution.\u2019\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCBYJZ6QbUI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bCBYJZ6QbUI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Even though the amendment passed the House and Senate, it would need 38 states to ratify it, which has been the cause of the delay. So far, only 37 states have ratified it. There was a deadline in place of 1979, which Congress extended, but the states still had not ratified it.</p> <p>The host then focused his attention on the woman who posed the biggest opposition to the amendment, Phyllis Schlafly. She made outrageous claims against the ERA, like it would outlaw sex-segregated bathrooms. Oliver described her personality as \u201ca pre-internet internet troll\u201d. Schlafly once greeted an audience by thanking her husband for allowing her to be there, to rile up feminists. Oliver joked: \u201cOK, that \u2018thank you\u2019 to Fred is entirely unnecessary for two reasons. One, wives are not property of their husbands. Two, I\u2019m not sure how big a sacrifice it was for Fred to spend a few hours not hanging out with Phyllis Schlafly.\u201d</p> <p>Schlafly was a mouthpiece for the religious right, who said the ERA would be a tool to expand abortion. Oliver clarified the amendment said nothing about abortion or anything else and only says the government cannot disadvantage women or men by gender but it did not stop conservatives from rallying against it.</p> <p>The host then explained to his audience the ERA is needed despite laws on the books that protect against discrimination because laws can be rolled back, citing the Violence Against Women Aact which Congress let expire, and the 20 policy guidelines on Title IX anti-discrimination laws Trump has reversed. \u201cA constitutional amendment like the ERA is more stable because constitutional amendments are safe from Donald Trump, unlike Melania\u2019s hopes and dreams and any American flag he gets close to.\u201d</p> <p>To Oliver, the 14th amendment is not enough. While the amendment does guarantee individuals equal protection under the law and the supreme court often interprets this to mean gender discrimination, Justice Antonin Scalia didn\u2019t think it should be interpreted that way, as he did not want to interpret outside of the written word. Oliver responded, \u201cAs insane as I personally find his philosophy of ruling on cases by jumping inside the long-dead brains of history\u2019s various misogynists and racists, there are a lot of people who think that way and Trump has promised to put more of them on the bench, saying he wants justices \u2018very much in the mold of Justice Scalia\u2019, which I can only hope means dead, but I worry might mean interpreting the constitution without protections for gender.\u201d</p> <p>While the deadline passed decades ago, Congress could possibly change the deadline, and Nevada and Illinois have recently ratified the amendment.

      "bodyText": "John Oliver\u2019s Last Week Tonight on Sunday revolved around the topic of the unpassed equal rights amendment and its importance to gender discrimination. John Oliver opened his monologue by talking about the hardships women have had to face in the United States recently. \u201cIt\u2019s been an especially rough few years in America for women, from abortion bans to the confirmation of a supreme court justice with resting beer face, to the election of a president who thinks of their genitals as handles,\u201d he said. The equal rights amendment, which he thinks would be a step in the right direction for the country, says: \u201cEquality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of sex.\u201d Eighty percent of the country think it\u2019s already in the constitution, but it has not been passed. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those things that\u2019s so obvious you assume we already have it. It\u2019s like when you see baking soda at the store. You think \u2018I don\u2019t need to buy baking soda. I definitely already have baking soda, it\u2019s a staple.\u2019 And then you get home and you\u2019re baking a cake and you\u2019re reaching in the cupboard for baking soda and you realize \u2018Fuck, women still aren\u2019t guaranteed equal rights under the constitution.\u2019\u201d Even though the amendment passed the House and Senate, it would need 38 states to ratify it, which has been the cause of the delay. So far, only 37 states have ratified it. There was a deadline in place of 1979, which Congress extended, but the states still had not ratified it. The host then focused his attention on the woman who posed the biggest opposition to the amendment, Phyllis Schlafly. She made outrageous claims against the ERA, like it would outlaw sex-segregated bathrooms. Oliver described her personality as \u201ca pre-internet internet troll\u201d. Schlafly once greeted an audience by thanking her husband for allowing her to be there, to rile up feminists. Oliver joked: \u201cOK, that \u2018thank you\u2019 to Fred is entirely unnecessary for two reasons. One, wives are not property of their husbands. Two, I\u2019m not sure how big a sacrifice it was for Fred to spend a few hours not hanging out with Phyllis Schlafly.\u201d Schlafly was a mouthpiece for the religious right, who said the ERA would be a tool to expand abortion. Oliver clarified the amendment said nothing about abortion or anything else and only says the government cannot disadvantage women or men by gender but it did not stop conservatives from rallying against it. The host then explained to his audience the ERA is needed despite laws on the books that protect against discrimination because laws can be rolled back, citing the Violence Against Women Aact which Congress let expire, and the 20 policy guidelines on Title IX anti-discrimination laws Trump has reversed. \u201cA constitutional amendment like the ERA is more stable because constitutional amendments are safe from Donald Trump, unlike Melania\u2019s hopes and dreams and any American flag he gets close to.\u201d To Oliver, the 14th amendment is not enough. While the amendment does guarantee individuals equal protection under the law and the supreme court often interprets this to mean gender discrimination, Justice Antonin Scalia didn\u2019t think it should be interpreted that way, as he did not want to interpret outside of the written word. Oliver responded, \u201cAs insane as I personally find his philosophy of ruling on cases by jumping inside the long-dead brains of history\u2019s various misogynists and racists, there are a lot of people who think that way and Trump has promised to put more of them on the bench, saying he wants justices \u2018very much in the mold of Justice Scalia\u2019, which I can only hope means dead, but I worry might mean interpreting the constitution without protections for gender.\u201d While the deadline passed decades ago, Congress could possibly change the deadline, and Nevada and Illinois have recently ratified the amendment. Now,an Arizona legislator said it would make history for the state. Oliver quipped, \u201cLet\u2019s be honest here: that just doesn\u2019t happen much. The most famous part of Arizona is the Grand Canyon, you know, the part of Arizona where there\u2019s notably less of Arizona.\u201d Then he left his desk to plead to each state, individually: \u201cCould it be you, Oklahoma? You could be known for something other than tornadoes and musicals about how great morning is. Which it isn\u2019t by the way. It never is, it\u2019s just like night but unpleasantly brighter.\u201d To Mississippi, after expressing outrage about their flag, he said: \u201cYeah, you could pass the ERA but, let\u2019s be honest, it would be extremely out of character.\u201d When it came to Alabama, he dismissed the state, \u201cIt definitely won\u2019t be you but Virginia, it really could be you, plus you\u2019re the birthplace of Chris Brown, Rick Santorum and Pat Robertson so frankly, you fucking owe America this. \u201cAll I can say is somebody, please do it before Florida because I really do not want to give them credit for this,\u201d he said.",

Only three batsmen were able to limp into double figures, as Onions and Anderson took it in turns to strike, with young Saqib Mahmood scooping up the rest, as he claimed two for eight. The only resistance came from big Ed Barnard, who biffed five fours in his 32.</p> <p>He was the last man out, with Worcestershire dismissed for 98, the second lowest Championship total of the season. The rain arrived shortly afterwards, saving Lancashire\u2019s batsmen from a potentially tricky afternoon. Onions later mused into his beard: \u201cI don\u2019t know how much water this ground can take. It has taken a lot over the last week like every county ground on the circuit.\u201d</p> <p>But the north-east was spared the effects of the buckling jet stream, with <strong>Durham</strong> and <strong>Northamptonshire</strong> playing three full sessions at Chester-le-Street. There a topsy-turvy day started with Durham being reduced to 46 for five, and finished with a jubilant Ben Raine and Brydon Carse taking Durham to the heady heights of 209 for seven, in an unbroken eighth wicket stand of 128.</p> <p>Ben Sanderson whipped through Durham\u2019s top order with a spell of three for 18, as the batsmen followed the somewhat unwise path of leaving the ball.</p> <p>Michael Jones stood bat aloft to the third delivery of the day and was bowled; Cameron Bancroft watched as his off stump disappeared; and then Alex Lees played for the wrong ball, and the right one zipped between bat and pad. When Matt Coles, on loan from Essex, struck with his second ball, Durham were 18 for four. After a later clatter of middle-order wickets, Raine and Carse decided that patience was perhaps the way to go, firmly defending, even against the new ball. With a slice to the boundary just <br>before the close, Raine reached a career best 75, and gave Durham a steaming cup of hope for the morning.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T18:00:37.041Z\">at 7.00pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cfe7fb98f0863265fe9723c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T16:08:32.843Z\">5.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Raine passes fifty, </strong>Durham 156-7.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to hibernate a little now to write a rain-soaked round-up.

      "bodyText": "From soggy Guildford, to sodden Canterbury rain poured, gushed and torrented down, without mercy or cessation, heartlessly washing out four games without any play and curtailing play at New Road for most of the afternoon. There Jimmy Anderson (four for 24) and Graham Onions (four for 55) made the most of their brief window of opportunity and, under the enigmatic gaze of the cathedral, dissected the Worcestershire batting with supreme skill after Lancashire opted to bowl under gloom-graced skies. It was deja-vu for Worcestershire, who suffered a similar fate when the teams last met earlier this season. Only three batsmen were able to limp into double figures, as Onions and Anderson took it in turns to strike, with young Saqib Mahmood scooping up the rest, as he claimed two for eight. The only resistance came from big Ed Barnard, who biffed five fours in his 32. He was the last man out, with Worcestershire dismissed for 98, the second lowest Championship total of the season. The rain arrived shortly afterwards, saving Lancashire\u2019s batsmen from a potentially tricky afternoon. Onions later mused into his beard: \u201cI don\u2019t know how much water this ground can take. It has taken a lot over the last week like every county ground on the circuit.\u201d But the north-east was spared the effects of the buckling jet stream, with Durham and Northamptonshire playing three full sessions at Chester-le-Street. There a topsy-turvy day started with Durham being reduced to 46 for five, and finished with a jubilant Ben Raine and Brydon Carse taking Durham to the heady heights of 209 for seven, in an unbroken eighth wicket stand of 128. Ben Sanderson whipped through Durham\u2019s top order with a spell of three for 18, as the batsmen followed the somewhat unwise path of leaving the ball. Michael Jones stood bat aloft to the third delivery of the day and was bowled; Cameron Bancroft watched as his off stump disappeared; and then Alex Lees played for the wrong ball, and the right one zipped between bat and pad. When Matt Coles, on loan from Essex, struck with his second ball, Durham were 18 for four. After a later clatter of middle-order wickets, Raine and Carse decided that patience was perhaps the way to go, firmly defending, even against the new ball. With a slice to the boundary just before the close, Raine reached a career best 75, and gave Durham a steaming cup of hope for the morning. Raine passes fifty, Durham 156-7. I\u2019m going to hibernate a little now to write a rain-soaked round-up. Time for a brew. An obituary, care of OB Jato. In Affectionate Remembrance of BAILS THAT FALL, which died at the Oval on 9 June 2019, Deeply lamented by a large circle of sorrowing friends and acquaintances R.I.P. Meanwhile, in the gorgeous sunny north east, Durham pass 150 and Ben Raine teeters nervously, 49 not out. Those heavy bails causing havoc at the World Cup. Play abandoned for the day at Worcestershire too. Which leaves Durham v Northamptonshire counting the points, reeling them in. Fifty-three more needed for a batting point Durham. Just saying. Play has been called off for the day at Canterbury as well. Lancashire \u201choping\u201d to start their first innings at New Road, and a rejuvinated Durham going great guns at Chester-le-Street, an eighth-wicket partnership of 59 and counting between Ben Raine (41 not out) and Brydon Carse (17 not out). Durham 140 for seven. We\u2019ve got a no result at Southampton, South Africa v West Indies rained off with a point each, the second game to be rain-ruined in a few days. With rain forecast for the rest of the week, the weather could yet throw a grenade into dame fortune\u2019s box. South Africa remain second bottom of the table and West Indies climb to fifth. Division One Welbeck (day 2): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. NO PLAY POSSIBLE TODAY. Canterbury: Kent v Somerset. NO PLAY POSSIBLE YET, INSPECTION AT 4PM. Guildford: Surrey v Yorkshire. NO PLAY POSSIBLE TODAY. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 123-7 (Sanderson 3-31; Raine 27 not out) v Northamptonshire Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex NO PLAY POSSIBLE TODAY. Worcester: Worcestershire 98 all out (Onions 4-55, Anderson 4-24, Mahmood 2-8; Barnard 32) v Lancashire. RAIN HAS STOPPED PLAY. World Cup South Africa 29-2 v West Indies. RAIN DELAY, INSPECTION NOW. Abhijato Sensarma has big ideas for the Championship winners 2019. There is an off-season in the cricket calendar every year during the formerly CLT20 slot. I had an idea... Couldn\u2019t the winner of Division One of the County Championship play with the winner of the Ranji Trophy? It could be done on a neutral wicket, such as the ones in South Africa or in the Caribbean, which has something for everyone. It could be a three match series, or even a knockout tournament of four-day matches between more champion domestic teams. I get the feeling people will like it! It sounds good! Though from an ecological point of view I think that cricket has to take into account that endless expansion and endless growth and a bigger, yet bigger, carbon footprint is neither right nor possible. Also, Cherry asks, \u201cIs anyone else tempted to put the central heating back on for the first time since April?\u201d A further inspection at four at Canterbury to give the sodden outfield a chance to lighten up a bit. On this day, 19 years ago, that model, and modest, fast bowler Brian Statham died. I never saw him bowl, I wish I had. Durham 106 for seven, read it and weep Worcestershire. Emails on a rainy day; Finbar Anslow has been qwertying in Italy: It\u2019s tipping it down in Milan, if that\u2019s any consolation. In answer to Geoff Wignall, Basil D\u2019Oliveira was my first cricketing hero, when Tom Graveney and Ken Barrington were batting I was somewhat guiltily hoping for a wicket so that Dolly would come in. Always good for a breakthrough with his bowling he came across as the perfect all rounder and I had the privilege of seeing him bat for Ted Dexter\u2019s International Cavaliers at Taunton; caught on the boundary sweeping once too often. Maybe too modest to have stuck in the collective memory as much as others, but definitely one of the top all rounders of the sixties and in a different league to Mr KP. Also, thank you very much to Tom for standing in for me and doing a fab job. There will be pitch inspections at 3pm at Canterbury, and 3.15 at Southampton. No news from Leicester, rain delay at New Road. And Ben Raine and Brydon Carse tiptoe Durham towards three figures (94-7). Oh, my, this is the Tanita Tikaram. \u201cAll God\u2019s children need travelling shoes, Drive your problems from here\u201d Slippers, another pair of socks, a hearty home-knit, a neck-scarf, a cup of coffee as the thaw-out begins. I see Worcester are all out. Lancs? Ah, a rain delay. Which leaves us with one. Durham have hit the heady heights of 86 for seven with double 26s from Liam Trevaskis and Ned Eckersley. Here\u2019s the end of Trevaskis: Suspected that might happen: Eckersley no longer stopping the rot for Durham v Northants. He\u2019s been caught behind off the bowling of Matt Coles for 26 to leave Durham 81/6. But then, oh no, what\u2019s this? Trevaskis goes next ball, c Curran b Buck, for 26. And with that, the resistance has gone. Durham 81/7 and in trouble. In all honesty, attempting to scoop Jimmy Anderson over the keeper\u2019s head when your team are struggling to make three figures in the first innings is bold, but ultimately quite foolhardy. Ed Barnard goes for 32, nicking an attempted leg-side flick behind, leaving Worcestershire all out for 98 in 38.1 overs. Only he, Dell and Leach got into double figures. Liam Trevaskis and Ned Eckersley have stopped the rot for Durham against Northants. Both are poddling along in the 20s, having come to the wicket with their team five down for 46. They\u2019re five down for 76 now, with Matt Coles sending down a series of tight overs. Don\u2019t count on that Worcestershire 100 - Charlie Morris edges Anderson behind for one, leaving them nine down and five short. Having made a merry 18 from 20 balls, Worcestershire\u2019s captain Joe Leach has become Graham Onions\u2019s fourth victim, bowled, which will teach him for clubbing nine off the Lancashire bowler in the over before. Worcestershire are edging towards 100, currently 93 for 8. Travel news for those going to England V India at Edgbaston. The wind has joined the rain inside the Guildford press tent - I\u2019m heading somewhere warm, but will be back with you in twenty minutes for the latest rain report/wicket watch. A post-pradial snaffle for Graham Onions, Worcestershire 72-7, Ed Barnard a lofty 21 not out. It\u2019s been called off for the day at Wellbeck Colliery/Mansfield/Sookholme/Nettleworth* *delete as you please Geoff Wignall has been thinking about KP from his southern European hideaway. My sympathies on the weather, from a rather cool but sunny central Portugal.Are you really convinced about Peterson\u2019s brilliance? I confess I never was. There\u2019s no question that he played some brilliant innings but that isn\u2019t quite the same thing. I recall Bishan Bedi\u2019s comments after his first good look at him (I forget which Test, but KP made a sizeable score I think). They were to the effect that he\u2019d be a (caught and bowled) bunny for a present day Bedi and wouldn\u2019t last much beyond 30 at the top level. His record against left- armers suggests Bedi was right on both counts, albeit KP\u2019s supporters could argue he was denied the opportunity to continue for longer. It\u2019s interesting to compare Pietersen\u2019s career path with that of Basil D\u2019Oliveira if looking for a truly great SA middle order batsman in England\u2019s ranks. Officially 30 &amp; 35 on FC and Test debut, but later admitting to having shaved 3 years, and still averaging over 40 in Tests during a 5 year period before run average inflation - no helmets, arm guards, heavy bats or shortened boundaries plus at least some would have been on uncovered pitches. On top of which, to my eyes at least a far more aesthetically appealing batsman (if not the most athletic figure, despite his earlier soccer prowess as captain of the non- white SA team). Somehow he\u2019s never mentioned in \u2018all time great\u2019 conversations, probably due to his late start and the tyranny of numbers. It\u2019d be interesting to know how many of an age to remember Dolly would rate KP above him. Mes... The umpires have had a cursory inspection of the middle and there will be no play today here at Guildford. Division One Welbeck (day 2): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2. NO PLAY POSSIBLE RAIN. Canterbury: Kent v Somerset. NO PLAY POSSIBLE RAIN. Guildford: Surrey v Yorkshire. NO PLAY POSSIBLE RAIN. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham 61-5 (Sanderson 3-18) v Northamptonshire Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex NO PLAY POSSIBLE RAIN. Worcester: Worcestershire 64-6 (Mahmood 2-8) v Lancashire And to cheer you all up - this is pretty sweet: This isn\u2019t that funny any more. Rain hammering, nay, torrenting on the roof of the press tent. A few hardy souls huddling in the hospitality tents, but even the groundsmen have given up in the middle. At least Worcestershire and Durham are losing wickets in unison, 53 for five at Chester le Street; Sanderson 3-18; 53 for five at New Road, Mahmood 2-3. Also, a plug for these ICC-Cricket Writers\u2019 Club workshops running for aspiring cricket writers during the World Cup. There are still places available at Old Trafford on June 21 and Edgbaston on June 25. Contact @brucetalbot1 for details. I\u2019ve always felt conflicted about KP - a brilliant player, with many faults, and little self-awareness, but perhaps a victim of the dressing-room clique. Anyway, this, from the weekend. Mustn\u2019t forget the Guardian\u2019s podcast either, helmed by Emma John - we think it\u2019s brilliant, hope you do too. And still it rains... Sad of Guildford? This will cheer you up, Surrey\u2019s new podcast, where you can listen to Morne Morkel tell stories of the 2011 World Cup game where the wicketkeeper was asleep after muddling up his antihistamines and sleeping pills. And much more! George Dobell\u2019s thoughts on Warwickshire - he\u2019s usually pretty accurate. And Worcestershire, 28 for four, doing slightly better than Durham, 19 for four. Worcestershire 22 for three - another for Onions and one for Anderson. Come on Worcester, buck up! And it\u2019s raining again here, misery, misery, with the clouds gathering in menacing grey fluff balls across the Downs. There will be no play before lunch at Canterbury. Close your eyes Durham fans. I\u2019ve just done a quick scout about. The rain has stopped, the Hog\u2019s Back is on tap in the beer tent, the bacon barms are ready to order and the super sopper is out and sopping. A quick squeeze of outfield revealed surprisingly springy grass. If, if, there is no-more rain, we might get play after lunch. Play is delayed round the grounds - no play here or at Wellbeck, Canterbury or Grace Road, and the World Cup match has been suspended at Southampton where South Africa are 29 for two in the eighth over. Durham are six for 2 against Northants, but hey, Alex Lees, last week\u2019s centurion is still there. And at New Road, Worcestershire are 19 for one - Daryl Mitchell gone to Onions. Matt Coles is going to Northants on loan.. and play is delayed at Grace Road due to rain. Wherever you are, the rain is heading your way. And I forgot to mention that Sussex v Gloucestershire starts tomorrow. In brief: Welbeck (day 1): Nottinghamshire 162 (Abbott 6-37; Mullaney 45) v Hampshire 93-2 Canterbury: Kent v Somerset Sad times, Marcus Trescothick, 86 runs in eight Championship innings , has been dropped for Azhar Ali. Lewis Gregory is fit after missing four games with a back problem. Kent have signed off-spinner Ollie Rayner on loan from Middlesex, he becomes eligible next week. Sam Billings (shoulder), Calum Haggett (elbow) and Ivan Thomas (knee) are out injured but all-rounder Grant Stewart returns . Guildford: Surrey v Yorkshire Winless Surrey have added Jordan Clark and wicket keeper-batsman Jamie Smith to their squad. Sam Curran (hamstring), Ollie Pope (shoulder) and Conor McKerr (heel) ares till on the physio\u2019s couch, as are second XI players Arun Harinath, Gus Atkinson and Stuart Meaker . Yorkshire\u2019s Gary Ballance is the leading run-scorer in Division One with 603 runs.. Division Two Chester-le-Street: Durham v Northamptonshire Happy Durham are unchanged from last week\u2019s winning side. Matt Salisbury (groin) and batsman Ryan Pringle (shoulder) are still members of the walking wounded. Adam Rossington plays his first game as captain for Northants following Alex Wakely\u2019s decision to step down. Leicester: Leicestershire v Middlesex Leicester seamers Tom Taylor and Ben Mike are still injured Steve Finn and Tom Helm return for Middlesex. Paul Stirling returns from international duty but James Harris is ruled out after breaking his thumb against Sussex last week Worcester: Worcestershire v Lancashire Worcestershire welcome back Josh Dell and Wayne Parnell, following a hamstring injury. Lancashire wicketkeeper Alex Davies might return and James Anderson, rested against Leicestershire last week, should get another run out. From a soggy, soggy Guildford, for Surrey v Yorkshire, where the rain continues to fall and the groundstaff sweep the covers with brooms. The rows of white plastic chairs are unmanned even by die-hards, and lunch will be taken at 12.30. Elsewhere, Championship leaders Somerset go to Kent; Durham, cock-a-hoop from their first win of the season, entertain Northants at Chester-le-Street; Leicester set the table for Middlesex, fresh from not quite holding out against Sussex, and top-of-the-table Lancashire go to lovely New Road. It is day two at the Notts v Hampshire game, where Notts\u2019s season hasn\u2019t got any better. All out for 162, courtesy of Kyle Abbot\u2019s 6-37, with another failure for Joe Clarke. Time for a rest, perhaps. Joe Weatherley (47 not out) lead Hampshire to 93 for two at stumps.",

England\u2019s victory over Scotland in the Women\u2019s World Cup attracted an average audience of 4.6 million viewers to BBC One on Sunday evening. This set a new record for a women\u2019s football match and left the broadcaster hopeful that millions of viewers will continue to tune in as both national teams progress through the tournament. By comparison coverage of England\u2019s matches in the men\u2019s Cricket World Cup has been averaging a mere 550,000 viewers, despite cricket\u2019s status as a traditional British summer sport and the tournament being hosted in the UK. While women\u2019s football is exploding in popularity and benefitting from the BBC\u2019s promotion on its free-to-air channels, live cricket has been mainly confined to Sky Sport\u2019s paid-for packages for the last 14 years, restricting the number of people who can watch. This has revived longrunning concerns that, despite the substantial funding provided by Sky\u2019s investment in the rights to show cricket on television, it is undermining the broad appeal of the sport. England Cricket World Cup viewing figures peaked at the end of last Monday\u2019s showdown with Pakistan, when Sky attracted a combined audience of 1.3 million viewers to the final minutes of its coverage of the match, according to official figures provided by the analysis company overnights.tv. By comparison the England v Scotland women\u2019s football match \u2013 in a sport that has until recently been overlooked by traditional media outlets \u2013 peaked at 6 million viewers on BBC One, with many more watching on online streams, which are not included in the official TV ratings. Live English cricket largely vanished from free-to-fair television screens in the mid-2000s, when high-profile test matches could attract peak audiences of more than 8 million viewers. Legal restrictions mean that public broadcasters can still show highlights packages.

The attackers are believed to belong to the Fulani ethnic group. Violence between Dogon hunters and Fulani herders has resulted in hundreds of deaths since January.

A spokesman for Mali\u2019s security ministry said those responsible for the attack had not yet been identified. The violence between Fulani and rival communities has exacerbated an already poor security situation in Mali\u2019s semi-arid and desert regions, which are used as a base by Islamist extremist groups with ties to al-Qaida and Islamic State. Militants have exploited ethnic rivalries in Mali and its neighbours Burkina Faso and Niger in recent years to win recruits and extend their influence over swaths of territory. On Monday, there were reports of a fresh attack in Burkina Faso. At least 19 people were said to have been killed at Arbinda, close to the border with Mali. In April, more than 60 people were killed near Arbinda in militant attacks followed by intercommunal clashes. One reason for the tensions between communities is the suspicion among some Dogon that the Fulani harbour Islamist extremists \u2013 an accusation denied by the Fulani. Fulanis, who have little access to education or political influence, are frequently scapegoated as jihadis, often with deadly results. Up to 200 people were massacred in Burkina Faso in early January.

      "bodyText": "A children\u2019s nurse who was arrested nearly a year ago on suspicion of murdering eight babies and attempting to kill a further six is now suspected of trying to murder another three infants. Lucy Letby, 29, was initially arrested last July as part of a major police inquiry into the deaths of 17 babies at the Countess of Chester hospital. She was subsequently bailed pending further inquiries. It is understood she was rearrested on Monday on suspicion of murder in relation to the deaths of eight babies and the attempted murder of six babies. She has also been arrested in connection with the attempted murder of three additional babies. DI Paul Hughes, of Cheshire constabulary, who is in charge of the investigation, said the woman \u2013 whom police have not named but is understood to be Letby \u2013 was in police custody helping officers with the case. Police were conducting searches at her home in the Blacon area of Chester on Monday, with a blue forensic tent positioned at the front of the semi-detached property. The investigation is the first major police inquiry into child deaths in UK hospitals in nearly 30 years. It was launched two years ago following an unusually high number of deaths and non-fatal collapses in the Countess of Chester\u2019s neonatal unit. Detectives are investigating the deaths of 17 babies and 16 non-fatal collapses between March 2015 and July 2016. Letby, originally from Hereford, had worked at the hospital for seven years and was training to work with babies in intensive care when she was detained last July. It is understood she was suspended a year earlier and before this she had been removed from clinical duties and placed in an administrative role. In a 2013 interview with the Chester and District Standard newspaper, the nurse said she cared for babies requiring various levels of support. She had worked at the unit as a student nurse during three years of training before qualifying as a children\u2019s nurse at the University of Chester in 2011. Hughes said: \u201cI would like to reassure people that we are doing everything we can as quickly as we can to identify what has led to these baby deaths and collapses.

      "bodyText": "Irene Sutcliffe, who has died aged 94, was a theatre actor who found screen fame in Coronation Street. She arrived on television\u2019s most famous cobbles in 1968 as Maggie Clegg, taking over the corner shop and harbouring two skeletons in her closet. Sutcliffe herself was in awe of performing alongside such famous cast members as Pat Phoenix, Violet Carson and Doris Speed. She recalled: \u201cI remember my heart thumping, waiting for my first entrance outside the shop, and Pat saying: \u2018Oh, you\u2019ll be all right, chuck.\u2019\u201d Just two months into her six-year spell in the soap, it was revealed that Maggie\u2019s husband, Les (played by John Sharp), was an alcoholic. He became increasingly violent, was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and the couple divorced. New love came into Maggie\u2019s life with the arrival of Ron Cooke, a draughtsman and recovering alcoholic.

Here, she plays Mary Louise, the mother of Celeste\u2019s (Nicole Kidman) abusive late husband Perry, who \u2013 unconvinced by the story of an accidental fall off the balcony by her blue-eyed boy \u2013 is now gliding round Monterey like Mrs Danvers in sensible slacks, seeking the truth. Sometimes she is merely viscerally disconcerting; for example, when she bumps into Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) and takes a few casual moments out of her day to note how short she is and how untrustworthy she finds \u201clittle people\u201d to be. Other times she is simply terrifying. Mary Louise\u2019s perfectly paced descent at the family dinner table from platitude (\u201cYour daddy was the most amazing man\u201d) to literally howling rage and grief was worth the price of Streepmission alone.</p> \n<p>Among the rest of the characters/cast it was, for the opening episode at least very much business as usual. Or at least, business as you would expect it after one of your number pushed said abusive husband to his death and the rest of you covered up for her. Madeline (in slight danger of morphing entirely into a grown-up Tracy Flick) is dealing with her post-accomplice-y feelings by becoming ever more frenetically busy and controlling, making it the very worst time for her daughter to reveal that rather than go to college she wants to take up a job offer with a start-up building homes for the poor and vulnerable. Madeline is barely able to pretend even momentarily that this could be incorporated into her life plan.</p> \n<p>Celeste (tall enough not to attract Mary Louise\u2019s ire on height grounds at least) is drifting round the place like a haunted pencil, consumed by guilt for not escaping her marriage before someone was driven to kill for her. Renata (Laura Dern) is still Renata, and we pity the new school teacher who looks as if he is going to be Renata\u2019d to death before half term. Jane (Shailene Woodley) is dancing happily on the beach, the knowledge that the world has been purged of the rapist who fathered her son outweighing her part in that purging. Poor Bonnie (Zo\u00eb Kravitz), however, the one who did the actual pushing/purging, is struggling. She would rather, she tells Maddie, have confessed but Madeline took that choice away from her when she started spinning lies to the police.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8a53d779905cf92e748a5ec93143e1cfa4b5cdc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8a53d779905cf92e748a5ec93143e1cfa4b5cdc/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Business as usual: Shailene Woodley, Zoe Kravitz, Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern in Big Little Lies.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Business as usual: Shailene Woodley, Zo\u00eb Kravitz, Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern in Big Little Lies.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like the first season, it is sensationally slick and beautiful to look at.

      "bodyText": "Warning: this review contains spoilers for season one and season two, episode one of Big Little Lies. Meryl Streep in the new season of Big Little Lies (Sky Atlantic) almost makes me believe in homeopathy. No matter how tiny the performance dosage in a scene or episode, she leaves the whole thing somehow charged with her presence long after she has vanished into the wings. You can believe the very molecules of the air are still humming with her memory. By God there\u2019s something about the woman. Here, she plays Mary Louise, the mother of Celeste\u2019s (Nicole Kidman) abusive late husband Perry, who \u2013 unconvinced by the story of an accidental fall off the balcony by her blue-eyed boy \u2013 is now gliding round Monterey like Mrs Danvers in sensible slacks, seeking the truth. Sometimes she is merely viscerally disconcerting; for example, when she bumps into Madeline (Reese Witherspoon) and takes a few casual moments out of her day to note how short she is and how untrustworthy she finds \u201clittle people\u201d to be. Other times she is simply terrifying. Mary Louise\u2019s perfectly paced descent at the family dinner table from platitude (\u201cYour daddy was the most amazing man\u201d) to literally howling rage and grief was worth the price of Streepmission alone. Among the rest of the characters/cast it was, for the opening episode at least very much business as usual. Or at least, business as you would expect it after one of your number pushed said abusive husband to his death and the rest of you covered up for her. Madeline (in slight danger of morphing entirely into a grown-up Tracy Flick) is dealing with her post-accomplice-y feelings by becoming ever more frenetically busy and controlling, making it the very worst time for her daughter to reveal that rather than go to college she wants to take up a job offer with a start-up building homes for the poor and vulnerable. Madeline is barely able to pretend even momentarily that this could be incorporated into her life plan. Celeste (tall enough not to attract Mary Louise\u2019s ire on height grounds at least) is drifting round the place like a haunted pencil, consumed by guilt for not escaping her marriage before someone was driven to kill for her. Renata (Laura Dern) is still Renata, and we pity the new school teacher who looks as if he is going to be Renata\u2019d to death before half term. Jane (Shailene Woodley) is dancing happily on the beach, the knowledge that the world has been purged of the rapist who fathered her son outweighing her part in that purging. Poor Bonnie (Zo\u00eb Kravitz), however, the one who did the actual pushing/purging, is struggling. She would rather, she tells Maddie, have confessed but Madeline took that choice away from her when she started spinning lies to the police. Like the first season, it is sensationally slick and beautiful to look at. It still has its fun with the insanity of the (self-imposed) demands of modern motherhood, womanhood and the politics of the school gate. This is neatly encapsulated, as the new term begins, in Madeline\u2019s opening explanation of how you have to earn your \u201cgood mom points\u201d all over again, especially if you have become older or fatter over the summer. But it has not lost its underlying focus, which is the complexity and minutiae of women\u2019s lives and how radically they are affected \u2013 whatever the level of surrounding privilege \u2013 by men\u2019s actions. Perry is as present now \u2013 in Celeste\u2019s guilt and rubble-strewn psyche, in Mary Louise\u2019s grief for a monster (though her ability to gaslight Celeste and her friends where necessary suggests where he learned at least some of his skills) and Bonnie\u2019s suffering \u2013 as he was when he was alive. Even Jane\u2019s freedom now throws into relief the circumscription of her life before. In addition, there is also a rather rewarding \u2013 for the viewer at least, less so for the men involved \u2013 relationship developing between Madeline\u2019s ex-husband Nathan and her new one Ed. In an oblique but neat commentary on the sexes\u2019 personal/emotional lives, the women (who have become known locally as \u201cthe Monterey Five\u201d) have each other to call on even in cases of murder, while Nathan (James Tupper) has only Ed (Adam Scott) to call on for advice when he finds himself baffled by Bonnie\u2019s sudden change of mood. And even more concerned by her withdrawal from the marital bed. Still. It is ultimately \u2013 and effortlessly, for this is not a grandstanding or selfish performance, just unavoidably brilliant \u2013 going to be one woman\u2019s show now.

      "body": "<p>The sad clown. The chronic depressive comedian. It is one of the greatest cliches in showbusiness. Patton Oswalt \u2013 ebullient, life-affirming, swearing as he hurtles along the Interstate 10 highway in California \u2013 does not sound like one of those. At least, not any more.</p> <p>Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true-crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in 2016 at the age of 46. That was the second-worst day of Oswalt\u2019s life. The worst was breaking the news to their seven-year-old daughter, Alice, the next day.</p> <p>Three years later, Oswalt, aged 50, is healing. An atheist, he found salvation in single fatherhood. He remarried with no apology to trolls shouting: \u201cToo soon!\u201d His career flourished on stage, TV and film. And he is very excited about a European tour that finishes in London on 15 June.</p> <p>Oswalt \u2013 whose CV includes The King of Queens, Ratatouille, Young Adult, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/veep\" title=\"\">Veep</a> and the upcoming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/23/the-secret-life-of-pets-2-review-family-animation\" title=\"\">The Secret Life of Pets 2</a> \u2013 seems like a man firing on all cylinders. He and McNamara must have been quite a double act, everyone\u2019s favourite dinner conversationalists.</p> <p>McNamara was obsessive about unsolved crimes. She created a website, <a href=\"http://truecrimediary.com/\" title=\"\">True Crime Diary</a>, that covered breaking stories and cold cases, looking for new angles that police had missed. It may sound morbid to some, but not the way Oswalt recalls it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"07433b57f91774892ad5316157d9fceedb013455\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07433b57f91774892ad5316157d9fceedb013455/0_0_2143_2677/801.jpg\" alt=\"Patton Oswalt and his wife Michelle McNamara at the premiere of Young Adult in 2011\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018She definitely put a lot more light back on [the Golden State Killer] case\u2019 ... Oswalt with his wife Michelle McNamara at the premiere of Young Adult in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cShe was just a really deep storyteller, and really good storytelling is about solving problems \u2013 and all of your problems tend to be people,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, with a true crime, especially a cold case, it was almost like the writer and humanitarian sensibility of her was offended that we have all this technology, we have all these clues, we have all this insight: why is this person not caught? And I think that ended up being something that really intrigued her.\u201d</p> <p>McNamara was animated by one whodunnit in particular: more than a dozen murders and at least 50 rapes in California between 1976 and 1986. Some had named the unknown perpetrator the East Area Rapist, others the Original Night Stalker. McNamara coined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/25/golden-state-serial-killer-california-arrest-east-area-rapist\" title=\"\">Golden State Killer</a> and it stuck.</p> <p>She was working on a book about the case, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/21/ill-be-gone-dark-michelle-mcnamara-golden-state-killer-quest\" title=\"\">I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark</a>, at the time of her death. But there were two posthumous postscripts. Using her handwritten notes and thousands of files on her computer, Oswalt ensured the book was finished and published with the help of Paul Haynes, the lead researcher on the case, and Billy Jensen, an investigative journalist. Then, four days after the second anniversary of McNamara\u2019s death, authorities announced that a 72-year-old man named Joseph James DeAngelo <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/25/us/golden-state-killer-serial.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">had been arrested in California</a> after DNA evidence that linked him to the case was taken from <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/golden-state-killer-arrest-search-warrants\" title=\"\">a discarded tissue in his rubbish and </a><a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/skbaer/golden-state-killer-arrest-search-warrants\" title=\"\">the handle of his car door</a>. He has since been charged with offences including <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/golden-state-killer-joseph-deangelo-whats-next-715368/\" title=\"\">13 murders and 13 </a><a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/golden-state-killer-joseph-deangelo-whats-next-715368/\" title=\"\">crimes related to sexual assault</a>.</p> <p>The breakthrough had taken 42 years. Does Oswalt believe that his wife\u2019s work was responsible? \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it,\u201d he says. \u201cPaul Haynes and the other homicide detective said she definitely put a lot more light back on that case and got a lot more interest and resources put back into it. I\u2019m going to say an objectively proven yes on that one.\u201d</p> <p>When DeAngelo was arrested, the feeling was \u201cobviously bittersweet\u201d, Oswalt says. \u201cI would have gone: \u2018Off you go, I\u2019ll take care of Alice. You\u2019ve got work to do.\u2019 But at the same time she would have gone: \u2018I don\u2019t care about credit. I just want to know [the perpetrator is] locked up. That\u2019s all I care about. Both for the victims and just for the basic overall sanity of the reality that we live in, the guy should be rotting in jail.\u2019\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump is terrible for comedians. Doing jokes about him is like trying to shame a shark or a tornado</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>DeAngelo is awaiting trial. \u201cPart of me would like to visit him, but I would only specifically ask him the questions that Michelle outlined at the end of her book. I wouldn\u2019t have any deeper insight to bring to him than Michelle or these investigators did.\u201d</p> <p>The phrase Golden State Killer captures a California paradox: bright sunshine mixed with the pitted noir of Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. Oswalt\u2019s own natural light was dimmed on 21 April 2016 when he found McNamara in their bed, no longer breathing. Paramedics were called and pronounced her dead. An autopsy found she had an undiagnosed heart condition and had taken a mix of prescription drugs, including the amphetamine combination Adderall, the opioid painkiller fentanyl and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax.</p> <p>Full of dread, Oswalt told Alice the next day. \u201cI looked at my daughter and destroyed her world,\u201d he recounted in <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tv/2017/10/19/16502812/patton-oswalt-annihilation-review\" title=\"\">his subsequent stand</a><a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/tv/2017/10/19/16502812/patton-oswalt-annihilation-review\" title=\"\">up show, Annihilation</a>, the second half of which describes the tragedy with searing yet humorous honesty. \u201cI had to look at this little girl that was everything to me and take everything from her.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, in his late 40s, he found himself a widower and a single dad. He admits: \u201cI can say with a pretty good amount of confidence that if I hadn\u2019t had Alice, if I didn\u2019t have a daughter, I think I\u2019d be alive right now, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be functioning very well. Drinking would have been a problem. Binge-eating would have been a problem. And then, I think, old-fashioned, almost Victorian melancholy. I would have merely existed. I would have just eaten to live and then would have drunk so that I didn\u2019t feel anything any more and then would have repeated it every single day. Having Alice was like: \u2018I\u2019ve got to get up, I\u2019ve got to make breakfast, I got to take care of this little life.\u2019 So, it\u2019s almost like I had freedom from choice because I had our daughter.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b40bbbaa2567ccc3565a130ea4ec6a4f967e49e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b40bbbaa2567ccc3565a130ea4ec6a4f967e49e/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph James DeAngelo has been charged with murder and other crimes in relation to the Golden State Killer case\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Part of me would like to visit him, but I would only specifically ask him the questions that Michelle outlined at the end of her book\u2019 ... Oswalt on Joseph James DeAngelo, who has been charged in the Golden State Killer case.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sacramento Bee/TNS/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He continues: \u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t tell you is, when you\u2019re going through grief, every single thing that you do \u2013 no matter how mundane: making breakfast for your daughter, doing laundry \u2013 is part of your healing process, whether you want it to be or not. You are basically rebuilding your psyche, whether it\u2019s in something \u2018elevated\u2019 like writing, or quotidian like paying bills.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cshadow slog\u201d, as he has called it, also included counselling and reading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/11/grief-observed-cs-lewis-review\" title=\"\">A Grief Observed by C</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/aug/11/grief-observed-cs-lewis-review\" title=\"\">S Lewis</a>; the author of The Chronicles of Narnia was also an influential Christian thinker. Not that Oswalt turned to God. Not for a moment. </p> <p>\u201cI wanted to give Alice more hope in the daily waking life than: \u2018Oh, in some far-off make-believe world maybe we\u2019ll see her in the clouds.\u2019 That to me felt insulting to this very inquisitive, very precocious little girl that Michelle had raised to be very sceptical and smart and loving and compassionate. To just go: \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to believe in this fairytale and then just not think about it,\u2019 ... I wouldn\u2019t dismiss her curiosity that way.\u201d</p> <p>Was McNamara\u2019s death a reminder of Oswalt\u2019s own mortality? \u201cI found consolation in stuff Michelle used to say to me because she was a true-crime investigator. One of the phrases she hated was when people go: \u2018Well, everything happens for a reason.\u2019 She\u2019s like: \u2018No, it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s all random. If you want reason, if you want some grace in the world, be kind.\u2019 The only reason and grace we have coming is whatever you put out there.\u201d</p> <p>Oswalt\u2019s mother was a lapsed Catholic, his father \u201ca kind of \u2018meh\u2019 Lutheran\u201d. The fact that McNamara died, rather than Oswalt, only reinforced his view that there is no cosmic conductor.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s say I did believe that this was part of God\u2019s plan. Well, then, what a shitty plan. You\u2019ve got this true-crime investigator, this genius on the trail of these cold cases, and then a guy that tells dick jokes, and you\u2019re going to take one of them and you take the crime investigator? That\u2019s the stupidest thing on the planet.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6f671001a2b4c83486fd815c5c800c1fe553329\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6f671001a2b4c83486fd815c5c800c1fe553329/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patton Oswalt with Timothy Simons in Veep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I feel we\u2019re sounding alarm or despair to a Brit, but you guys have lasted so much longer under way more precarious conditions than we have\u2019 ... Oswalt with Timothy Simons in Veep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In July 2017, Oswalt <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/arts/patton-oswalt-engagement.html\" title=\"\">announced his engagement to </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/arts/patton-oswalt-engagement.html\" title=\"\">the actor Meredith Salenger</a>. The reaction online was divided. Some offered congratulations and expressed delight that he had discovered happiness again. Others suggested he was remarrying with indecent haste. Oswalt gives that societal taboo short shrift.</p> <p>\u201cThe \u2018pushback\u2019 I got was from anonymous people on the internet. With 90% of internet pushback, it\u2019s not anybody actually morally outraged at anything; they\u2019re just bored. One friend of mine got married nine months after his wife passed and everyone gave him shit. Another got married six years after his wife passed and people were like: \u2018You waited too long. This isn\u2019t real.\u2019 So, there\u2019s always going to be people who say: \u2018I like you when you\u2019re mourning because then I\u2019ve got this little lamb that I get to take care of. How dare you move on?\u2019 I feel like I\u2019m only living this life. I don\u2019t owe anyone else anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Virginia-born Oswalt, who is the son of a US Marine and was named after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/22/general-patton-dies-obituary-1945-archive\" title=\"\">the second world war</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/22/general-patton-dies-obituary-1945-archive\" title=\"\"> general George Patton</a>, has been equally pugnacious when talking or tweeting about politics. But unlike garrulous Hollywood types such as John Cusack, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/14/robert-de-niro-warburtons-bread-bagels-tv-ad-commercial\" title=\"\">Robert De Niro</a> and Rob Reiner, he has grown weary of being asked about Donald Trump.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s terrible for comedians,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is the point? He does not give a shit. You can\u2019t do jokes about someone who is not connected to humanity or shame or anything other than immediate, libidinal pleasure. That\u2019s all it is for him. It\u2019s whatever is literally in front of him. It\u2019d be like trying to shame a shark or a tornado. They\u2019re just like: \u2018If it\u2019s in front of me, I\u2019ll eat it; if not, I\u2019ll swim till I see something else to eat.\u201d Shamelessness is Trump\u2019s superpower? \u201cIt kind of is.

      "bodyText": "The sad clown. The chronic depressive comedian. It is one of the greatest cliches in showbusiness. Patton Oswalt \u2013 ebullient, life-affirming, swearing as he hurtles along the Interstate 10 highway in California \u2013 does not sound like one of those. At least, not any more. Oswalt\u2019s wife, the true-crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in 2016 at the age of 46. That was the second-worst day of Oswalt\u2019s life. The worst was breaking the news to their seven-year-old daughter, Alice, the next day. Three years later, Oswalt, aged 50, is healing. An atheist, he found salvation in single fatherhood. He remarried with no apology to trolls shouting: \u201cToo soon!\u201d His career flourished on stage, TV and film. And he is very excited about a European tour that finishes in London on 15 June. Oswalt \u2013 whose CV includes The King of Queens, Ratatouille, Young Adult, Veep and the upcoming The Secret Life of Pets 2 \u2013 seems like a man firing on all cylinders. He and McNamara must have been quite a double act, everyone\u2019s favourite dinner conversationalists. McNamara was obsessive about unsolved crimes. She created a website, True Crime Diary, that covered breaking stories and cold cases, looking for new angles that police had missed. It may sound morbid to some, but not the way Oswalt recalls it. \u201cShe was just a really deep storyteller, and really good storytelling is about solving problems \u2013 and all of your problems tend to be people,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, with a true crime, especially a cold case, it was almost like the writer and humanitarian sensibility of her was offended that we have all this technology, we have all these clues, we have all this insight: why is this person not caught? And I think that ended up being something that really intrigued her.\u201d McNamara was animated by one whodunnit in particular: more than a dozen murders and at least 50 rapes in California between 1976 and 1986. Some had named the unknown perpetrator the East Area Rapist, others the Original Night Stalker. McNamara coined Golden State Killer and it stuck. She was working on a book about the case, I\u2019ll Be Gone in the Dark, at the time of her death. But there were two posthumous postscripts. Using her handwritten notes and thousands of files on her computer, Oswalt ensured the book was finished and published with the help of Paul Haynes, the lead researcher on the case, and Billy Jensen, an investigative journalist. Then, four days after the second anniversary of McNamara\u2019s death, authorities announced that a 72-year-old man named Joseph James DeAngelo had been arrested in California after DNA evidence that linked him to the case was taken from a discarded tissue in his rubbish and the handle of his car door. He has since been charged with offences including 13 murders and 13 crimes related to sexual assault. The breakthrough had taken 42 years. Does Oswalt believe that his wife\u2019s work was responsible? \u201cDon\u2019t take my word for it,\u201d he says. \u201cPaul Haynes and the other homicide detective said she definitely put a lot more light back on that case and got a lot more interest and resources put back into it. I\u2019m going to say an objectively proven yes on that one.\u201d When DeAngelo was arrested, the feeling was \u201cobviously bittersweet\u201d, Oswalt says. \u201cI would have gone: \u2018Off you go, I\u2019ll take care of Alice. You\u2019ve got work to do.\u2019 But at the same time she would have gone: \u2018I don\u2019t care about credit. I just want to know [the perpetrator is] locked up. That\u2019s all I care about. Both for the victims and just for the basic overall sanity of the reality that we live in, the guy should be rotting in jail.\u2019\u201d DeAngelo is awaiting trial. \u201cPart of me would like to visit him, but I would only specifically ask him the questions that Michelle outlined at the end of her book. I wouldn\u2019t have any deeper insight to bring to him than Michelle or these investigators did.\u201d The phrase Golden State Killer captures a California paradox: bright sunshine mixed with the pitted noir of Double Indemnity and Sunset Boulevard. Oswalt\u2019s own natural light was dimmed on 21 April 2016 when he found McNamara in their bed, no longer breathing. Paramedics were called and pronounced her dead. An autopsy found she had an undiagnosed heart condition and had taken a mix of prescription drugs, including the amphetamine combination Adderall, the opioid painkiller fentanyl and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Full of dread, Oswalt told Alice the next day. \u201cI looked at my daughter and destroyed her world,\u201d he recounted in his subsequent standup show, Annihilation, the second half of which describes the tragedy with searing yet humorous honesty. \u201cI had to look at this little girl that was everything to me and take everything from her.\u201d Suddenly, in his late 40s, he found himself a widower and a single dad. He admits: \u201cI can say with a pretty good amount of confidence that if I hadn\u2019t had Alice, if I didn\u2019t have a daughter, I think I\u2019d be alive right now, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d be functioning very well. Drinking would have been a problem. Binge-eating would have been a problem. And then, I think, old-fashioned, almost Victorian melancholy. I would have merely existed. I would have just eaten to live and then would have drunk so that I didn\u2019t feel anything any more and then would have repeated it every single day. Having Alice was like: \u2018I\u2019ve got to get up, I\u2019ve got to make breakfast, I got to take care of this little life.\u2019 So, it\u2019s almost like I had freedom from choice because I had our daughter.\u201d He continues: \u201cThe thing that people don\u2019t tell you is, when you\u2019re going through grief, every single thing that you do \u2013 no matter how mundane: making breakfast for your daughter, doing laundry \u2013 is part of your healing process, whether you want it to be or not. You are basically rebuilding your psyche, whether it\u2019s in something \u2018elevated\u2019 like writing, or quotidian like paying bills.\u201d The \u201cshadow slog\u201d, as he has called it, also included counselling and reading A Grief Observed by CS Lewis; the author of The Chronicles of Narnia was also an influential Christian thinker. Not that Oswalt turned to God. Not for a moment. \u201cI wanted to give Alice more hope in the daily waking life than: \u2018Oh, in some far-off make-believe world maybe we\u2019ll see her in the clouds.\u2019 That to me felt insulting to this very inquisitive, very precocious little girl that Michelle had raised to be very sceptical and smart and loving and compassionate. To just go: \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to believe in this fairytale and then just not think about it,\u2019 ... I wouldn\u2019t dismiss her curiosity that way.\u201d Was McNamara\u2019s death a reminder of Oswalt\u2019s own mortality? \u201cI found consolation in stuff Michelle used to say to me because she was a true-crime investigator. One of the phrases she hated was when people go: \u2018Well, everything happens for a reason.\u2019 She\u2019s like: \u2018No, it doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s all random. If you want reason, if you want some grace in the world, be kind.\u2019 The only reason and grace we have coming is whatever you put out there.\u201d Oswalt\u2019s mother was a lapsed Catholic, his father \u201ca kind of \u2018meh\u2019 Lutheran\u201d. The fact that McNamara died, rather than Oswalt, only reinforced his view that there is no cosmic conductor. \u201cLet\u2019s say I did believe that this was part of God\u2019s plan. Well, then, what a shitty plan. You\u2019ve got this true-crime investigator, this genius on the trail of these cold cases, and then a guy that tells dick jokes, and you\u2019re going to take one of them and you take the crime investigator? That\u2019s the stupidest thing on the planet.\u201d In July 2017, Oswalt announced his engagement to the actor Meredith Salenger. The reaction online was divided. Some offered congratulations and expressed delight that he had discovered happiness again. Others suggested he was remarrying with indecent haste. Oswalt gives that societal taboo short shrift. \u201cThe \u2018pushback\u2019 I got was from anonymous people on the internet. With 90% of internet pushback, it\u2019s not anybody actually morally outraged at anything; they\u2019re just bored. One friend of mine got married nine months after his wife passed and everyone gave him shit. Another got married six years after his wife passed and people were like: \u2018You waited too long. This isn\u2019t real.\u2019 So, there\u2019s always going to be people who say: \u2018I like you when you\u2019re mourning because then I\u2019ve got this little lamb that I get to take care of. How dare you move on?\u2019 I feel like I\u2019m only living this life. I don\u2019t owe anyone else anything else.\u201d Virginia-born Oswalt, who is the son of a US Marine and was named after the second world war general George Patton, has been equally pugnacious when talking or tweeting about politics. But unlike garrulous Hollywood types such as John Cusack, Robert De Niro and Rob Reiner, he has grown weary of being asked about Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s terrible for comedians,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is the point? He does not give a shit. You can\u2019t do jokes about someone who is not connected to humanity or shame or anything other than immediate, libidinal pleasure. That\u2019s all it is for him. It\u2019s whatever is literally in front of him. It\u2019d be like trying to shame a shark or a tornado. They\u2019re just like: \u2018If it\u2019s in front of me, I\u2019ll eat it; if not, I\u2019ll swim till I see something else to eat.\u201d Shamelessness is Trump\u2019s superpower? \u201cIt kind of is. It\u2019s his Green Lantern ring.\u201d Yet Oswalt remains fundamentally optimistic about the future of the country, \u201cif only because I\u2019ve read so much American history and I\u2019ve seen how much closer to the brink we have been as a nation. Also, I feel we\u2019re sounding alarm or despair to a Brit, but you guys have lasted so much longer under way more precarious conditions than we have. You\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, you adorable Americans with your: \u201cOh my God, this is the end of America.\u201d Why don\u2019t you guys take a deep breath and read some British history? We\u2019ve been way closer to disaster than this. So, not to use the old cliche, but Keep Calm and Carry the Fuck On.\u2019\u201d It is a principle that Oswalt applies to his own life. He found love again. His daughter, Alice, is now 10. He is on tour and his screen career is going great guns. The trauma of 2016 is in the rear-view mirror. But it will never be gone. \u201cI don\u2019t think of it as often as I did,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve heard in my grief group: you think of it less and less every day of your life, because that\u2019s how healing works. There are times when a snippet of a song or just a feel in the air will remind me of her. That will always be there. But life forces you to move on whether you want to or not.\u201d Patton Oswalt is at the O2 Forum Kentish Town, London, on 15 June",

      "body": "<p>When Andi Bauer, a German student hiking in Romania, was attacked by a bear, his girlfriend Lara Booth yelled \u201cpunch it in the eye!\u201d (Lara is British, obviously). He did, the bear stopped attacking and Andi was helicoptered to hospital where rods were screwed into his broken leg. He survived, but was punching back the right thing to do? \u201cIf you\u2019re being mauled by a bear, you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do, to escape and survive,\u201d says Levison Wood. A former soldier, explorer and writer (his book for kids, Incredible Journeys, is published this week), Wood once had an encounter in a car park in Yosemite when a bear smashed into the adjacent empty car to get food. \u201cWe woke up and made a lot of noise, as bears do try to avoid humans. But each animal is different; you\u2019ve got to know your stuff.\u201d Here\u2019s his guide to fighting off some of nature\u2019s most-feared beasts.</p> <h2><strong>Crocodiles</strong></h2> <p>Wood knows some stuff about crocodiles, having avoided them while walking the length of the Nile. And that is his advice: avoid them. \u201cIf you go to get water at a place where animals drink, there might be crocodiles there that have been waiting there for days and you might be done for,\u201d he says. \u201cBe a bit clever: go to a less obvious place for water, where they wouldn\u2019t wait for prey.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Hippos</strong></h2> <p>One of the biggest killers in Africa, because they are so fast and very territorial. What should you do? \u201cRun as fast as you can, try to get on to some high ground.\u201d When Wood was chased by a hippo, he scrambled up a hill. \u201cThey\u2019re not good with hills, thankfully.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Snakes</strong></h2> <p>Make noise, says Wood, and they will avoid you. Unless it is a fer-de-lance, or bothrops asper, a nasty pit viper found in Central and South America. \u201cThey\u2019re the only snake to go out of their way to come after you; they\u2019re very territorial.\u201d On a trip in the Panamanian jungle, one went for Wood\u2019s guide, who was, luckily, wearing baggy tracksuit bottoms so the snake\u2019s fangs didn\u2019t get into his flesh. </p> <h2><strong>Big </strong><strong>cats</strong></h2> <p>These will often come at you from behind, says Wood. You could do what they do in parts of Bangladesh, \u201cwhere the local workers wear masks on the back of their heads, to stop leopards and tigers attacking them.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Sharks</strong></h2> <p>One of Wood\u2019s biggest fears, thanks to his grandfather who made him watch Jaws when he was about 10. He has heard that you are supposed to punch them on the nose. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure what state of mind you have to be in to literally get it on the nose.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>In general</strong></h2> <p>Stay calm, act rationally, stick to trails and don\u2019t wander off on your own, as you are much less likely to be attacked if there are more than one of you, he says. Respect the environment you are in. \u201cMost of the animals we\u2019ve spoken about are critically endangered. While the fear is bred into us, remember that they\u2019re the ones that are endangered, we generally come off better than they do.\u201d Yes, Bauer is OK. But what about the poor bear wandering the Carpathian mountains with a sore head?</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Andi Bauer, a German student hiking in Romania, was attacked by a bear, his girlfriend Lara Booth yelled \u201cpunch it in the eye!\u201d (Lara is British, obviously). He did, the bear stopped attacking and Andi was helicoptered to hospital where rods were screwed into his broken leg. He survived, but was punching back the right thing to do? \u201cIf you\u2019re being mauled by a bear, you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do, to escape and survive,\u201d says Levison Wood. A former soldier, explorer and writer (his book for kids, Incredible Journeys, is published this week), Wood once had an encounter in a car park in Yosemite when a bear smashed into the adjacent empty car to get food. \u201cWe woke up and made a lot of noise, as bears do try to avoid humans. But each animal is different; you\u2019ve got to know your stuff.\u201d Here\u2019s his guide to fighting off some of nature\u2019s most-feared beasts. Crocodiles Wood knows some stuff about crocodiles, having avoided them while walking the length of the Nile. And that is his advice: avoid them. \u201cIf you go to get water at a place where animals drink, there might be crocodiles there that have been waiting there for days and you might be done for,\u201d he says. \u201cBe a bit clever: go to a less obvious place for water, where they wouldn\u2019t wait for prey.\u201d Hippos One of the biggest killers in Africa, because they are so fast and very territorial. What should you do? \u201cRun as fast as you can, try to get on to some high ground.\u201d When Wood was chased by a hippo, he scrambled up a hill. \u201cThey\u2019re not good with hills, thankfully.\u201d Snakes Make noise, says Wood, and they will avoid you. Unless it is a fer-de-lance, or bothrops asper, a nasty pit viper found in Central and South America. \u201cThey\u2019re the only snake to go out of their way to come after you; they\u2019re very territorial.\u201d On a trip in the Panamanian jungle, one went for Wood\u2019s guide, who was, luckily, wearing baggy tracksuit bottoms so the snake\u2019s fangs didn\u2019t get into his flesh. Big cats These will often come at you from behind, says Wood. You could do what they do in parts of Bangladesh, \u201cwhere the local workers wear masks on the back of their heads, to stop leopards and tigers attacking them.\u201d Sharks One of Wood\u2019s biggest fears, thanks to his grandfather who made him watch Jaws when he was about 10. He has heard that you are supposed to punch them on the nose. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure what state of mind you have to be in to literally get it on the nose.\u201d In general Stay calm, act rationally, stick to trails and don\u2019t wander off on your own, as you are much less likely to be attacked if there are more than one of you, he says. Respect the environment you are in. \u201cMost of the animals we\u2019ve spoken about are critically endangered. While the fear is bred into us, remember that they\u2019re the ones that are endangered, we generally come off better than they do.\u201d Yes, Bauer is OK. But what about the poor bear wandering the Carpathian mountains with a sore head?",

More specifically, the team looked at 10,000 particular points in the DNA and compared what they saw with such data for hundreds of modern domesticated and wild varieties.</p> <p>Dating of artefacts or organic matter near to the seeds revealed that some of the ancient pips were from the iron age, around 500 BC, while others came from various points within the Roman era and others were from medieval times \u2013 the latest pips were from the early 13th century.</p> <p>The team\u2019s DNA analysis revealed that all 28 of the seeds came from domesticated grapevines rather than wild varieties, with most related to modern western European varieties used for winemaking.</p> <p>Wales said several pieces of evidence suggest that they had indeed been involved in producing a tipple.</p> <p>\u201cMany of these sites have something connected to them related to winemaking or apparent vineyards,\u201d said Wales, adding that the sites where the seeds were found also provided a clue. \u201cOnce you press grapes to make the juice you have to deposit [the seeds]. Often you see in archaeological sites, the easiest place to dump waste is a latrine or a well that is not being used any more.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/23/wine-tasting-junk-science-analysis\">Wine-tasting: it's junk science</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Further work showed that different varieties were sometimes cultivated at one site, while in some cases two or more genetically identical seeds were found in the same soil layer at a site, suggesting the grapes might have grown on the same vine. Intriguingly, a pair of seeds dating to the second century AD and found 600km (370 miles) apart in Alsace and Mediterranean France, also grew on genetically identical plants. \u201cThese genetic clones suggest that Romans transported grapevine across long distances \u2026most likely as cuttings,\u201d the authors write.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really cool for us, where they have the same genetic sequence, but they are separated by hundreds of kilometres,\u201d said Wales. \u201cReally the only way to explain that is that, genetically, they are growing the same vines very far apart.\u201d</p> <p>One seed revealed that vines producing grapes in Orl\u00e9ans around 1050-1200 AD were genetically identical to those that produce savagnin blanc grapes today \u2013 in other words, it seems cuttings of the vines have continuously been made for about 900 years.</p> <p>\u201cBasically it is an identical twin that has just been maintained forever,\u201d said Wales. What\u2019s more, early Roman seeds from a site in Tourbes have a parent-offspring relationship to grapes for savagnin blanc. That, the authors write, could suggest \u201cthat either Savagnin Blanc or its direct relatives have been cultivated in France since the first century [AD].\u201d</p> <p>But whether the ancient wine would have tasted the same as today\u2019s is another matter; as Wales points out, factors including terroir and processing techniques also affect the flavour.</p>",

Scientists say they have discovered vines producing savagnin blanc grapes today are genetically identical to vines grown in Orl\u00e9ans 900 years ago. \u201cIt tells us a lot about the ingenuity of winemakers, so they have been using similar techniques for hundreds of years and they have been keeping alive certain vines that consumers really like,\u201d said Dr Nathan Wales, a co-author of the research from the University of York. Writing in the journal Nature Plants, Wales and colleagues report that they analysed DNA recovered from 28 grape seeds found at nine archaeological sites around France, focusing on the genetic material in the seed that would have come from the vine on which the grapes grew. More specifically, the team looked at 10,000 particular points in the DNA and compared what they saw with such data for hundreds of modern domesticated and wild varieties. Dating of artefacts or organic matter near to the seeds revealed that some of the ancient pips were from the iron age, around 500 BC, while others came from various points within the Roman era and others were from medieval times \u2013 the latest pips were from the early 13th century. The team\u2019s DNA analysis revealed that all 28 of the seeds came from domesticated grapevines rather than wild varieties, with most related to modern western European varieties used for winemaking. Wales said several pieces of evidence suggest that they had indeed been involved in producing a tipple. \u201cMany of these sites have something connected to them related to winemaking or apparent vineyards,\u201d said Wales, adding that the sites where the seeds were found also provided a clue. \u201cOnce you press grapes to make the juice you have to deposit [the seeds]. Often you see in archaeological sites, the easiest place to dump waste is a latrine or a well that is not being used any more.\u201d Further work showed that different varieties were sometimes cultivated at one site, while in some cases two or more genetically identical seeds were found in the same soil layer at a site, suggesting the grapes might have grown on the same vine. Intriguingly, a pair of seeds dating to the second century AD and found 600km (370 miles) apart in Alsace and Mediterranean France, also grew on genetically identical plants. \u201cThese genetic clones suggest that Romans transported grapevine across long distances \u2026most likely as cuttings,\u201d the authors write. \u201cThat was really cool for us, where they have the same genetic sequence, but they are separated by hundreds of kilometres,\u201d said Wales. \u201cReally the only way to explain that is that, genetically, they are growing the same vines very far apart.\u201d One seed revealed that vines producing grapes in Orl\u00e9ans around 1050-1200 AD were genetically identical to those that produce savagnin blanc grapes today \u2013 in other words, it seems cuttings of the vines have continuously been made for about 900 years. \u201cBasically it is an identical twin that has just been maintained forever,\u201d said Wales. What\u2019s more, early Roman seeds from a site in Tourbes have a parent-offspring relationship to grapes for savagnin blanc. That, the authors write, could suggest \u201cthat either Savagnin Blanc or its direct relatives have been cultivated in France since the first century [AD].\u201d But whether the ancient wine would have tasted the same as today\u2019s is another matter; as Wales points out, factors including terroir and processing techniques also affect the flavour.",

      "bodyText": "Tory leadership candidates have been making their formal pitches in advance of the first round of voting, which will take place on Thursday. Jeremy Hunt The foreign secretary launched his campaign on a high after winning the backing of Penny Mordaunt, the defence secretary and a key Brexit supporter. This was his second coup of the week after gaining the support of Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary and leading Tory moderate. He made the case that he was the most serious and experienced would-be leader, in an apparent rebuke to his main rival, Boris Johnson. Hunt, who is becoming the bookies\u2019 second favourite in the race, gave a speech in London, with his wife, Lucia, numerous MPs and other supporters in the audience. Hunt\u2019s pitch was that he would deliver Brexit before allowing a general election, saying the failure to leave the EU had \u201cput our country and our party in grave peril\u201d. \u201cWithout a deal, any prime minister who promised to leave by a certain date would have to call a general election to change the parliamentary arithmetic. And that is an election we would lose badly,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we fight an election before delivering Brexit, we will be annihilated.\u201d Matt Hancock The health secretary said he wanted his campaign to be about a \u201cfront story\u201d, not a backstory, and said the Conservative party was in danger of allowing its obsession with Brexit to stop it focusing on the future. In front of an audience of young entrepreneurs and artists, and standing in front of a window that made him look like a talking silhouette, he likened the Tory leadership contest to politics in the 1840s. \u201cMost politicians were still banging on about the Corn Laws, while the industrial revolution was fundamentally changing the lives of every person in this country,\u201d he said. Hancock, an outsider candidate, suggested those who would take the UK out of the EU with no deal were not confronting the political reality and berated his rivals for suggesting proroguing parliament was an option, saying it was an affront to D-day veterans. \u201cThat goes against everything those men who fought their way up those beaches died for,\u201d he said. He also said the next Tory leader had to be certain of their beliefs in another coded swipe at Johnson. \u201cThe only way you can do the job is if you know your heart \u2013 if you\u2019re honest to yourself and know what you stand for.\u201d Hancock said he was in favour of low taxes and hinted that he could cut corporation tax, but said his priority was to raise the national living wage to two-thirds of average incomes, over \u00a310 an hour, by 2022. He also previewed measures that may be in the government\u2019s social care green paper \u2013 such as insurance for people to protect their homes if they need long-term social care. Dominic Raab The former Brexit secretary has had a rocky start to his campaign after telling broadcasters he was not a feminist and missing out on a slew of endorsements from the Brexiter right of the party, which instead went to Johnson over the weekend. In his speech on Monday morning, Raab offered a take-no-prisoners approach to the Brexit negotiations, promising a tough new stance with Brussels, but refusing to rule out proroguing parliament in order to deliver a no-deal Brexit in October, if no new concessions can be agreed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been humiliated as a country in these talks with the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re divided at home, and demeaned abroad.\u201d He said he still believed the UK could have got a different deal to the backstop if the team had been united. In a dig at Johnson, as well as cabinet members who have resisted leaving with no deal, Raab said Brexit would not be delivered with \u201cbluff and bluster\u201d and said he would only pick a cabinet that was unanimously prepared to deliver no deal. Quoting the Institute for Government, he said it would be \u201cnear-impossible for MPs to stop a prime minister who is determined to leave in this way\u201d. He said he would lead \u201ca buccaneering approach to global free trade\u201d \u2013 a phrase that raised eyebrows \u2013 and said the Conservatives\u2019 priority should be the low-paid, in contrast to Johnson, who has offered sweeping tax cuts to the well-off. Esther McVey The former work and pensions secretary held what her camp billed as an official launch event, a speech to the ultra-Brexit Bruges Group, in Westminster. McVey has also refused to rule out seeking to prorogue parliament to ensure that the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 31 October. She said she could ensure this by not allowing MPs any votes on the departure process before the deadline. During a Q&amp;A after the speech, she said remain-minded MPs had sought to frustrate the UK\u2019s departure under Theresa May: \u201cBut that only happened because the prime minister kept bringing back motions to the floor of the house.

What I am now seeking to do is make sure, as a public servant, we deliver what the public were offered.\u201d Her speech was briefly interrupted when a man took to the podium to yell about the event being \u201cfake news\u201d. He eventually left, and it was not immediately clear what he was angry about. The address contained few new commitments. Most of her main policy ideas, notably a plan to raid the foreign aid budget for \u00a37bn a year to spend on schools and the police, were revealed last month, when she launched her self-styled \u201cblue-collar Conservatism\u201d movement. Michael Gove The environment secretary, whose campaign plan was knocked off course at the weekend by revelations about drug-taking, sought to regain his place as the leading \u201cStop Boris\u201d candidate with a launch peppered with policy pledges. Gove told the event, in a Millbank skyscraper, that he was \u201cin it to win it\u201d. He said his record in office \u2013 as education and justice secretaries under David Cameron, and now as environment secretary under Theresa May \u2013 showed his \u201creforming zeal\u201d and ability to get results. He played up his senior role in the Vote Leave campaign, saying he had \u201cled from the front\u201d because he believed it was \u201cthe right thing to do, at a critical moment in our history\u201d. He repeated his plan for a \u201cfull stop to the backstop\u201d, and reiterated that he would be willing to delay Brexit beyond the next deadline of 31 October if that was what it took to secure a deal. Gove also announced a series of new policies, from a new social insurance to pay for social care to changing human rights law to prevent service personnel being pursued over historical crimes. And he made several digs at the frontrunner and old sparring partner Johnson, including criticising his plans for a tax cut for higher earners. \u201cThe poor must come first,\u201d he said. Mark Harper The most unknown name in the contest, Mark Harper, made his pitch as the only candidate who had not been involved in any of the decisions that had led to the current Brexit crisis. Harper said all of his rivals, including those who had resigned, had \u201csat around the cabinet table and participated in decisions that have led to not leaving the European Union three years after the referendum\u201d. The former chief whip and immigration minister said he would not commit to leaving the EU by October, calling it \u201cnot credible to say you can renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and get it through both Houses of Parliament by 31 October\u201d. However, he suggested he would consider a no-deal Brexit at that point if no changes to the agreement were forthcoming from Brussels. \u201cIf we approach our European Union partners in a spirit of openness, and we bust a gut, we do everything we can to get a deal, and they are simply not prepared to budge, then in those circumstances, and only in those circumstances, do I think there will be a majority in the House of Commons to leave without a deal,\u201d he added. During his launch, Harper was grilled on the hostile environment, including the \u201cGo Home\u201d vans he launched as immigration minister \u2013 a role from which he resigned after his cleaner was found not to have leave to remain in the UK. Harper said he did not \u201cresile from the message\u201d of the vans but said they were \u201cnot successful and we didn\u2019t do it again\u201d. The launch, billed as an \u2018ask me anything\u2019 event, ended with a tongue-in-cheek question about who would win in a fight \u2013 a lion or a bear? \u201cOn the basis that the lion is the symbol of Britain, I\u2019m going to say the lion,\u201d Harper said. Andrea Leadsom The former leader of the House of Commons began her campaign saying she would \u201cnever say never\u201d to the prospect of a second Scottish independence referendum, saying she is a believer in devolution but opposed to a fresh vote in principle. Speaking after her campaign launch on Tuesday morning, she suggested it would not be right for her to issue a blanket ban on any future referendum, even though she was against it. \u201cThe reason I say \u2018never say never\u2019 is because I do not think that there should be another independence referendum in Scotland. I do not think it\u2019s in their interest, but on the other hand, I am a big believer in devolution,\u201d she said. Leadsom said she believed another referendum could be avoided by working to strengthen the union. \u201cWhat I think we have to be doing is promote the strength of the UK working together far stronger, far more than we have done, and I have a number of policy areas that I would use to try and make that happen,\u201d she said. Rory Stewart Rory Stewart had the most unusual launch \u2013 in a circus tent, where he briefly seemed to tell an audience of 600 members of the public that he might be prepared to back a Labour motion to block a no-deal Brexit. Stewart said he was \u201cwholly supportive\u201d of the principle of the motion to remove no deal as an option, even though he had not seen the detail yet. \u201cA no-deal Brexit is not a credible threat,\u201d he added. Pressed on whether the decision would anger his party and lose him the vote, he said: \u201cThere is only one way of resolving this problem and that is through parliament. \u201cThat\u2019s a very, very uncomfortable truth ... But there is not going to be some brand new negotiation with Europe ... The solution has to lie on getting it through parliament.\u201d But he later said he had read the Labour motion and would not be voting for it. Stewart launched his campaign on the South Bank in central London in a packed out, dimly lit cabaret tent adorned in red velvet. Performing with no notes, he left his podium at one moment to stand closer to the crowd. But when asked whether his stellar performance would be swept aside by Boris Johnson, he jibed that he trusted the Tory membership not to make the mistake of backing the frontrunner. \u201cYou speak to people across the country and ask them \u2018do you really \u2013 I don\u2019t want to make this too personal \u2013 feel that this is the person you want engaging with the detail on the future on your health and education system?\u2019 \u201cDo you really feel that this is the person you want writing the instructions to the nuclear submarines? Is this the man you want embodying your nation on the world stage and guiding you through the most difficult choice that Britain has faced for 50 years? I trust the Conservative members to arrive at the correct answer,\u201d he said.",

      "bodyText": "Candidates running in the Conservative leadership contest have launched a low-tax policy drive as they seek to burnish their economic credentials alongside their Brexit stances. In developments that would carry a hefty price tag for the public purse, Tory hopefuls including Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab and Michael Gove have vowed to make tax cuts that would cost more than \u00a360bn a year between them. Stephen Crabb, a former Welsh secretary, said on Monday that the race for No 10 had descended into a tax cut \u201cbidding war\u201d that should not be taken seriously. The proposals come as public services struggle to cope after a decade of austerity and to handle the needs of an ageing society, necessitating more funding from tax and not less. Torsten Bell, the director of the Resolution Foundation thinktank, said: \u201cThey misread the state of the nation\u2019s finances, the state of our public services and the desirability of closing, rather than increasing, the divides in our country.\u201d Here is a selection of some of the leading candidates\u2019 promises. Boris Johnson Tax proposal: Raise higher-rate income tax threshold to \u00a380,000 from \u00a350,000. How much will it cost and what will be the likely impact? Such a step would cut the tax bills of 3 million higher-income workers earning more than \u00a350,000 a year, saving those on \u00a380,000 a year about \u00a33,000 a year in tax.

Recent increases have been faster than pay growth, however. The threshold has remained at \u00a343,430 in Scotland, opening up a gap with the rest of the UK. Johnson\u2019s measure would cost \u00a39.6bn a year, which the former foreign secretary said could be funded from the \u00a326.6bn of \u201cfiscal headroom\u201d set aside by Philip Hammond for either ending austerity or boosting the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The policy would, however, mean more government borrowing, which would tear up the Tories\u2019 deficit reduction targets. Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies was very firm about this on Monday. The \u201cheadroom\u201d is the gap between an arbitrary 2% of GDP deficit target used by Hammond and the current national borrowing level of 1.2%. Raising borrowing back towards 2% of GDP would sink the Tories\u2019 chances of meeting their manifesto pledge to eliminate the deficit entirely by the mid-2020s. Bell said: \u201cThe typical income in this country is \u00a326,400. Only one in seven people will earn enough to get any benefit from this policy \u2013 and the biggest winners are those on the very highest incomes.\u201d Jeremy Hunt Tax proposal: Cut corporation tax from 19% to 12.5%. How much will it cost and what will be the likely impact? This would follow a pattern of successive Tory prime ministers and match Ireland with one of the lowest business tax rates in the world. Britain already has among the lowest corporate tax rates in the developed world, well below the US, even after Donald Trump cut US corporate taxes to 21% from 35%, the largest such cut in US history. The argument in favour of a corporation tax reduction is that companies use the extra cash to invest, employ more staff or increase workers\u2019 wages. But despite cuts in the corporation tax rate in Britain since 2010 from 28%, business investment still lags behind other developed economies and average pay is still down on the pre-financial crisis peak after inflation. Brexit has exacerbated the poor track record. Business investment fell in every quarter of 2018, the worst run since the financial crisis. Corporation tax cuts can also prove costly. Some economists argue cuts could boost revenue if more businesses locate and invest in Britain, others argue that money has been given away at the expense of the exchequer. Hunt\u2019s proposal could cost Britain as much as \u00a313bn, according to the Resolution Foundation. Dominic Raab Tax proposal: Cut basic-rate income tax from 20% to 15%. How much will it cost and what will be the likely impact? More than 25 million Britons pay the basic rate of income tax, which applies on pay above the tax-free allowance of \u00a312,500. Cutting the rate would likely boost the UK economy by giving these people more money to spend. Although such steps could help lower-income households, the change would come with a significant price tag: the Resolution Foundation estimates as much as \u00a332bn. Sajid Javid Tax proposal: Scrap the 45% additional-rate tax band on incomes above \u00a3150,000 How much will it cost and what will be the likely impact? The home secretary argues the cuts would improve the \u201cdynamism\u201d of the economy. Scrapping the higher rate would, however, benefit the top 1% and 2% of taxpayers and would likely come with a cost to the exchequer. Javid has also signalled openness to cutting the basic rate, calling himself a \u201clow-tax person\u201d. After Labour\u2019s Alistair Darling introduced a 50% additional rate to fight a ballooning budget deficit during the financial crisis, George Osborne cut the rate down to 45% in 2012, arguing it would raise more money. Osborne said the move brought in an extra \u00a38bn, although critics said this was distorted by high earners delaying paying tax in order to benefit from the cut. Michael Gove Tax proposal: Replace VAT with a US-style sales tax How much will it cost and what will be the likely impact? In addition to other reforms to business rates and corporation tax proposed by the environment secretary, Gove said his \u201cbusiness knowhow\u201d tax cuts would help to increase investment, productivity and workers\u2019 pay across the country. Brexit could enable the UK to scrap VAT as the system operates under EU rules. But it currently brings in about \u00a3130bn in revenue, or about 18% of all tax receipts, and change to an established regime would not be easy to introduce. The details would also be important, should any new sales tax apply to items that are currently exempt, such as food. More than 160 countries operate VAT systems but the US does not as its sales taxes are set at state level, making it difficult to introduce a nationwide VAT scheme. Gove has also said he could cut or reform business rates to support small businesses and high street retailers. Esther McVey Spending proposal: \u00a37bn for education and police How much will it cost and what will be the likely impact? Rather than offering large tax cuts, the former work and pensions secretary has proposed cutting the overseas aid budget by \u00a37bn, which she would use to increase education funding by \u00a34bn and police funding by \u00a33bn. Like other Brexiters, McVey said she would refuse to pay \u00a339bn to the EU for a deal, which she said could be used to support business, including through cutting tax.

Indeed, the economy shrank by 0.4% m/m in April, the second monthly contraction in a row. This meant that the 3m/3m rate slowed to 0.3% (consensus 0.4%), following Q1\u2019s 0.5% gain. The sectoral breakdown of growth made for pretty discouraging reading too. Construction contracted in April by 0.4% m/m, while services output only managed to stagnate. The surprise was just how sharply manufacturing output plunged. It fell by 3.9% m/m.</p> <p>Admittedly, a couple of temporary factors dragged on growth in April. The first is the unwinding of the stockpiling boost \u2013 which saw firms increasing their stocks in Q1 to protect themselves against a possible no deal Brexit on 29th March. The other is the decision by car manufacturers to bring forward their annual production shutdowns from August to April in case of a no deal, which resulted in a 24% m/m drop in vehicle production \u2013 the biggest monthly fall since records began. Given the sector\u2019s weight in GDP (1.5%), this knocked a chunky 0.2ppts off overall GDP. That will come back in May.</p> <p><strong>However, even without this, then, GDP would have fallen by 0.2% m/m in April. We had thought GDP would rise by 0.2% q/q in Q2 but it\u2019s now possible that GDP won\u2019t rise at all or even contract.</strong></p> <p>Overall, the clear message is that underlying growth is pretty sluggish. With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfe1aed8f084466bb196ee6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-10T08:59:51.497Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jun/10/markets--trade-war-progress-uk-gdp-growth-april-brexit-business-live?page=with:block-5cfe151c8f0895eae9513b78#block-5cfe151c8f0895eae9513b78\">The slide in growth in April</a> shows that Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK economy, says Alessandro Capuano of Fineco Bank:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After a resilient start to the year fuelled by Brexit stockpiling efforts, maintaining that momentum is proving to be a challenge.</p> <p>Last week we saw the first red signs following gloomy reports on the manufacturing and construction industries.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap The UK economy has posted its weakest monthly growth figures in three years, as a \u2018Brexit hangover\u2019 hits demand. UK GDP shrank by 0.4% in April, rather worse than economists expected, dragging the rolling three-month growth rate down to 0.3%. The decline was due to a 3.9% contraction across manufacturing, the worst decline since 2002, as UK car producers implemented planned shutdowns in case Britain had crashed down of the European Union at the end of March. Car manufacturing slumped by 24%, while transport output suffered its biggest monthly fall since 1974. Rob Kent-Smith of the Office for National Statistics blamed car shutdowns and the unwinding of some Brexit stockpiling: \u201cGDP growth showed some weakening across the latest 3 months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns. \u201cThere was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date has faded.\u201d The construction sector also had a bad month, down 0.4%, while service sector was flat. Economists fear that the UK economy will continue to struggle. The NIESR thinktank\u2019s GDP tracker suggests it\u2019s on track to shrink by 0.2% in the second quarter of this year. April\u2019s contraction follows a 0.1% drop in GDP in March. John McDonnell MP, Shadow Chancellor, warns that the economy is weakening while government MPs focus on the race to succeed Theresa May. \u201cThe whole country is hurting while the Tory leadership candidates compete on tax cuts for high earners. \u201cWith GDP going backwards over two consecutive months, this government is resembling a business entering administration. \u201cWages, investment and productivity are all stagnant \u2013 and only Labour\u2019s plan for a \u00a310 per hour Real Living Wage, National Transformation Fund and regional industrial strategy will deliver the sustainable growth we need to turn this ailing economy around.\u201d Wall Street has shrugged off Donald Trump\u2019s new threat to impose tariffs on Mexico. Stocks are rising in early trading, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up by 163 points to 26,147. That\u2019s its highest level in a month, on relief that Mexican imports into America won\u2019t face new levies from today. As well as Brexit, the UK economy has been weighted down by recent trade tensions, with America and China\u2019s tit-for-tat tariffs dampening global growth. So... UK bosses (particularly manufacturers) won\u2019t be pleased to hear that Donald Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on Mexico, just a couple of days after suspending this threat. Trump has tweeted that a secret agreement has been agreed with Mexico to curb migration at the US border - and Mexico\u2019s parliament had better pass it, or else.... It confirms Trump\u2019s relish for using trade policy to tackle other political issues, which adds uncertainty to the global economy. Economist Josie Dent of the CEBR thinktank fears that the unwinding of Brexit stockpiling will weigh on growth for some time: Today\u2019s data paints a sobering picture. Unless the economy makes a significant comeback, we are likely to see negative growth in the three months to May. However, early indicators suggest that this is unlikely, as manufactures are using up goods they stockpiled in the first three months of the year instead of producing new ones\u201d She also reckons the economy will only grow by around 0.1% in the second quarter of the year (April-June), a little more optimistic than NIESR. Ouch! NIESR, the think tank, has warned that the UK economy may shrink by 0.2% in the current quarter. That would put Britain half-way into a Brexit-induced recession. NIESR fears that there hasn\u2019t been a \u201cmeaningful\u201d recovery in May, following the 0.4% drop in GDP in April revealed this morning. So if manufacturing and construction keep shrinking, the overall economy could contract this quarter -- having grown by 0.5% in January-March. Garry Young, head of macroeconomic modelling and forecasting, said \u201cThe UK economy is on course to contract by 0.2% in the second quarter. The latest GDP data were weaker than expected, partly reflecting shifts in production around the original Brexit departure date, including a 24% fall in car manufacturing. The underlying picture is also quite weak, with Brexit-related uncertainty at home and trade tensions abroad dragging on investment spending and economic growth\u201d. Here\u2019s my colleague Richard Partington on April\u2019s UK GDP report: The British economy shrank in April amid a dramatic decline in car production ahead of the original Brexit deadline, according to official figures. According to the Office for National Statistics, gross domestic product (GDP) plunged by 0.4% in April from a month earlier as factories across the country launched a wave of planned shutdowns to avoid any disruption that could have been unleashed by a no-deal Brexit. Britain\u2019s manufacturers planned around leaving the EU on 29 March as Theresa May took the country to the brink of leaving without a deal, before agreeing an extension until 12 April and then delaying the process until the end of October. She then agreed to stand down as prime minister, triggering the Conservative leadership contest. While economic growth had strengthened as factories rushed to stockpile materials ahead of the deadline, the latest snapshot from the economy shows that production slumped after the target date passed..... More here: GDP measures all the economic activity in an economy (or at least it tries to). But it doesn\u2019t measure more important things -- quality of life, happiness, and mental health. Last week, New Zealand tried to amend this flaw by using wellbeing as a key measure when setting budgets. Dan Button, senior researcher at the New Economics Foundation, argues that Britain should do the same. He writes: The focus on GDP masks what\u2019s really going on. The economy described by the growth figures released this morning does not reflect the reality for most people, who do not feel the effect of rising GDP on their daily lives. GDP can continue to grow while wages stagnate, housing remains unaffordable, life expectancy stalls and the planet heats up. Growth in GDP isn\u2019t spread evenly: the UK is right at the top of the league table of regional inequality, with a huge proportion of the country\u2019s economic activity concentrated in London and the south-east. More here: Britain\u2019s April downturn shows that the public should get a final say on Brexit, argues Labour MP Wes Streeting. Streeting, who supports the People\u2019s Vote campaign, says: Brexit is already causing serious and lasting harm to our economy. News that the economy contracted in April shows the seriousness of the crisis and the extremely high stakes for jobs, investment and public services. British industry is feeling the strain, with British steel and car manufacturing on the brink. And the threat of a destructive No Deal now hangs over every decision facing businesses small and large across the country. They know that WTO terms are the worst trading terms in the world and that No Deal threatens a new economic crisis. \u201cNow we know the real costs of Brexit, the public must be allowed back into this process. Forcing No Deal \u2013 for which there is no mandate \u2013 on the country is not a solution. And nor is it a solution to run down the clock with fruitless attempts at renegotiation of Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal. \u201cThe only way to deliver a stable and lasting settlement, and to give businesses and workers the certainty they need, is through a People\u2019s Vote.\u201d Although manufacturing slumped by almost 4% in April, it actually grew in the February-April quarter. That suggests factories were racing to stockpile goods and fulfil orders before the end of March, in case they lost access to European markets, only to relapse panting for air in April after the Brexit extension was agreed. Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit agrees that Brexit hurt the UK economy in April: The Independent\u2019s Ben Chapman points out that today\u2019s GDP report is much worse than economists expected: The UK economy shrank 0.4 per cent in April as the Brexit paralysis took hold following the proposed deadline for departure from the EU. The latest monthly fall was four times larger than analysts had forecast and marked the second consecutive month of contraction for the UK\u2019s economy after a 0.1 per cent drop in March. Stockpiling of goods to deal with a disorderly Brexit on 29 March slowed down after deadline day was moved back to 31 October. Gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the earlier months of this year had been boosted as manufacturers in particular built up supplies. As that effect wore off, industrial production declined by 2.7 per cent in April compared to March while manufacturing slumped by 3.9 per cent - the sharpest drop since June 2002. The slide in UK manufacturing in April shows the dangers of Brexit uncertainty, warns TUC General Secretary Frances O\u2019Grady: \u201cIndustry is paying the price for the government\u2019s Brexit chaos. \u201cThis is the biggest decline in car production since 1974. With plants like Ford Bridgend already closing, it\u2019s time to get serious about the scale of the threat facing our economy. \u201cPoliticians must do whatever it takes to stop a bad deal or a no-deal Brexit.\u201d Reuters has spotted that UK transport production fell at its fastest rate in over 40 years in April, as car plants held their annual shutdowns early. Output from Britain\u2019s car-making sector slumped by 24% in April, the ONS says. That\u2019s because bosses took the decision to move planned shutdowns to April, in case the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal at the end of March. This wiped 13% off transport production, dragging overall manufacturing down by nearly 4% -- the worst since June 2002. Economist Rupert Seggins argues that the slowdown in Britain\u2019s service sector (which makes up three-quarters of the economy) is more serious than the slump in manufacturing. Yael Selfin, Chief Economist at KPMG UK, fears that the UK faces many more months o weak growth: \u201cThe hangover that\u2019s followed the UK\u2019s original exit date is proving stronger than anticipated. Today\u2019s figures signal the UK economy is likely to experience more subdued growth for the rest of the year, marred by Brexit uncertainty. \u201cThe significant drop in car manufacturing, and in broader manufacturing activity at the start of Q2, point at more than just a reversal of the stock building effect seen as businesses prepared for an expected Brexit in March. \u201cWhile services saw a slight improvement in April, continued weakness of financial services and the hospitality sector do not bode well for the overall prospects for the economy this year.\u201d Ruth Gregory of Capital Economics fears that the UK economy could stall, or even shrink, in the current quarter. She says the contraction in April shows that the \u201cBrexit hangover\u201d was bigger than feared, telling clients: The deluge of activity data suggested that the economy got off to a bad start in Q2. Indeed, the economy shrank by 0.4% m/m in April, the second monthly contraction in a row. This meant that the 3m/3m rate slowed to 0.3% (consensus 0.4%), following Q1\u2019s 0.5% gain. The sectoral breakdown of growth made for pretty discouraging reading too. Construction contracted in April by 0.4% m/m, while services output only managed to stagnate. The surprise was just how sharply manufacturing output plunged. It fell by 3.9% m/m. Admittedly, a couple of temporary factors dragged on growth in April. The first is the unwinding of the stockpiling boost \u2013 which saw firms increasing their stocks in Q1 to protect themselves against a possible no deal Brexit on 29th March. The other is the decision by car manufacturers to bring forward their annual production shutdowns from August to April in case of a no deal, which resulted in a 24% m/m drop in vehicle production \u2013 the biggest monthly fall since records began. Given the sector\u2019s weight in GDP (1.5%), this knocked a chunky 0.2ppts off overall GDP. That will come back in May. However, even without this, then, GDP would have fallen by 0.2% m/m in April. We had thought GDP would rise by 0.2% q/q in Q2 but it\u2019s now possible that GDP won\u2019t rise at all or even contract. Overall, the clear message is that underlying growth is pretty sluggish. With the Brexit paralysis and a slowing global economy taking its toll, we doubt GDP will grow by much more than 1.5% or so in 2019 as a whole and expect interest rates to remain on hold until the middle of next year. The slide in growth in April shows that Brexit uncertainty is hurting the UK economy, says Alessandro Capuano of Fineco Bank: After a resilient start to the year fuelled by Brexit stockpiling efforts, maintaining that momentum is proving to be a challenge. Last week we saw the first red signs following gloomy reports on the manufacturing and construction industries. Following a positive first-quarter mainly driven by an increase in inventory build-up, Q2 2019 is proving to be rather disappointing. Here\u2019s some expert reaction to the news that Britain\u2019s economy stumbled in April: Monthly GDP figures can be erratic, so it\u2019s sensible to look at the quarterly growth figures too. They show that the UK economy grew by 0.3% over the February-April period (despite contracting in both March and April). That\u2019s down from 0.5% growth in January-March, suggesting that the economy struggled as the Brexit crisis intensified this spring. The ONS\u2019s head of GDP, Rob Kent-Smith, has confirmed that the UK economy suffered from car plant shutdowns in April. He also points out that factories slowed their stockpiling activities, after the UK\u2019s Brexit date was pushed back to 31 October. Kent-Smith says: \u201cGDP growth showed some weakening across the latest 3 months, with the economy shrinking in the month of April mainly due to a dramatic fall in car production, with uncertainty ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date leading to planned shutdowns. \u201cThere was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date has faded.\u201d Britain\u2019s services sector stagnated in April, with no growth at all. The construction industry also had a bad month, with output down 0.4%. UK manufacturing suffered a sharp contraction in April, today\u2019s GDP report shows. Industrial production declined by 2.7% during the month, with manufacturing shrinking by an alarming 3.9%. This appears to be due to UK car plants shutting down in April, as manufacturers prepared for a no-deal Brexit which never came. BREAKING: Britain\u2019s economy shrank by 0.4% in April, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show. That\u2019s its biggest monthly fall since March 2016, and follows a 0.1% contraction on March. More to follow! The US stock market is expected to follow Asia and Europe higher. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 110 points in the futures market (actual trading begins in five hours). Relief that America won\u2019t impose new levies on Mexican imports is pulsing away, even though there\u2019s some confusion over what\u2019s exactly been agreed. Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank explains: Markets are blowing small celebratory bubbles this morning as late on Friday the US announced a deal with Mexico to ensure that tariffs don\u2019t get imposed today as planned. However there was some subsequent confusion as Mr Trump tweeted that Mexico has agreed to buy \u201clarge\u201d amounts of agricultural products from the US as part of the deal. This didn\u2019t seem to be anywhere in the accord released and sources close to the negotiations suggested on Bloomberg that there weren\u2019t any additional side deals planned. So a bit puzzling but there will be relief that the tariffs have been avoided and perhaps some might believe it shows Trump\u2019s propensity to strike deals after brinkmanship. Holiday news: troubled tour operator Thomas Cook has confirmed that it\u2019s in talks with China\u2019s Fosun, its largest shareholder. Fosun is interested in buying Thomas Cook\u2019s tour operator business. A sale would provide the company with much-needed capital. More here: This morning\u2019s optimism doesn\u2019t extend to Neil Woodford. Shares in Woodford\u2019s publicly-traded fund, Woodford Patient Capital Trust, have hit a fresh record low this morning, down another 5% below 60p for the first time. That\u2019s despite an attempt this morning to reassure the City. In a brief and breezy statement (somewhat lacking in details), WPCT said it was \u201cpleased with the operational progress of its portfolio companies\u201d, and \u201cclosely monitoring the situation\u201d at Woodford Investment Management. This is WPCT\u2019s first public comment since another Woodfood fund, Equity Income, slammed the door to prevent investors getting out. A week on, Woodford\u2019s strategy -- and his links with financial platform Hargreaves Lansdown - are under major scrutiny. As the Sunday Times pointed out - Woodford investors have lost money, and paid fees for the privilege: Hargreaves Lansdown shares have dropped 2% this morning, to a two-month low. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 has hit a five-week high in early trading. The blue-chip index has gained 40 points to 7,370, its highest level since early May. Mining companies are among the top risers, with Antofagasta, Anglo American and BHP Group all up around 1.5%. They\u2019re all vulnerable to trade war worries, as weaker economic growth hits commodity prices. European stock markets have all begun the week strongly. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says the US-Mexico deal is giving stocks a lift: It\u2019s a sea of green as stocks rebound on Trump\u2019s Mexican fix. Investors are relieved at Mexico and the US coming to an agreement to avoid the latter slapping the former with tariffs, and this sent equity futures north. But, he\u2019s also worried about the precedent of threatening a trade war to change immigration policies. Could the White House try the same trick with Europe, to force NATO members to spend more?... This may only embolden Mr Trump to use tariffs as policy tool for the pursuit of non-economic interests. As previously suggested, the EU could be next \u2013 maybe to get the 2% defence spending target. Commodity prices are also rallying this morning, after the US stepped back from hitting Mexico with new tariffs. The copper price has gained 0.6% to $5,831 per tonne, having fallen for the last eight weeks in a row. Nickel (1.3%) and lead (+1.2%) are also higher this morning. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. It\u2019s tipping it down in London this morning, but that\u2019s not dampening the optimistic mood in the City, and across the global markets. Shares have jumped in Asia today after the US stepped back from launching a trade war with Mexico. Donald Trump\u2019s surprise change of heart means Mexican imports won\u2019t face 5% tariffs from today, a move that would have further escalated America\u2019s trade dispute with other economies. Trump\u2019s threat to use economic tariffs to tackle a political problems (migration at the US border) had worried the markets -- what other issues could the US try to solve by threatening trade war? Under the agreement, Mexico will immediately expand a border program that sends migrants seeking asylum in the US back to Mexico while they await adjudication, deploy more security officers to contain the flow of migrants headed to the US, and crack down on human smuggling, the declaration said. There\u2019s obvious relief that a deal\u2019s been reached -- even though several of Mexico\u2019s \u201cconcessions\u201d on asylum seekers were apparently agreed months ago. As Elsa Lignos of RBC Capital Markets puts it: The biggest weekend news was Trump\u2019s Friday night tweet (and a formal joint US-MX statement) announcing an agreement which suspends Trump\u2019s tariffs threat on Mexico for now. Reading through the details, Mexico basically re-committed to existing promises (and maintained its own red line of rejecting safe third-country status) \u2013 aka Trump blinked. The reaction in Asia has been positive. Talk of blinking won\u2019t please the president, though - he wants more credit! Investors aren\u2019t bothered about the president\u2019s legacy though. Japan\u2019s Nikkei index has jumped 1.2%, as a wave of buying swept Asian trading floors. China\u2019s CSI 300 index has gained 1%, with similar gains in Australia and South Korea too. The big question, though, is whether Trump is also prepared to cut a deal with Beijing, so he can notch up another \u2018win\u2019 ahead of next year\u2019s reelection race. Hopes of a breakthrough at this month\u2019s G20 leader\u2019s meeting could push European shares higher today. The FTSE 100 index is expected to jump 40 points to 7368, adding to Friday\u2019s rally. Hopes of an early US interest rate cut following Friday\u2019s weak US jobs report are also keeping traders optimistic (although, if we get a trade war deal, there\u2019s less need to cut borrowing costs to support the economy....) Also coming up today The latest GDP figures will show how Britain\u2019s economy performed in April, after the threat of a disorderly exit from the EU was delayed until October. Economists fear a small contraction (-0.1%), as the boost from Brexit stockpiling faded. We also get new UK trade data.

This is a makeover show that operates from a standpoint of total empathy. During every episode, layers are peeled off, truths are uncovered and tears are shed. All the Queer Eye men are hopepunk figureheads. Even Antoni.</p> <h2>Dating Around</h2> <p>Dating shows have a tendency to become gussied-up meat markets, but Dating Around is rare in that it rewards human connections. If a contestant acts with any entitled self-interest, they are roundly condemned.</p> <h2><strong>Santa Clarita Diet</strong></h2> <p>A series about a flesh-eating zombie may not sound particularly hopepunk, but dig past the gory premise and you are confronted with an endlessly optimistic sitcom about a couple who are able to work through their differences with love and patience.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d240c68cc6a090377a7d4d263c9734cd1544cfb0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d240c68cc6a090377a7d4d263c9734cd1544cfb0/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parks and Recreation \u2026 interconnected aspiration.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parks and Recreation \u2026 interconnected aspiration.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Parks and Recreation</strong></h2> <p>The first series of Parks and Recreation was a disaster because none of the characters seemed to like one another.

Based on the assumption that we are living in mercilessly dystopian times, it is a genre that offers a softer alternative for fraught millennials: optimism delivered as powerfully as possible through acts of kindness and \u201cconsciously chosen gentleness\u201d. It is generally considered the opposite of \u201cgrimdark\u201d, which is also a thing.

Having shaped his narrative, Patterson lets the story speak for itself and it is the reader who will feel outrage, disbelief, hilarity as she works through the novel. Children of Ruins by Adrian Tchaikovsky has pleased SackTheJuggler: [It] is the sequel to Children of Time, which was (some spoilers) a story about a spider civilisation, accidentally created, and what happens when they come into contact with their inadvertent human creators. The book (so far) has a similar structure as the earlier one, with separate storylines which will presumably unite at the end.

Enjoyable \u201csense of wonder\u201d SF.

Interesting links about books and reading Writers are more productive when they cluster. Erica Eisen on Samizdat: \u201cI imagine the book\u2019s maker sitting bent over their desk, carefully redoing each full stop, comma, accent and h\u00e1\u010dek one by one, for the benefit of future readers they would never meet.\u201d The Tale of Genji\u2014what is it?

Why am I not understood?\u201d</p> <p>Some of her fans might not be ready to accompany the Russian ballerina on her odyssey into experimental dance, but Osipova is an artist who trusts her instincts: from her 2001 decision to walk out of one of the world\u2019s most prestigious ballet companies, the Bolshoi, in favour of a second-tier institution, the Mikhailovsky Theatre, to launching a parallel career in contemporary dance while still one of the top classical ballerinas.</p> <p>Now a principal with the Royal Ballet, and boasting a nonstop freelance schedule on the side, Osipova is a powerful dancer of explosive jumps and dramatic intensity.

Last year, in her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/sep/14/natalia-osipova-pure-dance-review\">self-curated programme Pure Dance</a>, she and Kittelberger performed Roy Assaf\u2019s Six Years Later, a portrait of a tired and tetchy relationship, in which, the noted New York Times critic Siobhan Burke, Kittelberger emerged as an equal to the charismatic Osipova on stage.</p> <p>Dancing with Kittelberger was a revelation for Osipova. \u201cIt was so, so different to dancing with a classical dancer,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like a real person, really touching me, and it was like, \u2018Mmmm!\u2019\u201d Her bright eyes widen with mischief at the memory. \u201cIt was electrifying. He really showed me a different way of experiencing dance.\u201d</p> <p>Gerry Fox, who filmed the couple dancing in the studio, talks about their \u201csensual tension, two people giving their all through their bodies and being so free with each other\u201d. Osipova has danced with many notable partners, including former boyfriends Ivan Vasiliev and Sergei Polunin, but this was different. \u201cSo different,\u201d she says. The film sees them working on a new creation, I\u2019m Fine, about the ups and downs of a relationship. \u201cThe title comes from me personally, when I\u2019m irritated or angry \u2013 saying \u2018I\u2019m fine!\u2019 when it\u2019s clear I\u2019m not.\u201d Kittelberger created the steps (\u201cThat\u2019s not my strong point\u201d) and Osipova was dramaturg. \u201cI\u2019m more sensitive to the story,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m strong on interpretation. That\u2019s the gift I have.\u201d</p> <p>Kittelberger provides Osipova with essential support off stage as well as on. \u201cIf I\u2019m in an intense project, I become more needy,\u201d she says. \u201cI need more comfort, and if I don\u2019t get it I become resentful.

But there are times when you want to totally give it away and be helpless, and he\u2019s somebody who can allow me to do that.\u201d</p> <p>As well as exploring her adventures in contemporary dance, Fox\u2019s documentary discusses one of Osipova\u2019s most feted classical roles: Giselle, the beautiful young peasant girl who falls for a deceitful nobleman. \u201cGiselle,\u201d Osipova tells the camera at one point, \u201cit\u2019s me.\u201d What did she mean? \u201cIt\u2019s the most natural part for me,\u201d she says. \u201cThe second act is so close to me, as if I have it somewhere in my DNA.\u201d</p> <p>Osipova is not the ghostly spirit of a wronged woman, as Giselle becomes in act two, but her entire physicality alters as she embodies the role \u2013 a more vivid, chilling and unhuman Giselle than any I\u2019ve seen. \u201cWhen I started dancing it, I was 19 or 20, and I was doing it in a very non-traditional way. My teachers would be telling me off, but I had such an inner certainty that it was impossible to knock it out of me.\u201d Where does that confidence come from? \u201cFrom my deep connection to the part \u2013 and my peaceful certainty that this is how it should be.\u201d</p> <p>When Osipova began her career at the Bolshoi, the director was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/may/07/alexei-ratmansky-shostakovich-trilogy-sadlers-wells-choreographer-san-francisco-ballet\">Alexei Ratmansky</a>, \u201cwho gave quite a lot of freedom\u201d. But when he was succeeded by Sergei Filin, Osipova found herself unhappy in Moscow, her opportunities restricted. She\u2019s content now at the Royal Ballet, a company with a healthier culture than most she has experienced. \u201cThe first time I came I was surprised there was no intrigue or conflict, and people were nice to each other,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s my fifth season now and I\u2019ve had not a single conflict. Sometimes people say I just don\u2019t get enough of the language to know!\u201d She laughs. \u201cBut in other companies, you can sense it, when people are envious, or don\u2019t want you to be there, or they\u2019re talking behind your back. I can\u2019t work like that.\u201d</p> <p>Does something about the nature of ballet companies engender a dysfunctional atmosphere? Filin was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2016/jan/04/bolshoi-babylon-film-ballet-acid-attacks-sergei-filin-russia\">the victim of an acid attack</a> orchestrated by a disgruntled dancer, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/new-york-city-ballet\">New York City Ballet</a> has been rocked by accusations of harassment and abuse. \u201cIt all depends on who is leading, and what they encourage and what they cut off,\u201d says Osipova. \u201cI can think of two situations when [Royal Ballet director] Kevin O\u2019Hare said, \u2018This is not happening\u2019, otherwise something unpleasant might have started.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/338257245\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/338257245?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/338257245\">Watch the trailer for Force of Nature Natalia on Vimeo</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The pressure, the egos, the intensity of a dancer\u2019s life have certainly been blamed for more than one artistic outburst.

Why does she think he is so frequently self-destructive? \u201cNo one but him can answer your question,\u201d she says. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly gifted, and I really wish that he nurtures it rather than undermines it.\u201d</p> <p>Osipova seems able to harness all the drama and drive for her dancing and thinks she has another five years of performing at her peak. \u201cAt the moment, I feel very mature and capable, emotionally and physically,\u201d she says. \u201cContemporary dance is making my body feel and move differently.

Now a principal with the Royal Ballet, and boasting a nonstop freelance schedule on the side, Osipova is a powerful dancer of explosive jumps and dramatic intensity. Her passion and self-belief give the title to Force of Nature Natalia, a new documentary by director Gerry Fox that follows Osipova as she rehearses for three shows: La Bayad\u00e8re at the Royal Ballet; The Mother, Arthur Pita\u2019s dark retelling of the Hans Christian Andersen story; and a new duet created with dancer and Osipova\u2019s fiance Jason Kittelberger, more of whom later. We meet at her flat in Little Venice, London \u2013 smart modern decor and the feel of someone who\u2019s not home much \u2013 where we are joined by an interpreter and two over-excited dogs. Osipova, 33, is very straightforward, not starry or effusive \u2013 unlike when she gets on stage, when she\u2019ll propel herself towards dramatic extremes.

The BBC has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who can provide evidence that they claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/may/08/labour-attempts-to-stop-tories-jeopardising-over-75s-free-tv-licences\">Labour attempts to stop Tories jeopardising over-75s' free TV licences</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, up to 1.3 million families who are entitled to receive pension credit do not claim the benefit, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/757268/income-related-benefits-estimates-of-take-up-2016-17.pdf\">according to official government figures</a>, suggesting many poor households will be hit hard by the change.</p> <p>Charities including Age UK have said some elderly viewers will be pushed into relative poverty by the decision, with concerns over whether older viewers will be able or willing to prove they are receiving benefits. It is also likely to result in the criminal prosecution of elderly Britons who do not or are not able to pay.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a massive hardship for millions of people,\u201d said Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. \u201cThe really vulnerable won\u2019t apply for this benefit \u2013 the disabled and lone females do not apply for benefits. And that will be true for this as well.\u201d</p> <p>The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/nov/10/4\">was introduced in 1999</a> by the then Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government, which paid the BBC to provide the service.</p> <p>However, in 2015 the Conservative government, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\">shoulder the cost</a> of free TV licences.</p> <p>The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers.</p> <p>A consultation was launched at the end of 2018, with the BBC arguing that many over-75s were increasingly wealthy and it could not afford the cost of providing them with a service for free.</p> <p>The corporation argued that the \u00a3745m annual cost of maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies. The BBC estimates that the new proposal will cost it \u00a3250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures.</p> <p>The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the decision to means test the free TV licence would protects those most in need, adding: \u201cThis has not been an easy decision. Whilst we know that pensioner incomes have improved since 2000, we also know that for some the TV licence is a lot of money.</p> <p>\u201cI believe we have reached the fairest judgment after weighing up all the different arguments. It would not be right simply to abolish all free licences. Equally it would not be right to maintain it in perpetuity given the very profound impact that would have on many BBC services.\u201d</p> <p>Hall also said the licence fee settlement should never again be agreed in secret. He said: \u201cThe last two settlements have been made in the dark and without proper consultation. It is vital that future decisions are evidence-based and made after proper consultation and scrutiny. We need to find a better way.\u201d</p> <p>The BBC is battling to maintain its main source of funding while also remaining relevant to younger viewers.

      "bodyText": "The BBC has confirmed plans to make most over-75s pay the TV licence fee, arguing that it is the only way to avoid closing channels and making substantial cutbacks. Millions of households will have to start paying \u00a3154.50 a year from June 2020 for the right to watch live television and access the BBC\u2019s iPlayer service. Research from the House of Commons Library found that 3 million households would lose their free TV licence as a result of the decision. The BBC has said it will continue to provide TV licences to over-75s who can provide evidence that they claim pension credit, a means-tested benefit designed to help older people. However, up to 1.3 million families who are entitled to receive pension credit do not claim the benefit, according to official government figures, suggesting many poor households will be hit hard by the change. Charities including Age UK have said some elderly viewers will be pushed into relative poverty by the decision, with concerns over whether older viewers will be able or willing to prove they are receiving benefits. It is also likely to result in the criminal prosecution of elderly Britons who do not or are not able to pay. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive hardship for millions of people,\u201d said Claire Enders of Enders Analysis. \u201cThe really vulnerable won\u2019t apply for this benefit \u2013 the disabled and lone females do not apply for benefits. And that will be true for this as well.\u201d The policy of free TV licences for the over-75s was introduced in 1999 by the then Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, with the cost met by the government, which paid the BBC to provide the service. However, in 2015 the Conservative government, guided by George Osborne, struck a deal under which the subsidy would be phased out by 2020, with the broadcaster having to shoulder the cost of free TV licences. The government later gave the BBC responsibility for deciding what to do about the benefit, meaning any unpopular decisions on charging over-75s had to be made by the BBC rather than ministers. A consultation was launched at the end of 2018, with the BBC arguing that many over-75s were increasingly wealthy and it could not afford the cost of providing them with a service for free. The corporation argued that the \u00a3745m annual cost of maintaining the status quo would have taken up a fifth of its budget, equal to the total amount it spends on all of BBC Two, BBC Three, BBC Four, the BBC News channel, CBBC and CBeebies. The BBC estimates that the new proposal will cost it \u00a3250m a year, requiring some cuts but no channel closures. The BBC director general, Tony Hall, said the decision to means test the free TV licence would protects those most in need, adding: \u201cThis has not been an easy decision. Whilst we know that pensioner incomes have improved since 2000, we also know that for some the TV licence is a lot of money. \u201cI believe we have reached the fairest judgment after weighing up all the different arguments. It would not be right simply to abolish all free licences. Equally it would not be right to maintain it in perpetuity given the very profound impact that would have on many BBC services.\u201d Hall also said the licence fee settlement should never again be agreed in secret. He said: \u201cThe last two settlements have been made in the dark and without proper consultation. It is vital that future decisions are evidence-based and made after proper consultation and scrutiny. We need to find a better way.\u201d The BBC is battling to maintain its main source of funding while also remaining relevant to younger viewers. The average age of a BBC One viewer is now 60-plus, meaning many people who consume the broadcaster\u2019s content are currently viewing it for free. Both the 2015 and 2017 Conservative manifestos pledged to maintain free TV licences for the over-75s, although the party has since dismissed the latter pledge as a mistake. The BBC decided to announce the change on a day when multiple Conservative leadership candidates formally launched their campaigns, turning the issue into a potential issue in the leadership race, as hopefuls compete for the votes of older Tory party members. The shadow culture secretary, Tom Watson, said he would continue to fight the decision, drawing comparisons with Boris Johnson\u2019s proposed tax cuts for high earners. He said: \u201cYou cannot means test for social isolation. You cannot means test for loneliness. Millions of elderly and isolated people will lose because of this announcement \u2013 Labour will fight it with everything we\u2019ve got.\u201d",

Macron, on a state visit to the US at the time, tweeted that the sapling would be \u201ca reminder \u2026 of these ties that bind us\u201d and the \u201ctenacity of the friendship\u201d of the two nations. From little acorns, great transatlantic ties would take root and grow, was the message. Now, just as symbolically with relations strained between the two, the oak tree has reportedly died. Le Monde reported its demise last week as the two presidents met in Caen for the 75th anniversary of the D-day landings, saying it was a \u201cmetaphor for a relationship that isn\u2019t what it was\u201d. The presidents have deep disagreements on the climate crisis \u2013 Trump pulled the US out of the 2015 Paris climate accord \u2013 as well as on Iran, on the role of the EU and on trade, to name the most consequent. The sapling came from Belleau Wood, north-east of Paris, the location of a ferocious but pivotal battle in which 1,811 Americans died in June 1918 during the first world war. Macron and Trump, wielding gold-coloured spades, shovelled dirt around it, watched by the first ladies Brigitte Macron and Melania Trump and the world\u2019s press during the April 2018 state visit. Even at the time, the auspices were not good: jokes quickly spread on social media that Macron was trolling Trump over his environmental policies. Once the cameras had departed, the tree was uprooted and placed into quarantine to avoid the spread of non-native diseases and invasive insects. G\u00e9rard Araud, the then French ambassador to the US, explained the quarantine was \u201cmandatory for any living organism imported into America\u201d and said the tree would be replanted later.

The console will push positively ludicrous numbers of pixels, enabling 8K resolution \u2013 that\u2019s 7680 \u00d7 4320 pixels, and, despite the name, roughly four times the resolution of a 4K screen \u2013 at 120 frames per second.

      "bodyText": "There still isn\u2019t much that\u2019s clear about Project Scarlett, Microsoft\u2019s follow-up to the Xbox One, which was revealed for the first time at the E3 conference in Los Angeles on 9 June. But we do have some answers. We know a collection of technical specs: the new console will include a custom CPU, based on the Zen 2 architecture created by AMD, a well as GDDR6 Ram, a fast new standard of internal memory, and even an SSD for internal storage, the first time a traditional console has moved from the cheaper spinning disc platters of the PS4 and Xbox One. We know some of what that means for players. The console will push positively ludicrous numbers of pixels, enabling 8K resolution \u2013 that\u2019s 7680 \u00d7 4320 pixels, and, despite the name, roughly four times the resolution of a 4K screen \u2013 at 120 frames per second. It also supports high-end graphics features such as ray-tracing for the first time, bringing ultra-realistic lighting effects to home consoles. More prosaically, the combination of the SSD, CPU and memory should slash loading times, promising an end to staring at slowly filling progress bars.

      "bodyText": "A senior huntsman has been found guilty of animal cruelty and given a 16-week suspended jail sentence after activists secretly filmed him apparently preparing to throw fox cubs to a pack of baying hounds. Animal rights campaigners claim the conviction is significant because it shows a master of hounds \u201cblooding\u201d the animals \u2013 training them to kill foxes \u2013 15 years after the ban on hunting with dogs was introduced. The footage was obtained by members of a group called HIT (the Hunt Investigation Team), who say they include ex-services personnel who have had training in covert investigative methods. They obtained evidence for the prosecution by fixing a tracking device to the vehicle of a man they believed to have connections to the South Herefordshire Hunt and mapping his movements out into the wilds, where they suspected he was catching fox cubs. The activists also set up cameras at the hunt\u2019s kennels and obtained footage that showed the then master of hounds, Paul Oliver, taking fox cubs into the kennels. Though the footage does not show what happened inside the kennels complex, the prosecution at Birmingham magistrates court claimed he was blooding the hounds. Oliver, 40, and kennel maid Hannah Rose, 30, both of Spalding, Lincolnshire, were found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to fox cubs. Joanna Dickens, the district judge, convicted Oliver of four counts of animal cruelty and Rose of three counts of the same charge. The pair and two others who pleaded guilty were due to be sentenced later on Monday. The Masters of Foxhounds Association suspended the South Herefordshire Hunt after the footage emerged and it has disbanded. A spokesperson for the association said Oliver\u2019s actions were \u201ccompletely disgraceful\u201d and had no place in hunting. \u201cIt is incumbent on everybody involved in hunting to see that this sort of behaviour never happens again.\u201d It insisted that it was an isolated incident. HIT said it began investigating after a tipoff. In March 2016, activists put a tracking device on to the Land Rover of a man said to be connected to the hunt and followed his movements. The group said it believed it was permissible in law to put a tracking device on a vehicle it suspected of involvement.

      "body": "<p>The early days of assisted reproduction were fraught with controversy, as media commentators and religious figures denigrated its practitioners for playing God or interfering with nature.</p> <p>Louise Brown, the world\u2019s first baby to be conceived through in vitro fertilisation (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/12/story-ivf-five-million-babies\" title=\"\">IVF</a>), arrived in 1978. By 2018, eight million babies worldwide had been born using IVF or related techniques. The rapid acceptance of the concept was largely due to the pioneering work of gynaecologists such as Ian Craft, who, along with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/10/robert-edwards\" title=\"\">Robert Edwards</a> and Patrick Steptoe (who treated Brown\u2019s mother), gave infertile couples hope that they need not accept their childless state.</p> <p>Craft, who has died aged 81, was an innovative surgeon who achieved a number of firsts. His clinics saw the first successful birth of IVF twins in Europe in 1982, and Britain\u2019s first triplets in 1984; he oversaw the first birth through transferring eggs and sperm to the uterus (1982), and later the first in Britain using gamete intrafallopian transfer, or GIFT (1986).</p> <p>He also achieved Europe\u2019s first birth using a donor egg (1987), and the first using a frozen donor embryo (1990); and in the early 1990s he was the first in the country granted a licence to create embryos using direct injection of the sperm into the egg (intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI). He developed treatment with combinations of hormones and drugs that increased the number and quality of eggs that could be collected per cycle, also increasing the likelihood of successful births.</p> <p>His clinic was lined with photos of blissful couples holding babies, and in pursuit of that end result he pushed boundaries harder than most. In the late 80s he caused an outcry for using eggs from donors known to the prospective parents, something that is now common practice.</p> <p>His was one of very few clinics to offer treatment with donor eggs to post-menopausal women, arguing that as long as they were fit and healthy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/29/health.healthandwellbeing1\" title=\"\">there was no reason why they should not</a> become mothers. They included Liz Buttle, the hill farmer from Wales who in 1997 gave birth to a son at 60 (though she had claimed to be 49 when she approached Craft). There was no subterfuge in the case of Lynn Bezant, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/may/27/tonythompson.theobserver\" title=\"\">56 when she gave birth</a> to twins in 2001 after treatment with donor eggs.</p> <p>When Craft began to practise as an IVF specialist, the field was entirely unregulated. But in Britain after 1984 the careful deliberations of the committee of inquiry into human fertilisation and embryology, chaired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/21/lady-warnock-obituary\" title=\"\">Mary Warnock</a>, brought all such procedures under licensing by what became the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.</p> <p>Craft was something of a thorn in the side of the HFEA, speaking out against restricting the number of embryos implanted (to reduce the risk of multiple births), about time limits on the storage of frozen embryos, and about age limits on treatment.</p> <p>But he vehemently <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/pioneer-in-the-laboratory-of-life-fertility-specialist-ian-craft-prefers-making-miracles-to-1458916.html\" title=\"\">resisted</a> the label of \u201cmaverick\u201d and he and his colleagues meticulously documented his widely adopted innovations in academic journals on reproductive health. Reproductive specialists who trained under him have gone on to head fertility clinics across the world.</p> <p>Craft was born in Wanstead, east London, one of three sons of Reginald Craft, a Barclays Bank employee, and his wife, Lois (nee Logan), who also worked in the bank before her marriage. He grew up in Woodford, attending first St Mary\u2019s Convent there and later Dame Alice Owen\u2019s school for boys in Islington.</p> <p>A teacher encouraged him to pursue a career in medicine and he underwent his initial training at Westminster medical school. He opted to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology: he always claimed to be driven by a desire to make people happy, and saw helping women to give birth as the best means of doing so.</p> <p>Following posts at Westminster, Kingston and Queen Charlotte\u2019s hospitals, he was appointed professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Royal Free hospital in 1976. Under his care Europe\u2019s first test tube twins were born to Jo and Stuart Smith in 1982.</p> <p>The same year he moved to the Cromwell hospital and set up a dedicated assisted conception facility before transferring to the private sector in 1985, establishing fertility treatment at the Wellington hospital. For the final 20 years of his career he operated his own private clinic in Harley Street, the London Fertility Centre; he also helped to establish the Dubai Gynaecology and Fertility Centre.</p> <p>Garrulous, optimistic and boundlessly enthusiastic, he was hands-on in his approach, meeting couples and implanting embryos as one of the centre\u2019s clinical team. In 2000 he fulfilled a long-held wish to become a country gentleman, buying a 125-acre estate with a Georgian mansion and working farm in north Devon, which he set about restoring with his customary energy while still directing the centre.</p> <p>The project was far from complete when he fell seriously ill in 2009, and he spent the rest of his life in a care home. He was well enough, however, to continue pursuing his love of Promenade concerts, live opera and theatre, and of cricket, rugby and football.</p> <p>Craft married his childhood sweetheart, Jackie Symmons, in 1959. He credited her with giving him the confidence to embark on his career, and acknowledged that the intense pace of his working life left her largely responsible for the upbringing of their children. The couple divorced in the late 90s.</p> <p>They had two sons, Simon and Adrian, who survive him.</p> <p>\u2022 Ian Logan Craft, gynaecologist, born 11 July 1937; died 3 June 2019</p>",

      "bodyText": "The early days of assisted reproduction were fraught with controversy, as media commentators and religious figures denigrated its practitioners for playing God or interfering with nature. Louise Brown, the world\u2019s first baby to be conceived through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), arrived in 1978. By 2018, eight million babies worldwide had been born using IVF or related techniques. The rapid acceptance of the concept was largely due to the pioneering work of gynaecologists such as Ian Craft, who, along with Robert Edwards and Patrick Steptoe (who treated Brown\u2019s mother), gave infertile couples hope that they need not accept their childless state. Craft, who has died aged 81, was an innovative surgeon who achieved a number of firsts. His clinics saw the first successful birth of IVF twins in Europe in 1982, and Britain\u2019s first triplets in 1984; he oversaw the first birth through transferring eggs and sperm to the uterus (1982), and later the first in Britain using gamete intrafallopian transfer, or GIFT (1986). He also achieved Europe\u2019s first birth using a donor egg (1987), and the first using a frozen donor embryo (1990); and in the early 1990s he was the first in the country granted a licence to create embryos using direct injection of the sperm into the egg (intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI). He developed treatment with combinations of hormones and drugs that increased the number and quality of eggs that could be collected per cycle, also increasing the likelihood of successful births. His clinic was lined with photos of blissful couples holding babies, and in pursuit of that end result he pushed boundaries harder than most. In the late 80s he caused an outcry for using eggs from donors known to the prospective parents, something that is now common practice. His was one of very few clinics to offer treatment with donor eggs to post-menopausal women, arguing that as long as they were fit and healthy there was no reason why they should not become mothers. They included Liz Buttle, the hill farmer from Wales who in 1997 gave birth to a son at 60 (though she had claimed to be 49 when she approached Craft). There was no subterfuge in the case of Lynn Bezant, who was 56 when she gave birth to twins in 2001 after treatment with donor eggs. When Craft began to practise as an IVF specialist, the field was entirely unregulated. But in Britain after 1984 the careful deliberations of the committee of inquiry into human fertilisation and embryology, chaired by Mary Warnock, brought all such procedures under licensing by what became the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Craft was something of a thorn in the side of the HFEA, speaking out against restricting the number of embryos implanted (to reduce the risk of multiple births), about time limits on the storage of frozen embryos, and about age limits on treatment. But he vehemently resisted the label of \u201cmaverick\u201d and he and his colleagues meticulously documented his widely adopted innovations in academic journals on reproductive health. Reproductive specialists who trained under him have gone on to head fertility clinics across the world. Craft was born in Wanstead, east London, one of three sons of Reginald Craft, a Barclays Bank employee, and his wife, Lois (nee Logan), who also worked in the bank before her marriage. He grew up in Woodford, attending first St Mary\u2019s Convent there and later Dame Alice Owen\u2019s school for boys in Islington. A teacher encouraged him to pursue a career in medicine and he underwent his initial training at Westminster medical school. He opted to specialise in obstetrics and gynaecology: he always claimed to be driven by a desire to make people happy, and saw helping women to give birth as the best means of doing so. Following posts at Westminster, Kingston and Queen Charlotte\u2019s hospitals, he was appointed professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Royal Free hospital in 1976. Under his care Europe\u2019s first test tube twins were born to Jo and Stuart Smith in 1982. The same year he moved to the Cromwell hospital and set up a dedicated assisted conception facility before transferring to the private sector in 1985, establishing fertility treatment at the Wellington hospital. For the final 20 years of his career he operated his own private clinic in Harley Street, the London Fertility Centre; he also helped to establish the Dubai Gynaecology and Fertility Centre. Garrulous, optimistic and boundlessly enthusiastic, he was hands-on in his approach, meeting couples and implanting embryos as one of the centre\u2019s clinical team. In 2000 he fulfilled a long-held wish to become a country gentleman, buying a 125-acre estate with a Georgian mansion and working farm in north Devon, which he set about restoring with his customary energy while still directing the centre. The project was far from complete when he fell seriously ill in 2009, and he spent the rest of his life in a care home. He was well enough, however, to continue pursuing his love of Promenade concerts, live opera and theatre, and of cricket, rugby and football. Craft married his childhood sweetheart, Jackie Symmons, in 1959. He credited her with giving him the confidence to embark on his career, and acknowledged that the intense pace of his working life left her largely responsible for the upbringing of their children. The couple divorced in the late 90s. They had two sons, Simon and Adrian, who survive him. \u2022 Ian Logan Craft, gynaecologist, born 11 July 1937; died 3 June 2019",

McIlroy heads to Pebble Beach, where the third major of 2019 begins on Thursday, having routed the field at the Canadian Open. Weekend rounds of 64 and 61 meant he prevailed in Ontario by seven. He is now, suddenly, the short\u2011priced US Open favourite in many outlets.

      "body": "<p>Matt Groening could do no wrong in 1999. The Simpsons was still both witty and money-spinning, and he could get any project he wanted greenlit \u2013 even a sci-fi comedy cartoon called Futurama. The show began with New Year\u2019s Eve 1999, when disillusioned pizza delivery boy Philip J Fry fell into a cryogenic vat, only to awaken 1,000 years later in \u201cthe world of tomorrow!\u201d. His excitement at his new life was tempered by finding out everyone in the future has a career assigned by the government, and his job was to be a delivery boy for Planet Express \u2013 motto: \u201cOur crew is replaceable, your package isn\u2019t!\u201d</p> <p>On board the Planet Express spaceship with the immature and slovenly Fry were cyclops orphan Leela, drunken robot Bender, clumsy intern Amy and incompetent alien medical lobster Dr Zoidberg: a crew of misfits seemingly designed to connect directly to the types of misfits who watch cartoon science fiction. Every mission was an adventure, whether it be discovering a parallel universe in a cardboard box or battling parasites in Fry\u2019s bowels. Present-day celebrities made cameos as preserved heads in jars, which was a lot more satisfying than how The Simpsons handled them. Everyone from Stephen Hawking (\u201cThat physicist who invented gravity\u201d) to Al Gore (\u201cInventor of the internet\u201d) was willing to be decapitated to appear on the funniest show on TV.</p> <p>Unlike some shows aimed at nerds that just shouted science words and played a laugh track (bazinga!), Futurama really was as clever as it seemed. Jokes about superdupersymmetric string theory or written in binary code were included for viewers with the nerd credentials to recognise them. Unfortunately, the Fox network, which initially aired Futurama from 1999 to 2003, didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Despite fan outcry, it axed Futurama after four brilliant seasons. But, like the show\u2019s Zombie Jesus, Futurama was brought back from the dead, moving to Comedy Central in 2008. Many of the old writers had moved on to bigger things, however, and instead of leaving a perfect legacy of genius comedy, the show decided to try new things. Like being stupid. And unfunny.</p> <p>If you can\u2019t come up with one good idea for an episode, the thinking on the undead Futurama seemed to be, why not just mash multiple tired ones together? The real low point came in the Futurama Holiday Spectacular, which combined songs with heavy-handed ecological morals across three unrelated stories. Murderous Christmas trees conquering Earth was, somehow, not the worst thing about it.</p> <p>In one classic early episode we learned that after Fry was frozen his loyal dog Seymour spent the rest of his life waiting outside Fry\u2019s old pizza shop for his master\u2019s return. The montage of the years passing before his death is often ranked among the most moving moments in TV history. Even this couldn\u2019t be left alone in the reboot, however. When time travel is introduced \u2013 always a killer in sci-fi plots \u2013 Seymour is given a happy ending, robbing his first death of its meaning. Who would have guessed that the creator of The Simpsons wouldn\u2019t know when to let go?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Matt Groening could do no wrong in 1999. The Simpsons was still both witty and money-spinning, and he could get any project he wanted greenlit \u2013 even a sci-fi comedy cartoon called Futurama. The show began with New Year\u2019s Eve 1999, when disillusioned pizza delivery boy Philip J Fry fell into a cryogenic vat, only to awaken 1,000 years later in \u201cthe world of tomorrow!\u201d. His excitement at his new life was tempered by finding out everyone in the future has a career assigned by the government, and his job was to be a delivery boy for Planet Express \u2013 motto: \u201cOur crew is replaceable, your package isn\u2019t!\u201d On board the Planet Express spaceship with the immature and slovenly Fry were cyclops orphan Leela, drunken robot Bender, clumsy intern Amy and incompetent alien medical lobster Dr Zoidberg: a crew of misfits seemingly designed to connect directly to the types of misfits who watch cartoon science fiction. Every mission was an adventure, whether it be discovering a parallel universe in a cardboard box or battling parasites in Fry\u2019s bowels. Present-day celebrities made cameos as preserved heads in jars, which was a lot more satisfying than how The Simpsons handled them. Everyone from Stephen Hawking (\u201cThat physicist who invented gravity\u201d) to Al Gore (\u201cInventor of the internet\u201d) was willing to be decapitated to appear on the funniest show on TV. Unlike some shows aimed at nerds that just shouted science words and played a laugh track (bazinga!), Futurama really was as clever as it seemed. Jokes about superdupersymmetric string theory or written in binary code were included for viewers with the nerd credentials to recognise them. Unfortunately, the Fox network, which initially aired Futurama from 1999 to 2003, didn\u2019t know what to do with it. Despite fan outcry, it axed Futurama after four brilliant seasons. But, like the show\u2019s Zombie Jesus, Futurama was brought back from the dead, moving to Comedy Central in 2008. Many of the old writers had moved on to bigger things, however, and instead of leaving a perfect legacy of genius comedy, the show decided to try new things. Like being stupid. And unfunny. If you can\u2019t come up with one good idea for an episode, the thinking on the undead Futurama seemed to be, why not just mash multiple tired ones together? The real low point came in the Futurama Holiday Spectacular, which combined songs with heavy-handed ecological morals across three unrelated stories. Murderous Christmas trees conquering Earth was, somehow, not the worst thing about it. In one classic early episode we learned that after Fry was frozen his loyal dog Seymour spent the rest of his life waiting outside Fry\u2019s old pizza shop for his master\u2019s return. The montage of the years passing before his death is often ranked among the most moving moments in TV history. Even this couldn\u2019t be left alone in the reboot, however. When time travel is introduced \u2013 always a killer in sci-fi plots \u2013 Seymour is given a happy ending, robbing his first death of its meaning. Who would have guessed that the creator of The Simpsons wouldn\u2019t know when to let go?",

We identify more with Andy \u2013 although Joshua\u2019s a great guy and an unbelievable athlete.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us have more in common with Andy. Looking at Andy we\u2019re looking at ourselves and seeing that anything is possible. We have children being bullied for being overweight or for the colour of their skin. It\u2019s horrible but Andy\u2019s story is a lesson in hope. He had to endure being harassed because he doesn\u2019t have a Joshua-type body. He\u2019s been teased for his looks. He\u2019s been doubted his whole life, because Andy\u2019s always been overweight.\u201d</p> <p>Was he bullied as a kid? \u201cAbsolutely but Andy fought back. He always had great self-esteem. He\u2019s a positive individual in spite of the way he may look.

He was ready to throw in the towel. He was at a dark stage but I sat down with him and said: \u2018Hey kid, don\u2019t give up. A year from now everything is going to be different. I had a dream you fought Joshua for the world title. I know exactly what punch you\u2019ll knock him out with.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was this just a little yarn to boost his sagging fighter? \u201cI did have the dream,\u201d Robles insists, \u201cbecause Andy\u2019s special. Even when he wasn\u2019t showing up in the gym, I would call him: \u2018Where you at kid? We\u2019ll pick you up.\u2019 There was a point when he didn\u2019t have a place to stay in LA. My friend had an extra room in his apartment so I asked him to help. Not only did he give Andy a roof over his head but he also became his chef. Everything changed when Andy came back to the gym in January. He came in with a big promoter [Al Haymon] who got him a fight with Alexander Dimitrenko in April. We had a 10-week camp.\u201d</p> <p>Ruiz was given the unexpected opportunity to fight Joshua when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2019/apr/20/jarrell-miller-apologises-after-reports-of-second-failed-drug-test-video\" title=\"\">the champion\u2019s original opponent, Jarrell Miller, failed a drug test</a>. Despite his flabby appearance, Ruiz was battle-hardened after beating Dimitrenko who is, in Ruiz\u2019s phrase, \u201ca huge guy\u201d at 6ft 7in.</p> <p>Robles is canny and he knew Joshua has a tendency to drop his left hand after throwing a jab. So he always felt Joshua was open to be being knocked out by an overhand right. encouraged Ruiz to fight on the inside, using the angles against a much bigger man and working on the body punches that would drain Joshua. They also prepared the overhand right that would shatter Joshua\u2019s mystique.</p> <p>Ruiz, as a consequence, was strikingly relaxed before his first world title fight.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Robles says. \u201cBoxers feed off their coaches. If you stay relaxed and positive they\u2019re the same. If you\u2019re nervous they sense it. Our job, as coaches, is to keep it positive, talk about the gameplan and stay as calm as possible. But yeah, as Mike Tyson said, everybody\u2019s got a plan until they get hit in the face.\u201d</p> <p>How did Robles react when Joshua dropped Ruiz? \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had a boxer go down. It won\u2019t be the last. I stay relaxed. Next thing Andy drops Joshua twice [with two big right hands]. But you don\u2019t make a big deal of it. You get your boxer to stay calm and stick to the gameplan. Of course I was excited on the inside but I knew Joshua was still dangerous. Sure enough, we had to make some changes that benefited Andy.\u201d</p> <p>When the end came, with Joshua glazed and beaten, Robles was not the only member of his family to shed tears. \u201cI have 25-year-old twins, and one of them, <a href=\"http://boxrec.com/en/boxer/628113\" title=\"\">my son, Manny Robles the third, is 18-0</a> as a pro. They were there with my wife and youngest daughter, because I was so positive. I wanted my family to witness the victory.</p> <p>\u201cMy wife found it difficult to watch. My kids told me she kept her head down and prayed for Andy. When the fight was over the kids said: \u2018Mom, we won.\u2019 She couldn\u2019t believe it. She broke down crying. My kids broke out crying. I\u2019d never seen my son cry before. He cried like a baby. Incredible.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"26b35040614cbee1fb7046d653f985a76a2c6838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26b35040614cbee1fb7046d653f985a76a2c6838/49_150_3438_2063/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Ruiz Jr celebrates with his team after defeating Anthony Joshua at Madison Square Garden this month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Ruiz Jr celebrates with his team after defeating Anthony Joshua at Madison Square Garden this month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images via Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Robles cried when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rx2H2FXcfa4\" title=\"\">talking to reporters after the fight</a> and now, in his hushed gym, he explains the reasons: \u201cMy story is of a young immigrant boy that came to the United States. My parents were trying to find a better life for us. I was six years old and can you imagine the difficulties? Coming to this strange country, not speaking the language, going to school with kids that only spoke English. As an immigrant I wasn\u2019t able to gain a proper education. I couldn\u2019t have a good job because I didn\u2019t have any documents or a social security number. I was illegal.\u201d</p> <p>His father, Manuel, was a well\u2011known boxing trainer. \u201cEverything I know comes from my dad. He was my mentor, my teacher, my best friend. I lost my dad on 3 March 2007 and the whole world came down on me. I also lost my job as I was involved in boxing with my dad. I lost my house. I hit rock bottom but Sandra, my wife of 25 years, hung in with me.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s actually from the same city as me in Mexico. Guadalajara. Sandra became a US citizen first and she filed papers for me. That\u2019s how I became a United States resident. The moment I became a resident I went to school. I was 34. Imagine being in this country from the age of six to 34 without a passport. Imagine not being able to get a job with decent pay. It was my dream to become a citizen and take care of my family. After I went to school for four years, I got my degree in carpentry. Life is perseverance.\u201d</p> <p>In 2009, Robles became involved in amateur boxing while training his son. \u201cI was working as a carpenter in the day and going to the gym at night. My fighters started winning regional, state and national tournaments. I started getting recognition. But even when I was a coach on the US national team I wasn\u2019t a citizen. I was a permanent resident. At the world championships in 2011 this other US coach noticed my Mexican passport. He said: \u2018You\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u2019 That hurt me so much but, wow, the kids embraced me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Joshua will come in with a new game plan but so will we. I\u2019ll be looking at Joshua to see how we can improve</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At those same world championships, Robles met Joshua. \u201cI respect Anthony Joshua, man. He\u2019s such a humble, good person. He wins the silver medal but I thought he deserved gold. After the fight we\u2019re on the bus together. It\u2019s astonishing how mellow this kid is with his silver medal. Who knows how he felt inside? I congratulated him and we took a picture. He was such a gentleman. He\u2019s the same now as in 2011.\u201d</p> <p>Joshua has been criticised for accepting defeat against Ruiz too easily. He has also been told to ditch his trainer Robert McCracken. \u201cHis coach has taken a lot of heat,\u201d Robles says. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible. But Joshua is very loyal.\u201d</p> <p>Four of Robles\u2019s best boxers \u2013 \u00d3scar Valdez, Jessie Magdaleno, Dominic Breazeale and Michael Conlan \u2013 left him. The first two were world champions, Breazeale fought twice for the world heavyweight title and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/behind-the-lines/2019/feb/28/michael-conlan-prize-fighting-family-boxing\" title=\"\">Conlan is one of boxing\u2019s brightest prospects</a>. Stressing that he remains friends with Valdez and Conlan, Robles does not harbour grudges. Each boxer had a specific reason for leaving \u2013 with Conlan, for example, needing to train closer to home in Belfast. But the loss hurts.</p> <p>\u201cThe <a href=\"https://www.espn.co.uk/boxing/story/_/id/24369228/oscar-valdez-replaces-trainer-manny-robles-eddy-reynoso\" title=\"\">\u00d3scar Valdez situation</a> is different,\u201d Robles says. \u201c\u00d3scar didn\u2019t want to leave. His manager [Frank Espinoza] and his dad had other ideas for him. He left along with every fighter managed by Espinoza. He took them off me for political reasons outside of boxing \u2013 not for my coaching.\u201d</p> <p>Robles initially asks to keep this between ourselves but, eventually, he says: \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m tired of people thinking \u00d3scar left because I wasn\u2019t doing a good job. You can ask \u00d3scar yourself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0416517b74fbb0315e2e7fbc1fbef1d3f7ef4c41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0416517b74fbb0315e2e7fbc1fbef1d3f7ef4c41/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manny Robles in his Legendz Boxing gym in Norwalk, California.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manny Robles in his Legendz Boxing gym in Norwalk, California.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Tuffs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now that he and Ruiz are on the rise does he believe the rematch with Joshua will result in a similar outcome? \u201cJoshua will come in with a new gameplan but so will we.

He\u2019s a warrior and every time fighters step into the ring they put their lives on the line. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unfortunate people who have never boxed booed Joshua.\u201d</p> <p>The heavyweight division is full of intrigue and Robles says: \u201cSkills pay the bills, man, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/02/tyson-fury-wbc-heavyweight-boxing-deontay-wilder-split-draw\" title=\"\">Tyson Fury\u2019s got the skills</a>.

He was ready to throw in the towel. He was at a dark stage but I sat down with him and said: \u2018Hey kid, don\u2019t give up. A year from now everything is going to be different. I had a dream you fought Joshua for the world title. I know exactly what punch you\u2019ll knock him out with.\u2019\u201d Was this just a little yarn to boost his sagging fighter? \u201cI did have the dream,\u201d Robles insists, \u201cbecause Andy\u2019s special. Even when he wasn\u2019t showing up in the gym, I would call him: \u2018Where you at kid? We\u2019ll pick you up.\u2019 There was a point when he didn\u2019t have a place to stay in LA. My friend had an extra room in his apartment so I asked him to help. Not only did he give Andy a roof over his head but he also became his chef. Everything changed when Andy came back to the gym in January. He came in with a big promoter [Al Haymon] who got him a fight with Alexander Dimitrenko in April. We had a 10-week camp.\u201d Ruiz was given the unexpected opportunity to fight Joshua when the champion\u2019s original opponent, Jarrell Miller, failed a drug test. Despite his flabby appearance, Ruiz was battle-hardened after beating Dimitrenko who is, in Ruiz\u2019s phrase, \u201ca huge guy\u201d at 6ft 7in. Robles is canny and he knew Joshua has a tendency to drop his left hand after throwing a jab. So he always felt Joshua was open to be being knocked out by an overhand right. encouraged Ruiz to fight on the inside, using the angles against a much bigger man and working on the body punches that would drain Joshua. They also prepared the overhand right that would shatter Joshua\u2019s mystique. Ruiz, as a consequence, was strikingly relaxed before his first world title fight. \u201cIt\u2019s simple,\u201d Robles says. \u201cBoxers feed off their coaches. If you stay relaxed and positive they\u2019re the same. If you\u2019re nervous they sense it. Our job, as coaches, is to keep it positive, talk about the gameplan and stay as calm as possible. But yeah, as Mike Tyson said, everybody\u2019s got a plan until they get hit in the face.\u201d How did Robles react when Joshua dropped Ruiz? \u201cIt\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve had a boxer go down. It won\u2019t be the last. I stay relaxed. Next thing Andy drops Joshua twice [with two big right hands]. But you don\u2019t make a big deal of it. You get your boxer to stay calm and stick to the gameplan. Of course I was excited on the inside but I knew Joshua was still dangerous. Sure enough, we had to make some changes that benefited Andy.\u201d When the end came, with Joshua glazed and beaten, Robles was not the only member of his family to shed tears. \u201cI have 25-year-old twins, and one of them, my son, Manny Robles the third, is 18-0 as a pro. They were there with my wife and youngest daughter, because I was so positive. I wanted my family to witness the victory. \u201cMy wife found it difficult to watch. My kids told me she kept her head down and prayed for Andy. When the fight was over the kids said: \u2018Mom, we won.\u2019 She couldn\u2019t believe it. She broke down crying. My kids broke out crying. I\u2019d never seen my son cry before. He cried like a baby. Incredible.\u201d Robles cried when talking to reporters after the fight and now, in his hushed gym, he explains the reasons: \u201cMy story is of a young immigrant boy that came to the United States. My parents were trying to find a better life for us. I was six years old and can you imagine the difficulties? Coming to this strange country, not speaking the language, going to school with kids that only spoke English. As an immigrant I wasn\u2019t able to gain a proper education. I couldn\u2019t have a good job because I didn\u2019t have any documents or a social security number. I was illegal.\u201d His father, Manuel, was a well\u2011known boxing trainer. \u201cEverything I know comes from my dad. He was my mentor, my teacher, my best friend. I lost my dad on 3 March 2007 and the whole world came down on me. I also lost my job as I was involved in boxing with my dad. I lost my house. I hit rock bottom but Sandra, my wife of 25 years, hung in with me. \u201cShe\u2019s actually from the same city as me in Mexico. Guadalajara. Sandra became a US citizen first and she filed papers for me. That\u2019s how I became a United States resident. The moment I became a resident I went to school. I was 34. Imagine being in this country from the age of six to 34 without a passport. Imagine not being able to get a job with decent pay. It was my dream to become a citizen and take care of my family. After I went to school for four years, I got my degree in carpentry. Life is perseverance.\u201d In 2009, Robles became involved in amateur boxing while training his son. \u201cI was working as a carpenter in the day and going to the gym at night. My fighters started winning regional, state and national tournaments. I started getting recognition. But even when I was a coach on the US national team I wasn\u2019t a citizen. I was a permanent resident. At the world championships in 2011 this other US coach noticed my Mexican passport. He said: \u2018You\u2019re not supposed to be here.\u2019 That hurt me so much but, wow, the kids embraced me.\u201d At those same world championships, Robles met Joshua. \u201cI respect Anthony Joshua, man. He\u2019s such a humble, good person. He wins the silver medal but I thought he deserved gold. After the fight we\u2019re on the bus together. It\u2019s astonishing how mellow this kid is with his silver medal. Who knows how he felt inside? I congratulated him and we took a picture. He was such a gentleman. He\u2019s the same now as in 2011.\u201d Joshua has been criticised for accepting defeat against Ruiz too easily. He has also been told to ditch his trainer Robert McCracken. \u201cHis coach has taken a lot of heat,\u201d Robles says. \u201cThat\u2019s horrible. But Joshua is very loyal.\u201d Four of Robles\u2019s best boxers \u2013 \u00d3scar Valdez, Jessie Magdaleno, Dominic Breazeale and Michael Conlan \u2013 left him. The first two were world champions, Breazeale fought twice for the world heavyweight title and Conlan is one of boxing\u2019s brightest prospects. Stressing that he remains friends with Valdez and Conlan, Robles does not harbour grudges. Each boxer had a specific reason for leaving \u2013 with Conlan, for example, needing to train closer to home in Belfast. But the loss hurts. \u201cThe \u00d3scar Valdez situation is different,\u201d Robles says. \u201c\u00d3scar didn\u2019t want to leave. His manager [Frank Espinoza] and his dad had other ideas for him. He left along with every fighter managed by Espinoza. He took them off me for political reasons outside of boxing \u2013 not for my coaching.\u201d Robles initially asks to keep this between ourselves but, eventually, he says: \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m tired of people thinking \u00d3scar left because I wasn\u2019t doing a good job. You can ask \u00d3scar yourself.\u201d Now that he and Ruiz are on the rise does he believe the rematch with Joshua will result in a similar outcome? \u201cJoshua will come in with a new gameplan but so will we. I\u2019ll be looking at Joshua to see how we can improve. \u201cI respect Joshua because he hasn\u2019t used any excuses. He\u2019s a warrior and every time fighters step into the ring they put their lives on the line. That\u2019s why it\u2019s unfortunate people who have never boxed booed Joshua.\u201d The heavyweight division is full of intrigue and Robles says: \u201cSkills pay the bills, man, and Tyson Fury\u2019s got the skills. But Deontay Wilder\u2019s got the power. With that kind of power anything can happen.\u201d Can his rotund champion beat all three of his famous rivals? \u201cAbsolutely. Andy Ruiz can compete with anyone. He\u2019s proved that.\u201d On Monday, Robles and Ruiz flew to Mexico to meet the president \u2013 Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable. Everything feels awesome.\u201d Robles laughs when I say it would feel less awesome if they were meeting Donald Trump. \u201cWe\u2019re happier going to the Mexican White House. It hasn\u2019t been an easy time with Trump. He and his policies are not helpful for most of us. In the US we have people from all over the world. This is a country of immigrants. But Trump was busy [last] week with you guys in the UK. I wish you could keep him.\u201d Ruiz has appeared on the glossy TV circuit but Robles remains low\u2011key. \u201cAndy\u2019s dad called and said: \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going on the Jimmy Kimmel Show. Would you join us?\u2019 I said: \u2018\u2018No, I\u2019m working.\u2019 I flew in from New York on Sunday night and I was back in the gym on Monday.\u201d The trick will be for Robles to ensure Ruiz echoes that attitude. \u201cAndy\u2019s the world champion, so we have to make sure he stays disciplined and grounded. My job is to keep him in line and remind him what got him here. \u201cI know Andy will listen. We\u2019ve been through too much to give it all up.\u201d",

It would take an hour to fully charge and could release enough electricity over an hour to fully charge 806 Nissan Leaf vehicles over a total of 182,000 miles, according to a spokesman for Scottish Power.</p> <p>Keith Anderson, Scottish Power\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cBatteries will take renewable energy to the next level. It is a nice, neat solution to help use more and more renewable power in the UK, because that\u2019s what we need to be doing to reach a net zero-carbon economy.\u201d</p> <p>The lithium-ion battery will help Whitelee, already one of the largest onshore windfarms in Europe, to generate more renewable power by storing electricity when wind speeds are high, for use when the wind drops.</p> <p>\u201cOver a period of time, we will get to use much more wind output from the project, and across the whole of the country, because even at times of low demand we will be able to capture far more of the wind rather than wasting that potential energy,\u201d he said.</p> <p>For example, the batteries could charge overnight \u2013 when demand for power is low \u2013 and release electricity in the morning, when demand from homes and businesses begins to rise.</p> <p>The on-site batteries will also be used to help even out the UK\u2019s \u201cquite clunky\u201d energy system by releasing short bursts of power to fill in second-by-second fluctuations in renewable energy generation. \u201cThey can react in milliseconds and are incredibly useful as a virtually instantaneous tool for the energy system operator,\u201d Anderson said.</p> <p>Scottish Power\u2019s battery rollout is the UK\u2019s most ambitious move into the emerging energy storage sector, which includes projects from the FTSE energy giants Drax and Centrica as well as its wind power rival, \u00d8rsted.</p> <p>Paul Wheelhouse, Scotland\u2019s energy minister, said the project was an \u201cexciting new chapter for Whitelee\u201d. The windfarm was one of the first major onshore projects built in the UK 10 years ago.</p> <p>Wheelhouse said it offered \u201ca number of real potential benefits for Scotland\u2019s energy systems, and the Scottish government will continue to support innovation and deployment in this area\u201d. </p> <p>Scottish Power will begin construction work at the Whitelee project early next year and expects the facility to be fully operational by the end of 2020.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The plans have emerged just months after Scottish Power sloughed off its remaining fossil fuel power plants to become the first major energy supplier to generate all its electricity from renewable energy sources.</p> <p>The company struck a \u00a3700m deal with Drax last year to hand over its four remaining gas power stations in England to focus exclusively on investing in renewable power and its energy networks business.</p> <p>\u201cOver the next 10 to 20 years, batteries will become a much more important part of the system.

      "bodyText": "Scottish Power is to undertake the most ambitious battery power project in Europe in an attempt to unlock the potential of the UK\u2019s wind and solar farms. The company will connect an industrial-scale battery, the size of half a football pitch, to the Whitelee onshore windfarm early next year to capture more power from its 215 turbines. The first major onshore wind power storage project will lead the way for a string of similar projects across at least six of Scottish Power\u2019s largest renewable energy sites over the following 18 months. It claims the 50MW battery systems promise a \u201csignificant step\u201d on the road towards renewable energy, providing baseload, or continuous electricity supply, for the UK energy system. The battery has more than double the power capacity of any existing battery in the UK. It would take an hour to fully charge and could release enough electricity over an hour to fully charge 806 Nissan Leaf vehicles over a total of 182,000 miles, according to a spokesman for Scottish Power. Keith Anderson, Scottish Power\u2019s chief executive, said: \u201cBatteries will take renewable energy to the next level. It is a nice, neat solution to help use more and more renewable power in the UK, because that\u2019s what we need to be doing to reach a net zero-carbon economy.\u201d The lithium-ion battery will help Whitelee, already one of the largest onshore windfarms in Europe, to generate more renewable power by storing electricity when wind speeds are high, for use when the wind drops. \u201cOver a period of time, we will get to use much more wind output from the project, and across the whole of the country, because even at times of low demand we will be able to capture far more of the wind rather than wasting that potential energy,\u201d he said. For example, the batteries could charge overnight \u2013 when demand for power is low \u2013 and release electricity in the morning, when demand from homes and businesses begins to rise. The on-site batteries will also be used to help even out the UK\u2019s \u201cquite clunky\u201d energy system by releasing short bursts of power to fill in second-by-second fluctuations in renewable energy generation. \u201cThey can react in milliseconds and are incredibly useful as a virtually instantaneous tool for the energy system operator,\u201d Anderson said. Scottish Power\u2019s battery rollout is the UK\u2019s most ambitious move into the emerging energy storage sector, which includes projects from the FTSE energy giants Drax and Centrica as well as its wind power rival, \u00d8rsted. Paul Wheelhouse, Scotland\u2019s energy minister, said the project was an \u201cexciting new chapter for Whitelee\u201d. The windfarm was one of the first major onshore projects built in the UK 10 years ago. Wheelhouse said it offered \u201ca number of real potential benefits for Scotland\u2019s energy systems, and the Scottish government will continue to support innovation and deployment in this area\u201d. Scottish Power will begin construction work at the Whitelee project early next year and expects the facility to be fully operational by the end of 2020. The plans have emerged just months after Scottish Power sloughed off its remaining fossil fuel power plants to become the first major energy supplier to generate all its electricity from renewable energy sources. The company struck a \u00a3700m deal with Drax last year to hand over its four remaining gas power stations in England to focus exclusively on investing in renewable power and its energy networks business. \u201cOver the next 10 to 20 years, batteries will become a much more important part of the system. We want to start now,\u201d Anderson said.",

They are not from last year, the year before or even the year before that. Real Madrid\u2019s manager said that in April 2010, almost a decade ago, when the Frenchman was just about to return to the Bernab\u00e9u as presidential adviser and Hazard was 19 and playing for Lille. He was also, Zidane said, \u201cthe star of the future\u201d. Now, aged 28, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/eden-hazard-completes-move-from-chelsea-to-real-madrid\" title=\"\">he is Madrid\u2019s present</a>, not just their latest <em>gal\u00e1ctico</em> but their first for five years. He has been a long time coming.</p> <p>This is the chronicle of a signing foretold, one in which both sides have been open about their mutual attraction. There is an honesty about the way Hazard has spoken and a certain loyalty too \u2013 not just to Madrid or to Zidane but to Chelsea. He made no secret of his wish to go and, although his public pronouncements may not always have pleased, they were invariably framed with respect, a promise to do things the right way and a willingness to stay. He did not rebel, as Madrid would have liked, and that is partly why it has taken so long. Instead he embraced his commitment to Chelsea, insisting they would decide. And then he waited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/eden-hazard-completes-move-from-chelsea-to-real-madrid\">Eden Hazard confirms he is set to join Real Madrid from Chelsea for \u00a388.5m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While he waited he won. At the end of his seventh season Hazard leaves Stamford Bridge having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/29/chelsea-arsenal-europa-league-final-match-report-eden-hazard\" title=\"\">led Chelsea to a second Europa League</a> to go with two league titles, a League Cup and an FA Cup secured in London. In 2015 he was the PFA Player of the Year.</p> <p>That summer Zidane, then coach of Real Madrid\u2019s B team, Castilla, recommended his signing, just as he had done in 2010. In November 2015 he said: \u201cAfter Cristiano and Messi Eden is the player I like the best. It\u2019s spectacular seeing him play.\u201d When he became first-team coach, recommendation became request. In the spring of 2017 Madrid put together a plan to sign Hazard, and Thibaut Courtois too, if they could. In early summer 2018, before walking away, Zidane asked again. This summer, back at the Bernab\u00e9u, he did not so much ask as demand.</p> <p>Throughout this period the presence of others \u2013 Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Isco, Marco Asensio \u2013 meant the need was not always pressing and some on the board had doubts. But contact had long since been established, commitments made, the pieces put into place. And when Zidane returned in 2019, handed greater authority to build a team, the Belgian was a priority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d8c52de1eed2d0a04a0c59a20554281cda540e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d8c52de1eed2d0a04a0c59a20554281cda540e4/193_315_3123_1874/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eden Hazard leaves Chelsea after helping them to win the Europa League.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eden Hazard leaves Chelsea after helping them to win the Europa League.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bradley Collyer/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Madrid, meanwhile, was Hazard\u2019s priority. He did not force an early exit but he did help make an exit possible. In November 2017 Hazard admitted his admiration for Madrid. A month later his father, Thierry, admitted his son had rejected a contract renewal so he could answer the call from Madrid, if it came \u2013 as he had been reassured it would. At the last World Cup he gave an interview to L\u2019\u00c9quipe in which he invited Madrid to do just that. And following the third-place play-off in Russia he said that after \u201csix wonderful years\u201d at Chelsea it might be time to experience something different. \u201cYou already know my preferences,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Everyone did. \u201cEden should be with me, always,\u201d Courtois said. \u201cWherever I am, I would take Eden.\u201d By then Courtois knew he was likely to be on his way to Madrid and he, unlike Hazard, was prepared to risk a confrontation to force the deal through. He hoped Hazard would join him but their situations differed: Courtois had a year less on his contract than Hazard, and that was vital.</p> <p>\u201cMadrid interest me, everyone knows. If they want to sign me, they know what they have to do,\u201d Hazard said, but it was not so easy. Chelsea declared him not for sale, Madrid had neither the stomach nor the wallet for a battle and so the wait went on.</p> <p>Zidane had gone, too. But the interest had not. Hazard had pointed out that Madrid is still Madrid, even without Zidane. And although last summer was too soon, time was at last on his side. In December Hazard told Radio Montecarlo: \u201cYou know I have always liked Real Madrid, even before Zidane.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI would take Eden Hazard with my eyes closed.\u201d Zinedine Zidane\u2019s words are not from this week or last. They are not from last year, the year before or even the year before that. Real Madrid\u2019s manager said that in April 2010, almost a decade ago, when the Frenchman was just about to return to the Bernab\u00e9u as presidential adviser and Hazard was 19 and playing for Lille. He was also, Zidane said, \u201cthe star of the future\u201d. Now, aged 28, he is Madrid\u2019s present, not just their latest gal\u00e1ctico but their first for five years. He has been a long time coming. This is the chronicle of a signing foretold, one in which both sides have been open about their mutual attraction. There is an honesty about the way Hazard has spoken and a certain loyalty too \u2013 not just to Madrid or to Zidane but to Chelsea. He made no secret of his wish to go and, although his public pronouncements may not always have pleased, they were invariably framed with respect, a promise to do things the right way and a willingness to stay. He did not rebel, as Madrid would have liked, and that is partly why it has taken so long. Instead he embraced his commitment to Chelsea, insisting they would decide. And then he waited. While he waited he won. At the end of his seventh season Hazard leaves Stamford Bridge having led Chelsea to a second Europa League to go with two league titles, a League Cup and an FA Cup secured in London. In 2015 he was the PFA Player of the Year. That summer Zidane, then coach of Real Madrid\u2019s B team, Castilla, recommended his signing, just as he had done in 2010. In November 2015 he said: \u201cAfter Cristiano and Messi Eden is the player I like the best. It\u2019s spectacular seeing him play.\u201d When he became first-team coach, recommendation became request. In the spring of 2017 Madrid put together a plan to sign Hazard, and Thibaut Courtois too, if they could. In early summer 2018, before walking away, Zidane asked again. This summer, back at the Bernab\u00e9u, he did not so much ask as demand. Throughout this period the presence of others \u2013 Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Isco, Marco Asensio \u2013 meant the need was not always pressing and some on the board had doubts. But contact had long since been established, commitments made, the pieces put into place. And when Zidane returned in 2019, handed greater authority to build a team, the Belgian was a priority. Madrid, meanwhile, was Hazard\u2019s priority. He did not force an early exit but he did help make an exit possible. In November 2017 Hazard admitted his admiration for Madrid. A month later his father, Thierry, admitted his son had rejected a contract renewal so he could answer the call from Madrid, if it came \u2013 as he had been reassured it would. At the last World Cup he gave an interview to L\u2019\u00c9quipe in which he invited Madrid to do just that. And following the third-place play-off in Russia he said that after \u201csix wonderful years\u201d at Chelsea it might be time to experience something different. \u201cYou already know my preferences,\u201d he said. Everyone did. \u201cEden should be with me, always,\u201d Courtois said. \u201cWherever I am, I would take Eden.\u201d By then Courtois knew he was likely to be on his way to Madrid and he, unlike Hazard, was prepared to risk a confrontation to force the deal through. He hoped Hazard would join him but their situations differed: Courtois had a year less on his contract than Hazard, and that was vital. \u201cMadrid interest me, everyone knows. If they want to sign me, they know what they have to do,\u201d Hazard said, but it was not so easy. Chelsea declared him not for sale, Madrid had neither the stomach nor the wallet for a battle and so the wait went on. Zidane had gone, too. But the interest had not. Hazard had pointed out that Madrid is still Madrid, even without Zidane. And although last summer was too soon, time was at last on his side. In December Hazard told Radio Montecarlo: \u201cYou know I have always liked Real Madrid, even before Zidane. After this year I have a year left on my contract, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d That fact facilitated everything. Last week Madrid\u2019s president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, admitted: \u201cHazard is one of the greats left in world football but then we wanted him last year too. Now he has only one year left on his contract it\u2019s easier.\u201d Now Madrid have Zidane back he is the one who must make it work. With Vinicius, Asensio, Isco, Rodrygo, Lucas V\u00e1zquez, Brahim D\u00edaz, Karim Benzema, new signing Luka Jovic, and maybe even Bale still, there is not an obvious fit for so many footballers. Vinicius, in particular, plays where Hazard does, coming in from the left \u2013 and the Brazilian was just about the only light in an otherwise dreadful season. But then Hazard is the man Roberto Mart\u00ednez declared \u201cas good as anyone in the world\u201d, Enzo Scifo called a \u201cgenius\u201d, and his former Chelsea teammate Kepa Arrizabalaga described as \u201ca truly great player, who\u2019d be a starter for any team in the world\u201d. Madrid\u2019s full-back Dani Carvajal said: \u201cIf he comes, which looks more than possible, he\u2019s world-class: we\u2019ve seen that for years. He\u2019ll give us that spark, that player who\u2019s hecho [the finished article], with galones [status, rank] who doesn\u2019t hide, who runs at people, who assists, scores goals. I\u2019m sure he can give us a huge amount.\u201d The key words there may be hecho and galones. Vinicius is 19. Hazard starts; the question is whether others do, and where. Zidane has admitted there will be changes in Madrid\u2019s shape: in the current 4-3-3 Hazard\u2019s natural role would be on the left of the front three or \u2013 less convincing, especially in the light of the signing of Jovic \u2013 as a false nine. But Zidane was only truly wedded to 4-3-3 by Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo and 4-4-2 with Hazard up front is not impossible, although a more likely option would be for Madrid to play 4-2-3-1 with Hazard immediately behind the striker, or even a 4-2-1-3 with the Belgian as the one. Either way Real remain convinced that Hazard is no problem: he is the solution and one Zidane first saw a decade ago. \u201cWe have been trying to make Hazard a Madrid player for quite a few years but we haven\u2019t managed to until now,\u201d P\u00e9rez said.",

      "bodyText": "Violence targeted against female politicians and activists will be tracked for the first time by a global database, amid indications of a recent rise in attacks. Researchers reviewed thousands of events dating back to 1997, where political violence was targeted at women \u2013 ranging from wartime sexual violence to attacks on female civilians and crackdowns on female-led protests. It\u2019s hoped the data, which will be updated on a weekly basis by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), will help provide a better understanding of the threats facing women. Analysis by the group suggests a recent spike in violence, with twice as many cases reported during the first quarter of 2019 (261 events) as during the first quarter of 2018 (125 events). The information was obtained from reports collected across Africa, south-east Asia, south Asia, the Middle East, south-eastern and eastern Europe and the Balkans. The data covers political violence targeted against women from all walks of life, not just those actively involved in campaigning. \u201cThere has been a lot of anecdotal evidence [suggesting] that women are faced with more and more targeting, but we didn\u2019t have a systematic way to compare this,\u201d said Dr Roudabeh Kishi, research director of Acled, which produced the analysis in partnership with the Robert Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of Texas. A backlash against women\u2019s increasing presence in politics may have contributed towards the increase, she added. Across Africa \u2013 where Acled has collected data for the longest time period \u2013 violence that targeted women appeared to have increased. While 71 violent events targeting women were recorded in the first quarter of 2014, this grew to 156 in the first quarter of 2019. The data does not cover all forms of political violence experienced by women \u2013 attacks on civilians that target both men and women equally are not included in the measure. It also does not cover domestic or intimate partner violence, thought to be responsible for more than half the murders of women in 2017. The research found women-led protests \u2013 such as demonstrations by mothers of prisoners or women campaigning for reproductive rights \u2013 were more likely to be peaceful than other demonstrations. However, such events were disproportionately met with violent crackdowns, including the use of weapons, arrests and teargas, usually by state forces. Data shows variations in the kinds of political targeted violence women face around the world, Kishi said. \u201cIn south Asia, for example, the primary means in which women are targeted is by mob violence. Often these mobs will have links to political parties or religious groups.\u201d Compared with political violence that was not gender-based, women were more likely to experience sexual assaults, abductions, forced disappearances and mob violence. Kishi said that the majority (two-thirds) of violent attacks were not sexual. \u201cMost of the conversations we have around gender-based violence are usually linked to sexual violence and usually that\u2019s how we understand violence against women. To a degree that\u2019s fair \u2013 women are the predominant victims of that type of violence,\u201d she said. \u201cBut sexual violence is not the primary means by which women are targeted.\u201d It\u2019s hoped the data, which will be publicly accessible, will help guide policy. Data covering Latin America, central Asia and the Caucasus, western Europe and east Asia will be introduced in the coming months. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 June 2019. In an earlier version, a picture caption misdescribed Gabrielle Giffords as a Republican senator.",

      "bodyText": "Three one-day internationals (ODIs), one Test, three T20 matches \u2026 as a huge cricketing summer in England and Wales edges ever closer to exploding into life, the Women\u2019s Ashes offers the promise of producing plenty of entertainment and excitement. Old foes England and Australia will battle throughout July for the coveted Ashes trophy \u2013 and those all-important bragging rights \u2013 and it\u2019s a difficult result to call. England captain Heather Knight\u2019s team are the reigning ODI World Cup champions, having beaten India in the final at Lord\u2019s in July 2017, but the Australians convincingly claimed the World T20 title in the Caribbean in November 2018. With just one place separating the two teams in the Test rankings, the competition could hardly be closer. The Women\u2019s Ashes used to be an all-Test affair, like the men\u2019s, but for the August 2013 series it was radically overhauled to embrace the three major forms of the game. Then England captain Charlotte Edwards led her side to a convincing 12-4 victory in the first multi-format series, on home turf; the Test match was drawn and England won five of the six limited-overs matches, losing just one ODI. Five months later, Edwards and her side retained their trophy with a 10-8 victory, after winning the Test match (then worth six points) and picking up victory in one ODI and one T20 (worth two points each). The victorious women were rewarded by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) with \u201csignificant\u201d pay rises, as they became England\u2019s first full-time professional women\u2019s cricket team. \u201cToday is a day I never thought I would see in my time as a player,\u201d Edwards said afterwards. It\u2019s a far cry from 1995, when she had to pay for her team blazer for the tour of India, and shows just how far the women\u2019s game has come. It also highlights the continued importance of NatWest\u2019s partnership with the ECB and charities such as Chance to Shine \u2013 4 million children have taken part in the programme, half of whom have been girls \u2013 as they continue to support the future of women in the sport at a grassroots level. When Mark Robinson was appointed head coach in November 2015, he brought with him years of experience from coaching in the men\u2019s game, having previously been at the helm at Sussex. Robinson realised that the outgrounds occasionally used for England matches often stifled the power and ability of his players, with their tired, slower pitches, and insisted that all matches be played at county grounds. Two of the six chosen for this year\u2019s competition \u2013 Bristol and Chelmsford \u2013 hold particular significance for the England team. On 9 July 2017, a sold-out Bristol was the venue at which England\u2019s women defeated Australia in a World Cup match for the first time in 24 years \u2013 with a nail-biting three-run victory. But Australia\u2019s memories of the ground are not all bad. Two weeks earlier, their match against Sri Lanka featured two stellar performances. Sri Lankan captain Chamari Atapattu\u2019s 178 not out is still the fourth-highest ODI score, but it was Australian captain Meg Lanning who enjoyed the most memorable day, leading her team to victory with an unbeaten 152. As the last destination in this summer\u2019s Women\u2019s Ashes, for the final T20, Bristol, the spectators that fill the ground and the England team will be hoping for a repeat of the success as they aim to regain the Ashes. Another ground Knight\u2019s team have equally fond memories of is \u201cFortress Chelmsford\u201d, where the teams will contest the first T20I in a day/night match in Essex. England Women have never lost a limited-overs match at Chelmsford, winning five ODIs and eight T20s across 19 years, and the unbridled success the team have enjoyed there has helped the ground become the unofficial \u201chome\u201d of the team. Matches against Australia account for two of those ODI victories and two T20 victories. When the teams line up there for the first of the three T20 matches, it will be the first time Australia have returned to the Essex ground since 2015. With six points still up for grabs, it\u2019s likely the series will still be in the balance at that stage, \u201cFortress Chelmsford\u201d is likely to play a pivotal part in deciding the fate of the teams. Meg Lanning\u2019s Aussies head into this Women\u2019s Ashes holding the trophy, having triumphed in England in 2015 and retained the title on home soil in 2017, following a hard-fought 8-8 draw. With both teams boasting a number of match-winning talents in their squads this time around, a tantalising Women\u2019s Ashes awaits, in what could be one of the greatest summer\u2019s in English cricket.

According to the Office for National Statistics, gross domestic product (GDP) plunged by 0.4% in April from a month earlier as factories across the country launched a wave of planned shutdowns to avoid any disruption that could have been unleashed by a no-deal Brexit. Britain\u2019s manufacturers planned around leaving the EU on 29 March as Theresa May took the country to the brink of leaving without a deal, before agreeing an extension until 12 April and then delaying the process until the end of October. She then agreed to stand down as prime minister, triggering the Conservative leadership contest. While economic growth had strengthened as factories rushed to stockpile materials ahead of the deadline, the latest snapshot from the economy shows that production slumped after the target date passed. The decline is the worst monthly GDP performance for the UK since March 2016. Rob Kent-Smith, the head of GDP at the government statistics agency, said the decline was caused by falling car production amid the uncertainty over leaving the EU. \u201cThere was also widespread weakness across manufacturing in April, as the boost from the early completion of orders ahead of the UK\u2019s original EU departure date has faded,\u201d he said. Manufacturing output across the country dropped by 3.9% on the month, driven by car production plunging by 24%. It comes after stronger growth in manufacturing in February and March, before falling back after the early completion of orders was not replaced and factories were closed to protect against potential Brexit disruption. While UK car manufacturers have struggled amid faltering demand for exports from China and elsewhere overseas as the world economy slows, and from tighter restrictions on diesel engines, several firms said they would temporarily halt activity due to Brexit, while some said they would ultimately close factories altogether, with thousands of job losses. Jaguar Land Rover staged a week-long factory shutdown as part of its plans for Brexit in April. BMW and Peugeot also brought forward annual maintenance stoppages that usually take place in the summer. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said earlier this month that car production fell by almost half in April, with an \u201cextraordinary\u201d drop from 127,970 cars rolling off production lines in April 2018 to 70,971 this year, a fall of 44.5%. Over the three months to April, the rate of growth slowed to 0.3% from 0.5% in the first three months of the year, when stockpiling had helped boost the economy.",

Instead of bonding as a family at home, she and her husband took up almost permanent residence in the neonatal intensive care unit, watching and waiting to see if their daughters would survive.</p> <p>Segal\u2019s diary of those first 56 days of her daughters\u2019 lives creates a compelling and emotionally taut exploration of what it means to be a parent in unexpected and challenging circumstances. From the opening pages, when Segal describes her feelings about the psychological aftermath of her C-section and the immediate removal of her babies to intensive care, we know we are in unflinching territory: \u201cTaking my unready daughters from within me felt not like a birth but an evisceration. They were elsewhere and in need of me and needing more than I could give them.\u201d</p> <p>Similarly, when she first meets her babies, a day later, the description is both visceral and heartrending: \u201cI can trace their circulation, the fine leaf-veining of tributaries clearly beneath their backs\u2019 translucent skin. The exquisite transgression of their forming selves, caught in the act of becoming.\u201d</p> <p>Segal, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/24/francesca-segal-innocents-review\" title=\"\">won the Costa first novel award</a> for her highly acclaimed debut, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/innocents-2.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Innocents</em></a>, brings a novelist\u2019s stylistic sensibility, a keen eye and a devastating honesty to events as they unfold. There is the moment when one of her daughters, at three days old, requires a canula and Segal cannot understand why there are so many medical staff present until the doctor explains that there is no pain relief given for the procedure and the staff are there to pin her baby down. There are infections that threaten not to be cured, intravenous lines that need to be taken out and readministered repeatedly and the discovery of holes in the babies\u2019 hearts.</p> <p>There is the quiet desolation of not being the first person to have dressed her babies and the suppression of pain from her C-section wound as she treks to and from the hospital. And there is the trauma of having to entrust the care of her children to others: \u201cLeaving my children each night is an amputation, over and over.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This room is nicknamed \u201cthe milking shed\u201d and here she meets a group of women whose support becomes invaluable</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And yet, amid the bleakness and despair, there is both light and warmth. In order to provide breast milk for their premature babies, a room is set aside in neonatal intensive care for the mothers to express milk that will then be administered to their sons and daughters in tiny, painstaking quantities.</p> <p>This room, Segal tells us, is nicknamed \u201cthe milking shed\u201d and here she meets a group of women whose support and guidance become invaluable. There is Sophie who \u201cwill spur me on like a sergeant. She will lift me up like an angel.\u201d There is Kemisha, a mother in her early 20s, who is the \u201cpack leader\u2026 vivid, with a furious, and furiously channelled, confidence\u201d.</p> <p>There is intense camaraderie between these women, the kind of fierce mutual support that stems from people who find themselves in adverse \u2013 often terrifying \u2013 circumstances.

      "bodyText": "When Francesca Segal\u2019s identical twin girls were born 10 weeks prematurely she found herself in a place far removed from the imagined, idealised early weeks of parenthood. Instead of bonding as a family at home, she and her husband took up almost permanent residence in the neonatal intensive care unit, watching and waiting to see if their daughters would survive. Segal\u2019s diary of those first 56 days of her daughters\u2019 lives creates a compelling and emotionally taut exploration of what it means to be a parent in unexpected and challenging circumstances. From the opening pages, when Segal describes her feelings about the psychological aftermath of her C-section and the immediate removal of her babies to intensive care, we know we are in unflinching territory: \u201cTaking my unready daughters from within me felt not like a birth but an evisceration. They were elsewhere and in need of me and needing more than I could give them.\u201d Similarly, when she first meets her babies, a day later, the description is both visceral and heartrending: \u201cI can trace their circulation, the fine leaf-veining of tributaries clearly beneath their backs\u2019 translucent skin. The exquisite transgression of their forming selves, caught in the act of becoming.\u201d Segal, who won the Costa first novel award for her highly acclaimed debut, The Innocents, brings a novelist\u2019s stylistic sensibility, a keen eye and a devastating honesty to events as they unfold. There is the moment when one of her daughters, at three days old, requires a canula and Segal cannot understand why there are so many medical staff present until the doctor explains that there is no pain relief given for the procedure and the staff are there to pin her baby down. There are infections that threaten not to be cured, intravenous lines that need to be taken out and readministered repeatedly and the discovery of holes in the babies\u2019 hearts. There is the quiet desolation of not being the first person to have dressed her babies and the suppression of pain from her C-section wound as she treks to and from the hospital. And there is the trauma of having to entrust the care of her children to others: \u201cLeaving my children each night is an amputation, over and over.\u201d And yet, amid the bleakness and despair, there is both light and warmth. In order to provide breast milk for their premature babies, a room is set aside in neonatal intensive care for the mothers to express milk that will then be administered to their sons and daughters in tiny, painstaking quantities. This room, Segal tells us, is nicknamed \u201cthe milking shed\u201d and here she meets a group of women whose support and guidance become invaluable. There is Sophie who \u201cwill spur me on like a sergeant. She will lift me up like an angel.\u201d There is Kemisha, a mother in her early 20s, who is the \u201cpack leader\u2026 vivid, with a furious, and furiously channelled, confidence\u201d. There is intense camaraderie between these women, the kind of fierce mutual support that stems from people who find themselves in adverse \u2013 often terrifying \u2013 circumstances. And sometimes there is laughter too: \u201cI wonder what they will make of this full-throated, indecent, intemperate laughter. Our greatest gift to one another is this\u2026 we are drawn back into the folds of the unremarkable.\u201d The pages of Mother Ship are filled with love, anguish, despair and hope in the face of adversity. As a memoir, it is both insightful and moving; as a diary of 56 days in neonatal care, it is an exquisitely written paean to motherhood. \u2022 Mother Ship by Francesca Segal is published by Vintage (\u00a314.99).

He goes on to explore many aspects of the \u201crogue state\u201d beyond that of the cellular rebellions of the body.

The verbal procedure seems to climax in graveyard humour about a nonexistent disease, listing \u201ceven the chance, however remote / of Rocky Mountain spotted fever\u201d, but it turns out that such a fever, tick-borne, really exists \u2013 and may be a killer.

It\u2019s as if Ozymandias lamented the dust pile he has become. No subtle, riddling Sphinx trips up the protagonist: this monster, in a powerful, brutal image simply has to shift an already \u201cblasted paw\u201d. The phrase \u201cdeceit of years\u201d is interesting: it suggests a delusion about the abundance of years imagined by an individual for themselves, and, perhaps, that all years will amount to nothing but sand grains. The word \u201cdeceit\u201d has the hiss of sand in it.</p> <p>If Shelley hovers here, in the next stanza we meet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43682/the-sick-rose\">the shadow of William Blake</a>. There\u2019s a brilliant mix of registers in the opening line-and-a-bit, sharpened by a well-judged line break: \u201cWhen did the heart fail the rose, I didn\u2019t see that / coming \u2026\u201d Refusing to reach a point of reconciliation, the speaker goes on to chart a graceless fall from the artist\u2019s special status.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the 90th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, on a hat\u2011trick, cuts inside his man and whacks it in the corner of the net to seal Portgual\u2019s 3-1 win against Switzerland in the Nations League. I am reporting pitchside for the Australian TV network Optus Sport. What an honour, to witness the second greatest player of the modern era shine so brightly in front of his adoring home support. Except I don\u2019t see it. As Ronaldo strikes the ball, I am sprinting down five flights of concrete steps. There is a lot of concrete in Porto\u2019s stadium and I am surrounded by it. A few flights behind is my co-presenter, the former Queens Park Rangers and Borussia Dortmund midfielder Ned Zelic. His fitness is not what it once was. We turn down a corridor. It\u2019s pitch black. I can\u2019t see a thing. I keep running. I try a heavy metal door. Locked. I try another. The same result. \u201cIt\u2019s the next one,\u201d cries Ned. He has caught up by now. He has never been to this ground before but somehow he knows. Perhaps it is instinct or perhaps you learn these things. I follow and before the final whistle we are in position, just by the pitch, ready to hurdle the advertising board and report back to the studio in Sydney, where among others John Aloisi is ready to hear our expert analysis of Ronaldo\u2019s goals. We scour Twitter and find a replay \u2013 it\u2019s a great goal, the hat\u2011trick goal. We had seen the other two \u2013 a classic free-kick and an excellent finish on the run. As soon as the second hit the net we had set off on our journey down to the pitch. And now we are here \u2013 ready to go. Producer Chris fires up the phone line and we\u2019re off. \u201cWhat a great strike for the hat-trick, Ned,\u201d I say. \u201cAbsolutely, Max. He struck it so well,\u201d he replies. I have always felt for the pitchside reporter \u2013 especially mid-game where their job seems only to confirm things we have seen. \u201cLooks like a calf strain, let\u2019s get the latest from Geoff pitch side.\u201d \u201cYep, I\u2019m watching the same game and, even though I\u2019m nearer than you, I\u2019m not close enough to ask him so it looks like a calf strain to me, too.\u201d See also substitutions. \u201cSo Kovacic replaces Barkley, let\u2019s just get confirmation of that.

But binge-watching TV shows now accounts for a sizeable share of sickies, as more people race through programmes than ever before. According to a Radio Times survey of 5,500 people, 18% said they had specifically called in sick so they could watch TV at home. The advent of the binge-watch came in 2013, when Netflix allowed viewers to watch the entire first series of House of Cards in one go \u2013 though it is unknown whether anyone actually raced through all the episodes in one marathon sitting. Since then, shows such as Orange is the New Black and Breaking Bad have done similar, with Black Mirror, Fleabag and Killing Eve following suit and appearing to radically alter TV-viewing patterns. Whether people in the UK are watching more TV than ever remains unclear, given the drastic shift in the way people watch shows, but people feel pressure to stay up to date with the latest programmes. Twenty-three percent of respondents confessed to having lied about seeing a programme in order to fit in because everyone else was talking about it. Meanwhile, half of TV viewers surveyed said they had binged more than eight hours of a show in one sitting, while three-quarters said they had binged more than four hours consecutively. That figure rose to 80% for those who attested to having lost sleep to keep watching a programme.

I thought I was dreaming, then I saw people in front of me pushing the door closed and I was like, \u2018Yo!\u2019\u201d Following his cancer diagnosis this year, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m afraid of dying, because \u2026 I died and came back already, in June 1991. I know what it\u2019s like on the other side.\u201d A Geto Boys reunion tour had been announced earlier this year, but was cancelled in late May. Bill\u2019s death was reported prematurely, with his son writing on Instagram on Sunday: \u201cMy dad IS NOT dead, he\u2019s still alive and fighting for his life. He needs your continued prayers and support. Certain people have been so quick to write him off as dead so they can capitalize off it.\u201d His publicist has confirmed he died later that evening.",

      "body": "<p><strong>USWNT\u2019s key player is \u2026</strong></p> <p>Julie Ertz. No one else in the squad offers the same physical disruption in central midfield, and the USWNT\u2019s defense, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/03/womens-world-cup-uswnt-soccer\">has looked shaky</a>, needs all the cover it can get. Her scoring ability on set pieces could also be the difference. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>Tempted to say Lindsey Horan but I\u2019m going to go with Becky Sauerbrunn. She\u2019s rightfully described as the soul of the team, and they\u2019ll need her experience and steadying influence both on- and off-the-field. At her best, she can bring calm and composure to a young defense, the rest of whom haven\u2019t competed in a World Cup before, barring Ali Krieger. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>Megan Rapinoe. She is a key playmaker, is lethal on set plays, and has an unapologetic drive and energy that fuels her teammates. She has played with some of the top players in the world, and her experience gives her the ability to read the game and act accordingly. \u2018Pinoe\u2019 also often acts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/mar/25/megan-rapinoe-gay-woman-person-color-us\">as the moral compass of this team</a>. And that makes her even more powerful. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>Becky Sauerbrunn. The old joke about Roberto Carlos \u2013 that left-back wasn\u2019t his address but the place he could be found in case of emergency \u2013 applies to both full-backs. Aside from them, the only defender who has played in a major tournament is surprise call-up Ali Krieger. Sauerbrunn, criminally omitted from 2015 post-Cup honors, will need to be the cornerstone at the back once again. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>Unheralded USWNT player to watch \u2026</strong></p> <p>There isn\u2019t much attention on Rose Lavelle because this is her first major tournament. But her creativity in midfield could be crucial if the USWNT\u2019s usual approach from the flanks is unsuccessful. Lavelle is the only playmaking No10 on the roster who can pull the strings in the attack. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s hard to pick an unheralded player in a team of all-stars so I\u2019m going to go with somebody who is <em>currently</em> unheralded in Carli Lloyd. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/07/carli-lloyd-uswnt-soccer-womens-world-cup\">She\u2019s going into this tournament as a sub</a> due to her age but she\u2019s incredibly focused, hard-working and still has the capacity to come on and change a game with a moment of brilliance. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>Jessica McDonald. The US have notable talent up front (Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath) but McDonald has a point to make. She is bold, and I love that. She\u2019s the only mother on this squad, and has worked relentlessly to get better, and be noticed. She brings a confidence to the pitch that tells us she has nothing to lose. She is ready. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>Rose Lavelle. The US have never been known for playmaking midfielders, but they have one now. In the NWSL, where wily veterans typically humble incoming draftees, Lavelle was a rare immediate-impact rookie before injury trouble struck. If the USA face a bunker, as they did in the fateful 2016 Olympics loss to Sweden, she\u2019ll be the key to unlocking it. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>USWNT\u2019s biggest weakness</strong> \u2026</p> <p>Defense, defense, defense. When the USWNT have faced teams ranked in the world top 10 this year, they have conceded multiple goals <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/27/womens-world-cup-2019-uswnt-defending-champions\">on all but one occasion</a>. The USWNT attack is potent, but the forwards will have to work extra hard to make up for all the goals the USWNT looks poised to concede. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>At the back. The defense has looked a little shaky at times, particularly against other big teams. It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve quite gelled and I think part of that is a lack of experience. On top of that, Briana Scurry and Hope Solo set an incredibly high bar in goal and Alyssa Naeher will need to keep a cool head and put in some great performances to reassure the players around her. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>Overconfidence. The USWNT have a tendency to hold to notions of what they were, not what they are. They are not the youngest team out there, and did not perform well at the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. I am pleased they have huge support from their fans but that doesn\u2019t always lend itself to humility. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>Depth at the back. The puzzling roster decision wasn\u2019t Ali Krieger over Casey Short, a capable left-back. It was Jessica McDonald, a seventh forward, over Short, who could give Crystal Dunn a break or a chance to play in the attack. Meanwhile, in goal, starter Alyssa Naeher has been shaky this year, and third-stringer Adrianna Franch didn\u2019t make her debut until March. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>The biggest threat to the US \u2026</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ac751967d72d9a5738d8b332ef9c356b71ad93e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ac751967d72d9a5738d8b332ef9c356b71ad93e/0_257_4410_2646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US are set to play a dangerous France team in the quarter-finals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US are set to play a dangerous France team in the quarter-finals.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Grimm/Bongarts/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>France. The host country have a supremely talented group and are widely considered the favorite of this tournament. Unfortunately for the USWNT, the draw has put the Americans on a collision course to face France in the quarter-finals, which could spell the USA\u2019s earliest exit in a World Cup. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>France. They carved the USWNT apart in the pre-tournament friendly, they\u2019re on home soil and look extremely dangerous. What they lack in experience, they make up for in fluid, dynamic attacking play. They\u2019re a team who can sit back and soak up the pressure, then produce clinical finishes on the break. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>There are plenty of threats out there. This year they have been beaten by France and faced tough battles against England, Australia and Japan. They also rely heavily on physicality and not necessarily technical skill. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>The cruelty of the World Cup draw is that the USA will likely face bona fide contender France in the quarter-finals. The hosts routed the USA (admittedly rusty in the NWSL offseason) in January, and they have a strong mix of experience and youth. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>One bold prediction</strong> \u2026</p> <p>There\u2019s no good reason to think Spain will make a run in this World Cup. They only qualified for the first time in 2015 and were knocked out in the group stage. And conventional wisdom says they lack necessary depth. But World Cups are for chaos and what Spain lack in talent they may make up for in having an identity. Plus, keep an eye on goalscorer Jenni Hermoso. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>This is very bold, but I think Thailand may hold the USWNT to a draw in their opening fixture. They held Australia to a shock draw in the semi-finals of the Asian Cup last year, only to lose on penalties. It\u2019s a huge tournament, all eyes are on the reigning champions and all that scrutiny could cause an upset in their opening game. If the forwards aren\u2019t on their game and they don\u2019t score early, the pressure of the occasion could produce a shock. Unlikely, but possible. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>Despite their opening loss to Italy, Australia will get to the final, because Sam Kerr is flanked by a squad that often gets unnoticed as they toil Down Under. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>The ticket fiasco is the last domino to fall for Fifa. Western Europe, North America and a few South American and Asian countries form their own soccer federation, and we endure a decade of dueling international organizers before everything is resolved. Hey, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/oct/29/chess.features\">it worked for chess</a>, more or less. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>Will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/08/usa-womens-team-sues-us-soccer-pay-equality\">the USWNT\u2019s gender discrimination lawsuit</a> affect their campaign?</strong></p> <p>If the USWNT falter in this World Cup, it will be because women\u2019s soccer is more competitive than ever before. What I learned in researching and writing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/National-Team-Inside-Dreamed-Changed/dp/1419734490/\">my book</a> on the USWNT, is that they have been in these sorts of off-field battles continuously over the years. In the past it just happened a lot more privately. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>If they don\u2019t win, it\u2019s what some lazy pundits will suggest but no. The battle between the USWNT and US Soccer for fair pay has been ongoing for decades, just in different forms. Now it\u2019s a legal matter. That US Soccer continues to undervalue and undermine its most successful team is an embarrassment. There\u2019s no loophole or pernickety justifications of pay structure that can justify this persistent inequality. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>Much to their credit, the USWNT have been champions despite the incompetence of US Soccer. There is a part of me \u2013 albeit, as a Canadian, a very small part \u2013 that hopes they win everything to spite the people who will not give them proper remuneration. These women deserve everything that America can give them. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>Not at all. The team\u2019s veteran leadership, especially US Soccer Athletes\u2019 Council member Sauerbrunn, won\u2019t let that happen. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><strong>USWNT\u2019s campaign will end with ...</strong></p> <p>The realistic expectation is that the US should make it to the semi-finals, because that has always been the standard. But after years of asking whether the world has caught up to the USWNT, I think this could be the year we finally see it happen and the US exit in the quarter-final, which would be their worst World Cup ever. <strong>CM</strong></p> <p>Defeat in the semi-finals. Possibly to a heartbreaking, last-minute goal or a questionable refereeing decision. I feel like the USWNT have benefitted from some of those over the years and the football gods tend to exact their revenge every once in a while. <strong>GC</strong></p> <p>They\u2019ll ease through their group but the reigning champions will not advance beyond the quarter finals. The competition is very, very tough. Which makes this the most exciting World Cup yet. <strong>SA</strong></p> <p>Misguided takes from US pundits who pay attention only when the spotlight is on. Depending on results, that could be \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they take Hope Solo?\u201d or \u201cWhen will Congress intervene?\u201d Or maybe \u201cThey won, so why won\u2019t they get paid more,\u201d not realizing that they will. We don\u2019t know all the CBA details, but winning matters.</p> <p>Oh, and they\u2019ll win it. They\u2019ll get past France in extra-time, beat England 3-2 in the semi-finals and take the final 4-1 over Australia, who won\u2019t be able to build on the momentum of ousting Germany in the semis. <strong>BD</strong></p> <p><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "USWNT\u2019s key player is \u2026 Julie Ertz. No one else in the squad offers the same physical disruption in central midfield, and the USWNT\u2019s defense, which has looked shaky, needs all the cover it can get. Her scoring ability on set pieces could also be the difference. CM Tempted to say Lindsey Horan but I\u2019m going to go with Becky Sauerbrunn. She\u2019s rightfully described as the soul of the team, and they\u2019ll need her experience and steadying influence both on- and off-the-field. At her best, she can bring calm and composure to a young defense, the rest of whom haven\u2019t competed in a World Cup before, barring Ali Krieger. GC Megan Rapinoe. She is a key playmaker, is lethal on set plays, and has an unapologetic drive and energy that fuels her teammates. She has played with some of the top players in the world, and her experience gives her the ability to read the game and act accordingly. \u2018Pinoe\u2019 also often acts as the moral compass of this team. And that makes her even more powerful. SA Becky Sauerbrunn. The old joke about Roberto Carlos \u2013 that left-back wasn\u2019t his address but the place he could be found in case of emergency \u2013 applies to both full-backs. Aside from them, the only defender who has played in a major tournament is surprise call-up Ali Krieger. Sauerbrunn, criminally omitted from 2015 post-Cup honors, will need to be the cornerstone at the back once again. BD Unheralded USWNT player to watch \u2026 There isn\u2019t much attention on Rose Lavelle because this is her first major tournament. But her creativity in midfield could be crucial if the USWNT\u2019s usual approach from the flanks is unsuccessful. Lavelle is the only playmaking No10 on the roster who can pull the strings in the attack. CM It\u2019s hard to pick an unheralded player in a team of all-stars so I\u2019m going to go with somebody who is currently unheralded in Carli Lloyd. She\u2019s going into this tournament as a sub due to her age but she\u2019s incredibly focused, hard-working and still has the capacity to come on and change a game with a moment of brilliance. GC Jessica McDonald. The US have notable talent up front (Alex Morgan and Tobin Heath) but McDonald has a point to make. She is bold, and I love that. She\u2019s the only mother on this squad, and has worked relentlessly to get better, and be noticed. She brings a confidence to the pitch that tells us she has nothing to lose. She is ready. SA Rose Lavelle. The US have never been known for playmaking midfielders, but they have one now. In the NWSL, where wily veterans typically humble incoming draftees, Lavelle was a rare immediate-impact rookie before injury trouble struck. If the USA face a bunker, as they did in the fateful 2016 Olympics loss to Sweden, she\u2019ll be the key to unlocking it. BD USWNT\u2019s biggest weakness \u2026 Defense, defense, defense. When the USWNT have faced teams ranked in the world top 10 this year, they have conceded multiple goals on all but one occasion. The USWNT attack is potent, but the forwards will have to work extra hard to make up for all the goals the USWNT looks poised to concede. CM At the back. The defense has looked a little shaky at times, particularly against other big teams. It doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019ve quite gelled and I think part of that is a lack of experience. On top of that, Briana Scurry and Hope Solo set an incredibly high bar in goal and Alyssa Naeher will need to keep a cool head and put in some great performances to reassure the players around her. GC Overconfidence. The USWNT have a tendency to hold to notions of what they were, not what they are. They are not the youngest team out there, and did not perform well at the SheBelieves Cup earlier this year. I am pleased they have huge support from their fans but that doesn\u2019t always lend itself to humility. SA Depth at the back. The puzzling roster decision wasn\u2019t Ali Krieger over Casey Short, a capable left-back. It was Jessica McDonald, a seventh forward, over Short, who could give Crystal Dunn a break or a chance to play in the attack. Meanwhile, in goal, starter Alyssa Naeher has been shaky this year, and third-stringer Adrianna Franch didn\u2019t make her debut until March. BD The biggest threat to the US \u2026 France. The host country have a supremely talented group and are widely considered the favorite of this tournament. Unfortunately for the USWNT, the draw has put the Americans on a collision course to face France in the quarter-finals, which could spell the USA\u2019s earliest exit in a World Cup. CM France. They carved the USWNT apart in the pre-tournament friendly, they\u2019re on home soil and look extremely dangerous. What they lack in experience, they make up for in fluid, dynamic attacking play. They\u2019re a team who can sit back and soak up the pressure, then produce clinical finishes on the break. GC There are plenty of threats out there. This year they have been beaten by France and faced tough battles against England, Australia and Japan. They also rely heavily on physicality and not necessarily technical skill. SA The cruelty of the World Cup draw is that the USA will likely face bona fide contender France in the quarter-finals. The hosts routed the USA (admittedly rusty in the NWSL offseason) in January, and they have a strong mix of experience and youth. BD One bold prediction \u2026 There\u2019s no good reason to think Spain will make a run in this World Cup. They only qualified for the first time in 2015 and were knocked out in the group stage. And conventional wisdom says they lack necessary depth. But World Cups are for chaos and what Spain lack in talent they may make up for in having an identity. Plus, keep an eye on goalscorer Jenni Hermoso. CM This is very bold, but I think Thailand may hold the USWNT to a draw in their opening fixture. They held Australia to a shock draw in the semi-finals of the Asian Cup last year, only to lose on penalties. It\u2019s a huge tournament, all eyes are on the reigning champions and all that scrutiny could cause an upset in their opening game. If the forwards aren\u2019t on their game and they don\u2019t score early, the pressure of the occasion could produce a shock. Unlikely, but possible. GC Despite their opening loss to Italy, Australia will get to the final, because Sam Kerr is flanked by a squad that often gets unnoticed as they toil Down Under. SA The ticket fiasco is the last domino to fall for Fifa. Western Europe, North America and a few South American and Asian countries form their own soccer federation, and we endure a decade of dueling international organizers before everything is resolved. Hey, it worked for chess, more or less. BD Will the USWNT\u2019s gender discrimination lawsuit affect their campaign? If the USWNT falter in this World Cup, it will be because women\u2019s soccer is more competitive than ever before. What I learned in researching and writing my book on the USWNT, is that they have been in these sorts of off-field battles continuously over the years. In the past it just happened a lot more privately. CM If they don\u2019t win, it\u2019s what some lazy pundits will suggest but no. The battle between the USWNT and US Soccer for fair pay has been ongoing for decades, just in different forms. Now it\u2019s a legal matter. That US Soccer continues to undervalue and undermine its most successful team is an embarrassment. There\u2019s no loophole or pernickety justifications of pay structure that can justify this persistent inequality. GC Much to their credit, the USWNT have been champions despite the incompetence of US Soccer. There is a part of me \u2013 albeit, as a Canadian, a very small part \u2013 that hopes they win everything to spite the people who will not give them proper remuneration. These women deserve everything that America can give them. SA Not at all. The team\u2019s veteran leadership, especially US Soccer Athletes\u2019 Council member Sauerbrunn, won\u2019t let that happen. BD USWNT\u2019s campaign will end with ... The realistic expectation is that the US should make it to the semi-finals, because that has always been the standard. But after years of asking whether the world has caught up to the USWNT, I think this could be the year we finally see it happen and the US exit in the quarter-final, which would be their worst World Cup ever. CM Defeat in the semi-finals. Possibly to a heartbreaking, last-minute goal or a questionable refereeing decision. I feel like the USWNT have benefitted from some of those over the years and the football gods tend to exact their revenge every once in a while. GC They\u2019ll ease through their group but the reigning champions will not advance beyond the quarter finals. The competition is very, very tough. Which makes this the most exciting World Cup yet. SA Misguided takes from US pundits who pay attention only when the spotlight is on. Depending on results, that could be \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they take Hope Solo?\u201d or \u201cWhen will Congress intervene?\u201d Or maybe \u201cThey won, so why won\u2019t they get paid more,\u201d not realizing that they will. We don\u2019t know all the CBA details, but winning matters. Oh, and they\u2019ll win it. They\u2019ll get past France in extra-time, beat England 3-2 in the semi-finals and take the final 4-1 over Australia, who won\u2019t be able to build on the momentum of ousting Germany in the semis.

Amid the stand-off between the Coalition and Labor over the government\u2019s key election pledge, the passage of the legislation could come down to crossbench senators who are leaving open the possibility of supporting the plan. On Monday, Pauline Hanson indicated she would oppose the third stage of the government\u2019s $158bn tax cut package, saying she was \u201cnot sold\u201d on the economic argument of the boost for higher income earners. She called on the government to prioritise \u201cnation-building\u201d projects, naming a coal-fired power station, the Bradfield water scheme first proposed in the 1930s and a royal commission into the family courts system as key to her support. \u201cI strongly believe the people of Australia gave One Nation the shared balance-of-power responsibility to ensure this government starts constructing nation-building projects,\u201d Hanson said. \u201cIf there are three things I want to achieve before leaving parliament, the government now know what they are.\u201d The Coalition is on track to hold 35 seats in the new Senate when parliament returns in July, and needs 39 votes to secure the majority needed to pass legislation. If it gains the support of conservative Cory Bernardi, the Coalition will still need to secure three more votes from the Senate crossbench, expected to comprise Jacqui Lambie, and two senators from each of One Nation and Centre Alliance. Centre Alliance has offered the Coalition a lifeline, suggesting that the minor party \u201cwould love to give hardworking Australians a tax cut\u201d if it was confident income tax rebates would not cause cuts to services down the line. It is awaiting briefings from Treasury and the Reserve Bank of Australia. While the government is still hopeful of securing a deal with minor parties, the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, called on the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, to abandon the \u201cpolitics of envy\u201d and side with the government to pass the tax cuts into law. \u201cWill he just persist with Labor\u2019s failed politics of envy, which was so comprehensively rejected by the Australian people at the last election, by standing in the way of the income tax relief that Australians voted for?

      "bodyText": "Selecting Boris Johnson or another hard Brexiter to be Conservative party leader is a vote for an early general election, Amber Rudd has warned as the crowded contest finally begins in earnest. The work and pensions secretary, who has announced she is backing Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, to succeed Theresa May, criticised Johnson\u2019s trenchant attitude towards leaving the EU on 31 October, saying: \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not enough if you haven\u2019t got a plan behind it.\u201d Promises by Johnson, Dominic Raab and Esther McVey to leave without a deal if, as seems likely, the EU refuses to renegotiate the UK\u2019s departure deal, would be blocked by MPs and end up triggering an election, Rudd said. Asked if a vote for a no-deal candidate was, in effect, a vote for an early election, Rudd told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cIn my view it is.\u201d She said: \u201cMembers of parliament will find a way to stop no deal and I think that any aspiring leader needs to factor that in. \u201cI think there could be an election \u2013 parliament is a very creative place, and with the assistance of an activist Speaker there will be a way that MPs will find in order to have their voice heard.\u201d After May formally tendered her resignation on Friday, Hunt, Raab, the former Brexit secretary, and Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will launch their leadership bids on Monday. Nominations for the post close at 5pm, by which point candidates must have gained at least eight nominations to proceed to the first round of voting. With 11 MPs standing, the expectation is that some will fail to reach the threshold. Johnson is the clear favourite, with other leading contenders including Hunt, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, and Michael Gove, the environment secretary. Gove\u2019s chances are regarded to have been badly hit after he revealed he took cocaine while he was working as a journalist and advocating robust measures against drug use. Rudd said her decision to back Hunt came after the One Nation group of Tory MPs, of which she is part, held hustings events for candidates last week. \u201cBy the end of that double two-hour session it was clear to me that Jeremy was going to be the best person to solve the impasse,\u201d Rudd said. \u201cWe need somebody who faces up to the challenges that we have, who\u2019s not just going to say: \u2018Believe in Britain, it\u2019ll be fine\u2019, but has the experience and the plan to try and heal those divisions and actually bring us to Brexit as soon as possible.\u201d While Johnson had \u201cmany great things\u201d about him, Rudd said, his plans for Brexit were too vague: \u201cTo me, it\u2019s not enough to say, we\u2019re definitely leaving by 31 October without addressing how you\u2019re going to resolve it.\u201d She also criticised Johnson\u2019s plan, announced overnight, to slash the higher rate of income tax: \u201cIf you want to badge yourself as a one-nation Conservative you focus on tax cuts and investment in infrastructure to help the lowest paid and people in most difficulty in all parts of this country. That\u2019s not what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Among the outsiders standing for the role is Andrea Leadsom, who recently resigned as leader of the Commons. While she has so far received only four public pledges of support, Leadsom said she was confident of gaining the eight needed. She also expressed doubt at Johnson\u2019s tax plans, saying he had not taken account of the difficulties of passing legislation without an outright Conservative majority: \u201cI think in reality, in this parliament, it would be impossible to actually get wholesale tax changes through.\u201d Leadsom termed her Brexit proposal a \u201cmanaged exit\u201d, a variant on no deal in which she would persuade the EU and parliament to agree some basic issues over citizens\u2019 rights and other areas. However, she dismissed the idea floated by Raab of proroguing, or suspending, parliament in order to prevent MPs blocking a no-deal departure in October. \u201cWe live in a parliamentary democracy, and bringing the Queen in and trying to do something that shuts down our parliamentary democracy would be entirely wrong.\u201d",

How old is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-douglas\">Michael Douglas</a>? How old is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/arnold-schwarzenegger\">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>? Looking at their movies these days, it is impossible to tell. All three have recently submitted to the digital de-ageing process (in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/05/captain-marvel-review-brie-larson-samuel-l-jackson\">Captain Marvel</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/23/avengers-endgame-review-unconquerable-brilliance-takes-marvel-to-new-heights\">Avengers Endgame</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/30/action-heroines-linda-hamilton-terminator\">Terminator: Dark Fate</a>, respectively), and the technology, which makes an actor look younger, is now so good, and so ubiquitous, that things are getting confusing. Watching a 30-years-younger Jackson in Captain Marvel, you might have had to check yourself and say: \u201cWait, I knew Sam Jackson looked good for a 70-year-old, but not <em>that</em> good.\u201d</p> <p>Digital de-ageing is a great tool to have in the box, of course, and film-makers are having fun with it. Ang Lee\u2019s forthcoming Gemini Man pits a grey, grizzled Will Smith against a younger version of himself. And even old dog Martin Scorsese has been making use of this new trick for his latest, The Irishman. According to Scorsese, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/shortcuts/2019/may/29/hollywood-de-aging-digitally-martin-scorsese-will-smith-anthony-hopkins-robert-downey-de-niro-pacino\">the tech is still not quite there</a>. He recently revealed he had to delay the movie because the \u201cyouthification\u201d \u2013 as he called it \u2013 of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci was not good enough. Having known these actors most of their lives, Scorsese wasn\u2019t convinced by their young, CGI-assisted faces, wondering in a podcast: \u201cDoes it change the eyes at all? If that\u2019s the case, what was in the eyes that I liked? Was it intensity? Was it gravitas?

      "bodyText": "How old is Samuel L Jackson? How old is Michael Douglas? How old is Arnold Schwarzenegger? Looking at their movies these days, it is impossible to tell. All three have recently submitted to the digital de-ageing process (in Captain Marvel, Avengers Endgame and Terminator: Dark Fate, respectively), and the technology, which makes an actor look younger, is now so good, and so ubiquitous, that things are getting confusing. Watching a 30-years-younger Jackson in Captain Marvel, you might have had to check yourself and say: \u201cWait, I knew Sam Jackson looked good for a 70-year-old, but not that good.\u201d Digital de-ageing is a great tool to have in the box, of course, and film-makers are having fun with it. Ang Lee\u2019s forthcoming Gemini Man pits a grey, grizzled Will Smith against a younger version of himself. And even old dog Martin Scorsese has been making use of this new trick for his latest, The Irishman. According to Scorsese, the tech is still not quite there. He recently revealed he had to delay the movie because the \u201cyouthification\u201d \u2013 as he called it \u2013 of Robert De Niro, Al Pacino and Joe Pesci was not good enough. Having known these actors most of their lives, Scorsese wasn\u2019t convinced by their young, CGI-assisted faces, wondering in a podcast: \u201cDoes it change the eyes at all? If that\u2019s the case, what was in the eyes that I liked? Was it intensity? Was it gravitas? Was it threat?\u201d Leaving aside the fact that this technology seems to be being applied to men more than women (in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it was used to make Hayley Atwell 60 years older), there is the question of whether it\u2019s really good for the movies. Might it tempt actors to stick with the \u201cyouthified\u201d version, even when it\u2019s not in a flashback? How much is that happening already? And if you\u2019ve grafted, say, young Arnie\u2019s face on to the torso of a young body double, can you really say it\u2019s Schwarzenegger at all?

      "bodyText": "If long, protracted transfer battles involving high-priced whelps are your jam, Benfica\u2019s Jo\u00e3o Felix looks set to provide much of the soundtrack to the summer with Juventus, Manchester City, Real Madrid and Manchester United all gazing on longingly. Stakes have been (infinitesimally) raised over the weekend and United are now, apparently, in discussions with the 19-year-old, who has a release clause of \u20ac120m. Not to be outdone, City are said to have offered him a \u00a326.6m deal for the next five years. It\u2019s likely that United will be chiefly involved in this summer\u2019s other transfer banger too \u2013 whether or not Christian Eriksen leaves Tottenham. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r sees him as an ideal Paul Pogba replacement, but isn\u2019t averse to a bit of Youri Tielemans either. Meanwhile, the club have had a \u00a340m bid for Aaron Wan-Bissaka laughed out of Selhurst Park and have been told to return with nearer \u00a360m. Tottenham will spend all summer trying to drive the price of Ryan Sessegnon down from the \u00a345m Fulham want to the 45p Daniel Levy is prepared to spend. Danny Rose may or may not still be at the club at the end of it, having offered his latest statement of wholehearted commitment to Spurs. \u201cIf I\u2019m back at Tottenham next season, great, if I\u2019m not \u2013 great,\u201d he cheered. Arsenal have had to somewhat lower their transfer expectations since going awol in Baku but are still sniffing around PSG\u2019s polo-neck-wearing, chin-stroking, art-loving right-back Thomas Meunier. They\u2019re having a peek at Fiorentina midfielder Jordan Veretout as well, and as a retro nod to former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, have their eyes on an 18-year Ligue 1 defender \u2013 in this case, St Etienne\u2019s William Saliba. They\u2019ll also have a tussle with Spurs and West Ham over Atalanta midfielder Franck Kessie, currently on loan at Milan. Banned from buying any players, Chelsea are nevertheless keen to get in on the transfer act so have been lurking outside Leverkusen to wink at Jamaica\u2019s \u00a380m man Leon Bailey. When they are not allowed to complete that transfer, they will turn their attention to Ajax\u2019s Brazilian forward David Neres, who Fifa will also not let them sign.

      "body": "<h2>Monday</h2> <p>This morning starts off with a child protection meeting about a family who are struggling to meet their young child\u2019s needs. The parents have not turned up and the social worker reports that the father is rumoured to be back on drugs. My heart sinks. I have worked hard to support the family over the past few months and I thought the father was doing well and attending addiction therapy. Could I have done something different?</p> <h2>Tuesday</h2> <p>During clinic today, I see 11 mothers and their young children. Reminding parents that they are doing a great job gives me a wonderful sense of satisfaction.</p> <p>As I am packing up, a mother comes in; she seems anxious. I ask her if everything is OK. She begins to cry and reveals that she has fled her abusive partner and is sofa surfing at a friend\u2019s house. I tell her I\u2019m in awe of how brave she is.</p> <p>I give her my work phone number and contact details for Women\u2019s Aid and arrange to see her later this week. I ask her permission to speak to social services, as I am duty bound to do. I explain it is not to report her, but we need to establish that she and her baby will be safe.</p> <p>She agrees and leaves clutching her baby tightly. I can\u2019t stop thinking about her for the rest of the day, worrying that she will go back to her abusive partner. I wish I had more time to spend with her, but I have three more visits to do today.</p> <h2>Wednesday</h2> <p>I do a mood assessment on a mother with a six-week-old baby. She is struggling with her mental health and transitioning into parenthood. I encourage her to attend our local postnatal depression support group and arrange to see her next week.</p> <p>I do two more visits, write up my notes and make calls.</p> <h2>Thursday</h2> <p>I visit a mother who is having trouble bonding with her newborn baby following a traumatic birth. She reveals the distress she felt when her baby was born blue and did not breathe. She cries as she admits that she struggles to hold him in case he dies in her arms.</p> <p>I see how desperate she is for someone to tell her she is doing OK. An overwhelming sense of sadness comes over me as I consider how difficult motherhood is \u2013 the crippling guilt, the weight of feeling like you\u2019re not doing enough, and the reality of it that it isn\u2019t like the pictures you see on social media. </p> <h2>Friday</h2> <p>I visit a family who have got themselves into rent arrears and debt following the change over to universal credit. They had a visit from the bailiffs this week and now can\u2019t feed their family of five.</p> <p>I write out a food bank voucher, offer to refer them to a debt management agency, and arrange to call them next week. I feel a sense of despair that there is nothing more I can do to help them, and I\u2019m angry at the government for putting them in this position. Six weeks without any income leads to rent arrears and unpaid bills, and ultimately the ones who suffer are the children.</p> <p>I have a case conference with a family who have been neglecting their children. The professionals have to decide whether the children are at risk of significant harm. Sadly, most agree they are. The father shouts at us and the mother just sobs. I am upset that it has come to this.</p> <p>I look forward to going home and spending the weekend with my three children, but first I have more paperwork, phone calls and emails to answer. I get home after 6pm. I\u2019m a single parent, and feel awful that I have to spread my time so thinly between my own family and the ones I work with.</p> <p><em>If you would like to contribute to our My working week series about your job in public services, get in touch by emailing <a href=\"mailto:sarah.johnson@theguardian.com\">sarah.johnson@theguardian.com</a></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Monday This morning starts off with a child protection meeting about a family who are struggling to meet their young child\u2019s needs. The parents have not turned up and the social worker reports that the father is rumoured to be back on drugs. My heart sinks. I have worked hard to support the family over the past few months and I thought the father was doing well and attending addiction therapy. Could I have done something different? Tuesday During clinic today, I see 11 mothers and their young children. Reminding parents that they are doing a great job gives me a wonderful sense of satisfaction. As I am packing up, a mother comes in; she seems anxious. I ask her if everything is OK. She begins to cry and reveals that she has fled her abusive partner and is sofa surfing at a friend\u2019s house. I tell her I\u2019m in awe of how brave she is. I give her my work phone number and contact details for Women\u2019s Aid and arrange to see her later this week. I ask her permission to speak to social services, as I am duty bound to do. I explain it is not to report her, but we need to establish that she and her baby will be safe. She agrees and leaves clutching her baby tightly. I can\u2019t stop thinking about her for the rest of the day, worrying that she will go back to her abusive partner. I wish I had more time to spend with her, but I have three more visits to do today. Wednesday I do a mood assessment on a mother with a six-week-old baby. She is struggling with her mental health and transitioning into parenthood. I encourage her to attend our local postnatal depression support group and arrange to see her next week. I do two more visits, write up my notes and make calls. Thursday I visit a mother who is having trouble bonding with her newborn baby following a traumatic birth. She reveals the distress she felt when her baby was born blue and did not breathe. She cries as she admits that she struggles to hold him in case he dies in her arms. I see how desperate she is for someone to tell her she is doing OK. An overwhelming sense of sadness comes over me as I consider how difficult motherhood is \u2013 the crippling guilt, the weight of feeling like you\u2019re not doing enough, and the reality of it that it isn\u2019t like the pictures you see on social media. Friday I visit a family who have got themselves into rent arrears and debt following the change over to universal credit. They had a visit from the bailiffs this week and now can\u2019t feed their family of five. I write out a food bank voucher, offer to refer them to a debt management agency, and arrange to call them next week. I feel a sense of despair that there is nothing more I can do to help them, and I\u2019m angry at the government for putting them in this position. Six weeks without any income leads to rent arrears and unpaid bills, and ultimately the ones who suffer are the children. I have a case conference with a family who have been neglecting their children. The professionals have to decide whether the children are at risk of significant harm. Sadly, most agree they are. The father shouts at us and the mother just sobs. I am upset that it has come to this. I look forward to going home and spending the weekend with my three children, but first I have more paperwork, phone calls and emails to answer. I get home after 6pm. I\u2019m a single parent, and feel awful that I have to spread my time so thinly between my own family and the ones I work with.

If peak Tiger Woods was the year 2000, nothing emphasised his dominance more than the battering of Pebble Beach into submission.</p> <p>A glance at the final leaderboard from the US Open of 19 years ago makes as staggering reading now as was ever the case: -12 T Woods, +3 M \u00c1 Jim\u00e9nez/E Els, +4 J Huston. Woods\u2019s worst round of the week was 71 in an event where seven over par was sufficient to earn a top-10 finish. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever see a performance as dominant as that again,\u201d said Rory McIlroy of Woods\u2019s Pebble procession.</p> <p>Woods, now a 15-times major winner, need not necessarily draw upon 2000 as the US Open makes a return to the Monterey Peninsula from Thursday. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/14/masters-tiger-woods-molinari-finau-schauffele-koepka\" title=\"\">The 43-year-old\u2019s success at the Masters </a>in April supplied proof that he can still prevail on the greatest stages.

Pebble, 2000, he never drove the ball better than he did that year, long and straight. He had unbelievable distance control with his irons and he was holing putts. He did everything he needed to do.</p> <p>\u201cGolf can feel pretty easy when it\u2019s like that. Maybe not to that same level, I\u2019ve played tournaments and played well where the back nine has been comfortable and you\u2019ve been able to sort of let it sink in. But to win by 15? It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d</p> <p>Woods looked short of health and/or fitness when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/may/18/tiger-woods-us-pga-rust-thrown-into-sharp-relief-by-brooks-koepkas-power\" title=\"\">missing the cut at last month\u2019s US PGA Championship</a>. The specifics of the Masters champion\u2019s scenario, typically, were shrouded in mystery; Woods admitted to illness on the day before the tournament began, as it curtailed his practice. His mood and form were improved by early June\u2019s Memorial Tournament, where he finished tied ninth.</p> <p>The scale of the achievement within view for Brooks Koepka is illustrated by the fact that a US Open treble was last completed in 1905, when Scotsman Willie Anderson won a third in a row. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/19/brooks-koepka-wins-us-pga-dustin-johnson\" title=\"\">Koepka\u2019s victory at that US PGA Championship</a>, at Bethpage Black, extended his superb run to four major wins inside 23 months. \u201cThat name [Anderson] has come up a lot this year,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI know what I\u2019m chasing or trying to accomplish.

Brooks has done it better than anyone else over the last couple of years.</p> <p>\u201cHe knows what he needs to do and he seems to get his game, mind and body coming together for those big weeks. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all looking to have happen, but he\u2019s figured out what\u2019s best for him.\u201d</p> <p>Koepka\u2019s prediction of a stern challenge looks apt, with photography from recent days at Pebble Beach showing extremely dense rough. With that comes a premium on driving accuracy; as suits Koepka and McIlroy, if not, in theory, Woods. Nick Faldo branded the rough mega-thick with an added warning that this \u201cstifles the creativity\u201d of players. The USGA, beset by bad publicity in recent times in direct relation to the US Open, can barely afford another week of negativity.</p> <p>Pebble Beach was once Dustin Johnson territory.

      "bodyText": "They were the best of times within the best of times. If peak Tiger Woods was the year 2000, nothing emphasised his dominance more than the battering of Pebble Beach into submission. A glance at the final leaderboard from the US Open of 19 years ago makes as staggering reading now as was ever the case: -12 T Woods, +3 M \u00c1 Jim\u00e9nez/E Els, +4 J Huston. Woods\u2019s worst round of the week was 71 in an event where seven over par was sufficient to earn a top-10 finish. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll ever see a performance as dominant as that again,\u201d said Rory McIlroy of Woods\u2019s Pebble procession. Woods, now a 15-times major winner, need not necessarily draw upon 2000 as the US Open makes a return to the Monterey Peninsula from Thursday. The 43-year-old\u2019s success at the Masters in April supplied proof that he can still prevail on the greatest stages. Still, a degree of flashback is inevitable. That particular performance, which delivered Woods\u2019s third major win, was extraordinary even by the standards of a phenomenal sportsman. \u201cHe probably led the field in every single statistical category,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cI\u2019m sure he was up there in distance and driving accuracy. Pebble, 2000, he never drove the ball better than he did that year, long and straight. He had unbelievable distance control with his irons and he was holing putts. He did everything he needed to do. \u201cGolf can feel pretty easy when it\u2019s like that. Maybe not to that same level, I\u2019ve played tournaments and played well where the back nine has been comfortable and you\u2019ve been able to sort of let it sink in. But to win by 15? It\u2019s remarkable.\u201d Woods looked short of health and/or fitness when missing the cut at last month\u2019s US PGA Championship. The specifics of the Masters champion\u2019s scenario, typically, were shrouded in mystery; Woods admitted to illness on the day before the tournament began, as it curtailed his practice. His mood and form were improved by early June\u2019s Memorial Tournament, where he finished tied ninth. The scale of the achievement within view for Brooks Koepka is illustrated by the fact that a US Open treble was last completed in 1905, when Scotsman Willie Anderson won a third in a row. Koepka\u2019s victory at that US PGA Championship, at Bethpage Black, extended his superb run to four major wins inside 23 months. \u201cThat name [Anderson] has come up a lot this year,\u201d he said. \u201cI know what I\u2019m chasing or trying to accomplish. It\u2019s just another tournament. You can put some outside pressure on. It\u2019s a major championship. I\u2019ll be up for it, I know that. I enjoy a tough test of golf and that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get at a US Open. You know that going in. It\u2019s fun to me to get on those big stages and try to win.\u201d Praise, hardly in short supply where Koepka is concerned, has been forthcoming from Woods. \u201cIt\u2019s about trying to peak at the right time,\u201d Woods said. \u201cThat\u2019s the trick and it\u2019s not easy to do. Brooks has done it better than anyone else over the last couple of years. \u201cHe knows what he needs to do and he seems to get his game, mind and body coming together for those big weeks. That\u2019s what we\u2019re all looking to have happen, but he\u2019s figured out what\u2019s best for him.\u201d Koepka\u2019s prediction of a stern challenge looks apt, with photography from recent days at Pebble Beach showing extremely dense rough. With that comes a premium on driving accuracy; as suits Koepka and McIlroy, if not, in theory, Woods. Nick Faldo branded the rough mega-thick with an added warning that this \u201cstifles the creativity\u201d of players. The USGA, beset by bad publicity in recent times in direct relation to the US Open, can barely afford another week of negativity. Pebble Beach was once Dustin Johnson territory. He won the AT&amp;T pro-am there in back-to-back years from 2010, long before he ended his major wait at the US Open of 2016. Not only has Johnson failed to kick on with \u2013 as was expected \u2013 further victories in the big four from there, he has recently redeveloped a tendency to claim defeat from the jaws of victory. In Johnson\u2019s defence, he at least provided a worthwhile Sunday challenge to Koepka at Bethpage as others waved white flags. \u201cThe fields are so deep nowadays that even with your really good golf, the game is very hard,\u201d said McIlroy. \u201cThat\u2019s why I was alluding to the fact that Tiger winning by 15, that might be something we only ever see once in our lifetime.\u201d Which means there is all the more reason to reflect upon it.",

They had suffered from depression for an average of 18 years and all had tried other treatments.

      "bodyText": "Lying on a bed in London\u2019s Hammersmith hospital ingesting capsules of psilocybin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, Michael had little idea what would happen next. The 56-year-old part-time website developer from County Durham in northern England had battled depression for 30 years and had tried talking therapies and many types of antidepressant with no success. His mother\u2019s death from cancer, followed by a friend\u2019s suicide, had left him at one of his lowest points yet. Searching online to see if mushrooms sprouting in his yard were the hallucinogenic variety, he had come across a pioneering medical trial at Imperial College London. Listening to music and surrounded by candles and flowers in the decorated clinical room, Michael anxiously waited for the drug to kick in. After 50 minutes, he saw bright lights leading into the distance and embarked on a five-hour journey into his own mind, where he would re-live a range of childhood memories and confront his grief. For the next three months, his depressive symptoms waned. He felt upbeat and accepting, enjoying pastimes he had come to feel apathetic about, such as walking through the Yorkshire countryside and taking photographs of nature. \u201cI became a different person,\u201d says Michael. \u201cI couldn\u2019t wait to get dressed, get into the outside world, see people. I was supremely confident \u2013 more like I was when I was younger, before the depression started and got to its worst.\u201d The trial, finished in 2016, was the first modern study to target treatment-resistant depression with psilocybin, a psychedelic drug naturally occurring in around 200 species of mushroom. To varying degrees, Michael and all 18 other participants saw their symptoms reduce a week after two treatments, including a high, 25mg dose. Five weeks later, nine out of 19 patients found that their depression was still significantly reduced (by 50% or more) \u2013 results that largely held steady for three months. They had suffered from depression for an average of 18 years and all had tried other treatments. In January this year, the trial launched its second stage: an ambitious effort to test psilocybin on a larger group and with more scientific rigour (including a control group, which Michael\u2019s study lacked), comparing the drug\u2019s performance with escitalopram, a common antidepressant. The team has now treated about a third of the 60 patients and say that early results are promising for psilocybin. Imperial\u2019s current work is among a string of new studies that a group of professors, campaigners and investors hope will lead to psilocybin\u2019s medical approval as a transformative treatment. Others soon to begin include an 80-person study run by Usona Institute, a Wisconsin-based medical non-profit, and a trial at King\u2019s College London, as well as a 216-person trial that is already under way around the US, Europe and Canada, managed by the London-based life sciences company Compass Pathways. Robin Carhart-Harris, head of Imperial\u2019s Centre for Psychedelic Research and a Compass scientific adviser, believes psilocybin could be a licensed medicine within five years, or potentially even sooner. \u201cBy about that point,\u201d he says, \u201cit would be like an irresistible force, and indefensible to ignore the weight of the evidence.\u201d Psilocybin mushrooms have been part of religious rituals for thousands of years.

A 2016 Johns Hopkins University study of 51 patients with life-threatening cancer showed high doses of psilocybin significantly reduced end-of-life depression and anxiety for six months in 80% of cases, and helped patients accept death; a New York University study that year showed similar results.

      "bodyText": "My children attend Kensington primary school in the inner northern suburb of Melbourne. It has several chickens, a fabulous cooking-gardening program and dedicated teachers who provide interesting and varied educational opportunities. It also has five large steps up into the charming heritage-listed building. A tall chain-link fence rims the playground, and between the hours of 7am and 6pm the school gates are locked with a padlock. Granted, this is for child safety \u2013 locking them in and any bad people out. However, my husband is also locked out because the gates provide the only disabled access to the school and he uses a wheelchair. There is nothing new about inaccessibility. The other day I saw a car parked across the base of a wheelchair ramp, an ATM bolted in front of disabled toilets preventing the doors from opening properly, and in the west we still have old-school, wheelchair-hostile, Z-class trams clattering through our streets. Jamming onto the train during peak hour \u2013 a challenge for the slimmest among us \u2013 is next to impossible for a wheelchair user. Rather than serving trendy and unpronounceable food on high garage-style stools, our favourite eateries have low tables and lack stairs. Aisles and footpaths are often too narrow for wheelchairs and all the good stuff is always kept on high shelves. Even homes considerably more Kondo\u2019d than ours are rarely easy. My husband has crafted \u201cshort stick with hook\u201d and \u201clong stick with hook\u201d and transformed our garage into a complex ropes course that allows him access to things up high. I lose count of the times each day I think \u201cthat would be hard for him\u201d. But unlike me, my children grew up with a disabled parent and they question why places are not accessible in the same tone they use to wonder where wind comes from, or why fire is hot. Teachers at KPS often speak of inclusion and diversity. My daughter\u2019s class watched a documentary about the Paralympian Kurt Fearnley crawling the Kokoda trail to initiate a discussion about resilience and overcoming challenges. \u201cWhen I told my class you were in a wheelchair, everyone was so excited to hear about you,\u201d my daughter happily told her dad as she sat on his lap that night. Children love hearing about experiences outside of their own sphere of understanding, and learning about disabilities and accessibility is important. As my son eloquently said during his first year at KPS: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that you can\u2019t get in.\u201d Those words pretty much sum up the disability access to building standards (2010) developed under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (DDA). The standards strive to \u201censure that dignified, equitable, cost-effective and reasonably achievable access to buildings, and facilities and services within buildings, is provided for people with a disability\u201d. The Department of Education and Training requires schools to comply with DDA and disability standards.

      "body": "<p>What do we talk about when we talk about domestic violence? We talk about the scary, rageaholic man and his hapless female partner. We talk about the sudden boiling over. We talk about, as the American journalist and author <a href=\"https://www.globalgrit.com/\" title=\"\">Rachel Louise Snyder</a> puts it, \u201cthe unfortunate fate of the unlucky few\u201d. We talk about the woman\u2019s (they are mostly women, 50 a month gunned down in the US) tragic pattern of filing charges and dropping them, making complaints and frequently recanting, greeting him with hugs and kisses and a hot dinner the day he gets out of jail.</p> <p>What is also talked about are the more recent remedies (for most of history, assault of a wife by a husband was not any kind of crime) of restraining orders and the need for the safe haven of shelters for abused women and their children.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is a river of shame and grief in this book, and even the most well meaning wade in it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Snyder is here to tell us, in her clear, smooth and accessible style (never folksy but never academic, and so matter-of-fact you can feel the writer holding herself in check so as not to overwhelm us with painful details), that we have misunderstood. The most dangerous place for an American woman to be \u2013 the most dangerous place on Earth \u2013 is in her own home. Snyder uses the case of a Montana family, Michelle and Rocky Mosure and their children, to create a strong narrative spine that runs through the book (which has been much praised in the US, described as a book that will \u201csave lives\u201d by the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/how-to-protect-women-from-domestic-violence--before-its-too-late/2019/05/17/b36dcf22-6b73-11e9-8f44-e8d8bb1df986_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.8a39df7d3a88\" title=\"\"><em>Washington Post</em></a>). She interviews everyone who can be heard from: family, attorneys, police officers.</p> <p>There is a river of shame and grief in this book, and even the most well meaning wade in it. Even those who seem to refuse responsibility (\u201cThe criminal justice system isn\u2019t set up for uncooperative witnesses,\u201d says a former district attorney) do also seem to know better and to regret, genuinely, all the things that went wrong and led to a young woman and her children being murdered by a man who was known to the police and to the courts for having beaten and terrorised them all repeatedly.</p> <p>In one of the most powerful passages, Snyder describes the home movies of the Mosure family; how Rocky keeps turning the camera on Michelle in her underwear. She asks him to stop, she asks him to stop again. Then she gives up asking and ignores him. It\u2019s just a home movie. He\u2019s just kidding around. And Snyder writes: why is that not OK? Why does her skin crawl, while watching? \u201cBecause she asked him to stop. And he didn\u2019t. And eventually she gave up asking. This is loss of power at its most elemental.\u201d</p> <p> This is the problem with power: most men who abuse are not consumed with constant rage, they are consumed with the need to be treated the way they believe (and they way they have been taught) men should be treated.

      "bodyText": "What do we talk about when we talk about domestic violence? We talk about the scary, rageaholic man and his hapless female partner. We talk about the sudden boiling over. We talk about, as the American journalist and author Rachel Louise Snyder puts it, \u201cthe unfortunate fate of the unlucky few\u201d. We talk about the woman\u2019s (they are mostly women, 50 a month gunned down in the US) tragic pattern of filing charges and dropping them, making complaints and frequently recanting, greeting him with hugs and kisses and a hot dinner the day he gets out of jail. What is also talked about are the more recent remedies (for most of history, assault of a wife by a husband was not any kind of crime) of restraining orders and the need for the safe haven of shelters for abused women and their children. Snyder is here to tell us, in her clear, smooth and accessible style (never folksy but never academic, and so matter-of-fact you can feel the writer holding herself in check so as not to overwhelm us with painful details), that we have misunderstood. The most dangerous place for an American woman to be \u2013 the most dangerous place on Earth \u2013 is in her own home. Snyder uses the case of a Montana family, Michelle and Rocky Mosure and their children, to create a strong narrative spine that runs through the book (which has been much praised in the US, described as a book that will \u201csave lives\u201d by the Washington Post). She interviews everyone who can be heard from: family, attorneys, police officers. There is a river of shame and grief in this book, and even the most well meaning wade in it. Even those who seem to refuse responsibility (\u201cThe criminal justice system isn\u2019t set up for uncooperative witnesses,\u201d says a former district attorney) do also seem to know better and to regret, genuinely, all the things that went wrong and led to a young woman and her children being murdered by a man who was known to the police and to the courts for having beaten and terrorised them all repeatedly. In one of the most powerful passages, Snyder describes the home movies of the Mosure family; how Rocky keeps turning the camera on Michelle in her underwear. She asks him to stop, she asks him to stop again. Then she gives up asking and ignores him. It\u2019s just a home movie. He\u2019s just kidding around. And Snyder writes: why is that not OK? Why does her skin crawl, while watching? \u201cBecause she asked him to stop. And he didn\u2019t. And eventually she gave up asking. This is loss of power at its most elemental.\u201d This is the problem with power: most men who abuse are not consumed with constant rage, they are consumed with the need to be treated the way they believe (and they way they have been taught) men should be treated. They should be served. They should be at the head of the table. They should be respected, above all, in their own homes. (And by respected, they mean obeyed.) It doesn\u2019t come up much, in discourse about domestic violence in the US; this bright red thread of everyday expectations for female behaviour in intimate settings with their partners. But once you read Snyder\u2019s book it is impossible not to see a whole culture (at its most normal \u2013 I am including lots of fond dads and grandpas, not Trump and his henchmen) of women fetching and soothing and placating. There was a charming episode on black-ish, the US sitcom, about making your man a plate of food. I loved it and I cringed. I don\u2019t think that making your man a plate of food is the linchpin of domestic violence. I do think that the casual outstretched hand, eyes on the TV, expecting and receiving service as part of being a man, is not unconnected to the much darker manifestations of furious control and demands of abusive men. And it\u2019s certainly understandable that most people don\u2019t wish to see those threads as connecting, although abusers in programmes such as RSVP and Emerge in the US often do come to see that they are coercive and manipulative in their relationships with women and that since childhood they have been fed a line of what it is to be a man, which includes a lot of blame, combat, denial of responsibility and resentment.

His confirmation \u2013 despite Anita Hill\u2019s credible testimony about sexual harassment \u2013 tipped the bench to the conservatives. Roe looked doomed. But in a <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744\">June 1</a><em><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744\">992</a></em><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1991/91-744\"> ruling</a><em>,</em> three Republican appointees joined the court\u2019s liberals to reaffirm women\u2019s constitutional right to legal abortion<em>.</em></p> <p>Seven weeks later, an unpopular president, George HW Bush, surrendered the Republican convention to the only people he thought could keep him in power \u2013 the anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, radical religious right. The platform, over Bush\u2019s personal objection, called for banning abortion from the moment of conception. From the stage, rightwing leaders denounced \u201cabortion on demand\u201d, \u201chomosexual rights\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/patrickbuchanan1992rnc.htm\">radical feminism</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Bush\u2019s gambit with the religious right backfired. Bush was crushed by a counterforce galvanized by Republican attacks on reproductive freedom and women\u2019s rights. In the spring, upwards of 1 million people marched in Washington in the nation\u2019s largest ever demonstration for reproductive freedom. In November, a record number of women were elected to Congress \u2013 most of them backed by the pro-choice group Emily\u2019s List. Bush received only 37.5% of the popular vote. 1992 went down in history as the (first) year of the woman.</p> <p>To be sure, 1992 deserved its Clintonworld moniker: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d The poor economy was the <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2111651?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">No 1 issue</a> for the majority of voters.</p> <p>Yet Bill Clinton had also campaigned as a champion of reproductive rights, and that paid off. Post-election analyses showed that support for legal abortion had the second strongest effect of any issue on vote choice. In addition, for a quarter of all voters, abortion \u2013 not the economy \u2013 was the No 1 issue. </p> <p>Republicans were on the wrong side of public opinion on abortion, and that proved enormously costly for Bush. Support for legal abortion in all circumstances reached a then record high of 61%, with two-thirds of Democrats and independents \u2013 and even a majority of Republicans \u2013 holding pro-choice views. Altogether, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2960276?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents\">according to a study</a> by the political scientist Alan Abramowitz, Bush lost one out of six Republicans over the GOP\u2019s opposition to abortion, as pro-choice Republicans defected to Clinton or Ross Perot.</p> <p>2012 featured a similar \u2013 if more surprising \u2013 showdown over women\u2019s reproductive rights. As Republicans began casting their primary votes, the GOP House convened all-male hearings to denounce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that health insurance cover birth control. Over the course of the campaign, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, called Roe v Wade \u201cone of the darkest moments in supreme court history\u201d, published an op-ed against the birth control mandate and pledged to \u201cget rid of\u201d Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, Republican-controlled states were passing a wave of invasive and unnecessary restrictions on abortion care. For good measure, Republican Senate candidates floated outrageous <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2012/10/mourdock-rape-pregnancy-and-gods-plan-082795\">theories</a> about rape and pregnancy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In 2012, as in 1992, vocal support for reproductive freedom helped elect a Democratic president and Senate</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2012, as in 1992, vocal support for reproductive freedom helped elect a Democratic president and <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/senate-results-2012_n_2039118\">Senate</a>. Barack Obama, like Clinton before, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvpE-yEyvKI\">leaned into</a> the fight.

      "bodyText": "Late Thursday night, Joe Biden reversed his position on the Hyde amendment, which bans federal funding for abortion. The former vice-president\u2019s abrupt announcement that he now opposes the Hyde amendment, just days after his campaign had announced his support for it, confirms \u2013 if anyone doubted it \u2013 that abortion is on the ballot in 2020. Despite the conventional wisdom, which holds that abortion only motivates voters on the right, history suggests otherwise: boldly supporting a woman\u2019s right to legal abortion is a winning strategy for Democrats on the road to the White House. When the issue of abortion is activated during a presidential campaign \u2013 like it was in 1992 and 2012 \u2013 it results in big wins for Democrats. Just as the 1992 presidential campaign was heating up, the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the supreme court sparked national debate about abortion. His confirmation \u2013 despite Anita Hill\u2019s credible testimony about sexual harassment \u2013 tipped the bench to the conservatives. Roe looked doomed. But in a June 1992 ruling, three Republican appointees joined the court\u2019s liberals to reaffirm women\u2019s constitutional right to legal abortion. Seven weeks later, an unpopular president, George HW Bush, surrendered the Republican convention to the only people he thought could keep him in power \u2013 the anti-abortion, anti-LGBTQ, radical religious right. The platform, over Bush\u2019s personal objection, called for banning abortion from the moment of conception. From the stage, rightwing leaders denounced \u201cabortion on demand\u201d, \u201chomosexual rights\u201d and \u201cradical feminism\u201d. Bush\u2019s gambit with the religious right backfired. Bush was crushed by a counterforce galvanized by Republican attacks on reproductive freedom and women\u2019s rights. In the spring, upwards of 1 million people marched in Washington in the nation\u2019s largest ever demonstration for reproductive freedom. In November, a record number of women were elected to Congress \u2013 most of them backed by the pro-choice group Emily\u2019s List. Bush received only 37.5% of the popular vote. 1992 went down in history as the (first) year of the woman. To be sure, 1992 deserved its Clintonworld moniker: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d The poor economy was the No 1 issue for the majority of voters. Yet Bill Clinton had also campaigned as a champion of reproductive rights, and that paid off. Post-election analyses showed that support for legal abortion had the second strongest effect of any issue on vote choice. In addition, for a quarter of all voters, abortion \u2013 not the economy \u2013 was the No 1 issue. Republicans were on the wrong side of public opinion on abortion, and that proved enormously costly for Bush. Support for legal abortion in all circumstances reached a then record high of 61%, with two-thirds of Democrats and independents \u2013 and even a majority of Republicans \u2013 holding pro-choice views. Altogether, according to a study by the political scientist Alan Abramowitz, Bush lost one out of six Republicans over the GOP\u2019s opposition to abortion, as pro-choice Republicans defected to Clinton or Ross Perot. 2012 featured a similar \u2013 if more surprising \u2013 showdown over women\u2019s reproductive rights. As Republicans began casting their primary votes, the GOP House convened all-male hearings to denounce the Affordable Care Act\u2019s requirement that health insurance cover birth control. Over the course of the campaign, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, called Roe v Wade \u201cone of the darkest moments in supreme court history\u201d, published an op-ed against the birth control mandate and pledged to \u201cget rid of\u201d Planned Parenthood. Meanwhile, Republican-controlled states were passing a wave of invasive and unnecessary restrictions on abortion care. For good measure, Republican Senate candidates floated outrageous theories about rape and pregnancy. In 2012, as in 1992, vocal support for reproductive freedom helped elect a Democratic president and Senate. Barack Obama, like Clinton before, leaned into the fight. A post-election study by scholars Melissa Deckman and John McTague found that the birth control mandate was overwhelmingly popular. They concluded it \u201cwas a winning issue for the Democratic party\u201d and particularly decisive in Obama\u2019s whopping 7.5m vote margin with women. In short, in two of the most consequential elections of recent years, Republicans\u2019 anti-abortion extremism galvanized a pro-choice majority to give Democrats control of the White House and Senate. 2020 looks to repeat that history \u2013 unless Democrats nominate someone out of step with their voters\u2019 views. Someone who, say, supports the Hyde amendment. Support for access to legal abortion remains strong and stable nationwide, with two-thirds of Americans opposed to overturning Roe v Wade. Even in Georgia, where one of the most restrictive bans was enacted, 70% are opposed to overturning Roe. Likewise, recent elections provide compelling evidence that defending legal abortion is still a winner. In 2018, following the Kavanaugh hearings, which injected the fate of Roe and the issue of sexual assault into the campaign, exit polls showed 66% of voters favored keeping Roe as is. Democrats won seven in 10 of those pro-Roe voters. Democrats flipped two Senate seats, four governorships and 23 House seats with proudly pro-choice female candidates. (And that\u2019s not even counting the many pro-choice men who also won.) Looking ahead to 2020 and the key pickup states, the advantage lies with those who support legal abortion. In the \u201cblue wall\u201d states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota, more than 54% think abortion should be legal in all or most cases \u2013 by a 12- to 18-point margin over those who think it should be illegal in all or most cases. It would be a mistake for Democrats to stay quiet or support middling positions on abortion. To their credit, most of the Democratic presidential candidates have condemned the recent abortion bans, called for the repeal of the Hyde amendment, and proposed protections for women\u2019s reproductive health access. And the female candidates have plans. The takeaway is clear: recent history tells us that when access to legal abortion is openly threatened by politicians beholden to the right, outspoken pro-choice Democratic candidates have the advantage.

While the number of rapes reported to the police nearly tripled between 2014 and 2018, EVAW points out that the number of cases charged and sent to court fell by 44%. It says fewer than 4% of women who report attacks can now expect their complaint to reach trial.

      "bodyText": "Top story: \u2018There are clearly still concerns\u2019 Hello, Warren Murray here with the news you need this Monday morning. The leader of Hong Kong\u2019s government says she remains determined to pass a controversial extradition bill, despite up to a million people marching against the legislation. Largely peaceful scenes outside parliament and government headquarters changed dramatically on Monday morning as riot police moved in, using batons and pepper spray on protesters who hurled bottles and metal barricades. Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, a key target of the rally, said this morning that the size of the rally showed there were \u201cclearly still concerns\u201d but refused to withdraw the bill, saying: \u201cHong Kong has to move on, nobody wants Hong Kong to be a fugitive offenders haven. We are doing it.\u201d Critics say the proposed extradition law will allow Beijing authorities to spirit away political opponents from Hong Kong and put them on trial in mainland China where the Communist party controls the judicial system. * * * Gove\u2019s hopes gone up in coke? \u2013 The prospect of the UK having a prime minister who is unable to travel to the United States is being raised after Michael Gove, one of the contenders to replace Theresa May, admitted having used cocaine about 20 years ago. Gove insists he has never misled authorities about it and dismissed as \u201cfoolish\u201d the idea of being barred from the US. Rival campaigns pounced \u2013 Sajid Javid, the home secretary, hit out at middle-class users of class A drugs who failed to think of the \u201ccountless lives destroyed\u201d by the trade. Other leadership contenders have at various times admitted their dabbling with a joint, cannabis lassi or opium pipe but largely denied using class A drugs, apart from Boris Johnson who reckoned he might have been given cocaine once. In the leadership race, Johnson has become the latest candidate to promise tax cuts for the better off; while Sam Gyimah is arguing that more and more Tory MPs are recognising that a second referendum is the only way out of the Brexit mess. * * * Challenge over rape charge decline \u2013 The Crown Prosecution Service is accused of making covert policy changes that are blamed for a collapse in the number of rape cases going to court. A judicial review is being sought by the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) which has sent the CPS a dossier of 21 cases where decisions have been made not to charge, despite allegedly compelling evidence. While the number of rapes reported to the police nearly tripled between 2014 and 2018, EVAW points out that the number of cases charged and sent to court fell by 44%. It says fewer than 4% of women who report attacks can now expect their complaint to reach trial. A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cDecisions to prosecute are based on whether our legal tests are met \u2013 no other reason \u2013 and we always seek to prosecute where there is sufficient evidence to do so.\u201d * * * \u2018Fell straight through the building\u2019 \u2013 A woman has died and at least six people were injured when a crane collapsed on to an apartment building in Dallas amid severe thunderstorms. The crane fell on the Elan City Lights building. Witness Isaiah Allen told the Dallas Morning News he was in his apartment when he heard what sounded like a clap of thunder. \u201cI saw that the crane had actually fell straight through the building and had destroyed a good eight to 10 apartments.\u201d Two people were taken to hospital in critical condition and three in non-critical but serious condition, said authorities. * * * Next payday after PPI \u2013 Payday lenders have complained they are being bombarbed by dodgy complaints from claims management firms (CMCs). The window for payouts stemming from the payment protection insurance scandal (PPI) closes in August, and the lenders claim CMCs are now looking for their next big earner. Payday lenders have come under heavy fire from politicians, debt campaigners and regulators for high interest on short-term loans. CMCs portray themselves as consumer champions but many also charge high fees and have questionable business practices. The lenders\u2019 body, the Consumer Finance Association, says\u201cworrying tactics\u201d are being used by the claims industry including poor quality complaints, data protection breaches and complaints made without the borrower\u2019s permission. * * * Shout for help \u2013 On the digital frontline against youth suicide, Shout is making inroads by using text messages to offer troubled young people help and reassurance. Since it was launched last month, Shout\u2019s operators have been handling 500 conversations a day, 70% from women and girls, sometimes from classrooms and playgrounds. The service caters to younger people who might not pick up the phone or talk to friends or family, but are comfortable texting their problems to a stranger who will try to guide them to professional help. Angus Fowler, one of its volunteers, says being on the system was like seeing \u201ca tidal wave of mental health problems coming at us\u201d. Dr Fiona Pienaar, the chief clinical officer at Mental Health Innovations, the charity that runs Shout, says: \u201cWe hear from hundreds of people across the UK each day who are vulnerable and isolated and don\u2019t feel they have anyone they can reach out to. The anonymity of texting means that often they are telling us something they haven\u2019t told anyone else.\u201d The service can be reached by texting SHOUT to 85258. Today in Focus podcast: Are peers asleep on the job? Investigative journalist David Pegg and data journalist Pamela Duncan have spent the last four months examining the House of Lords. They discuss why the upper house is under such pressure to reform. Plus: Iman Amrani on her modern masculinity series. Lunchtime read: Cable leaves a rejuvenated Lib Dem party \u201cBollocks\u201d is toned down to \u201cHorlicks\u201d as Jonathan Freedland interviews Vince Cable, the soon-to-be Lib Dem leader emeritus. Cable will step down this summer, and what a way for him to go out. A few months ago the party was down to 11 MPs, its brand still tarnished by five years in coalition with David Cameron\u2019s Tories. That changed last month with the Lib Dems making big gains in the local elections, then beating Labour into third place in the European elections. Now the talk is of the Lib Dems as the obvious repository of the remain vote, the potential home for millions of one-time disaffected Tory and Labour supporters. So what about a remain electoral alliance between the Greens, Lib Dems and the nascent Change UK? \u201cYes, if [Brexit] is the dominant issue of the day, it would be absolutely sensible to do it. And I would hope that we would have quite a lot of Labour and Tory [MPs] who would, at an individual level, go along with this as well.\u201d Sport Lyon fans will have something to look forward to next season as Lucy Bronze and Nikita Parris gave a stunning preview of their connection in England\u2019s win over Scotland at the Women\u2019s World Cup. \u201cWe have a connection that I haven\u2019t had with any other full-back. She made my time at Manchester City special and hopefully will make my time at Lyon special. She\u2019s a great player, even more so for England. We have a great relationship,\u201d said Parris of her teammate. Optimistic that finally he might claim Ferrari\u2019s first victory this season, Sebastian Vettel\u2019s hopes turned to bitter ashes as he was denied by a controversial penalty at the Canadian Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton took the win for Mercedes but only after an incident that left Vettel fuming, disappointed and confused as to how the decision against him was made. Business Asian financial markets have advanced after China released better-than-expected trade data for May. The Hang Seng picked up 2.2% and Shanghai was 1% higher. The Nikkei 225 advanced 1.1% while the Kospi in South Korea rose 0.9%. Shares rose in Taiwan and throughout south-east Asia, while Australian markets were closed. The pound is worth $1.271 and \u20ac1.123 while the FTSE is tracking to open higher by half a per cent or so. The papers Michael Gove\u2019s cocaine past leads many of the front pages.

Our one night there was a Willy Wonka-esque dream come true for hungry cyclists. We were guests of Luca, a keen cyclist and sculptor who owns the gelateria in the centre of town, and Andrea, a dancer. They were two of many people we met through <a href=\"https://www.warmshowers.org/\" title=\"\">Warmshowers</a>, a hosting app that\u2019s like <a href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.com/\" title=\"\">Couch</a><a href=\"http://www.couchsurfing.com/\" title=\"\">surfing</a> for cyclists (see below).</p> <p>We were shown straight to the table, already laid with a basket of fresh bread.

He presented plate after plate of homemade pumpkin ravioli with a knowing smile. We didn\u2019t finish eating until close to midnight. And then, after a <em>digestivo</em> of limoncello, Andrea asked: \u201cDo you want to see the ice-cream?\u201d</p> <p>The streets were empty, lit by sodium-orange street lamps.

We were kids breaking into a sweetshop for a midnight feast with our new friends. Our working lives back in London couldn\u2019t have felt further away.</p> <p>Italy in spring turned out to be a perfect match for us. After battling snowstorms in Germany and climbing the Swiss Alps, the flat lands lining the River Po were a welcome break \u2013 a fortnight of fair- weather cycling to reward us for a month of drama. The river snaked east, twisting and widening gradually alongside us. For the first time since leaving the UK, we could cover more than 100km a day and still have enough energy to go exploring in the evenings.</p> <p>And while the lack of gradients could get monotonous, the accompanying wildlife more than made up for it. Flamingos made stick-figure silhouettes above the silver waters of the Venice lagoon, and families of curious beaver-ish animals grazed the banks. We later learnt that these furry bystanders are called <em>nutria</em> (coypu in English) and considered a huge pest in Italy, but for us they\u2019ll always be the \u201cbeaver-rats\u201d, unofficial mascots cheering us on as we rolled past.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0c15201ec9b5e191b5ca439c7fce85ee7c1369ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c15201ec9b5e191b5ca439c7fce85ee7c1369ef/0_0_3728_2236/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ruth on a track in the Po valley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Road less travelled \u2026 the Po valley made for great spring cycling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Townsend</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We were also fuelled by pizza, espressos and the kindness of locals.

We arrived at Easter and were invited to join their family for the Sunday feast.</p> <p>We felt distinctly British as 17 family members from three generations piled around the dinner table, talking loudly over each other with exaggerated hand gestures and huge amounts of love. We devoured plates of homemade lasagne, black rice salad, bread and olives, more pasta and, last but not least, Nonna Maria\u2019s delicious almond cake. The mothers and grandmothers kept entreating us to \u201cmangia, mangia!\u201d, while the grandfathers continued topping up our glasses with grappa. By the end of it, we were well and truly part of the family and completely stuffed. At least half of the party fell asleep in the sun after dinner, only to be roused by the smell of yet another espresso.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26097ef21c9bb03b18d8104fba9c3870052f32ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26097ef21c9bb03b18d8104fba9c3870052f32ef/0_522_7797_4679/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nonna Maria sitting at a table\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nonna Maria, maker of delicious almond cake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ruth Newton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We moved more slowly as we headed off north, heavier from the feast and a weekend off our bikes. As with many families we met along the way, Alberto and Sabrina had urged us to stay longer than planned, and it was hard to get moving again. We could have happily remained with them for a week, playing volleyball with their eight-year-old daughter and planting seeds in their huge greenhouse.</p> <p>But we knew we had to pedal on. We wanted to reach Turkey during Ramadan, and the Pamir Highway in central Asia by mid to late summer, when the weather would be temperate. We reminded ourselves of that as we packed and repacked our panniers and trundled into the early morning light.</p> <p>As happened with most of the 22 countries we cycled across, the main thing we remember about Italy is the people. The Italian tendency towards openness and unquestioning hospitality seems to be in their bones and, hopefully, we\u2019ve picked up a pinch of this on our travels. Now that we are back in the UK, we\u2019re looking forward to hosting people ourselves. We can\u2019t offer midnight tours of ice-cream parlours, but we can lay on a feast and share stories well into the night.

      "body": "<p>Vince Cable, the other party leader stepping down this summer, looks like a man ready to hand over. In the Twickenham home he has lived in for 45 years, a table is covered with piles of notes and clippings from the Financial Times \u2013 \u201chorizontal filing,\u201d he calls it \u2013 research for a new book he is working on. It is a study of how major politicians \u201chave changed the way we do economics\u201d, from Alexander Hamilton to Margaret Thatcher and, although he has not made a final decision on this \u2013 because who knows how the story will end? \u2013 Donald Trump. He will soon have more time for that project. Unlike Theresa May, the 76-year-old leader of the Liberal Democrats did not have to be dragged from politics\u2019 front line. It was his decision.</p> <p>But what a way to go. A few months ago, the Lib Dems were down to just 11 MPs. It seemed that theirs was a permanently ruined brand, rendered toxic by five years in coalition with David Cameron\u2019s Tories. The decline was painfully obvious every Wednesday lunchtime, when Cable would have to wait the best part of 45 minutes to be called at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, long after the leaders of Labour and the Scottish National Party and a string of backbenchers. He and his party were a political afterthought.Any centrist energy was focused on the Independent Group, the breakaway of Labour and Conservative MPs who looked set to gobble up the Lib Dem vote and perhaps the party itself.</p> <p>That changed last month, which began with the Lib Dems making big gains in the local elections in England and ended more spectacularly still, as the party beat Labour into third place in the European elections, grabbing 20.3% of the vote. Now the talk is of the Lib Dems as the obvious repository of the remain vote, the potential home for millions of one-time Tory and Labour supporters disaffected with their parties\u2019 stances on Brexit. Several analysts, including <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robfordmancs/status/1135146694121840641\" title=\"\">some not given to hyperbole</a>, are musing about a realignment, with the Lib Dems potentially replacing Labour as the lead opponents of Brexit and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party.</p> <p>Does that mean Cable, handing over just as things are looking up, has had second thoughts? \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a commitment to the party, to my wife and to myself that I would move on.\u201d He admits that leadership takes its toll: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical wear and tear \u2013 dashing around \u2013 it\u2019s the mental pressure. Every time you get a bad opinion poll, it\u2019s quite stressful.\u201d He also means it when he says that he wants to spend more time with his family. \u201cI\u2019m one of those fortunate people who\u2019s been happily married twice,\u201d he says. His first wife, Olympia, died of breast cancer in 2001, and he married Rachel Wenban Smith in 2004. He speaks easily and directly about his love for both women. On the walls there are photos of both wedding days; on his finger there are two wedding rings. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy doing things together,\u201d he says of Rachel. \u201cI want to enjoy that life rather than spend all my remaining days slogging round the political circuit.\u201d Besides, he says, he always saw himself as \u201csomething of a stopgap\u201d leader, right from when he took over in 2017, waiting until the next generation were ready.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"87337a633e01a1112f392d352f85a57ec4e46c29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87337a633e01a1112f392d352f85a57ec4e46c29/0_686_6114_3670/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vince Cable and his wife Rachel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re very happy doing things together\u2019: Cable and his wife Rachel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He does not claim too much personal credit for the Lib Dem renaissance. The local advances, he says, were the fruit of old-fashioned Lib Dem graft: activists plugging away, on the ground, for years. And, undeniably, he adds, the party has benefited from the failings of the big two. The Tories have made \u201cthe most appalling Horlicks\u201d of Brexit, while most Labour MPs privately concede, he says, that their party\u2019s position is \u201chopeless as well as unpleasant\u201d.</p> <p>Will his parting shot to the Lib Dem faithful be a channelling of David Steel, urging them to \u201cgo back to your constituencies and prepare for government\u201d? It won\u2019t, but realignment is, Cable says, \u201cbecoming more than a possibility. Not least because the Tories and the Labour party appear to be doubling down on their existing strategy, which is suicidal in both cases.\u201d</p> <p>It is a big claim, but he sticks with it. Corbynism is not a sustainable strategy for a party of the left in the UK, he says, chiefly for economic reasons. Voters will always demand that Labour\u2019s sums add up. \u201c\u2018Two plus two equals five\u2019 isn\u2019t an election-winning formula, and I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s where they are. Old fashioned state socialism just isn\u2019t remotely where the country is or what it needs.\u201d He still believes in the same vision of a mixed economy he advocated back when he was in the Labour party \u2013 he was one of those who broke off to form the Social Democratic party (SDP) \u2013 describing himself even now as an \u201cold-fashioned social democrat who used to work for John Smith. I probably haven\u2019t moved on in some ways.\u201d As for the Tories, they \u201cseem determined just to dig in behind this kind of English nationalism. Brexit is a proxy for something bigger and deeper.\u201d<strong> </strong>He fears Conservatives have \u201cchosen to identify themselves with what Isaiah Berlin once called the \u2018politics of the soil\u2019\u201d.<strong> </strong>It\u2019s a trend that, for Cable, is not just \u201cnasty, but dangerous\u201d.</p> <p>But the two main parties repelling millions of voters was never going to be enough, on its own, to ensure a Lib Dem surge. It helped that the party had a catchy slogan. \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d was not Cable\u2019s own coinage: a Lib Dem staffer suggested it, he says, having seen it on a <a href=\"https://www.pimlicoplumbers.com/blog/bollocks-to-brexit-the-sign-ain-t-coming-down-until-brexit-is-defeated\" title=\"\">sign</a> attached to Pimlico Plumbers near Waterloo station in south London. Cable was not sure about it at first, but he overcame his hesitation. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be clear than it is to be polite or whatever,\u201d he says</p> <p>Still, another condition had to pertain for the Lib Dems to make the European breakthrough: the party had to have the centre ground all to itself. Happily for the Lib Dems, Change UK (as the Independent Group had renamed themselves) obliged. So what does Cable think went wrong for that new grouping, which last week split in two?</p> <p>\u201cFirst of all, they went too soon.\u201d A second problem, recalls this veteran of the SDP\u2019s founding in 1981, is \u201cif you contrast the leadership today of Change UK with the SDP leadership 30 years ago, we\u2019re talking different league altogether. [Roy] Jenkins, [David] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/mar/21/david-owen-desperation-heresa-may-independent-group-labour-brexit\" title=\"\">Owen</a>, all the rest of them. And also [the SDP] was incredibly well planned. I mean, they had planned it for two years, and it was done in association with David Steel. It was a really serious attempt to break the mould. This [Change UK] just sort of happened at a fairly low level.\u201cThey rushed into an election without realising that you need an infrastructure to fight an election, and then made elementary mistakes. I mean, it\u2019s sad in a way, because I like the people. We agree with them on almost everything.\u201d (Which is slightly odd, because a moment earlier he had diagnosed Change UK\u2019s greatest problem as \u201cthe fact that they were trying to launch a new organisation which didn\u2019t have any intellectual or political coherence at the heart of it\u201d.)</p> <p>But there was another mistake, says Cable. \u201cI did urge that we work together, but they decided to compete. Anyway, they\u2019ve had, I think, a chastening experience, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"97d07bb26c587bb5635de983100a60a287fa8678\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97d07bb26c587bb5635de983100a60a287fa8678/0_4_2999_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vince Cable as business secretary in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cable visits the National Renewable Energy Centre, at Blyth, Northumberland, as business secretary in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Pinder/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Surely the next step is obvious, and not just between the Lib Dems and Change UK. Isn\u2019t now the moment for an alliance of the key, non-nationalist parties fully committed to remaining in the EU? Given the Westminster electoral system, isn\u2019t that the only way to prevail?</p> <p>If I was expecting equivocation or I\u2019ll-leave-that-to-my-successor boilerplate, Cable doesn\u2019t supply it. Instead, he recalls how his party and the Greens have had an electoral pact for Twickenham council contests that has worked out for both of them. \u201cSo I would be in favour, in principle, of extending that kind of arrangement\u201d nationwide, he says. He knows there will be Lib Dem resistance, and \u201cthere will be Greens who will be going on about the coalition, but \u2026 I personally think that would be a sensible way to conduct an election.\u201d So an alliance of Greens, Lib Dems and, in a handful of seats, Change UK? \u201cYes, if [Brexit] is the dominant issue of the day, it would be absolutely sensible to do it. And I would hope that we would have quite a lot of Labour and Tory [MPs] who would, at an individual level, go along with this as well.\u201d</p> <p>When I use the word merger, he initially resists. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not talking about merging, we\u2019re just talking about cooperation.\u201d I\u2019m about to rephrase, when he says, \u201cBut one thing leads to another, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d So perhaps a merger of Lib Dems and Greens, until Westminster elections are run under a PR system? \u201cIt could be, yeah.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s say a remain alliance got its way, and Brexit was averted. Does he not worry that will leave behind a furious, pro-Brexit constituency who will feel bitterly, even dangerously, betrayed? He agrees that there will be an angry, \u201ctruculent\u201d minority, but says it\u2019s \u201cfeeble\u201d to suggest remainers should hold their nose and get on with leaving the EU just to pacify that group. \u201cIf anybody\u2019s got any grievance about the democratic system, it\u2019s probably my party, or the Green party, or Ukip for that matter. We\u2019re horribly underrepresented, but we\u2019ve got on with it and done the best we can.\u201d Besides, remainers would have to win a second referendum before they could cancel Brexit and he reckons leavers \u201cwould be substantially mollified if we went through that process\u201d.</p> <p>Still, the European election might have been a one-off, a protest vote: for any kind of alliance to succeed at Westminster, surely the Lib Dems would have to do deeper penance for their complicity in austerity. Cable does not agree. If by austerity you mean the macro-economic policy of reducing the deficit, Cable will defend that with vigour. He believes the coalition was right about that and that a Labour government would have had to do the same.

But \u201cwe hadn\u2019t got the numbers\u201d.) Put to him the anti-austerity counter arguments, and the trained economist will come right back at you: \u201cThe Keynesian multipliers just didn\u2019t apply in an economy where the banking system didn\u2019t function.\u201d</p> <p>But if by austerity you mean the deep spending cuts that have left Britain\u2019s public services reeling, the argument is more nuanced. He says the really damaging cuts came after 2015, once the Lib Dems were ejected from power. But he agrees that the coalition should have cut spending less and raised taxes more. He doesn\u2019t blame the Tories for all of that: \u201cWe [the Lib Dems] had committed ourselves to raising income tax thresholds, so we had already boxed ourselves in to some extent to a tax-cutting, as opposed to a tax-raising, agenda.\u201d But he says he very nearly got a mansion tax through: George Osborne agreed, Cameron said no. Still, he concedes: \u201cThere were particular things that were done \u2013 the bedroom tax is an obvious one \u2013 which were just awful, and we should never have signed up to.\u201d</p> <p>He laments how the government he belonged to \u201cslashed local government spending\u201d by front-loading cuts rather than phasing them in, but he blames that on the Tories in charge of that ministry. \u201cWe were outnumbered five to one in the government, and people forget that.\u201d Shouldn\u2019t they have done the DUP trick, propping up Cameron rather than becoming his coalition partner? No, says Cable. If they\u2019d done that, the Tories would have called an election a few months later and the Lib Dems would have been swept away.He offers some contrition, too, on the issue that dogged the Lib Dems in coalition and since \u2013 tuition fees \u2013 though it takes an unexpected form. The fees increase was necessary, he says, and the basic principle of financing universities through a fee loan system was widely \u201caccepted\u201d. He says he had \u201ca blazing row\u201d with the then party leader Nick Clegg over making a pledge not to raise fees that he regarded as \u201cridiculous\u201d. These days, his campus visits make him confident that the issue has faded among young people: \u201cThey think they\u2019re paying the first stage of what is an effective graduate tax.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a72be29ec434e5f5bd30f8b93d9fc1a4da1e3b72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a72be29ec434e5f5bd30f8b93d9fc1a4da1e3b72/0_170_2992_1795/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nick Clegg helps Vince Cable in Twickenham in the 2015 general election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nick Clegg helps Cable in his effort to retain his Twickenham seat in the 2015 general election.

He doesn\u2019t think it likely, not because he is against coalitions in principle \u2013 although, given what it did to the Lib Dems last time, you wouldn\u2019t blame him \u2013 but because, he says, his party could not make common cause with either a Corbynite Labour party or a Brexiter Tory party. Would Corbyn stepping down be a price of coalition? \u201cIt\u2019s not a personal thing,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019ve no personal antipathy to Jeremy, he\u2019s a perfectly decent guy from my experience. It\u2019s more the leadership of the Labour party and what it represents and its policies which are a problem, not the individual.\u201d He says there\u2019s \u201ca large group of MPs in the Labour party who I would feel perfectly comfortable working with, but not the Labour front bench\u201d. Anyway, he says, all that is a matter for his successor.Looking ahead, he says he won\u2019t give up his seat in the Commons, though if this parliament serves out its full term he will be nearly 80 and won\u2019t stand again. He reminds me that he didn\u2019t even become an MP until 1997 when he was 54, admitting that he occasionally \u201cdaydreams\u201d about what might have been if all this, including the party leadership, had come 20 years earlier. But that delayed start had other advantages: he did a \u201cboring nine-to-five job\u201d (he was chief economist at Shell) that enabled him to get home in time to read to his three children.</p> <p>For now, he will work on that book and a couple of voluntary roles he has with social enterprises. So he won\u2019t follow Clegg\u2019s lead and become a highly paid tech executive? He smiles at the very idea, before insisting he does not feel \u201cmorally fastidious\u201d about Clegg working for Facebook. How much contact does he have with the man he served as deputy? \u201cNone. Or virtually none.\u201d</p> <p>Cable has already had a taste of life away from the frontline. He used his two enforced years outside parliament between 2015 and 2017 to enter a few ballroom tournaments in Blackpool, so surely now is the moment to return to the dancefloor. Would he say yes if Strictly called? \u201cIt would be nice to be asked,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Would he be any good? \u201cI could sail through the ballroom. Even jive I can do, but trying to do rumba and cha-cha, where you need great hip action: that\u2019s more difficult when you get older.\u201d And he never really liked doing it competitively. \u201cDancing on a crowded floor, and you\u2019ve got one and a half minutes and somebody bangs into you and you lose your routine\u201d \u2013 and it takes me a moment to realise he is talking about dancing, rather than the life of a politician on the centre ground, squeezed between the two big parties, waiting for his moment and hoping to get the timing just right.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Vince Cable, the other party leader stepping down this summer, looks like a man ready to hand over. In the Twickenham home he has lived in for 45 years, a table is covered with piles of notes and clippings from the Financial Times \u2013 \u201chorizontal filing,\u201d he calls it \u2013 research for a new book he is working on. It is a study of how major politicians \u201chave changed the way we do economics\u201d, from Alexander Hamilton to Margaret Thatcher and, although he has not made a final decision on this \u2013 because who knows how the story will end? \u2013 Donald Trump. He will soon have more time for that project. Unlike Theresa May, the 76-year-old leader of the Liberal Democrats did not have to be dragged from politics\u2019 front line. It was his decision. But what a way to go. A few months ago, the Lib Dems were down to just 11 MPs. It seemed that theirs was a permanently ruined brand, rendered toxic by five years in coalition with David Cameron\u2019s Tories. The decline was painfully obvious every Wednesday lunchtime, when Cable would have to wait the best part of 45 minutes to be called at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions, long after the leaders of Labour and the Scottish National Party and a string of backbenchers. He and his party were a political afterthought.Any centrist energy was focused on the Independent Group, the breakaway of Labour and Conservative MPs who looked set to gobble up the Lib Dem vote and perhaps the party itself. That changed last month, which began with the Lib Dems making big gains in the local elections in England and ended more spectacularly still, as the party beat Labour into third place in the European elections, grabbing 20.3% of the vote. Now the talk is of the Lib Dems as the obvious repository of the remain vote, the potential home for millions of one-time Tory and Labour supporters disaffected with their parties\u2019 stances on Brexit. Several analysts, including some not given to hyperbole, are musing about a realignment, with the Lib Dems potentially replacing Labour as the lead opponents of Brexit and Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party. Does that mean Cable, handing over just as things are looking up, has had second thoughts? \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t really,\u201d he says. \u201cI made a commitment to the party, to my wife and to myself that I would move on.\u201d He admits that leadership takes its toll: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the physical wear and tear \u2013 dashing around \u2013 it\u2019s the mental pressure. Every time you get a bad opinion poll, it\u2019s quite stressful.\u201d He also means it when he says that he wants to spend more time with his family. \u201cI\u2019m one of those fortunate people who\u2019s been happily married twice,\u201d he says. His first wife, Olympia, died of breast cancer in 2001, and he married Rachel Wenban Smith in 2004. He speaks easily and directly about his love for both women. On the walls there are photos of both wedding days; on his finger there are two wedding rings. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy doing things together,\u201d he says of Rachel. \u201cI want to enjoy that life rather than spend all my remaining days slogging round the political circuit.\u201d Besides, he says, he always saw himself as \u201csomething of a stopgap\u201d leader, right from when he took over in 2017, waiting until the next generation were ready. He does not claim too much personal credit for the Lib Dem renaissance. The local advances, he says, were the fruit of old-fashioned Lib Dem graft: activists plugging away, on the ground, for years. And, undeniably, he adds, the party has benefited from the failings of the big two. The Tories have made \u201cthe most appalling Horlicks\u201d of Brexit, while most Labour MPs privately concede, he says, that their party\u2019s position is \u201chopeless as well as unpleasant\u201d. Will his parting shot to the Lib Dem faithful be a channelling of David Steel, urging them to \u201cgo back to your constituencies and prepare for government\u201d? It won\u2019t, but realignment is, Cable says, \u201cbecoming more than a possibility. Not least because the Tories and the Labour party appear to be doubling down on their existing strategy, which is suicidal in both cases.\u201d It is a big claim, but he sticks with it. Corbynism is not a sustainable strategy for a party of the left in the UK, he says, chiefly for economic reasons. Voters will always demand that Labour\u2019s sums add up. \u201c\u2018Two plus two equals five\u2019 isn\u2019t an election-winning formula, and I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s where they are. Old fashioned state socialism just isn\u2019t remotely where the country is or what it needs.\u201d He still believes in the same vision of a mixed economy he advocated back when he was in the Labour party \u2013 he was one of those who broke off to form the Social Democratic party (SDP) \u2013 describing himself even now as an \u201cold-fashioned social democrat who used to work for John Smith. I probably haven\u2019t moved on in some ways.\u201d As for the Tories, they \u201cseem determined just to dig in behind this kind of English nationalism. Brexit is a proxy for something bigger and deeper.\u201d He fears Conservatives have \u201cchosen to identify themselves with what Isaiah Berlin once called the \u2018politics of the soil\u2019\u201d. It\u2019s a trend that, for Cable, is not just \u201cnasty, but dangerous\u201d. But the two main parties repelling millions of voters was never going to be enough, on its own, to ensure a Lib Dem surge. It helped that the party had a catchy slogan. \u201cBollocks to Brexit\u201d was not Cable\u2019s own coinage: a Lib Dem staffer suggested it, he says, having seen it on a sign attached to Pimlico Plumbers near Waterloo station in south London. Cable was not sure about it at first, but he overcame his hesitation. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be clear than it is to be polite or whatever,\u201d he says Still, another condition had to pertain for the Lib Dems to make the European breakthrough: the party had to have the centre ground all to itself. Happily for the Lib Dems, Change UK (as the Independent Group had renamed themselves) obliged. So what does Cable think went wrong for that new grouping, which last week split in two? \u201cFirst of all, they went too soon.\u201d A second problem, recalls this veteran of the SDP\u2019s founding in 1981, is \u201cif you contrast the leadership today of Change UK with the SDP leadership 30 years ago, we\u2019re talking different league altogether. [Roy] Jenkins, [David] Owen, all the rest of them. And also [the SDP] was incredibly well planned. I mean, they had planned it for two years, and it was done in association with David Steel. It was a really serious attempt to break the mould. This [Change UK] just sort of happened at a fairly low level.\u201cThey rushed into an election without realising that you need an infrastructure to fight an election, and then made elementary mistakes. I mean, it\u2019s sad in a way, because I like the people. We agree with them on almost everything.\u201d (Which is slightly odd, because a moment earlier he had diagnosed Change UK\u2019s greatest problem as \u201cthe fact that they were trying to launch a new organisation which didn\u2019t have any intellectual or political coherence at the heart of it\u201d.) But there was another mistake, says Cable. \u201cI did urge that we work together, but they decided to compete. Anyway, they\u2019ve had, I think, a chastening experience, and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Surely the next step is obvious, and not just between the Lib Dems and Change UK. Isn\u2019t now the moment for an alliance of the key, non-nationalist parties fully committed to remaining in the EU? Given the Westminster electoral system, isn\u2019t that the only way to prevail? If I was expecting equivocation or I\u2019ll-leave-that-to-my-successor boilerplate, Cable doesn\u2019t supply it. Instead, he recalls how his party and the Greens have had an electoral pact for Twickenham council contests that has worked out for both of them. \u201cSo I would be in favour, in principle, of extending that kind of arrangement\u201d nationwide, he says. He knows there will be Lib Dem resistance, and \u201cthere will be Greens who will be going on about the coalition, but \u2026 I personally think that would be a sensible way to conduct an election.\u201d So an alliance of Greens, Lib Dems and, in a handful of seats, Change UK? \u201cYes, if [Brexit] is the dominant issue of the day, it would be absolutely sensible to do it. And I would hope that we would have quite a lot of Labour and Tory [MPs] who would, at an individual level, go along with this as well.\u201d When I use the word merger, he initially resists. \u201cMaybe we\u2019re not talking about merging, we\u2019re just talking about cooperation.\u201d I\u2019m about to rephrase, when he says, \u201cBut one thing leads to another, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d So perhaps a merger of Lib Dems and Greens, until Westminster elections are run under a PR system? \u201cIt could be, yeah.\u201d Let\u2019s say a remain alliance got its way, and Brexit was averted. Does he not worry that will leave behind a furious, pro-Brexit constituency who will feel bitterly, even dangerously, betrayed? He agrees that there will be an angry, \u201ctruculent\u201d minority, but says it\u2019s \u201cfeeble\u201d to suggest remainers should hold their nose and get on with leaving the EU just to pacify that group. \u201cIf anybody\u2019s got any grievance about the democratic system, it\u2019s probably my party, or the Green party, or Ukip for that matter. We\u2019re horribly underrepresented, but we\u2019ve got on with it and done the best we can.\u201d Besides, remainers would have to win a second referendum before they could cancel Brexit and he reckons leavers \u201cwould be substantially mollified if we went through that process\u201d. Still, the European election might have been a one-off, a protest vote: for any kind of alliance to succeed at Westminster, surely the Lib Dems would have to do deeper penance for their complicity in austerity. Cable does not agree. If by austerity you mean the macro-economic policy of reducing the deficit, Cable will defend that with vigour. He believes the coalition was right about that and that a Labour government would have had to do the same.

Would Corbyn stepping down be a price of coalition? \u201cIt\u2019s not a personal thing,\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019ve no personal antipathy to Jeremy, he\u2019s a perfectly decent guy from my experience. It\u2019s more the leadership of the Labour party and what it represents and its policies which are a problem, not the individual.\u201d He says there\u2019s \u201ca large group of MPs in the Labour party who I would feel perfectly comfortable working with, but not the Labour front bench\u201d. Anyway, he says, all that is a matter for his successor.Looking ahead, he says he won\u2019t give up his seat in the Commons, though if this parliament serves out its full term he will be nearly 80 and won\u2019t stand again. He reminds me that he didn\u2019t even become an MP until 1997 when he was 54, admitting that he occasionally \u201cdaydreams\u201d about what might have been if all this, including the party leadership, had come 20 years earlier. But that delayed start had other advantages: he did a \u201cboring nine-to-five job\u201d (he was chief economist at Shell) that enabled him to get home in time to read to his three children. For now, he will work on that book and a couple of voluntary roles he has with social enterprises. So he won\u2019t follow Clegg\u2019s lead and become a highly paid tech executive? He smiles at the very idea, before insisting he does not feel \u201cmorally fastidious\u201d about Clegg working for Facebook. How much contact does he have with the man he served as deputy? \u201cNone. Or virtually none.\u201d Cable has already had a taste of life away from the frontline. He used his two enforced years outside parliament between 2015 and 2017 to enter a few ballroom tournaments in Blackpool, so surely now is the moment to return to the dancefloor. Would he say yes if Strictly called? \u201cIt would be nice to be asked,\u201d he says. Would he be any good? \u201cI could sail through the ballroom. Even jive I can do, but trying to do rumba and cha-cha, where you need great hip action: that\u2019s more difficult when you get older.\u201d And he never really liked doing it competitively. \u201cDancing on a crowded floor, and you\u2019ve got one and a half minutes and somebody bangs into you and you lose your routine\u201d \u2013 and it takes me a moment to realise he is talking about dancing, rather than the life of a politician on the centre ground, squeezed between the two big parties, waiting for his moment and hoping to get the timing just right.",

Some 1,169 architects, curators and professors signed an <a href=\"http://www.artnews.com/2019/04/29/notre-dame-experts-open-letter-macron/\" title=\"\">open letter</a> to Macron, advising him to wait and to think this reconstruction through. \u201cLet us take the time for a proper diagnosis,\u201d stated the letter. \u201cListen to the experts, let\u2019s recognise their knowledge, and then, yes, let\u2019s fix an ambitious deadline for an exemplary restoration.\u201d</p> <p>And polls indicate that more than half the population want the cathedral back just how it was. Last month the French senate <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2019/05/29/restore-notre-dame-cathedral-french-senate/\" title=\"\">passed a bill</a> saying that it should be restored to its appearance immediately before the fire. Yet Macron has approved an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/apr/17/france-announces-architecture-competition-rebuild-notre-dames-spire\" title=\"\">international contest</a> for innovative architectural designs.</p> <p>At the centre of the modernising row is the cathedral\u2019s fallen spire. Designed and built by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc in 1859 and 93 metres high, it was a neogothic masterpiece. As it caught fire and crashed through the roof, a cherished part of Notre Dame disappeared for ever.</p> <p>When Macron declared that \u201ca contemporary architectural gesture\u201d would be an appropriate replacement following the announcement by the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, of the competition to design it, a hashtag soon appeared on social media <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/touchepasanotredame?lang=en-gb\" title=\"\">#TouchePasANotreDame</a> (don\u2019t touch Notre Dame). Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a centre-left writer and campaigner, said that anything other than a complete restoration would \u201cdestroy the soul of Notre Dame\u201d. In a rare moment of political unity across the spectrum, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and the conservative luminary Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy agreed.</p> <p>But the various proposals for something completely different are up and running. The architect Alexandre Chassang has proposed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/15/swimming-pool-roof-notre-dame-architect-proposals-shock-traditionalists\" title=\"\">Shard-like glass spire</a>, which he shared on Twitter, adding: \u201cWe should not copy the past by mimicry.\u201d Whatever is decided, the works at Notre Dame will be a restoration of a Unesco world heritage-listed monument, an operation that must therefore conform with a 1913 law on monuments that limits new additions to such structures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c1939f3de5c17cd219c2cf729d6d2bb59f6210f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c1939f3de5c17cd219c2cf729d6d2bb59f6210f/0_0_1308_785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A proposal by Brazilian architect Alexandre Fantozzi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A proposal by Brazilian architect<strong> </strong>Alexandre Fantozzi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexandre Fantozzi</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The grandson of the original architect, Viollet-le Duc, did not pick a side, but observed that it was \u201ca fascinating debate between the old and the new. It\u2019s a shame that Viollet-le-duc is no longer here to participate, he would have been greatly interested!\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s also a debate that shows how Macron\u2019s gung-ho approach rubs so many French people up the wrong way. In architecture as in politics, Macron is obsessed with innovation: the youngest ever president of France doesn\u2019t want to simply rebuild the cathedral \u2013 he has to improve it. In politics, Macron has a deserved reputation for setting bold targets (such as liberalising swaths of the French economy) and not worrying too much about the details, which can end up sparking months-long protests, such as those by the <em>gilets jaunes</em>. He would like the new cathedral to embody his modernised France.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/06/restoring-notre-dame-guedelon-the-medieval-builders-who-may-have-the-answers\">Notre Dame: time to call in the French builders with medieval skills</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rebuilding the cathedral with time and caution could be the opportunity for a once-in-a-generation project, reconstructing both interior and exterior using traditional woodworking and architectural expertise. Many monuments of the country\u2019s heritage are in dire need of restoration work, too, and Notre Dame could have opened a wider debate in protecting French historical sites. Macron\u2019s vision of grand contests and impossible deadlines for the completion of the scheme simply shines a light on the poor management abilities behind his showmanship.</p> <p>But I suppose we should be thankful for small mercies. At least the Notre Dame escaped a rebranding exercise based on the families and businesses who donated the most money: there will be no cathedral Notre Dame de L\u2019Or\u00e9al.

Macron, in his typically forceful, overambitious style, has also insisted that the cathedral will be back to its best \u201cwithin five years\u201d. \u201cWe are a people of builders,\u201d Macron said the day after the fire. \u201cWe have so much to rebuild.\u201d But instead of being a unifying project, the vexed question of the restoration of the Notre Dame has become a metaphor for the battle between Macron\u2019s modernising \u201cstartup nation\u201d vision of France, and the large number of French citizens who don\u2019t want anything to do with it. Some 1,169 architects, curators and professors signed an open letter to Macron, advising him to wait and to think this reconstruction through. \u201cLet us take the time for a proper diagnosis,\u201d stated the letter. \u201cListen to the experts, let\u2019s recognise their knowledge, and then, yes, let\u2019s fix an ambitious deadline for an exemplary restoration.\u201d And polls indicate that more than half the population want the cathedral back just how it was. Last month the French senate passed a bill saying that it should be restored to its appearance immediately before the fire. Yet Macron has approved an international contest for innovative architectural designs. At the centre of the modernising row is the cathedral\u2019s fallen spire. Designed and built by Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc in 1859 and 93 metres high, it was a neogothic masterpiece. As it caught fire and crashed through the roof, a cherished part of Notre Dame disappeared for ever. When Macron declared that \u201ca contemporary architectural gesture\u201d would be an appropriate replacement following the announcement by the French prime minister, \u00c9douard Philippe, of the competition to design it, a hashtag soon appeared on social media #TouchePasANotreDame (don\u2019t touch Notre Dame). Rapha\u00ebl Glucksmann, a centre-left writer and campaigner, said that anything other than a complete restoration would \u201cdestroy the soul of Notre Dame\u201d. In a rare moment of political unity across the spectrum, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and the conservative luminary Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Bellamy agreed. But the various proposals for something completely different are up and running. The architect Alexandre Chassang has proposed a Shard-like glass spire, which he shared on Twitter, adding: \u201cWe should not copy the past by mimicry.\u201d Whatever is decided, the works at Notre Dame will be a restoration of a Unesco world heritage-listed monument, an operation that must therefore conform with a 1913 law on monuments that limits new additions to such structures. The grandson of the original architect, Viollet-le Duc, did not pick a side, but observed that it was \u201ca fascinating debate between the old and the new. It\u2019s a shame that Viollet-le-duc is no longer here to participate, he would have been greatly interested!\u201d But it\u2019s also a debate that shows how Macron\u2019s gung-ho approach rubs so many French people up the wrong way. In architecture as in politics, Macron is obsessed with innovation: the youngest ever president of France doesn\u2019t want to simply rebuild the cathedral \u2013 he has to improve it. In politics, Macron has a deserved reputation for setting bold targets (such as liberalising swaths of the French economy) and not worrying too much about the details, which can end up sparking months-long protests, such as those by the gilets jaunes. He would like the new cathedral to embody his modernised France. Rebuilding the cathedral with time and caution could be the opportunity for a once-in-a-generation project, reconstructing both interior and exterior using traditional woodworking and architectural expertise. Many monuments of the country\u2019s heritage are in dire need of restoration work, too, and Notre Dame could have opened a wider debate in protecting French historical sites. Macron\u2019s vision of grand contests and impossible deadlines for the completion of the scheme simply shines a light on the poor management abilities behind his showmanship. But I suppose we should be thankful for small mercies. At least the Notre Dame escaped a rebranding exercise based on the families and businesses who donated the most money: there will be no cathedral Notre Dame de L\u2019Or\u00e9al. At least not for now. \u2022 Pauline Bock is a French journalist based in Brussels",

Failures by the CPS to consult on changes to policy and [disregarding] its own guidance developed to tackle the under-prosecution of rape are, we argue, unlawful.\u201d</p> <p>Katie Russell, the national spokesperson for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said: \u201cDespite significant increases in the number of victims and survivors of rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse reporting to the police in recent years, the vast majority of those who\u2019ve been subjected to these traumatic experiences still choose not to pursue criminal justice.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Waxman, the independent victims\u2019 commissioner for London, said:<strong> </strong>\u201cIf the CPS have changed their policy without consultation and it is impacting victims\u2019 access to justice, then this must be remedied immediately.\u201d</p> <p>A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cSexual offences are some of the most complex cases we prosecute and we train our prosecutors to understand victim vulnerabilities and the impact of rape, as well as consent, myths and stereotypes.

The attack had taken place nearly 10 years earlier. \u201cBringing it all up again was traumatic,\u201d she recalled. \u201cThey assured me they could convict him. I recorded a video statement, which took four hours. I had to collect evidence from people with whom I was at university.</p> <p>\u201cLater I discovered they had posted me a copy of the statement but sent it to the wrong address. It went to the house I used to share with my ex-partner. Then they said it had been recorded at the wrong speed and the files were corrupted. If it was done again, I was told, the CPS would not accept it as evidence. Eventually it was re-recorded.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the evidence was my doctor\u2019s notes, which showed I had been complaining about an abusive relationship. The police told me they had the notes but I discovered they had only obtained them for the previous five years \u2013 not when the abuse was happening. I told them they had not got the right medical evidence.</p> <p>\u201cEventually they said my case was being dropped. One of the reasons was that they thought my allowing the ex-partner to \u2018come and stay with me\u2019 was wrong \u2013 but he had turned up at 5am banging on my door so the only solution was to let him in to quieten him down.</p> <p>\u201cI went through two years of pursuing the case.

It was trauma. He did not leave my side all weekend.</p> <p>\u201cThe second time he attacked me he had a huge kitchen knife, so the violence was escalating.

      "bodyText": "The Crown Prosecution Service is to face a judicial review challenge over allegedly covert policy changes that are blamed for a dramatic collapse in the number of rape cases going to court. Fewer than 4% of women who report attacks can now expect their complaint to reach trial, according to a coalition of women\u2019s organisations who accuse the CPS of \u201csecond-guessing jury prejudices\u201d. While the number of rapes reported to the police nearly tripled between 2014 and 2018, the End Violence Against Women Coalition (EVAW) points out that the number of cases charged and sent to court fell by 44%. The problem was revealed last year in the Guardian, which reported that CPS leaders were encouraging prosecutors to drop what they termed \u201cweak\u201d cases. The legal challenge, funded through the CrowdJustice website, argues that the CPS has \u201ccovertly changed its policy and practice in relation to decision-making on rape cases\u201d. A \u201cletter before action\u201d initiating the case has been sent to the CPS. It includes a dossier of 21 cases where decisions have been made not to charge despite allegedly compelling evidence. In some cases suspects were known to be violent. Sarah Green, of EVAW, said: \u201cWe have strong evidence to show that CPS leaders have quietly changed their approach to decision-making in rape cases, switching from building cases based on their merits back to second-guessing jury prejudices. This is extremely serious and is having a detrimental impact on women\u2019s access to justice. \u201cWe are witnessing a collapse in justice after rape at a time when increasing numbers of women are speaking out and reporting these crimes. We\u2019re hearing from women who\u2019ve been raped and they are telling us about cases being dropped for reasons that are hard to understand.\u201d Harriet Wistrich, director of the Centre for Women\u2019s Justice, which represents EVAW, said: \u201cWe are arguing that the CPS\u2019s systemic failure to prosecute rape is a human rights failure and has a discriminatory impact on women, who are the large majority of rape victims. Failures by the CPS to consult on changes to policy and [disregarding] its own guidance developed to tackle the under-prosecution of rape are, we argue, unlawful.\u201d Katie Russell, the national spokesperson for Rape Crisis England and Wales, said: \u201cDespite significant increases in the number of victims and survivors of rape and all forms of sexual violence and abuse reporting to the police in recent years, the vast majority of those who\u2019ve been subjected to these traumatic experiences still choose not to pursue criminal justice.\u201d Claire Waxman, the independent victims\u2019 commissioner for London, said: \u201cIf the CPS have changed their policy without consultation and it is impacting victims\u2019 access to justice, then this must be remedied immediately.\u201d A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cSexual offences are some of the most complex cases we prosecute and we train our prosecutors to understand victim vulnerabilities and the impact of rape, as well as consent, myths and stereotypes. Decisions to prosecute are based on whether our legal tests are met \u2013 no other reason \u2013 and we always seek to prosecute where there is sufficient evidence to do so. \u201cVictims have the right to ask for a review of their case by another prosecutor, independent of the original decision-maker, and this is another way we can make sure we are fair and transparent in what we do.\u201d A report published by the civil liberties organisation Justice on Monday says extra resources are needed to investigate and prosecute sexual offences because of the increase in digital evidence and the rapid escalation in the number of offences being reported. The report, containing 57 recommendations, also calls for complainants not to be called \u201cvictims\u201d during prosecutions \u201cto ensure that the policy of believing the complainant until there is \u2018credible evidence to the contrary\u2019 does not prejudice the suspect\u201d. Judges authorised to deal with sexual offences should be given additional training, it says. Ministers, senior police and prosecutors will meet on Monday to discuss how to improve disclosure of digital evidence. It follows a row over the use of consent forms for digital disclosure after warnings that complainants who deny police access to their mobile phone contents could allow rape suspects to escape charges. The solicitor general, Lucy Frazer QC, the policing minister, Nick Hurd, the director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner Nick Ephgrave, the victims\u2019 commissioner, Dame Vera Baird QC, and representatives from the technology industry will meet in London. Frazer said: \u201cWe need to do more to support police and prosecutors to adapt to the increasing volume of digital material in the criminal justice system.

      "bodyText": "Compensation claims management firms looking for the next big earner after the PPI scandal have been accused of bombarding the much-criticised payday lending sector with complaints that are often spurious and sometimes without the knowledge of borrowers. In some cases the claims could breach strict data protection laws, while success fees charged by the claims companies threaten to add to the financial pressure on people who used payday loans. The payday loan industry has come under heavy fire from politicians, debt campaigners and regulators for charging extortionate interest on short-term loans. Yet while claims management companies (CMCs) portray themselves as consumer champions helping to fight payday lenders, many also charge high fees and have questionable business practices \u2013 often affecting some of the UK\u2019s most vulnerable customers. The Consumer Finance Association (CFA), an industry body for the payday loans sector, said it had seen \u201cworrying tactics\u201d across the claims industry. That included poor quality complaints, data protection issues and complaints made without permission. A CFA spokeswoman said a number of lenders have received more than 1,000 complaints from a single CMC in a 24-hour period in an attempt to \u201cflood lenders with complaints\u201d. The vast majority of the complaints against payday lenders are brought on the grounds of affordability, following a 2014 clampdown on the sector by the Financial Conduct Authority. CMCs have already made billions of pounds from compensation claims over the mis-selling of payment protection insurance. With a deadline for final PPI claims coming in August,CMCs appear to be targeting payday lenders with a high volume of claims as the former look for their next source of profits.

In 2018, Elevate received 4,185 DSARs. CFA figures showed another small lender received 500 DSARs in a single day, while a different lender received about 250 DSARs in one hour. Although CMCs can help people reclaim money they would not have otherwise gained, debt management charities and consumer advice centres recommend people avoid CMCs\u2019 fees by making complaints themselves. CMCs often charge their customers a third or more of the value of any successful claim. For instance, PayDayRefunds charges \u00a3180 in fees on a \u00a3500 claim. The damage done can be compounded for customers with multiple loans with one provider. Money successfully claimed back can legally be returned in the form of a reduction in the remaining amount of money still owed to the lender. However, CMCs will often request their fee in cash directly from the claimant, meaning they can be pursued by yet another creditor. For the lenders, a large volume of complaints without checks \u2013 whether legitimate or not \u2013 represent a serious financial threat. Wonga, the payday lender which became a byword for sky-high interest rates and controversial advertising campaigns, was forced into administration in August after the volume of complaints \u2013 and the related \u00a3550 fee per complaint referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service \u2013 meant it was no longer financially viable. Sunny is another of the payday lenders which has been criticised for charging high fees to consumers. It advertises a representative annual percentage rate of 1,281%, meaning a customer can end up paying back almost double what they borrowed.",

The second anniversary of the blaze is on Friday and tens of thousands of people are still living in dangerous homes, the public inquiry has been beset by delays, and promises to give council tenants a bigger voice have not yet been delivered. Some of the survivors and bereaved are so disappointed by the slow pace of action and angered by what they see as a failure to give priority to their concerns that they are considering boycotting the second phase of the inquiry, which is due to start next year, the Guardian understands. Friday\u2019s commemorations for the 72 people who died in the fire will include a church service, a vigil near the block and a silent evening march through the surrounding streets. Grenfell United, the group of bereaved and survivors, has spent most of the past two years in close contact with cabinet ministers and the prime minister and has concluded that \u201cin most cases those in power simply aren\u2019t interested in acting on our concerns\u201d.

But it is becoming increasingly apparent not only that the system isn\u2019t changing fast enough but that it\u2019s not even going in the right direction.\u201d Two years on from the fire: 17 families remain in temporary accommodation, including one in a hotel, in spite of initial promises by Theresa May that all would be rehoused within three weeks. Tens of thousands of high-rise residents are still living in towers wrapped in banned Grenfell-style cladding, with 338 residential and publicly owned buildings yet to be fixed. An estimated 500,000 social housing tenants have reported the same fault more than 10 times to their landlord in the past three years, according to a poll by the housing charity Shelter. The public inquiry report on what happened on the night of the fire has been delayed until October. A police investigation into possible manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and health and safety offences is not expected to conclude until late 2021, meaning any trials would not start until about five years after the fire. Grenfell United said: \u201cThe community is still suffering, justice has been delayed and it seems the government appears to be backing off from making the changes to social housing needed to prevent another Grenfell.

      "body": "<p>A growing number of Conservative MPs, including some leadership hopefuls, recognise that a second referendum is the only way out of the Brexit conundrum, but are too nervous to put their heads above the parapet, Sam Gyimah, one of the candidates for the top Tory job, has said.</p> <p>Gyimah, who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/dec/01/sam-gyimah-second-brexit-referendum-best-option-for-both-sides\">the only candidate campaigning for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d</a>, said some of his rivals realise that the country is heading for a second referendum when faced with the choice between that outcome and no deal, but they would prefer to have that imposed by parliament. \u201cThere are a number of leadership candidates who recognise this. They don\u2019t want to propose it and they want it done to them rather than say it in the contest,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The former minister said there were \u201csubstantial numbers\u201d of Conservative MPs now ready to accept that returning to the electorate may be the only way to break the impasse.</p> <p>\u201cSupport for a second referendum grows when it is pitted against no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the stark and unwelcome choice we will face under a new prime minister is no deal or a second referendum, and at that point support of Conservative MPs grows even further.</p> <p>\u201cWe are still at the stage where people are nervous of that option, because it is seen as a Lib Dem option, but the only thing that matters is how we pursue the national interest.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/nov/30/sam-gyimah-conservative-brexit-theresa-may\">Sam Gyimah: rising Conservative star who quit over Brexit</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said all the other candidates were engaged in \u201cwishful thinking\u201d about the potential for getting a variation of Theresa May\u2019s deal through parliament, especially those who think Labour MPs would come to the rescue of a Conservative prime minister.</p> <p>Gymiah also accuses his rivals of \u201cnot being straight with the electorate and the country\u201d by offering solutions that \u201cwe know will not work but are politically convenient\u201d \u2013 from renegotiation of the backstop to the idea that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/07/the-guardian-view-on-no-deal-theresa-may-must-expose-it-as-a-fantasy\">\u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d</a>.</p> <p>To those who rule out a second referendum, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not what you want. It\u2019s not what you like. It\u2019s what you can deliver. And there is no other plan out there to break the deadlock in parliament.</p> <p>\u201cWhere this is headed ultimately is going back to the people and letting them back into the process. There is a risk for the Conservative party that Labour get there first. At that point, you have a Conservative party that will struggle politically as it will have set its face against the only path that can bring a resolution via the people.\u201d</p> <p>Gyimah needs to submit the names of at least eight supporters to the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers in order to make it to the next round of the contest, and only about six Tory MPs have publicly campaigned for a second referendum.</p> <p>However, he highlighted the 15 Tories who voted for a confirmatory ballot on a deal and roughly 20 who abstained during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/25/the-brexit-options-as-mps-aim-to-break-commons-deadlock\">indicative votes process</a>, warning his colleagues that it would be better to lead the country on the issue of a people\u2019s vote than to be forced to accept it by Labour.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a growing number of Conservatives who increasingly recognise this is the reality but don\u2019t want to put their heads above the parapet,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not measuring my success simply by what happens in the leadership contest. It is about where we are headed and trying to move my party along to that position so that we own that solution rather than eventually having to follow the opposition.\u201d</p> <p>Labour has not yet unequivocally moved to campaigning for a second referendum, but Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support a confirmatory ballot on any deal negotiated with Brussels.</p> <p>Gyimah, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/30/sam-gyimah-resigns-over-theresa-mays-brexit-deal\">resigned from the government last year</a> because he could not support May\u2019s deal, said it was important now for a second referendum not to be seen as a Liberal Democrat or Labour solution, but one that could be supported by everyone across the political divide in order to bring closure.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the unfortunate things is that a second referendum has been tainted by remain, when in actual fact it is a process that will lead to an outcome,\u201d he said, backing a two-stage question of leave versus remain and then deal versus no deal. \u201cThe country can still vote leave very loudly if it wants to. Then remoaners would have to shut up. But we\u2019ve got to get beyond the current divide.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to Donald Trump\u2019s style of politics, Gyimah also hit out at the \u201cTrumpian machismo\u201d of other candidates, who were all competing on \u201chow hard a Brexit can you offer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve now got to a situation where renegotiating a backstop is what tame people offer. If you really want to be tough, you\u2019ve got to contemplate proroguing parliament to deliver no deal. This is the problem. The debate is moving further and further towards the extremes. Now, if you mention a Norway-style deal, that is seen as a proxy for remain. That is incredibly worrying.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "A growing number of Conservative MPs, including some leadership hopefuls, recognise that a second referendum is the only way out of the Brexit conundrum, but are too nervous to put their heads above the parapet, Sam Gyimah, one of the candidates for the top Tory job, has said. Gyimah, who is the only candidate campaigning for a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d, said some of his rivals realise that the country is heading for a second referendum when faced with the choice between that outcome and no deal, but they would prefer to have that imposed by parliament. \u201cThere are a number of leadership candidates who recognise this. They don\u2019t want to propose it and they want it done to them rather than say it in the contest,\u201d he said. The former minister said there were \u201csubstantial numbers\u201d of Conservative MPs now ready to accept that returning to the electorate may be the only way to break the impasse. \u201cSupport for a second referendum grows when it is pitted against no deal,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the stark and unwelcome choice we will face under a new prime minister is no deal or a second referendum, and at that point support of Conservative MPs grows even further. \u201cWe are still at the stage where people are nervous of that option, because it is seen as a Lib Dem option, but the only thing that matters is how we pursue the national interest.\u201d He said all the other candidates were engaged in \u201cwishful thinking\u201d about the potential for getting a variation of Theresa May\u2019s deal through parliament, especially those who think Labour MPs would come to the rescue of a Conservative prime minister. Gymiah also accuses his rivals of \u201cnot being straight with the electorate and the country\u201d by offering solutions that \u201cwe know will not work but are politically convenient\u201d \u2013 from renegotiation of the backstop to the idea that \u201cno deal is better than a bad deal\u201d. To those who rule out a second referendum, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s not what you want. It\u2019s not what you like. It\u2019s what you can deliver. And there is no other plan out there to break the deadlock in parliament. \u201cWhere this is headed ultimately is going back to the people and letting them back into the process. There is a risk for the Conservative party that Labour get there first. At that point, you have a Conservative party that will struggle politically as it will have set its face against the only path that can bring a resolution via the people.\u201d Gyimah needs to submit the names of at least eight supporters to the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers in order to make it to the next round of the contest, and only about six Tory MPs have publicly campaigned for a second referendum. However, he highlighted the 15 Tories who voted for a confirmatory ballot on a deal and roughly 20 who abstained during the indicative votes process, warning his colleagues that it would be better to lead the country on the issue of a people\u2019s vote than to be forced to accept it by Labour. \u201cThere is a growing number of Conservatives who increasingly recognise this is the reality but don\u2019t want to put their heads above the parapet,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not measuring my success simply by what happens in the leadership contest. It is about where we are headed and trying to move my party along to that position so that we own that solution rather than eventually having to follow the opposition.\u201d Labour has not yet unequivocally moved to campaigning for a second referendum, but Jeremy Corbyn has said he would support a confirmatory ballot on any deal negotiated with Brussels. Gyimah, who resigned from the government last year because he could not support May\u2019s deal, said it was important now for a second referendum not to be seen as a Liberal Democrat or Labour solution, but one that could be supported by everyone across the political divide in order to bring closure. \u201cOne of the unfortunate things is that a second referendum has been tainted by remain, when in actual fact it is a process that will lead to an outcome,\u201d he said, backing a two-stage question of leave versus remain and then deal versus no deal. \u201cThe country can still vote leave very loudly if it wants to. Then remoaners would have to shut up. But we\u2019ve got to get beyond the current divide.\u201d Referring to Donald Trump\u2019s style of politics, Gyimah also hit out at the \u201cTrumpian machismo\u201d of other candidates, who were all competing on \u201chow hard a Brexit can you offer\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve now got to a situation where renegotiating a backstop is what tame people offer. If you really want to be tough, you\u2019ve got to contemplate proroguing parliament to deliver no deal. This is the problem. The debate is moving further and further towards the extremes. Now, if you mention a Norway-style deal, that is seen as a proxy for remain. That is incredibly worrying.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Dutee Chand, India\u2019s fastest sprinter and the nation\u2019s first athlete to reveal she is in a same-sex relationship, doesn\u2019t describe herself as gay. When the word is used during an interview with the Guardian, she breaks in. \u201cI didn\u2019t tell reporters I was that ... I simply said I am in a relationship with a woman,\u201d she says. Chand comes from a village in India where homosexuality is never talked about. Unlike urban India where there is growing acceptance among the young of notions of personal freedom, rural India remains largely entrenched in tradition, and tradition says marriage is between a man and a woman. \u201cIt is going to take time for people in my village to get used to the idea,\u201d Chand says, referring to the backlash that her coming out in May prompted among some residents of her home village, Chaka Gopalpur in Odisha, in eastern India. Having previously supported her running and taken pride in her becoming the first Indian woman to qualify for the 100-metre sprint at the Olympics, some villagers have since decried Chand for \u201chumiliating\u201d them. But she doesn\u2019t see them as bigoted. Nor is it the case that she is no longer welcome in the village or feels threatened there. The displeasure is not aggressive. \u201cThey don\u2019t know anything different from what tradition tells them so I am not angry with them,\u201d she says. Nonetheless, she adds: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean to say I am not going to follow my heart. I can\u2019t spend my life worrying about others. No one can live without love.\u201d This is a classic Chand remark, spoken with clarity. \u201cI believe everyone should have the freedom to be with whoever they decide they want to be with \u2026 Any rule which deprives someone of happiness is wrong ... there is no greater emotion than love and it should not be denied.\u201d \u2018This is who she is and what she wants\u2019 That Chand, 23, has become a trailblazer for LGBT rights in India is remarkable. She grew up with a father who used to spend a month weaving two saris on his handloom for which he was paid 200 rupees (\u00a32). This sum supported his wife and their five daughters and son. The family lived, ate, and slept in one room. \u201cWhen I began running at the age of 10, I didn\u2019t have the diet athletes need. It was just rice and vegetables. Every day,\u201d she says. Her elder sister Saraswati, who had put the village on the map as a national-level sprinter, encouraged Chand to take up running, not as a path to fame and money but for the modest goal of getting a low-level government job. Saraswati is now a policewoman. She was Chand\u2019s mentor for years but is now an \u201cenemy\u201d, as Chand says, claiming that Saraswati betrayed her by telling the media about her love for another woman without her permission. Chand grew up worshipping Usain Bolt for his running style. Another idol was South African legend Caster Semenya. Ever since she began winning medals, Chand has been used to positive media coverage and the glow of public acclaim. Her silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta was India\u2019s first medal in the women\u2019s 100m in 20 years. At the same meet Chand also won silver in the 200m. She followed it up with a bronze in the 200m at the Asian Championships in April this year, along with a near personal best time in the 100m as she attempts to qualify for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. Her coming out in May was praised as courageous by many sections of Indian society. But the media attention about her private life has shaken her. She is concerned for her partner who also comes from a poor weaving family.

The Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has offered the Coalition a lifeline, suggesting that the minor party \u201cwould love to give hardworking Australians a tax cut\u201d if it was confident income tax rebates would not cause cuts to services down the line. If the Coalition can persuade the Australian Conservatives senator Cory Bernardi to pass the package, then it will need the support of the returning Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie to support the package if Labor and One Nation refuse to pass it in the way the government presents it. Hanson said she will not support the Morrison government\u2019s entire tax cut package \u201cat this stage\u201d because she thinks there are other more important priorities. The One Nation leader told the Nine Network on Monday: \u201cI think there is more important issues out there that are of concern to the Australian people. \u201cI want to see a coal-fired power station built in Australia to reduce the electricity prices and I want to see the Bradfield scheme to ensure water security in Australia.\u201d Hanson said those initiatives would \u201cbring employment to Australia, water security, cheaper electricity, keep our industries manufacturing in the country\u201d. She also said it was important \u201cto the people\u201d to have a royal commission into family law and child support: \u201cMen are suiciding daily and women have been murdered. \u201cYet the government\u2019s reluctant to do anything about it.

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this blog is for people watching season two of Big Little Lies, which airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK. Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode one.</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018So. Who are we planning to kill?\u2019</h2> \n<p>The single-series wonder is a rare TV phenomenon, and for a short time, it seemed as if <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/big-little-lies\">Big Little Lies</a> was a prime candidate to deliver a short, sharp, one-off shock. The 2017 series covered all of the Liane Moriarty novel upon which it was based, and wrapped up its central story neatly. Season one ended with the abusive Perry, played with such simmering menace by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, being revealed as the rapist father of Jane\u2019s son Ziggy. After he publicly beat his wife Celeste, Bonnie pushed him down the stairs, killing him. The group of women covered it up and had a lovely picnic on the beach with the kids. The end.</p> \n<p>But it wasn\u2019t, because Big Little Lies was far too successful to bury. So here we are, picking up at the start of another school year, as the mystery is opened up. As soon as the opening credits introduced the women leading this show, I broke into an inner cheer. What a cast! The risks of it doing a Homeland \u2013 continuing into far-fetched silliness when it could have been so crisp and tidy \u2013 were a concern, but on the basis of this first episode, it is very much top-quality business as usual, with an added and welcome garnish of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep\">Meryl Streep</a> at her absolute Streepiest.</p> \n<p>Perry may be dead, but he is still haunting Monterey. All of the Liars are back, and nobody is quite okay. Madeline (a brilliantly chippy Reese Witherspoon) has become even more Madeline, high-octane and incessantly upbeat and productive. Celeste (Nicole Kidman) is having recurring nightmares about her husband\u2019s death and his violence towards her, and as her therapist points out, she keeps his legacy alive by continuing to blame herself for it. Bonnie (Zoe Kravitz), who did the pushing, has withdrawn completely, and is being consumed and isolated by her own sense of guilt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"358f8f1d0e34b85e4adc90971961d383fd19e2da\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/358f8f1d0e34b85e4adc90971961d383fd19e2da/0_41_5579_3348/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stillness, poise and rage ... Meryl Streep as Mary Louise\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stillness, poise and rage ... Meryl Streep as Mary Louise</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The set-up so far is that they have just about got away with it \u2013 for now. But when Jane\u2019s colleague asks if she is one of the Monterey Five, and when Renata says the police are at a loss \u2013 \u201cThe case isn\u2019t <em>closed</em>, closed, but they got nothing\u201d \u2013 it is made very clear that this is the calm before the storm, and the winds are about to change.</p> \n<p>And I think we all know who will change them. Mary Louise (Streep) proves terrifying from the second we first meet her, her stillness and poise masking rage and her suspicions that Perry\u2019s death was not the accident that people were made to believe. She is part Kathy Bates in Misery, part <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/14/ann-dowd-interview-handmaids-tale-hulu-leftovers\">Aunt Lydia</a>, and wholly alarming. The family dinner at the end was the most tense on-screen meal since the end of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/doctor-foster--episode-by-episode\">Doctor Foster</a>\u2019s first series, and that scream was a howl of agony and rage.</p> \n<p>If Josh and Max have not yet picked up their father\u2019s habits (the bullying of Amabella last season, and the fork-stabbing at the table, suggest it might be time to intervene already), then Mary Louise\u2019s approach to child-rearing should give them a push. The episode ends with Mary Louise interrupting another of Celeste\u2019s giveaway nightmares: \u201cSo.

      "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this blog is for people watching season two of Big Little Lies, which airs on HBO in the US and Sky Atlantic in the UK. Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched episode one. \u2018So. Who are we planning to kill?\u2019 The single-series wonder is a rare TV phenomenon, and for a short time, it seemed as if Big Little Lies was a prime candidate to deliver a short, sharp, one-off shock. The 2017 series covered all of the Liane Moriarty novel upon which it was based, and wrapped up its central story neatly. Season one ended with the abusive Perry, played with such simmering menace by Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, being revealed as the rapist father of Jane\u2019s son Ziggy. After he publicly beat his wife Celeste, Bonnie pushed him down the stairs, killing him. The group of women covered it up and had a lovely picnic on the beach with the kids. The end. But it wasn\u2019t, because Big Little Lies was far too successful to bury. So here we are, picking up at the start of another school year, as the mystery is opened up. As soon as the opening credits introduced the women leading this show, I broke into an inner cheer. What a cast! The risks of it doing a Homeland \u2013 continuing into far-fetched silliness when it could have been so crisp and tidy \u2013 were a concern, but on the basis of this first episode, it is very much top-quality business as usual, with an added and welcome garnish of Meryl Streep at her absolute Streepiest. Perry may be dead, but he is still haunting Monterey. All of the Liars are back, and nobody is quite okay. Madeline (a brilliantly chippy Reese Witherspoon) has become even more Madeline, high-octane and incessantly upbeat and productive. Celeste (Nicole Kidman) is having recurring nightmares about her husband\u2019s death and his violence towards her, and as her therapist points out, she keeps his legacy alive by continuing to blame herself for it. Bonnie (Zoe Kravitz), who did the pushing, has withdrawn completely, and is being consumed and isolated by her own sense of guilt. The set-up so far is that they have just about got away with it \u2013 for now. But when Jane\u2019s colleague asks if she is one of the Monterey Five, and when Renata says the police are at a loss \u2013 \u201cThe case isn\u2019t closed, closed, but they got nothing\u201d \u2013 it is made very clear that this is the calm before the storm, and the winds are about to change. And I think we all know who will change them. Mary Louise (Streep) proves terrifying from the second we first meet her, her stillness and poise masking rage and her suspicions that Perry\u2019s death was not the accident that people were made to believe. She is part Kathy Bates in Misery, part Aunt Lydia, and wholly alarming. The family dinner at the end was the most tense on-screen meal since the end of Doctor Foster\u2019s first series, and that scream was a howl of agony and rage. If Josh and Max have not yet picked up their father\u2019s habits (the bullying of Amabella last season, and the fork-stabbing at the table, suggest it might be time to intervene already), then Mary Louise\u2019s approach to child-rearing should give them a push. The episode ends with Mary Louise interrupting another of Celeste\u2019s giveaway nightmares: \u201cSo. Who are we planning to kill?\u201d Notes and observations Amid all the violence and brutality, I had forgotten quite how funny this show is. From Madeline\u2019s awful snobbery to Renata haranguing the teacher, to the outrageous over-the-top villainy of Mary Louise\u2019s putdowns, it really can be a hoot. Yet it remains as subtle as it ever was when it comes to women and violence, and women questioning their complicity in what has been done to them. When Mary Louise dismantled Madeline for a second time, while simultaneously pretending to apologise, I thought Madeline\u2019s neon pink heels were very Legally Blonde. We were so used to seeing Jane running away from something, and blocking out the world, that to watch her dancing on the beach, carefree, was touching. The incredible Andrea Arnold (Red Road, Fish Tank, American Honey) has taken over on directorial duties. Along with David E Kelley, Liane Moriarty receives a \u201cstory by\u201d co-credit for this season. So far, there appears to be very little evidence that Perry was pushed, other than the suspicions of his mother, but I\u2019m guessing that the cheques Celeste has been giving Jane might one day be cashed, and might be the start of a paper trail? Playlist Jane and Ziggy dance around their apartment to Joan Jett\u2019s ever brilliant Bad Reputation; later, when Jane is dancing on the beach, she\u2019s listening to Mystery of Love by Sufjan Stevens (from the Call Me By Your Name soundtrack). As the families descend on the school corridors for the start of a new year, we hear The Spinners\u2019 I\u2019ll Be Around. Renata is on a soul tip \u2013 she\u2019s playing Jimmy Ruffin\u2019s What Becomes of the Brokenhearted in the car, and her fabulous Wonder Woman-esque gold belt photoshoot plays out, pointedly perhaps, to It\u2019s My House by Diana Ross. The soundtrack to Abigail\u2019s righteous teen optimism is The Rip by Portishead. Celeste gets ready for the dinner from hell with Cassandra Wilson\u2019s gorgeous cover of Harvest Moon. There\u2019s a brief appearance from Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s version of All Apologies by Nirvana, too. Quote of the week \u201cI find little people to be untrustworthy.\u201d Mary Louise has quite the toolbox for unsettling her opponents, and she is more than a match for Madeline.",

We just need to be a little bit more brave, a little bit more composed on the ball. \u201cWe need to shift the focus to Brazil and see what personnel will best suit us for that game. We have the potential to get through to the next stage, it\u2019s just that now we\u2019ve decided to go the long way about it and the hard way about it. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s just the Australian way, so we\u2019ll stare it straight in the eyes and we\u2019ll go for it.\u201d With the potential for up to three teams to get through the group, the obituaries for the 2019 campaign are a little premature. But should the Matildas come up short against Brazil in Montpellier not even the most charitable of interpretations will keep the knives unsheathed.",

      "bodyText": "Defence agencies are refusing to say whether they consulted the then defence minister Marise Payne before referring leaks of classified information to the Australian federal police. The AFP has confirmed that it began its investigations into the ABC\u2019s report of alleged unlawful killings by Australian troops in Afghanistan and Annika Smethurst\u2019s report of plans to extend spy powers after it received referrals from agency heads in July 2017 and August 2018 respectively. Payne was the relevant minister for both the defence department and the Australian Signals Directorate at the time of the referrals. Both agencies refused to respond to questions from Guardian Australia about whether they had consulted Payne before asking the AFP to investigate, with the Department of Defence saying it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to respond. The AFP faces the possibility of two inquiries into its widely condemned actions when parliament resumes next month. The chair of the committee overseeing law enforcement agencies, Craig Kelly, has pledged to review the AFP\u2019s conduct, while crossbench senators are also pushing for a separate Senate probe. Labor\u2019s shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally, has said a Senate inquiry is \u201can option open to the opposition\u201d, but it would still require the full support of the crossbench to become a reality. The ABC is also considering taking legal action over the raid, its chair confirmed on Monday. Ita Buttrose said the broadcaster had consulted lawyers about its options but had not \u201cbriefed anybody yet\u201d. \u201cAt this point, we\u2019re really assessing the allegations to see what actions can be taken and we want to make sure that we\u2019re in the strongest available position to defend ourselves and also our journalists,\u201d Buttrose told ABC radio. Matthew Collins QC, president of the Victorian Bar Council, confirmed he had been retained by the ABC but could not comment further. Buttrose said she would be meeting the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about the raid this week. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell the prime minister what to do but I will tell him how we feel at the ABC and how I feel,\u201d she said. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, has claimed the AFP\u2019s investigation happened at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d from the government, saying he had been aware the investigation was under way, but had no prior knowledge of the media raids. Under the AFP\u2019s guidelines, matters where the execution of a search warrant may have \u201cpolitically sensitive implications\u201d should be raised with the minister responsible for the AFP, by the relevant minister or department at the time of the referral. \u201cThis enables the government to be informed at the earliest juncture of potentially politically contentious matters that may require investigation by the AFP,\u201d the guidelines state. As the government faces sustained pressure over the nature of the raids, the former defence secretary and former head of Asio Dennis Richardson said agencies needed to be \u201ccautious\u201d about referrals to the AFP. \u201cIf you refer a matter to the AFP they take control of that, and it goes where it goes \u2013 they drop some, they pursue others,\u201d Richardson told ABC radio. \u201cThis one \u2026 was a matter referred to them two years ago and it pops out of the woodwork now. That to me is not unusual, but I do think that it points to the fact that you need to be cautious in what you refer to the AFP if you don\u2019t want it to surprise you down the track.\u201d He said he understood the \u201cemotional reaction\u201d to the raids, but believed it was \u201cmisplaced\u201d to suggest the AFP was trying to intimidate the media. \u201cIt might have had the consequence of that, but everything I know about the AFP would lead me to believe that the AFP is not in the space of deliberately setting out to intimidate the media.\u201d With Australian Associated Press",
