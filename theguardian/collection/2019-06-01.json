This ability to mix things up and tailor their approach to different opponents is arguably one of their biggest strengths and could serve them well in France. After all, four years ago in Canada, Mark Sampson\u2019s England won the bronze medal after Neville\u2019s predecessor changed personnel, formation and tactics in every game. Sometimes the Lionesses were very attacking, sometimes extremely cagey.</p> <p>Sampson was compensating for the presence of only one player in the world\u2019s top 40 \u2013 Karen Carney \u2013 among his squad but, even though that number has now quadrupled, and Neville\u2019s side are stronger technically, England still cannot quite dominate all-comers courtesy of a single hallmark style. Granted, they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/06/japan-england-women-shebelieves-cup-match-report\">won the SheBelieves Cup</a> in the United States this spring but home friendly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/05/england-women-canada-international-friendly-match-report\">defeats against Sweden and Canada</a> raised concerns.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/womens-world-cup-2019-team-guide-no-12-jamaica\">Women's World Cup 2019 team guide No 12: Jamaica</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the Lionesses are to reach the latter stages, their manager will surely need to rotate and tinker but the good news is that his squad possesses the necessary depth and variety. Neville has tended to alternate between 4-3-3 and 4-2-3-1 but the latter formation brings out the best in Fran Kirby, the gifted Chelsea playmaker, facilitating her deployment in a classic No 10 role. Kirby\u2019s ability to play between the lines appears integral to England\u2019s chances while Jade Moore and Jill Scott represent a well balanced central midfield pairing.</p> <p>Even so, the catalytic creativity of the injured attacking midfielder Jordan Nobbs will be missed. Defensively, England are strong with Steph Houghton and Millie Bright a formidable central partnership and Lucy Bronze, probably the world\u2019s best right-back, offering a dynamic attacking outlet. Neville has experimented with Bronze in central midfield but she seems most effective at full-back. He appears spoiled for attacking choice with Kirby, Nikita Parris, Toni Duggan, Beth Mead, Ellen White and Jodie Taylor all capable of delivering goals.</p> <p>His dilemma is which combination to pick and how best to calibrate a front three or four which cries out for the injured Nobbs\u2019s reassuring amalgam of invention and defensive nous. With Nobbs on the pitch the danger of England being overrun in central midfield diminished. Perhaps most importantly, Neville also needs to find a way of bringing the best out of Taylor, the leading scorer at Euro 2017 and, arguably, still his most dangerous striker.</p> <h2><strong>Coach</strong></h2> <p>In an ideal world Phil Neville would recreate the glorious tactical anarchy of the swashbuckling Manchester United side he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson but, realistically, will probably needs to locate his \u201cinner Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u201d if England are to triumph. The twin brother of England netball coach Tracey Neville, he loathes scruffiness and has raised smartness levels while lowering the squad\u2019s average age. As an England player Neville missed the final cut for three World Cups; this is his moment to compensate.</p> <h2><strong>Star player</strong></h2> <p>Born in Berwick, right on the border with Scotland, Lyon\u2019s Lucy Bronze spent part of her childhood growing up on tiny Holy Island, or Lindisfarne, off the north Northumberland coast before later moving to Alnwick. Widely regarded as the world\u2019s best right-back, she played for boys teams until the age of 12 when the FA banned her. After starting her career with Sunderland, she won a sports scholarship to the University of North Carolina but underwent four knee operations before the age of 23. The former Manchester City player is half Portuguese \u2013 through her father \u2013 and, a decent linguist, now also speaks fluent French.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"011ef286598828a11a740c78702ea43c682031ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/011ef286598828a11a740c78702ea43c682031ca/199_317_5304_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England\u2019s Lucy Bronze is widely regarded as the world\u2019s best right-back.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England\u2019s Lucy Bronze is widely regarded as the world\u2019s best right-back.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Did you know?</strong></h2> <p>Forward Ellen White\u2019s trademark, fingers circling eyes, goal celebration is copied from her favourite player, FC K\u00f6ln\u2019s French striker Anthony Modeste. The Birmingham star and her husband Callum are big fans of both German football \u2013 and the city of Cologne \u2013 and follow every step of Modeste\u2019s career.</p> <h2><strong>Brief history of women\u2019s football in England</strong></h2> <p>The women\u2019s game was born in England during the 1890s, with Preston, where the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2009/sep/09/england-women-football\">trailblazing Dick, Kerr Ladies</a> were founded in 1894, emerging as its early powerbase. Dick, Kerr Ladies\u2019 Boxing Day game against St Helens Ladies in 1920 saw 53,000 fans congregate inside Goodison Park with thousands locked outside. Earlier that year they had beaten a French XI 2-0 in front of 25,000 in the first women\u2019s international. A deeply disturbed FA duly took fright and, in 1921, banned women\u2019s football from all grounds used by its affiliated men\u2019s clubs. The pompous, and patronising, reasoning was that \u201cfootball was quite unsuitable for females\u201d. That remained the official view until 1969 when English women, embracing the rebellious spirit of a decade when they began kicking balls again, formed the independent WFA. In 1971 the FA finally lifted the ban forbidding them from playing on affiliated grounds but it would be another 22 years until the ruling body finally brought the women\u2019s game under its auspices.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/england-women-new-zealand-world-cup-talking-points\">England Women 0-1 New Zealand: five World Cup warmup talking points | Louise Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hope Powell became England\u2019s first full-time coach in 1998 and, seven years later, England hosted the 2005 European Championship. The foundation of the FA Women\u2019s Super League came in 2011 and the national team have reached the last four of the past two major tournaments \u2013 the World Cup in 2015 and the Euros two years later.</p> <h2><strong>Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup</strong></h2> <p>Beth Mead. Topped the WSL scoring charts during her Sunderland days and, despite being converted to a winger since joining Arsenal, she has scored five goals in 12 England appearances. Capable of playing anywhere across the front line, Mead\u2019s emergence dictates that even Barcelona\u2019s Toni Duggan is not guaranteed a starting place.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3d933ad462c835c90cf6a09105f7238198d6953\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3d933ad462c835c90cf6a09105f7238198d6953/0_0_1427_930/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Mead slides in to score against Spain during an international friendly at Swindon\u2019s County Ground in April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beth Mead slides in to score against Spain during an international friendly at Swindon\u2019s County Ground in April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: JasonPix/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>What is the realistic aim for England in France and why?</strong></h2> <p>After reaching the semi-finals of both Canada 2015 and Euro 2017, the ambition is to win the tournament. Anything less than a last-four place will represent disappointment but navigating a potentially hazard-strewn road to Lyon may prove tougher than envisaged. At least the Lionesses look virtually certain to progress from an initial group also featuring Argentina, almost certainly the tournament\u2019s weakest team, Japan and Scotland.</p> <h2><strong>Annual England women\u2019s football budget</strong></h2> <p>According to the most recent accounts, the FA\u2019s annual spend on women\u2019s football was \u00a317.7m out of an overall \u00a3125m budget and that was the biggest investment in the women\u2019s game of any European association.</p> <h2><strong>Number of registered players</strong></h2> <p>There are 1,831 FA affiliated women\u2019s teams in England and 4,073 affiliated girls teams. The total (affiliated and not affiliated) number of women aged 16 and over playing in England is now 1.8m and the number of girls (age five to 15) playing is 900,000. The latter two stats cover all frequencies and formats.</p>",

Defensively, England are strong with Steph Houghton and Millie Bright a formidable central partnership and Lucy Bronze, probably the world\u2019s best right-back, offering a dynamic attacking outlet. Neville has experimented with Bronze in central midfield but she seems most effective at full-back. He appears spoiled for attacking choice with Kirby, Nikita Parris, Toni Duggan, Beth Mead, Ellen White and Jodie Taylor all capable of delivering goals. His dilemma is which combination to pick and how best to calibrate a front three or four which cries out for the injured Nobbs\u2019s reassuring amalgam of invention and defensive nous. With Nobbs on the pitch the danger of England being overrun in central midfield diminished. Perhaps most importantly, Neville also needs to find a way of bringing the best out of Taylor, the leading scorer at Euro 2017 and, arguably, still his most dangerous striker. Coach In an ideal world Phil Neville would recreate the glorious tactical anarchy of the swashbuckling Manchester United side he played in under Sir Alex Ferguson but, realistically, will probably needs to locate his \u201cinner Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u201d if England are to triumph. The twin brother of England netball coach Tracey Neville, he loathes scruffiness and has raised smartness levels while lowering the squad\u2019s average age. As an England player Neville missed the final cut for three World Cups; this is his moment to compensate. Star player Born in Berwick, right on the border with Scotland, Lyon\u2019s Lucy Bronze spent part of her childhood growing up on tiny Holy Island, or Lindisfarne, off the north Northumberland coast before later moving to Alnwick. Widely regarded as the world\u2019s best right-back, she played for boys teams until the age of 12 when the FA banned her. After starting her career with Sunderland, she won a sports scholarship to the University of North Carolina but underwent four knee operations before the age of 23. The former Manchester City player is half Portuguese \u2013 through her father \u2013 and, a decent linguist, now also speaks fluent French. Did you know? Forward Ellen White\u2019s trademark, fingers circling eyes, goal celebration is copied from her favourite player, FC K\u00f6ln\u2019s French striker Anthony Modeste. The Birmingham star and her husband Callum are big fans of both German football \u2013 and the city of Cologne \u2013 and follow every step of Modeste\u2019s career. Brief history of women\u2019s football in England The women\u2019s game was born in England during the 1890s, with Preston, where the trailblazing Dick, Kerr Ladies were founded in 1894, emerging as its early powerbase. Dick, Kerr Ladies\u2019 Boxing Day game against St Helens Ladies in 1920 saw 53,000 fans congregate inside Goodison Park with thousands locked outside. Earlier that year they had beaten a French XI 2-0 in front of 25,000 in the first women\u2019s international. A deeply disturbed FA duly took fright and, in 1921, banned women\u2019s football from all grounds used by its affiliated men\u2019s clubs. The pompous, and patronising, reasoning was that \u201cfootball was quite unsuitable for females\u201d. That remained the official view until 1969 when English women, embracing the rebellious spirit of a decade when they began kicking balls again, formed the independent WFA. In 1971 the FA finally lifted the ban forbidding them from playing on affiliated grounds but it would be another 22 years until the ruling body finally brought the women\u2019s game under its auspices. Hope Powell became England\u2019s first full-time coach in 1998 and, seven years later, England hosted the 2005 European Championship. The foundation of the FA Women\u2019s Super League came in 2011 and the national team have reached the last four of the past two major tournaments \u2013 the World Cup in 2015 and the Euros two years later. Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup Beth Mead. Topped the WSL scoring charts during her Sunderland days and, despite being converted to a winger since joining Arsenal, she has scored five goals in 12 England appearances. Capable of playing anywhere across the front line, Mead\u2019s emergence dictates that even Barcelona\u2019s Toni Duggan is not guaranteed a starting place. What is the realistic aim for England in France and why? After reaching the semi-finals of both Canada 2015 and Euro 2017, the ambition is to win the tournament. Anything less than a last-four place will represent disappointment but navigating a potentially hazard-strewn road to Lyon may prove tougher than envisaged. At least the Lionesses look virtually certain to progress from an initial group also featuring Argentina, almost certainly the tournament\u2019s weakest team, Japan and Scotland. Annual England women\u2019s football budget According to the most recent accounts, the FA\u2019s annual spend on women\u2019s football was \u00a317.7m out of an overall \u00a3125m budget and that was the biggest investment in the women\u2019s game of any European association. Number of registered players There are 1,831 FA affiliated women\u2019s teams in England and 4,073 affiliated girls teams. The total (affiliated and not affiliated) number of women aged 16 and over playing in England is now 1.8m and the number of girls (age five to 15) playing is 900,000. The latter two stats cover all frequencies and formats.",

By any metric just being present two years in a row was a sublime achievement for the players, the management, the owners, the \u2013 God help us \u2013 brand.</p> \n<p>Plus of course the story follows its own arc. It is easy to forget that Klopp\u2019s first game in England was against these opponents, a 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane marked by a series of slightly wild collisions as that game of counter-press found a ragged first expression. This was a bookend: same teams, different stage, different energy, different scale.</p> \n<p>How did we get here? Nothing has been thrown away. The parts have been glossed and greased and worked at by a manager who, for all his talk of energy and fun, is a meticulous coach. Not to mention a coach who can read his club and the people around it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/02/mo-salah-liverpool-spurs-champions-league\">Mo Salah says photo of Kyiv pain inspired him to score against Spurs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Shortly after that hug with Klopp Alexander-Arnold left the main body of Liverpool players and scuttled across a little naughtily to the red end all on his own to punch the air and take that wall of answering happiness.</p> \n<p>There is a kind of \u201cthird-way\u201d football capitalism in all this. Liverpool under Klopp has been a pointedly inclusive project, geared to connect with something other than simply success on the pitch. Those hedge fund owners have invested brilliantly - not just in themselves or in the team (heavily) but in the ground and its surrounds, in understanding the importance of that connection. Alexander-Arnold embodies this. Aged 20 a sporting life won\u2019t, can\u2019t get much better.</p> \n<p>Another thing that makes a champion team: champion players. If this game really did have to be pointed one way by a moment of chance 22 seconds in, it was probably right that the man stepping up to benefit should be Mohamed Salah.</p> \n<p>What was Moussa Sissoko pointing at? Deep in the right hand of side of his penalty area, faced by Sadio Man\u00e9, who had stopped and was looking around for a pass, Sissoko raised his right arm like a boxing padman offering a target to hit. Man\u00e9 obliged.</p> \n<p>Salah waited four times longer than the game had already run for the air to settle. His first touch was to spank the penalty kick hard and straight down the middle. After that Salah was poor here. There was a buzz when he took the ball. But he looked undercooked and cobwebbed. It is a part of Salah\u2019s charm that he has these moments when he looks suddenly like someone playing with the dog in the garden, or having a morning kick-about on the beach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/jun/01/liverpool-tottenham-champions-league\">No miracle finish for Tottenham after Moussa Sissoko\u2019s nightmare start | David Hytner</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Which is quite a quality in a player who really should be winning the Ballon d\u2019Or from here. It an early call, although not that early given the rhythm of the season, but Salah is surely the front-runner now. The top scorer for the champions of Europe. Twenty-nine goals this season. The supreme cutting edge in this team. And also a thrilling, uplifting presence, all ferreting imagination, unusual angles, carefree moments in the middle of all that hustle.</p> \n<p>Salah\u2019s first game for Liverpool was at Watford in August 2017. He scored then as well. Seven members of the Liverpool team that day started here. Divok Origi, hammer of Barcelona and scorer of the second here, played that day. Jo\u00ebl Matip who pushed the ball to Origi to score also played that day.</p> \n<p>The team that drew with Watford are now champions of Europe. Klopp\u2019s mania for coaching and improvement has been mixed with power signings to fill the holes (Alisson was magnificently solid here). It is a beautiful accomplishment; and a lesson in building that is, even now, likely to run and run.</p>",

It is easy to forget that Klopp\u2019s first game in England was against these opponents, a 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane marked by a series of slightly wild collisions as that game of counter-press found a ragged first expression. This was a bookend: same teams, different stage, different energy, different scale. How did we get here? Nothing has been thrown away. The parts have been glossed and greased and worked at by a manager who, for all his talk of energy and fun, is a meticulous coach. Not to mention a coach who can read his club and the people around it. Shortly after that hug with Klopp Alexander-Arnold left the main body of Liverpool players and scuttled across a little naughtily to the red end all on his own to punch the air and take that wall of answering happiness. There is a kind of \u201cthird-way\u201d football capitalism in all this. Liverpool under Klopp has been a pointedly inclusive project, geared to connect with something other than simply success on the pitch. Those hedge fund owners have invested brilliantly - not just in themselves or in the team (heavily) but in the ground and its surrounds, in understanding the importance of that connection. Alexander-Arnold embodies this. Aged 20 a sporting life won\u2019t, can\u2019t get much better. Another thing that makes a champion team: champion players. If this game really did have to be pointed one way by a moment of chance 22 seconds in, it was probably right that the man stepping up to benefit should be Mohamed Salah. What was Moussa Sissoko pointing at? Deep in the right hand of side of his penalty area, faced by Sadio Man\u00e9, who had stopped and was looking around for a pass, Sissoko raised his right arm like a boxing padman offering a target to hit. Man\u00e9 obliged. Salah waited four times longer than the game had already run for the air to settle. His first touch was to spank the penalty kick hard and straight down the middle. After that Salah was poor here. There was a buzz when he took the ball. But he looked undercooked and cobwebbed. It is a part of Salah\u2019s charm that he has these moments when he looks suddenly like someone playing with the dog in the garden, or having a morning kick-about on the beach. Which is quite a quality in a player who really should be winning the Ballon d\u2019Or from here. It an early call, although not that early given the rhythm of the season, but Salah is surely the front-runner now. The top scorer for the champions of Europe. Twenty-nine goals this season. The supreme cutting edge in this team. And also a thrilling, uplifting presence, all ferreting imagination, unusual angles, carefree moments in the middle of all that hustle. Salah\u2019s first game for Liverpool was at Watford in August 2017. He scored then as well. Seven members of the Liverpool team that day started here. Divok Origi, hammer of Barcelona and scorer of the second here, played that day. Jo\u00ebl Matip who pushed the ball to Origi to score also played that day. The team that drew with Watford are now champions of Europe. Klopp\u2019s mania for coaching and improvement has been mixed with power signings to fill the holes (Alisson was magnificently solid here). It is a beautiful accomplishment; and a lesson in building that is, even now, likely to run and run.",

VAR was supposed to be used in that, too, and would have been of tremendous benefit to Wydad Casablanca after their equaliser against Esp\u00e9rance was chalked off for an incorrect offside. But despite intense lobbying by Wydad staff and players, the referee refused to consult Var \u2013 apparently because he couldn\u2019t: the company that provides the technology claimed they told organisers before the game that airlines had lost some of their equipment in transit so Var would not be operational for the match, a detail that the organisers allegedly did not disclose to the teams beforehand. \bSo after the non-goal, play was stopped as players and officials argued on the pitch and sidelines for <em>an hour and a half</em> before Wydad announced they had no faith in the organisers and would not play.

class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Preamble</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello and welcome to coverage of the 64th European Cup/Champions League final, the ninth featuring Liverpool and the very first one with Tottenham Hotspur. Not many people expected Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team to make it this far but now that they are here, thanks to two of the most dramatic victories in the tournament\u2019s history \u2013 first over Manchester City and then over Ajax \u2013 they intend to make off with the big prize. Just imagine! Tottenham: European champions despite not being English champions since 1961, back when Elvis\u2019s Wooden Heart was top of the hit parade!</p> \n  <p>For now, though, that is still just a wild dream for Spurs, and Liverpool intend to make sure it stays that way. They have been authors of some spectacular dramas themselves this season \u2013 just ask Lionel Messi \u2013 and they want this trophy badly. They came agonisingly close to lifting it last season, just as they came agonisingly close to lifting the Premier League this season, and they will be distraught if they do not leave Madrid today as kings of Europe for a sixth time. But not for one second will J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men be anticipating a straightforward win. </p> \n  <p>It matters not a jot that Liverpool have already beaten Spurs twice this season en route to finishing 28 points above them on the domestic front. Sure, Liverpool know they can hurt Spurs but they and we are also well aware that Spurs have the tools to trouble them. This battle promises to be a belter. There are many, many ways it could be decided and many wonderful players who will play roles in tilting it one way or the other. </p> \n  <p>In a few hours the old big-eared trophy will be heading to an English city beginning with L but for now we can\u2019t say more than that other than (1) don\u2019t get your hopes up, Lincoln, and (2) Bring It On! <strong>Kick-off is at 8pm, BST. </strong></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T19:01:02.627Z\">at 8.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Klopp certainly enjoyed his night in Madrid ... Not a perfect end for Spurs, as David Hytner points out ... Virgil van Dijk is next in the room. He\u2019s proved to be a decent signing... And now you can see what J\u00fcrgen Klopp has to say. Presumably he\u2019s pleased \u2013 he\u2019s just seen Sid Lowe\u2019s player ratings: Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s press conference is now live \u2013 skip to the end of the video above to watch. Here is Daniel Taylor\u2019s report from Madrid ... \u201cWe need to feel very proud of the effort, how we fought to get to this final. We were very unlucky to concede that goal from the penalty. We played so well in the second half. It\u2019s not easy to play against a team that plays transition very well, taking risks. I feel so proud. We were a little bit unlucky. Being 1-0 down from the start changed the plans completely. It\u2019s not easy. But having been in the Champions League final for the fist time, we have to be optimistic for the future. \u201cIt\u2019s about learning. Use this experience like Liverpool did last year. I\u2019m so pleased to manage this group of players and I congratulate Liverpool because they\u2019ve had a fantastic season. When you live this experience, you want to do it again, to play in the best game in the world after the World Cup.\u201d Just to prove that not all presidents tweet dangerous nonsense, Senegal\u2019s Macky Sall has taken to social media to congratulate his compatriot Sadio Man\u00e9 for the \u201ctalent, discipline and humility\u201d that have helped make him a European champion. Chapeau. \u201cWithout the manager this is impossible. What he\u2019s done in this club is incredible. Not only the players he\u2019s brought in that have made us stronger, but he\u2019s also made the players who were already here better.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m so proud to be part of this football club. I\u2019ve just tried to give my best every time I\u2019ve played football ad help the team. There\u2019s been tough times over my career but I\u2019ve kept going. This is what you\u2019ve done it for. This is the best moment of my life apart from [having] my children.\u201d And to think, back in 2012 Brendan Rodgers was trying to usher Henderson out of the club as he bartered for Clint Dempsey ... and most people at the time (including me) thought that would have been a decent deal. Hats off to Henderson for proving his worth in the most delicious style. Here are Liverpool fans celebrating at the final whistle. It looks like they enjoyed it. While Liverpool milk the glory, Pochettino is probably in the dressing room telling his players to watch and remember their hurt, so they can use it as fuel to go a step farther next time. But he should also reflect on his own decisions here. He got the key selections wrong. Winks did not have the impact he hoped after two months out injured, and nor did Kane, who was allowed to stay on the pitch until the end despite offering next to nothing. At least those players had excuses: some of the others, notably Eriksen, don\u2019t. That said, most Liverpool players were no better, but that bit doesn\u2019t matter now. \u201cI\u2019m so happy for the boys, I\u2019m so happy for all of these people, I\u2019m so happy for my family..... Did you ever see a team like this? Fighting with no fuel in the tank any more. And we had a goalkeeper who makes difficult things look easy. Tonight this is going to be great. This may be the best night of my life, professional wise.\u201d \u201cThis is so important. We have our owners who never put pressure on us, they only support and say \u2018you can deliver this\u2019. They are brilliant.\u201d Asked how he intends celebrating he says: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Normally when I win, 20 minutes after the game I am already half-pissed ...\u201d The look on Klopp\u2019s face as he thrust the trophy skywards, surrounded by his players, will make for a priceless picture. His team were way below par today and he knows what would have been said if they had been punished with defeat, his seventh in a row in a final. Instead his team prevailed and, with this trophy now under their belt, they are likely to become far more formidable. You\u2019d say this could be the beginning of a dynasty ... if Manchester City weren\u2019t around. As each player takes turns hoisting the trophy high, Liverpool fans serenade them with a lusty and slightly relieved rendition of You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. Most Spurs fans appear to have left ... Liverpool are at the summit of Europe! Liverpool\u2019s players bounce up to collect their medals and then gather and dance around the trophy, which Jordan Henderson will soon hold aloft. Liverpool give their opponents a guard of honour as Spurs\u2019 players troop up to collect their runners-up medals. They don\u2019t even glance at the trophy standing next to the Uefa president handing out the medals. Liverpool know that pain from last season, and they\u2019ve made amends. A besuited Ian Rush plonks the trophy on its pedestal as Liverpool players stand beside the podium awaiting permission to go grab it... Salah: \u201cEverybody is happy now! I\u2019m very glad to play the second final in a row and the full 90 minutes, finally. It wasn\u2019t a good performance from any of us individually but that doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201d Alexander-Arnold: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to even put into words what;s just happened. With the season we\u2019ve had we deserved it more than any other team. We\u2019ve beaten everyone put in our path, We were probably dominated for the main part of the game but we showed we\u2019re a world class side and can win any way. When we look back tonight we\u2019re not going to think it was a sluggish game, we\u2019re going to think we\u2019ve just won the European Cup! I\u2019m just a normal lad from Liverpool who\u2019s dream just come true.\u201d Origi: \u201cWe\u2019ve done it. I\u2019m happy that I could play my part but every single guy fought so hard today.\u201d Des Kelly of BT nabs Salah for an interview, then notices that the rest of the Liverpool team are about to sprint off in unison towards the red-clad fans for a big loving cheer: so he advises Salah to dash off and join his teammates, which the Egyptian does with gusto. It\u2019s all smiles and back slaps among the Liverpool players. And Pochettino, classy to the end, walks among them to shake hands and congratulate them, after commiserating with his own players. Liverpool are European champions for the sixth time! Don\u2019t bother telling them it was a boring final because they don\u2019t care! Mohamed Salah and Divock Origi scored the goals that mean a wonderful season for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s team most definitely did not end in an anti-climax. They are legends! Klopp has his first trophy with the club he has transformed and uplifted, and Spurs leave with a lot of credit for making it this far, but regrets with how flat they fell on the big stage. 90+4 min: You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone is reverberating around the stadium as Spurs flail around in search of consolation. It\u2019s not happening. 90 min: There will be at least five more minutes ... 90 min: Joe Gomez is a Champions finalist, having just come on in place of Man\u00e9. 89 min: Fabinho\u2019s role in that goal was nice. HE showed coolness as the ball bobbled around the area to flick it to Origi, who finished perfectly. For a player who seldom starts, Origi has scored some huge goals for Liverpool. It\u2019s going to take a comeback better that surpasses anything we\u2019ve seen so far this season for Spurs to prevent Liverpool from winning this now. Spurs fail to clear a corner from Milner, and Liverpool work it to Origi in the left-hand side of the box. The Belgian steads himself and smacks a good low shot into the far corner! 86 min: Tripper delivers an outswinger ... Moura meets it eight yards out, shotting into the ground ... Son tries to redirect it towards goal from close range but heads over! He was offside anyway. but Moura\u2019s chance was a good one, if only he\u2019d caught it properly! 85 min: Eriksen goes for the far corner ... and Alison springs to his right to push it behind for a corner. 84 min: Rose beats Milner to a dropping ball at the edge of the area and then goes down under contact from the midfielder. Freekick to Spurs on the right-hand side of the box, close to the corner. Eriksen nudges it a little closer to the corner to give himself a more favourable shooting position... 83 min: Milner is the latest player to muck up a corner, failing to beat the first defender. 82 min: Spurs substitution: Llorente on, Alli off. 80 min: Son unloads one from out of the blue, from 25 yards. It\u2019s struck hard and true and Alisson parries it with difficulty. Spurs get it back into the danger area quickly and Moura fires off a low toe-punter. Alisson saves this one more easily. Liverpool need to wake up. 78 min: Liverpool have dropped back and challenged Spurs to open them up. They work Trippier into space down the right and he clips over a dainty cross. Alli gets his nut to it but sends his effort over from seven yards. And, it turns ut, he fouled Matip anyway so Liverpool have a freekick. 77 min: I\u2019m not sure that Kane has touched the ball in this half. 75 min: A Liverpool attack founders and suddenly Spurs are on the charge. Son tries to run through the heart of their defence and for a moment it looks like he can do it, but then Van Dijk shifts into top gear and eases him off the ball. 74 min: Spurs substitution: Dier on, Sissoko off. The Frenchman may have been injured, he seemed to pick up a strain of some sort. 73 min: The game is loosening up now. Quality isn\u2019t exactly soaring but gaps are opening up. Son skitters towards the Liverpool area and slips the all wide to Alli, who tries a dinky, Deulofue-esque lob over Alisson. But he doesn\u2019t catch it right and it\u2019s a comfortable save for the keeper. 71 min: Alison catches the Spurs\u2019 defence out with a quick long kick to Salah, wide on the right. Salah finds Man\u00e9 at the edge of the area but he runs into trouble, allowing Spurs to clear. 70 min: Vertonghn flights a fine long pass from deep to Tripper wide on the right. The fullback delivers a fine cross in the danger zone ... but there\u2019s no teammates there to get on the end of it! 69 min: Man\u00e9 skins Eriksen in midfield and scampers towards the box, zipping the ball in to Salah near the penalty spot. Salah lays it back to Milner, who takes one touch and then lashes a low effort just wide from the edge of the box! Good play! 67 min: Alexander-Arnold donks a pitiful corner to the near post, where Son whacks clear. Even the setpieces have been diabolical today, except for Salah\u2019s penalty. 66 min: Spurs substitution: Moura on, Winks off. Eriksen drops a little deeper. 65 min: At the risk of repeating myself, this is very scrappy. Neither team can string a series of passes together. This is a great advertisement for rugby, or ice hockey or drinking. 62 min: Another Liverpool substitution: Milner on, Wijnaldum off. The Dutchman made no impression. 60 min: \u201cEriksen needs a big game now, he has hid so many times this season,\u201d snaps Mark Goodchild. NO sign of him here yet. And on that note, he tries a shot from 30 yards. It\u2019s a low whizzer than Van Dijk blocks at the edge of the area. 58 min: Liverpool substitution: Origi on, Firmino off. The Brazilian has not looked fit and was unable to make much of a contribution. Same goes for Kane, who I expect to be replaced by Moura soon. I can\u2019t see any justification for leaving him on the pitch. 57 min: Alisson punches a away the corner to the edge of the area. Rose tires to lash it back at goal but Salah deflects it wide. Vertonghen meets the corner beyond the back post but can only guide a soft header a couple of yards over the bar. 56 min: Son tries to wriggle into the box and deliver a cross. Robertson makes a block at the expense of a corner. 55 min: Robertson curls over a vicious cross from the left. Lloris does well to snaffle it before Man\u00e9 can pounce. 54 min: Wijnaldum releases Salah with a cute pass from deep. The Egyptian heads into the box, from the right-hand side. Vertonghen stands up to him ... and Salah tries to use him as a blind as he aims a curler towards the far corner. But Vertonghen is wise to his game and blocks. 53 min: A nice cross from the right by Alexander-Arnold floats just beyond Salah. \u201cIf this doesn\u2019t pick up, this might end up being the worst Champions League final ever,\u201d snalrs Kari Tulinius. \u201cI can\u2019t remember a duller spectacle. Admittedly I missed the Milan-Juve nil-nil in 2003, but every Champions League final has been full of incident and fun. Anyway, here\u2019s hoping for a crazy second half.\u201d I\u2019ll give you a duller spectacle: Red Star Belgrade 0-0 Marseille in the 1991 final, which, like this one, was painful because both teams had been so thrilling on their way to the final. Mind you, back then the problem was that Red Starr decided early on to play for penalties: here it\u2019s that neither team can get going. 49 min: It\u2019s still very scrappy. You know that both managers will have urged the players before kickoff to do their utmost to ensure they don\u2019t come away full of regrets. Well, whoever loses this will agonise for ever over their non-performance ... unless they buck up their ideas pronto. 47 min: Spurs build well down the right, with Trippier releasing Son and then following up to receive the layback. He hoists a cross to the back post, over Alexader-Arnold. Alli tries to head it back across goal but misdirects it. 46 min: Spurs get the second half going... Here comes the players. Let\u2019s hope they were all given a good boot up the backside during the break... \u201cAs a Spurs fan you wonder how many ways we can invent to shoot ourselves in the foot,\u201d drawls Mike Nagle. \u201cSissoko has been great all season but to flail your arms around in the penalty area is dumb. The match needs to liven up. I hope Kane gets a hat trick but it was equally dumb to start him &amp; leave out Moura, the hat trick hero. If you had to include Kane leave Ali out, he has been poor most of the season. Here\u2019s hoping for a better second half.\u201d \u201cI hope Spurs come back and win simply because I want Liverpool to go down in history as the only team to lose two Champions League finals in a row,\u201d snips Greg Rollins, who just doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. Juventus and Valencia have previously lose two finals in a row. In the BT studio, all the talk is about the penalty decision, partly because there\u2019s not been much else to discuss apart from the non-performances of so many fine players. All the pundits- except Glenn Hoddle - think giving a penalty was the right decision because Sissoko\u2019s arm was outstretched (he was pointing at a position where he wanted a teammate to go) and therefore he blocked Mane\u2019s pass illegally. Hoddle contends that that might have been a fair interpretation if the ball had struck his arm directly but since it rebounded on to his arm off his chest, it\u2019s a bad call. \u201cI live for the final, the showpiece, on many occasions it lets you down, but it\u2019s still unmissable,\u201d says Bernard Folan. \u201cThis game is simply abysmal. While not a fan of spurs, if they could string two passes together they could win this. Danny Rose is the only player not afraid of the situation, fair balls to him. Pochettino could win this, winks off, Moura on.\u201d Or Kane off. Liverpool go for their tea with a one-goal lead thanks to Salah\u2019s penalty in the first minute. But there\u2019s not much else for them to be pleased about because this has been a messy half in which Spurs have passed slightly better. It was jittery fare and quite a grim spectacle, evidence that the three-week buildup was too long: can\u2019t help thinking that if this match had been played one week after the end of the Premier League, it would have been a more vibrant affair. Kane and Firmino wouldn\u2019t have been fit for that, of course, but neither of them have had any impact here so far. Let\u2019s hope for a big improvement in the second half from both teams. Victory is there for either one, even if Liverpool currently have the edge. 45 min: Another Spurs attacking initiated by Son concludes with Eriksen shanking a shot 10 yards over from the edge of the area. Symptomatic off a dreadful first half, truth be told. 44 min: Spurs spring forward on a three-on-three attack! But Alli botches it by overhitting a pass intended for Son. That\u2019s easy pickings for Alisson. 43 min: A change of strategy as Salah takes the corner. He might not get another one, as this went straight to Son at the near post. The Korean walloped it away. 41 min: Vertonghen is back in the action, just in time to see Liverpool elevate the quality of this game a tad. After promising bursts by Henderson and Firmino, Alexander-Arnold wins a corner, which he takes himself. Spurs scramble it out for another one, on the far side. 39 min: Vertonghen is receiving treatment, seemingly to an injured elbow. he looks to be in quite a bit of pain. 38 min: Thats more like it! Matip spoon a decent pass wide to Robertson on the left. The Scot hurries forward and unloads a stinging shot from distance that Lloris pushes over with one hand! 37 min: Truth be told, this has been only marginally better than the first half of Arsenal-Chelsea the other day. It\u2019s all very well English teams hogging all the final spots, but it\u2019s be nice if they put on a bette show than this. 35 min: Superb play by Henderson, up to a point. He did well to cut out a loose lofted pass by Alderweireld inside the Tottenham half, and then cleverly headed into space where he could run on to it himself down the right. But then he spaffed his cross out of play. 34 min: Kane, who\u2019s barely been involved so far, flicks the ball on to Son, Spurs\u2019 most dangerous player. Two Liverpool players converge on him near the byline and deflect his cross out of play. 32 min: Sissoko, in the D, tries to slip a pass through to Son, dashing in from the left. Matip makes a critical interception. 30 min: It\u2019s been a strange game. Quite slow, possibly because of the heat, and a little scruffy, possibly because of nerves. You get the feeling that if one team can truly pull themselves together, they could take this game away from the opposition. Liverpool have the lead but aren\u2019t really flowing. 27 min: A Foul on Man\u00e9 gives Liverpool a freekick about 35 yards out, bang central. Alexander-Arnold fancies it. But he doesn\u2019t shoot, instead he drops a cross to where he hoped runners would be. But there was no one there. 25 min: A pause in play as Trippier receives treatment after being caught by Robertson. Nothing much to it. By the way, regarding the penalty in the first minute: if they\u2019re going to be giving spotkicks for handballs in that situation - Sissoko could not get out of the way - then expect players to start aiming for opponents\u2019 hands from close range. 24 min: Another Liverpool corner. Another delivery by Alexander-Arnold, this time short to Henderson, who whips it in. Winks heads clear. 23 min: Robertson sends over a fine cross from the left. His counterpart, Rose, does brilliantly to clear it at the backpost. Liverpool are improving ... 22 min: Lloris gets a good punch to Alexander-Arnold\u2019s delivery, which was deposited right on top of the keeper. They appear to have identified the keeper as a weakness. 21 min: Salah scurries infield from the left and swaps passes with Firmino before opening fire from 20 yards. His shot is deflected behind for a corner. 20 min: Spurs are exerting serious pressure around the box now. They\u2019ve got their passing going and are making Liverpool look a little lethargic, as if they scored too early. 19 min: Sissoko does well to get between Robertson and the ball as the Scot flew down the left. Then the Frenchman sees it out of play for a goalkick. 17 min: Fabinho wins the ball in midfield and nudges it to Henderson, who brings Alexander-Arnold into lay. From 30 yards wide on the right the youngster unleashes a stinging low drive, which whistle just past the post. 16 min: It\u2019s quite a slow game at the minute. The onus is on Spurs to do something to discomfort Liverpool but so far they haven\u2019t come up with anything despite having plenty of the ball. But Liverpool would be well advised to do more to get more of the ball. 14 min: Vertonghen sprays a fine 60-yard crossfield pass to Tripper, who knocks it back to Eriksen. The Dane eschews the chance to cross it into the box, where several teammates were waiting, and instead plays it backwards, losing momentum. 12 min: Matip clatters into Kane wide on the right. Not bad enough for a booking, and Spurs waste the freekick. 11 min: Man\u00e9 wins a corner for Liverpool. Alexander-Arnold delivers. Lloris, surrounded by players, gets a weak punch on it, but a teammate completes the clearances, whacking it way downfield. 9 min: Dangerous dribbling by Son down the left and into the box. Lovely quick feet, almost reminiscent of Moura for his second goal against Ajax. Except that this time Henderson intervenes. When the ball breaks to a Spurs player 25 yards out, Sissoko smashes it high and wide. 8 min: Spurs are having plenty of the ball, as Liverpool decide not to press high and instead lure their opponents forward and try to strike on the counter. 6 min: Alexander-Arnold, the youngest player to start successive finals in the history of the Champions League, does well to dispossess Alli and welly the ball clear. 5 min: Tripper curls an in-swinging corner into the danger zone, where Van Dijk leaps above Veretonghen and heads clear. 4 min: Spurs win a corner after Alli nicks the ball off Alexander-Arnold at the corner of the box. 3 min: If this season\u2019s Champions League has reminded us of anything, it\u2019s that one-goal leads are nothing. Maybe Spurs will let in another two before they\u2019re roused to action ... The Egyptian hammers it past Lloris, who dived the right way but couldn\u2019t stop it. What a start! Sissoko unintentionally blocked a pass by Man\u00e9 with his arm! It hit his chest first and rebounded on to his arm. 1 min: The 2019 Champions League final is go! Liverpool get it going, with Firmino knocking the ball backwards to Van Dijk, who spanks it wide towards the right-hand corner. Before kickoff, there is a minute\u2019s applause in memory of Jos\u00e9-Antonio Reyes, the former Arsenal player who died today in a car accident at the age of 35. \u201cI\u2019m at the O\u2019Hare (Chicago) *international* terminal and the restaurant with two TVs is showing a baseball game and horse racing features,\u201d wails Gregory Crawford. The players enter the arena to a soundtrack of the Champions League jingle played live by violinists flanking the exit of the tunnel. When they stop, the crowd roar their approval for everything that is about to take place. It\u2019s nearly on! The teams are in the tunnel ... \u201cMy underwear is blue and I am regretting it,\u201d sighs Robert Smith (I always thought he was QPR fan). \u201cI may be commando by the 13th minute if LFC are off to a slow start.\u201d Just like heaven, eh. \u201cIt\u2019s about 00:17 hrs in Mumbai, India, and my six-month old daughter has decided to stay up and chuckle at the telly,\u201d writes Irshad Daftari. \u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be a long night, either way.\u201d \u201cI appreciate Simon McMahon\u2019s support,\u201d announces Matt Dony. \u201cBut I\u2019ll level with you; I\u2019m scared. Terrified. Like, amazingly scared. Liverpool proved in the league that they are objectively better than Spurs. But. But. But, it means nothing. It\u2019s a night where I can\u2019t really think for myself, and I have to rely on cliches. Anything could happen. It\u2019s the hope I can\u2019t stand. Argh!!!! Football!!!\u201d The atmosphere in the stadium is reaching wonderpoint. It looks close to full and both sets of fans are singing their hearts out. A far, far better vibe than for that Europa League final on Wednesday. Pochettino is asked whether he is sure kane is 100% fit. \u201cAre you serious?\u201d he replies. \u201cWe believe and feel that in the last few weeks he was ready to compete. We gave him time to feel the motion and combination and yesterday he confirmed he was ready to play. Klopp\u2019s take on Kane\u2019s selection: \u201cWe expected it. But even if Lucas Moura would have played, the quality is massive that they have up front.\u201d \u201cEven in one family, the Champions League has gone global,\u201d announces Keith Leslie. \u201cI\u2019m watching here in Portland, Oregon, one son is watching in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, while my other son is watching in Kathmandu, Nepal. Our friends glued to their tubes in Seattle, Washington, DC, Bangkok and even balmy England. I\u2019ve been an American Reds fan since the drama of Istanbul and can\u2019t wait for more heroics today!\u201d Very good. I\u2019m sitting in my underwear in my front room. \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to watch the final with my three week old daughter,\u201d reveals Kyle Green. \u201cI hope she brings us luck. Come on you Reds!\u201d You do realise that if Liverpool win, you\u2019re now going to have to have a child before every major final they play, right? \u201cNot that it\u2019s bothered me for the past 35 years, but when Liverpool won Big Cup on penalties in 1984 against Roma, it really should have been Dundee United they were facing,\u201d sobs Simon McMahon. \u201cImagine that - England v Scotland in the biggest club game in Europe, in the days when you actually had to be league champions to take part. Much to admire about both sides tonight, and may the best team win, though with ex-United lad Andy Robertson a key player, I\u2019m siding with Matt Dony\u2019s Liverpool.\u201d Public service announcement: \u201cA fan has parked his van in the square where I live in Madrid,\u201d writes Geoffrey Goff. \u201cCan you put out a message to warn him that it will be towed away by the police UNLESS it is moved by 7am local time tomorrow because the square is part of the huge Rastro weekly street market? If you don\u2019t know the area, this is not at all clear\u2026 It is a company van owned by [company name redacted in case the van driver didn\u2019t have permission to drive to Madrid in it] from Essex. It must belong to a fan and I\u2019d hate him or her to wake up to the news that their vehicle is in the police pound, especially after driving all the way here! Thanks and I hope someone will see the message who can pass it on\u2026\u201d \u201cNot that anyone from London or Liverpool cares, but it\u2019s impressive to see seven former Southampton FC players in the Champions League final,\u201d notes Andrew Read. Plus a former Saints manager, of course. \u201cIf Liverpool win I don\u2019t like football anymore and won\u2019t get into a conversation about it,\u201d chirps Oliver Atkinson. \u201cYours sincerely, a Manchester united fan living about 20 miles south of Liverpool.\u201d I don\u2019t get it: who are Manchester United? \u201cI loved the email about lucky G&amp;Ts,\u201d yelps Toias Peggs. \u201cI\u2019m doing everything possible or to make the universe pull the same trick again. I\u2019m a Brit in NYC and a long suffering Spurs fan. I happened to be back in England for the semi second leg - and am now sat here in my New York apartment sat in the same shirt, jeans, underwear, socks and shoes I wore on that magical night. Come on universe. And come on your spurs!\u201d Crystal Palace\u2019s chairman, Steve Parish, is in Madrid today. Surely not negotiating the transfers of Wilf Zaha and Aaron Wan-Bissaka already? Maybe, maybe not, but\u2019s also found some fan\u2019s ticket and told how they can be reunited with it: The teams are out limbering up on the pitch. Judging by the sounds, there are ore Liverpool fans in the stadium at the moment than Spurs, because there were loud boos as the north Londoners took to the field. \u201cDo you have a special Champions League Final routine to limber up your typing fingers or is it business as usual?\u201d inquires Peter Oh. For special occasions like this I only wash my fingers with five-euro bottles of water. So yeah, they\u2019re filthy. \u201cIf tonight\u2019s proceedings were a film, I\u2019d call it A Wish Called Wanda, with quality performances, some biting comedy and a happy ending for Liverpool. The loser will feel like they\u2019ve had chips stuffed up their nose. I wonder if the local Atletico fans will be rooting for Liverpool, as Spurs\u2019 white uniform has more than a faint whiff of Real?\u201d Let\u2019s talk about the goalkeepers. Alisson has very occasional moments of laxity with the ball at his feet but is otherwise immaculate. He clearly gives confidence to his defenders. Hugo Lloris, on the other hand, may has had a sketchy season and a bit. He\u2019s still capable of magnificent saves but also of odd lapses and rash decision-making. It seems silly to stay of a captain who lifted the World Cup last summer and could lift the Champions League today, but he\u2019s a weakness in my book. \u201cI spent the semi-final return leg in a godawful Premier Inn room in Aintree, probably the only place in Merseyside that night where no-one appeared to be watching the match or, indeed, to be alive,\u201d reveal Phil Sawyer. \u201cI watched it on my laptop drinking cans of warm supermarket gin and tonic and eating cold potato wedges, and it was one of the best nights of my life. So tonight I\u2019ve stocked up on more tins of generic supermarket G&amp;T, and the wedges are already cooling. I reserve the right to run down to Lincoln Travelodge and make an immediate booking if, as I suspect, the Reds are three down at half time.\u201d Admit it, you started tucking into that bargain G&amp;T hours ago. Alex Kay-Jelski, sports editor for The Times, has been tweeting about his experience trying to make it to the stadium. \u201cSpanish police scarily aggressive. Towards kids too. Creating trouble, not helping with anything #ucl. They\u2019ll literally pushing people who are just walking down the street. Massively aggressive. I\u2019ll be amazed if all fans in ground in time for KO. Being funneled into single file up against railings. Dangerous.\u201d A disturbing dispatch from a man in the stadium: \u201cHello Paul, it\u2019s a disgrace in the Liverpool end - five euro for water,\u201d emails Kris Pugh. \u201cEveryone has been on the ale all day. Been debating with the staff they weren\u2019t bothered.\u201d That\u2019s outrageous exploitation. So Kane starts, as does Harry Winks, who has also been out of action since for the last seven weeks. Pochettino is going for it. That augurs well for the spectacle. For what it\u2019s worth, if it\u2019s going to be a ding-dong, I foresee Liverpool winning, possibly like in the emphatic style of old. Tottenham: Lloris; Trippier, Alderweireld, Vertonghen, Rose; Eriksen, Winks, Sissoko, Son; Alli; Kane Subs: Vorm Gazzaniga, Sanchez, Lamela, Wanyama, Dier, Walker-Peters, Llorente, Foyth, Aurier, Moura, Davies Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9 Subs: Mignolet, Kelleher, Lovren, Milner, Gomez, Sturridge, Moreno, Lallana, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Shaqiri, Brewster, Origi Referee: D Skomina (Slovenia) Liverpool have posted their starting lineup on their official twitter thing. Looks like Wijnaldum\u2019s heroics off the bench agaisnt Bar\u00e7a have got him back into the XI. Good. Liverpool: Alisson; Alexander-Arnold, Van Dijk, Matip, Robertson; Henderson, Fabinho, Wijnaldum; Salah, Firmino, Man\u00e9 \u201cImagine boarding a plane for a three-hour flight to London RIGHT NOW,\u201d sniffs Sam. \u201cI don\u2019t even support either team but the frustration is immense. My Gooner wife seems to be quite content to have her head in the clouds for a bit though.\u201d Spurs players are out having a stroll around the pitch, trying to familiarise themselves with the surrounds. But there are only a couple of thousand fans in their at the moment - no doubt the other 60,000 still have their snouts in plastic pint glasses. This place is going to feel very different come kickoff. \u201cI figure this is appropriate given both side\u2019s rocky road to the final, and in tribute to one of the most spine-tingling voices to jump out of a set of stereo speakers,\u201d croons Grant Tennille. \u201cAs a Gooner I can assure you I\u2019ll be listening to their cover of \u2018Baby Blue\u2019 should things go pear-shaped for Liverpool. It\u2019s on!\u201d Here come Liverpool in their bright red bus. As if to demonstrate that European finals are run of the mill to them, they\u2019re all wearing tracksuit and trainers, including Klopp. No shirts and ties for them. They\u2019re full of smiles and japes as they make their way to the dressing room, too. If your thinking is guided by body language, then expect Liverpool to make the more vibrant start. The Spurs\u2019 bus has arrived at the stadium. Pochettino and his players disembark and stride stone-faced towards the dressing room in smart black suits, shirts and ties. Guess Poch picked the outfits. Talking of penalty shootout, that\u2019s something we certainly have to factor into our pre-match thoughts: because English teams don\u2019t do emphatic victories in European Cup finals. Manchester United and Liverpool got things off to a misleading start with a 4-1 victory (1968) and 3-1 victory (1977) respectively. None of the English victories since then have been by more than one goal, and the last three have been through shootouts. Team selection pickle: Pochettino has a big call to make in his starting lineup: does he or doesn\u2019t he start Kane? There are rumours that he has plumped for the England striker and decided to drop Lucas Moura to the bench. For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019d have gone the other way on the basis that Moura\u2019s speed and mobility are more likely to trouble Liverpool\u2019s defence than Kane and also, if Kane starts he is unlikely to finish, given he has not played at all since suffering injury in the first leg of the quarter-final against Man City on April 9. So he probably won\u2019t be taking a penalty if it goes that far. A quick reminder that the Video Assistant Referee will be in use today. At least that is the plan and let\u2019s hope things don\u2019t go awry like they did in yesterday\u2019s African Champions League final second leg. VAR was supposed to be used in that, too, and would have been of tremendous benefit to Wydad Casablanca after their equaliser against Esp\u00e9rance was chalked off for an incorrect offside. But despite intense lobbying by Wydad staff and players, the referee refused to consult Var \u2013 apparently because he couldn\u2019t: the company that provides the technology claimed they told organisers before the game that airlines had lost some of their equipment in transit so Var would not be operational for the match, a detail that the organisers allegedly did not disclose to the teams beforehand. \bSo after the non-goal, play was stopped as players and officials argued on the pitch and sidelines for an hour and a half before Wydad announced they had no faith in the organisers and would not play. So Esp\u00e9rance won on a walkover. Let\u2019s have none of that carry-on today please! Fans are starting to filter into the stadium. Here are some shots of them enjoying themselves around Madrid: Here\u2019s Danny Taylor on what victory for either team might mean: We\u2019ve been catching up with Spurs and Liverpool fans ahead of the big day: Let\u2019s begin with the latest news and video from Friday\u2019s press conferences: Hello and welcome to coverage of the 64th European Cup/Champions League final, the ninth featuring Liverpool and the very first one with Tottenham Hotspur. Not many people expected Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team to make it this far but now that they are here, thanks to two of the most dramatic victories in the tournament\u2019s history \u2013 first over Manchester City and then over Ajax \u2013 they intend to make off with the big prize. Just imagine! Tottenham: European champions despite not being English champions since 1961, back when Elvis\u2019s Wooden Heart was top of the hit parade! For now, though, that is still just a wild dream for Spurs, and Liverpool intend to make sure it stays that way. They have been authors of some spectacular dramas themselves this season \u2013 just ask Lionel Messi \u2013 and they want this trophy badly. They came agonisingly close to lifting it last season, just as they came agonisingly close to lifting the Premier League this season, and they will be distraught if they do not leave Madrid today as kings of Europe for a sixth time. But not for one second will J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men be anticipating a straightforward win. It matters not a jot that Liverpool have already beaten Spurs twice this season en route to finishing 28 points above them on the domestic front. Sure, Liverpool know they can hurt Spurs but they and we are also well aware that Spurs have the tools to trouble them. This battle promises to be a belter. There are many, many ways it could be decided and many wonderful players who will play roles in tilting it one way or the other. In a few hours the old big-eared trophy will be heading to an English city beginning with L but for now we can\u2019t say more than that other than (1) don\u2019t get your hopes up, Lincoln, and (2) Bring It On! Kick-off is at 8pm, BST.",

      "bodyText": "Celestin Ngoga knows what happens when Rwanda\u2019s traumatic history comes hurtling into the present. He\u2019s been on European streets with genocide survivors when they encountered their attackers by chance. It can happen in English classes, he says, or on the train, or in shopping centres. \u201cFrom my experience, I have seen people in Europe just collapsing,\u201d Ngoga said. \u201cYou ask \u2018what happened?\u2019. They say \u2018that\u2019s the person who killed my mum. That\u2019s the person who cut me in my face with machete, sorry\u2019.\u201d That\u2019s why Ngoga was shocked when he learned, through the media, that Australia had resettled two former members of the Army for the Liberation of Rwanda \u2013 an offshoot of the forces responsible for the country\u2019s brutal 1994 genocide. Ngoga represents the Rwandan Diaspora of Australia, the main Rwandan-Australian community group. He sees it as his duty to protect the many survivors living in Australia from further trauma. At no point did the Australian government tell his group about resettlement of the two men, either before or after the story broke in US media outlet Politico. \u201cWe have a duty of actually just protecting these survivors of genocide, they are young,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones who can identify those who were trying to kill them, because most of them have got scars, physical scars, we don\u2019t want them to experience an additional trauma.\u201d Ngoga asks simply of the Australian government: \u201cDo they care? Do they actually care?\u201d The two Rwandan men came to Australia last year, after languishing in US detention for more than a decade. They posed a headache for the US government. It had extradited them in 2003 to face trial for the slaughter of western tourists in 1999, in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest, just near the Rwandan-Ugandan border. But the case against them collapsed. The questionable confessions they had made fell apart under scrutiny, shifting and changing with time, and plagued by inconsistencies. The pair, doctors later confirmed, had been tortured by Rwandan forces. Their injuries suggested shackling and beatings. A US district court found that they were \u201csubjected to periods of solitary confinement, positional torture, and repeated physical abuse\u201d. Australia agreed to take the men from the US in a secret asylum deal, which the prime minister, Scott Morrison, appeared to try to place at the feet of his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull. Turnbull had earlier told Donald Trump he was willing to \u201ctake anyone that you want us to take\u201d, while trying to convince him to uphold a deal to take asylum seekers from Australia. Ngoga wasn\u2019t the only one to be left in the dark. Family members of victims and survivors were also not told that the two men were in Australia. Morrison\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment. But he has previously said asylum cases required sensitivity and privacy. \u201cThese are very sensitive matters, when you\u2019re dealing with any refugee cases,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the privacy of those arrangements is always important. Whether you\u2019re dealing with Sri Lankan refugees, whether you\u2019re dealing with Iraqi refugees, Syrian refugees, indeed, or those out of the Sudan.\u201d The treatment of the pair has prompted accusations of double standards in the application of migration law. The law allows Australia to refuse or cancel visas on character grounds, including if an individual has had a past association with a criminal group. Ngoga said he knows of many refugees who were denied entry into Australia following the 1994 genocide. He said he didn\u2019t understand what process the government used to clear someone to come into the country. \u201cThese are things we don\u2019t really understand and we don\u2019t control,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody is asking us, until now. We ask ourselves why now they didn\u2019t inform us?\u201d",

      "body": "<p>It was already a fairly lively Tuesday morning when the former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell agreed to an interview with the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>The party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/may/26/european-election-latest-results-2019-uk-england-scotland-wales-ni-eu-parliament\" title=\"\">disastrous performance </a>in the European elections had reopened a painful debate about a second referendum on any Brexit deal, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission had said it was launching an investigation into claims of antisemitism within Labour.</p> <p>But Campbell wanted to talk about his new podcast. His daughter Grace had been pushing him to work on a series together and the two were keen to promote their new project \u2013 a chatty knockabout entitled<em> Football, Feminism And Everything In Between</em> featuring the likes of Ed Miliband and Rachel Riley as guests.</p> <p>Except that, two hours before we were due to meet, Campbell was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/31/alastair-campbell-labour-expulsion-discrimination-appeal\" title=\"\">thrown out of the Labour party </a>for having voted Liberal Democrat in the European elections. He voiced his bewilderment on Twitter and prompted a scramble on newsdesks across the country. One of the most controversial figures in recent British politics was suddenly back on the front pages.</p> <p>At home in north London, father and daughter fuss over making tea. We sit in a triangle at the kitchen table, Campbell on the left, Grace to the right. Rows blaze online and camera crews take their position outside on the doorstep. Campbell\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t stop buzzing. Every now and then, he scans incoming messages or breaks off to take a call in another room.</p> <p>\u201cYou know in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/25/thick-of-it-bbc-political-satire-ends\" title=\"\"><em>The Thick Of It</em> </a>when Malcolm Tucker leaves [government] and he\u2019s just hunched over working in his kitchen which, by the way, looks freakishly like this one?\u201d Grace waves her hand across the room for emphasis. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell scoffs. Tucker, an aggressive media manipulator, was a creation always assumed to be based on Campbell in his years working in government for Tony Blair. These days he says he prefers silence to listening to the <em>Today </em>programme, and despite being acutely attuned to everything on the political agenda that morning \u2013 the polls, the tweets, the breaking developments \u2013 he insists: \u201cI don\u2019t even read the papers any more. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>At 62, and with 40 years of Labour membership behind him, Campbell seems weary, rather than furious. \u201cThe breach of the rule is in supporting another party and I am very clear I do not support the Liberal Democrats,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Lib Dem because I support Labour. I\u2019m not a Liberal Democrat. I never will be. I did it because I want the Labour party to do the right thing and this is the only way I can bring that back. I could have \u2013 and this would have merited expulsion \u2013 I could have made hay with it, but I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d</p> <p>To the Labour leadership, it seemed he already had. Last Thursday, Corbyn said the matter was \u201ca question of what Mr Campbell said two days before the election, in which he apparently appeared to be supporting the Liberal Democrats. That is clearly not acceptable\u201d.</p> <p>It remains unclear what Corbyn was referring to. On the record, Campbell disclosed his vote only after the polls had closed, when he was directly asked on air by the LBC broadcaster Iain Dale. But, whatever the trigger, the result came last Tuesday in the form of an email \u201cwith regards from the legal and governance unit\u201d from party HQ.</p> <p>\u201cIf you start expelling everyone who voted Lib Dem in these elections,\u201d Campbell blows a raspberry, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a lot left.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c67812f16fd01f0797179f8fa85b98d351f26b3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c67812f16fd01f0797179f8fa85b98d351f26b3e/0_0_1714_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alastair Campbell with former prime minister Tony Blair days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Campbell with former prime minister Tony Blair days before the 2003 invasion of Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By last Wednesday a movement supporting Campbell had sprung up online under the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/expelmetoo?src=hash\" title=\"\">#expelmetoo</a>, with party members publicly declaring they had not voted Labour in the European elections. Cherie Blair and former Labour cabinet ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth were among them.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had messages today from people I\u2019ve never had messages from before,\u201d says Campbell, with a shrug. \u201cPeople I don\u2019t expect it from, people that are much closer to [Corbyn] and his sort of politics, but who say one of two things: either, this is really stupid and it will backfire, or secondly, this is no way to treat somebody who has dedicated most of his life to the party.\u201d</p> <p>Grace, 25, born just a month before her father joined Blair\u2019s team, is more forthright. Unsurprisingly, perhaps: their podcast was inspired by a <a href=\"https://www.lbc.co.uk/radio/alastair-campbell-daughter-feminism-advice/\" title=\"\">frank radio exchange last year</a> when she ambushed her father live on air over, among other things, his use of the word \u201cbirds\u201d to refer to women. Today, though, she is resolutely loyal. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off about it [the expulsion] and I\u2019ve lost a lot of faith in the Labour party. I am sure [Corbyn is] loving it.\u201d She leans in and rests her cheek in her hand. \u201cIt just feels very personal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure he will be, you know,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAnd you love Seb [Corbyn, Jeremy\u2019s son].\u201d Still, Grace is upset that many newer members of the party will be gleeful at the news. \u201cMomentum\u2019s tweet was unbelievable,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them hate Dad.\u201d Earlier that morning, the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement had tweeted: \u201cAlastair Campbell\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier started the Iraq war and left a million dead. Being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell brushes it off, casually dropping in the fact that Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, can\u2019t hate him all that much. She delivered a handwritten note asking him for support.</p> <p>To Campbell, it is clear the Labour party is being destroyed and that there are cracks among Corbyn\u2019s senior team. \u201cI\u2019ve had three people in his office today send me messages saying, \u2018What the fuck? I had no idea this was going to happen\u2019\u201d. Campbell\u2019s partner, education campaigner Fiona Millar, left the party months ago after Keir Starmer, sitting at the same kitchen table, promised her the claims of antisemitism within the party would be dealt with within six months. The glacial pace at which the party has moved to deal with the issue compared with the speed at which Campbell was dismissed is an irony not lost on him, but he is unconvinced that there is any coherent strategy behind it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s so arrogant to think it\u2019s even about Corbyn \u2013 as if he\u2019s this little baby that everyone has to protect</p> <footer> <cite>Grace Campbell</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey make it up as they go along. They don\u2019t have a strategy, they have a fantasy. Seumas Milne [Corbyn\u2019s adviser] is an old-fashioned posh-boy Stalinist. He\u2019s not really Labour \u2013 he never has been. The idea that he stands up for or represents working class people in the north does my head in. They haven\u2019t got a clue about people like that. They\u2019re not motivated by people like that. So far as they have a strategy, it\u2019s basically to get the Tories to implode, make Brexit happen and try not to get the blame.\u201d</p> <p>Campbell has campaigned vociferously for a people\u2019s vote. Did he ever consider that his endorsement might have been damaging? \u201cI don\u2019t think so.

Does Nigel Farage worry about the fact he\u2019s hated by a lot of people? No, he just campaigns.\u201d</p> <p>The EU election results can fairly be taken as a proxy vote on Brexit; nonetheless, Campbell ardently believes a people\u2019s vote could deliver a win for Remainers. \u201cListen, more people signed that revoke petition than voted for the Brexit party \u2026 I honestly believe that if we had another referendum where the choice was to remain in a reformed EU, against a credible, deliverable form of hard Brexit \u2013 which is all you\u2019re going to get now \u2013 then I think we\u2019ll win, and we will win well.

      "bodyText": "It was already a fairly lively Tuesday morning when the former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell agreed to an interview with the Observer. The party\u2019s disastrous performance in the European elections had reopened a painful debate about a second referendum on any Brexit deal, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission had said it was launching an investigation into claims of antisemitism within Labour. But Campbell wanted to talk about his new podcast. His daughter Grace had been pushing him to work on a series together and the two were keen to promote their new project \u2013 a chatty knockabout entitled Football, Feminism And Everything In Between featuring the likes of Ed Miliband and Rachel Riley as guests. Except that, two hours before we were due to meet, Campbell was thrown out of the Labour party for having voted Liberal Democrat in the European elections. He voiced his bewilderment on Twitter and prompted a scramble on newsdesks across the country. One of the most controversial figures in recent British politics was suddenly back on the front pages. At home in north London, father and daughter fuss over making tea. We sit in a triangle at the kitchen table, Campbell on the left, Grace to the right. Rows blaze online and camera crews take their position outside on the doorstep. Campbell\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t stop buzzing. Every now and then, he scans incoming messages or breaks off to take a call in another room. \u201cYou know in The Thick Of It when Malcolm Tucker leaves [government] and he\u2019s just hunched over working in his kitchen which, by the way, looks freakishly like this one?\u201d Grace waves her hand across the room for emphasis. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d Campbell scoffs. Tucker, an aggressive media manipulator, was a creation always assumed to be based on Campbell in his years working in government for Tony Blair. These days he says he prefers silence to listening to the Today programme, and despite being acutely attuned to everything on the political agenda that morning \u2013 the polls, the tweets, the breaking developments \u2013 he insists: \u201cI don\u2019t even read the papers any more. I don\u2019t.\u201d At 62, and with 40 years of Labour membership behind him, Campbell seems weary, rather than furious. \u201cThe breach of the rule is in supporting another party and I am very clear I do not support the Liberal Democrats,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Lib Dem because I support Labour. I\u2019m not a Liberal Democrat. I never will be. I did it because I want the Labour party to do the right thing and this is the only way I can bring that back. I could have \u2013 and this would have merited expulsion \u2013 I could have made hay with it, but I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d To the Labour leadership, it seemed he already had. Last Thursday, Corbyn said the matter was \u201ca question of what Mr Campbell said two days before the election, in which he apparently appeared to be supporting the Liberal Democrats. That is clearly not acceptable\u201d. It remains unclear what Corbyn was referring to. On the record, Campbell disclosed his vote only after the polls had closed, when he was directly asked on air by the LBC broadcaster Iain Dale. But, whatever the trigger, the result came last Tuesday in the form of an email \u201cwith regards from the legal and governance unit\u201d from party HQ. \u201cIf you start expelling everyone who voted Lib Dem in these elections,\u201d Campbell blows a raspberry, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a lot left.\u201d By last Wednesday a movement supporting Campbell had sprung up online under the hashtag #expelmetoo, with party members publicly declaring they had not voted Labour in the European elections. Cherie Blair and former Labour cabinet ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth were among them. \u201cI\u2019ve had messages today from people I\u2019ve never had messages from before,\u201d says Campbell, with a shrug. \u201cPeople I don\u2019t expect it from, people that are much closer to [Corbyn] and his sort of politics, but who say one of two things: either, this is really stupid and it will backfire, or secondly, this is no way to treat somebody who has dedicated most of his life to the party.\u201d Grace, 25, born just a month before her father joined Blair\u2019s team, is more forthright. Unsurprisingly, perhaps: their podcast was inspired by a frank radio exchange last year when she ambushed her father live on air over, among other things, his use of the word \u201cbirds\u201d to refer to women. Today, though, she is resolutely loyal. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off about it [the expulsion] and I\u2019ve lost a lot of faith in the Labour party. I am sure [Corbyn is] loving it.\u201d She leans in and rests her cheek in her hand. \u201cIt just feels very personal.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure he will be, you know,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAnd you love Seb [Corbyn, Jeremy\u2019s son].\u201d Still, Grace is upset that many newer members of the party will be gleeful at the news. \u201cMomentum\u2019s tweet was unbelievable,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them hate Dad.\u201d Earlier that morning, the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement had tweeted: \u201cAlastair Campbell\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier started the Iraq war and left a million dead. Being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves.\u201d Campbell brushes it off, casually dropping in the fact that Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, can\u2019t hate him all that much. She delivered a handwritten note asking him for support. To Campbell, it is clear the Labour party is being destroyed and that there are cracks among Corbyn\u2019s senior team. \u201cI\u2019ve had three people in his office today send me messages saying, \u2018What the fuck? I had no idea this was going to happen\u2019\u201d. Campbell\u2019s partner, education campaigner Fiona Millar, left the party months ago after Keir Starmer, sitting at the same kitchen table, promised her the claims of antisemitism within the party would be dealt with within six months. The glacial pace at which the party has moved to deal with the issue compared with the speed at which Campbell was dismissed is an irony not lost on him, but he is unconvinced that there is any coherent strategy behind it. \u201cThey make it up as they go along. They don\u2019t have a strategy, they have a fantasy. Seumas Milne [Corbyn\u2019s adviser] is an old-fashioned posh-boy Stalinist. He\u2019s not really Labour \u2013 he never has been. The idea that he stands up for or represents working class people in the north does my head in. They haven\u2019t got a clue about people like that. They\u2019re not motivated by people like that. So far as they have a strategy, it\u2019s basically to get the Tories to implode, make Brexit happen and try not to get the blame.\u201d Campbell has campaigned vociferously for a people\u2019s vote. Did he ever consider that his endorsement might have been damaging? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s so simple for them to say \u2018Oh Tony Blair, urrghh Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson, Andrew Adonis\u2019 but who else is moving the debate? We\u2019ve been out there the whole time. Does Nigel Farage worry about the fact he\u2019s hated by a lot of people? No, he just campaigns.\u201d The EU election results can fairly be taken as a proxy vote on Brexit; nonetheless, Campbell ardently believes a people\u2019s vote could deliver a win for Remainers. \u201cListen, more people signed that revoke petition than voted for the Brexit party \u2026 I honestly believe that if we had another referendum where the choice was to remain in a reformed EU, against a credible, deliverable form of hard Brexit \u2013 which is all you\u2019re going to get now \u2013 then I think we\u2019ll win, and we will win well.

Campbell doesn\u2019t confirm that he would \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t, either. Does he feel less Labour today? \u201cNo, I feel more Labour because of the responses I\u2019ve had.\u201d What does it mean to him, feeling Labour?

Not with our voting system and electorates.</p> <p>What if you had joined a party of government, worked slowly but surely to get numbers in various branches \u2013 such as Melbourne or Sydney, an ACT seat or two \u2013 taken control of the process for Senate selection in a state or territory so you got your candidate at the top of the ticket?</p> <p>Can you honestly say you would have achieved less?</p> <p>The IPA and its slithering brine of libertarians have effectively taken over parts of the Liberal party in this manner \u2013 to the point where James Paterson of all people was number 1 on the Liberal party\u2019s Senate ticket in Victoria.</p> <p>Was it also impossible for you to join a union and indulge in some politics? (And yes, I know the unions and their control over pre-selections is awful).</p> <p>Heck, the activism would not have needed to stop, but you would have been inside the tent \u2013 imagine a left wing of the ALP that actually was leftwing?</p> <p>Yes, the process would have been slow and frustrating, but ask yourself: just how much of a real influence have you had on climate change policy? How much success have you had?</p> <p>Is it really a success that after 27 years of the Greens the LNP cares so little about climate change that Scott Morrison can appoint Angus Taylor as minister for reducing emissions?</p> <p>If that is success, what does failure look like?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/30/matt-canavan-should-stop-wagging-his-finger-at-those-who-want-climate-action\">Matt Canavan should stop wagging his finger at those who want climate action | Katharine Murphy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sure, you might have had to compromise on some of your principles (say, on asylum seekers, but has even that been a success?) but are you a vanity project or do actually want to achieve change? Might it not be nice to be a party of government?</p> <p>Which bring us to the question for the ALP:</p> <p>In the past quarter of a century there have been nine elections and your party won a majority of seats in one of them.</p> <p>One out of nine.

I mean, really?

Should you not have reached out to them and worked with them instead of hoping that going it alone would achieve victory?</p> <p>What about some sort of coalition with this Greens mob? Not as joined at the hip but something formal, something that when in government had some Greens senators or MPs given some responsibility?</p> <p>Maybe you should have looked at other aspects of the ALP, such as allowing MPs to cross the floor \u2013 I\u2019m sure a few progressive MPs would have liked to be able to do that on data retention and encryption bills.

Is this the way to win?</p> <p>You could have stopped contesting some seats (come on, Bandt is not going to lose) and acknowledge you need the Greens preferences. Maybe instead of hating on them, you should have worked openly with them.</p> <p>No, it won\u2019t be like the LNP \u2013 the Nats compete in seats Liberal MPs only see when visiting their hobby farm or while driving through on the way to the snowfields \u2013 the Greens and ALP fight over the same territory, so it is a lot trickier.</p> <p>But how about joining them in the culture wars fight, because seriously, the ALP in the past decade is the most gutless party in Australian history.

      "bodyText": "I have a question each for Greens and ALP members. First, the Greens: back in 1992, when the Australian Greens was formed, is this what you wanted to achieve: emissions excluding land use are roughly 6% above 2005 levels and rising, our Paris target is a joke even before you consider it is based on dodgy accounting, the first mammal to become extinct due to climate change occurred in Australia, and the likelihood of Australia achieving zero net emissions by 2050 is virtually nil? Would that in any way have been considered a success back in 1992? Sure, you have some Senate seats. Lovely. But that\u2019s not really how we measure success when the planet is warming, is it? So here\u2019s the question \u2013 can you honestly say you have done more to combat climate change and reduce emissions by forming your own party than if you had instead channelled your forces into the ALP \u00e0 la the \u201cprogressive caucus\u201d in the Democratic party (which was founded in 1991 and whose first chair was Bernie Sanders)? At this point I see you roll your eyes: \u201cOh yes, change from within \u2013 we\u2019ve seen how that works!\u201d Except we\u2019ve seen how it works when you are outside the ALP. What if you had been inside? Yes, you look with hope at the \u201cGreen wave\u201d in Europe, but be honest, that is not going to happen here. Not with our voting system and electorates. What if you had joined a party of government, worked slowly but surely to get numbers in various branches \u2013 such as Melbourne or Sydney, an ACT seat or two \u2013 taken control of the process for Senate selection in a state or territory so you got your candidate at the top of the ticket? Can you honestly say you would have achieved less? The IPA and its slithering brine of libertarians have effectively taken over parts of the Liberal party in this manner \u2013 to the point where James Paterson of all people was number 1 on the Liberal party\u2019s Senate ticket in Victoria. Was it also impossible for you to join a union and indulge in some politics? (And yes, I know the unions and their control over pre-selections is awful). Heck, the activism would not have needed to stop, but you would have been inside the tent \u2013 imagine a left wing of the ALP that actually was leftwing? Yes, the process would have been slow and frustrating, but ask yourself: just how much of a real influence have you had on climate change policy? How much success have you had? Is it really a success that after 27 years of the Greens the LNP cares so little about climate change that Scott Morrison can appoint Angus Taylor as minister for reducing emissions? If that is success, what does failure look like? Sure, you might have had to compromise on some of your principles (say, on asylum seekers, but has even that been a success?) but are you a vanity project or do actually want to achieve change? Might it not be nice to be a party of government? Which bring us to the question for the ALP: In the past quarter of a century there have been nine elections and your party won a majority of seats in one of them. One out of nine. ONE! Is that success? At this point, are you really even a party of government? Let\u2019s be honest, you suck at winning elections. What if somewhere in that period you realised these Greens folk are not going away, they actually seem to engage young people quite well and have some policies that not only seem quite exciting but are also the right thing to do? Do you believe in climate change? I mean, really? Because if so, why do you hedge? You are like a doctor who says smoking kills and then tells the patient maybe to cut down to half a pack a day. No wonder people feel it is easy to believe the whole climate change thing is fake. If it was real, surely you would be a lot more urgent. Why not have a policy that treats the climate crisis like it is a crisis? What if at some point in the past 25 years you had been big, bold, brash \u2026 like the Greens are on the issue? Should you not have reached out to them and worked with them instead of hoping that going it alone would achieve victory? What about some sort of coalition with this Greens mob? Not as joined at the hip but something formal, something that when in government had some Greens senators or MPs given some responsibility? Maybe you should have looked at other aspects of the ALP, such as allowing MPs to cross the floor \u2013 I\u2019m sure a few progressive MPs would have liked to be able to do that on data retention and encryption bills. It might have encouraged people to join knowing they can actually use their voice. And let\u2019s talk about factions. You know who likes factions? Nobody. Sure those factional rules might have served you well in the 1950s and 1960s when you enjoyed 23 straight years in opposition, but is there any evidence they are actually good? And look at some of your MPs in safe seats \u2013 no one knows who they are and they are mostly there due to union-backed support and/or time spent as an advisor. Is this the way to win? You could have stopped contesting some seats (come on, Bandt is not going to lose) and acknowledge you need the Greens preferences. Maybe instead of hating on them, you should have worked openly with them. No, it won\u2019t be like the LNP \u2013 the Nats compete in seats Liberal MPs only see when visiting their hobby farm or while driving through on the way to the snowfields \u2013 the Greens and ALP fight over the same territory, so it is a lot trickier. But how about joining them in the culture wars fight, because seriously, the ALP in the past decade is the most gutless party in Australian history. Mention national security and the ALP folds (passing laws even when you have serious questions about them!). I mean, you are happy to honour Operation Sovereign Borders in the Australian War Museum. What the hell? Do you want to be a progressive party or a party pretending to be progressive? Now sure, it would have annoyed many older members and we might have had to cope with people like Martin Ferguson quitting the party. And well \u2026 would that really have been a shame? You might have to admit to some policy that actually has morals attached to it (say, asylum seekers) \u2013 but wouldn\u2019t it be nice to do good policy and actually sell it well? You might have to give up a ministry or two, but so what \u2013 you rarely get the chance to be a minister as it is. Let\u2019s be honest: by 2022 you will have been in opposition for 20 out of 26 years. That is failure. Now of course, none of this is going to happen. The Greens will never think they did wrong (and I am not sure they have), and the ALP will never agree to any sort of coalition with the Greens. They both hate each other, and their differences are pretty deep. But here\u2019s the thing: what from the past 25 years gives anyone any belief that the next 25 years are going to be better? I actually don\u2019t give a stuff about the Greens winning Senate seats, or arguments from the ALP about how they have to win more than 10% than the Greens do. I care about whether we reduce our emissions. When it comes to climate crisis, that\u2019s the only scoreboard that matters. Right now, the scoreboard is not a good sight for anyone who hopes to see real action on climate change, and both parties should ask themselves what they are doing to change that. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

The constituency has historically been a close-run battle between Labour and the Conservatives, but Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit party is attempting to gain a foothold in Westminster and is the bookmakers\u2019 favourite. In the latest Opinium/Observer poll published on Sunday, the Brexit party has surged into first place, overtaking Labour. It is the first time the party has achieved top position in a national poll. The Brexit party is on 26% with Labour on 22%, the Tories on 17%, and the Lib Dems on 16%. When Labour supporters were asked what they wanted their party\u2019s policy on Europe to be, 65% said they either wanted a second referendum or to Remain, with only 17% wanting either a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit. Adam Drummond, of Opinium, said: \u201cAll of the big winners from the European elections have seen some sort of a boost, with the Brexit party adding another two points to move into first place while Labour have fallen back significantly, losing seven points. While the Lib Dems have experienced a boost, the under-reported story from the elections and since then has been the Greens, who have gained eight points since our last poll. \u201cWhile the Brexit party and the Lib Dems have been taking votes from Leavers and Remainers respectively, the Greens are unique in taking votes from both sides of the Brexit divide. \u201cWhile the usual caveats should apply about how much to read into Westminster voting intention polls given the proximity to the European elections, the fact is that we might be less than six months out from a general election, so these might become relevant very quickly.\u201d",

One person did not require urgent care, he said, \u201cbut if the injury were a little further over he probably wouldn\u2019t be here today\u201d.</p> \n<p>One policeman was hurt, saved by a bulletproof vest.

According to the Associated Press, Craddock spent time in the national guard and received military training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He graduated from Old Dominion University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering.</p> \n<p>Police confirmed on Saturday that he was a current employee and had not been recently terminated, as had been reported by some news outlets. The gunman gained access to the building with an active security pass.</p> \n<p>Authorities said the gunman used a .45 caliber handgun with a suppressor and \u201cextended\u201d magazines. On Saturday, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Ashan Benedict told reporters the gunman carried two pistols which were purchased legally in 2016 and 2018. An unidentified firearm recovered from the gunman\u2019s home was also purchased legally.</p> \n<p>Megan Banton, an administrative assistant, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. She texted her mother to say there was a gunman in the building.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,\u201d Banton told the AP. \u201cWe were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn\u2019t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.\u201d</p> \n<p>Virginia Beach is the biggest city in its eponymous state.

      "bodyText": "America was reeling on Saturday after 12 people were shot dead at a government building in Virginia Beach late on Friday afternoon. It was the deadliest mass shooting this year and prompted fresh demands for gun control reform. The 12 who died were named. Describing a \u201chorrific crime scene\u201d, police and city leaders said they would name the gunman only once, preferring to focus on those he killed. Four people remained in hospital, seriously injured. Virginia Beach\u2019s city manager, Dave Hansen, struggled to suppress sorrow and anger as he described \u201ca senseless, incomprehensible act of violence\u201d. As he listed the dead, his co-workers, he referred to them in the present tense. Eleven were city employees who worked in Municipal Building Two. One was a contractor trying to get a permit. All but three lived in Virginia Beach. Details began to emerge, in tributes from friends and family. Christopher Rapp was a member of a local bagpipe group. In a Facebook post, bandmates said he was quiet but passionate. He had only been working for the city for 11 months. Robert \u201cBobby\u201d Williams, a special projects coordinator, had worked for the city for 41 years. Laquita C Brown was remembered as someone who lit up any room. \u201cIt still doesn\u2019t feel real,\u201d Sinda Price wrote of the public works employee of nearly five years. \u201cI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone.\u201d Ryan Keith Cox\u2019s brother, Ervin Ray Cox Jr, wrote: \u201cMy heart is hurting because my baby brother was murdered today. I won\u2019t hear his beautiful singing voice at church or home anymore. I loved my brother and will truly miss his caring soul. Until we meet again in heaven.\u201d The other victims were Tara Walsh Gallagher, Mary Louis Gayle, Alexander Mikhail Gusev, Katherine A Nixon, Richard H Nettleton, Joshua O Hardy, Michelle \u201cMissy\u201d Langer, and Herbert \u201cBert\u201d Snelling. They left, Hansen said, \u201ca void we will never be able to fill\u201d. The injured were not named. Martin O\u2019Grady, head of trauma at Sentara Virginia Beach hospital, told reporters one person had returned to intensive care and two needed operations \u201cto get injuries repaired\u201d. One person did not require urgent care, he said, \u201cbut if the injury were a little further over he probably wouldn\u2019t be here today\u201d. One policeman was hurt, saved by a bulletproof vest. The police chief, James Cervera, said officers responded \u201cwithin minutes\u201d of the first call from Municipal Building Two. There was no verbal exchange with the gunman. \u201cOnce he identified them he immediately opened fire,\u201d Cervera said. \u201cThey returned fire. This was a long-term, large gunfight.\u201d The gunman was killed by police. The shooting stunned this resort city of 448,000 residents and 3 million annual tourists, and renewed national debate about gun violence. Joe Biden, the former vice-president running for the Democratic nomination, said he and his wife, Jill, were \u201cheartbroken\u201d. \u201cWhen will we finally say enough is enough?\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time to hold our leaders accountable.\u201d Cervera named the gunman as DeWayne Craddock, 40, a 15-year employee of the public works department. According to the Associated Press, Craddock spent time in the national guard and received military training at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He graduated from Old Dominion University with a bachelor\u2019s degree in civil engineering. Police confirmed on Saturday that he was a current employee and had not been recently terminated, as had been reported by some news outlets. The gunman gained access to the building with an active security pass. Authorities said the gunman used a .45 caliber handgun with a suppressor and \u201cextended\u201d magazines. On Saturday, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Ashan Benedict told reporters the gunman carried two pistols which were purchased legally in 2016 and 2018. An unidentified firearm recovered from the gunman\u2019s home was also purchased legally. Megan Banton, an administrative assistant, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded herself and about 20 colleagues inside an office, pushing a desk against a door. She texted her mother to say there was a gunman in the building. \u201cWe tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,\u201d Banton told the AP. \u201cWe were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn\u2019t real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.\u201d Virginia Beach is the biggest city in its eponymous state. Mayor Bobby Dyer called Friday \u201cthe most devastating day\u201d in the history of his city. It was the deadliest instance of US gun violence since November 2018, when a dozen people were killed at a bar and grill in Thousand Oaks, California. Other recent death tolls include 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016; 58 people at a concert in Las Vegas in October 2017; 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, in February 2018; and 11 people at a synagogue in Pittsburgh in October. On Saturday, Donald Trump tweeted that he had spoken to Virginia\u2019s governor, Ralph Northam, and city leaders \u201cto offer condolences to that great community. The federal government is there, and will be, for whatever they may need. God bless the families and all!\u201d The president is a close ally of the National Rifle Association, which is headquartered in Virginia. Democrats competing to take on Trump were quick to demand reform. Senator Bernie Sanders, for example, wrote on Twitter: \u201cThe days of the NRA controlling Congress and writing our gun laws must end. Congress must listen to the American people and pass gun safety legislation.\u201d In a statement, the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, pointed to a bill passed in February when she said the House had \u201cpassed commonsense, bipartisan gun violence prevention legislation\u201d. But the prospect of an end to business as usual still appears remote. \u201cThe Senate must bring these bills to a vote,\u201d Pelosi said. As the upper chamber is controlled by Republicans, that remains unlikely.",

Here at Bristol he managed to find, from deep down inside, the same sort of pace that he had back in 2008, when he was a superstar kid just out of tape-ball cricket. He is still wearing the headband and has the Afghan flags painted on his cheeks, but he is a little thicker around the middle now, and his hair has turned pepper grey.

Campbell got a lot of flak for being a powerful unelected adviser. But there is a big difference between him and Milne. Campbell never worked against the interests of the party or the leader or the shadow cabinet. He was a team player. Milne and the little clique around Corbyn have their own agenda, which is all about power in the party without regard to power in the country. Corbyn has rightly adopted the slogan \u201cThe many not the few\u201d, but steadfastly refuses to listen to the many and listens only to the few. Certainly not MPs, the vast majority of whom want a confirmatory people\u2019s vote with the option of staying in. Certainly not the members, who want the same and who want to see leadership on Brexit. There is not going to be an attempted coup against Corbyn so there has to be a very different approach to saving the party and the chance of defeating this shambles of a Conservative government. In my view there are two forces within the Labour movement \u2013 the unions and Momentum \u2013 who must now act to get rid of those key advisers who are a block on policy changes and who are responsible for the incompetence we are seeing. The major unions have historically played a key role in the stability of the Labour party, taking difficult and sometimes painful action when failure had to be dealt with. This is such a moment. The leadership of Momentum has always proclaimed that it was a popular social movement keen to reflect rank-and-file views. If they meant it, now is the time to prove it. But for the public, the spectacle of Alastair Campbell ejected from the party, the Equality and Human Rights Commission initiating a formal inquiry into the handling of antisemitism, and the failure to demonstrate clarity and competence in holding this government to account, matter more than anything else. That is the challenge we face.",

Seven years after the first programme, Granada TV suggested that Apted go back to interview the subjects again \u2013 and so the framework for one of the world\u2019s most influential documentary experiments was established.</p> <p>\u201cI have my passions,\u201d said Turner. \u201cI have my grandchildren, and I am also passionate about an old car I\u2019ve had for decades. This programme is up there with those passions.\u201d</p> <p>Apted, like Turner, has remained emotionally committed. The British director, who went on to make his name in Hollywood, directing films such as <em>Coal Miner\u2019s Daughter</em>, <em>Gorillas in the Mist</em> and the Bond thriller <em>The World is Not Enough</em>, has stayed at the centre of the Up series, returning every seventh year to chart the lives of participants who have now become familiar to television audiences. As children, some of the stars were precocious where others were shy; some were well-off and some disadvantaged. Apted deliberately intended to contrast the opportunities of children of different social classes.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about class in the beginning,\u201d said Turner, \u201cbut it was not done scientifically, in the way it would be now. It was quite random: simply going to schools in London and Liverpool and the Lake District.\u201d</p> <p>He believes that neither class nor their involvement in the <em>Up</em> series has materially altered the lives of the cast.</p> <p>\u201cThey have all had the lives they would have had, I think,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re only there every seven years. A lot of them did not classify themselves by social class as children, of course. Yes, we are an intrusion. But then when they are long gone, their grandchildren will be able to see what they were like.\u201d</p> <p>Turner has had great control over the way the participants were portrayed from the age of 28. \u201cUntil the <em>42 Up</em> series, it was all shot on film, so I was the only one who saw the footage. I had to compose it, and expose it. There was a huge act of trust that took place.\u201d</p> <p>For <em>63 Up</em>, Turner has chosen sequences from the archive not seen for 21 years. \u201cI make sure we don\u2019t always go back to the same stuff.\u201d</p> <p>The defining feature of the whole series has, he believes, been its relaxed mood.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever you film with the participants, you are given this one opportunity, but we always want to make sure there is no more stress for them than necessary. Even the way I light it is part of that. I don\u2019t draw the curtains or anything. We want to show their normal lives. They know I have their interests at heart. We want to keep it very conversational.\u201d</p> <p>That atmosphere of trust remains, he said, despite the banter between the 14 subjects and the ageing crew.</p> <p>\u201cThey are all good at talking now. I know from making other films that finding a way to get people to speak and make sense can be very hard. The familiarity with the team helps.\u201d</p> <p>But catching up in Australia with Symon and Paul, two orphan boys first filmed at Barnardo\u2019s, Turner was reminded that the participants can still surprise him.</p> <p>\u201cWe were walking through Melbourne Cricket Ground and they suddenly both lit up at this statue of a fast bowler. We didn\u2019t know they both knew so much about cricket. But I had to be there to film it, to get those bits of magic.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb1412459809babc8639aae592c5abc72623517c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb1412459809babc8639aae592c5abc72623517c/0_120_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michael Apted and George Jesse Turner on location in Greenwich Park filming for 56 Up, which was screened in 2012.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Apted and George Jesse Turner filming in London for 56 Up, which was screened in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Johnson/ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what of the other 12 participants?

      "bodyText": "When George Jesse Turner, a cameraman in his 20s, was invited to join the team making a unique series of documentaries following the lives of a group of schoolchildren, he grabbed the chance to work with a young director who was making a name for himself at Granada TV. But, by taking the job alongside Michael Apted 42 years ago, Turner was harnessing himself to a roller coaster that has played an exhilarating role in the rest of his life. This week, the series that started out in 1964 as Seven Up! comes back to our screens for a ninth instalment, and Turner, 74, who has filmed all but the first two series, is calling for a suitably grand finish to the groundbreaking run of documentaries. \u201cThe proper way to end it might be a fantastic party. But that could cost up to \u00a350,000. So it will be up to ITV,\u201d he said.

In excellent recent news, the House has passed the Equality Act, which would protect LGBTQ people from discrimination in their places of work, homes, schools, and other public accommodations. The next step is that the bill will go before the Senate. I\u2019ve decided to kick off Pride Month by writing a letter to one of my senators to explain how strongly I feel that the Equality Act should be passed. I urge you to write to your senators too. I\u2019ll be looking for your letters by searching the hashtag #lettertomysenator. While there\u2019s no information yet as to when the Equality Act will go before the Senate for a vote, we do know this: Politicians need votes to stay in office. Votes come from the people. Pressure from massive amounts of people is a major way to push politicians towards positive change. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve created a petition at change.org to urge the Senate to support the Equality Act. Our country\u2019s lack of protection for its own citizens ensures that LGBTQ people must live in fear that their lives could be turned upside down by an employer or landlord who is homophobic or transphobic. The fact that, legally, some people are completely at the mercy of the hatred and bigotry of others is disgusting and unacceptable. Let\u2019s show our pride by demanding that, on a national level, our laws truly treat all of our citizens equally. \ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08 Click the link in my bio to sign the petition for Senate support of the Equality Act.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;A post shared by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/taylorswift/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Taylor Swift&lt;/a&gt; (@taylorswift) on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2019-06-01T04:05:04+00:00&quot;&gt;May 31, 2019 at 9:05pm PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The Equality Act protections would extend to employment, housing, loan applications, education, public accommodations and other areas.

This appeared to be a reference to a tweet from Trump on Friday that asked Americans to \u201ccelebrate LGBTQ Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions that LGBTQ people have made to our great nation\u201d, and to \u201cstand in solidarity with the many LGBTQ people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish, imprison, or even execute individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation\u201d. The message was later released as an official statement from the White House. Trump received widespread criticism for the message\u2019s incompatibility with his administration\u2019s record on LGBTQ rights. Trump, whose vice-president, Mike Pence, is frequently criticised for his views on LGBTQ rights, has banned transgender people from the US military. Recently, the administration has expanded a so-called \u201cconscience\u201d rule allowing healthcare providers to turn away LGBTQ people on religious grounds, and ended protections in federally funded homeless shelters for transgender people.",

Dawlat Zadran with his lovely, classical bowling action is replacing him. Four years ago in this corresponding fixture he had the Australians in trouble for about four overs before they slapped 400-odd, Warner making a massive ton. He\u2019s overstepped to begin here though, giving the former vice-captain a free hit. Sure enough, clearing the front leg, he slaps it right back over his head for a boundary - his first this evening. The seamer improves as he goes on, giving away just one further single. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf2a4df8f082f7da1f2bff5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T16:18:52.535Z\">5.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>4th over: Australia 29-0 (Finch 24, Warner 5) Target 208 </strong>Hamid hits 89mph on the radar early in the over then 88mph later...

Quite remarkable when you consider how heavily the Victorian has scored at the top of the list over the last eight years or so. He\u2019s taken his nine and made it 20 by the end of this Mujeeb over, lauching him <strong>looooong</strong> into the stand at long-on. That\u2019s a lovely strike, at a ground that rewards straight hitting, so short are the boundaries. When Warner gets his turn, he strokes through the gap at cover for three.

That was quite a lot of fun towards the end, Afghanistan piling on 41 runs in 20 balls for their final two wickets. Rashid Khan, who was very much Blur over Oasis during the Britpop War, makes my heart swell. More to the point, the Afghanistan fans to my right at cow corner was giving it huge, well supported by neutral fans who would love to see them defend 207.</p> <p>The best bit was when they engineered a flag conga line of sorts during the second drinks break, sprinting from one length to the other, leaping over any hurdle in their way. That\u2019s the passion we\u2019re here for in this World Cup. They were also the first team to show some real fight, adding 130 after falling to 77/5 when it looked like everyone would be safely in the pub in time for the Champions League final.<br></p> <p>And look, maybe that still will be the case with Australian bound to attack this chase with Net Run Rate in mind, given that\u2019s exactly what West Indies and New Zealand have in their modest chases. We know that it will be Warner not Khawaja who partners with the captain Finch when they return in a few minutes from now - his first competitive international innings since you-know-what. Smith will do likewise at four (after Khawaja). <br></p> <p>There will be some booing, I\u2019m sure, but not much. Indeed, when Warner went to the boundary rope when Zampa was operating, there was a queue five deep for selfies and autographs. Likewise, when Smith nailed a crazy run out, there was genuine applause. My point: it\u2019s a pretty chilled out and happy afternoon here in Bristol. The perfect setting, let\u2019s hope, for a tricky little chase. <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf29b6a8f082f7da1f2bf99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sam-perry\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T15:48:57.796Z\">4.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Australia requires 208 to win</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>An innings of bursts. First, Starc and Cummins did the damage, before Rahmat and Shahidi were able to put on fifty and frustrate their defending champion counterparts. </p> <p>To start with Starc - if he\u2019s swinging it, Australia look like World Cup finalists. When not, less so. His third ball today was evidence enough that he\u2019s shaping the ball, but whether he can do it consistently - and/or find the conditions to assist - will go a long way to deciding his country\u2019s tournament fortunes.</p> <p>Following those early wickets, Rahmat looked particularly assured before he disappointingly pushed one to Smith. Two more wickets fell soon after, before the partnership of the innings - between Najibullah and Naib, entertained everyone. Najibullah was especially enterprising, showing a cavalcade of reverse sweeps to give Zampa a hard time, and they just about clawed Afghanistan back before a bouncer barrage brought the Australians back into it.</p> <p>\u201cAfghanistan played some pretty fearless cricket,\u201d said Adam Zampa just now, speaking to Michael Clarke. \u201cBut we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re chasing.\u201d<br></p> <p>One got the impression there\u2019s still plenty to work on for Australia in the field. There were wides, no-balls, and more than a few misfields. They\u2019re by no means over the line here, especially if Rashid and co can break through early.</p> <p>To take you through it all will be Adam Collins, who will join shortly.

      "bodyText": "Vic Marks\u2019 match report All told, they did it easy. 34.5 overs were enough to chase down Afghanistan\u2019s 207 to begin Australia\u2019s title defence. Finch was excellent early on, clearing the rope four times in his 66. The opening stand of 96 with Warner all-but settled things, even if Khawaja (15) and Smith (18) fell before the result was secured. Warner, named man of the match, was in no hurry. Indeed, it is one of his slowest ODI hands, facing 114 balls for his unbeaten 89. The boos were there all day but he didn\u2019t seem to mind, just ticking over and finishing what he started at the beginning of what will be a long summer of scruitny the former leadership duo. And that\u2019ll just about do us, I think. On behalf of Sam and myself, thanks for your company through the course of the day on the OBO. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning at The Oval when South Africa play Bangladesh. Enjoy the football! First ball in the middle, with three to win, Maxwell loads up and creams Mujeeb over cover for four. That\u2019s very Glenn Maxwell. Warner finishes unbeaten on 89. Oh dear. With three to win, Smith gets a thick edge to short third man. And he\u2019s FURIOUS at himself in the long walk off the ground as the crowd give it to him. 34th over: Australia 204-2 (Warner 88, Smith 18) Target 208 Rashid to Warner, who picks up a couple through the gap at midwicket. He gives the strike to Smith, turning it immediately back to the opener. Can he finish it this over? Nup - he\u2019s happy to take the single on offer at midwicket to retain the strike instead. 33rd over: Australia 199-2 (Warner 84, Smith 17) Target 208 Mujeeb didn\u2019t have a good day here in the warm-up game against Pakistan and hasn\u2019t had much going on here today either. Every ball of this over is scored off in 1s and 2s. 32nd over: Australia 191-2 (Warner 80, Smith 13) Target 208 Dawlat gives Smith one on his pads to begin, which he misses and gets angry at himself. As Geoff notes on TMS, that\u2019s the Smith we know so well. Warner adds a couple to move into the 80s but there is really not a lot else to see here, I\u2019m afraid. I\u2019m surprised they haven\u2019t charged to the finish line with NRR in mind, but maybe they have calculated that these two walking off with red ink is more important right now. 31st over: Australia 188-2 (Warner 79, Smith 11) Target 208 Warner takes a couple from Mujeeb to begin, which leaves him still technically within striking distance of a ton, but he gives the strike back to Smith with a single down the ground so that probably isn\u2019t on his mind. It definitely won\u2019t be now with Smith deflecting a boundary to third man. It\u2019s the first we have seen Mujeeb since the third over of the innings with his creative brand of spin. Okay fellas, time to finish this off. 30th over: Australia 180-2 (Warner 76, Smith 6) Target 208 Dawlat gets a second opportunity to show Bristol what a lovely bowling action he has. And a wicket should have come from the first ball of his spell, via a run out. Smith was gone by miles but Dawlat was nowhere near his stumps when the throw came in from backward square. The direct his wasn\u2019t on target but there was more than enough time for the bowler to do the job. Sigh. Sure enough, Warner responds later in the over by smacking him over his head for his eighth four. I didn\u2019t notice this before but they have on TMS: there are two people on the balcony at the other end of the ground dressed up as blocks of sandpaper. Fair play, that\u2019s commitment. 29th over: Australia 171-2 (Warner 67, Smith 6) Target 208 Australia have West Indies next at Trent Bridge on Thursday, with Afghanistan in Cardiff on Tuesday against Sri Lanka. Graeme Swann believes that Jason Holder\u2019s side should stick with their short-pitched approach. \u201cAustralia\u2019s egos will demand that they take them on.\u201d That could be fun. Five singles from Rashid\u2019s seventh over. 28th over: Australia 166-2 (Warner 64, Smith 4) Target 208 Hamid continues to charge in at Warner at pace, zippy enough to get through his defence prompting a massive shout for leg before. It\u2019s turned down and righty so having pitched outside leg, Rashid having blown their review in the previous over. It\u2019s a gorgeous evening in Bristol. This might technically be a day-night game but the floodlights, as Simon Mann notes on TMS, do not need to be on as they have been for the duration of this chase. The good news about the early finish is that everyone will be well into their pub of choice in time for the Champions League Final in in 65 minutes from now. Not in my case, I stress. We\u2019ll be working through it then heading back to London. Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll. 27th over: Australia 164-2 (Warner 62, Smith 3) Target 208 Rashid Khan is very keen on a leg before shout when Warner misses a reverse sweep, so keen that he sends it upstairs. Warner knows that it was off his glove, though, so he\u2019s straight back to his crease. A quick single from the ball that follows, Smith taking on short fine leg and running to what becomes the danger end but the throw isn\u2019t on target. \u201cIf everyone else is too lazy to do it, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d writes Peter Salmon. Bless you. This is his Queen Victorian XI. Joe Darling, W G Grace, Victor Trumper, Clem Hill, Syd Gregory (c), Monty Noble, Wilfred Rhodes, Harry Bullocky (wk), George Giffen, Fred Spofforth, Johnny Briggs. \u201cWilfred Rhodes debuted in 1899 so sneaks in. I\u2019ve made Harry Bullocky my wicketkeeper (Jack Blackham having got the gong for the Vic state team) - he kept wicket on the 1868 Aboriginal cricket tour of England.\u201d That\u2019s impressive work on a Saturday night. Thanks for your efforts. 26th over: Australia 160-2 (Warner 62, Smith 1) Target 208 The loudest boos of the day are reserved for Smith as he walks out to join Warner. He is greeted with a fist bump and a pat on the back from his former deputy as the western side of the ground get very loud in their chanting. Hamid Hassan is back to bowl at Warner initially, who takes one from the first ball. A wide down the legside is the first delivery that Smith has to deal with, the second pushed to cover to get him off the mark. The jeers continue each time he faces up. Feels a bit... forced? I don\u2019t know. Yep, that\u2019s very out. Rashid\u2019s straight one beats Khawaja on the inside edge. They consider sending it upstairs but don\u2019t bother in the end. That brings Smith to join Warner. This could be eventful. 25th over: Australia 156-2 (Warner 60) Target 208 24th over: Australia 150-1 (Warner 55, Khawaja 14) Target 208 Nabi skips through his over giving away just two singles to begin. Warner wants to be there at the end. 23rd over: Australia 148-1 (Warner 54, Khawaja 13) Target 208 Rashid Khan is back into the attack from our media centre end and he\u2019s immediately cut for four by Warner, taking him to a half-century at the first time of asking in this his return to Australian colours. It took 74 balls to reach the milestone but that won\u2019t bother him. There are boos but only really from the western side of the ground, one chap audible in calling him \u201ca knob head\u201d to the amusement of those around him. 22nd over: Australia 142-1 (Warner 49, Khawaja 12) Target 208 Nabi, now into his fifth overs, registers his second batch of five wides, Shahzad this time not as much at fault with the ball sprayed down the legside to Khawaja. From another delivery in this direction later in the over, the Queensland captain gets back early to pull and makes no mistake, splitting the gap at midwicket for his first four. 21st over: Australia 130-1 (Warner 48, Khawaja 6) Target 208 The wheels might be falling off for Afghanistan, unexpectedly while Gulbadin is at the bowling crease, who has been good until now. First, he gave Warner enough room to cut into the gap for four. You can\u2019t do that. Next, he overstepped. Then, with the free hit, he bowled a wide. To be fair, the re-bowled free hit was a good slower-ball bouncer, which Warner miscued, but it didn\u2019t matter that the catch was put down. 13 from the over. The remaining 77 runs that Australia need shouldn\u2019t take long to make. 20th over: Australia 117-1 (Warner 40, Khawaja 3) Target 208 Urrrgh, more poor fielding, this time from the keeper Shahzad. To be fair, Nabi\u2019s wide off-break to Khawaja turned from beyond the tram tracks but he should have got a glove to it. Instead, five wides go onto the Australian total. I get the feeling Australia might put the foot right down now with Net Run Rate front of mind. 19th over: Australia 109-1 (Warner 39, Khawaja 1) Target 208 Gulbadin isn\u2019t doing a lot wrong here. As Geoff Lemon notes on TMS, he has quite the body. At his press conference yesterday, I was captivated by his biceps. Geoff suggests a \u201crig off\u201d between the Afghanistan captain and Marcus Stoinis. I endorse this. Anyway, an otherwise good over is annoyingly sullied when Zazai misfields at fine leg, Warner the lucky beneficiary of the error. \u201cHow about an XI of Victorian Victorians? Spofforth and which ten others?\u201d Adrian Armstrong, I like the way you think. I fear though, that we\u2019ll run out of time. \u201cKeeping on the OBO from Caucasus mountains in Mestia, Georgia through pretty rubbish internet,\u201d emails Mark and Alyssa. Hello to you both! \u201cHow about Bert Ironmonger?\u201d they continue. \u201cA QUEENSLANDER who made his test debut as a Vic at aged 46. He took 74 test wickets as a left arm finger spinnner without an index finger, which he lost as a kid. That\u2019s a hard man. Just look at his pic.\u201d 18th over: Australia 103-1 (Warner 34, Khawaja 0) Target 208 Warner leans back in the crease and places Rashid delicately off the face of his bat to third man for four, bringing up Australia\u2019s 100. Shot. Khawaja is in no hurry when he gets his first opportinity of the World Cup, defending to cover a couple of times to finish. They take a drink. Given it is now that time of night, I suggest we all do. 17th over: Australia 98-1 (Warner 29, Khawaja 0) Target 208 Crossing in the air as Finch was dismissed, Warner is back on strike and happy to play the rest out with a straight bat before taking one to keep the strike behind square leg. I\u2019m not going to win this battle with the Victorian vs Victorian teams, am I? Peter Salmon is sliding into my inbox with his: Bill Lawry, Bill Ponsford, Dean Jones, Neil Harvey, Lindsay Hassett, Warwick Armstrong, Keith Miller, Hugh Trumble, Shane Warne, Jack Blackham, Merv Hughes. \u201cTrumble is interesting,\u201d he adds. \u201cMost wickets in Tests when her retired - 141 at 21.78. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, Monty Noble, as \u2018sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird.\u2019\u201d He\u2019s done plenty of damage but he Australian captain is gone, Finch miscuing the captain Gulbadin high in the air out to cover, taken well by Mujeeb. His 66 from 49 balls included four sixes and six fours. Neat. 16th over: Australia 94-0 (Finch 64, Warner 28) Target 208 Finch cuts a couple off Rashid to keep the good times rolling off the leggie to start his second over before giving Warner the strike. Oh, and there\u2019s his wrong\u2019un - a delivery that has netted him so many wickets. It beats Warner; they share a smile. But approach here is clear and working well: to handle the spinner by scoring off him at every opportunity, seven added to the total across this over, all through 1s and 2s. 15th over: Australia 87-0 (Finch 60, Warner 25) Target 208 To settle things down a touch after the busy previous over, Nabi races through a brisk over of darts, four singles added along the way. 14th over: Australia 83-0 (Finch 58, Warner 23) Target 208 Here we go: it\u2019s Rashid Khan. How will Australia approach the best legbreaker on the planet? Oh, Aaron Finch answers that question in the space of two balls, using the depth of the crease to cut him for four and bring up his half-century (in 40 balls), then going back again to cream a poor follow-up delivery for six over midwicket. With the sweepers found a few more times, it makes 14 from the over - the biggest of Australia\u2019s response. More to the point, they\u2019ve left an early dent in Rashid, top-ranked bowler in the world. And Finch is well on his way to a ton. 13th over: Australia 69-0 (Finch 47, Warner 20) Target 208 Afghanistan so close to the breakthrough they crave, Warner getting himself into a tangle after missing a cut off Nabi, the wicketkeepr Shazad taking the bails just after he dived into safe ground. The TV umpire confirmed that he was back, but not by far. A couple of further singles are exchanged to end the over, but that\u2019s their lot. 12th over: Australia 66-0 (Finch 45, Warner 19) Target 208 Gulbadin got through his first over for one run but Finch wasn\u2019t going to let that continue, picking up a ball from the line of the stumps and thumping it into the crowd at midwicket - his third six, taking him into the 40s. Abhijato Sensarma has emailed me before I specified that we were after players from the 1800s, and I can\u2019t argue with many of his nominations. Aaron Finch, Bill Lawry, Bill Woodfull (captain), Neil Harvey, Dean Jones, Brad Hodge, Keith Miller, Glenn Maxwell (because he\u2019s the true GOAT and has got to be in any list he\u2019s even vaguely eligible for), Peter Siddle, Merv Hughes, and Shane Warne. \u201cThis team is admittedly a bit light on bowling, but it\u2019s the best I, as a sixteen year old Indian, could come up with after research on the internet and banking on my remembrance of the merits of modern players. Your thoughts?\u201d That\u2019s a very good effort, young man. Bill Johnston might be worth a look. And as much as I enjoyed Brad Hodge, I don\u2019t think he would have himself in this team. 11th over: Australia 58-0 (Finch 38, Warner 18) Target 208 With the field out, it\u2019s time for spin via the journeyman Mohammad Nabi. I read somewhere the other day that he has played international cricket against 35 countries (correct me if I have remembered that wrong) across his amazing journey in the sport. Warner, who plays with the offspinner at Sunrisers Hyderabad, takes one to cover then Finch deflects a couple behind point before carefully defending the rest. They know Nabi is a man they have to show plenty of respect to. \u201cI\u2019m reminded of the 12th Man impression of Bill Lawry - \u201cGot him, yes!\u201d - and the love of fellow Victorians,\u201d emails Huw Swanborough. Yes, a major part of my childhood a well. \u201cFor my choice of Victorians, how could anyone look past Merv Hughes?\u201d A very fair nomination if we were going to do that team, but I reckon this will be more fun if we decide on an XI of those who played only during the reign of Queen Victoria. How\u2019s that sound? Hit me up. 10th over: Australia 55-0 (Finch 36, Warner 17) Target 208 For the the final over of the power play, the captain Gulbadin brings himself on for his right-arm belt-and-braces medium pace. He\u2019s right on the money straight away to Warner, who plays the first half of the set watchfully before grabbing one to midwicket. Finch then plays out the rest defensively, too. An excellent start from the skipper. 9th over: Australia 54-0 (Finch 36, Warner 16) Target 208 Finch makes his mind up to take on Zadran while the field is up, waiting for a short ball before loading up and smashing him over the midwicket rope, the longest boundary on this field. Overcompensating at the end of the set, he is able to lean safely into a classical cover drive, through the gap and away for four more. Zadran has a gorgeous outswinger but he\u2019s not getting any meaningful movement at the moment. 8th over: Australia 44-0 (Finch 26, Warner 16) Target 208 A second maiden from Hamid Hasan to Warner! This is an excellent, accurate spell. It\u2019s such a shame that he has missed the bulk of the last four years on the bench injured but he\u2019s back for the tournament that matters most, so let\u2019s enjoy his skill and passion. 7th over: Australia 44-0 (Finch 26, Warner 16) Target 208 Dawlat is tailing the ball nicely back towards Warner, who plays him with respect until a shorter ball comes, which he tries to pull but doesn\u2019t get much of it. Finch tucks a couple off the pads after watching a bouncer fly through that is called a wide. Without wanting to state the bleedingly obvious, they need to get rid of one of these fellas right away to give Rashid Khan a chance to start at Khawaja while both men are fresh. 6th over: Australia 40-0 (Finch 24, Warner 15) Target 208 Warner has been DROPPED at first slip. Urrrgh, Hasan deserved an early breakthrough but he\u2019s let down by Rahmat at slip moving too slowly to his left. In response, he sends one down at 90mph! This is proper fast bowling, don\u2019t worry about that. In now at Finch, he cuts him in half and they are up for caught behind but they don\u2019t get the decision they want and decline the chance to go upstairs. The eventful over continues with a short ball that bites Finch on the tummy. It won\u2019t look that impressive in the scorebook with five runs taken from it but that was a fine set. \u201cYou mention Finch as a Victorian (3rd over),\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cAs the Beeb are running several programmes, art, science, culture generally, to celebrate 200 years since Victoria was born, how about a documentary on famous Victorian cricketers (both senses). Could you make up an XI?\u201d Good grief, what a challenge. Shall we try and do the Victorian era rather than the state of Victoria? I am here to learn. I have Scyld Berry, the Telegraph\u2019s mighty correspondent, sitting next to me. Having literally written the history of cricket in an acclaimed book four years ago, I am sure he will have a nomination or two. 5th over: Australia 35-0 (Finch 24, Warner 10) Target 208 Giving up 24 in two overs, Mujeeb has been dragged. He\u2019s usually been very good at the start of an innings, never going for more than 13 in the first couple of overs when operating with the new ball, Andy Z tells me on TMS. Dawlat Zadran with his lovely, classical bowling action is replacing him. Four years ago in this corresponding fixture he had the Australians in trouble for about four overs before they slapped 400-odd, Warner making a massive ton. He\u2019s overstepped to begin here though, giving the former vice-captain a free hit. Sure enough, clearing the front leg, he slaps it right back over his head for a boundary - his first this evening. The seamer improves as he goes on, giving away just one further single. 4th over: Australia 29-0 (Finch 24, Warner 5) Target 208 Hamid hits 89mph on the radar early in the over then 88mph later... Great Scot! He deserves a lot better than a boundary from his final ball, via a thick Finch edge. That ends two excellent overs from the man with the zinc. I\u2019m so glad he\u2019s back in an Afghanistan shirt. 3rd over: Australia 24-0 (Finch 20, Warner 4) Target 208 Great stat from Andy Zaltzman on TMS, the nine runs scored by Finch in the first over was the most he\u2019s taken from over number one in an ODI. Quite remarkable when you consider how heavily the Victorian has scored at the top of the list over the last eight years or so. He\u2019s taken his nine and made it 20 by the end of this Mujeeb over, lauching him looooong into the stand at long-on. That\u2019s a lovely strike, at a ground that rewards straight hitting, so short are the boundaries. When Warner gets his turn, he strokes through the gap at cover for three. Finch to finish, and he tucks away a misdirected delivery, adding another boundary. 20 from 10 balls, he is. 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (Finch 9, Warner 1) Target 208 The great Hamid Hasan, the man with the headband and war paint, is taking the new ball from the nothern end, recently back into the Afghanistan side after a long injury layoff. And he beats Warner first up with a lovely seed, angling away from the southpaw. Maintaining this line throughout the over, the punchy Aussie opener is happy enough in defence, picking out the man on the circle between backward point and cover. A maiden it is. I neglected to mention, we should chat! Email or tweet. Find me on Friendster or Four Square. ICQ or AOL. My point: this works better when we talk, even if your attention is on the other blog in Madrid. As the great meme asks, why not have both? 1st over: Australia 10-0 (Finch 9, Warner 1) Target 208 Yep, they\u2019re going to tuck in quickly alright. Finch is off the mark with a single to square leg then Warner does likewise with one in the same direction from his first ball back in the big time. Finch again, who goes crunch through cover then wallop over the circle a fraction straighter for a pair of boundaries. \u201cThere was an attempt to get a boo going,\u201d notes Graeme Swann on TMS of Warner\u2019s arrival. \u201cBut not many people joined in.\u201d The players are on the field! Yep, Warner copped a chorus of boos from the western stand, but I sense that\u2019s because this is what they are expected to do? Anyway enough of that for now: Finch is on strike, the finger spinner Mujeeb has the ball in his hand. PLAY! Thank you, Sam. Nicely done. That was quite a lot of fun towards the end, Afghanistan piling on 41 runs in 20 balls for their final two wickets. Rashid Khan, who was very much Blur over Oasis during the Britpop War, makes my heart swell. More to the point, the Afghanistan fans to my right at cow corner was giving it huge, well supported by neutral fans who would love to see them defend 207. The best bit was when they engineered a flag conga line of sorts during the second drinks break, sprinting from one length to the other, leaping over any hurdle in their way. That\u2019s the passion we\u2019re here for in this World Cup. They were also the first team to show some real fight, adding 130 after falling to 77/5 when it looked like everyone would be safely in the pub in time for the Champions League final. And look, maybe that still will be the case with Australian bound to attack this chase with Net Run Rate in mind, given that\u2019s exactly what West Indies and New Zealand have in their modest chases. We know that it will be Warner not Khawaja who partners with the captain Finch when they return in a few minutes from now - his first competitive international innings since you-know-what. Smith will do likewise at four (after Khawaja). There will be some booing, I\u2019m sure, but not much. Indeed, when Warner went to the boundary rope when Zampa was operating, there was a queue five deep for selfies and autographs. Likewise, when Smith nailed a crazy run out, there was genuine applause. My point: it\u2019s a pretty chilled out and happy afternoon here in Bristol. The perfect setting, let\u2019s hope, for a tricky little chase. An innings of bursts. First, Starc and Cummins did the damage, before Rahmat and Shahidi were able to put on fifty and frustrate their defending champion counterparts. To start with Starc - if he\u2019s swinging it, Australia look like World Cup finalists. When not, less so. His third ball today was evidence enough that he\u2019s shaping the ball, but whether he can do it consistently - and/or find the conditions to assist - will go a long way to deciding his country\u2019s tournament fortunes. Following those early wickets, Rahmat looked particularly assured before he disappointingly pushed one to Smith. Two more wickets fell soon after, before the partnership of the innings - between Najibullah and Naib, entertained everyone. Najibullah was especially enterprising, showing a cavalcade of reverse sweeps to give Zampa a hard time, and they just about clawed Afghanistan back before a bouncer barrage brought the Australians back into it. \u201cAfghanistan played some pretty fearless cricket,\u201d said Adam Zampa just now, speaking to Michael Clarke. \u201cBut we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re chasing.\u201d One got the impression there\u2019s still plenty to work on for Australia in the field. There were wides, no-balls, and more than a few misfields. They\u2019re by no means over the line here, especially if Rashid and co can break through early. To take you through it all will be Adam Collins, who will join shortly. From me, and big thanks for keeping me company through the first innings. Enjoy the second, with any luck there\u2019ll be a few twists and turns. A classic tenth wicket. Mujeeb clears to leg (I mean, really clears) and Cummins cleans up the stumps. I wouldn\u2019t say it was in stumpsplosion territory, but not far away. He finishes with three-fa. 38th over: Afghanistan 207-9 (Hamid 1, Mujeeb 13) Before Zampa got Rashid, the latter hoisted him deep over the long off fence. There were singles thereafter. Plenty to think about for the Aussie bowlers here. Not sure the guys they lined up to do the damage have necessarily done so. So Zampa does it - which flies in the face of the Aussie pace-battery theory a little. From Rashid, as valuable a cameo as you could really ask for. 27 from 11 balls. What a cricketer he is. Zampa\u2019s got Rashid leg before - the umpire\u2019s given it. Rashid\u2019s checking. He\u2019s sweeping, if anything it\u2019s missing leg. Let\u2019s see... 37th over: Afghanistan 198-8 (Rashid 21, Mujeeb 11) Oh man, now ten from this over. Mujeeb Ur Rahman smokes one through mid-wicket from ball two, before a leg-clearing top edge flies for six later in the over, Cummins appeared to destroy Mujeeb\u2019s bottom hand the following ball when following him with a quick delivery, but Mujeeb is staying out there. More entertainment please, more. 36th over: Afghanistan 187-8 (Rashid 21, Mujeeb 0) Khan goes hard, and gets just rewards. It goes wide, dot, six, dot, four, four, six! hard to separate either six for shot of the over - the first is down the ground, the second is thumped over square leg! It\u2019s 21 from the over, and Afghanistan are creeping to something that might worry Australia, especially if their spinners are on song. 35th over: Afghanistan 166-8 (Rashid 1, Mujeeb 0) Cummins was hooked to the boundary before he claimed Dawlat - so from Dawlat\u2019s perspective, I guess the lesson is that it\u2019s tough to hook Cummins to the boundary consecutively. Now Cummins bounces out Dawlat. It was somewhere between a strangle and a bouncer. Cummins dug it in, Dawlat could only fend it around the corner, and Carey took an easy catch. He thwacks the ground with his bat when he departs. This has turned around very quickly. 34th over: Afghanistan 162-7 (Rashid 1, Dawlat 0) Stoinis manages a double break-through, bringing both Rashid Khan and Dawlat Zadran to the crease. Before Najibullah went, he had a heart-in-mouth moment as he uppishly pulled Stoinis in between Cummins and Khawaja on the square leg boundary - but he went the next ball he faced anyway. Credit to Stoinis - the bouncer surprised two set batsmen. It now brings two newies. Now Najibullah goes! This was a carbon copy of Naib\u2019s dismissal, but reversed for the left-hander. Clears his leg, attempts to slap the Stoinis short ball, but it\u2019s too quick on him. It\u2019s a slightly easier catch for Carey (he doesn\u2019t have to come forward as far), and Afghanistan are on the back foot again. An entertaining partnership comes to an end. Naib - as has been his wont - clears the front leg to slap through the off-side, and splices it high in the air, where it\u2019s comfortably taken by Carey. Naib has helped to bring Afghanistan back into the game; credit to him. Stoinis is on the board this World Cup, too. He needed that. 33rd over: Afghanistan 160-5 (Naib 31, Najibullah 50) Najibullah is happy to clear the front leg now with regularity, but can\u2019t do too much damage to Starc this over. Still looks a fraction quick - no shame in it. Then a ripsnorting short one rears up at Najibullah - he executes a cover-my-face-and-helmet-with-gloves-while-standing-on-one-leg to perfection. It hits the gloves, flies over Carey\u2019s head for four, and that\u2019s his fifty! It comes from 46 balls, and what a knock. 32nd over: Afghanistan 153-5 (Naib 31, Najibullah 45) Regular rotation now for both batsmen, who manoeuvre Coulter-Nile around with ease. The over is capped perfectly when Naib strikes the West Aussie long and high over long-on for six, making it a twelve run over. Rashid Khan will be liking this! Interestingly, hard to see what Australia\u2019s answer is here. 31st over: Afghanistan 143-5 (Naib 24, Najibullah 42) Two more boundaries for the Afghani\u2019s, this time from Starc\u2019s bowling. Again an effort to knock over some middle-lower order batting with pace, again it comes unstuck. Starc was first helped around the corner for a boundary from Najibullah\u2019s blade, before Naib swiped one over mid on to finish the over. Onwards, Afghanistan! Looks like the Afghani crowd are loving it - as you would. 30th over: Afghanistan 134-5 (Naib 20, Najibullah 37) So the fifty run partnership came up last over, at a run a ball. A 22-run over will help that cause, I\u2019d venture. Suspect Zampa will be given a rest now. Coulter-Nile continues here, conceding an inside-edged one after Naib tried to put him in the stands, and then a wide, before another one is conceded through overthrows. Naib then swings one to deep midwicket for two, and suddenly this is getting quite entertaining. It\u2019s only five from the over, but there\u2019s clear intent from these two. Can they get 250? Drinks 29th over: Afghanistan 129-5 (Naib 17, Najibullah 36) A few singles to start the over before Najibullah executes a lovely, finessed lap from Zampa\u2019s bowling for four - no doubt premeditated - followed by the walloping of a long hop to deep extra cover for four. And then, he hammers him over long on for six! And, oh yes, another six - this time from a full toss! It sails over midwicket, making it 22 from the over and lifting Afghanistan to 129. 28th over: Afghanistan 107-5 (Naib 16, Najibullah 15) More short stuff from Coulter-Nile, and Naib is late on most of them. He gets himself a maiden for his troubles. If you missed the result of NZ v Sri Lanka, catch the Guardian report here: 27th over: Afghanistan 107-5 (Naib 16, Najibullah 15) And again, a loose third ball and a boundary makes for an over of shared spoils. This time Zampa delivers a shin high full toss, which Najibullah dispatches to the extra cover boundary, slicing it away deliberately into the gap. 26th over: Afghanistan 102-5 (Naib 15, Najibullah 11) Now Coulter-Nile gets the ball, and he\u2019s whacked through the off side midway through the over for a boundary. In keeping with the innings, that seems to be enough for both contestants, and short pitched bowling suffices for the remainder, where there\u2019s no runs. 25th over: Afghanistan 98-5 (Naib 15, Najibullah 7) Oooh, yes. Najibullah reverse brooms Zampa hard behind square for a boundary - probably the most satisfying shot of the day. He then hoicks him with similar intent, but far less precision, and gets one. A productive over though - seven from it - before Zampa finishes. A great insight from Peter Salmon here: Hi Sam, Only played each other twice but worth noting the big role Afghanistan has played in Oz history, building the a fair bit if the railway from Adelaide to Darwin (hence \u2018The Ghan\u2019) and introducing the first 24 camels for the Burke and Wills expedition. Now there\u2019s 1.2 million of them, doubling every 8-9 years, making it the biggest camel population in the world. So to the Afghans, May your score increase exponentially, like a camel population in the Simpson Desert! Cheers Pete Lovely note, Peter. Thanks 24th over: Afghanistan 91-5 (Naib 14, Najibullah 1) Almost nothing in Najibullah\u2019s half this over, which the new batsman handles well enough before grabbing a single from the fifth ball. One from it. Now, Zampa is returning. I think this is a good move. 23rd over: Afghanistan 90-5 (Naib 14, Najibullah 0) Stoinis continues, and puts together five dots either side of a shovelled Naib boundary through midwicket. There were muffled cries of \u201ccatch it\u201d, but it was more hope than expectation. Can Afghanistan rebuild? 22nd over: Afghanistan 86-5 (Naib 9, Najibullah 0) Cummins is reintroduced (why wouldn\u2019t you let Zampa continue?) reinforcing the idea Australia thinks it can destroy the Afghani lower order with pace. He concedes nine via two well-timed slogs through cow corner. It probably signals that chances will also come. Just wonder whether Zampa should have been rewarded. 21st over: Afghanistan 77-5 (Naib 1, Najibullah 0) Stoinis is straight, there\u2019s a run-out, and it\u2019s a wicket-maiden for Australia. There\u2019s some talk about whether Naib burnt Nabi there - I don\u2019t think so. Think it was just very good fielding from Smith. I mean, as striker, you really shouldn\u2019t commit until the ball is through the ring - Nabi had hit is hard enough to warrant seeing whether Smith was going to get it or not. Brilliant piece of fielding from Steve Smith, who sprawls to his left to cut off Nabi\u2019s stroke through the covers. He gathers cleanly, Nabi is sent back from Naib (should he have gone?) and Smith steadies, before throwing to Carey who takes the bails. Afghanistan in trouble now. 20th over: Afghanistan 77-4 (Naib 1, Nabi 7) So Zampa keeps things ticking for Australia. He\u2019s got such a huge role to play if they\u2019re to progress deep in to the tournament. He\u2019s started well today. Not so much big turn as well controlled pace, flight and spin variation. Rahmat departs - he\u2019s beaten in flight by Zampa, advancing down the wicket in an attempt to swipe Zampa wide of extra-cover. He\u2019s not there, and it hits high on his bat and travels low to Steve Smith at short extra cover, who takes it low to his left. 19th over: Afghanistan 75-3 (Rahmat 43, Nabi 6) Stoinis replaces Starc, who we can confirm was back for two overs to try and pick up a wicket. Australia will now settle into their middle overs combinations, presumably. Can\u2019t say it will overly threaten other sides. Afghanistan are happy to retain wickets, Australia now happy to contain runs. Two from the over. Singles. Nice shot from Adam Collins (who will steward the OBO second innings), picking up Zampa\u2019s wrong-un. 18th over: Afghanistan 73-3 (Rahmat 42, Nabi 5) Great middle-overs test for Australia here, where wickets are key. Pace is their weapon, and they\u2019ve opted for the Starc and Zampa axis to bring them something. Zampa concedes just two from the over. Is it building pressure? If so, on whom? 17th over: Afghanistan 70-3 (Rahmat 41, Nabi 3) Starc goes again, but when the radar\u2019s off, opportunity abounds. He goes searching for fullness with his third delivery, and Rahmat leans on him through the off side for four, taking him into the forties. Starc comes around the wicket to Nabi (not sure if it\u2019s the angle but it always looks dangerous), and Nabi is able to finid one to third man. Six from the over, and Afghanistan roll on. 16th over: Afghanistan 64-3 (Rahmat 36, Nabi 2) Zampa drops short and Rahmat heaves him over midwicket for a boundary, imperiously so. By that I mean he held his pose for a dramatically long period of time post-shot - and I welcome it. There are two singles otherwise, and another successful over for Afghanistan. 15th over: Afghanistan 58-3 (Rahmat 31, Nabi 1) Mitchell Starc is back - presumably in the search for a few wickets as they\u2019d rarely go to him now in similar situations - and gets through a maiden. Nabi looks more comfortable than the others in dealing with his pace. 14th over: Afghanistan 57-3 (Rahmat 31, Nabi 1) Zampa gets the wicket, though both Rahmat and Shahidi looked prepared to try and take him down beforehand. Will be interesting to see how they attack Zampa next over - he might be the target. In response to Romeo\u2019s question about Afghani commentators at the World Cup (or lack thereof), Andrew writes in: \u201cHello Sam,\u201d he says. \u201cPerhaps there are no Afghan commentators because the 900 year old brick-built Minaret of Jam is on the verge of collapse and the\u2019ye got more important things to do! Best regards, Andrew Benton\u201d The left-handed Shahidi runs past one, as a Zampa leg-break slides past his advance. A little bobble from Alex Carey preceded the bail-breaking, but nothing too dramatic. Some nice shots from the number four, but the pace had him well contained in the main. 13th over: Afghanistan 51-2 (Rahmat 27, Shahidi 17) Afghanistan brings up its fifty to jovial applause around the ground. It was via a sweetly timed cover drive for two from Shahidi, who is looking better by the over. He plays an misses later on, and otherwise there\u2019s no run. An interesting one here as 3.92rpo isn\u2019t world class, and yet Australia can\u2019t get the breakthrough. Looks like Zampa\u2019s coming on next. 12th over: Afghanistan 49-2 (Rahmat 27, Shahidi 15) Suggestion from Michael Slater and Wasim Akram on TV comms that Australia might be utilising the West Indies\u2019 strategy from yesterday. That is, bumpers. Except on this occasion Stoinis twice falters - gifting wides with similar attempts. It\u2019s not too costly, as there\u2019s only a single otherwise. But the crowd are coming into it - the Afghani\u2019s have steadied. 11th over: Afghanistan 45-2 (Rahmat 26, Shahidi 14) Shahidi breaks the 140kph-imposed shackles, and biffs Coulter-Nile for four through cover, with some assistance from a nearby practice wicket. He then tries to pull Coulter-Nile and gets one of those deep-travelling edges that lands one bounce from the fence for another boundary. Eight from the over - handy runs. 10th over: Afghanistan 37-2 (Rahmat 26, Shahidi 6) The Adonis himself, Mr Stoinis, joins the fray, and he\u2019s met with a muscular pull from Rahmat on ball four. The senior established bat is otherwise subdued, but a nice win for him there. 9th over: Afghanistan 33-2 (Rahmat 22, Shahidi 6) They\u2019re cheering every Afghani run at Bristol. Following three Rahmat play-and-misses to Coulter-Nile, Rahmat manages an inside edge, much to the joy of the Bristol faithful. Another tight over then - only one from it - though this partnership is building. 8th over: Afghanistan 32-2 (Rahmat 21, Shahidi 6) Rahmat warming to the task now. He\u2019s 21 from 27 after he finds a comfortable single into the cover region - he looks in control against both Cummins and Coulter-Nile. That single precedes a wide from Cummins to the left-handed Shahidi, and Cummins offers a wry smile. They\u2019re not overly clean here, Australia - possibly a little frustrated after such a fast start. Cummins then manages four dot balls to Shahidi to tidy up matters. Looking for some help here following an email from Romeo: \u201cHi Sam,\u201d he says. \u201cWho is the Afghan commentator in the ICC\u2019s selected group for this tournament? Is there one? Hamid Hassan was excellent in the Ireland series, but of course he\u2019s playing now. If there isn\u2019t an Afghan commentator at all, I want to know why not.\u201d Any ideas out there? 7th over: Afghanistan 30-2 (Rahmat 20, Shahidi 6) Coulter-Nile is introduced and he gets some tap! He looks just off the pace of Starc and Cummins (not hard), and goes 1lb, dot, four, wide, one, dot, dot. Six from it - multiple lengths, multiple lines. The four was a glorious flick through the on-side, while later in the over we see a second misfield from Glenn Maxwell at backward point. Strange areas from him. 6th over: Afghanistan 23-2 (Rahmat 15, Shahidi 6) Cummins keeps Rahmat pegged back in his crease until the first drop chances his arm, and hooks Cummins to the boundary for four! Man, would love to be able to tell a grandkid I hooked Pat Cummins for four at a World Cup. Phil Withall (g\u2019day Phil), writes: \u201cEvening Sam, Afganistan seem to have made a bit of a mistake in attempting to take the game to the Australians. Surely a more measured approach in the first 10 overs would have made more sense. I know it is the norm to try and smack the ball hard from the off but against this opening attack less could well mean more.\u201d I\u2019m not sure. If they sit and defend, they\u2019re sitting ducks aren\u2019t they? It\u2019s the powerplay; you have to try and capitalise on the field being up. 5th over: Afghanistan 19-2 (Rahmat 11, Shahidi 6) So far the Afghani plan is to keep reasonably balanced and wait for the Australians to bowl too straight, or offer width. It\u2019s not the worst approach, as Shahidi find a single to fine leg and Rahmat gets flays his hands at one later on, getting one to third man. At one point there\u2019s a sound as the ball flicks past Rahmat\u2019s hip, and it sounds woody. It\u2019s given not out, and Finch declines the review. He\u2019s correct to do so. 4th over: Afghanistan 17-2 (Rahmat 10, Shahidi 5) Cummins warming into his work, but he concedes six from it. He\u2019s just back of a length for the majority of the over, with one bouncer hammering Rahmat\u2019s gloves, popping up and falling short of the quick. The final ball sees an inside edge race for four: there\u2019s no footwork, and the pace sees the ball rocket into the fence. 3rd over: Afghanistan 10-2 (Rahmat 4, Shahidi 5) Starc gets six balls at Shahidi. The first is cracked through the covers for four, before the left arm quick comes back with a bumper. The next just falls short of second slip, then there\u2019s a wide, before Starc cranks it up to 150kph. The whole thing is very Mitchell Starc. 2nd over: Afghanistan 6-2 (Rahmat 4, Shahidi 1) It\u2019s Cummins from the other end - and it\u2019s a no-ball first up! Replays show it was exceptionally close, but it\u2019s registered. The free hit is spliced high and taken by Coulter-Nile, before Cummins inflicts meaningful damage via an Hazratullah edge to Carey. The bowling looks that smidgen too quick for the Afghani\u2019s here - at least early on. It will settle to some extent, I\u2019m sure. Cummins gives Hazratullah some width and the batsman obliges only in offering a big feet-less swipe, gaining a healthy edge that\u2019s taken at head height by Carey. 1st over: Afghanistan 3-1 (Rahmat 3, Hazratullah 0) Starc takes the first ball; can he elicit any swing? The first two not so much. The third, well, you can see the result below. Takeaways? Starc looks pretty quick - certainly too quick for Shahzad. A nice little whip for three followed, and that was all she wrote. Bowled him! Classic Starc. Full. A little swing. 95+ mph, and stumps everywhere. Shades of McCullum in the 2015 final. One of the dirtiest swipes across the line you\u2019ll see, too. Quick. Anthems are done What a stirring anthem the Afghanis have. It\u2019s Warner and Smith\u2019s first official match back since the Sandpaper affair My tip? Smith will gluttonously compensate for his time out. Think it\u2019s a little more complicated for his compatriot. One via email A question from Abhijarto Sensarma: \u201cAfghanistan and Australia have faced off twice in ODIs,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first time, Afghanistan scored 206, and the next time they scored 142. The sum of the digits of the first score is 8, while the sum of digits of the next one decreases by 1 and the sum is 7. Australia, on the other hand, scored 272 the first time around and 417 the next time. The sum of digits of the first score adds up to 11, while the sum of the digits of the next increases by 1and the sum is 12.Considering this as well as my overcalculative self in mind, I have to ask ask the question: will we see Afghanistan score\u2019s digits add up to 6 while Australia\u2019s add up to 13 to keep up with the unlikely pattern?\u201d Without doubt, Abhijarto! Khawaja in / 3 quicks and a spinner So Khawaja beats Marsh to that final batting spot. Finch said: \u201cUsman\u2019s form over the last 14-15 games was too good to ignore. Really tough call but we had to make it.\u201d There was a school of thought that Lyon would form a duel-brotherhood with Zampa, but Australia have stuck with its meat-and-three veg approach, and Coulter-Nile is in as the third quick. Teams Afghanistan have won the toss and have elected to bat It\u2019s Sanjay Manjrekar, both captains, match referee Ranjan Madugalle and a coin. Naib flips, Finch says tails, it lands heads. Naib says the wicket looks good and flat - that they\u2019re aiming to post a good total, and to come home with three spinners. Sound logic! No news yet on Khawaja or Marsh Lots of conjecture about this one in Australia. Easy to forget that there\u2019s ten games, and this author can easily see all 15 players being afforded an opportunity. Both players really are very similar in terms of what they offer with the bat: control, rotation of the strike, decent averages. Both are at similar ends of Australia\u2019s fielding bell curve too. Will be interesting to see which way it goes, but only insofar as understanding who has the inside running at this point. Let\u2019s start big, and narrow in There\u2019s been so much talk about where cricket sits in the English sporting ecosystem of late. I found yesterday\u2019s Guardian editorial interesting on the topic; it can be easy to get mired in the x\u2019s and o\u2019s of broadcast money, the influence of digital, and so forth - and similarly easy to forget those that get out there and play. Here\u2019s the piece for your perusal: Hello and welcome... To The Guardian\u2019s second piece of World Cup cricketing livebloggery today. Whether the body clock is telling you to discard this match for sweet, sweet sleep in Australia, whether you\u2019re crowded around a TV in Kabul, or whether you\u2019re nervously passing the time before Liverpool v Tottenham in Madrid tonight - it doesn\u2019t matter. You are here, and for one reason or another free, willing and keen to understand the ins, outs, ups, downs and associated carry-on ahead of \u201cODI 4 of 48\u201d (the Google convention): Australia v Afghanistan, from Bristol I can tell you this: it\u2019s partly cloudy and 23 degrees in England\u2019s South West. Australia start favourites - but, well - we\u2019re due a boilover soon, surely? I\u2019ll bring you team news, toss news, some colour, background and all sorts as we build up to the first ball. In the meantime, enjoy these strange Kangaroo suits apparently bouncing around Bristol. And if you want to chat, it\u2019s sam.perry.freelance@guardian.co.uk, or @sjjperry via Twitter.",

      "bodyText": "Thanks for joining all of us today. Lots of big names gone. Bye. Kenin says she\u2019s very emotional and pays tribute to Serena Williams and the crowd, despite many of them booing her during the game for beating their hero. She starts to cry, which is nice, but she really just wants to go and celebrate with her coach and family. It\u2019s a very promising start for Kenin as a wicked serve is returned to the net but she then slaps a shot across court and wide despite looking in charge of the point. Kenin then hits one long, much to her chagrin. Kenin nails the line on a serve to level at 30:30. A woeful backhand goes very long from Kenin. She looks like she\u2019s panicking a little now. Williams then mishits a forehand wide to take it to deuce. There is plenty of pressure on the court at the moment. Kenin gets the advantage after an outstretched Williams only just gets the serve over the net, allowing Kenin to whack a winner into space. Match point: Kenin sends one into the net when she has the chance to win it! Kenin against nails the line with the serve, setting up her chance to win, which she gleefully takes. Match Point II: A long back backhand from Williams gives Kenin the win!!!! An easy chance to win the opening point for Williams results it her smashing in long when she has plenty of court to play with. Kenin just about returns a great serve and then Williams sends a backhand wide. Williams pushes Kenin around, forcing to snatch at a forehand which flies wide. Kenin gets two break points after a poor backhand goes long again, as Williams overplays. A big serve keeps Williams in it. Kenin breaks with a cracking forehand which passes Williams, who can only clap the shot in response. Kenin to serve for the win. Kenin leads 2-6, 5-6. Williams returns a very slow serve into the net for no reason whatsoever. The sends one very long, gifting Kenin the lead. Kenin is in charge as Williams sends another too far and then Kenin sends a backhand beyond Williams to hold to love. Kenin leads 2-6, 5-5. Williams takes control of her service game, quickly moving 30:0 up, thanks to a cracking serve and then a tame backhand into the net from Kenin. The 20-year-old Kenin makes up with a cutting backhand next time around to bring her back into it. Williams then double faults, a rare sight, to make it level. Her next first serve tamely hits the net but her second finds the spot and she goes on to move Kenin around the court, allowing her to whack a winner into space. Serena holds. Score is 2-6, 5-4. At 30:30 Williams whacks one a little long to give Kenin the advantage. Kenin holds her nerve with a great serve and eventually Williams loops one over the baseline to square the second set score at 4-4. Kenin leads 6-2, 4-4. And with that, I\u2019ll hand over to Will Unwin to take you through to the end of this one. Woof. Serena holds to 15, battering a serve down the middle to nudge ahead in the second set. She\u2019s looked much better in this set and that\u2019s just rewards. 6-2, 3-4 in the second. Kenin looked like she was heading for a relatively straightforward hold, but Williams pegs her back with gusto, snagging herself four break points...and she takes the fourth! A Kenin cross-court backhand hammers the top of the net and sails out. 6-2, 3-3. Game v much on. Eeesh. Serena holds, sealing the game with a brilliant inside-out forehand, but what preceded it was more representative of the match as a whole, with as much time as she liked to nail a half-court forehand with Kenin nowhere, but she seemed to slip slightly and belted it straight into the net, before looking at the clay as if it had betrayed her in the most cruel fashion. 6-2, 3-2 Kenin with that break in the second set. If you were to replace the players with two featureless, blank robots, you\u2019d guess the one flaying forehands all over the show and controlling rallies despite game resistance was Serena. Not so. Kenin holds to make it 6-2, 3-1. A big part of that is down to the number of unforced errors from Serena - the tally is 14-3 at the moment. Some more big roaring from Serena, plus Kenin shrewdly getting the eff out of the way with both players at the net and her opponent winding up for a boomer, and it\u2019s 6-2, 2-1. And for those who can\u2019t be bothered to read any lower: that\u2019s to Kenin... Serena lets out something close to a roar with two rocket-powered shots in the second game of the second set, but that\u2019s as far as her resistance goes in that one as Kenin steams back in with some fizzers of her own. 6-2, 2-0.... Wowsers. Kenin breaks to love in the first game of the second set. Serena in some bother here. Kenin wins the first set 6-2 Serena screams in anguish and looks accusingly at the clay after netting to set up set point. Kenin thinks she has it all tied up after a Serena return goes long, but it turns out her serve was wide! But after Serena gets a break point, some belting cross-courts bring Kenin another break point, which is converted when Serena nets a return. Kenin bellows in delight and strides back to her chair. Game on. One of Kenin\u2019s strategies looks like will be to pull Serena around the court, which she does with another of those drop-shots...and then bags a double break with a brilliant cross-court forehand! 5-2 in the first set, and she\u2019s about to serve for it. Kenin is playing some seriously impressive forehands. Serena has a few shots herself, setting up a break point with a fine overhead. But, Kenin manages to hold after Serena sticks a forehand of her own long. Are we on for an upset here? Kenin isn\u2019t seeded although she is ranked 35 in the world, so clearly no chump, but still. Meanwhile Khachanov indeed sealed that victory, beating Klizan 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 to book his next round game against Del Potro. Serena pulls a couple of big serves out of the bag to save a couple of break points...but she can\u2019t save them all as Kenin sticks a wonderful backhand dropshot over the net, and gets the first break of the match. 3-2 to her in the first. The burly Argentinean sends down a booming ace to wrap up what turned out to be a straightforward victory. He\u2019ll now play the winner of Karen Khachanov and Martin Klizan, which is currently in play but the former is 6-1, 6-4, 5-2 ahead, so the end there is nigh. The final set was slightly more of a struggle than it initially looked like it might be, but Thiem bags his win with a big overhead and salutes the crowd, looking absolutely delighted with himself, and rightly so. It\u2019s Monfils next for the Austrian. Serena and Kenin are playing with three-quarters of the court in shade and the remaining 25% in bright sunshine, which is aesthetically vexing. Still, it doesn\u2019t seem to have bothered either player too much, as they both hold without too many problems in their respective first service games. 1-1. Break on Lenglen! Thiem is now serving for the match after taking a 6-5 lead - already up 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 - in the fourth set. Del Potro is blazing away on Simonne-Mathieu - he\u2019s broken twice in the third and is serving to go 4-0 up. He\u2019s 6-4, 6-4 ahead. Serena and Sofia Kenin are knocking up on Philippe-Chatrier now. Worth remembering that this is in the Osaka half of the draw, meaning the whole thing has opened up just a little bit more. The winners of this one will face the winners of Ashleigh Barty and Andrea Petkovic, who\u2019ll play on Suzanne-Lenglen when Thiem vs Cuevas has finished. Seapking of which, Thiem is currently serving to stay in the fourth set at 4-5. Martin Del Potro successfully served for that second set a while back, now ahead 6-4, 6-4 over Jordan Thompson. Meanwhile Cuevas has just won a fairly epic sixth game of the fourth set against Thiem, breaking back to level things up. It\u2019s current 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 3-3 in Thiem\u2019s favour. Evening all. My first duty is to tell you that Gael Monfils has sealed his victory over Hoang, celebrating with a primal scream in the middle of the court. He wrapped up a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victory with a booming forehand and saunters through to the next round, where he\u2019ll play the winner of the Thiem vs Cuevas. Serena is next up on Philippe-Chatrier. And that\u2019s all from me. Over to my esteemed colleague Nick Miller to guide you through the evening\u2019s events. Thiem wastes no time in breaking in what could very well be the final set, before holding his service game with ease. On Court Simonne-Mathieu, Del Portro readies himself to serve for the second set. Hoang is making a fight of the third set against Monfils, and leads 3-2 with a break apiece. He hits an ace before both slope to the sidelines, bathed in sweat. Serving for the third set, Thiem allows some untidiness into his play \u2013 sending a forehand badly long \u2013 before rolling up his sleeves and sealing the set with a pair of second serves that prove too much for Cuesta. The Austrian leads 6-3, 4-6, 6-2. Thiem has responded to that wobbly second set in the competitor\u2019s time-honoured fashion: by coming out swinging. He\u2019s blasted his way to a 4-1 third-set lead, not an iota of energy wasted. Khachanov steamrollers through his first set against Klizan, 6-1 in 23 minutes. And Monfils has taken the second set against Hoang with only slightly less ease, 6-2. Juan Martin Del Potro takes the first set, 6-4, against a battling Jordan Thompson. Monfils serves to go two sets up against Hoang. Something of a surprise on Court Suzanne-Lenglen as Cuevas steams through his own service game before springing a break on Thiem to take the second set off the Austrian. He\u2019s hardly been terrible, but he\u2019ll need to step it up here. The men\u2019s No 10 seed, Karen Khachanov, has kicked off his match against Martin Klizan, with each having held on to their first service game. Del Potro is a break up on Thompson, who he leads 5-4, and is serving for the first set. And the bleep test of a match between Struff and Coric has finally reached an end, Struff clinching an 11-9 final-set win Thiem eases through the gears to force an up-for-it Cuevas into a series of superlative rallies. The Uruguayan does superbly on each count but just doesn\u2019t have quite enough to match the Austrian. 4-4. Cuevas leaps on a double fault by Thiem \u2013 the match\u2019s first \u2013 to break his opponent and take a 4-2 lead in the second. This mightn\u2019t be quite as easy for the No 4 seed as it first seemed. Struff and Coric are edging towards double figures in the fifth set. The Croatian has just made it 9-9 In fact, she doesn\u2019t even need her service game in the end. Swiatek breaks Puig to end the match \u2013 which she began with a 0-6 first-set battering \u2013 and advance to the fourth round of a grand slam. What were you doing at 18? And Monfils has taken the first set against his countryman Hoang, 5-3. Elsewhere, Juan Martin del Portro has begun his match with Australia\u2019s Jordan Thompson, and gobbled up the first two games. Oh, and Iga \u015awi\u0105tek \u2013 who turned 18 yesterday \u2013 will shortly be serving for the match against Monica Puig. Struff v Coric stretches on into its fifth hour. The German is 8-7 up in the final set as his opponent serves. Here\u2019s our report on Naomi Osaka\u2019s bizarre collapse: At the fifth time of asking, Thiem takes his set point. He does the job with a tidy ace, and looks to be finding his rhythm here. Very little between Hoang and Monfils so far, the latter leading 3-2 in the first set with neither player having broken. Coric is serving for the match against Struff, but it\u2019s the German who has taken the first two points of the game. Thiem breaks back, and follows it up with the first showcase of his power. A series of bludgeoned forehands is too much for a retreating Cuevas who suddenly finds himself 4-2 down. The Russian wins the first point but looks spent, and Keys finishes the game with an elegant chipped drop-shot. She allows herself a businesslike pump of the fist before embracing her opponent and retiring to the sideline to pack up her gear. Three match points for Madison Keys, 40-0 up on Blinkova\u2019s service game. Coric and Struff look destined to be separated by the finest of margins. There\u2019s been barely anything between them for a whie now, and they remain neck and neck in the final set, 4-4. Lively start: Cuevas snaffles up Thiem\u2019s first service game to go 2-0 early doors. Next up on Court Philippe Chatrier is a local derby between Antoine Hoang and Ga\u00ebl Monfils, while also starting shortly is Dominic Thiem\u2019s showdown with Pablo Cuevas, the 47th-ranked Uruguayan who saw off Kyle Edmund in the second round. No surprises there. Djokovic becomes the day\u2019s first big name to get through a match without wobbling hideously along the way. He made even lighter work of the final set than the first two, and while it\u2019s early days, that win looks faintly ominous. An unfathomably shoddy performance from the world No 1, who has hit her last ball in this tournament. Siniakova earned her win with vim, vigour and wit, and is suitably gleeful. But the real story is Osaka\u2019s baffling collapse. astonishingly, that means three of the top four women\u2019s seeds have been knocked out \u2013 before the fourth round! Two match points for Siniakova. Thirty-seven unforced errors for Osaka. Djokovic breaks in the third to go 4-2 up. Victory draws to within touching distance for him. Siniakova accepts \u2013 5-2 \u2013 and will serve for the match. Yet another feeble shot into the net from Osaka, which has been her signature move this afternoon. Then she thrashes one long to offer a double break point to Siniakova. Blinkova claws herself back from the brink, breaking Keys, holding her own serve and then taking the second-set tie-break. One set each. Osaka is doing her best to continue the day\u2019s theme of deeply unconvincing displays from heavyweights. Unforced errors galore from her this afternoon, and she goes a break down in the second set. It\u2019s getting worrying for her. Madison Keys has broken Blinkova in the second set, which she now leads 6-5, and will serve for the match. A service game apiece for Osaka and a shrieking Siniakova makes it 1-1 in the second. Struff and Coric, meanwhile, look to be edging towards a fourth-set tie-break, the latter having just gone 6-5 up. Caruso is increasingly wearing a look of pained exhaustion in his match against Djokovic. Not a bead of sweat on him, the Serb swats a backhand out of his opponent\u2019s reach to take the second set by the same margin as the first: 6-3. Siniakova comes through a lengthy service game to take the first, 44-minute set against Osaka. Didn\u2019t see that one coming. Meanwhile the No 14 seed, Madison Keys, is a set up against Anna Blinkova. No 1 seed Naomi Osaka is being put firmly through her paces by Katerina Siniakova, who has just gone 5-4 up in the opening set with the match\u2019s first break. Stan Wawrinka progresses! He had to do it the hard way, beating Grigor Dimitrov in three straight tie-breaks to win 7-6 (5), 7-6 (4) and 7-6 (8). Djokovic has broken in the second, while Osaka and Siniakova are locked at four games all in the first. No 9 seed and certified dark horse Fabio Fognini is into the last 16, beating Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6 (5), 6-4, 4-6, 6-1. Naomi Osaka will be next on Suzanne-Lenglen, taking on Czech player Katerina Siniakova. A relatively straightforward final set for the No 5 seed after he lurched into serious trouble by losing the third and fourth. He finishes Lajovic off with a no-nonsense service game and advances to the fourth round \u2013 but that\u2019s the day\u2019s second unconvincing win from a men\u2019s heavyweight. Djokovic breaks Caruso to go 3-1 up early on. Lajovic gives up his service game cheaply and now Zverev will serve for the match. Struff levels things up against Coric, taking the second set. Zverev inches towards victory, 4-2 up now in the fifth and playing with something resembling confidence. Having taken the first set, Coric is 5-1 down in the second against Struff. Thirty places separate the two in the ATP rankings. Djokovic v Caruso is under way. Both men take their opening service games. A break each in set five for Zverev and Lajovic takes it to 2-2. Both are playing with wild inconsistency. Stan Wawrinka has resumed his match with Grigor Dimitrov. He\u2019s two sets up, 1-1 in the third. And Borna Coric leads Jan-Lennard Struff having taken the first set 6-4. Djokovic limbers up on centre court. Bautista-Agut has taken the third set against Fognini to claw it back to 2-1. But the early signs are good. Zverev starts the fifth set by snatching Lajovic\u2019s service games off him, and follows that up with a glorious slice that evades his opponent to claim the second game. 2-0. And Zverev loses his service game, taking only one point (!) to drop the fourth set. He\u2019s in danger of falling horribly apart here, the No 5 seed. If he doesn\u2019t turn it around in this vital final set his tournament is over. Next up on Court Philippe Chatrier, after a shattered Tsitsipas is done fielding his interviewer\u2019s questions, will be the men\u2019s No 1 seed, Novak Djokovic, against the Italian Salvatore Caruso. As for Zverev, well, he\u2019s in a bit of trouble, 5-1 down now against Lajovic in the fourth set, and all after such a good start. The Serb finally accedes, returning a Tsitsipas serve way beyond the baseline to confirm the No 6 seed\u2019s win. But it was an unconvincing one \u2013 3 hours 34 minutes in all \u2013 and one in which the interruption told hugely. He\u2019ll need to up his game hugely if he\u2019s to go deep into this tournament. Match point Tsitsipas, who is 7-6 up in the tie-break \u2026 Zverev goes 2-1 down in the fourth set due to a sloppy error and hurls his racket to the ground in self-disgust. Lajovic holds his serve in unflappable style for 3-1 The second point of the tie-break delivers a great rally, ending when Krajinovic can\u2019t quite extend an arm far enough to lift the ball over the net from close range. 2-0 Tsitsipas. No mistake from the Serb. Another tie-break. Tsitsipas holds his serve emphatically, which means he\u2019s 6-5 up in the fourth and Krajinovic is now serving to stay in the match. \u2026and the next three. 5-5. In the meantime, has hit his stride against Zverev and snatched the third set, 6-4. Both these matches may go to the wire. Tsitsipas holds his serve, which leaves the fourth set there for Krajinovic to take with his upcoming service game. That would mark a huge U-turn to this match, which the Greek was breezing through when play was halted last night. But Tsitsipas takes the game\u2019s first point, 15-0. Fognini takes the second set, 6-4, against Bautista-Agut. He\u2019s two to the good against the Spaniard. Tsitsipas is wobbling alarmingly. He hands his service game to Krajinovic with two straight double faults. The Serb leads 4-3 in the fourth set, and will now serve. Zverev takes the next service game nervelessly and retires to the sideline to soak up the shade. Lajovic has Zverev on the back foot in the third set. He\u2019s 3-1 up as a frazzled-looking Zverev serves to get himself back in it. Krajinovic follows up his good start to the day with a shoddy service round that Tsitsipas takes with two break points to spare. 1-1 in the second. In the women\u2019s doubles, Stosur and Zhang have beaten Collins and Santamaria 6-4, 6-4, while Mertens and Sabalenka have seen off Kalashnikova and Peterson 6-4, 6-3. Some supreme tennis from Krajinovic in the tie-break sees him take the third set \u2013 that\u2019s 2-1 Tsitsipas. Zverev, meanwhile, throws away two set points on the advantage, but wins the third, to take the second set. He\u2019s 6-4, 6-2 up. Krajinovic lashes a laser-guided shot down the line to take the tie-break to 5-4 in his favour. Krajinovic find a bit of rhythm to take the third set to a tie-break. Tsitsipas will be out soon to resume his match against Krajinovic, which he leads 7-5, 6-3, with the third set locked at 5-5. Next door, the German McConaughey-alike Alexander Zverev looks to be hitting his stride after a wobbly first set and now leads 4-1 in the second. L-I-V-I-N. In the doubles, Gabriela Dabrowski and Yi-Fan Xu have won in straight sets \u2013 6-1, 6-1 \u2013 against Xin-Yun Han and Yafan Wang. And Forgini has taken the first set against Bautista-Agut, 7-6 on a tie-break. On Court Simonne-Mathieu, Zverev has battled back against Lajovic to take the first set 6-4. But she breaks again, ruthlessly, and takes her opponent\u2019s service game with a drop-shot from the net. That was immensely impressive from the Romanian, dropping just three games in a match that lasted a fleeting 53 minutes. Bizarre. Halep fails to win a single point in a game that featured two unforced errors from her. 5-1 Halep slams back a decent serve with a a dead-eyed forehand down the line. Unreturnable. A wearied Tsurenko mops her brow \u2013 Halep will now serve for the match. Halep powers through a flawless service game to go 4-0 up in the second. Relentless stuff \u2013 could this be done and dusted before the hour mark\u2026? And Fabio Fognini is a break up on Roberto Bautista Agut, who he leads 4-3 in another tight first set. Zverev breaks back against Lajovic to level up a knife-edge first set at 4-4. Tsurenko shows some glimpses of what she can do, pinning Halep to the baseline with a blitz of immensely powerful forehands. But then a bad miss and a some immaculate striking from her re-energised opponent mean another service game dropped. 3-0 Halep in the second. Halep breaks straight away in the second set, and has barely put a foot wrong so far. 1-0, and 30-0 up in her service game. In the women\u2019s doubles, Gabriela Dabrowski and Yi-Fan Xu have steamed into one-set lead \u2013 taking it 6-1 \u2013 over Xin-Yun Han and Yafan Wang. A wild shot from Tsurenko flies long to leave three set points for Halep. The Ukrainian claws it back to 40-30, but is wrongfooted by a smart forehand and that\u2019s the first set to Halep. In the men\u2019s singles, Lajovic has broken Zerev, who has just come back from three break points to drag it back to 3-2. He\u2019s being worked hard by Lajovic. Meanwhile, Halep is a game away from an breezy first set at 5-2. Halep breaks again \u2013 first wide again from Tsurenko then long, both careless \u2013 and that\u2019s 4-1 after 15 minutes. Looks like we\u2019ll be seeing Tsitsipas soon. Tsurenko\u2019s strong start has collapsed into a litany of cheap errors. She sends the ball wide for to make it 3-1 Halep, who isn\u2019t giving an inch. Tsurenko meekly surrenders the third game \u2013 2-1 Halep. Over on Court Simonne-Mathieu, it\u2019s a game apiece for Lajovic and Zverev. A immediate break-back from Tsurenko, who goes 30-0 down before rattling through four rapid-fire points and taking the game with a belting return. The first game goes to Halep, and it was a hard-fought one, the Romanian bringing it to 40-40 by concluding a lovely rally with a delicate drop-shot before taking the advantage with a deep cross-court drive. Tsurenko\u2019s double fault decides the game. Halep and Tsurenko have locked horns \u2013 in 24-degree heat \u2013 and it\u2019s the Ukrainian who serves first, going 30-15 up with some tidy, aggressive tennis. Johanna Konta also racked up an emphatic win. Here\u2019s a report on that and the rest of the women\u2019s single matches, including a gruelling win for Sloane Stephens: Not long now until the racketeering gets under way. In the meantime here\u2019s our correspondent\u2019s report from yesterday\u2019s men\u2019s singles action, when Federer and Nadal forged very different paths to their respective wins: The sun is beating down on Paris and we\u2019ve a tasty day of tennis ahead of us. Both the top-seeded singles players are in action in today\u2019s third-round showdowns, Novak Djokovic against Salvatore Caruso (who in his last outing dismantled the No26 seed Gilles Simon in straight sets) and Naomi Osaka against Kate\u0159ina Siniakov\u00e1, who has tasted glory before at Roland Garros in a doubles capacity. Elsewhere there\u2019s an all-American clash between Serena Wiliams and Sofia Kenin, a local derby between Antoine Hoang and Ga\u00ebl Monfils, plus the conclusion of Stefanos Tsitsipas\u2019 match-up with Filip Krajinovi\u0107. Dominic Thiem, Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro and Ashleigh Barty round off the top-10 seeds who will be put through their paces. But that\u2019s later. First up, Simone Halep takes on the Ukrainian 27th seeds Lesia Tsurenko \u2013 who saw off Aleksandra Kruni\u0107 in a hard-fought game yesterday \u2013 while over on Court Simonne-Mathieu, Alexander Zverev will be vying for a place in the last 16 with the Serbian clay-court specialist Du\u0161an Lajovi\u0107. Stay tuned!",

But that may prove only an inconvenience on his way to proving himself the best of these colts.</p> <p>While his background is not that of a conventional Derby winner, from a stable that rarely competes at the highest level and unraced until March, his performance in winning the Dante was thoroughly convincing. He broke alertly, ran fast enough to secure a handy position and then settled before finishing more strongly than a classy rival in Too Darn Hot. He will have to follow a very similar pattern and his draw is no help but at least the likely pace-setter, Sovereign, is only two stalls away in four. If Telecaster can latch on to his tail for the first furlong, the early part of the race may work out quite well for him.</p> <p>Telecaster\u2019s sire is New Approach, another free-going sort who nonetheless had the stamina to win a Derby, and his dam was also comfortable at this distance. While he has had plenty of racing in a short time, the signs show he is thriving on it and he is surprisingly backable at 5-1.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"299e0c09d0a7b4a70c6c76bd52c9d212e5ac2b25\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/299e0c09d0a7b4a70c6c76bd52c9d212e5ac2b25/0_49_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers in the stands on Derby day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers in the stands on Derby day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sir Dragonet has a better draw but has been a slow starter so far and may not make best use of it. This fast ground is a question mark for him. From the same stable, Anthony Van Dyck is more of a worry, as an experienced colt who impressed at Lingfield. Circus Maximus is also going the right way and Frankie Dettori could help him hit the frame.</p> <p>Broome and Bangkok are both professional types and unbeaten this year but they have not yet shown the necessary quality.

Aidan spent three or four minutes addressing the group, then six of them wandered back into the changing room while the trainer spent another two minutes talking to Ryan Moore. Evidently Aidan managed to set his jockey at his ease, as Ryan had a good laugh at something that was said.

I would say the top side of the home straight is Good to Firm. The temperature is about 23 degrees Celsius now and it is going to get hotter - up to 26 or 27 degrees Celsius. The courses will dry, as was shown yesterday on a much cooler and less sunny day.</p> <p>\u201cI am thinking that by the time the Investec Derby is off at 4.30pm, I am anticipating Good to Firm ground, but hopefully a decent, safe Good to Firm. We will update with any changes to the official going descriptions through the afternoon.</p> <p>\u201cI walked much of the course yesterday evening after racing and it was almost Good to Firm. The question was then how much water do we put on rather than do we water. We put on three millimetres from the mile and a half start to the six-furlong pole; left the next two furlongs, which is down the hill into the home straight which had been watered earlier in the week and we put three millimetres on the home straight down to the crossing on the pulling up area just by the Rubbing House pub.</p> <p>\u201cWe started watering about 6.30pm yesterday and the team finished around 12.30am. Those same guys were in about 4.30am this morning. It is great credit and thanks to them. There were four guys involved in the watering - the two main ones were Craig Williamson, who is the Regional Estates Manager, and Chris Youngs, the Deputy Estates Manager, who is based here at Epsom all the time.

Tickets are sent straight to user\u2019s phones and passengers will travel in an executive coach with leather seats, tables, WiFi and toilets. They can also enjoy prosecco on arrival and a selection of breakfast nibbles on board. Tickets for each day are available via the website: return travel starts from just \u00a339.99 for the <a href=\"https://zeelo.co/rides/royal-ascot/royal-ascot-2019-tuesday-15807\">Tuesday</a>, <a href=\"https://zeelo.co/rides/royal-ascot/royal-ascot-2019-wednesday-15808\">Wednesday</a> and <a href=\"https://zeelo.co/rides/royal-ascot/royal-ascot-2019-friday-15810\">Friday</a> meets. <a href=\"https://zeelo.co/rides/royal-ascot/royal-ascot-2019-saturday-15811\">Saturday</a>\u2019s meet is \u00a349.99 return, with <a href=\"https://zeelo.co/rides/royal-ascot/royal-ascot-2019-ladies-day-15809\">Ladies\u2019 Day</a> priced at \u00a359.99 return.

The<a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-7079781/Epsom-officials-rule-moving-Derby-Wednesday-rival-sports-events.html\"> idea was dismissed by Epsom spokesman Jonno Spence</a>, who said: \u201cThe fact is that people cannot take the day off work anymore during the week and London would not stop and cease like it used to for a Wednesday Derby. It\u2019s just not going to happen and that was very clear in the numbers that were attending the Derby on a Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cVodafone, the sponsors at the time it was switched, were not interested in a Wednesday Derby. They wanted a Saturday Derby and it is one of the few races now with a solid backer in Investec, who started sponsoring in 2009 and currently have a deal until 2026. Competing for the leisure pound is now far more competitive and it is very competitive sporting wise on a Saturday. But, equally, we would not get the numbers going back to a midweek fixture that we do now.\u201d</p> <p>The idea has been mooted again this year because of the competing attraction of the Champions League Final involving two British sides and it\u2019s undoubtedly true that the game will have an impact. The firm <a href=\"https://bookmakers.tv/\">bookmakers.tv</a>, who monitor betting with all the major bookmakers, have crunched the numbers and report that Champions League is set to generate \u00a365m in wagers, up \u00a315m from previous years, followed by the Derby where \u00a335m is set to be bet with the Anthony Joshua fight not far behind at \u00a325m.</p> <p>Some are indicating that it\u2019s not as busy at Epsom today. We shall see when the attendance figures and estimates of the numbers on the Hill roll in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/geoffbanksbet/status/1134770256981962752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Derby day traffic as quiet as I&#39;ve ever seen it at 11:30 <a href=\"https://t.co/9SoiSvxjSd\">pic.twitter.com/9SoiSvxjSd</a></p>&mdash; Geoff Banks (@geoffbanksbet) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/geoffbanksbet/status/1134770256981962752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 1, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T11:55:51.031Z\">at 12.55pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf2601a8f082f7da1f2bdbe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T11:27:41.414Z\">12.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>What you want to know most of all it\u2019s what is going to win the Derby ... here\u2019s our tipster Chris Cook\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/30/the-derby-2019-horse-by-horse-guide-to-the-240th-epsom-classic?CMP=share_btn_tw\">horse-by-horse guide to the big-race runners</a> and his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/31/the-derby-dante-winner-telecaster-can-defy-draw-hoodoo-glory-horse-racing-tips\">in-depth analysis of all the races, including the Derby, on TV today</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d30b0e95a2dee475e4f2cd0a2dc14ac8d476d926\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d30b0e95a2dee475e4f2cd0a2dc14ac8d476d926/0_156_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The view across the Downs on Derby day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The view across the Downs on Derby day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf25eb18f082f7da1f2bdb9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T11:18:53.045Z\">12.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Our intrepid reporter Greg Wood is walking the track right now \u2013 and you can follow his progress <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Greg_Wood_/status/1134776544734384128\">via the Twittersphere</a>. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Greg_Wood_/status/1134776544734384128\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">It is wonderfully peaceful down at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Derby?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#Derby</a> start.

Casual sports fans who tune in to the action will do so very briefly, as an appetiser before the main course in Madrid. It\u2019s just the way it is.</p> <p>Driving towards the famous track just before 10 this morning, however, it was still possible to sense that something special will be happening on the Surrey downs this afternoon. The fun fair is already in full swing, long lines of cars and streams of people are heading towards the course and from early morning, racegoers had been arriving to pitch marquees around the far side of the track, where they will see only the opening exchanges of today\u2019s race.</p> <p>That doesn\u2019t matter, though. It\u2019s being here that counts, just as it has for nearly 250 years. Tens of thousands of people are converging on Epsom, just as they did in the days when the only way to get here was on horseback, or Shanks\u2019s Pony. And on a hot June afternoon like the one we have in prospect today, there really is no better place to be.</p> <p>They can all hope too that they will head home later having backed a winner at a working person\u2019s price. This is one of the more open renewals of the Derby in recent years, with no fewer than five of the 13 runners currently top-priced in single figures, while a couple more \u2013 including Circus Maximus, with yesterday\u2019s Oaks-winning jockey Frankie Dettori aboard \u2013 are around 12-1. Bearing in mind that we had a 40-1 winner just two years ago who was, like all of Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s seven-strong team, bred to improve significantly for today\u2019s test, it is difficult to rule out more than two or three with any confidence.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7095e9c2c4d1c6817482972620d72839bd26b1db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7095e9c2c4d1c6817482972620d72839bd26b1db/0_52_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Racegoers arrive at a baking hot Epsom for Derby day.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Racegoers arrive at a baking hot Epsom for Derby day.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Walton/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is also encouraging, given the doubts about both Sir Dragonet and Telecaster being supplemented just a fortnight or so ago, is that all of the major Derby trial winners will be in today\u2019s field. It is, after all, the race which was designed to find the colt with the ideal blend of speed, stamina, athleticism and courage to cope with this unique course and stamp himself as the leader of his generation and whichever of these horses is led into the winner\u2019s enclosure this evening will have earned that status.<br></p> <p>This will also be one of the hottest Derby afternoons for years, and the ground in the home straight is now officially good-to-firm, with the remainder of the track described as good. 3mm of water went onto the Derby course last night but that will scarcely account for the evaporation this morning and by the time of the big race at 4.30, it is fair to assume that it will be good-to-firm all over.<br></p> <p>My colleague Chris Cook <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/may/31/the-derby-dante-winner-telecaster-can-defy-draw-hoodoo-glory-horse-racing-tips\">has tipped</a> Telecaster for the Derby, and all the breaking news and results from the supporting races will be here as the day unfolds and one colt from a generation of many thousands stamps his name into history.</p> </div>   </div>",

Madhmoon put up a tremendous performance in second for veteran trainer Kevin Prendergast, with Anthony Van Dyck\u2019s stablemate Japan in third. Another Ballydoyle runner, Broome, was fourth. The triumph was a joint-record seventh in the premier Classic for O\u2019Brien. Heffernan said: \u201cI was following Ryan, who I thought was the biggest danger. It was a big ask for Sir Dragonet on his just his third run, but mine had danced every dance.\u201d PA Anthony Van Dyck creates history for trainer Aidan O\u2019Brien with his seventh winner, equalling the Derby record. We are still waiting for the full result ... 1 Anthony Van Dyck (J A Heffernan) 13-2 2 Madhmoon (C D Hayes) 10-1 3 Japan (W M Lordan) 20-1 13 ran And they\u2019re off ... Broome slow but Telecaster is out boldly ... in the early stages Sovereign leads from Norway and Telecaster ... Circus Maximus is prominent and Line Of Duty is fifth ... Broome is making a move out wide ... Madhmoon kicks for home ... Sir Dragonet goes for the line but Anthony Van Dyck wins on the inside with a late run. The runners are now behind the stalls and it won\u2019t be long now. A lot will depend on how Telecaster starts from stall two. It\u2019s a poor draw and he will need to get a clean break and be prominent early. We will soon see ... This just in ... from paddock side ... \u2018Telecaster, the second favorite for the Derby, was a little on his toes before the Dante Stakes at York earlier this month, but Hughie Morrison had fitted him with ear plugs in the preliminaries today and so far at least, they seem to be working. Telecaster looked very relaxed in the paddock despite the warm temperatures, as did most of the runners. Norway, who was slightly on his toes, was the only slight negative I could see.\u2019 This was my each-way choice If you\u2019re backing Telecaster you\u2019ll be very interested to know that the horse is wearing earplugs today. There had been plenty of talk about this but an eagle-eyed paddock watcher has just confirmed it is the case. The horse got worked up at York before winning the Dante so connections are trying to ensure he stays calm. Telecaster is the Guardian tip ... he looks well for sure. It\u2019s almost like being there. The parade ring ahead of the Derby is one of the best places to be in racing. The anticipation, the atmosphere, the colours ... oh and the horses. Emma Berry is helping us out with a glimpse of five of the seven Aidan O\u2019Brien horses... 11-4 Sir Dragonet 5-1 Telecaster 6-1 Broome 8-1 Anthony Van Dyck 9-1 Bangkok 9-1 Madhmoon 10-1 Circus Maximus 22-1 Japan 33-1 Norway 33-1 Line of Duty 100-1 Sovereign 250-1 Hiroshima Full betting changes here Having coughed up \u00a385,000 for a place in the Derby, connections of Telecaster (4.30) were surely hoping for better accommodation than stall two, from which no Derby winner has emerged since starting stalls were introduced half a century ago. But that may prove only an inconvenience on his way to proving himself the best of these colts. While his background is not that of a conventional Derby winner, from a stable that rarely competes at the highest level and unraced until March, his performance in winning the Dante was thoroughly convincing. He broke alertly, ran fast enough to secure a handy position and then settled before finishing more strongly than a classy rival in Too Darn Hot. He will have to follow a very similar pattern and his draw is no help but at least the likely pace-setter, Sovereign, is only two stalls away in four. If Telecaster can latch on to his tail for the first furlong, the early part of the race may work out quite well for him. Telecaster\u2019s sire is New Approach, another free-going sort who nonetheless had the stamina to win a Derby, and his dam was also comfortable at this distance. While he has had plenty of racing in a short time, the signs show he is thriving on it and he is surprisingly backable at 5-1. Sir Dragonet has a better draw but has been a slow starter so far and may not make best use of it. This fast ground is a question mark for him. From the same stable, Anthony Van Dyck is more of a worry, as an experienced colt who impressed at Lingfield. Circus Maximus is also going the right way and Frankie Dettori could help him hit the frame. Broome and Bangkok are both professional types and unbeaten this year but they have not yet shown the necessary quality. Japan and Line Of Duty were well beaten in the Dante and may struggle to turn that form around just a fortnight later. There\u2019s been a bit of chat in the press room and online to the effect that connections of Sir Dragonet might withdraw the Derby favourite over concerns that today\u2019s ground could be uncomfortably fast for him. But these rumours have proved to be nothing more than what Damon Runyon would call phonus balonus. I have just witnessed the Ballydoyle huddle in the weighing room and there were the expected seven jockeys grouped around Aidan O\u2019Brien for the master trainer\u2019s pre-Derby briefing, just before jocks went out to ride in the Dash. Aidan spent three or four minutes addressing the group, then six of them wandered back into the changing room while the trainer spent another two minutes talking to Ryan Moore. Evidently Aidan managed to set his jockey at his ease, as Ryan had a good laugh at something that was said. Maybe O\u2019Brien told him about those rumours ... 1 Ornate (Phil Dennis) 33-1 2 Dark Shot (P Mathers) 14-1 3 Blue De Vega (M Dwyer) 25-1 4 Eeh Bah Gum (Jamie Gormley) 9-1 19 ran Also: 7-2 Fav Hathiq Non Runner: 2 And they\u2019re off ... Just Glamorous quickly away ... Ornate now leads ... and held all challengers, including Dark Shot and Blue De Vega. Back to the picture desk selections from the Derbys of the past and this is one of the best finds. When the lampshade hats first appeared on the fashion catwalk in the early 90s I did opine that this was the last thing we would ever see on the street. But they did appear at race meetings \u2013 at Royal Ascot, and at Epsom, including here at the 1991 Derby. 7-2 Hathiq 15-2 Muthmir 8-1 Duke Of Firenze 9-1 Copper Knight 10-1 Eeh Bah Gum Full odds here Richard Hannon celebrated his 1,000th career winner after Anna Nerium came from last to first to go one place better than 12 months ago in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes at Epsom. Having found only Awesometank too strong last time out, the Dubawi filly turned the tables on her most recent conqueror to claim the third Group Three victory of her career in the extended mile prize. Anchored at the rear of the field earl on, the 9-2 shot swooped down the outside of her rivals before moving past eventual runner-up Awesometank inside the final furlong, going on to score by a length and a quarter. Hannon said: \u201cIt is lovely to get the milestone in a significant race - 1,000 winners is a lot of winners. She is a very good filly and was unlucky in this last year. I thought when they went very quick, \u2018lovely\u2019, as she was very unlucky in this race last year. There is a perception she has to have soft ground to win, but she doesn\u2019t need it. She can do it on this ground. I\u2019m not sure she loved the track, but she dealt with it. \u201cWe will sit and talk to [the owner] and see what she wants to do, but you would like to think she could go close in a Rothschild, where they might get soft ground. Ascot is not out of the question yet.\u201d PA Caspian Prince is trying to win the Dash for the fourth time and for a fourth different trainer, though it could be that his draw in stall 10 is no help, as it has seemed preferable to be drawn to one side or the other. Duke Of Firenze, another 10-year-old, comes here in fine form and has an excellent draw in 19. But it will be hard for them all to hold off Hathiq, who carries just a 4lb penalty for his Curragh success on Sunday. Very lightly raced until this year, this half-brother to a Guineas runner-up is now making hay from his low rating. 1 Zaaki (R L Moore) 11-8 Fav 2 Oh This Is Us (Tom Marquand) 8-1 3 Chief Ironside (Jason Watson) 16-1 6 ran And they\u2019re off ... Zaaki slowly away and Bye Bye Hong Kong has an early lead ... Chief Ironside and Mordin are close behind ... On the turn for home and Chief Ironside takes the lead ... Zaaki and Oh This Is Us come late with Zaaki quickening up the best to win. Legend has it that gypsy fortune-tellers write the name of their prediction for Derby success in chalk on a wishing well outside the Amato pub in Epsom before the iconic race. It could be another good omen for the Balding team, as this year\u2019s selection is Bangkok. PA 13-8 Zaaki 15-8 Bye Bye Hong Kong 5-1 Mordin Full betting here. This Diomed Stakes could provide an early thrill for the King Power connections, to be represented by Bangkok in the big race. They have the improving Bye Bye Hong Kong in this with an obvious chance, getting the weight-for-age allowance from all his rivals. He was convincing against Oh This Is Us at Windsor last time and his front-running style may play better here than Zaaki\u2019s strong finishing. 1 Anna Nerium (Tom Marquand) 9-2 2 Awesometank (James Doyle) 3-1 3 Veracious (R L Moore) 2-1 Fav 8 ran And they\u2019re off ... Akvavera has an early lead ... Awesometank and Nyaleti are close up ... Anna Nerium is last ... The leader kicks for home ... Awesometank takes it up but Anna Nerium from last and challenging hard ... and gets there. 5-2 Veracious 7-2 Awesometank 5-1 Anna Nerium Full betting here 1 Le Don De Vie (M Dwyer) 5-1 2 The Trader (S De Sousa) 7-2 Fav 3 Alkaamel (C D Hayes) 6-1 9 ran My colleague Greg Wood reports that the going is now \u2018Good to Firm\u2019 all round. This Racenews report reveals how Old Stone Face still doesn\u2019t give much away \u2013 look at his tips at the end of the item! The statue is actuall a good likeness methinks. \u2018The Queen was at Epsom for all nine of Lester Piggott\u2019s Derby victories, and in 1957 he rode her own Carrozza to Oaks success. The statue, located by the winners\u2019 enclosure, met with Piggott\u2019s approval. \u201dI think it has been a great idea, it\u2019s marvellous, I am honoured,\u201d said Piggott, whose family and friends were all on hand to watch the occasion. \u201cI had seen the statue before today and it is very good. The Queen also seems in great form.\u201d In today\u2019s Derby, Piggott has gone for the Aidan O\u2019Brien-trained pair of Broome and Sir Dragonet.\u2019 The key bit of form here looks like being a Listed contest at Goodwood four weeks ago, in which Awesometank held on by a head from the strong-finishing Anna Nerium. It\u2019s tempting to give the runner-up a chance to turn that around over this slightly longer trip but Awesometank is a very likeable filly with a high strike-rate who may be sharper again for that seasonal reappearance. The fitting of cheekpieces will not hurt and nor will James Doyle\u2019s presence in the saddle. Veracious beat the selection last year but disappointed last month and the fitting of a tongue tie is disconcerting. Andrew Balding, trainer of leading Derby hope Bangkok, got his day off to a cracking start as Le Don De Vie won the opening Investec Private Banking Handicap. The 5-1 shot was partnered by Martin Dwyer, who rode Sir Percy to win the Derby in 2006. He told ITV Racing: \u201cThere\u2019s no better place to be in the world than Epsom on Derby day. It\u2019s quick and it\u2019s nice (ground) - there\u2019s no jar.\u201d PA And they\u2019re off ... Nayef Road is pushed along early and Le Don De Vie leads after a furlong ... with Nayef Road pulling hard ... Alkaamel is last on the way to Tattenham Corner ... The Trader closes and makes his move ... The Trader is challenging the long-time leader ... but Le Don De Vie has gone clear for an easy win. While the eyes of most in racing are on Epsom, some bookies may have just lost a few quid on the opener at Musselburgh. The John Ryan-trained Bill Neigh won cosily at odds of 7-1, down from the 20-1 on offer when betting began. The trainer\u2019s record with two-year-old newcomers was 2/71 over the past nine years but the market\u2019s confidence in this one was not misplaced. Intriguingly, Ryan and the owner Gerry McGladery had four other entrants at Musselburgh today, though two became non-runners last night. They still have Battle Of Waterloo (2.50) and Needs To Be Seen (5.30). Battle Of Waterloo\u2019s price dropped from 14-1 all the way down to 4-1 with one firm but he is now back out to a general 10-1. Needs To Be Seen has been steady at about 6-1. Ryan has the rank outsider, Hiroshima, in today\u2019s Derby. The colt appears to be attracting no interest at 300-1. The going has changed to Good to Firm on the straight five-furlong course and Good on the Derby course following a dry night and three millimetres of watering. Andrew Cooper, clerk of the course at Epsom Downs, said at 11.30am after walking the courses twice this morning: \u201cIt is Good ground from the mile and a half start to the bottom of the hill, while it is on the faster side of good up the home straight. I would say the top side of the home straight is Good to Firm. The temperature is about 23 degrees Celsius now and it is going to get hotter - up to 26 or 27 degrees Celsius. The courses will dry, as was shown yesterday on a much cooler and less sunny day. \u201cI am thinking that by the time the Investec Derby is off at 4.30pm, I am anticipating Good to Firm ground, but hopefully a decent, safe Good to Firm. We will update with any changes to the official going descriptions through the afternoon. \u201cI walked much of the course yesterday evening after racing and it was almost Good to Firm. The question was then how much water do we put on rather than do we water. We put on three millimetres from the mile and a half start to the six-furlong pole; left the next two furlongs, which is down the hill into the home straight which had been watered earlier in the week and we put three millimetres on the home straight down to the crossing on the pulling up area just by the Rubbing House pub. \u201cWe started watering about 6.30pm yesterday and the team finished around 12.30am. Those same guys were in about 4.30am this morning. It is great credit and thanks to them. There were four guys involved in the watering - the two main ones were Craig Williamson, who is the Regional Estates Manager, and Chris Youngs, the Deputy Estates Manager, who is based here at Epsom all the time. We have six full-time groundstaff.\u201d 3-1 The Trader 11-2 Politicise 11-2 Nayef Road 6-1 Le Don De Vie Full prices here. Just a few miles from the Epsom hury burly, Kieran Shoemark will make a low-key return to action tonight in a \u00a33,000 maiden race at Lingfield. The jockey has served a six-month ban for a cocaine positive and spoke impressively, a couple of months ago, about his efforts to leave his addiction behind. I wish him well for his comeback aboard Heroic in the 8.15pm race, in which his mount is expected to start favourite. A quality juvenile last year, Victory Command was repeatedly disappointing this season until his staying-on third place in the Silver Bowl last weekend. Mark Johnston\u2019s colt looks ready for this step up in distance and is now quite attractively weighted, down 10lb from his peak rating. Did you travel by train to the Derby today? I have numerous times and, you won\u2019t be surprised to hear given the mess on Network Rail this week, there have been issues. If you\u2019re travelling to Royal Ascot later this month you\u2019ll already know that there is a rail strike planned for that week. Help isat hand. Zeelo, the on-demand coach service, are running a fleet to the track each day. Tickets are sent straight to user\u2019s phones and passengers will travel in an executive coach with leather seats, tables, WiFi and toilets. They can also enjoy prosecco on arrival and a selection of breakfast nibbles on board. Tickets for each day are available via the website: return travel starts from just \u00a339.99 for the Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday meets. Saturday\u2019s meet is \u00a349.99 return, with Ladies\u2019 Day priced at \u00a359.99 return. Sounds good value to me and you can click here to find out more. And if you use the code \u2018Ascot\u2019 that gives 85% off each of the journeys \u2013 so Ladies\u2019 Day from London drops from \u00a359.99 down to just \u00a39 return, etc. And no I\u2019m not getting a backhander. I just hate travelling by train to that meeting and think others ought to know about the alternatives. It may be an open Derby but the main newspaper tipsters can\u2019t see past the top three in the betting, according to the selection box in the Racing Post which records the collective wisdom of Fleet Street\u2019s racing folk. Seven of the 14 tipsters listed are convinced by the favourite, Sir Dragonet. The others are split between Broome (4) and Telecaster (3). Even so, Broome is a little weak in the market and is now widely available at 6-1, having been 5s this morning. The main mover so far has been Madhmoon, who was 11-1 overnight but is generally 8-1, with only shards of 9-1 remaining. Longshot punters appear to be showing interest in John Gosden\u2019s lightly raced Humanitarian, down to 50-1 with most firms, though 66s remains in a place. Oli Bell of ITV fame tells me he fancies it, but denies having been tipped the wink by anyone in the yard; this is the fruit of hours of form study, I\u2019m assured. The picture desk has been busy finding the best Derby shots of yesteryear, when the race was run on a Wednesday, and I\u2019ll be posting some throughout the day. Prince Monolulu (real name Peter Carl Mackay) is the first. Here\u2019s how Wiki reports his death: \u2018The biography of Jeffrey Bernard by Graham Lord relates Prince Monolulu\u2019s death in some detail. It describes how Bernard at the time was working as a horse-racing journalist and visited Monolulu in the Middlesex Hospital to interview him. Bernard had brought with him a box of Black Magic chocolates and offered Monolulu a \u201cstrawberry cream\u201d. Monolulu subsequently choked to death on it and Bernard bade him farewell.\u2019 The Queen has arrived at Epsom and she is unveiling a statue of the great Lester Piggott today who has been so central to Derby folklore. Mirror racing correspondent David Yates just raised the issue again on Racing TV but the suggestion made in some quarters this week about switching the Derby back to a Wednesday (I was there for the last midweek running in 1994 when Erhaab won) is surely a non-starter. The idea was dismissed by Epsom spokesman Jonno Spence, who said: \u201cThe fact is that people cannot take the day off work anymore during the week and London would not stop and cease like it used to for a Wednesday Derby. It\u2019s just not going to happen and that was very clear in the numbers that were attending the Derby on a Wednesday. \u201cVodafone, the sponsors at the time it was switched, were not interested in a Wednesday Derby. They wanted a Saturday Derby and it is one of the few races now with a solid backer in Investec, who started sponsoring in 2009 and currently have a deal until 2026. Competing for the leisure pound is now far more competitive and it is very competitive sporting wise on a Saturday. But, equally, we would not get the numbers going back to a midweek fixture that we do now.\u201d The idea has been mooted again this year because of the competing attraction of the Champions League Final involving two British sides and it\u2019s undoubtedly true that the game will have an impact. The firm bookmakers.tv, who monitor betting with all the major bookmakers, have crunched the numbers and report that Champions League is set to generate \u00a365m in wagers, up \u00a315m from previous years, followed by the Derby where \u00a335m is set to be bet with the Anthony Joshua fight not far behind at \u00a325m. Some are indicating that it\u2019s not as busy at Epsom today. We shall see when the attendance figures and estimates of the numbers on the Hill roll in. What you want to know most of all it\u2019s what is going to win the Derby ... here\u2019s our tipster Chris Cook\u2019s horse-by-horse guide to the big-race runners and his in-depth analysis of all the races, including the Derby, on TV today. Our intrepid reporter Greg Wood is walking the track right now \u2013 and you can follow his progress via the Twittersphere. If we are being honest with ourselves, today\u2019s Investec Derby at Epsom is not even the biggest sporting fixture in the four-hour period between four o\u2019clock and eight. Casual sports fans who tune in to the action will do so very briefly, as an appetiser before the main course in Madrid. It\u2019s just the way it is. Driving towards the famous track just before 10 this morning, however, it was still possible to sense that something special will be happening on the Surrey downs this afternoon. The fun fair is already in full swing, long lines of cars and streams of people are heading towards the course and from early morning, racegoers had been arriving to pitch marquees around the far side of the track, where they will see only the opening exchanges of today\u2019s race. That doesn\u2019t matter, though. It\u2019s being here that counts, just as it has for nearly 250 years. Tens of thousands of people are converging on Epsom, just as they did in the days when the only way to get here was on horseback, or Shanks\u2019s Pony. And on a hot June afternoon like the one we have in prospect today, there really is no better place to be. They can all hope too that they will head home later having backed a winner at a working person\u2019s price. This is one of the more open renewals of the Derby in recent years, with no fewer than five of the 13 runners currently top-priced in single figures, while a couple more \u2013 including Circus Maximus, with yesterday\u2019s Oaks-winning jockey Frankie Dettori aboard \u2013 are around 12-1. Bearing in mind that we had a 40-1 winner just two years ago who was, like all of Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s seven-strong team, bred to improve significantly for today\u2019s test, it is difficult to rule out more than two or three with any confidence. What is also encouraging, given the doubts about both Sir Dragonet and Telecaster being supplemented just a fortnight or so ago, is that all of the major Derby trial winners will be in today\u2019s field. It is, after all, the race which was designed to find the colt with the ideal blend of speed, stamina, athleticism and courage to cope with this unique course and stamp himself as the leader of his generation and whichever of these horses is led into the winner\u2019s enclosure this evening will have earned that status. This will also be one of the hottest Derby afternoons for years, and the ground in the home straight is now officially good-to-firm, with the remainder of the track described as good. 3mm of water went onto the Derby course last night but that will scarcely account for the evaporation this morning and by the time of the big race at 4.30, it is fair to assume that it will be good-to-firm all over. My colleague Chris Cook has tipped Telecaster for the Derby, and all the breaking news and results from the supporting races will be here as the day unfolds and one colt from a generation of many thousands stamps his name into history.",

      "bodyText": "A former Conservative minister who resigned over the government\u2019s handling of Brexit has lost a vote of no confidence in him by his local association, after he was outspoken in his support for a vote on the final deal. Phillip Lee, MP for Bracknell in Berkshire, said he recognised that a majority of his Conservative association\u2019s members opposed his view on Brexit, but argued he was elected to represent the best interests of everyone in his constituency. Lee supported remain in the EU referendum and was the first government minister to resign over Brexit. Bracknell Forest \u2013 an area including the towns of Bracknell, Sandhurst and Crowthorne \u2013 voted to leave the EU in 2016, with 53.9% of voters in favour of exiting the bloc. \u201cI have never been in any doubt that a majority of my Conservative association\u2019s membership have opposed my view on Brexit, mostly at the same time as agreeing with me that the government\u2019s withdrawal agreement would be bad for our country and should be rejected \u2013 as I have repeatedly done in parliament,\u201d the former justice minister wrote on his website. \u201cHowever, as a Member of Parliament, I do not represent only the views of Conservative association members. I do not even represent only the views of Conservative voters. \u201cRather, I am elected to represent the best interests of everyone in the Bracknell constituency \u2013 young and old, of every political persuasion and none and including those of future generations who are still too young to vote.\u201d He added that he would not be \u201cforced into taking a decision\u201d on his future by an \u201corchestrated, destructive campaign from outside the party\u201d. Bracknell Conservative Association called the vote after 53 members signed a petition. The association chair, Gerry Barber, told the BBC: \u201cThe result of the vote was that a majority of members present were in agreement with the motion, which was therefore passed, and the result has been communicated to Dr Lee and to the full membership. I will be discussing the meeting with Phillip later this week.\u201d",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/joyce-carol-oates\" title=\"\">Joyce Carol Oates</a> was born in New York in 1938 and has published more than 100 books including novels, plays, short stories, poetry, and nonfiction. She has won many awards, including the National Book award, two O Henry awards, the National Humanities Medal and the Jerusalem prize (2019). Oates has taught at Princeton University since 1978. Her new novel, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/my-life-as-a-rat-9780008339647.html\" title=\"\"><em>My Life As a Rat</em></a><em>,</em> explores \u2013 through the story of an adolescent girl, Violet \u2013 themes that permeate her writing, including social, racial and gender equality.</p> <p><strong>You write in the acknowledg</strong><strong>ments that </strong><strong><em>My Life As a Rat</em> appeared in its earliest form as a short story titled Curly Red in <em>Harper\u2019s</em> magazine in 2003, reprinted in the anthology <em>I Am No One You Know</em></strong><strong> in 2004. Why did you decide to develop it into a novel?</strong><br>I had long meditated upon the life of a girl who had impulsively blurted out the truth under duress, within a few seconds assuring that her clannish family will reject her and that she will become an \u201corphan\u201d; she will spend much of her life trying to return to her family, hoping to ingratiate herself with them. Over the years I\u2019d accumulated many notes and scenes, and I had always known how Violet\u2019s story would develop.</p> <p><strong>Many of your novels explore family conflict \u2013 this new one probes the tension between family loyalty and independence...</strong><br>It does seem that the classic family unit is predominant in our lives, and that it is difficult, particularly for a young person, and perhaps for a girl, to break free of the spell of familial love \u2013 which can be possessive and stultifying as well as nourishing and enlivening. I have dedicated the novel to my friend of many years Elaine Showalter, who\u2019d been disowned by her family when she married \u201coutside her faith\u201d. (This is simplifying a complex situation, but essentially that was the reason.) We are all bound to our families and it is a sort of fairytale nightmare if one might be disowned or rejected.</p> <p><strong>In the novel, </strong><strong>Violet speaks out about a crime \u2013 the racially motivated assault of a high-school student. You have previously said novels of yours</strong><strong> grew out of living in Detroit during racial tensions. Did that influence this novel?</strong><br>Yes, <em>My Life As a Rat</em> takes place in an urban area similar to Detroit, but also to many post-industrial cities in the US where racism is long entrenched, rarely challenged in the system, and only comes to the attention of a wider world when there are outbursts of what is called \u2013 diplomatically \u2013 \u201curban unrest\u201d (more crudely, and misleadingly, these incidents are often called \u201crace riots\u201d \u2013 an insidious way of blaming victims when they rebel against their oppression).</p> <p><strong>Did you want to show the importance of speaking out against injustice despite the consequences? I thought that was powerfully portrayed.</strong><br>Yes, I think we must do this. I was struck years ago when the brother of the Unabomber cooperated with the FBI to identify his serial-killer brother, Ted Kaczynski \u2013 a courageous act \u2013 but was denounced in some quarters as a \u201crat\u201d, as if family loyalty to a murderer was more important than saving the lives of victims to be! There must be civil and moral laws higher than the tribalism of the family, the clan, and the political party. Civilisation collapses when we don\u2019t apply justice unilaterally. The US is undergoing this sort of slow collapse of ethics and civil law under the Trump administration, which prosecutes and pardons indiscriminately, depending upon political loyalties. It\u2019s very destructive, particularly for younger generations, to observe adults behaving in ways that are unethical or criminal.</p> <p><strong>You have written an essay entitled Why Is Your Writing So Violent? about being asked </strong><strong>that question reproachfully\u2026</strong><br>Probably this issue is not so relevant now, but there seemed to be a general consensus, even among writers, that female writers should focus upon domestic life, family life, childbirth, raising children, marriages, romance\u2026 I can\u2019t tell you how many reviewers, among them women, chided me repeatedly for daring to write about quite different subjects. One reviewer, for the now-defunct <em>Saturday Review</em>, quite an influential magazine in the 1960s, bluntly told me to focus on women\u2019s issues and leave the \u201cbig, social novel\u201d to Norman Mailer.</p> <p><strong>You have described the \u201cdaily scramble for existence\u201d of your working-class upbringing</strong><strong>. Did you draw on it</strong><strong> as Violet strives to survive?</strong><br>Yes, Violet is directly a child of that \u201cdaily scramble\u201d. Her father is very like my own father, Frederic Oates, who always had second jobs in order to support our family. I did not have six siblings \u2013 only two \u2013 but I grew up in a Catholic milieu in which large families were commonplace and a father working very hard, and a mother at home, also commonplace.</p> <p><strong>Violet is violated in different ways, including physical and sexual abuse</strong><strong>, but ultimately survives and even in some ways thrives. Did you purposefully show hope?</strong><br>Most people have reserves of stamina, stoicism, energy and hope that are not greatly tested in the course of their lives. I do believe that a young woman like Violet would survive her difficulties and eventually define herself as independent of the opinions of her bigoted family members. She would find a way to establish relationships and eventually to love another person who was worthy of her love. I believe in particular destinies \u2013 people who are \u201cmade for each other\u201d and only have to discover each other. There have been happy resolutions in my life, numberless times, and so I don\u2019t feel that I am forcing a positive ending.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One reviewer told me to leave the \u2018big, social novel\u2019 to Norman Mailer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You are noted for being</strong><strong> prolific.

You should not decide something with a 51.9% vote. In California, referendum with heavy fiscal consequences require 60 to 66% of voters. Why did Britain, the leading democracy, not look to other countries for models on how to hold a referendum?\u201d The possibility of a second referendum, he said, provided the UK with an opportunity to look abroad for examples of less divisive public votes. \u201cBut I hesitate to rub into Britain not using other countries as models, because my own country, the United States, is perhaps the worst democracy in the modern world for refusing to look to other countries for models. Don\u2019t make our mistake please.\u201d Asked what advice he would give if he was a therapist faced with Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn as clients, he said: \u201cYou are not going to like this advice, but I\u2019d say resign and make way for better leaders.\u201d",

It went on from morning till night.</p> <p><strong>Vital part</strong></p> <p>I asked Clay whether he would still behave the same way if he won the world title, a development that would enable him to earn the biggest money without bothering to be boastful. He said he would because people expected it and the papers wouldn\u2019t let him stop. Then he seemed to admit that all this \u2013 and even the great convincing motive of commercialism \u2013 did not add up to an adequate explanation of his public character.

      "bodyText": "Paul Rees is at Twickenham for the Guardian and sent this take on a massively entertaining rugby at the final whistle. Saracens receive the cup. For the fifth time in eight seasons, Saracens collect the Gallagher Premiership cup to add to their European Champions Cup. Brad Barritt takes possession of the trophy and raises it to the sky with the assistance of Owen Farrell. Exeter Chiefs receive their runners-up medals: They\u2019ve made a massive contribution to an astonishingly good final, but there had to be a loser and they\u2019ve lost yet again against what is arguably the best club team in English rugby history. Jack Yeandle speaks: \u201cI\u2019m gonna say it\u2019s a little bit more painful than last year because for a lot of that game we were in charge and really had our tails up,\u201d he tells BT Sport. Asked if he thought the Chiefs had the game won after an hour, when they went 11 points in front, he replies: \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, yes, especially with the boys we had on the bench.\u201d Clearly emotional, he struggles to hold back the tears. \u201cWe just need to keep up our levels of belief and keep the hunger,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m immensely proud of the boys and everything we\u2019ve done, but we\u2019ve just slipped up at the final hurdle today.\u201d Maro Itoje speaks: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to put into words,\u201d he tells BT Sport. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working towards this all year so big credit to all the players and all the staff. Fair play to Exeter they\u2019re a top, top side. They\u2019re by far and away the second best team in this competition. We have some fantastic leaders in this team. That game was all about character. We didn\u2019t play well for large parts of that game, but luckily we had time to rescue it.\u201d Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeep! It\u2019s all over and Saracens have somehow found a way to win this Premiership final. They looked beaten when Henry Slade put the Chiefs nine points ahead just before the hour, but a rousing pep-talk from Owen Farrell prompted them to score 21 points without reply in 16 minutes. It was an epic game of rugby, so hats off to Exeter, who more than played their part. From a line-out, Sam Hill reacts quickest and crashes over the line for a Chiefs try that is converted. It\u2019s too little too late, however, as the conversion is the last kick of the game. 79 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-37 Saracens Apologies for the minor confusion in that previous entry. The gap is 10 points with less than two minutes remaining and Exeter are set to lose yet another final to a team who looked beaten around the hour mark. In the BT Sport commentary box, Austin Healy awards Maro Itoje his man of the match award. He\u2019s played well, but given away a lot of penalties and spent 10 minutes in the sin bin. 77 min: From the line-out, Saracens drive for the Chiefs line and Jamie George goes over to touch the ball down under the posts for his second try of the game. Farrell doesn\u2019t miss this one. 76 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-30 Saracens From the kick-off, Maro Itoje does brilliantly to win the ball back from the Chiefs, before a wonderful Farrell kick to the corner pins Exeter back on their own line. 74 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-30 Saracens Saracens win a penalty as Chiefs collapse a scrum about 30 metres from goal. Owen Farrell steps up for a kick you\u2019d put your house on him making in his sleep and ... pulls the ball wide of the left upright. Crikey! 71 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-30 Saracens Another box-kick from Nic White on the edge of the Exeter 22. A promising move up the field breaks down when No8 Matt Kvesic takes his eye off an incoming pass and drops the ball. 70 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-30 Saracens Chiefs full-back Jack Nowell hobbles off under his own steam, but we won\u2019t be seeing him again. He\u2019s had a good game and is replaced by Gareth Steenson, who comes in at No10. Henry Slade moves to full-back and Joe Simmonds moves into the centre, presumably. 70 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-30 Saracens It\u2019s worth noting that when Saracens went 27-16 ahead, Owen Farrell gave his Saracens team-mates an absolute rocket as he screamed and shouted at them in a huddle under the posts. Their response has been nothing if not emphatic. There\u2019s a break in play as Jack Nowell receives treatment for what looks like a nasty leg injury. He shipped a tackle while in possession and his leg twisted badly as he went to ground. 67 min: Richard Wigglesworth finds a hole in the Chiefs defence and burst forward from the halfway line. He offloads to Alex Hale and from the subsequent breakdown, Hale whips the ball to his left and suddenly Saracens have a massive overlap. The ball goes through assorted pairs of hands with lightning speed, finding its way to Alex Lozowski, who cuts inside his man and goes over in the corner. Andy Farrell makes no mistake with the conversion. 65 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-23 Saracens Saracens have the ball, but kick it high to test Joe Simmonds again. He catches once again, but Saracens turn over possession. 63 min: Exeter Chiefs 27-23 Saracens Nic White leaves the ball hanging with a high kick from halfway. Owen Farrell spots some space in behind Simmonds but is unable to find touch as the territorial battle continues. A fantastic cross-field kick from Owen Farrell catches out Joe Simmonds, who is backpedalling and misjudges the flight of the ball. Liam Williams leaps to catch the ball and goes over in the corner, with Simmonds powerless to stop him. Owen Farrell adds the precious extras. Exeter make their way from one side of the pitch to the other with a lovely ball over the top and a brilliant offload from Sam Skinner to Henry Slade enables the Chiefs centre to go over in the corner, the ball in the hand of one outstretched arm. That\u2019s a wonderful try, but Saracens attempts to defend it were very casual. Joe Simmonds misses with his conversion attempt. 57 min: Exeter 25-16 Saracens Mario Itoje is not having one of his better games and concedes another penalty for lying on the ball. Chiefs kick for touch, win the subsequent line-out and make ground towards the Saracens 22. 55 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens There\u2019s a break in play as Saracens wing-forward Jackson Wray receives medical attention. He\u2019s fit to continue and it\u2019s a scrum to Sarries on the halfway line. 53 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Alex Goode has a kick blocked and one of his team-mates boots the ball over the Saracens try-line. Alex Lowzowski wins the foot-race to get the touchdown. It was close and he was quite casual, but the TMO confirms it is no try. 50 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Nic White clears the danger for Exeter again, but only as far as their own 22. He appears to injure his calf while kicking and requires treatment. He\u2019s going to soldier on, but it looks like a muscle injury that he\u2019ll be unable to run off. In the meantime, Mick Rhodes comes on for Sarries, while Sam Skinner replaces Jonny Hill in the Exeter ranks. 48 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Saracens are in possession on the Chiefs\u2019 22. Nic White repels them with a bruising tackle. Farrell plays the ball out wide to Tompkins, but his offload to Williams goes into touch with the winger under pressure from Chiefs full-back Jack Nowell. 47 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Luke Cowan-Dickie, Alec Hepburn and Tomas Francis come on for the chiefs, as Rob Baxter rings the changes. 45 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens More sloppy play from a tired and error-prone looking Saracens side, as Vincent Koch passes the ball straight to somebody in a black shirt. With his team under pressure pinned back on their line, scrum-half Nic White helps Exeter clear their lines with a fine kick for touch. 43 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Another error from Saracens, with Itoje grappling for the ball in a ruck while lying on the ground. Exeter kick for the corner, but don\u2019t quite make it. George Kruis steals possession back for Saracens at the ensuing line-out. They\u2019ve dodged a bullet, there. 42 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Saracens get the put-in at the restart as they were in possession of the ball when the referee stopped play. Richard Wigglesworth picks the ball out of the scrum and sets off on a darting run, only to drop the ball. Exeter have possession. 41 min: Exeter Chiefs 22-16 Saracens Saracens scrum-half Ben Spencer goes down injured after getting clattered by the hip of his team-mate Liam Williams, while the pair went for the same high ball. He\u2019s taken a bang on the head there and has to go off for a HIA and the mandatory 10 minutes R&amp;R that come with it. Richard Wigglesworth replaces him. Saracens kick off, with Nick Tompkins on for Brad Barritt, who was a doubt for this match with a hamstring injury, but managed to play the first half. The Chiefs are unchanged. A frenetic first half draws to a close and Exeter Chiefs go in for the break with the advantage. It\u2019s been a fantastically entertaining and eventful game of rugby so far, with both sides roaring out of the traps from the gun. 40+1 min: Exeter win a penalty under the posts as Saracens collapse the scrum. Uncharacteristically, because the clock is in the red zone they kick and take the three points. It\u2019s half time. 40 min: Exeter Chiefs 19-16 Saracens Alex Goode prevents Dave Ewars from going over, going down under the Exeter wing-forward as he goes over so he can\u2019t ground the ball. Exeter win a five-metre scrum as the first half clock ticks into the red zone. 38 min: Exeter Chiefs 19-16 Saracens Chiefs attack on the edge of the Saracens 22, with Vunipola and Skelton putting in big tackles to repel them. Ollie Devoto makes five metres with a powerful surge as Exeter go in search of their fourth try. They\u2019re a metre from the line, burrowing busily and Jack Nowell looks to have gone over, but is caught just short. 35 min: Exeter prop Ben Moon is penalised for not releasing the ball in the tackle, giving Saracens a penalty that is range for Owen Farrell. He slots it over and Dan Armand returns from his HIA. Sam Skinner makes way. With a forlorn Mario Itoje marooned on the touchline waiting for a break in play following the end of his 10-minute suspension, Exeter go over again. Jack Yeandle picks and runs, drawing two defenders. The ball is offloaded to Jonny Hill, who goes over from a metre out despite the close attention of two Saracens tacklers in Billy Vunipola and Jamie George. Joe Simmonds is unsuccessful with his conversion attempt. 28 min: Exeter Chiefs 14-13 Saracens Exeter go through phase after phase as they advance into the Saracens 22, while Mario Itoje is made to wait before returning to action following his spell on the Naughty Step. Not for the first time in this game, Chiefs are camped on the Saracens line. 26 min: Exeter Chiefs 14-13 Saracens Exeter No7 Dan Armand walks off with a head injury and looks to be heading for an assessment from the doctor. Sam Skinner replaces him and his side immediately get a penalty advantage as they play the ball hither and yon across the pitch looking for an opening. Liam Williams steals the ball from Exeter second row Dave Dennis out by the touchline, but immediately puts his foot in touch and Exeter have a line-out. 23 min: Exeter Chiefs 14-13 Saracens Speaking to BT Sport from his vantage point in the stands, Exeter director of rugby Rob Baxter has this to say. \u201cOnce they\u2019re getting on the front against us, it\u2019s like a rollercoaster that takes some stopping,\u201d he admits. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work extremely hard in defence. There\u2019s a few things we can do. We\u2019ve got a couple of guys out there who can settle down a bit and actually think their way through the game a little bit better. I\u2019m not completely concerned but we\u2019ve got our work cut out.\u201d Exeter wing-forward Dave Ewers finally drives low and hard over the line from one meter out after a lengthy siege on the Saracens line. Joe Simmonds adds the two extra points with a good boot from the touchline. 19 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-13 Saracens It\u2019s carry, after carry after carry from Exeter as they attempt to make that final yard over the line. Mario Itoje is over-exuberant in his efforts to repel them and is sent to the bin for \u2013 I think \u2013 being serially offside. Exeter kick for the corner again. With Henry Slade back on the pitch for Exeter, now it\u2019s Saracens who are at a numerical advantage. 18 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-13 Saracens With Exeter laying siege to the Saracens line, George Kruis is penalised for offside. Exeter kick for the corner and will go for the catch-and-drive. They win the line-out, but Owen Farrell puts in a monster tackle to drive them backwards. 17 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-13 Saracens Good work from Exeter from the kick-off, as the make ground with some superb running to within a metre of the Saracens try-line. Saracens score their second try following some great ball-carrying from Billy Vunipola off the scrum and then George Kruis, who makes another couple of yards. Scrum-half Ben Spencer goes over for the try but ... weirdly, Owen Farrell fails to add the extras. 13 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-8 Saracens An Exeter scrum just inside their own 22 is awarded the other way after the men in black fall foul of Wayne Barnes, the referee. 11 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-8 Saracens Back to that Saracens try. Owen Farrell kicked for touch and from the ensuing line-out, hooker Jamie George caught the ball and grounded it from the subsequent drive over the line. Owen Farrell kicks Sarries into the lead with a kick that wasn\u2019t one of his better ones, but limped over the bar and between the posts nonetheless. 8 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-5 Saracens Dave Ewars and Alex Cuthbert are penalised for conspiring to not release the ball following a tackle and Saracens have a penalty. What a start to this final!!! Saracens elect to run the penalty and go over. Owen Farrell fails with his conversion. This game has started with quite the bang. 4 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-0 Saracens Following a consultation with the TMO, Wayne Barnes sends Henry Slade to the sin bin. He doesn\u2019t award a penalty try because Jack Nowell was in a position to put in a covering tackle. 3 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-0 Saracens: Having conceded a try on the 27-second mark, Saracens attempt to get a foothold in the game. They advance up the pitch, with Owen Farrell on the overlap on the left touchline. The ball is passed out over the touchline, but there\u2019s a suspicion of a deliberate knock-on from Henry Slade as he made the tackle. He looks destined for the sin-bin, but will there be a penalty try awarded? 1 min: Exeter Chiefs 7-0 Saracens An early handling error from the kick-off by George Kruis allows Exeter\u2019s Alex Cuthbert to lead the charge towards the line and scrum-half Nic White goes over from the ensuing ruck. What a start from Exeter, who add the two points from the conversion. The teams are out: The teams march out on to the pitch, with players of reigning champions Saracens wearing red shirts, shorts and socks. Exeter\u2019s player\u2019s wear black shirts, black shorts and black socks. Kick off is moments away. Not long now: The trophy is out on the pitch and the teams are going through the last of their pre-match niceties in their dressing-rooms. It\u2019s a glorious day for rugby at Twickenham, where the sun is shining brightly. Jack Nowell speaks: \u201cThe emotions that we felt last year, coming in after the game where there were a lot of tears has driven us all through the years,\u201d Exeter\u2019s full-back tells BT Sport, when asked how it feels to be up against Saracens in another final. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be nice to play against these boys.\u201d On the subject of his team\u2019s tactics, he says: \u201cI think Owen Farrell puts his kicks on the money all the time, so we\u2019ve got to be up in the air trying to catch that ball.\u201d Will Skelton speaks: \u201cI think we\u2019re focussed,\u201d says the Saracens second row, in an interview with BT Sport. \u201cIt\u2019s a massive game ahead. We got to attack them at set-piece, it\u2019s where they\u2019re strongest. We have to try and stop their front foot ball. They\u2019ve got some good ball carriers and we\u2019ve got to smash them.\u201d Asked how big a bonus it is that Brad Barritt is fit to start, he doesn\u2019t mince his words. \u201cHe\u2019s inspirational,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way he hits people, his collisions. You aspire to be like him.\u201d Team news Both teams are unchanged from their semi-final wins. Saracens captain Brad Barritt was a doubt for today\u2019s final, but has recovered from a hamstring injury that forced him out of Sarries\u2019 win over Gloucester last weekend. Today\u2019s match officials Referee: Wayne Barnes Assistant Referees: Matthew Carley and Tom Foley TMO: Graham Hughes Exeter Chiefs: Nowell; Cuthbert, Slade, Devoto, O\u2019Flaherty; J.

Twickenham is the venue for a repeat of last year\u2019s final, with Saracens hoping to retain their title and Exeter plotting some long overdue revenge. Exeter topped the Premiership table with 87 points, then beat Northampton Saints in the semi-finals to reach their fourth Premiership Rugby Final in as many years. Having won this title in three of the past four years, Saracens thrashed Gloucester in their semi-final and are looking to win their fifth Premiership title. Kick-off is at 3pm (BST) but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up.",

      "body": "<p>Exeter gave it everything but that is rarely enough against Saracens. On the hottest day of the year the two leading teams in the Premiership both set out to show why they were so far ahead of the rest and, while the Chiefs scored in the opening and final minutes and were dominant in the second and third quarters, they lost the title at the very moment it appeared to be in their grip.</p> <p>There were 20 minutes to go and Exeter had gone ahead 27-16, having scored their fourth try through Henry Slade who finished a sweeping move with a flourish. Saracens had taken charge after Nic White scored 26 seconds into the match after George Kruis had lost control of the ball from the kick-off, vexing the Chiefs through their speed of delivery at the breakdown, but were gradually worn down by the persistence, pressure and power of their opponents who in 37 minutes either side of the break scored 20 points and conceded three.</p> <p>Exeter had been well beaten in their two previous finals against Saracens but this time they did not look out of place. The build-up was marked by a debate over whether the Chiefs were boring, a strange tag given that during the game they became the first team to score 100 tries in a Premiership campaign, but style of play should not have been the issue. Exeter\u2019s rise from the depths of the English league system has been remarkable and in recent seasons they have become the most consistent team in the Premiership, again finishing the regular season at the top of the table, rarely dipping from a high level. Saracens have learned to pace themselves and peak when it matters, even if there were moments in the final when it looked as if the climb had become too steep.</p> <p>The Chiefs reacted to Slade\u2019s try euphorically, not taking victory for granted but knowing that, the way they were playing, they were controlling their destiny and 11 points ahead. Saracens had lost their early 13-7 lead and, at times, looked uncomfortable. They were forced into basic errors, were knocked back in contact and, after the early initiative they seized through the speed of ball they enjoyed at the breakdown faded, they showed signs of malfunctioning.</p> <p>Saracens have become Europe\u2019s leading side because, when it matters, they have players who make a difference.

All the Saracen had to do to score was catch the ball.</p> <p>The gap was now four points but Saracens were in full pursuit of their prey. It was not Exeter who were making the minor errors: it was the hottest day of the year but even more heat was being applied by Saracens who seized the moment with 13 minutes to go when Richard Wigglesworth spotted space around the fringe of a ruck and set off. He was supported by the front-rows Jamie George and Ralph Adams-Hale before Saracens quickly moved the ball to Sean Maitland on the left wing. Having come from 10 points down against Leinster to win the Champions Cup last month, Saracens went one better. The three-point lead became 10 when George scored his second try of the afternoon after Maro Itoje stole an Exeter line-out with four minutes to go.</p> <p>After George and Ben Spencer had replied to White\u2019s try, Exeter played probably their best 40 minutes since their promotion to the Premiership. At one point they had 70 per cent of possession and had attempted 100 fewer tackles than their opponents. There is no team more difficult to stop close to the line and, when Dave Ewers and Jonny Hill scored from close range in the second quarter, 10 of their last 14 tries had been claimed by forwards. Saracens were, for once, losing the physical battle.

When Slade extended their lead after 57 minutes, a team that a year ago vowed to make up for finishing a distant second to Saracens in the final looked to have lived up to their word \u2013 except they were playing Saracens, a team that had won theirprevious six finals.

      "body": "<p>Greeted by a near-glowing emerald green pitch and balmy Cardiff conditions, New Zealand opened their Cricket World Cup campaign as if they were whipping out the flip-flops and savouring a casual summer stroll.</p> <p>Their 10-wicket victory over slumping Sri Lanka, secured with 203 balls to spare, really was that comfortable. Much tougher assignments await but New Zealand could not have wished for a better start. Winning the toss and bowling first certainly enhanced this mismatch but they still had to exploit the favourable conditions. By doing just that, once again they proved when the ball swings or seams this unit poses major problems.</p> <p>Led by the swift redemption of Matt Henry and a template they hope to replicate throughout this tournament, New Zealand\u2019s attack felt right at home on a surface that mirrored the Kermit green often seen on the first morning of a Test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington.</p> <p>On the evidence of this effort Sri Lanka could well contest the wooden spoon. Regardless, this was always a must-win match for New Zealand\u2019s hopes of at least reaching the semi-finals. With one dominant win in the books and Bangladesh and Afghanistan to follow in the first week, the chance is there for early successes before the headline fixtures arrive.</p> <p>There were no signs of first-game jitters nor disruption despite New Zealand juggling late changes after a calf complaint ruled out the experienced seamer Tim Southee and a hamstring problem with Henry Nicholls forced a reshuffle at the top of the order.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jun/01/ben-stokes-magic-england-cricket-world-cup\">Ben Stokes magic conjures higher hopes of England success | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In what shaped as a tight selection call before Southee\u2019s withdrawal, Henry grabbed the new ball and seized his chance with three for 29 that ripped through Sri Lanka\u2019s meek resistance with a man-of-the-match spell. It was a far cry from Henry\u2019s performance in New Zealand\u2019s final warm-up match when West Indies thumped him to all parts of Bristol on the way to figures of two for 107 from nine overs.</p> <p>While Trent Boult, the second-ranked bowler at this tournament, struggled for consistency, Henry found quality support from Lockie Ferguson, New Zealand\u2019s answer to Jofra Archer, who finished with three for 22. Henry, Ferguson and Colin de Grandhomme, with his nibble away, all struck in their first overs to have Sri Lanka on the ropes. Such was the horror show at one stage they lost five wickets for 14 runs. From there they never recovered.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/audio/2019/may/31/ben-stokess-catch-of-the-century-and-the-hundred-names-the-spin-podcast\">Ben Stokes\u2019s \u2018catch of the century\u2019 and The Hundred names \u2013 The Spin podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sri Lanka\u2019s captain, Dimuth Karunaratne, did his best to restore respectability as he became the 12th batsman in ODIs to carry his bat with all his teammates dismissed \u2013 the second in World Cups after West Indies\u2019 Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 1999.

The strong contingent of Sri Lanka supporters made their feelings clear with a chorus of boos at the end of the match.</p> <p>By the time Martin Guptill and Colin Munro, promoted to fill Nicholls\u2019s place, strode out to reply in the early afternoon sun, the wicket had flattened and they used their feet to counter any lingering movement.</p> <p>With the pressure off, Guptill and Munro played with freedom Sri Lanka never enjoyed to notch their highest opening partnership.

      "bodyText": "Greeted by a near-glowing emerald green pitch and balmy Cardiff conditions, New Zealand opened their Cricket World Cup campaign as if they were whipping out the flip-flops and savouring a casual summer stroll. Their 10-wicket victory over slumping Sri Lanka, secured with 203 balls to spare, really was that comfortable. Much tougher assignments await but New Zealand could not have wished for a better start. Winning the toss and bowling first certainly enhanced this mismatch but they still had to exploit the favourable conditions. By doing just that, once again they proved when the ball swings or seams this unit poses major problems. Led by the swift redemption of Matt Henry and a template they hope to replicate throughout this tournament, New Zealand\u2019s attack felt right at home on a surface that mirrored the Kermit green often seen on the first morning of a Test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. On the evidence of this effort Sri Lanka could well contest the wooden spoon. Regardless, this was always a must-win match for New Zealand\u2019s hopes of at least reaching the semi-finals. With one dominant win in the books and Bangladesh and Afghanistan to follow in the first week, the chance is there for early successes before the headline fixtures arrive. There were no signs of first-game jitters nor disruption despite New Zealand juggling late changes after a calf complaint ruled out the experienced seamer Tim Southee and a hamstring problem with Henry Nicholls forced a reshuffle at the top of the order. In what shaped as a tight selection call before Southee\u2019s withdrawal, Henry grabbed the new ball and seized his chance with three for 29 that ripped through Sri Lanka\u2019s meek resistance with a man-of-the-match spell. It was a far cry from Henry\u2019s performance in New Zealand\u2019s final warm-up match when West Indies thumped him to all parts of Bristol on the way to figures of two for 107 from nine overs. While Trent Boult, the second-ranked bowler at this tournament, struggled for consistency, Henry found quality support from Lockie Ferguson, New Zealand\u2019s answer to Jofra Archer, who finished with three for 22. Henry, Ferguson and Colin de Grandhomme, with his nibble away, all struck in their first overs to have Sri Lanka on the ropes. Such was the horror show at one stage they lost five wickets for 14 runs. From there they never recovered. Sri Lanka\u2019s captain, Dimuth Karunaratne, did his best to restore respectability as he became the 12th batsman in ODIs to carry his bat with all his teammates dismissed \u2013 the second in World Cups after West Indies\u2019 Ridley Jacobs against Australia in 1999. But his lone half-century barely saved face. The strong contingent of Sri Lanka supporters made their feelings clear with a chorus of boos at the end of the match. By the time Martin Guptill and Colin Munro, promoted to fill Nicholls\u2019s place, strode out to reply in the early afternoon sun, the wicket had flattened and they used their feet to counter any lingering movement. With the pressure off, Guptill and Munro played with freedom Sri Lanka never enjoyed to notch their highest opening partnership. Guptill\u2019s unbeaten 73 from 51 balls should settle nerves and after a lean trot Munro\u2019s first half-century in 18 ODI innings will ease pressure on his shoulders. The final aspect New Zealand take from this whitewash is a positive run-rate. With semi-final places set to be hotly contested, such an early boost cannot be scoffed at. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice to have a healthy run-rate at the start of a tournament,\u201d Guptill said. \u201cOnce we had them seven or eight down we wanted to try to knock them over and the runs off as quick as possible. \u201cThe beauty about our guys is they can exploit those conditions quite regularly. We put the ball in the right areas enough to get the rewards up front. \u201cIf we bowl first in the next few games hopefully we can continue to make it difficult for the guys to score and if we can come out and play with the freedom with the bat like we did today we\u2019re going to have a pretty successful tournament.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>M<a href=\"https://www.mahanesfahani.com/\" title=\"\">ahan Esfahani</a> was nine when he first heard a harpsichord. He and his parents were visiting Iran, the country where he was born, and which his family had left for the US five years before. \u201cAn uncle gave me a bunch of cassettes,\u201d he says. \u201cOne was of Karl Richter [the German conductor and harpsichordist] playing Bach. Well, I listened to it, and I thought: \u2018This is what I\u2019ve got to do.\u2019 I don\u2019t mean in terms of a career. I just thought my life would be well spent in the company of this instrument. I thought I would get a profession, which is what every Iranian parent wants for their child, and that \u2013 once I was a doctor or lawyer \u2013 I\u2019d be able to buy a harpsichord, and play at home.\u201d</p> <p>Was it like falling in love? \u201cYes, absolutely it was.\u201d Can he describe how the sound of it made him feel? He thinks for a moment: it\u2019s hard to put into words. \u201cWhen I played the flute or the violin, which I did seriously, it was as if there was a hand over my mouth. The second I played a harpsichord, it was as if the hand had been removed. This was the sound I\u2019d been looking for to express myself.\u201d</p> <p>Conducting this new love affair wasn\u2019t easy in suburban America (the family lived in Rockville, Maryland). All he could do was borrow as many recordings as possible from the library, and practise the piano in the hope that his fingers would one day dash across the keyboards of a harpsichord instead. \u201cBut one weekend when I was 16, two big things happened: I was invited to my first party, and my father bought a harpsichord kit, and we put it together. I remember that my mother was upset, because we had to move a flower arrangement.\u201d</p> <p>For the next couple of years, he messed around on this instrument, getting to know it, learning how to tune it, and then he went off to Stanford University, where he was supposed to study medicine, then law, then history (he kept changing his mind). In truth, what he did mostly was to hang around the music faculty. \u201cI started taking harpsichord lessons immediately. Playing it was all I wanted to do, all the time.\u201d Eventually, he persuaded his parents to let him study musicology; he promised to do a doctorate and become an academic. But by the time he was ready to graduate, he had other ideas: \u201cI wanted to try this harpsichord thing.\u201d</p> <p>Esfahani and I are talking in a rehearsal room at the Wigmore Hall in London, where that night he will play, among other pieces, Bach\u2019s Suite in G Minor. Now a highly acclaimed harpsichordist with an international reputation, Esfahani, who was <a href=\"https://www.mahanesfahani.com/biography/\" title=\"\">born in 1984</a>, is part of a new generation of players who are helping to give, as <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/05/21/the-rebel-harpsichordists\" title=\"\">Alex Ross put it</a> in the <em>New Yorker</em> last year, \u201can almost hipsterish profile to an instrument that has often been stereotyped as archaic and twee\u201d. You could say, then, that \u201cthe harpsichord thing\u201d did work out in the end.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"76fec2248ba28e58a13429cccce35c97849af26d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76fec2248ba28e58a13429cccce35c97849af26d/0_133_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahan Esfahani performs at Milton Court\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahan Esfahani performs at Milton Court.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Allan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And yet, he is restless. The struggle, for him, is not quite over. \u201cEvery career is just an eternal series of little breaks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my breaks, and I\u2019m happy. But in terms of getting the harpsichord to where it needs to be, that hasn\u2019t happened yet. When people hear the word \u2018harpsichord\u2019, a guard goes up. You have to push it from the musicianship and engagement side, of course. But you also have to push it from the \u2018Come on, people, give up these preconceptions\u2019 side, too. The harpsichord is like the posh, pretty boy in the prison. He\u2019s gonna get beaten on.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s definitely not wrong about this. Given its genteel reputation \u2013 picture dutiful daughters in sprigged muslin dresses, or perhaps the earnest types Kingsley Amis sends up in the madrigal scene in <em>Lucky Jim</em> \u2013 the harpsichord is an oddly divisive instrument. Take the way it sounds. For some, this will always bring to mind the <em>Addams Family</em> theme tune, an association they may regard as entirely appropriate. The conductor Thomas Beecham <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/friday_review/story/0,3605,468909,00.html\" title=\"\">compared it</a> with the noise made by \u201ctwo skeletons copulating on a tin roof\u201d; the composer John Cage likened it to a sewing machine.</p> <p>But even those who love the instrument are often at war \u2013 if only with themselves. Harpsichord Land, as Esfahani likes to call it, is a peculiar and occasionally rather bitchy realm that has long been inhabited by two factions: the proponents of early music, whose obsession is with authenticity; and the modernists, who long to expand the canon, in the hope that the harpsichord might fill the grandest concert halls once again. If you\u2019re him, all this makes for tricky territory \u2013 to the point where he is sometimes moved to describe himself as suffering from a \u201cpersecution complex\u201d.</p> <p>His problems are twofold. First, how might he turn the heads (or ears) of those who insist they would rather listen to the piano, the instrument that superseded the harpsichord over the course of the 18th century. Second, how might he convince the purists that it\u2019s possible to be both a traditionalist and a modernist? Esfahani loves Bach, as anyone who heard his recent <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0003cbv/episodes/guide\" title=\"\">Radio 3 series</a> about the composer will know; Bach is the golden thread that runs through his life. But he is also known, these days, for playing more modern music: Poulenc, Ligeti, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/18/mahan-esfahani-review-milton-court-london-harpsichord-john-cage\" title=\"\">even John Cage</a> (revenge takes many forms). \u201cCan\u2019t I just be myself?\u201d he asks, his voice rising mock-neurotically.</p> <p>After Stanford, he went to Boston, where he took daily lessons from Peter Watchorn, a Bach specialist. Watchorn took him under his wing, but it wasn\u2019t a happy time. Esfahani and his parents were not speaking; he was broke; he was coming to terms with his sexuality. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sit at the back of an ensemble, and play continuum,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be a soloist. But to do that, I knew I had to get to Europe, and I had no financial support and no visa. I think the bitterness of those years led to a lot of my mouthing off later to the media about how there are disadvantages for people [in classical music] if they\u2019re not European or the right ethnicity. I do still believe that, but perhaps there are nicer ways of saying it.\u201d Still, he kept pushing. \u201cYou get this thing said about you all the time: he\u2019s ambitious. But I had to be.

She heard it on the radio, and wrote to me to congratulate me. \u2018Oh, man,\u2019 I thought. \u2018She\u2019s still alive.\u2019 She was an idol to me.\u201d Ruzickova, a Holocaust survivor, had played with the conductor Herbert von Karajan, and among her pupils had been Christopher Hogwood, the founder of the Academy of Ancient Music. Esfahani badgered her to take him on. She repeatedly refused (she had cancer) \u2013 until, one day, having heard him play Haydn on the piano, she finally gave in.</p> <p>Ruzickova changed everything for him. \u201cI had a lot of insecurity when I met her. I wasn\u2019t French. I wasn\u2019t Dutch. I wasn\u2019t considered kosher by the early music community. She said: \u2018Be yourself.\u2019\u201d She died in 2017, but Esfahani continues to live in Prague, a city where, he says, there are five major orchestras \u2013 and where everyone knows what a harpsichordist is. These days, he is very busy: too busy, almost. \u201cI\u2019ve made my own world,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I got booked to play a couple of concertos, my agent said: \u2018We\u2019ll get one or two of these a year, but your bread and butter will always be recitals.\u2019 But now 50% of what I do is concertos, and very often it\u2019s a modern one. I\u2019ve just had a residency with the Liverpool Philharmonic; I\u2019ve played with the big German and American orchestras.\u201d </p> <p>The history of the harpsichord is long and vexed. Its reign lasted from about 1400 to 1800, during which time the instruments were made by family dynasties, the most famous of which were the Ruckers of Antwerp. But then the piano arrived, and the harpsichord went out of fashion, disappearing for almost a century; the knowhow of the Ruckers and others was lost, because it had not been written down.</p> <p>In the early 20th century, however, two things happened. In London, an eccentric French-Swiss violinist called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/tomserviceblog/2008/jul/02/howdolmetschbreathednewlif\" title=\"\">Arnold Dolmetsch</a> began to get interested in early music. It was Dolmetsch who built the first copy of a historical harpsichord, and in 1916, he fired the first salvo in the wars of historical performance, when he published <em>The Interpretation of the Music of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries</em>. Meanwhile, in Paris, the great French-Polish harpsichordist, Wanda Landowska, had an instrument specially designed for her: a larger model with steel strings (harpsichord strings are traditionally made of brass or iron), which could hold its own in a large concert hall. A number of new works were composed for Landowska and her harpsichord, among them Poulenc\u2019s concerto of 1927, and thus it returned to the orchestra.</p> <p>In the end, it was the early music movement that won the day. By the mid 1970s, the historical purists had largely triumphed. But perhaps this is now beginning to change, at last. In the hands of players like Esfahani, the repertoire is expanding once more. Composers are also writing for it again, among them Michael Nyman. (In a programme Esfahani made for Radio 3 four years ago, Nyman said that he regarded the harpsichord as the \u201csonic equivalent of a cox\u2019s orange pippin\u201d, and the piano as \u201ca very deficient French golden delicious\u201d \u2013 which was nothing if not provocative.)</p> <p>Even now, though, the harpsichord continues to stir up peculiar little scuffles and rows \u2013 and sometimes, Esfahani is at the centre of them. In 2016, he was <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/iranian-musician-forced-to-stop-cologne-concert-after-audience-members-jeer-and-shout-speak-german-a6909066.html\" title=\"\">booed</a> by an audience in Cologne, who objected to him playing Steve Reich on a baroque instrument. (These people were then shouted down by younger members of the audience.) In 2017, a <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/harpsichordists-at-war/\" title=\"\">row</a> blew up following <a href=\"https://van-us.atavist.com/insularities\" title=\"\">an interview</a> he gave to online music magazine VAN, in which he accused some harpsichordists of spreading nationalism. At the Bruges festival, he said, it was horrible to hear students from the Low Countries and France dismissing the Russian school as \u201ctechnicians\u201d. He also said: \u201cHaving funky hair or playing a little bit of jazz doesn\u2019t make you iconoclastic if your harpsichord playing is perfectly orthodox.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/apr/14/mahan-esfahani-rlpo-liverpool-philharmonic-review-jc-bach-ludlow-english-song-weekend\">The week in classical: Mahan Esfahani, RLPO; Ludlow English song weekend \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was taken as a swipe at the young French harpischordist, Jean Rondeau, who sports a man bun and has an interest in improvisation.

      "bodyText": "Mahan Esfahani was nine when he first heard a harpsichord. He and his parents were visiting Iran, the country where he was born, and which his family had left for the US five years before. \u201cAn uncle gave me a bunch of cassettes,\u201d he says. \u201cOne was of Karl Richter [the German conductor and harpsichordist] playing Bach. Well, I listened to it, and I thought: \u2018This is what I\u2019ve got to do.\u2019 I don\u2019t mean in terms of a career. I just thought my life would be well spent in the company of this instrument. I thought I would get a profession, which is what every Iranian parent wants for their child, and that \u2013 once I was a doctor or lawyer \u2013 I\u2019d be able to buy a harpsichord, and play at home.\u201d Was it like falling in love? \u201cYes, absolutely it was.\u201d Can he describe how the sound of it made him feel? He thinks for a moment: it\u2019s hard to put into words. \u201cWhen I played the flute or the violin, which I did seriously, it was as if there was a hand over my mouth. The second I played a harpsichord, it was as if the hand had been removed. This was the sound I\u2019d been looking for to express myself.\u201d Conducting this new love affair wasn\u2019t easy in suburban America (the family lived in Rockville, Maryland). All he could do was borrow as many recordings as possible from the library, and practise the piano in the hope that his fingers would one day dash across the keyboards of a harpsichord instead. \u201cBut one weekend when I was 16, two big things happened: I was invited to my first party, and my father bought a harpsichord kit, and we put it together. I remember that my mother was upset, because we had to move a flower arrangement.\u201d For the next couple of years, he messed around on this instrument, getting to know it, learning how to tune it, and then he went off to Stanford University, where he was supposed to study medicine, then law, then history (he kept changing his mind). In truth, what he did mostly was to hang around the music faculty. \u201cI started taking harpsichord lessons immediately. Playing it was all I wanted to do, all the time.\u201d Eventually, he persuaded his parents to let him study musicology; he promised to do a doctorate and become an academic. But by the time he was ready to graduate, he had other ideas: \u201cI wanted to try this harpsichord thing.\u201d Esfahani and I are talking in a rehearsal room at the Wigmore Hall in London, where that night he will play, among other pieces, Bach\u2019s Suite in G Minor. Now a highly acclaimed harpsichordist with an international reputation, Esfahani, who was born in 1984, is part of a new generation of players who are helping to give, as Alex Ross put it in the New Yorker last year, \u201can almost hipsterish profile to an instrument that has often been stereotyped as archaic and twee\u201d. You could say, then, that \u201cthe harpsichord thing\u201d did work out in the end. And yet, he is restless. The struggle, for him, is not quite over. \u201cEvery career is just an eternal series of little breaks,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve had my breaks, and I\u2019m happy. But in terms of getting the harpsichord to where it needs to be, that hasn\u2019t happened yet. When people hear the word \u2018harpsichord\u2019, a guard goes up. You have to push it from the musicianship and engagement side, of course. But you also have to push it from the \u2018Come on, people, give up these preconceptions\u2019 side, too. The harpsichord is like the posh, pretty boy in the prison. He\u2019s gonna get beaten on.\u201d He\u2019s definitely not wrong about this. Given its genteel reputation \u2013 picture dutiful daughters in sprigged muslin dresses, or perhaps the earnest types Kingsley Amis sends up in the madrigal scene in Lucky Jim \u2013 the harpsichord is an oddly divisive instrument. Take the way it sounds. For some, this will always bring to mind the Addams Family theme tune, an association they may regard as entirely appropriate. The conductor Thomas Beecham compared it with the noise made by \u201ctwo skeletons copulating on a tin roof\u201d; the composer John Cage likened it to a sewing machine. But even those who love the instrument are often at war \u2013 if only with themselves. Harpsichord Land, as Esfahani likes to call it, is a peculiar and occasionally rather bitchy realm that has long been inhabited by two factions: the proponents of early music, whose obsession is with authenticity; and the modernists, who long to expand the canon, in the hope that the harpsichord might fill the grandest concert halls once again. If you\u2019re him, all this makes for tricky territory \u2013 to the point where he is sometimes moved to describe himself as suffering from a \u201cpersecution complex\u201d. His problems are twofold. First, how might he turn the heads (or ears) of those who insist they would rather listen to the piano, the instrument that superseded the harpsichord over the course of the 18th century. Second, how might he convince the purists that it\u2019s possible to be both a traditionalist and a modernist? Esfahani loves Bach, as anyone who heard his recent Radio 3 series about the composer will know; Bach is the golden thread that runs through his life. But he is also known, these days, for playing more modern music: Poulenc, Ligeti, even John Cage (revenge takes many forms). \u201cCan\u2019t I just be myself?\u201d he asks, his voice rising mock-neurotically. After Stanford, he went to Boston, where he took daily lessons from Peter Watchorn, a Bach specialist. Watchorn took him under his wing, but it wasn\u2019t a happy time. Esfahani and his parents were not speaking; he was broke; he was coming to terms with his sexuality. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to sit at the back of an ensemble, and play continuum,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to be a soloist. But to do that, I knew I had to get to Europe, and I had no financial support and no visa. I think the bitterness of those years led to a lot of my mouthing off later to the media about how there are disadvantages for people [in classical music] if they\u2019re not European or the right ethnicity. I do still believe that, but perhaps there are nicer ways of saying it.\u201d Still, he kept pushing. \u201cYou get this thing said about you all the time: he\u2019s ambitious. But I had to be. What else was I going to do?\u201d What happened next, however, was more the result of wild good luck than determination. Having finally got to Milan \u2013 he answered an ad that offered the chance to study the organ there \u2013 he then travelled to London to play at a private event. Someone from the BBC was there and, thanks to this, in 2008 he became the first harpsichordist to be named a BBC Radio 3 new generation artist. \u201cIt was bizarre,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I had no career at that time whatsoever.\u201d All he\u2019d done was a handful of recitals. He moved to Oxford \u2013 with equal unlikeliness, he was also made artist in residence at New College \u2013 and then to London, where he recorded as much as possible. \u201cBut the BBC orchestras\u2026 they didn\u2019t want to do Bach concertos.\u201d For the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra, he agreed to play Poulenc\u2019s harpsichord concerto \u2013 he learned it line by line \u2013 and this turned out to be the start of something. \u201cAfter five years, I\u2019d played most of the contemporary repertoire, and I was known as the guy who played new music \u2013 something I\u2019d only started to do in the first place out of necessity.\u201d In 2010, someone told him about a concerto by the Czech composer, Viktor Kalabis, a \u201cmasterpiece\u201d he then played with the BBC Concert Orchestra. \u201cKalabis was the husband of [the harpsichordist] Zuzana Ruzickova.

The Chelsea winger or playmaker invariably makes her presence felt in the dressing room but, with Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris struggling in the sort of wide roles they no longer really occupy domestically, she may spend more minutes on French fields than initially envisaged. Only two months ago the 31-year-old feared for her place in the squad but she remains one of Phil Neville\u2019s most technically gifted individuals and surely forced herself into the starting XI against Scotland in Nice next Sunday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/01/england-women-new-zealand-women-match-report\">England Women suffer loss to New Zealand in final World Cup warmup</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>2) Looking forward and back</strong></h2> <p>Neville\u2019s side played better than during last week\u2019s win against Denmark but, despite dominating possession, could not deconstruct an intelligent New Zealand defence whose full-backs, in particular, excelled. The Lionesses\u2019 final ball will need to be considerably better in France and they could also do with tightening up at the back. The defending of set pieces, especially, is becoming slapdash. England have lost three of their last five home games and are struggling to score.</p> <h2><strong>3) These two may meet again</strong></h2> <p>Should England top Group D and New Zealand finish as one of the best third-place finishers \u2013 something that seems feasible considering Canada and the Netherlands will be vying for top spot in Group E \u2013 they could yet be reunited with the Ferns and their shrewd 64-year-old Glaswegian manager Tom Sermanni in the round of 16 in Valenciennes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/31/england-women-world-cup-phil-neville-new-zealand\">Phil Neville says he trusts \u2018every single one\u2019 of his 23 World Cup Lionesses</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>4) Sermanni finally </strong><strong>exacts revenge</strong></h2> <p>Scots always enjoy beating the English but Sermanni\u2019s determination to spoil the Lionesses\u2019 party was heightened by memories of being in Vancouver four years ago as one of John Herdman\u2019s assistants.

The Chelsea winger or playmaker invariably makes her presence felt in the dressing room but, with Toni Duggan and Nikita Parris struggling in the sort of wide roles they no longer really occupy domestically, she may spend more minutes on French fields than initially envisaged. Only two months ago the 31-year-old feared for her place in the squad but she remains one of Phil Neville\u2019s most technically gifted individuals and surely forced herself into the starting XI against Scotland in Nice next Sunday. 2) Looking forward and back Neville\u2019s side played better than during last week\u2019s win against Denmark but, despite dominating possession, could not deconstruct an intelligent New Zealand defence whose full-backs, in particular, excelled. The Lionesses\u2019 final ball will need to be considerably better in France and they could also do with tightening up at the back. The defending of set pieces, especially, is becoming slapdash. England have lost three of their last five home games and are struggling to score. 3) These two may meet again Should England top Group D and New Zealand finish as one of the best third-place finishers \u2013 something that seems feasible considering Canada and the Netherlands will be vying for top spot in Group E \u2013 they could yet be reunited with the Ferns and their shrewd 64-year-old Glaswegian manager Tom Sermanni in the round of 16 in Valenciennes. 4) Sermanni finally exacts revenge Scots always enjoy beating the English but Sermanni\u2019s determination to spoil the Lionesses\u2019 party was heightened by memories of being in Vancouver four years ago as one of John Herdman\u2019s assistants. Then England shocked the host nation by knocking Herdman\u2019s side out of Canada 2015 in the quarter-finals. 5) Nayler the No 1 Erin Nayler\u2019s excellent display confounded theories about women not making great goalkeepers.

It contains plenty of W\u2019s and a scant handful of L\u2019s, though it did help that every one of those games was played at home. Of the 50 largest ODI scores in the last four years seven came against Sri Lanka, and only three were by Sri Lanka (New Zealand have a nicely-balanced three entries in each column, and two of their three high scores came against Sri Lanka in their three-match series earlier this year, in which the Black Caps batted first and won on every occasion; they also snuck in a couple of Tests, in the first of which New Zealand notched their biggest ever winning margin, 423 runs).<br></p> <p>New Zealand have played six times at Cardiff and won three of those games; this is Sri Lanka\u2019s fourth visit and they currently have a 0% record there. In the 2013 Champions Trophy these teams met in Cardiff and the game was dramatic, close but won, in the end, by New Zealand, who bowled Sri Lanka out for 138 and only just reached their target, prevailing by one wicket.</p> <p>So everything points to a New Zealand win, even if Tim Southee has a calf injury and probably won\u2019t play. That\u2019s certainly what Brendon McCullum has predicted (Sri Lanka fans, look away now):</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/ByHj1hwHnZI/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

      "bodyText": "And finally, here\u2019s our match report from Liam Napier in Cardiff. Matt Henry, collecting his award, gives a genial interview, handing some of the credit to his time with Kent. \u201cYou don\u2019t get too many one-day wickets like that,\u201d he notes. Thank goodness. He also says, \u201cIt\u2019s a long tournament.\u201d Which is about the only crumb of comfort for Dimuth Karunaratne and his team. If you\u2019re going to have a bad spell, you need to have it early on, then find some momentum. Whether Sri Lanka can manage that seems implausible at the moment, but stranger things have happened. Thanks for your company and your emails \u2013 all five of them. Do switch over to our coverage of Australia-Afghanistan here, and I\u2019ll see you for England-Pakistan at Trent Bridge on Monday. Well, it was a fixture, but it wasn\u2019t a match. New Zealand saw a green surface, went for line and length, and held their slip catches. Sri Lanka, the oldest team in the tournament, played like beginners, getting into a decent position at 46 for 1 and then throwing it all away to slump to 60 for 5, with Matt Henry, the player of the match, picking up 3 for 29. A fifty partnership kept the Sri Lankans in it for a while, but 136 wasn\u2019t even a Twenty20 score and the NZ openers knocked the runs off with a single stratagem, going down the track to negate the movement. If the pitch was too green, so was the Sri Lankan batting. For the second day running, the World Cup has produced a horrible mismatch. Munro pushes a single and that\u2019s that. New Zealand have won, with 33 overs and five balls to spare. 16th over: NZ 136-0 (Guptill 73, Munro 57) Karunaratne turns back to Malinga, perhaps taking the view that the ball will now reverse-swing and the Slinger will pick up five for none. Malinga doesn\u2019t get the memo and dishes up another dud bouncer, so high that it\u2019s a wide. Guptill, who is eyeing a giddy net run-rate, sees the next bouncer coming and slaps it for four to fine leg. And the next, which is also a no-ball. It\u2019s a sad, sad situation, and it\u2019s getting more and \u2013 oh, Malinga produces a fine yorker, which Guptill does well to lay a toe-end on. Another yorker, a clip for two, and the scores are level. 15th over: NZ 120-0 (Guptill 60, Munro 56) Another might-as-well move as Karunaratne sends for a spinner. It\u2019s Jeevan Mendis with his leg breaks. After a few sighters, Guptill gives him the charge and sticks it in the river Taff. New ball, please. That\u2019s drinks with \u2013 on balance, all things considered \u2013 NZ marginally in front. 14th over: NZ 109-0 (Guptill 51, Munro 55) Munro shovels Perera for a couple and joins his mate on fifty. He\u2019s taken 41 balls, so much the same, without the dancing family. His celebration takes the form of a whack past mid-off for four. SL respond next ball with a review for caught behind, of the might-as-well variety. Not out. And hope, which is supposed to spring eternal, slips out of the ground. 13th over: NZ 101-0 (Guptill 50, Munro 48) Guptill brings up his fifty, and the hundred, by lofting Udana over long-on for six. It\u2019s taken him only 39 balls, 24 of which he has scored off. In the stand, his wife and baby, both wearing Black Caps shirts, do a little jig. 12th over: NZ 91-0 (Guptill 41, Munro 47) Another edge, as Munro wafts at Perera, but he gets away with it again because Karunaratne is no Steve Waugh. Munro then rubs it in by shimmying down the track and slamming the ball back past Perera for four. Meanwhile, some better news from the other game: Afghanistan are recovering against Australia. 11th over: NZ 82-0 (Guptill 39, Munro 41) More spark from Udana, but he can\u2019t prevent five singles. These two have been busy in between the big shots. 10th over: NZ 77-0 (Guptill 36, Munro 39) Another change as Thisara Perera comes on, looking for wickets to add to a spirited little knock. He almost gets Guptill, chipping over mid-off\u2019s shoulder, and then he almost gets Munro, with a regulation nick through the now-vacant first slip. That\u2019s the end of the powerplay, and surely the end of Sri Lanka\u2019s faint hopes too. 9th over: NZ 68-0 (Guptill 31, Munro 35) Karunaratne has finally noticed that this is not a Test match. He takes Malinga off and brings on Isuru Udana, who\u2019s a sparky left-armer. He twice finds Guptill\u2019s edge, only to see both nicks go for four. NZ are almost half-way already. Come on you gods, give the Sri Lankans a break. 8th over: NZ 55-0 (Guptill 22, Munro 31) The cruise continues as Munro flicks Lakmal off his pads for four \u2013 a bad ball, but very well put away. Kumar Sangakkara, who is commentating, noticed a few overs ago that Munro was trying too hard to find some form. \u201cHe needs to wait, the right ball will come along and he\u2019ll play it nicely and feel better, and batting will get easier. That\u2019s all it takes.\u201d The ball in question was the limp bouncer from Lakmal (6th over) that he cut for four. Commentary so good, you could record it and use it as coaching. 7th over: NZ 50-0 (Guptill 19, Munro 29) Ten off Malinga\u2019s over, 50 up, and poor old Sri Lanka are heading for a humiliation. \u201cIs there any good reason,\u201d asks John Leavey, \u201cwhy WC games are starting at 10.30 rather than 11.00? Takes us back to the (good/bad) old days of the Gillette Cup when \u2018win the toss and bowl\u2019 was the mantra. Less of an issue these days with the non-swinging white balls, but surely there is still a distinct advantage in bowling first. Seems strange to have moved the start from the norm. Are Indian TV viewers really that sensitive to what time they crack open the beers and snacks?\u201d Another good question. The way things are going, teams are going to be playing five seamers, and they\u2019ll only need three of them. 6th over: NZ 40-0 (Guptill 16, Munro 22) Lakmal too drops short, and Munro says thanks very much with a lofted cut. Next ball, Lakmal goes full and Munro slogs him into the back row of the stand, where the bloke in the black T-shirt sticks out a hand and spills the chance. That\u2019s NZ\u2019s first six, and 14 off the over. Can Karunaratne, who was a rather passive observer of the carnage this morning, do something about it? 5th over: NZ 26-0 (Guptill 16, Munro 9) Malinga is trying to bounce Guptill out, which is a surprising choice on a greentop. Guptill responds with two crisp safe pulls, one for a single, the other for four. Brendon McCullum spots that the batsmen are going down the track to stop the bowlers bowling the ball that did the damage earlier \u2013 the classic length ball aimed at the top of off. 4th over: NZ 19-0 (Guptill 11, Munro 7) Guptill gives Lakmal hope for a split second as he plays a loose upper cut, but it\u2019s not that close to the man at gully. Karunaratne has three men in catching positions when Steve Waugh would have had six. 3rd over: NZ 16-0 (Guptill 10, Munro 6) Malinga the Slinger goes for some singles, but he\u2019s not here to keep it tight. The pitch looks like one of those smoothies that are a little too healthy for comfort. 2nd over: NZ 13-0 (Guptill 9, Munro 4) The other opening bowler is Suranga Lakmal, who finds some swing and lift straight away. Munro shovels him round to long leg for two, and then takes a quick single. Come on you Lankans, get an early wicket. 1st over: NZ 10-0 (Guptill 9, Munro 1) The new ball is taken by Lasith Malinga, the last superstar standing in Sri Lankan cricket. He draws the edge second ball, but the slips are too deep to cash in \u2013 agonising stuff. Martin Guptill celebrates his escape with a whack over extra cover for four. To rub salt into the wound, he adds a hook for four. And here\u2019s John Starbuck. \u201cThe past few CWC matches don\u2019t seem to have carried the option/link to the full scorecard somewhere in the heading. Is this deliberate or did someone just forget?\u201d Good question, I will ask the top brass. \u201cAlso, I\u2019ve often wondered if OBO writers keep, in these data-driven days, a scorecard of their own relating to emails received/printed?\u201d John, there\u2019s data, and there\u2019s utter insanity. So, gameplans. NZ need to get off to a fast start, to make this modest target look ridiculous. SL need at least three wickets in the first powerplay, and ideally six. Thanks Simon and afternoon everyone (well it is, just). What a dismal morning that was. At one end, the Sri Lankans took one look at a greentop and batted like amateurs, making 73 for 9 off 94 balls. At the other, their captain crawled to 52 not out off 84 balls, perhaps on the basis of \u201cwhen in Britain, bat like Boycott and Brearley in 1979\u201d. Still, all is not lost: we have an email. \u201cI\u2019ve sussed it,\u201d says Andrew Benton. \u201cThe Pakistan and Sri Lanka teams are free-to-air fans and are deliberately depriving advertisers of airtime! A truly principled stand. Hats off, gents.\u201d There was some excellent bowling and some superb fielding from New Zealand, but that was a wildly substandard batting performance from Sri Lanka. On the plus side, Karunaratne had joined a very select club: And with that I hand you over to Tim de Lisle, who will lead you through the Black Caps\u2019 response. All emails to him here, please, or tweet him @TimdeLisle. Bye! 30.2 overs: Sri Lanka 136 all out Karunaratne survives the closest of shaves from the first ball of the over, hitting to deep square leg where Santner runs in to collect the ball diving forward. They go upstairs to check the catch and the soft signal is out, but replays show the ball hitting the turf as the catch is completed. It makes not the slightest sniff of a difference, as Malinga is cleaned out next ball! Malinga gives himself some room, Ferguson drives the ball straight through it, and that\u2019s yer lot! 29th over: Sri Lanka 135-9 (Karunaratne 51, Malinga 1) Karunaratne completes his half-century, from 81 deliveries, with a smartly-scampered two. Nine down! Boult bangs one in short, Lakmal goes for a wild pull but the line\u2019s too good, Lakmal is cramped up and the ball is skied to cover! 28th over: Sri Lanka 130-8 (Karunaratne 48, Lakmal 7) Ferguson bowls full, wide of off stump, and Karunaratne flicks it just wide of leg stump and away for four. Then Lakmal top-edges the ball up and behind him; it lands safe and what\u2019s more it\u2019s a no-ball. That gives Karunaratne a free hit; Ferguson goes shortish, and the batsman ducks under it, making the unusual decision not to even try to hit a free hit! 27th over: Sri Lanka 122-8 (Karunaratne 43, Lakmal 5) Lakmal defends Boult\u2019s first delivery, and promptly swaps bats. With his new blade he heaves wildly at everything that comes his way, finally connecting with the penultimate ball of the over, which he heaves over cover. 26th over: Sri Lanka 117-8 (Karunaratne 43, Lakmal 0) Lockie Ferguson is back to frighten out the last couple of Sri Lankans. He very nearly claims Karunaratne, who can\u2019t get his bat out of the way of a short ball but it flicks off the shoulder, loops up and Latham can only get his gloved fingertips to it. 25th over: Sri Lanka 115-8 (Karunaratne 42, Lakmal 0) Well Sri Lanka have made it halfway through their allocation of overs. So there\u2019s that. Udana chips the ball straight to mid on, who takes the easiest of catches! 24th over: Sri Lanka 113-7 (Karunaratne 41, Udana 0) Again a Perera comes in, scores high-20s and then gets caught in the deep. Perera tries to repeat the shot that brought him six runs in the last over but his timing his off and the ball drops 20 yards inside the rope, where Boult is waiting! 23rd over: Sri Lanka 111-6 (Karunaratne 40, T Perera 27) Neesham bowls a disastrous, wildly wide beamer no-ball, and Perera hoists the free hit over midwicket and into the very back of the stand! 22nd over: Sri Lanka 100-6 (Karunaratne 38, T Perera 19) A change of pace, with Mitchell Santner joining the fray, and he drops a sharp caught-and-bowled chance! Perera absolutely smashes it at him, but though Santner gets both hands to it he can\u2019t get them catch-ready in time. 21st over: Sri Lanka 97-6 (Karunaratne 36, T Perera 18) Shot! That\u2019s the best shot of Karunaratne\u2019s innings and only his third boundary, whipped off his ankles and through midwicket for four. 20th over: Sri Lanka 92-6 (Karunaratne 31, T Perera 18) Neesham is rewarded for his fielding exploits with a bit of bowling. Eight off it. 19th over: Sri Lanka 84-6 (Karunaratne 26, T Perera 15) Trent Boult is back, as New Zealand try to finish this innings while the going\u2019s good, but with no instant reward. Also good is Neesham\u2019s fielding, at backward point this time, diving and stretching and brilliantly stopping Karunaratne\u2019s shot. 18th over: Sri Lanka 82-6 (Karunaratne 26, T Perera 14) Sky show Neesham being moved to gully after one ball of Ferguson\u2019s last over; he caught Mendis there off the very next delivery. I always find it particularly cool when that happens, a bit like Babe Ruth\u2019s called shot only better, because it\u2019s someone else\u2019s shot that has been called. 17th over: Sri Lanka 80-6 (Karunaratne 25, T Perera 13) The first six of the day from Thisara Perera, who heaves De Grandhomme over square leg for a maximum. 12 off the over. 16th over: Sri Lanka 68-6 (Karunaratne 23, T Perera 3) There\u2019s a wild, wide bouncer here from Ferguson, by a distance the worst ball of the innings. This is a very different collapse to Pakistan\u2019s yesterday, appearing to be caused not by a particular tactic, remorselessly and effectively pursued, but just a good bowling line-up proving too good for some poor batters. Another one! Mendis gets a thick edge to a ball coming across him and Neesham takes a good low catch at gully! 15th over: Sri Lanka 60-5 (Karunaratne 19, Mathews 1) Matt Henry is finally stood down, and Colin de Grandhomme gets a wicket with his fourth ball. There\u2019s almost another as well, Mendis skewing the final delivery over a desperate, grasping fielder at backward point. A tiny whisper of an edge, a straightforward catch, Angelo Mathews goes for a nine-ball duck and Sri Lanka\u2019s deep, dark hole keeps getting deeper. And also darker. 14th over: Sri Lanka 58-4 (Karunaratne 18, Mathews 0) A tasty 91mph yorker from Ferguson is dug out by Mathews, who is yet to get off the mark after seven deliveries. He did crack the last ball of the over to midwicket for what looked like an inevitable four, but somehow Boult plucked the bouncing rocket out of the air while diving low to his right, a phenomenal piece of fielding. 13th over: Sri Lanka 57-4 (Karunaratne 17, Mathews 0) Henry just keeps on going. This partnership cannot fail now. And also, Karunaratne has to start scoring actual runs at some point. This has been a very 1980s ODI innings from the captain. 12th over: Sri Lanka 53-4 (Karunaratne 14, Mathews 0) So the first bowling change sees Lockie Ferguson enter the fray, and after his first few deliveries are clocked at just a shade under 90mph he speeds up a bit. The last three overs have brought three runs and a wicket. Ferguson\u2019s extra pace does for De Silva, who can\u2019t get anything on the ball as it heads for the top of middle stump at 91mph! 11th over: Sri Lanka 52-3 (Karunaratne 13, De Silva 4) We\u2019ve had eleven overs without a bowling change, which seems unusual. Henry\u2019s sixth over costs just the one run. 10th over: Sri Lanka 51-3 (Karunaratne 12, De Silva 4) Boult\u2019s over starts with three dots, and ends with a couple more. Karunaratne has compiled a 27-ball 12 with two near-misses, and looks a bit like someone who\u2019s only played one ODI in the last four years, which of course he is. 9th over: Sri Lanka 50-3 (Karunaratne 11, De Silva 4) De Silva comes out to face the hat-trick ball, which is full and just wide of off stump, and he drives it beautifully past mid-off for four! That\u2019s a lovely delivery, takes the edge and heads to second slip. It doesn\u2019t get there, though, because Guptill, at third slip, dives to his left and gets there first! Two in two for Henry at the start of this over! Perera\u2019s excellent innings comes to a clumsy end, as he wildly mis-hits the ball into the stratosphere, giving the fielding side enough time to engage in an leisurely game of quoits before it comes back down. De Grandhomme does the honours at mid-on. 8th over: Sri Lanka 45-1 (K Perera 29, Karunaratne 11) Karunaratne has another go at chopping on, the ball this time bouncing a foot or so wide of off stump. The batsmen have each faced 23 deliveries, with very different returns. Karunaratne has only ever played one ODI innings at more than a run a ball (and he only got 16*). 7th over: Sri Lanka 41-1 (K Perera 26, Karunaratne 10) Brilliant fielding from Boult at third man turns four runs to two. \u201cBrendan\u2019s got West Indies down to beat Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka to beat West Indies,\u201d notes Romeo. \u201cMaybe it\u2019ll turn out to be a tie.\u201d 6th over: Sri Lanka 35-1 (K Perera 21, Karunaratne 9) Crack! Perera slaps Boult\u2019s first delivery, short and wide, past point for four. Thwack! The second is hoisted over cover for four more. Then Karunaratne nearly chops onto the stumps! In fact, he does chop on! Kind of! He tries to ease the ball down to third man but there\u2019s not enough width, and as the ball whistles by off stump visibly wobbles, but those bails aren\u2019t for budging! 5th over: Sri Lanka 25-1 (K Perera 12, Karunaratne 9) Henry\u2019s first ball is clobbered right back past him by Perera. \u201cIsn\u2019t it about time we stopped all this \u2018pitch reading\u2019 nonsense?\u201d pleads Gary Naylor. \u201cWhether a pitch is green, brown, white, purple has no bearing whatsoever on how it plays. Since it\u2019s about the only aspect of cricket not dataed to death, it\u2019s the bluffers\u2019 last refuge.\u201d Does the amount of moisture in the pitch, as indicated by the growth upon it, not make quite a bit of difference? I mean, I\u2019ve never played cricket to a level high enough for anything about the pitch to make the slightest difference except for the number of molehills on it, but that does seem pretty clear... 4th over: Sri Lanka 20-1 (K Perera 7, Karunaratne 9) Boult\u2019s first ball thunders into Karunaratne\u2019s pad, briefly exciting the bowler, but it was heading well down leg. His second is a snorter, forcing a defensive prod and then sliding away and just past the bat. The Sri Lanka captain does edge the next one, but it\u2019s thick enough to go well wide of the slips and away for four, and one of those slips then peels off and heads to third man. Then good, aggressive running ekes a couple of bonus runs from the last couple of deliveries. 3rd over: Sri Lanka 12-1 (K Perera 6, Karunaratne 2) Henry delivers the ball right into the slot and Perera swings through it, hoisting the ball over cover for four. 2nd over: Sri Lanka 7-1 (K Perera 2, Karunaratne 1) Boult bowls to Karunaratne, with three slips in place, but doesn\u2019t really threaten the edge. Still, the over starts with four dots. \u201cIn the first Test between these two sides from 15-19 December, a veteran Sri Lankan (Angelo Matthews) scored 120* in one of the greatest Test matches of all time,\u201d recalls an optimistic Abhijato Sensarma. \u201cIn the second ODI between the same sides on 5th January, another Sri Lankan veteran (Thisara Perera) scored 140 in one of the greatest ODI matches of all time. Today is a perfect day to complete the triad - these two teams are meeting again, in the third match of the biggest tournament of all time, with a third Sri Lankan captain at the helm. If we see a third classical performance from a veteran in a clash we\u2019ll remember for the ages, it\u2019s going to be beyond poetic!\u201d 1st over: Sri Lanka 4-1 (K Perera 0, Karunaratne 0) The first ball of the day from Matt Henry is tucked to fine leg by Thirimanne for four, but the bowler\u2019s revenge is not long in coming. Here\u2019s a good view of today\u2019s pitch: He is you know! The umpire must have heard two noises and decided the ball had flicked the bat on its way through, but the instant it became clear that was not the case, Thirimanne was in a whole heap of trouble. Three reds, and he\u2019s gone! The umpire didn\u2019t think so, but New Zealand are keen... The first half-hour could be key, and might also be a bit fun. Trent Boult on a green surface at 10.30am on the first day in June could be a bit testy. Enough talk, though. It\u2019s time to find out. Today\u2019s teams, then: Sri Lanka: Dimuth Karunaratne (c), Lahiru Thirimanne, Kusal Perera (wk), Kusal Mendis, Angelo Mathews, Dhananjaya de Silva, Thisara Perera, Isuru Udana, Jeevan Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Lasith Malinga. New Zealand: Martin Guptill, Colin Munro, Kane Williamson (c), Tom Latham (wk), Ross Taylor, James Neesham, Colin de Grandhomme, Mitchell Santner, Matt Henry, Lockie Ferguson, Trent Boult. The teams are out and enjoying their anthems. Just a few minutes away from action now. Weather update: the clouds that dulled the sky at the toss seem to be clearing and the weather is good. There is a 4% chance of rain today. We\u2019ll take that. Sri Lanka would also have bowled first. Dimuth Karunaratne says that \u201cwe don\u2019t have much pressure\u201d and hopes his side will thumb their collective nose at the naysayers. Kane Williamson spots \u201ca surface with a green tinge\u201d and wants to take advantage. WWWWLWWWLWWWLW This is New Zealand\u2019s record against Sri Lanka since the start of 2015*. It contains plenty of W\u2019s and a scant handful of L\u2019s, though it did help that every one of those games was played at home. Of the 50 largest ODI scores in the last four years seven came against Sri Lanka, and only three were by Sri Lanka (New Zealand have a nicely-balanced three entries in each column, and two of their three high scores came against Sri Lanka in their three-match series earlier this year, in which the Black Caps batted first and won on every occasion; they also snuck in a couple of Tests, in the first of which New Zealand notched their biggest ever winning margin, 423 runs). New Zealand have played six times at Cardiff and won three of those games; this is Sri Lanka\u2019s fourth visit and they currently have a 0% record there. In the 2013 Champions Trophy these teams met in Cardiff and the game was dramatic, close but won, in the end, by New Zealand, who bowled Sri Lanka out for 138 and only just reached their target, prevailing by one wicket. So everything points to a New Zealand win, even if Tim Southee has a calf injury and probably won\u2019t play. That\u2019s certainly what Brendon McCullum has predicted (Sri Lanka fans, look away now): * These teams played a lot in 2015. Between 11 January 2015 and 5 January 2016 there were 13 ODIs scheduled, two of which were lost to bad weather.",

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s a high street that encapsulates the tale of two retailers. On the Holloway Road in north London, Marks &amp; Spencer will shut up shop on Saturday after 105 years as part of the local community. Just a few days before the doors close for the final time, the company, which joined the stock market in 1926, could be turfed out of the FTSE 100 index of leading companies for the first time since the blue-chip index was set up in 1984. Just a short walk from the M&amp;S front door is a small JD Sports shop. On Thursday it was busy with shoppers of all ages, many of whom emerged with one of the shop\u2019s distinctive brightly coloured bags over their shoulder. JD is set to join the FTSE 100 for the first time, potentially jumping into the spot vacated by its older, and ailing, rival. The M&amp;S share price has halved in the last five years. It now has a stockmarket value of just \u00a34.4bn, about \u00a31.6bn less than that of its much young rival JD Sports Fashion. After bumper growth at home and a number of acquisitions that have turned JD into a worldwide business, the sportswear group has more than tripled its sales in the past five years to \u00a34.7bn. Its profits are up three and a half times to \u00a3355m. Sales at M&amp;S last year were more than \u00a310bn, but last month it reported profits down 62% to \u00a367m after a \u00a3500m bill for restructuring that included more than \u00a3300m to pay for closures such as Holloway Road. JD\u2019s executive chairman, Peter Cowgill, has been awarded a controversial \u00a36m cash bonus for what the company called an \u201coutstanding performance\u201d. JD has been riding the crest of a fashion wave driven by a shift towards casual dressing across generations and in the workplace as well as in the pub and at home. Consumer spending on sports and outdoor fashion has risen by nearly 50% since 2013 to an estimated \u00a37.6bn, according to market research firm Mintel. That\u2019s partly down to the athleisure trend where taking part in sporty activities, or at least dressing like you might take part in them, has become highly fashionable. Trainers, once the preserve of runners and teens, are now commonplace in many offices, and women are as likely as their male peers to own an array of sports shoes for different occasions. \u201cThe trainer has become a big fashion item. Women have trainer wardrobes and there is a section that are following product drops and limited editions in the way men have done for years,\u201d says Lorna Hall, director of retail at trends insight firm WGSN. Founded in 1981 by John Wardle and David Makin \u2013 the J and D behind the name \u2013 with a single store in Bury, the retailer has been well placed to capitalise on that shift as it has had big brand trainers at its core from day one. The self-styled \u201cking of trainers\u201d is completely at home with the labels that are currently sought after, because the trend has its origins in the 1980s and 1990s, when JD grew up. \u201cIt has the history and heritage to be credible,\u201d says Hall. Meanwhile men, who make up the majority of JD\u2019s shoppers, have become much more interested in fashion \u2013 with the UK market for menswear booming by 30% since 2013 to an expected \u00a316.1bn this year, according to Mintel. Its understanding of fashion and focus on small snappy stores have helped it fend off the might of Mike Ashley\u2019s Sports Direct, which has rubbed many rivals into the dust with its mix of discounted big brands and cheap own-labels. Strong relationships with the big labels, where Sports Direct has a more troubled history, have ensured JD gets the latest releases and exclusives on trainers and other sportswear. As Naza Linton, a 34-year-old regular shopper outside the Holloway Road store, points out, there is little competition in the market. \u201cThey are really only in competition against themselves and maybe Footlocker.

A few players, like Duggan, Parris and Taylor, looked a bit sluggish, and none of those perhaps on the fringes of the team presented a hugely compelling case to be included against Scotland next Sunday. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf282ef8f087dd73466c051\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T13:51:59.044Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Full-time: England 0-1 New Zealand</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Peeeeeeeeep. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"335e181b576567eb2d2ea08e41af61851a7ee56e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/335e181b576567eb2d2ea08e41af61851a7ee56e/0_0_3763_2509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ali Riley and Rebekah Stott both of New Zealand celebrate at the final whistle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ali Riley and Rebekah Stott both of New Zealand celebrate at the final whistle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Bardens/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T13:58:35.663Z\">at 2.58pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cf282ca8f087dd73466c050\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T13:51:40.828Z\">2.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 mins +4: </strong>Greenwood hoops over a terrific cross from deep on the left but it goes right in the middle of two England attackers and it\u2019s cleared. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf282628f08d4e6b70dc31b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T13:50:03.113Z\">2.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 mins +2: </strong>Chance has a...erm...chance for New Zealand, but slips over just as she shoots and sends it wide. </p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cf282048f082f7da1f2bed1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-01T13:48:30.101Z\">2.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>90 mins: </strong>The ball breaks to Stanway on the edge of the box but by the time she takes her shot she\u2019s slightly off-balance, and hoofs it over.

Phil Neville has been keen to mix things up a bit, to give as many players as possible a go so as to make sure everyone\u2019s on their toes ahead of the World Cup, something made all the more convincing by the fact few know what England\u2019s first-choice starting XI will be, the midfield in particular basically being three names thrown in the air and landing in whatever arrangement lands. There is a sense that there are genuinely players who have a chance of breaking into the team, or cementing their places...or perhaps that\u2019s just what Neville wants us/them to think. </p> <p><strong>\u201cI have trust in every single one of my players,\u201d</strong> said Neville. \u201cThat means there are 23 players available for selection tomorrow and fighting for a place against Scotland, Argentina and Japan. They know their value and know their profile in certain positions and certain games that will help us become successful.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Will this game offer any clues to his first-choice team?</strong> Does he even have a first-choice team? It will be a slightly curious occasion, a game which everyone would rather not be playing and where everyone is mainly trying not to get injured while at the same time attempting to make a good impression.

      "bodyText": "Here\u2019s Suzy Wrack\u2019s report from the Amex. That\u2019s enough from me: farewell, and we\u2019ll see you again soon. England have now lost two of their last four games, without scoring in each of those, against teams they should theoretically beat. Again, these are just friendlies, and this is still a squad stacked with talent, but it may well be a concern. Here\u2019s a wild swing at a possible team to face Scotland: Bardsley: Bronze, Houghton, Bright, Greenwood; Scott, Walsh; Carney, Kirby, Parris; Taylor. Of course I could be, and probably am wrong. Phil Neville speaks: \u201cIt was frustrating. I thought we played some really good football but we found it difficult to break them down. I think the disappointing thing is we have an unbelievable crowd here and we didn\u2019t get the result to send us off. Certain players needed to play minutes, and I needed to see certain combinations in different areas. All along that was our plan and a bad result isn\u2019t going to change that. Today was a jolt. We got punished, and that\u2019s what happens sometimes in football.\u201d Hmmmm. What to make of that? Ultimately the result has no tangible importance and England dominated possession, often playing some nice stuff, particularly after Carney came on. But they not only didn\u2019t get a goal, they didn\u2019t really create many clear chances, and that will surely be the biggest concern. A few players, like Duggan, Parris and Taylor, looked a bit sluggish, and none of those perhaps on the fringes of the team presented a hugely compelling case to be included against Scotland next Sunday. Peeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +4: Greenwood hoops over a terrific cross from deep on the left but it goes right in the middle of two England attackers and it\u2019s cleared. 90 mins +2: Chance has a...erm...chance for New Zealand, but slips over just as she shoots and sends it wide. 90 mins: The ball breaks to Stanway on the edge of the box but by the time she takes her shot she\u2019s slightly off-balance, and hoofs it over. Four minutes of added time to come. 88 mins: Scott slides a pass through to White, but Erceg is there again to tackle. Georgia Stanway comes on to replace White. 86 mins: England attack down the right, as Ellen White does well to dig out a cross, but it\u2019s headed behind at the near-post by Erceg. Play then stops as Moore goes down, possibly with a knock to the bonce. 83 mins: Substitution for New Zealand: Bott is off, Paige Satchell is on. 82 mins: Kirby spread s a nice pass for Mead, who pops up on the left. She tries to dribble into the box but is tackled well by Stott. 81 mins: A bit of a lull in the game. Neville looks pensive on the sidelines. 77 mins: Carney tries to lollipop her way into the box from the left, but loses control a little clumsily. That, however, is probably the first thing she\u2019s got wrong since coming on: she\u2019s been excellent, and while this isn\u2019t exactly news, she\u2019s made a case to start next weekend. 76 mins: England have a couple of corners and I can\u2019t quite work out if the deliveries are bad or they were just unlucky: either way, they fell to places where England players weren\u2019t, and were cleared. 75 mins: Subapalooza: Ellen White is on, and Jodie Taylor is off. 73 mins: Subs for New Zealand: Rosie White and Betsy Hassett off, Olivia Chance and Annalie Longo on. 71 mins: More good play from England, as first Taylor breaks behind the defence but a couple of slightly askew passes forces them to play it back and start again. Carney gets down the left, clips the ball to the back post where Scott arrives with a header, but the angle was too tight and it goes wide. 70 mins: A rare sloppy pass from Houghton gives White a chance to shoot, but she scoops it a little and sends the effort way over the bar. 68 mins: Double change for England: on come Beth Mead and Jill Scott, replacing Parris and Staniforth. 67 mins: Terrific play by England and Carney is at the centre of it again. She twists and turns, leaving a defender on her arse, before playing to Taylor, she lays off to Kirby who flicks it over the top back to Carney, but her shot at the near-post is saved by Nayler. 66 mins: Carney tries a shot from an ambitious range, but a little too ambitious and it sails over. 64 mins: Sub for New Zealand, as the goalscorer Gregorius is replaced by Hannah Wilkinson. 62 mins: A corner for New Zealand, which eventually drops to Stott at the back stick, she hits a half-volley towards goal but Bronze does well to block. 60 mins: Carney has made a difference since coming on. She collects the ball on the edge of the box, and smartly takes her time before shifting it square to Walsh, who shoots but without enough power and it\u2019s saved. 58 mins: A band - I confess I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s that England band - has been playing for a lot of the game, and has now broken into a version of \u2018Whole Again\u2019 by Atomic Kitten. Absolutely not. 56 mins: Ali Riley goes into the book for absolutely ploughing through Parris, and bafflingly complains at enough length that she was in danger of an immediate second booking. A bold strategy. 55 mins: Carney makes an immediate impact with an absolutely superb reverse pass, threading the needle between two defenders to give Kirby the chance to cross, which she does and it\u2019s deflected behind. 54 mins: Sub for England, with Toni Duggan - who has been quiet, but Neville has also been keen to conserve her energy after a long season with Barcelona - is replaced by Karen Carney. 52 mins: England really only have themselves to blame for this. They try to get straight back into it as Staniforth attempts an ambitious shot from a free-kick on the left corner of the area, but it goes just over the bar. 50 mins: And there you have it. Absolutely against the run of play, England go behind after not making the most of their possession. Greenwood doesn\u2019t get enough on a headed clearance, it falls to Rosie White who shoots, it takes a slight deflection off McManus which messes with Telford a bit, and she spills it into the path of Gregorious. The forward, who has basically been a passenger so far, jumps all over it and slams the rebound home. Well then. 48 mins: Another corner for England, another iffy delivery. It\u2019s eventually brought back to Greewood, but she skims a pass down the left - I think meant for Duggan - out of play. 46 mins: England are on the attack straight away and win a corner, but again the delivery isn\u2019t great and it\u2019s cleared at the near post. The players are back out for the second half. Don\u2019t think there are any changes as yet... A little tricky to know what to make of that. England have quite obviously been the better team but haven\u2019t scored and actually haven\u2019t created too many clear chances either, despite some incredibly altruistic defending by New Zealand. Maybe Neville doesn\u2019t care, and this is just a run out, but a goal or two would be nice. Peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins + 1: That New Zealand player is Rosie White, who seemed to get a bang on the head. Quite rightly everyone is very conscious of that sort of thing, but she seems OK to continue. 45 mins: A chance for New Zealand! My days. They\u2019re helped out when a shot hammers into Houghton\u2019s stomach and takes her out completely, but the ball breaks to Hassett who shoots left-footed, but Telford - a complete spectator to this point - does well to stay alert and tip over the bar. One minute of stoppage time to be played, although that might be more as a New Zealand player needs some treatment. 43 mins: Greenwood plays a lovely pass down the left channel that seemingly causes Stott to have an existential crisis and tumble to the turf, but Duggan just can\u2019t keep the thing in play. 42 mins: More neat passing for England, as Kirby, Parris and Bronze combine down the right side of the box, but again the attack breaks down when Staniforth\u2019s backheel is blocked. 41 mins: White leaves one on Kirby, who objects to the foul very vocally, as if someone had just reached over and taken some chips off her plate. The free kick is given. 39 mins: England are given a chance when a New Zealand clearance hits Bott square in the face and rebounds to Kirby, but she can\u2019t take advantage. Again, a decent chance donated to England isn\u2019t taken. 36 mins: Again, England create a half chance, some neat work by Kirby and Parris leads to the Lyon-bound winger trying a curler from the left side of the box, but again it sails high and wide. 34 mins: That corner is cleared, but it finds its way back into the box where McManus, who had stayed up top, is just denied by a tackle from CJ Bott, who sounds like a PI in a film from the 1950s. 33 mins: Jonathan Pearce is the commentator, and it is slightly difficult to hear him without recalling his extended riff on the price of wet wipes during the last World Cup. Anyway, England have a corner. 30 mins: Bronze barrels into the box from the right and wins a corner, Greenwood flings it into the middle but it\u2019s headed clear. I genuinely can\u2019t remember the last time New Zealand were in England\u2019s half. 28 mins: New Zealand create more problems where there were none with some poor passing. Again, this is partly down to England\u2019s pressing, but the ball finds its way to Taylor who hits a cross-shot that ends up being neither, and is cleared. 25 mins: Everyone uses Betsy Hassett receiving some treatment on an ankle knock as a chance to have a drink. Everyone takes a good slug from the Gatorade bottles. I\u2019m sweating just watching them play in this sunshine. 23 mins: After a short corner didn\u2019t entirely work, the ball comes back out to Greenwood on the right who whips in a left-footed cross. It falls to Parris, who aims for the top corner but skews it wide, the effort fading left when it needed to curl right. 21 mins: Given this is a friendly you probably can\u2019t really classify it as a \u2018concern\u2019, but England might be slightly worried not to have taken advantage of both this dominance of possession and territory, and the clownish defending on display. Parris and Duggan haven\u2019t really got into the game yet from the flanks. 19 mins: More nice play from England as Taylor and Kirby combine, and the latter opens out her body to try curling in a shot from the left side of the area, but doesn\u2019t get nearly enough power on the shot and it\u2019s easily saved. 16 mins: Incidentally, the replays of that penalty claim in the 9th minute suggest it should certainly have been a spot kick. Taylor\u2019s shins were taken out by the keeper, otherwise she would\u2019ve been in. 15 mins: This New Zealand defence might as well be soundtracked with a swannee whistle. Yet another ludicrous pass - this time from Bowen, I think - along the ground, back into their own crowded penalty area, is jumped all over by Taylor who tries to clip over the keeper, but Nayler does well to dive at her feet and smother the chance. 14 mins: Another chance for England as Taylor absolutely rinses Moore for pace, she takes it around the keeper but nobody could keep up with her so her cut-back was mopped up by that wheezing defence. Erceg hoofs clear with the urgency of someone throwing a hand grenade out of a house. 12 mins: Sloppy as New Zealand have been with their passing at the back, England have made sure they\u2019re in the position to capitalise on those mistakes. On the touchline, Neville seems keen to ensure the energy is high, that the players don\u2019t slack even when taking throw-ins. 9 mins: More circus defending from New Zealand lets Taylor in. She takes a slightly heavy touch, tries to go round the keeper but goes to ground, with a hint of a foul from Nayler before the striker can get the shot away. No penalty given, and there\u2019s no real protests of note either. 7 mins: England look lively so far. The passing is crisp, the movement is sharp. They get a free-kick out on the left, which is played short to Kirby who clips it into the box where Taylor flicks the header on, but straight at the keeper. 5 mins: Ooof, very nearly a calamity for New Zealand, as Moore underhits a backpass and Nayler is slow to come off her line: not a brilliant combo, and the scuttling Fran Kirby very nearly gets in to nick the ball, but the keeper eventually lumbers into the correct position and clears. Nayler miscontrolled a pass just before that too: nerves? Uncertainty? A sense they\u2019d rather be kicking back on the beach with a beer? 3 mins: Bronze tries to clip a pass from deep on the right over the top, looking for the run of Taylor, but it\u2019s just too far ahead of her. 1 min: New Zealand kick off, and knock it around at the back a bit. England stand off initially but press when they advance up the field a bit more. Someone in the crowd has a drum, which may get trying. The players are out. Football is about to happen. Get involved. England assistant Bev Priestman is being interviewed by the BBC, and she sort of suggests that this team won\u2019t be the one to start against Scotland, at least partly because they don\u2019t want to give any of their opponents a look at what that team might be. It is worth remembering that Neville has never named an unchanged team, so none of this is a particular surprise. It looks bloody glorious at the Amex, by the way. Sun shining on the south coast, beautiful pitch, full house: magic. And here\u2019s Suzanne\u2019s interview with Georgia Stanway, on the bench today but who should still play a good part in the tournament ahead. At 16 Georgia Stanway upped sticks to pursue football. \u201c\u2018Not many people leave Barrow\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s what\u2019s said,\u201d says the forward. But that is what it took. And now, at 20, she is the youngest member of Phil Neville\u2019s squad for the World Cup. She is no shock inclusion nor is she along for the ride. Stanway is determined to feature and will likely get game time in France. But England, though. Here\u2019s Suzanne Wrack\u2019s scene-setter for the game ahead today: While this is the last chance for some of the squad players to give their manager a starting XI selection headache, Neville has been frustrated with this latest round of friendlies and is desperate for the tournament to begin. \u201cWe\u2019ve prepared for them for so long now that the talking is over,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s just get out to France. There\u2019s nothing more we can do on the training ground with them. They\u2019re prepared, they understand the system, they have a clarity of everything.\u201d The Heraf affair turned pretty ugly, all in. The Austrian coach was accused of assorted sorts of bullying, intimidation and other forms of highly unprofessional behaviour, with no fewer than 12 players sending letters to NZ Football outlining concerns. He denied it all, claiming that the players simply couldn\u2019t handle his \u201cEuropean\u201d style of management and basically that they were a bunch of great big softies. What of New Zealand, then. Well, they got absolutely hosed by the USA a few weeks ago, losing 5-0 but a 2-1 win over Mexico not long after that might have settled nerves a little. In any case, things are better than they were a year ago, when half the team refused to play under former head coach Andreas Heraf because of, among other things, his tactics that made Jose Mourinho look like Zdenek Zemen. \u201cYou can see how I couldn\u2019t stand to wear that fern on my chest any more when his vision was to cower in a corner and not get beat by too much,\u201d said Abby Erceg, the former captain and one of the players who chose no international football over Heraf\u2019s international football. However, since former USA and Australia coach Tom Sermanni took over last year, things have looked up rather, and they secured qualifications with a series of batterings over the admittedly modest competition in Oceania. They actually have one more warm-up game after this, against Wales on Tuesday, before their tournament starts against the Netherlands a week later. So that looks like Lucy Bronze will play at right-back, with Fran Kirby just behind Jodie Taylor in a 4-2-3-1. Jill Scott is on the bench, while Demi Stokes, Jade Moore and Rachel Daly are the three members of the squad not on the bench at all. England Telford; Bronze, Houghton, McManus, Greenwood; Staniforth, Walsh; Parris, Kirby, Duggan; Taylor. Subs: Bardsley, Brighton, Scott, Williamson, White, Stanway, Carney, Mean, Roebuck, Blundell. New Zealand Nayler; Percival, Erceg, Bott, Moore, Stott, Riley, Gregorius, Hassett, White, Bowen. Subs: Esson, Olla, Green, Kete, Longo, Morton, Duncan, Wilkinson, Skilton, Satchell, Cleverley, Chance. Here we go then. One more tune-up before the big dance. The general vibe about all of these games ahead of a big tournament is that the players would rather be doing anything else, itching to get started with the actual important stuff, which in England\u2019s case is a week tomorrow against Scotland in Nice. But this one might actually mean something. Phil Neville has been keen to mix things up a bit, to give as many players as possible a go so as to make sure everyone\u2019s on their toes ahead of the World Cup, something made all the more convincing by the fact few know what England\u2019s first-choice starting XI will be, the midfield in particular basically being three names thrown in the air and landing in whatever arrangement lands. There is a sense that there are genuinely players who have a chance of breaking into the team, or cementing their places...or perhaps that\u2019s just what Neville wants us/them to think. \u201cI have trust in every single one of my players,\u201d said Neville. \u201cThat means there are 23 players available for selection tomorrow and fighting for a place against Scotland, Argentina and Japan. They know their value and know their profile in certain positions and certain games that will help us become successful.\u201d Will this game offer any clues to his first-choice team? Does he even have a first-choice team? It will be a slightly curious occasion, a game which everyone would rather not be playing and where everyone is mainly trying not to get injured while at the same time attempting to make a good impression. Should be interesting, at least. Stick around. Kick-off: 13.00 BST.",

      "bodyText": "Sir Philip Green\u2019s retail empire faces a crunch meeting with creditors this week as it tries to avert a collapse into administration which could put 18,000 jobs at risk. The group, which operates 570 shops, must win approval from 75% of its creditors, most of whom are landlords, for a restructuring which will enable it to close at least 23 stores and cut rents by up to 70% on nearly 200 more. A further 25 UK stores are set to close as Arcadia puts the property holding companies of Miss Selfridge and Evans into administration. It is also closing 11 Topshop stores in the US. The deal, which will be subject to a vote on Wednesday, also relies on reaching an agreement with the Pensions Regulator over funding of Arcadia\u2019s pension deficit, which is valued at up to \u00a3750m. The regulator, which has legal powers to force Arcadia and Green to ensure its pension is properly funded, wants a further \u00a350m on top of the \u00a3360m over three years that has been put on the table. Arcadia\u2019s future will be decided as Green faces a new personal battle, after being charged with four counts of misdemeanour assault in the US, after a pilates instructor alleged he repeatedly touched her inappropriately, according to authorities in Arizona. Pima County\u2019s deputy county attorney, Lauren Deakin, said the Arcadia boss had been formally charged with four counts of \u201cknowingly touching another person with the intent to injure, insult, or provoke\u201d. Green denies the claims. Each charge carries a potential sentence of up to 30 days in the Pima County jail, a fine of not more than $500, and up to one year of probation. Green, who has not been in the UK since October, is due to appear in court in Tucson on 19 June, according to court filings. In a bid to reassure Arcadia employees about their future, chief executive Ian Grabiner told staff in an email seen by the Observer that the management team had a \u201cclear plan in place\u201d to take on increased competition from both high street and online rivals backed by \u00a3135m of investment. This includes \u00a375m on a new hi- tech distribution centre in Daventry and a step up in wholesale sales, including taking Topshop onto fashion retailer Asos\u2019s online platform for the first time. The company has also pledged \u00a360m to upgrade its online operations. Sofie Willmott, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said the online investment was badly needed to ensure Topshop kept pace with the latest search tools and delivery options that many of its peers already offered. \u201cIt will now be even more important that the brands\u2019 websites stand up to Asos\u2019s best-in-class proposition,\u201d she said. In the email, Grabiner said: \u201cI am confident that we can succeed in securing the future of the business but it is dependent on the backing of our landlords, the pension trustees, the Pension Protection Fund and the [Pensions Regulator].\u201d The proposal for Arcadia\u2019s restructuring, an insolvency procedure known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), sets out the parlous state Arcadia finds itself in. The group was making nearly \u00a3220m in underlying profits three years ago. In the document, Arcadia says it can no longer afford its \u00a3170m annual rent bill for its leased stores. Despite slashing \u00a370m from its cost base in the last two years, it said it was not able to resolve its \u201csignificant financial difficulties\u201d. If the CVA does not go ahead, Arcadia has said it is \u201chighly likely, either immediately or after a short time period, to enter into insolvent administration or liquidation\u201d. More than one landlord told the Observer they had yet to decide whether they would back the CVA. Green has promised landlords a 20% stake in the business and a \u00a340m compensation fund in an effort to secure their backing. He also pledged to make a \u00a350m cash investment in updating stores and online sales infrastructure at Arcadia \u2013 a sum which underpins the group\u2019s \u00a3135m turnaround plan.",

It has taken them 16 hours of precise, painstaking work to remove it from a 31-year-old female donor, who had died three days earlier. A few seconds after photographer <a href=\"https://www.lynnjohnsonphoto.com/\" title=\"\">Lynn Johnson</a> captured this extraordinary moment, plastic surgeons in the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, began the second phase of a procedure that lasted around 30 hours in total. When it was completed, 21 year-old Katie Stubblefield became the youngest person to receive a successful full face transplant.</p> <p>Taken in 2017 as part of a bigger series documenting Stubblefield\u2019s groundbreaking surgical transformation, <em>Katie\u2019s </em><em>New </em><em>Face</em> (2017) is one of several arresting images that have made the shortlist for the <a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/wellcome-photography-prize/2019\" title=\"\">2019 Wellcome Photography </a><a href=\"https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/wellcome-photography-prize/2019\" title=\"\">prize</a>.

It could be mistaken at first glance for a signature work by the conceptual land artist Christo, famous for his wrapping of monumental buildings and stretches of landscape in fabric. It is, in fact, an attempt by environmentalists to slow down the melting of the Swiss glacier, the heavy thermal material reflecting heat and light that would otherwise destroy the ice. It is an image of an undertaking that seems both surreal and slightly desperate, but the ecological context is calamitous: the Rh\u00f4ne Glacier has lost 350 metres (1,150ft) in ice thickness since 1856 and around 40 metres in the last decade alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"145e2c41fd2d679ee92bb908671b7c7a061905e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/145e2c41fd2d679ee92bb908671b7c7a061905e4/0_0_7360_4912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Zora the Robot Care-Giver, 2018, Dmitry Kostyukov \" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Zora the Robot Care-Giver, 2018, Dmitry Kostyukov. </strong>This woman in a nursing facility outside Paris has developed an emotional attachment to Zora the robot.

The single image from it included here gives you a sense of its almost ghostly intimacy. Entitled <em>The Morgue</em>, and shot in Colombia in 2017, it is a multiple exposure of one of the young people who are trained to, as Cano puts it, \u201csalvage the beauty of the deceased, that those who love them can always remember them\u201d. Like his fellow students, this young man is being trained in postmortem techniques to erase the scars and wounds of violent death so that the victims of Colombia\u2019s prolonged paramilitary-fuelled violence can be viewed by their relatives.</p> <p>Among the several captured moments of intimacy on display in the shortlist, perhaps the strangest is by <a href=\"https://dmitrykostyukov.com/\" title=\"\">Dmitry Kostyukov</a>.

      "bodyText": "A human face lies inert on a surgical tray as if staring up at the team of doctors hovering over it. It has taken them 16 hours of precise, painstaking work to remove it from a 31-year-old female donor, who had died three days earlier. A few seconds after photographer Lynn Johnson captured this extraordinary moment, plastic surgeons in the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, began the second phase of a procedure that lasted around 30 hours in total. When it was completed, 21 year-old Katie Stubblefield became the youngest person to receive a successful full face transplant. Taken in 2017 as part of a bigger series documenting Stubblefield\u2019s groundbreaking surgical transformation, Katie\u2019s New Face (2017) is one of several arresting images that have made the shortlist for the 2019 Wellcome Photography prize. The aim of the award is to celebrate \u201ccompelling imagery that captures stories of health, medicine and science\u201d. Composed of four categories \u2013 Social Perspectives, Hidden Worlds, Medicine in Focus and Outbreaks \u2013 the shortlist perhaps predictably favours documentary and photojournalism. There are some surprises, though, not least the often beautiful abstractions of David Linstead\u2019s microscopic image of the capillaries of a human fingertip that had been injected with red ink. Katie\u2019s New Face, 2017, Lynn Johnson. At the age of 21, Katie became the youngest person ever to receive a full- face transplant. This was the critical moment after the donor\u2019s face was surgically removed before being transferred onto Katie. There was complete silence in the room as the surgical team absorbed the gravity of their mission. The transformational procedure took over 30 hours and was undertaken by a team of around 30 medical professionals at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. From its inception, photography has been utilised to illuminate the mysteries of science and medicine, with Victorian pioneers such as Henry Fox Talbot and Auguste Adolphe Bertsch creating microscopic studies of insects and plants that often resembled ornate line drawings. As the category Hidden Worlds shows, that tradition of cutting-edge experimentation continues apace with an advanced image-mapping of HIV infection undertaken by a team of research scientists that allows us to see four representations of the same cluster of 100,000 cells from a rhesus monkey. Shroud, Rh\u00f4ne Glacier, 2018, Simon Norfolk and Klaus Thymann In the Rh\u00f4ne glacier in the Swiss Alps, a family runs an ice grotto as a popular tourist attraction. But, as the Earth warms, the glacier is shrinking and the grotto is under threat \u2013 an unusual example of how climate change imperils people\u2019s livelihoods. In response, the family has covered part of the glacier with white geosynthetic blankets to reflect away the sun\u2019s heat and keep the cold in. This slows the shrinkage, but it is only a small-scale, temporary fix. In the same section, Simon Norfolk and Klaus Thymann\u2019s man-altered landscape Shroud, Rh\u00f4ne Glacier, shows the range of approaches and the breadth of subject matter that the prize celebrates. It could be mistaken at first glance for a signature work by the conceptual land artist Christo, famous for his wrapping of monumental buildings and stretches of landscape in fabric. It is, in fact, an attempt by environmentalists to slow down the melting of the Swiss glacier, the heavy thermal material reflecting heat and light that would otherwise destroy the ice. It is an image of an undertaking that seems both surreal and slightly desperate, but the ecological context is calamitous: the Rh\u00f4ne Glacier has lost 350 metres (1,150ft) in ice thickness since 1856 and around 40 metres in the last decade alone. Zora the Robot Care-Giver, 2018, Dmitry Kostyukov This woman in a nursing facility outside Paris has developed an emotional attachment to Zora the robot. There are at least 15 of these robots currently in use in healthcare settings in France, and more around the world, including Australia, the US and elsewhere in Europe. Controlled remotely by a nurse, Zora can help people with communication and provide comfort and entertainment (including exercise classes). Some people respond very positively to interacting with Zora, others ignore it completely. Sex and death inevitably feature and, again, it is in the Hidden Worlds category where the contrast is most dramatic. Simone Cerio\u2019s wonderfully tender and intimate series, Love Givers, is represented by a single understated image of two semi-naked women lying on a bed. Shot from above, it suggests the casual intimacy of longterm lovers, but one of them, Debora, is the first officially sanctioned sexual assistant in Italy, whose role is \u201cto support disabled people to explore intimate practices\u201d. Love Givers, 2013, Simone Cerio Debora is the first sexual assistant in Italy supporting disabled people (male and female) to explore intimate practices. Repression of sexual instincts can cause psychological stress, and this can particularly affect those who are not able to use their bodies fully. By providing physical contact of the right kind in a safe environment, a trained professional can improve a person\u2019s wellbeing, increase self-esteem, and prepare them for future intimate relationships. Cerio has described her project as \u201ca physical and mental journey\u201d that challenges our perception of the disabled and their most intimate needs. \u201cSexual assistance is a technique of psychophysical approach to disabled people, based on massages, kisses, visual contacts and erotic stimulation,\u201d she elaborates on her Facebook page, \u201cThis project is an opportunity, perhaps the only way for disabled people to have such an experience.\u201d The Morgue, 2017 Luis Henry Agudelo Cano In a country with high rates of violent crime, many young people in Colombia choose to study forensic sciences or embalming. They seek to discover the identities of the many unknown bodies that arrive at the morgue in the hope that they can then be returned to their families. This busy university teaching morgue in Medelli\u0301n also doubles as the judicial morgue when the civil service is on strike. Luis Henry Agudelo Cano has already won second place in the current affairs and news category of the 2018 Sony world photography awards for his black and white series Young People Who Beautify Death. The single image from it included here gives you a sense of its almost ghostly intimacy. Entitled The Morgue, and shot in Colombia in 2017, it is a multiple exposure of one of the young people who are trained to, as Cano puts it, \u201csalvage the beauty of the deceased, that those who love them can always remember them\u201d. Like his fellow students, this young man is being trained in postmortem techniques to erase the scars and wounds of violent death so that the victims of Colombia\u2019s prolonged paramilitary-fuelled violence can be viewed by their relatives. Among the several captured moments of intimacy on display in the shortlist, perhaps the strangest is by Dmitry Kostyukov. His portrait of an elderly resident of a nursery facility near Paris is tenderly observed, but it challenges all our received notions of what constitutes care and, indeed, tenderness. The woman is cradling Zora, a robot remotely controlled by a nurse as an aid to \u201ccommunication, comfort and entertainment\u201d of the residents. Many of them ignore Zora, while others take her to their hearts as they would a child.

There is also a glazed sitting area that juts out into the garden. \u201cI had never lived open-plan before,\u201d says Stevinson, whose Victorian home of 35 years was similar in size to this house. \u201cThe arrangement was much more vertical and by the time the children had all left home I was using two, maximum three, of the rooms. Here, I use every bit of the living space, but I never feel that I\u2019m rattling around.\u201d</p> <p>To further mitigate this scenario, the architects placed the three guest bedrooms in the north wing of the house, which can be shut off with a sliding partition when they are not in use. The idea is that when friends, or her children and grandchildren, are staying, Stevinson has her own sanctuary, a master suite on the level above. Next to this is a fourth guest bedroom which she uses as an artist\u2019s studio. \u201cI like to dabble,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I am by no means a great painter.\u201d</p> <p>Her love of art is witnessed in the bold canvases that hang on the walls, a number of which are by northern landscape artist Peter M Hicks. Also key to the decoration is a painterly floral fabric that was used for the curtains and pops up again on cushions and a window seat, as well as the sofa in the master bedroom. \u201cThe flowers seem to work with all the vegetation outside,\u201d observes Stevinson, who picked out the different hues in the print in order to create a punchy feature wall in each space. \u201cI was careful to limit the colour to small areas \u2013 I didn\u2019t want the interiors to compete with the views.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dcaa978601958ffbe182d363fa3af4e9717ce96b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcaa978601958ffbe182d363fa3af4e9717ce96b/0_130_7263_4624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is something different to look at everywhere you turn\u2019: outside living.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"637\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is something different to look at everywhere you turn\u2019: outside living.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroline Mardon/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Only a few select antiques made it in from Stevinson\u2019s former home, and instead she has favoured modern seating by Italian brand <a href=\"http://www.natuzzi.co.uk/collection.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI0JCkk4et4gIVbb7tCh2S9gW2EAAYASAAEgLLmvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" title=\"\">Natuzzi</a>, 20th-century classics purchased at the <a href=\"https://modernshows.com/\" title=\"\">Midcentury Modern</a> show at Dulwich College and bespoke designs crafted in sycamore and burr walnut. \u201cA friend of mine lives in Yorkshire and she took me to some wonderful furniture workshops up there; one of the companies ended up making my kitchen,\u201d she adds.</p> <p>For Stevinson, though, her favourite project has been the challenge of taming the once-wild garden. \u201cI really got into gardening later in life and now I am obsessed with it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m away, I really miss it.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://www.alma-nac.com/\" title=\"\">alma-nac.com</a></em></p>",

The kitchen flows into the main living space but the room doesn\u2019t feel cavernous, thanks to a large fireplace that divides the two areas. There is also a glazed sitting area that juts out into the garden. \u201cI had never lived open-plan before,\u201d says Stevinson, whose Victorian home of 35 years was similar in size to this house. \u201cThe arrangement was much more vertical and by the time the children had all left home I was using two, maximum three, of the rooms. Here, I use every bit of the living space, but I never feel that I\u2019m rattling around.\u201d To further mitigate this scenario, the architects placed the three guest bedrooms in the north wing of the house, which can be shut off with a sliding partition when they are not in use. The idea is that when friends, or her children and grandchildren, are staying, Stevinson has her own sanctuary, a master suite on the level above. Next to this is a fourth guest bedroom which she uses as an artist\u2019s studio. \u201cI like to dabble,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I am by no means a great painter.\u201d Her love of art is witnessed in the bold canvases that hang on the walls, a number of which are by northern landscape artist Peter M Hicks. Also key to the decoration is a painterly floral fabric that was used for the curtains and pops up again on cushions and a window seat, as well as the sofa in the master bedroom. \u201cThe flowers seem to work with all the vegetation outside,\u201d observes Stevinson, who picked out the different hues in the print in order to create a punchy feature wall in each space. \u201cI was careful to limit the colour to small areas \u2013 I didn\u2019t want the interiors to compete with the views.\u201d Only a few select antiques made it in from Stevinson\u2019s former home, and instead she has favoured modern seating by Italian brand Natuzzi, 20th-century classics purchased at the Midcentury Modern show at Dulwich College and bespoke designs crafted in sycamore and burr walnut. \u201cA friend of mine lives in Yorkshire and she took me to some wonderful furniture workshops up there; one of the companies ended up making my kitchen,\u201d she adds. For Stevinson, though, her favourite project has been the challenge of taming the once-wild garden. \u201cI really got into gardening later in life and now I am obsessed with it,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I\u2019m away, I really miss it.\u201d alma-nac.com",

And it always works a treat. The land of crags, castles and bards stirs a particular kind of English sensibility, one perpetually prone to wistful nostalgia for simpler times, simpler places.</p> <p>Inevitably, this escapist appeal is sharpened at times of crisis or bewildering change. Continental slaughter and rapid industrialisation at the end of the 18th century gave birth to the first wave of \u201cpicturesque\u201d tourism, with Wales the destination of choice.</p> <p>In they poured, clutching volumes by William Gilpin or Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who had found \u201cthe wild-wood scenery\u201d of Wales \u201cmost sublimely terrible\u201d, surpassing \u201ceverything I could have conceived\u201d.

All too often, from the disappointment comes fury.</p> <p>This, too, is a long tradition. Poet Walter Savage Landor, wowed by the estates built in picturesque style across Wales, breezed into the Black Mountains in 1807, determined to create his own.

On his departure from Llanthony, Landor fired off an angry letter to the Bishop of St David\u2019s: \u201cIf drunkenness, idleness, mischief and revenge are the principle characteristics of the savage state, what nation\u2026 in the world is so singularly tattooed with them as the Welsh?\u201d</p> <p>Over the past half century, the trickle of English idealists escaping to Wales has become a torrent. Godfather of them all was John Seymour, author of bestsellers <em>The Fat of the Land</em> and <em>The </em><em>Complete Book of Self-Sufficiency</em>, who bought a farm in Pembrokeshire in 1964: \u201cI was back in a peasant society where people still brewed beer and killed pigs and we were no longer freaks,\u201d he wrote.

Gemma Arterton is in black leather trousers, chatting to fellow actor Gemma Chan, who is in a floor-length gown. The River Caf\u00e9\u2019s Ruth Rogers is in a dress the same hot pink as the peonies that fill the tables. Kate Moss is squished cosily between Kors and his husband Lance LePere, sipping sparkling water \u2013 she\u2019s teetotal these days \u2013 but the Ruinart champagne is flowing for pretty much everyone else. There are platters of soft clouds of burrata, slivers of ruby-rare steak, and Jenga stacks of triple-cooked chips. And then the doors burst open to reveal a white-robed gospel choir, belting out the O Jays\u2019 classic Love Train.

It\u2019s better than a facelift!\u201d It is the morning after, and Kors is holding court on a midcentury sofa on the fourth floor of the Georgian townhouse which is his new flagship at the smart end of Bond Street, just across from the Ritz and Fortnum\u2019s. The walnut coffee table is laid with white peonies, chocolate truffles, and tumblers of iced water. \u201cPeople think of chic as something that\u2019s quite serious, but it\u2019s not true. All the chicest women I have ever known have had a great sense of humour. Like Kate [Moss]. So chic! And she loves to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Kors, a billionaire since 2014, was born 59 years ago into a suburban family in Long Island. Glitz ran through his veins from the start. As a toddler he appeared in adverts for Lucky Charms cereal; aged five, he helped his mother design her wedding dress. (\u201cThe marriage didn\u2019t last, but the pictures are timeless,\u201d he has said.) The night he graduated from high school, he skipped prom and went to Studio 54 instead. \u201cDo I remember what I was wearing? Of course I do! Two silk shirts, layered, unbuttoned to the waist. I was very skinny, I had long blond hair, I looked like Peter Frampton or Roger Daltrey. I had big Porsche sunglasses, a pair of high-waisted Ghurkha trousers, and ivory Gucci loafers. Everyone always asks, how did you get in? But I didn\u2019t know it was so hard to get in. We were young. We just walked in. And I thought \u2013 oh, wow. I\u2019m in Oz.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0563e273a4a83700ffd169e46b2eaf9868b6cb96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0563e273a4a83700ffd169e46b2eaf9868b6cb96/124_92_1439_2557/563.jpg\" alt=\"Green light: Michelle Obama wearing Michael Kors.\" width=\"563\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green light: Michelle Obama wearing Michael Kors.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Startraks/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He enrolled as a fashion student in Manhattan and took a part-time job at Lothar\u2019s, the west 57th street boutique-of-the-moment.

On a Saturday afternoon I\u2019d be helping Goldie Hawn or Diana Ross choose what to wear to go out that night.\u201d</p> <p>Four of Kors\u2019 staff members sit in the room with us for the duration of our interview, for no reason that I can discern except perhaps that Kors is happiest with an audience. He talks in anecdotes rather than answers, playing to the gallery despite the fact that his team must, presumably, have heard most of his stories before. He is a bona fide celebrity in the US, thanks to a 10-season stint as the judge on the reality show <em><a href=\"https://www.bravotv.com/project-runway\" title=\"\">Project Runway</a></em>. For his entire 38 years in fashion Kors has mined a rich seam of glamour, staying true to joie de vivre, to an upbeat emotional tone \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d he nods emphatically to this, \u201calways\u201d \u2013 while making smart enough financial decisions to be in the position he is now, with homes in London, Long Island and Florida, a favourite suite at Claridge\u2019s, his measurements held by the Savile Row tailor <a href=\"https://kilgour.com/\" title=\"\">Kilgour</a>, and a position as honorary chairman of Capri Holdings, the group which owns his label as well as Versace and Jimmy Choo.</p> <p>Aside from a stint at Celine in Paris from 1997 to 2003 \u2013 he said he stopped when they grounded Concorde, which I assumed was a joke, but then I checked out the dates and it fits, so who knows? \u2013 he has channelled his energy into building an American brand that sits right across the wingspan of fashion, from the \u00a3250 handbags you see every day on the tube in London to \u00a32,500 evening gowns in sequin-embellished georgette better suited to the red carpet. He has pulled off the trick few brands manage, which is to have a name which retains prestige in the most elite circles at the same time as being available on the mass market.</p> <p>\u201cWhy would anyone assume that just because a customer doesn\u2019t have an unlimited budget, they don\u2019t have as sophisticated an eye?\u201d he says. \u201cJust because you have a different lifestyle or a different budget, that doesn\u2019t mean your taste level is different. However much money you have, you want the best thing that you can possibly have. And you deserve to be delighted by it.\u201d That his uptown clients have remained in thrall to a name which can be purchased at a tenth of the price they pay is testament to the affection in which Kors is held. He travels endlessly, hosting lunches and shows for his customers in Miami and LA, Houston and Chicago, listening to them talk about their lives, building rapport.

      "bodyText": "It is a rainy Thursday evening in London and Michael Kors is hosting what has been billed as \u201cjust a small, low-key dinner\u201d to celebrate the opening of his new boutique. Gemma Arterton is in black leather trousers, chatting to fellow actor Gemma Chan, who is in a floor-length gown. The River Caf\u00e9\u2019s Ruth Rogers is in a dress the same hot pink as the peonies that fill the tables. Kate Moss is squished cosily between Kors and his husband Lance LePere, sipping sparkling water \u2013 she\u2019s teetotal these days \u2013 but the Ruinart champagne is flowing for pretty much everyone else. There are platters of soft clouds of burrata, slivers of ruby-rare steak, and Jenga stacks of triple-cooked chips. And then the doors burst open to reveal a white-robed gospel choir, belting out the O Jays\u2019 classic Love Train.

Her work on Broadway has ranged from <em>The Coast </em><em>of Utopia</em> to <em>Top Girls</em>. Most recently, she starred in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/23/sweat-donmar-review-lynn-nottage-the-convert-young-vic-richard-second-ii-almeida-simon-russel-beale\" title=\"\">Sweat</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/dec/23/sweat-donmar-review-lynn-nottage-the-convert-young-vic-richard-second-ii-almeida-simon-russel-beale\" title=\"\"> at the Donmar Warehouse</a>, a searingly topical play by Lynn Nottage that examines the deep-rooted discontent and anxiety that helped put Donald Trump in the White House. <em>Sweat</em> transfers to the West End next week.</p> <p><strong>Would you like to see more working-class stories like </strong><em><strong>Sweat</strong></em><strong> on our stages and screens?</strong><br>Absolutely. One of the things I love about the play is it\u2019s about people whose stories we don\u2019t usually hear or see. What is so compelling is how very human and universal the feelings are that Lynn is writing about. It\u2019s more than just a story of factory workers; it\u2019s about living in a culture of fear and being afraid of losing your place and losing control. My character, Tracey, is afraid not only of being unable to protect her job, she\u2019s afraid of losing something she identifies with so tightly that without it she feels the world is falling apart. These ideas and feelings need exploring because people all over the world, not just in Trump\u2019s America, are going through them.</p> <p><strong>When Tracey\u2019s livelihood is threatened she </strong><strong>turns hateful and racist. How does it feel portraying that side of her?</strong><br>It\u2019s challenging but it\u2019s not helpful for me to judge her. It has to be very much about just playing the play and, as with a piece of music, you need your low notes and your high notes. And with Tracey, sometimes I have to play some pretty low notes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a522d8725fd97fe1dc457196e14a072221ae5b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2a522d8725fd97fe1dc457196e14a072221ae5b4/0_333_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Martha Plimpton as Tracey with Stuart McQuarrie as Stan in Sweat.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018With Tracey, sometimes I have to play some pretty low notes\u2019: Martha Plimpton as Tracey in Sweat with Stuart McQuarrie as Stan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you prefer stage or screen?</strong><br>Right now, the more interesting parts are in the theatre, but there\u2019s lots of great stuff in television, too.</p> <p><strong>What about movies?</strong><br>Hollywood movies have no appeal for me. I rarely even go to see one \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you why. There are about five women in all Hollywood movies for a period of about three years. Then you get a new crop of five women who are allowed to make movies for the next three years and so it goes on. And the men are allowed to age but not the women. TV is more diverse and interesting and so are independent films. I like films that are made in Britain and in Europe.</p> <p><strong>You were born into an acting dynasty, the daughter of </strong><strong>Keith Carradine</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>Shelley Plimpton</strong><strong>.

      "bodyText": "Martha Plimpton is an American actor who made her name as a teenager in films such as The Mosquito Coast and Running on Empty, appearing alongside her childhood sweetheart River Phoenix. Her work on Broadway has ranged from The Coast of Utopia to Top Girls. Most recently, she starred in Sweat at the Donmar Warehouse, a searingly topical play by Lynn Nottage that examines the deep-rooted discontent and anxiety that helped put Donald Trump in the White House. Sweat transfers to the West End next week. Would you like to see more working-class stories like Sweat on our stages and screens? Absolutely. One of the things I love about the play is it\u2019s about people whose stories we don\u2019t usually hear or see. What is so compelling is how very human and universal the feelings are that Lynn is writing about. It\u2019s more than just a story of factory workers; it\u2019s about living in a culture of fear and being afraid of losing your place and losing control. My character, Tracey, is afraid not only of being unable to protect her job, she\u2019s afraid of losing something she identifies with so tightly that without it she feels the world is falling apart. These ideas and feelings need exploring because people all over the world, not just in Trump\u2019s America, are going through them. When Tracey\u2019s livelihood is threatened she turns hateful and racist. How does it feel portraying that side of her? It\u2019s challenging but it\u2019s not helpful for me to judge her. It has to be very much about just playing the play and, as with a piece of music, you need your low notes and your high notes. And with Tracey, sometimes I have to play some pretty low notes. Do you prefer stage or screen? Right now, the more interesting parts are in the theatre, but there\u2019s lots of great stuff in television, too. What about movies? Hollywood movies have no appeal for me. I rarely even go to see one \u2013 and I\u2019ll tell you why. There are about five women in all Hollywood movies for a period of about three years. Then you get a new crop of five women who are allowed to make movies for the next three years and so it goes on. And the men are allowed to age but not the women. TV is more diverse and interesting and so are independent films. I like films that are made in Britain and in Europe. You were born into an acting dynasty, the daughter of Keith Carradine and Shelley Plimpton. Was it inevitable you were going to become an actor? It was probably always going to work out this way. My parents met doing the original production of Hair in New York and I was three by the time my mom left the show, so my earliest days were spent in dressing rooms. Backstage felt like home, just a normal place to be. You could say I\u2019ve spent pretty much my whole life in theatres. I was eight years old when I first went on stage. How do you look back now on your time as a teenage movie star in films like The Goonies and Running on Empty?

But there\u2019s so much great content now on other platforms that Hollywood is quickly becoming irrelevant. How did you avoid the fate of so many child stars, who often burn out too young on drugs and alcohol? I grew up in New York and being an actor was more interesting to me, I guess. As well as an actor, you are an abortion-rights activist and founder of the pressure group A Is For. How do you feel about the recent vote in Alabama to ban abortion? Obviously, I am enraged. I am furious. I am terrified for the women of my country and the girls. Alabama\u2019s not alone.

When a bottle breaks, the crowds erupt with a chorus of \u201cmazel tov\u201d, or congratulations.</p> <p>But as some ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in traditional black suits, side locks, and thick skullcaps pass by, Ad Shamsi\u2019s face sours. \u201cWhat do they have to do here?\u201d asks the 56-year-old Jewish Israeli, who is kicking off the weekend at an outside bar.</p> <p>This is a glimpse of the intra-religious tension that in part led Israel\u2019s parliament last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/29/israel-to-hold-snap-election-after-netanyahu-coalition-talks-fail\" title=\"\">to dissolve itself and hold a fresh election</a> \u2013 just seven weeks after the last one \u2013 following a deadlock between two rightwing factions at odds over a proposal to draft the ultra-Orthodox into Israel\u2019s military.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-01T15:22:26.html\" data-alt=\"Map: Israel and the Middle East\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jun/2019-06-01T15:22:26.html\">Map: Israel and the Middle East</a> </figure>  <p>Since Israel\u2019s founding, the ultra-Orthodox \u2013 also called the Haredim \u2013 have been exempted from military service, which is mandatory for all Jewish Israeli school leavers. The various ultra-Orthodox sects see it as a religious commandment to only study Jewish texts and separate themselves from modern society. They consequently receive government subsidies to study rather than work, along with general social services and benefits relating to unemployment, poverty and their large numbers of children.</p> <p>Today the ultra-Orthodox, an umbrella term for different sects and communities, are 10% of Israel\u2019s population of more than 8.5 million \u2013 and are growing fast.</p> <p>They have strategically cultivated a role as kingmakers in Israeli politics, making or breaking coalitions based on which politicians best support their interests.</p> <p>The military symbolises the antithesis of traditional ultra-Orthodox principles. It represents time away from studying, a mixing of genders against religious prohibitions and a vast melting pot in which young people are taught to be a certain kind of Israeli. For average Jewish Israelis, to be a good citizen is to serve in the military. (Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up 20% of the population, are exempt from service because of the ongoing conflict.)</p> <p>Shamsi is an avid supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and his rightwing, national religious policies. He wears a kippa, or Jewish head covering, thinks shops should close on the Sabbath in keeping with strict Jewish law, and supports Israel\u2019s presence in the occupied Palestinian Territories. He lives in Ramot, an increasingly ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem considered an illegal settlement under international law.</p> <p>He has no patience with the ultra-Orthodox Jews who do not serve in the military yet receive subsidies from the government, all while not actually studying \u2014 in his mind epitomised by the young Haredi men coming to check out the secular bar scene on a Thursday night. \u201cWhy do I need to do three years [in the military] and him not?\u201d Shamsi asks. \u201cWhy do I need to pay for everything and not them?\u201d</p> <p>A few minutes\u2019 walk from the bars of Mahane Yehuda is Mea She\u2019arim, historically the most intense ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood in Jerusalem. Here, men dress in various styles of black hats and suits, depending on their sect, and walk fast, so as not to appear to be wasting time away from studying. Plastered on walls along narrow streets are posters listing deaths and other notices \u2013 a key source of information for communities that shun the internet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"054384989d46c5ce8cc012742686a56babe4b6a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/054384989d46c5ce8cc012742686a56babe4b6a6/0_228_3499_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Israel Defence Force cadets are sworn in in front of the Wailing Wall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Israel Defence Force cadets are sworn in in front of the Western Wall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominika Zarzycka/NurPhoto via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A sign near a bustling supermarket informs passers-by: \u201cIt is forbidden to participate in elections.\u201d</p> <p>Some ultra-Orthodox sects do not recognise the state of Israel, saying the Bible prescribes that it can only come into existence with the coming of the Messiah. For others, there is a more pointed boycott of elections now in protest over what they see as the Haredi parties\u2019 failure to be hardline enough on the issue of conscription.</p> <p>In places like Mea She\u2019arim, it is also frowned upon to talk to people from outside the community, explains Tal Sapir, 32. He has stopped to buy pastries on his way home to Givat Ze\u2019ev, a settlement near Jerusalem which is popular among the ultra-religious.</p> <p>Sapir \u2013 wearing a black suit and hat, with traditional side locks \u2013 says he does not take part in protests against the draft and the opening of shops on the Sabbath, as other Haredim do. In fact, he is one of the few ultra-Orthodox Jews who have undertaken national service, by working at a youth centre for a year.</p> <p>But he opposes the draft law put forward by Avigdor Lieberman, the staunchly rightwing and secular minister who led one side of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/27/netanyahu-threatens-to-call-fresh-election-as-coalition-talks-falter\" title=\"\">the political deadlock of recent weeks</a>. Lieberman\u2019s proposal included small quotas for conscription and financial sanctions on seminaries if they were unfulfilled. The three main ultra-Orthodox parties have rejected quotas of any kind.</p> <p>\u201cOnly those who don\u2019t want to study should go [to the military],\u201d said Sapir.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s Thursday night at the Mahane Yehuda market in west Jerusalem, where the music is thumping and the drinks are flowing. When a bottle breaks, the crowds erupt with a chorus of \u201cmazel tov\u201d, or congratulations. But as some ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in traditional black suits, side locks, and thick skullcaps pass by, Ad Shamsi\u2019s face sours. \u201cWhat do they have to do here?\u201d asks the 56-year-old Jewish Israeli, who is kicking off the weekend at an outside bar. This is a glimpse of the intra-religious tension that in part led Israel\u2019s parliament last week to dissolve itself and hold a fresh election \u2013 just seven weeks after the last one \u2013 following a deadlock between two rightwing factions at odds over a proposal to draft the ultra-Orthodox into Israel\u2019s military. Since Israel\u2019s founding, the ultra-Orthodox \u2013 also called the Haredim \u2013 have been exempted from military service, which is mandatory for all Jewish Israeli school leavers. The various ultra-Orthodox sects see it as a religious commandment to only study Jewish texts and separate themselves from modern society. They consequently receive government subsidies to study rather than work, along with general social services and benefits relating to unemployment, poverty and their large numbers of children. Today the ultra-Orthodox, an umbrella term for different sects and communities, are 10% of Israel\u2019s population of more than 8.5 million \u2013 and are growing fast. They have strategically cultivated a role as kingmakers in Israeli politics, making or breaking coalitions based on which politicians best support their interests. The military symbolises the antithesis of traditional ultra-Orthodox principles. It represents time away from studying, a mixing of genders against religious prohibitions and a vast melting pot in which young people are taught to be a certain kind of Israeli. For average Jewish Israelis, to be a good citizen is to serve in the military. (Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up 20% of the population, are exempt from service because of the ongoing conflict.) Shamsi is an avid supporter of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, and his rightwing, national religious policies. He wears a kippa, or Jewish head covering, thinks shops should close on the Sabbath in keeping with strict Jewish law, and supports Israel\u2019s presence in the occupied Palestinian Territories. He lives in Ramot, an increasingly ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem considered an illegal settlement under international law. He has no patience with the ultra-Orthodox Jews who do not serve in the military yet receive subsidies from the government, all while not actually studying \u2014 in his mind epitomised by the young Haredi men coming to check out the secular bar scene on a Thursday night. \u201cWhy do I need to do three years [in the military] and him not?\u201d Shamsi asks. \u201cWhy do I need to pay for everything and not them?\u201d A few minutes\u2019 walk from the bars of Mahane Yehuda is Mea She\u2019arim, historically the most intense ultra-Orthodox neighbourhood in Jerusalem. Here, men dress in various styles of black hats and suits, depending on their sect, and walk fast, so as not to appear to be wasting time away from studying. Plastered on walls along narrow streets are posters listing deaths and other notices \u2013 a key source of information for communities that shun the internet. A sign near a bustling supermarket informs passers-by: \u201cIt is forbidden to participate in elections.\u201d Some ultra-Orthodox sects do not recognise the state of Israel, saying the Bible prescribes that it can only come into existence with the coming of the Messiah. For others, there is a more pointed boycott of elections now in protest over what they see as the Haredi parties\u2019 failure to be hardline enough on the issue of conscription. In places like Mea She\u2019arim, it is also frowned upon to talk to people from outside the community, explains Tal Sapir, 32. He has stopped to buy pastries on his way home to Givat Ze\u2019ev, a settlement near Jerusalem which is popular among the ultra-religious. Sapir \u2013 wearing a black suit and hat, with traditional side locks \u2013 says he does not take part in protests against the draft and the opening of shops on the Sabbath, as other Haredim do. In fact, he is one of the few ultra-Orthodox Jews who have undertaken national service, by working at a youth centre for a year. But he opposes the draft law put forward by Avigdor Lieberman, the staunchly rightwing and secular minister who led one side of the political deadlock of recent weeks. Lieberman\u2019s proposal included small quotas for conscription and financial sanctions on seminaries if they were unfulfilled. The three main ultra-Orthodox parties have rejected quotas of any kind. \u201cOnly those who don\u2019t want to study should go [to the military],\u201d said Sapir. Forcing people to serve was seen as an attack on Haredi life. In his opinion, Lieberman had used the ultra-Orthodox as pawns in his own political battles with Netanyahu. \u201cHe\u2019s a leftist,\u201d he says of Lieberman, parroting Netanyahu. \u201cWhoever brings down a rightwing government, he\u2019s a leftist.\u201d If the ultra-Orthodox are forced to conscript, \u201cit will be a war of brothers\u201d, he says. The divide between ultra-religious and secular or less religious Israelis runs deep. But the pushback to the draft law also signals how much is changing. \u201cOn the one hand there is a modernising, opening-up trend within Haredi society,\u201d explains Rabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer of the Tikvah Fund, a thinktank. He cites increased integration of Haredim into the workforce and higher education. But this \u201calso triggers a reactionary movement in Haredi society becoming more extreme\u201d. \u201cIt all comes to a head in the issue of the army,\u201d adds Pfeffer. While other forms of integration \u2013 such as Haredim working in secular employment \u2013 are tolerated as necessary for the communities\u2019 sustainability, the ultra-Orthodox do not see military service as either useful for them or an imperative for the state. The issues of conscription and economic subsidies shape the way in which many Israelis outside the communities view the ultra-Orthodox. But for Etsy Shushan, this also makes her work at Nichvarot, an organisation that pushes for more female leaders in the ultra-Orthodox community, harder as community leaders close in on any movement for change. Shushan, 41, describes herself as \u201cHaredi Israeli\u201d \u2013 a mix of the two traditional binaries: \u201cPeople who see themselves as part of the Haredi society and also see themselves as part of life in Israel,\u201d she explains. It is a complicated third way. \u201cFor me it\u2019s very important to save the values of Judaism to protect ourselves from the western world.

      "bodyText": "Police have appealed for information after a man was raped in a park near the centre of Maidenhead, in Berkshire. A member of the public contacted Thames Valley police at about 3.30am on Saturday after finding a man in a distressed state in Grenfell Park, next to the train station in Maidenhead. Officers were watching the scene on Saturday but police did not say whether any arrests had been made. DCI Penny Mackenzie said: \u201cThis is an extremely serious offence and a thorough investigation is under way.\u201d She said the victim was believed to have met a man in Gordon\u2019s bar, Queen Street, on Friday night or early Saturday morning. The pair left the bar and walked through the park, where the victim was raped by a man near a basketball court. Mackenzie said the offender may have stolen the victim\u2019s phone. \u201cThe man that the victim met in the bar may not be the offender, however we need to speak to him as he could have vital information that can aid our investigation.\u201d She said the male suspect was white, about 173cm (5ft 8in) tall, with short brown hair, and was possibly in his early 20s.",

      "body": "<p>Since the start of her career, FKA twigs \u2013 less a singer than a very modern sort of audiovisual artist \u2013 has drawn on ballet and R&amp;B, on fetishism and body modification. But nothing this outre tunesmith has done \u2013 not even her recent comeback single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkLjqFpBh84\" title=\"\">Cellophane</a>, and its eye-popping pole-dancing video \u2013 can quite prepare you for the start of this visually intoxicating comeback show.</p> <p>Appearing in front of a lush red velvet curtain, the woman born Tahliah Barnett is dressed like a Venice carnival souvenir, tap dancing to a series of jazz scats. Sometimes she responds move for beat, sometimes it\u2019s more abstract. Baffling, impossible to parse, this is a great attention-grabber. You are expecting one kind of weird from FKA twigs, and you get quite another. Later on in the set, one of these rhythmic themes will recur in some of the songs she\u2019s performing for the first time.</p> <p>Previously staged in Los Angeles and New York, her Magdalene tour \u2013 named after an unreleased song on an album we assume is coming \u2013 is hosted for one night only in this <a href=\"https://theatre.alexandrapalace.com/\" title=\"\">recently reopened, atmospheric Victorian space</a>. The theatre had been mothballed for decades, and is reborn a strange, half-finished neoclassical space where uplit statuary and double-height ceilings magnify the resonance of this visually intoxicating set. At the start, disembodied vocals, culled from her song Mary Magdalene \u2013 \u201ca woman\u2019s touch, a woman\u2019s work\u201d \u2013 nod to Kate Bush and <a href=\"https://www.smoothradio.com/features/this-womans-work-kate-bush-meaning-lyrics-video/\" title=\"\">This Woman\u2019s Work</a>.</p> <p>A singer of not-quite-R&amp;B, Aaliyah via Bj\u00f6rk, FKA twigs has an enviable vocal range. Tonight, as she roams through her Mercury prize-nominated 2014 debut, <em>LP1</em>, its follow-up EP, <em>M3LL155X</em>, and a great tranche of new music, she tops off at a tremulous dog-whistle frequency, and bottoms out at a contralto ache. But she began her career as a dancer, and still leads her art with a sinuous physicality. The word \u201cgig\u201d doesn\u2019t quite do this interdisciplinary series of sung tableaux justice; it\u2019s like an Instagram feed gone live, mixing high fashion with intergalactic stripclub vibes and a deep well of female sorrow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6078a36a743760f715b98876b47166b4804d8e41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6078a36a743760f715b98876b47166b4804d8e41/0_0_4224_2816/1000.jpg\" alt=\"FKA Twigs Performs At Alexandra Palace Theatre\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Although she has an ardent fanbase of cognoscenti, FKA twigs is more widely recognised for being half of a former celebrity couple. (Her ex, Robert Pattinson, was the star of a vampire-themed film franchise; she is actually far more otherworldly.) She has not done any explicit interviews around her new material, but you can\u2019t help but suppose that the breakup of her three-year relationship \u2013 one lived in the goldfish bowl of celebrity, and in which she served as a lightning rod for t<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/16/arts/music/fka-twigs-lives-large-in-congregata-and-beyond.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">he racist attitudes of some <em>Twilight</em> fans</a> \u2013 might find emotional expression in her new work. Indeed, <em>LP2</em> looks as though it is shaping up to be FKA twigs\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/25/bjork-royal-albert-hall-vulnicura-review\" title=\"\"><em>Vulnicura</em></a> \u2013 the Bj\u00f6rk album in which the Icelandic auteur processed her breakup from her long-term partner.</p> <p>Little in this grandiose, oblique show actually matches the opening dance for sheer jaw-dropping wonder; a few scenes come close and one transcends it. First, there is a lot to process. Songs from the first album unfurl with stately froideur and a dancer\u2019s restraint; the curtain parts to reveal more curtains.

      "bodyText": "Since the start of her career, FKA twigs \u2013 less a singer than a very modern sort of audiovisual artist \u2013 has drawn on ballet and R&amp;B, on fetishism and body modification. But nothing this outre tunesmith has done \u2013 not even her recent comeback single, Cellophane, and its eye-popping pole-dancing video \u2013 can quite prepare you for the start of this visually intoxicating comeback show. Appearing in front of a lush red velvet curtain, the woman born Tahliah Barnett is dressed like a Venice carnival souvenir, tap dancing to a series of jazz scats. Sometimes she responds move for beat, sometimes it\u2019s more abstract. Baffling, impossible to parse, this is a great attention-grabber. You are expecting one kind of weird from FKA twigs, and you get quite another. Later on in the set, one of these rhythmic themes will recur in some of the songs she\u2019s performing for the first time. Previously staged in Los Angeles and New York, her Magdalene tour \u2013 named after an unreleased song on an album we assume is coming \u2013 is hosted for one night only in this recently reopened, atmospheric Victorian space. The theatre had been mothballed for decades, and is reborn a strange, half-finished neoclassical space where uplit statuary and double-height ceilings magnify the resonance of this visually intoxicating set. At the start, disembodied vocals, culled from her song Mary Magdalene \u2013 \u201ca woman\u2019s touch, a woman\u2019s work\u201d \u2013 nod to Kate Bush and This Woman\u2019s Work. A singer of not-quite-R&amp;B, Aaliyah via Bj\u00f6rk, FKA twigs has an enviable vocal range. Tonight, as she roams through her Mercury prize-nominated 2014 debut, LP1, its follow-up EP, M3LL155X, and a great tranche of new music, she tops off at a tremulous dog-whistle frequency, and bottoms out at a contralto ache. But she began her career as a dancer, and still leads her art with a sinuous physicality. The word \u201cgig\u201d doesn\u2019t quite do this interdisciplinary series of sung tableaux justice; it\u2019s like an Instagram feed gone live, mixing high fashion with intergalactic stripclub vibes and a deep well of female sorrow. Although she has an ardent fanbase of cognoscenti, FKA twigs is more widely recognised for being half of a former celebrity couple. (Her ex, Robert Pattinson, was the star of a vampire-themed film franchise; she is actually far more otherworldly.) She has not done any explicit interviews around her new material, but you can\u2019t help but suppose that the breakup of her three-year relationship \u2013 one lived in the goldfish bowl of celebrity, and in which she served as a lightning rod for the racist attitudes of some Twilight fans \u2013 might find emotional expression in her new work. Indeed, LP2 looks as though it is shaping up to be FKA twigs\u2019s Vulnicura \u2013 the Bj\u00f6rk album in which the Icelandic auteur processed her breakup from her long-term partner. Little in this grandiose, oblique show actually matches the opening dance for sheer jaw-dropping wonder; a few scenes come close and one transcends it. First, there is a lot to process. Songs from the first album unfurl with stately froideur and a dancer\u2019s restraint; the curtain parts to reveal more curtains. She seems alone, singing as though to backing tracks; but the gig is really a series of reveals. She swaps her microphone for a sword, and stage-fights an invisible presence. One of the downsides of this ambitious, but highly stylised, show is how the music seems to serve the pictures she wants to make, rather than the other way around. Dancers appear; later still, when curtain after curtain falls, a three-piece band is revealed on some scaffolding \u2013 two operatives at banks of digital gear and a cellist, the nerve centre of this operation. Halfway through the set, the new material finally debuts. Mary Magdalene finds her enunciating crisply, more Judy Garland than Aaliyah; multitracked vocals eventually take the song polyphonic. For Home With You, her look channels something of a nomadic tribeswoman on her wedding day; she ministers to a person in the front row, presumably in an echo of Jesus\u2019s girlfriend.

The costume design here alludes to Vivienne Westwood, a visual influence: FKA twigs collects vintage Westwood and recently performed Cellophane at the Wallace Collection in central London, a museum whose 18th-century artworks have inspired Westwood\u2019s designs. Glitter falls. When it comes, the mournful piano ballad Cellophane is delivered as an encore at the lip of the stage, with the red curtain once again shut behind her. \u201cDidn\u2019t I do it for you,\u201d she begins, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I do it for you?\u201d In the video, the song\u2019s meaning is clear: look at this cool, bendy goddess you are spurning.

More to the point, the planet\u2019s two remaining species \u2013 the Cuban and the Hispaniolan solenodon, both highly endangered \u2013 have endured, virtually unchanged, for the past 76 million years. Other related species have become extinct.</p> <p>And that makes solenodons very important, according to Professor Sam Turvey, of the Zoological Society of London. \u201cThey are the last fruits on an entire branch of the tree of evolution,\u201d said Turvey, who was last month awarded one of the most prestigious awards in zoology, the Linnean medal, for his work on evolution and human impacts on wildlife. \u201cThere are no close counterparts to solenodons left on Earth, yet they have been on the planet since the time of the dinosaurs.\u201d</p> <p>Solenodons have been brought close to extinction by the mongoose, the carnivore introduced to their native islands to kill snakes and rodents. They are classic examples of an \u201cEdge\u201d \u2013 evolutionary distinct and globally endangered \u2013 species. This means they have no close relatives and represent our last chances to preserve entire branches or trunks of the evolutionary tree.</p> <p>Other examples include the critically endangered vaquita, a species of porpoise from the Gulf of California, and the Sumatran rhino. \u201cA lot of attention is paid to other threatened rhino species,\u201d said Turvey, \u201cbut the Sumatran, which is down to only a few dozen survivors, is the only woolly rhino left on the planet. It is special.\u201d</p> <p>These animals stand in contrast with other threatened species which have close relatives that fill similar ecological niches. The polar bear, for example, is closely related to the grizzly. Should the former die out, the latter could provide a fair amount of genetic substitution, say scientists. By contrast, there is no species that could do the same for solenodons.</p> <p>Another example is provided by the gibbons of Asia. Most species are now endangered, with some, such as the Hainan gibbon, facing imminent extinction. Yet gibbons were once widespread and common. \u201cIn the tombs of ancient Chinese emperors,\u201d said Turvey, \u201cwe have discovered bones of gibbons, kept as high-status pets, from species previously unknown to science. Over millennia, we have lost countless species, and entire genera, of gibbons in Asia.\u201d</p> <p>Turvey\u2019s particular period of evolutionary interest is the past 10,000 years. \u201cBefore that time, the climate was changing rapidly as the world emerged from the last ice age. However, it then stabilised and that means we can be more sure that the extinctions which occurred from then on were caused by humans.\u201d</p> <p>In that period, humans conquered the continents and around 250 species of mammal were wiped out as we made our way round the globe, with the Caribbean suffering particularly badly. \u201cMore that 100 species of monkey, sloth, rodent and bat were killed off from its islands, and humans were undoubtedly to blame for most of these extinctions,\u201d said Turvey.</p> <p>\u201cMany of the rodents would have been cat-sized and would have played an important role in dispersal of seeds and vegetation, but would also have been an important source of protein for newly arrived humans. As a result, they were wiped out. Virtually every island in the tropics lost a unique species of rodent thanks to humans.\u201d</p> <p>In addition, hundreds, possibly thousands, of species of bird were lost, particularly in the tropical Pacific, he said. Most of this carnage was caused by the hunting of birds \u2013 often flightless like the dodo \u2013 and mammals for food. \u201cThat pattern has changed recently,\u201d added Turvey. \u201cIt is not direct killing that is doing the main damage today; it is our destruction of wild habitats to make room for farms or roads. That has become the main cause of extinctions.\u201d</p> <h2>Animals on the edge</h2> <p>Evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered (Edge) animals have a highly threatened status but few closely related species.

During <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/31/meryl-streep-criticises-phrase-toxic-masculinity\">a recent panel discussion about the new season of Big Little Lies</a> the cast started talking about how many men enjoyed the female-led show; Streep then announced that \u201cwe hurt our boys by calling something toxic masculinity. Women can be pretty fucking toxic \u2026 It\u2019s toxic people.</p> <p>\u201cWe have our good angles and we have our bad ones,\u201d Streep continued. \u201cI think the labels are less helpful than what we\u2019re trying to get to, which is a communication, direct, between human beings. We\u2019re all on the boat together. We\u2019ve got to make it work.\u201d</p> <p>(Excuse me, can someone stop the boat for a moment please? I just need a second while my eyes stop rolling.)</p> <p>Seriously, Meryl? Seriously? I don\u2019t want to label Streep\u2019s comments \u201cridiculous\u201d, because labels are less helpful than what I\u2019m trying to get to, which is the fact Streep clearly has no idea what \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d means. I shouldn\u2019t have to say this, it should be obvious, but \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that men are toxic or that masculinity is de facto toxic. Rather, it means that extreme forms of traits traditionally associated with masculinity, like aggression and stoicism, are toxic. Rightwingers, however, like to pretend the phrase is an attack on men because it\u2019s a quick way of derailing a conversation about rigid gender norms, and allows them to pretend that feminism is some sort of plot against men. Indeed conservative outlets like Fox News are already having a field day with Streep\u2019s comments.</p> <p>We don\u2019t \u201churt our boys\u201d by labelling certain behavior \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. We hurt our boys when we teach them that being a man means suppressing your emotions and treating women as an inferior species, to be dominated and controlled. And toxic masculinity doesn\u2019t just hurt men, it kills them. In America, for example, men are 3.5 times more likely to die from suicide than women \u2013 a phenomenon <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190313-why-more-men-kill-themselves-than-women\">many experts attribute</a>, in part, to the fact that men are told they shouldn\u2019t express emotion or admit that they feel vulnerable, and therefore are less likely to seek professional help.</p> <p>It\u2019s also well established that toxic masculinity kills women. Women are far more likely than men to die at the hands of their partner, to cite just one example. As a 2018 <a href=\"https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/GSH2018/GSH18_Gender-related_killing_of_women_and_girls.pdf\">United Nations global study</a> on homicide notes, \u201cIntimate partner violence against women and girls is rooted in widely-accepted gender norms about men\u2019s authority \u2026and men\u2019s use of violence to exert control over women. Research shows that men and boys who adhere to rigid views of gender roles and masculinity \u2026 are more likely to use violence against a partner.\u201d</p> <p>Streep is right that women can also be \u201cpretty fucking toxic\u201d. But, again, she misses the point completely; the issue isn\u2019t individual women but rigid social norms associated with femininity. Being told that being a woman means being pretty and pure is toxic. Being told that your worth as a woman rests on getting married and having kids is toxic. Being taught to cry and play the damsel in distress to avoid accountability is toxic. Being taught to treat other women as sexual rivals is toxic.</p> <p>Here\u2019s the big difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity, however: the latter is a lot less deadly, a lot less dangerous. The difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity is that the president of the United States is not a woman who has boasted about grabbing men by their genitals, and dismissed this as \u201clocker room talk\u201d. The difference is that there aren\u2019t <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brett-kavanaugh-clarence-thomas_n_5bb761b5e4b0876eda9d73e8\">two female supreme court justices</a> who have been accused of sexual misconduct. The difference is that a group of powerful women are not currently passing legislation preventing American men having control over their own bodies.</p> <p>The fact that Streep can talk about how \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d, as a phrase, harms boys at a time when American women are currently facing a full-on assault of their reproductive rights is mind-boggling. The fact that she can blithely say that \u201cwe\u2019re all on the boat together\u201d when Republicans have made it very clear they\u2019re steering the boat towards Gilead, is infuriating.

      "bodyText": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday. #NotAllMen, says Meryl Streep Meryl Streep isn\u2019t a big fan of the phrase \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d, apparently. During a recent panel discussion about the new season of Big Little Lies the cast started talking about how many men enjoyed the female-led show; Streep then announced that \u201cwe hurt our boys by calling something toxic masculinity. Women can be pretty fucking toxic \u2026 It\u2019s toxic people. \u201cWe have our good angles and we have our bad ones,\u201d Streep continued. \u201cI think the labels are less helpful than what we\u2019re trying to get to, which is a communication, direct, between human beings. We\u2019re all on the boat together. We\u2019ve got to make it work.\u201d (Excuse me, can someone stop the boat for a moment please? I just need a second while my eyes stop rolling.) Seriously, Meryl? Seriously? I don\u2019t want to label Streep\u2019s comments \u201cridiculous\u201d, because labels are less helpful than what I\u2019m trying to get to, which is the fact Streep clearly has no idea what \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d means. I shouldn\u2019t have to say this, it should be obvious, but \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that men are toxic or that masculinity is de facto toxic. Rather, it means that extreme forms of traits traditionally associated with masculinity, like aggression and stoicism, are toxic. Rightwingers, however, like to pretend the phrase is an attack on men because it\u2019s a quick way of derailing a conversation about rigid gender norms, and allows them to pretend that feminism is some sort of plot against men. Indeed conservative outlets like Fox News are already having a field day with Streep\u2019s comments. We don\u2019t \u201churt our boys\u201d by labelling certain behavior \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d. We hurt our boys when we teach them that being a man means suppressing your emotions and treating women as an inferior species, to be dominated and controlled. And toxic masculinity doesn\u2019t just hurt men, it kills them. In America, for example, men are 3.5 times more likely to die from suicide than women \u2013 a phenomenon many experts attribute, in part, to the fact that men are told they shouldn\u2019t express emotion or admit that they feel vulnerable, and therefore are less likely to seek professional help. It\u2019s also well established that toxic masculinity kills women. Women are far more likely than men to die at the hands of their partner, to cite just one example. As a 2018 United Nations global study on homicide notes, \u201cIntimate partner violence against women and girls is rooted in widely-accepted gender norms about men\u2019s authority \u2026and men\u2019s use of violence to exert control over women. Research shows that men and boys who adhere to rigid views of gender roles and masculinity \u2026 are more likely to use violence against a partner.\u201d Streep is right that women can also be \u201cpretty fucking toxic\u201d. But, again, she misses the point completely; the issue isn\u2019t individual women but rigid social norms associated with femininity. Being told that being a woman means being pretty and pure is toxic. Being told that your worth as a woman rests on getting married and having kids is toxic. Being taught to cry and play the damsel in distress to avoid accountability is toxic. Being taught to treat other women as sexual rivals is toxic. Here\u2019s the big difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity, however: the latter is a lot less deadly, a lot less dangerous. The difference between toxic masculinity and toxic femininity is that the president of the United States is not a woman who has boasted about grabbing men by their genitals, and dismissed this as \u201clocker room talk\u201d. The difference is that there aren\u2019t two female supreme court justices who have been accused of sexual misconduct. The difference is that a group of powerful women are not currently passing legislation preventing American men having control over their own bodies. The fact that Streep can talk about how \u201ctoxic masculinity\u201d, as a phrase, harms boys at a time when American women are currently facing a full-on assault of their reproductive rights is mind-boggling. The fact that she can blithely say that \u201cwe\u2019re all on the boat together\u201d when Republicans have made it very clear they\u2019re steering the boat towards Gilead, is infuriating. But at least she stopped her lecture on civility there, I suppose. We can, at least, be grateful that she didn\u2019t go on to inform us that All Lives Matter, and we shouldn\u2019t focus on labels or race because we\u2019re all Africans really. Women\u2019s fertility app funded by anti-abortion campaigners A Guardian investigation has found that the Femm app, which helps women keep track of their menstrual cycle, received large amounts of funding from anti-abortion Catholic campaigners. The Guardian also notes that the \u201cFemm app\u2019s literature sows doubt about the safety and efficacy of hormonal birth control, asserting that it may be deleterious to a woman\u2019s health and that a safer, \u2018natural\u2019 way for women to avoid pregnancy is to learn their cycles.\u201d It\u2019s the latest disturbing reminder that female-focused health apps don\u2019t always serve your best interests. America\u2019s war against abortion continues On Thursday Louisiana became the latest state to pass a strict new abortion ban. South Africa\u2019s historic gender-balanced cabinet For the first time in South Africa\u2019s history half of all cabinet posts are now held by women. Leonardo DiCreepio\u2019s gross dating habits Someone on Reddit made a graph showing Leonardo DiCaprio (44) refuses to date a woman over 25. Since 1999 the average age of his girlfriends has been 22.9 years. The French men\u2019s soccer team needs a talking to The Women\u2019s World Cup is around the corner, which is something of a big deal. That hasn\u2019t stopped the French men\u2019s football team from kicking the women\u2019s squad out of the national training camp, just days before the competition gets under way. Nice one, lads. Accidental sky penis The US air force has a history of using their fighter jets to draw phallic images in the sky during training exercises. The latest incident was on Tuesday but air force officials have insisted \u201cthere was no nefarious or inappropriate behavior during the training flight\u201d. Rest assured it was simply a cock-up.

      "bodyText": "Hi, Nicole! What can you tell us about your episode of Black Mirror, Striking Vipers? That\u2019s what\u2019s so tricky! I don\u2019t think I can tell you anything. What the heck are we going to talk about? I play the wife of Anthony Mackie. The episode is largely about navigating coupledom, and how technology might hinder a relationship in the Black Mirror world. Is filming an episode of Black Mirror as surprising as watching one? It was honestly the most fun I\u2019ve had. We shot it in S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, which was amazing. It definitely didn\u2019t feel like any other experience I\u2019ve had before. How did you get involved? Or when Charlie Brooker comes a-calling, do you just say yes? Are you serious? Black Mirror is literally one of my favourite television shows on the planet. I look forward to it. I\u2019m disappointed when it\u2019s over. I binge it. I was just honoured to be asked. Do you Americans think all us Brits are as utterly bonkers as Charlie Brooker? We only had a big conference call between the table reads, so I still haven\u2019t met Charlie face-to-face. My mother is Jamaican and I grew up in east London so I have a ton of family in the UK. So I know for a fact that you are all just as crazy! What one Black Mirror-style thing do you hope comes true/definitely doesn\u2019t come true? Oh my goodness. There\u2019s so many things I really hope don\u2019t happen. Every episode I\u2019m like, \u201cHoly shit, please don\u2019t let this happen\u201d.

I like the idea of having a timer for dating, like in Hang the DJ, where every time you meet someone, you find out how long that relationship is actually going to last. I kind of like that. What would happen in a Sleepy Hollow/Black Mirror crossover? Sleepy Hollow had so many storylines, I\u2019ve really no idea what would happen if you added technology. The fans from both worlds are super smart and super loyal. It would be great to have something super-juicy, scary and mind bending to share with the fans. You\u2019re only 5ft 2in. How do you reach the top shelf in the supermarket? I would say 5ft 3in on a good day! How do I reach the top shelf? I\u2019m going to beat you up when and if I see you!

It isn\u2019t the viscera-smeared new Fatal and Krushing Blow moves that are causing controversy, though: the storyline of one character, Jax, who goes back in time to destroy the transatlantic slave trade, and the redesign of female characters to make them less overtly sexualised, has led to accusations from some fans that the game has ceded to \u201csocial justice warrior\u201d politics.</p> <p>A genre once vilified for its irresponsibility is now vilified for the opposite.

The pro scene is thriving, with big annual professional events such as the Evolution Championship Series, featuring classic brands such as Street Fighter, Tekken and Soulcalibur, attracting millions of views on Twitch and YouTube. After the success of Capcom\u2019s Marvel tie-ins, comic book rival DC has entered the fighting universe with Injustice: Gods Among Us, a great big, bone-crunching scrapper filled with familiar heroes and super villains. The studio behind that game, NeverRealm Studios, has Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon as its creative director, and its latest title, Mortal Kombat 11, takes the censor-baiting fighting legend back to its provocative glory days. It isn\u2019t the viscera-smeared new Fatal and Krushing Blow moves that are causing controversy, though: the storyline of one character, Jax, who goes back in time to destroy the transatlantic slave trade, and the redesign of female characters to make them less overtly sexualised, has led to accusations from some fans that the game has ceded to \u201csocial justice warrior\u201d politics. A genre once vilified for its irresponsibility is now vilified for the opposite. And that\u2019s how you stay relevant in 2019. \u2022 Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June.",

      "bodyText": "Donald Trump has backed Boris Johnson to be the next prime minister, in an interview with the Sun in which he also described Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, as \u201cnasty\u201d. The president, speaking to the British newspaper before he visits the UK on Monday, expressed support for the former foreign secretary in his bid to replace Theresa May, saying: \u201cI think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent.\u201d Trump\u2019s endorsement has not been warmly welcomed. Mel Stride, the newly appointed Commons leader, said that while Trump was entitled to his opinion, he would not be picking the next prime minister of the UK, and put his own weight behind Michael Gove. Stride told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme: \u201cThere will be lots of people out there, and the president of the United States is a very important person of course, who will be backing different candidates in this race \u2026 We\u2019ve got a time of national crisis right now that we face as a country and as a parliament and we need somebody who is ready to lead. And Michael is ready to lead.\u201d Stride added: \u201cThe president of the United States of course is entitled to his opinion, but it\u2019s not the case of him picking the next prime minister of our country. That process, as you know, will be one involving the parliamentary party and then the membership itself.\u201d Johnson has yet to respond to Trump\u2019s comments, but the frontrunner in the Tory leadership race has not always been complimentary of the US president. In 2015, when Trump claimed there were \u201cno-go areas\u201d in London where police feared for their lives because of a threat posed by Muslims, Johnson said it showed \u201cquite stupefying ignorance that makes him frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States\u201d. May is to step down on 7 June, just days after Trump\u2019s official state visit, which will include attending commemorations of the 75th anniversary of D-day in Portsmouth.

      "body": "<p>In the courtyard outside an Edinburgh hotel, a boy barely in his teens excitedly asks Noel Edmonds for a selfie. The former presenter seems surprised, but it might be a bit of an act: he is, after all, one of the most recognisable faces in Britain. And since his brief but compelling turn on last year\u2019s I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!, Edmonds\u2019 appeal has become what he calls \u201cintergenerational\u201d. His teenage stepson\u2019s mates have looked him up on YouTube and were, he says, wowed by his appearance \u201cintroducing a band at some massive gig at Wembley\u201d. (They mean Live Aid, where Edmonds\u2019 company also provided all of the helicopter transport.)</p> <p>So now he is familiar to the kids of 2019, as well as those of us who grew up with him in the 1970s (presenting Multi-Coloured Swap Shop and Top Of The Pops), 1980s (The Late Late Breakfast Show, Telly Addicts), 1990s (Noel\u2019s House Party) or 2000s (Deal Or No Deal). House Party, his madcap teatime show featuring sidekick Mr Blobby and the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/feb/26/janinegibson\" title=\"\">reached a peak of 15 million viewers on BBC One</a>. It is difficult to think of anyone else who has had so many mainstream hits, over such a long period of time. For a bloke who can\u2019t sing, dance, act or even really tell a joke, he\u2019s an unlikely king of British light entertainment. What is Noel Edmonds\u2019 secret?</p> <p>\u201cPeople are always asking me that,\u201d he says. \u201cI tell them to mind their own business. Go and learn something for yourself. Be curious, that\u2019s all I ask of people. I\u2019m not going to tell you where the gold is buried until you come over to my side.\u201d</p> <p>He says he doesn\u2019t watch much TV and isn\u2019t particularly bothered about being on it. A show with his Jungle sidekick Harry Redknapp is said to be in production, but, \u201cI have another life. I live in a lovely part of France. I have business interests in Dubai, Monaco and all over the world. If people think I am a failure because I am not on telly every day, that is their problem.\u201d</p> <p>Edmonds is in Edinburgh to attend Lloyds bank\u2019s AGM. His mission is to disrupt the event, just as he did last year, by cross-examining those at the top about the banking fraud that Edmonds blames for bringing down his production company, as well as at least 60 other businesses in the mid-00s. (A group of corrupt consultants colluded with Lynden Scourfield, a former manager at the Reading branch of HBOS, the bank later acquired by Lloyds, to load businesses with unmanageable debts, forcing them into administration, seizing their assets and spending the profits on exotic holidays and parties. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/07/lloyds-hbos-loan-scam-lynden-scourfield-compensation\" title=\"\">They were given lengthy jail sentences in 2017</a>.)</p> <p>Edmonds flew in from the south of France this morning excited by the prospect of causing chaos at an AGM that will be livestreamed around the world. Over dinner the night before, he sips at a glass of red wine. \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep a clear head for the morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got some great stuff up my sleeve.\u201d At 70, he is lithe and muscular, the beard and hairdo immaculate. His shirt is undone, 70s he-man style, to reveal a wooden pendant.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My wife doesn\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who looks 70. So I keep in shape. I do something I call snackcercise</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When he was voted off I\u2019m A Celebrity, the tabloids called him a hunk. I tell Edmonds I once read he got up at 4am and worked out for four hours. \u201cOh fucking hell, fuck off!\u201d he exclaims. But he flexes a large bicep and places his arm on the table: \u201cDo you want to arm wrestle me?\u201d I tell him I don\u2019t want to risk losing to a 70-year-old in public. \u201cExactly,\u201d he beams. \u201cJust like my wife doesn\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who looks 70. So I work hard to keep in shape. I do something I call snackcercise.\u201d This, he explains, involves working your muscles to a point where they can\u2019t go on, then returning to that exercise 48 hours later. Stretching, he thinks, is a time-wasting con invented by personal trainers.</p> <p>In the three hours I spend with Edmonds, the effervescent and slightly mysterious man I grew up watching on TV is by turns charming, combative, sentimental, angry and playful. He is fond of referring to himself in the third person. He opines on anything and everything, from the BBC (\u201cIt will die in my lifetime. Sometimes you just have to accept that an illness is terminal,\u201d), to Nigel Farage (\u201cYou might as well ask me what I think about semolina!\u201d), to The Jeremy Kyle Show (\u201cIs this what TV shows are supposed to do now? Use the public as cannon fodder?\u201d), to animal rights (\u201cThere are pets dying every day because their owners can\u2019t afford the extortionate vets bills \u2013 and they are hassling ITV about the rights of the fucking insects on I\u2019m A Celebrity!\u201d). In 2016, he set up a pet counselling service, calling cats and dogs to offer them words of affirmation and positivity. After counselling a cat called Dana down the line on Jeremy Vine\u2019s Radio 2 show (\u201cFish Dana, you like fish, don\u2019t you?\u201d) he reportedly received 2,000 applications for help in four hours. By May 2019, however, there was no sign of the service on his website.</p> <p>For the first 30 years of Edmonds\u2019 career he maintained a studiously safe and middle-of-the-road persona. These days, he is almost as famous for his controversial opinions \u2013 about the benefits of pulse electromagnetism or the power of positive thought to tackle cancer (of which more later) \u2013 as he is for his presenting talents. Was this maverick Noel Edmonds always there, carefully hidden to preserve his status as Mr Saturday Night? Or did something change in his life to make him turn to all of this stuff?</p> <p>\u201cI was brought up to be loyal, trustworthy, hardworking and to deliver,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you hired Noel Edmonds to do something then, by God, he worked hard at it. When all the other Radio 1 DJs were larking about, I was hard at work preparing the content for my shows. Where are they now?\u201d So he was always competitive? \u201cExtremely,\u201d he says. With whom? \u201cMyself, probably.\u201d</p> <p>None of which really answers my question. \u201cMaybe I was always more than one person, or even two,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe being on TV was just my job. People find it hard to get their heads around that.\u201d So work left no room for the rest of his personality? \u201cA couple of times I have shone a light on the other sides of my life, but I have learned to be cautious about that. Because people are only comfortable with the Noel Edmonds they see on television.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f020c6897586d40a1d5914c4bc64650b80fa3e52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f020c6897586d40a1d5914c4bc64650b80fa3e52/238_1104_3532_4415/800.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Edmonds\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Noel Edmonds photographed at Edinburgh University: \u2018This is the happiest period in my life.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One major turning point was the 2005 collapse of his entertainment company, Unique Group \u2013 an umbrella for various production companies that owned the rights to, among other things, Mr Blobby and Telly Addicts. But Edmonds remains dogged in his pursuit of Lloyds, whom he holds responsible, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/nov/19/noel-edmonds-likely-to-file-60m-lloyds-lawsuit-on-wednesday\" title=\"\">seeking \u00a360m in losses and damages</a>. (Lloyds say they will dispute his claim if it gets to court.) Edmonds complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the By Your Side Lloyds ad campaign, claiming it was hypocritical. The complaint wasn\u2019t upheld, but the acres of press coverage were damaging. In the past year, Edmonds has widened his campaign to investigate the role he says Lloyds and other banks have played in the closure of 100,000 businesses since the financial crisis, ultimately bringing about a decade of austerity. His YouTube channel Lloyds Victims has 1.8m subscribers, and last year he set up an online radio station, Positively Noel, inviting Lloyds staffers to blow the whistle in breaks between pertinent tracks such as Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel\u2019s Don\u2019t Give Up and LunchMoney Lewis\u2019 Bills.</p> <p>At around the same time his business collapsed, Edmonds\u2019 marriage to his second wife, Helen Soby, with whom he had four daughters, came to an end (he has since remarried, to Liz Davies, who worked as a makeup artist on Deal Or No Deal). \u201cIt was my rock bottom,\u201d he tells me. \u201cLet\u2019s be 100% clear about this: I tried to kill myself on January 18, 2005.\u201d</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until 2017, 12 years later, that he spoke publicly of his suicide attempt. \u201cI was as guilty as most people of thinking that anyone who wanted to take their own life was selfish and ridiculous. But you really can\u2019t judge anyone until you\u2019ve been in that space,\u201d he says. After receiving treatment at the Priory hospital in Bristol, he slowly began to rebuild his life.</p> <p>It was around the same time that Edmonds discovered the idea of cosmic ordering, whereby he would write a list of requests to the universe and wait for them to come about. \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t always work,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I actually think you can lead a happier life if you think, \u2018I wanted that to happen, I prayed for that to happen and if it didn\u2019t perhaps I have to accept that it just wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u2019 You don\u2019t just stop believing in something because it doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e178deaad5d577a12a799a9e98576db5adfc2431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e178deaad5d577a12a799a9e98576db5adfc2431/91_77_1687_1012/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On Deal Or No Deal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Deal Or No Deal, for which he was nominated for a Bafta.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Just months after his suicide attempt, Edmonds became the face of Deal Or No Deal, a daytime game show with a baffling set of rules: a contestant selected identical boxes from a row of 22, each of which contained a different sum of money (the maximum being \u00a3250,000). An anonymous \u201cbanker\u201d would communicate with the contestant by phone via Edmonds, making real-money offers to buy the boxes. It was, effectively, a simple guessing game \u2013 but Edmonds elevated it into drama so compelling that AA Gill described it as \u201clike putting heroin in your remote control\u201d. Other hosts might have been funny or lightly mocked the format, but Edmonds takes everything he does deeply seriously. Deal Or No Deal became one of Channel 4\u2019s most popular shows and Edmonds was nominated for a Bafta; it ran for a decade, before coming to an end in 2016.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"052f62ffca4f40d67feff5e72c46a22b7e44e966\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/052f62ffca4f40d67feff5e72c46a22b7e44e966/0_45_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Noel Edmonds with Noel\u2019s House Party sidekick Mr Blobby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Noel\u2019s House Party sidekick Mr Blobby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His campaign against Lloyds is partly a way of making a positive from a negative, but it must be stressful. Is he happy? \u201cThis is the happiest period in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff going on that I never thought Noel Edmonds would get involved with. I am going to ensure that the small group of UK bankers that brought 12 years of austerity and deprivation upon the British people will go to prison. And if that is my legacy, then I would prefer it to being Mr Blobby\u2019s friend.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>The only child of two teachers, Lydia and Dudley (Edmonds refers to them by their Christian names), he spent his childhood in Ilford, east London, and then the suburbs of Essex. It was a lower-middle-class upbringing, and his parents made sacrifices to send him to Brentwood, the public school, where Douglas Adams and Griff Rhys Jones were contemporaries.</p> <p>His early career was driven largely by a desire to impress his parents. \u201cWhen I was invited on Desert Island Discs by Roy Plomley [in 1978] my dad finally started to think that I had a proper job,\u201d he says. After sitting his A-levels, he had turned down a place at Surrey University. \u201cWhen I told my dad I was going to be a disc jockey in Luxembourg, I must have broken his heart. But he forgave me and just said, \u2018OK, go and be the best disc jockey there is.\u2019\u201d Edmonds was offered a job as a newsreader at Radio Luxembourg in 1968, after sending the offshore station tapes of himself. \u201cYou cannot imagine how exciting it was to be broadcasting pop music in the 60s,\u201d he says. \u201cThe BBC had been giving us just a couple of hours a week. Then suddenly these new pirate stations were playing it round the clock \u2013 it felt like we were in America.\u201d</p> <p>In 1969, aged 20, he became the youngest disc jockey Radio 1 had ever hired (a record that stood until 1999). Within a few years he was hosting the breakfast show and attracting over 10m daily listeners. His hero was Kenny Everett, whom he eventually replaced on Saturday mornings. \u201cI could never be as funny as Kenny, who was a genius,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I aspired to create the same amount of original content as him. That\u2019s what always drives me: creating stuff that will entertain people. And I put the hours in.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d59db45d4fe8f7a4e080213a08bcf229be0aa6f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d59db45d4fe8f7a4e080213a08bcf229be0aa6f5/663_41_1676_2095/800.jpg\" alt=\"DJing in 1970.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DJing in 1970.

I thought, if I come off air and I\u2019ve amused myself, then maybe it\u2019s worked.\u201d</p> <p>On Swap Shop, Edmonds broke the mould of patronising children\u2019s TV by presiding over an anarchic show in a T-shirt and long hair, freewheeling without a script or earpiece. On House Party, his Gotcha Oscars set the bar for celebrity pranking, a format that has been mimicked ever since (not least, and by their own admission, by Ant and Dec). House Party\u2019s NTV feature turned the cameras on viewers watching the show in their front rooms long before Gogglebox. Even if you didn\u2019t care for Edmonds, his ideas transcended his personality and drew audiences of millions.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Edmonds says he remembers watching The Val Doonican Show with Lydia and Dudley at home in Essex, and telling them he was going to be a TV presenter. What made him so sure? \u201cI heard the other disc jockeys on Radio Caroline, and saw the other presenters on TV, and simply thought, \u2018I could do that,\u2019\u201d he says. Was he particularly funny or outgoing at school? \u201cNo, never. But I was never going to fit into a 1,000-boy school that was designed to just train people up for university. I\u2019ve always wanted to be different. I\u2019ve always had this huge positive energy around me.\u201d</p> <p>He has claimed in previous interviews that his parents, both now dead, accompany him in the form of melon-sized orbs wherever he goes. They certainly loom large in his conversation. \u201cWe formed a triangle, the three of us,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe triangle is a very important shape. But then the triangle was broken. And nobody sympathises with an orphan in their 60s.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe it is his desire to be taken seriously that has inspired Edmonds to investigate worlds less frivolous than Crinkley Bottom. In recent years his proclamations on electromagnetic energy (he has claimed it helped with his prostate cancer), cosmic ordering, and population control have generated both controversy and ridicule. But he insists that his comments have been taken out of context, and that his beliefs are rooted in research. He tells me he lives by a rule called FKO, which stands for facts, knowledge, opinion. \u201cFirst you get the facts and that gives you the knowledge to form an opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cI came up with the idea of FKO when people started calling me barmy.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016, Edmonds tweeted <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tees-43427982\" title=\"\">cancer patient Vaun Norman</a> to ask him whether his illness might have been caused by negative thinking. Were people not justified in calling that, at the very least, \u201cbarmy\u201d?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea595be63f340b5eb27ea5362a2b62ea51a3cf5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea595be63f340b5eb27ea5362a2b62ea51a3cf5c/111_128_2954_3693/800.jpg\" alt=\"Edmonds with his wife Liz Davies, who worked as a makeup artist on Deal Or No Deal.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edmonds with his wife Liz Davies, who worked as a makeup artist on Deal Or No Deal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rocky/WENN.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was trying to generate curiosity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe starting point was me saying that pulsed electromagnetism had helped me tackle \u2013 not cure \u2013 my cancer. Wouldn\u2019t you think that, in a balanced media environment, people might think: \u2018That\u2019s interesting, let\u2019s have a dip into that?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Edmonds was then invited on to This Morning to explain his comments: he told a sceptical Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that he had bought a \u00a32,315 device called an EMPpad which helped \u201ctackle\u201d cancer; he later explained it worked by \u201crecalibrating all the blood cells and readjusting the electromagnetism in your body\u201d. In a statement, EMPpad Ltd, manufacturers of the device, strongly distanced themselves from this claim.</p> <p>Last year, Victoria Derbyshire (who is in remission from breast cancer) confronted Edmonds about these claims on her BBC show. He later apologised to Norman, but remains unrepentant about the benefits of pulsed electromagnetism. \u201cThe idea that I said, \u2018I have a cure for cancer\u2019 \u2013 I mean, fuck off! If that were true I\u2019d own the whole world. All I said was: \u2018D\u2019you know what? This helped me.\u2019 I was very disappointed in Victoria, as a fellow cancer sufferer, that she wasn\u2019t curious. Pulse Electro Magnetism may have been able to help her as well. But instead she wanted to go back to an old Twitter row. It was cheap television.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of hours into our conversation, Edmonds says he wants to do an experiment on me. He asks me to stand up, place my arms by my side and resist as he tries to pull my right arm upwards. I feel like a contestant on House Party. As he pulls, he says loudly: \u201c<em>Resist. Resist. Resist.</em>\u201d Other diners are looking our way. I successfully resist and Edmonds says, \u201cGood.\u201d Then he fetches his mobile phone, tells me to hold it in my left hand, before grabbing my right arm and doing the whole \u201c<em>Resist. Resist. Resist</em>\u201d routine again. Only this time I find that I cannot: he pulls my arm up easily.</p> <p>Edmonds smiles in satisfaction. \u201cAnd people say that I\u2019m crazy because I believe in the human body\u2019s energy system,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I did was introduce a negative energy into your system [the phone] \u2013 but Noel Edmonds is fucking stupid and crazy!\u201d For a moment, anger flashes in his eyes. Then he switches into faux-zany, beaming at me intensely and saying: \u201cDo you know why I am stupid? Because I tried to share it with stupid people. Isn\u2019t it fun?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Brexit is the best example of how the regime needed to control the population by creating a distraction</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I ask him to explain exactly what he thinks just happened to my arm. \u201cNo, go off and learn,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause Noel Edmonds doesn\u2019t know all the answers \u2013 all he\u2019s done is go off, gather facts, acquire knowledge and he\u2019s formed an opinion.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s getting late but Edmonds is becoming more energised. \u201cI am on one now,\u201d he admits. What\u2019s his take on Brexit? \u201cBrexit is the best example of how the regime needed to control the population by creating a distraction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was, without a shadow of a doubt, created by the political elite \u2013 who, of course, are not the people we vote for, but the ones who really run the country. So for three years we are talking about this complete and absolute nonsense and not the real issues facing us.\u201d</p> <p>Who are these people running the country? \u201cThe people who are always there, whoever we vote for: the civil servants and bureaucrats.\u201d</p> <p>And what are the real issues facing us? \u201cWell, are you happy with the NHS? Are you happy with the schools? Are you happy with the roads or the high-speed train going to Birmingham that\u2019s 20 minutes quicker? When 14m people in Britain are living at or below the poverty line?\u201d</p> <p>In the past he has been quoted as saying that the country is full and can\u2019t afford to allow any more people in. He says that he has no party political allegiances, is no fan of Nigel Farage and that his comments had nothing to do with immigration. Can he clarify his position? He asks me how many people I think are living in the UK. I say I think it\u2019s around 65m (the current government estimate is 66.87m).</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he chuckles, almost sympathetically. \u201cWhy would you ever believe a number that has been produced by the people who said we were giving the EU \u00a3350m a week? It\u2019s a fiction. It\u2019s actually at least 75m.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him where he gets his information from. \u201cThere is a very simple way of working out for yourself what the real population of this country is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the three \u2018F\u2019s\u2019 \u2013 food, faeces and farewells. Food is very tightly regulated because it has to be, for obvious reasons. Faeces is the same. We know how much shit and piss is going through the system. And as for farewells \u2013 we have a pretty good idea how many people are buried or cremated each year.\u201d It doesn\u2019t quite explain how he has managed to accurately gauge the UK population, but this is classic Edmonds: creating a diversion, inventing an acronym and packaging it up in unswerving conviction.</p> <p>By now I am tired and confused, lost in the blizzard of Edmonds\u2019 rapid-fire theories. Like the consummate TV host he is, he has subtly turned the tables and started to fire questions back at me.</p> <p>Edmonds: How big is the food warehouse for the UK in the event that our country has a problem with food? How long can we survive if there is a blockade?</p> <p>Me: I don\u2019t know.</p> <p>Edmonds: Tell me!</p> <p>Me: I\u2019ve no idea.</p> <p>Edmonds: You can\u2019t say that. How old are you?</p> <p>Me: 44. Do you know what our food reserves are?</p> <p>Edmonds: Yes.</p> <p>Me: How?</p> <p>Edmonds: Because! (banging table) Facts! Knowledge! Opinion!</p> <p>The next morning Noel breezes into the Lloyds AGM. When eventually handed the microphone, he asks the aloof and clearly exasperated bank chairman, Lord Blackwell, if he is being fed his lines by lawyers via an earpiece, before demanding whether he is aware of the number of police investigations currently facing Lloyds (he isn\u2019t). It is unlikely that Edmonds is going to give up his fight. His doggedness is a problem for Lloyds, as is his relentless eccentricity \u2013 which only serves to amplify his campaign.</p> <p>It is easy to laugh at Noel Edmonds; people do it all the time. \u201cI know I confuse people \u2013 I\u2019m aware of how I am perceived,\u201d he says. But he doesn\u2019t care enough to stop. When challenged about his outlandish theories, Edmonds reacts with a mixture of hostility, exasperation and amusement. Despite all this, I like him. He is spiky, yes, but oddly charming with it. I don\u2019t believe in much of what he says, but I believe that he does, and that it probably helps him. So why wouldn\u2019t he share it? </p> <p>And that, in the end, is his secret. Edmonds has a cast-iron conviction in himself, in his ideas and in his belief that his audience will buy in to what he is saying. He could change the world. He could bring down a bank. It\u2019s already made him the longest-standing star in the history of British television. Blimey. </p> <p>\u2022 Noel Edmonds will be on a live tour of UK cinemas in August presenting Samir Mehanovic\u2019s documentary <a href=\"https://www.spankthebankerfilm.com/\" title=\"\">Spank The Banker</a></p> <p>If you would like a comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "In the courtyard outside an Edinburgh hotel, a boy barely in his teens excitedly asks Noel Edmonds for a selfie. The former presenter seems surprised, but it might be a bit of an act: he is, after all, one of the most recognisable faces in Britain. And since his brief but compelling turn on last year\u2019s I\u2019m A Celebrity\u2026 Get Me Out Of Here!, Edmonds\u2019 appeal has become what he calls \u201cintergenerational\u201d. His teenage stepson\u2019s mates have looked him up on YouTube and were, he says, wowed by his appearance \u201cintroducing a band at some massive gig at Wembley\u201d. (They mean Live Aid, where Edmonds\u2019 company also provided all of the helicopter transport.) So now he is familiar to the kids of 2019, as well as those of us who grew up with him in the 1970s (presenting Multi-Coloured Swap Shop and Top Of The Pops), 1980s (The Late Late Breakfast Show, Telly Addicts), 1990s (Noel\u2019s House Party) or 2000s (Deal Or No Deal). House Party, his madcap teatime show featuring sidekick Mr Blobby and the fictional village of Crinkley Bottom, reached a peak of 15 million viewers on BBC One. It is difficult to think of anyone else who has had so many mainstream hits, over such a long period of time. For a bloke who can\u2019t sing, dance, act or even really tell a joke, he\u2019s an unlikely king of British light entertainment. What is Noel Edmonds\u2019 secret? \u201cPeople are always asking me that,\u201d he says. \u201cI tell them to mind their own business. Go and learn something for yourself. Be curious, that\u2019s all I ask of people. I\u2019m not going to tell you where the gold is buried until you come over to my side.\u201d He says he doesn\u2019t watch much TV and isn\u2019t particularly bothered about being on it. A show with his Jungle sidekick Harry Redknapp is said to be in production, but, \u201cI have another life. I live in a lovely part of France. I have business interests in Dubai, Monaco and all over the world. If people think I am a failure because I am not on telly every day, that is their problem.\u201d Edmonds is in Edinburgh to attend Lloyds bank\u2019s AGM. His mission is to disrupt the event, just as he did last year, by cross-examining those at the top about the banking fraud that Edmonds blames for bringing down his production company, as well as at least 60 other businesses in the mid-00s. (A group of corrupt consultants colluded with Lynden Scourfield, a former manager at the Reading branch of HBOS, the bank later acquired by Lloyds, to load businesses with unmanageable debts, forcing them into administration, seizing their assets and spending the profits on exotic holidays and parties. They were given lengthy jail sentences in 2017.) Edmonds flew in from the south of France this morning excited by the prospect of causing chaos at an AGM that will be livestreamed around the world. Over dinner the night before, he sips at a glass of red wine. \u201cI\u2019ve got to keep a clear head for the morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got some great stuff up my sleeve.\u201d At 70, he is lithe and muscular, the beard and hairdo immaculate. His shirt is undone, 70s he-man style, to reveal a wooden pendant. When he was voted off I\u2019m A Celebrity, the tabloids called him a hunk. I tell Edmonds I once read he got up at 4am and worked out for four hours. \u201cOh fucking hell, fuck off!\u201d he exclaims. But he flexes a large bicep and places his arm on the table: \u201cDo you want to arm wrestle me?\u201d I tell him I don\u2019t want to risk losing to a 70-year-old in public. \u201cExactly,\u201d he beams. \u201cJust like my wife doesn\u2019t want to wake up next to someone who looks 70. So I work hard to keep in shape. I do something I call snackcercise.\u201d This, he explains, involves working your muscles to a point where they can\u2019t go on, then returning to that exercise 48 hours later. Stretching, he thinks, is a time-wasting con invented by personal trainers. In the three hours I spend with Edmonds, the effervescent and slightly mysterious man I grew up watching on TV is by turns charming, combative, sentimental, angry and playful. He is fond of referring to himself in the third person. He opines on anything and everything, from the BBC (\u201cIt will die in my lifetime. Sometimes you just have to accept that an illness is terminal,\u201d), to Nigel Farage (\u201cYou might as well ask me what I think about semolina!\u201d), to The Jeremy Kyle Show (\u201cIs this what TV shows are supposed to do now? Use the public as cannon fodder?\u201d), to animal rights (\u201cThere are pets dying every day because their owners can\u2019t afford the extortionate vets bills \u2013 and they are hassling ITV about the rights of the fucking insects on I\u2019m A Celebrity!\u201d). In 2016, he set up a pet counselling service, calling cats and dogs to offer them words of affirmation and positivity. After counselling a cat called Dana down the line on Jeremy Vine\u2019s Radio 2 show (\u201cFish Dana, you like fish, don\u2019t you?\u201d) he reportedly received 2,000 applications for help in four hours. By May 2019, however, there was no sign of the service on his website. For the first 30 years of Edmonds\u2019 career he maintained a studiously safe and middle-of-the-road persona. These days, he is almost as famous for his controversial opinions \u2013 about the benefits of pulse electromagnetism or the power of positive thought to tackle cancer (of which more later) \u2013 as he is for his presenting talents. Was this maverick Noel Edmonds always there, carefully hidden to preserve his status as Mr Saturday Night? Or did something change in his life to make him turn to all of this stuff? \u201cI was brought up to be loyal, trustworthy, hardworking and to deliver,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you hired Noel Edmonds to do something then, by God, he worked hard at it. When all the other Radio 1 DJs were larking about, I was hard at work preparing the content for my shows. Where are they now?\u201d So he was always competitive? \u201cExtremely,\u201d he says. With whom? \u201cMyself, probably.\u201d None of which really answers my question. \u201cMaybe I was always more than one person, or even two,\u201d he says. \u201cMaybe being on TV was just my job. People find it hard to get their heads around that.\u201d So work left no room for the rest of his personality? \u201cA couple of times I have shone a light on the other sides of my life, but I have learned to be cautious about that. Because people are only comfortable with the Noel Edmonds they see on television.\u201d One major turning point was the 2005 collapse of his entertainment company, Unique Group \u2013 an umbrella for various production companies that owned the rights to, among other things, Mr Blobby and Telly Addicts. But Edmonds remains dogged in his pursuit of Lloyds, whom he holds responsible, seeking \u00a360m in losses and damages. (Lloyds say they will dispute his claim if it gets to court.) Edmonds complained to the Advertising Standards Authority about the By Your Side Lloyds ad campaign, claiming it was hypocritical. The complaint wasn\u2019t upheld, but the acres of press coverage were damaging. In the past year, Edmonds has widened his campaign to investigate the role he says Lloyds and other banks have played in the closure of 100,000 businesses since the financial crisis, ultimately bringing about a decade of austerity. His YouTube channel Lloyds Victims has 1.8m subscribers, and last year he set up an online radio station, Positively Noel, inviting Lloyds staffers to blow the whistle in breaks between pertinent tracks such as Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel\u2019s Don\u2019t Give Up and LunchMoney Lewis\u2019 Bills. At around the same time his business collapsed, Edmonds\u2019 marriage to his second wife, Helen Soby, with whom he had four daughters, came to an end (he has since remarried, to Liz Davies, who worked as a makeup artist on Deal Or No Deal). \u201cIt was my rock bottom,\u201d he tells me. \u201cLet\u2019s be 100% clear about this: I tried to kill myself on January 18, 2005.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2017, 12 years later, that he spoke publicly of his suicide attempt. \u201cI was as guilty as most people of thinking that anyone who wanted to take their own life was selfish and ridiculous. But you really can\u2019t judge anyone until you\u2019ve been in that space,\u201d he says. After receiving treatment at the Priory hospital in Bristol, he slowly began to rebuild his life. It was around the same time that Edmonds discovered the idea of cosmic ordering, whereby he would write a list of requests to the universe and wait for them to come about. \u201cOf course it doesn\u2019t always work,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I actually think you can lead a happier life if you think, \u2018I wanted that to happen, I prayed for that to happen and if it didn\u2019t perhaps I have to accept that it just wasn\u2019t supposed to happen.\u2019 You don\u2019t just stop believing in something because it doesn\u2019t always work.\u201d Just months after his suicide attempt, Edmonds became the face of Deal Or No Deal, a daytime game show with a baffling set of rules: a contestant selected identical boxes from a row of 22, each of which contained a different sum of money (the maximum being \u00a3250,000). An anonymous \u201cbanker\u201d would communicate with the contestant by phone via Edmonds, making real-money offers to buy the boxes. It was, effectively, a simple guessing game \u2013 but Edmonds elevated it into drama so compelling that AA Gill described it as \u201clike putting heroin in your remote control\u201d. Other hosts might have been funny or lightly mocked the format, but Edmonds takes everything he does deeply seriously. Deal Or No Deal became one of Channel 4\u2019s most popular shows and Edmonds was nominated for a Bafta; it ran for a decade, before coming to an end in 2016. His campaign against Lloyds is partly a way of making a positive from a negative, but it must be stressful. Is he happy? \u201cThis is the happiest period in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff going on that I never thought Noel Edmonds would get involved with. I am going to ensure that the small group of UK bankers that brought 12 years of austerity and deprivation upon the British people will go to prison. And if that is my legacy, then I would prefer it to being Mr Blobby\u2019s friend.\u201d *** The only child of two teachers, Lydia and Dudley (Edmonds refers to them by their Christian names), he spent his childhood in Ilford, east London, and then the suburbs of Essex. It was a lower-middle-class upbringing, and his parents made sacrifices to send him to Brentwood, the public school, where Douglas Adams and Griff Rhys Jones were contemporaries. His early career was driven largely by a desire to impress his parents. \u201cWhen I was invited on Desert Island Discs by Roy Plomley [in 1978] my dad finally started to think that I had a proper job,\u201d he says. After sitting his A-levels, he had turned down a place at Surrey University. \u201cWhen I told my dad I was going to be a disc jockey in Luxembourg, I must have broken his heart. But he forgave me and just said, \u2018OK, go and be the best disc jockey there is.\u2019\u201d Edmonds was offered a job as a newsreader at Radio Luxembourg in 1968, after sending the offshore station tapes of himself. \u201cYou cannot imagine how exciting it was to be broadcasting pop music in the 60s,\u201d he says. \u201cThe BBC had been giving us just a couple of hours a week. Then suddenly these new pirate stations were playing it round the clock \u2013 it felt like we were in America.\u201d In 1969, aged 20, he became the youngest disc jockey Radio 1 had ever hired (a record that stood until 1999). Within a few years he was hosting the breakfast show and attracting over 10m daily listeners. His hero was Kenny Everett, whom he eventually replaced on Saturday mornings. \u201cI could never be as funny as Kenny, who was a genius,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I aspired to create the same amount of original content as him. That\u2019s what always drives me: creating stuff that will entertain people. And I put the hours in.\u201d Edmonds\u2019 shows were rich in the sort of segments that were rare at the time: prerecorded comic characters, prank phone calls and stunts. Was it a happy time? \u201cYes, it was fantastic \u2013 you\u2019re in your early 20s, all by yourself in the studio, talking to 14m people. I thought, if I come off air and I\u2019ve amused myself, then maybe it\u2019s worked.\u201d On Swap Shop, Edmonds broke the mould of patronising children\u2019s TV by presiding over an anarchic show in a T-shirt and long hair, freewheeling without a script or earpiece. On House Party, his Gotcha Oscars set the bar for celebrity pranking, a format that has been mimicked ever since (not least, and by their own admission, by Ant and Dec). House Party\u2019s NTV feature turned the cameras on viewers watching the show in their front rooms long before Gogglebox. Even if you didn\u2019t care for Edmonds, his ideas transcended his personality and drew audiences of millions. *** Edmonds says he remembers watching The Val Doonican Show with Lydia and Dudley at home in Essex, and telling them he was going to be a TV presenter. What made him so sure? \u201cI heard the other disc jockeys on Radio Caroline, and saw the other presenters on TV, and simply thought, \u2018I could do that,\u2019\u201d he says. Was he particularly funny or outgoing at school? \u201cNo, never. But I was never going to fit into a 1,000-boy school that was designed to just train people up for university. I\u2019ve always wanted to be different. I\u2019ve always had this huge positive energy around me.\u201d He has claimed in previous interviews that his parents, both now dead, accompany him in the form of melon-sized orbs wherever he goes. They certainly loom large in his conversation. \u201cWe formed a triangle, the three of us,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe triangle is a very important shape. But then the triangle was broken. And nobody sympathises with an orphan in their 60s.\u201d Maybe it is his desire to be taken seriously that has inspired Edmonds to investigate worlds less frivolous than Crinkley Bottom. In recent years his proclamations on electromagnetic energy (he has claimed it helped with his prostate cancer), cosmic ordering, and population control have generated both controversy and ridicule. But he insists that his comments have been taken out of context, and that his beliefs are rooted in research. He tells me he lives by a rule called FKO, which stands for facts, knowledge, opinion. \u201cFirst you get the facts and that gives you the knowledge to form an opinion,\u201d he says. \u201cI came up with the idea of FKO when people started calling me barmy.\u201d In 2016, Edmonds tweeted cancer patient Vaun Norman to ask him whether his illness might have been caused by negative thinking. Were people not justified in calling that, at the very least, \u201cbarmy\u201d? \u201cI was trying to generate curiosity,\u201d he says. \u201cThe starting point was me saying that pulsed electromagnetism had helped me tackle \u2013 not cure \u2013 my cancer. Wouldn\u2019t you think that, in a balanced media environment, people might think: \u2018That\u2019s interesting, let\u2019s have a dip into that?\u2019\u201d Edmonds was then invited on to This Morning to explain his comments: he told a sceptical Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that he had bought a \u00a32,315 device called an EMPpad which helped \u201ctackle\u201d cancer; he later explained it worked by \u201crecalibrating all the blood cells and readjusting the electromagnetism in your body\u201d. In a statement, EMPpad Ltd, manufacturers of the device, strongly distanced themselves from this claim. Last year, Victoria Derbyshire (who is in remission from breast cancer) confronted Edmonds about these claims on her BBC show. He later apologised to Norman, but remains unrepentant about the benefits of pulsed electromagnetism. \u201cThe idea that I said, \u2018I have a cure for cancer\u2019 \u2013 I mean, fuck off! If that were true I\u2019d own the whole world. All I said was: \u2018D\u2019you know what? This helped me.\u2019 I was very disappointed in Victoria, as a fellow cancer sufferer, that she wasn\u2019t curious. Pulse Electro Magnetism may have been able to help her as well. But instead she wanted to go back to an old Twitter row. It was cheap television.\u201d A couple of hours into our conversation, Edmonds says he wants to do an experiment on me. He asks me to stand up, place my arms by my side and resist as he tries to pull my right arm upwards. I feel like a contestant on House Party. As he pulls, he says loudly: \u201cResist. Resist. Resist.\u201d Other diners are looking our way. I successfully resist and Edmonds says, \u201cGood.\u201d Then he fetches his mobile phone, tells me to hold it in my left hand, before grabbing my right arm and doing the whole \u201cResist. Resist. Resist\u201d routine again. Only this time I find that I cannot: he pulls my arm up easily. Edmonds smiles in satisfaction. \u201cAnd people say that I\u2019m crazy because I believe in the human body\u2019s energy system,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I did was introduce a negative energy into your system [the phone] \u2013 but Noel Edmonds is fucking stupid and crazy!\u201d For a moment, anger flashes in his eyes. Then he switches into faux-zany, beaming at me intensely and saying: \u201cDo you know why I am stupid? Because I tried to share it with stupid people. Isn\u2019t it fun?\u201d I ask him to explain exactly what he thinks just happened to my arm. \u201cNo, go off and learn,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause Noel Edmonds doesn\u2019t know all the answers \u2013 all he\u2019s done is go off, gather facts, acquire knowledge and he\u2019s formed an opinion.\u201d It\u2019s getting late but Edmonds is becoming more energised. \u201cI am on one now,\u201d he admits. What\u2019s his take on Brexit? \u201cBrexit is the best example of how the regime needed to control the population by creating a distraction,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was, without a shadow of a doubt, created by the political elite \u2013 who, of course, are not the people we vote for, but the ones who really run the country. So for three years we are talking about this complete and absolute nonsense and not the real issues facing us.\u201d Who are these people running the country? \u201cThe people who are always there, whoever we vote for: the civil servants and bureaucrats.\u201d And what are the real issues facing us? \u201cWell, are you happy with the NHS? Are you happy with the schools? Are you happy with the roads or the high-speed train going to Birmingham that\u2019s 20 minutes quicker? When 14m people in Britain are living at or below the poverty line?\u201d In the past he has been quoted as saying that the country is full and can\u2019t afford to allow any more people in. He says that he has no party political allegiances, is no fan of Nigel Farage and that his comments had nothing to do with immigration. Can he clarify his position? He asks me how many people I think are living in the UK. I say I think it\u2019s around 65m (the current government estimate is 66.87m). \u201cNo, it\u2019s not,\u201d he chuckles, almost sympathetically. \u201cWhy would you ever believe a number that has been produced by the people who said we were giving the EU \u00a3350m a week? It\u2019s a fiction. It\u2019s actually at least 75m.\u201d I ask him where he gets his information from. \u201cThere is a very simple way of working out for yourself what the real population of this country is,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s the three \u2018F\u2019s\u2019 \u2013 food, faeces and farewells. Food is very tightly regulated because it has to be, for obvious reasons. Faeces is the same. We know how much shit and piss is going through the system. And as for farewells \u2013 we have a pretty good idea how many people are buried or cremated each year.\u201d It doesn\u2019t quite explain how he has managed to accurately gauge the UK population, but this is classic Edmonds: creating a diversion, inventing an acronym and packaging it up in unswerving conviction. By now I am tired and confused, lost in the blizzard of Edmonds\u2019 rapid-fire theories. Like the consummate TV host he is, he has subtly turned the tables and started to fire questions back at me. Edmonds: How big is the food warehouse for the UK in the event that our country has a problem with food? How long can we survive if there is a blockade? Me: I don\u2019t know. Edmonds: Tell me! Me: I\u2019ve no idea. Edmonds: You can\u2019t say that. How old are you? Me: 44. Do you know what our food reserves are? Edmonds: Yes. Me: How? Edmonds: Because! (banging table) Facts! Knowledge! Opinion! The next morning Noel breezes into the Lloyds AGM. When eventually handed the microphone, he asks the aloof and clearly exasperated bank chairman, Lord Blackwell, if he is being fed his lines by lawyers via an earpiece, before demanding whether he is aware of the number of police investigations currently facing Lloyds (he isn\u2019t). It is unlikely that Edmonds is going to give up his fight. His doggedness is a problem for Lloyds, as is his relentless eccentricity \u2013 which only serves to amplify his campaign. It is easy to laugh at Noel Edmonds; people do it all the time. \u201cI know I confuse people \u2013 I\u2019m aware of how I am perceived,\u201d he says. But he doesn\u2019t care enough to stop. When challenged about his outlandish theories, Edmonds reacts with a mixture of hostility, exasperation and amusement. Despite all this, I like him. He is spiky, yes, but oddly charming with it. I don\u2019t believe in much of what he says, but I believe that he does, and that it probably helps him. So why wouldn\u2019t he share it? And that, in the end, is his secret. Edmonds has a cast-iron conviction in himself, in his ideas and in his belief that his audience will buy in to what he is saying. He could change the world. He could bring down a bank. It\u2019s already made him the longest-standing star in the history of British television. Blimey. \u2022 Noel Edmonds will be on a live tour of UK cinemas in August presenting Samir Mehanovic\u2019s documentary Spank The Banker If you would like a comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

Similarly: if a six-years-on-hiatus boyband release a comeback single without a 90-minute documentary about how difficult it was spending six years in the wilderness being not quite as famous as they were when they were properly famous, have they even come back at all? A question asked and answered by Chasing Happiness (Amazon Prime Video, from Tuesday), in which the Jonas Brothers tell us: hey, we have come back.</p> <p>I mean, it\u2019s not quite as harrowing a story as they\u2019d like you to believe. Happiness charts the Jonas Brothers\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s Nick, a preternaturally gifted musical savant with the voice of an angel; Joe, an electric bolt of charisma with eyebrows you would build an army for; and Kevin, who tries very hard! \u2013 rise to fame, the unrelenting pressure of fame once they got it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/30/jonas-brothers-announce-split-over-rift\" title=\"\">the difficult breakup</a>, the post-fame, still-famous years spent Figuring Stuff Out, and their difficult collective decision to reunite and become more famous and make more money again.

The first half of Chasing Happiness really wants to drill into us the idea that the Jonas Brothers weren\u2019t a fluke, or a result of Disney manufacture, or a gift from God, or any of that; no, they hustled hard to make it to the top. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up with much,\u201d each brother says, separately and repeatedly, each glossing over the fact that their ex-pastor father plunged $90,000 of his savings into paying for them to tour the country with a band to get their career off the ground. A middle-of-the-doc dramatic moment \u2013 where the brothers, dropped from their first label, have to briefly move to a smaller house \u2013 is shattered when the cheerful Joe Jonas reveals: \u201cAnd then the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/mar/17/disney-channel-uk-tv-mini-series-evermoor\">Disney Channel</a> called us and said: \u2018We know you need something. We\u2019re going to give you a record deal.\u2019\u201d How do we struggle on in our lives? Do we simply not have the number for the Disney Channel?</p> <p>It\u2019s the current-day footage of the Three Horseman of the Jonas that is most fascinating, though, because they say nothing. Joe, the middle Jonas, seems happiest with his lot, after forming a fun spin-off band and marrying Sophie Turner off of Game of Thrones. You can\u2019t really ask for better than that, can you? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/09/nick-jonas-last-year-was-complicated-review-single-sad-and-highly-sexed-pop\">Nick</a> is the most tired-of-being-alive 26-year-old ever committed to film.

      "bodyText": "If a tree falls in the forest and nobody is around to hear it, did it make a sound? Similarly: if a six-years-on-hiatus boyband release a comeback single without a 90-minute documentary about how difficult it was spending six years in the wilderness being not quite as famous as they were when they were properly famous, have they even come back at all? A question asked and answered by Chasing Happiness (Amazon Prime Video, from Tuesday), in which the Jonas Brothers tell us: hey, we have come back. I mean, it\u2019s not quite as harrowing a story as they\u2019d like you to believe. Happiness charts the Jonas Brothers\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s Nick, a preternaturally gifted musical savant with the voice of an angel; Joe, an electric bolt of charisma with eyebrows you would build an army for; and Kevin, who tries very hard! \u2013 rise to fame, the unrelenting pressure of fame once they got it, the difficult breakup, the post-fame, still-famous years spent Figuring Stuff Out, and their difficult collective decision to reunite and become more famous and make more money again. But essentially their story is: they wrote, like, one song and Disney signed them to a lifetime deal, and then they all married beautiful, successful women. The End. Well, it\u2019s more complex than that, but barely. The first half of Chasing Happiness really wants to drill into us the idea that the Jonas Brothers weren\u2019t a fluke, or a result of Disney manufacture, or a gift from God, or any of that; no, they hustled hard to make it to the top. \u201cWe didn\u2019t grow up with much,\u201d each brother says, separately and repeatedly, each glossing over the fact that their ex-pastor father plunged $90,000 of his savings into paying for them to tour the country with a band to get their career off the ground. A middle-of-the-doc dramatic moment \u2013 where the brothers, dropped from their first label, have to briefly move to a smaller house \u2013 is shattered when the cheerful Joe Jonas reveals: \u201cAnd then the Disney Channel called us and said: \u2018We know you need something. We\u2019re going to give you a record deal.\u2019\u201d How do we struggle on in our lives? Do we simply not have the number for the Disney Channel? It\u2019s the current-day footage of the Three Horseman of the Jonas that is most fascinating, though, because they say nothing. Joe, the middle Jonas, seems happiest with his lot, after forming a fun spin-off band and marrying Sophie Turner off of Game of Thrones. You can\u2019t really ask for better than that, can you? Nick is the most tired-of-being-alive 26-year-old ever committed to film. And Kevin \u2013 who, even during his peak as a rock star and teen sex icon, still had palpable \u201cdad waiting in a car after karate lessons\u201d energy about him \u2013 basically spends his days making pancakes for his children and getting left on read by his brothers. As comeback documentaries go, it\u2019s a suitably flattering portrait of a band looking to tour again.

Its author describes himself or herself as \u201can experienced carder, carding tens of thousands of dollars worth of merchandise and rarely failing,\u201d adding: \u201cWant to know how to get free goods? Let\u2019s get started!\u201d Featurespace says that with the help of privacy software, \u201copportunistic amateur fraudsters are now able to enrol in comprehensive classes and take modules \u2013 from tips on who the easiest issuers and banks are to defraud, all the way up to learning how to perpetrate large-scale credit card fraud\u201d. In March, banking body UK Finance revealed that so-called \u201ccard not present\u201d or \u201cremote purchase\u201d fraud, where a criminal uses stolen card details to buy on the internet or over the phone, leapt by 24% to hit \u00a3506m in 2018. \u201cAs more of this fraud is now being perpetrated by clued-up amateurs working out of their bedrooms, they are harder for financial institutions to spot and stop \u2013 their spending patterns often mimic those of their victims,\u201d says the firm.Sean Neary, its senior product officer, adds that many of these criminals \u2013 dubbed \u201cfraud boys\u201d in some circles \u2013 focus on what they view as smaller, easier scams such as ordering pizzas and other relatively low-value items. \u201cIt\u2019s a different demographic of people now in the fraud industry,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cThis is the new way of buying stolen goods.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>Quiz question: which is the oldest city in Finland and became the capital in 1809? No, not Helsinki \u2013 Turku. This south-western city, little-known to UK travellers, was the most important in Finland for hundreds of years. Now, 200 years after the end of its golden age, it is having a renaissance, with new bars and restaurants opening, and direct flights starting from Luton. My partner and I went for a long weekend, tempted by the riverside setting, its self-styled status as the Finnish food capital \u2013 and the 20,000 islands on its doorstep.</p> <p>Any visit to Turku must start at the <strong>River Aura</strong>, which flows through it and divides the city into \u201cthis side\u201d and \u201cthe other side\u201d. On \u201cthis side\u201d is the medieval cathedral and several lively boat bars; \u201cthe other side\u201d is home to the castle and dozens of restaurants. Car-free boulevards run along both banks of the river, thronged with pedestrians, cyclists and sunbathers (it was a balmy 25C in May). Ten bridges cross the water, and a free ferry, the F\u00f6ri, has been chugging back and forth since 1903. There\u2019s no old town to hang out in \u2013 Turku lost most of its historic buildings in the Great Fire of 1827 \u2013 but the flower-filled riverbanks do the job nicely. We rented an electric picnic boat and cruised down to the river\u2019s mouth and back in about an hour (\u20ac59 an hour, up to eight people, <a href=\"https://www.lanaturku.fi/?lang=en\" title=\"\">lanaturku.fi</a>).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/may/2019-05-30T14:17:07.html\" data-alt=\"Map of Europe showing Turku in Finland.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/may/2019-05-30T14:17:07.html\">Map of Europe showing Turku in Finland.</a> </figure>  <p>Turku prides itself on its food scene. Many of the best restaurants are on the riverfront, but the most highly rated, <strong><a href=\"https://www.kaskis.fi/en/\" title=\"\">Kaskis</a></strong>, is a short walk away up one of the city\u2019s seven small hills. It\u2019s worth booking well ahead \u2013 we could only get a table for the first sitting, at 4pm. Set four-, five- and six-course menus (\u20ac59-\u20ac69) come with optional matching wines (\u20ac37-\u20ac47). The focus is on fresh Nordic flavours, with many ingredients from Finnish forests. The spring menu included pike perch, asparagus, lamb and rhubarb; I especially liked a dish of cabbage topped with shaved reindeer heart. While we ate, we watched a small girl outside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/apr/30/hobbyhorsing-what-girls-everywhere-can-learn-from-the-finnish-craze\" title=\"\">practising on her hobby horse</a>, a popular Finnish pastime.</p> <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.smor.fi/eng/\" title=\"\">Sm\u00f6r</a></strong>, a cosy restaurant in former vaults by the river, has a similar ethos to Kaskis, serving five- and seven-course tasting menus (\u20ac62/\u20ac72) with wine flights (\u20ac48/\u20ac58). We sampled delicate dishes such as trout with mussels, radishes and broad beans but, for pure deliciousness, it was hard to beat a plate of crispy chicken skin. It isn\u2019t all new Nordic fine dining, though. <strong><a href=\"https://www.mami.fi/\" title=\"\">Mami</a></strong> serves a daily-changing home-style lunch menu, including liver on Fridays (mains around \u20ac10). <strong><a href=\"https://ravintolaaune.fi/\" title=\"\">Aune</a></strong> is one of the few places to open on Sundays and serves great burgers (meat and veggie, \u20ac17). <strong><a href=\"https://hugge.fi/\" title=\"\">H\u00fcgge</a></strong> is a popular vegetarian restaurant, <strong><a href=\"https://bassi.fi/\" title=\"\">Bassi</a></strong> is a new seafood specialist and <strong><a href=\"http://www.rioni.fi/\" title=\"\">Rioni</a></strong> serves Georgian food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a140efe0e25896ed3899ae5c1c2b51b769b4700\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a140efe0e25896ed3899ae5c1c2b51b769b4700/114_72_1875_1125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vegetarian food at Hugge in Turku.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vegetarian food at Hugge in Turku</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A new foodie district is emerging a 15-minute walk from the centre in the unlikely surroundings of an old prison. Kakola Prison, on top of Kakolanm\u00e4ki Hill, opened in 1853 and was a notorious spot until its closure in 2007. The vast building stood empty for a decade, but now the team behind Kaskis has opened a restaurant there, <strong><a href=\"https://kakolanruusu.fi/en/\" title=\"\">Kakolanruusu</a></strong>, serving food cooked over an open fire and designed for sharing, such as lamb chops with burnt aubergine (\u20ac28). The restaurant has been joined by the <strong><a href=\"https://kakolabrewing.com/\" title=\"\">Kakola Brewing Company</a></strong> \u2013 which has a terrace and tiny bar, and is building a taproom \u2013 and a roastery: <strong><a href=\"https://fruktcoffeeroasters.com/\" title=\"\">Fru</a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://fruktcoffeeroasters.com/\" title=\"\">kt Coffee Roasters</a></strong>. A bakery is opening soon and a hotel and spa is planned for next year. There is also a prison museum, walking tours over the summer, and a free new funicular.</p> <p>Turku has two universities and about 35,000 students, so there is a lively bar scene. While the boat bars are an institution, and there are fun summer pop-ups, such as the <strong><a href=\"https://surfshackturku.business.site/\" title=\"\">Surf Shack</a></strong>, older drinkers might prefer the historic pubs.

We also strolled to the atmospheric <strong><a href=\"http://www.turku.fi/en/handicraftsmuseum\" title=\"\">Handicrafts Museum</a></strong>, an open-air museum of original wooden houses in the Luostarinm\u00e4ki quarter, one of the few areas to survive the fire. Tourists can visit 12 of Turku\u2019s museums over three days with a \u20ac38 Museum Walk card (and a bit of stamina).</p> <p>For shopping, the city has a good selection of vintage clothes shops and design stores such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.kuidesign.fi/\" title=\"\">Kui Design</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"http://www.terraviiva.fi/en/\" title=\"\">Terraviiva</a></strong>, which sells gorgeous handmade ceramics.

      "bodyText": "Quiz question: which is the oldest city in Finland and became the capital in 1809? No, not Helsinki \u2013 Turku. This south-western city, little-known to UK travellers, was the most important in Finland for hundreds of years. Now, 200 years after the end of its golden age, it is having a renaissance, with new bars and restaurants opening, and direct flights starting from Luton. My partner and I went for a long weekend, tempted by the riverside setting, its self-styled status as the Finnish food capital \u2013 and the 20,000 islands on its doorstep. Any visit to Turku must start at the River Aura, which flows through it and divides the city into \u201cthis side\u201d and \u201cthe other side\u201d. On \u201cthis side\u201d is the medieval cathedral and several lively boat bars; \u201cthe other side\u201d is home to the castle and dozens of restaurants. Car-free boulevards run along both banks of the river, thronged with pedestrians, cyclists and sunbathers (it was a balmy 25C in May). Ten bridges cross the water, and a free ferry, the F\u00f6ri, has been chugging back and forth since 1903. There\u2019s no old town to hang out in \u2013 Turku lost most of its historic buildings in the Great Fire of 1827 \u2013 but the flower-filled riverbanks do the job nicely. We rented an electric picnic boat and cruised down to the river\u2019s mouth and back in about an hour (\u20ac59 an hour, up to eight people, lanaturku.fi). Turku prides itself on its food scene. Many of the best restaurants are on the riverfront, but the most highly rated, Kaskis, is a short walk away up one of the city\u2019s seven small hills. It\u2019s worth booking well ahead \u2013 we could only get a table for the first sitting, at 4pm. Set four-, five- and six-course menus (\u20ac59-\u20ac69) come with optional matching wines (\u20ac37-\u20ac47). The focus is on fresh Nordic flavours, with many ingredients from Finnish forests. The spring menu included pike perch, asparagus, lamb and rhubarb; I especially liked a dish of cabbage topped with shaved reindeer heart. While we ate, we watched a small girl outside practising on her hobby horse, a popular Finnish pastime. Sm\u00f6r, a cosy restaurant in former vaults by the river, has a similar ethos to Kaskis, serving five- and seven-course tasting menus (\u20ac62/\u20ac72) with wine flights (\u20ac48/\u20ac58). We sampled delicate dishes such as trout with mussels, radishes and broad beans but, for pure deliciousness, it was hard to beat a plate of crispy chicken skin. It isn\u2019t all new Nordic fine dining, though. Mami serves a daily-changing home-style lunch menu, including liver on Fridays (mains around \u20ac10). Aune is one of the few places to open on Sundays and serves great burgers (meat and veggie, \u20ac17). H\u00fcgge is a popular vegetarian restaurant, Bassi is a new seafood specialist and Rioni serves Georgian food. A new foodie district is emerging a 15-minute walk from the centre in the unlikely surroundings of an old prison. Kakola Prison, on top of Kakolanm\u00e4ki Hill, opened in 1853 and was a notorious spot until its closure in 2007. The vast building stood empty for a decade, but now the team behind Kaskis has opened a restaurant there, Kakolanruusu, serving food cooked over an open fire and designed for sharing, such as lamb chops with burnt aubergine (\u20ac28). The restaurant has been joined by the Kakola Brewing Company \u2013 which has a terrace and tiny bar, and is building a taproom \u2013 and a roastery: Frukt Coffee Roasters. A bakery is opening soon and a hotel and spa is planned for next year. There is also a prison museum, walking tours over the summer, and a free new funicular. Turku has two universities and about 35,000 students, so there is a lively bar scene. While the boat bars are an institution, and there are fun summer pop-ups, such as the Surf Shack, older drinkers might prefer the historic pubs. The Old Bank has live music on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays; Uusi Apteekki is a bar in a former pharmacy; and Panimoravintola Koulu is a brewpub in a grand old school. Turku\u2019s first rooftop bar, Walo, has just opened on the 10th floor of the Wiklund hotel and is this summer\u2019s hotspot. Bassi has a speakeasy-style club above the restaurant, open on Fridays and Saturdays until 4am. Look out for happy hours \u2013 drinking here is expensive. Turku was European capital of culture in 2011 (jointly with Tallinn in Estonia), and has a great range of small museums. We visited the Turku Art Museum, showing mainly Finnish masters; the Sibelius Museum, with an engaging exhibition on the composer\u2019s life and work; the W\u00e4in\u00f6 Aaltonen Museum, named after the Turku-based sculptor, whose work can also be seen around town; and the Aboa Vetus &amp; Ars Nova, a two-in-one museum displaying contemporary art and archaeological finds. We also strolled to the atmospheric Handicrafts Museum, an open-air museum of original wooden houses in the Luostarinm\u00e4ki quarter, one of the few areas to survive the fire. Tourists can visit 12 of Turku\u2019s museums over three days with a \u20ac38 Museum Walk card (and a bit of stamina). For shopping, the city has a good selection of vintage clothes shops and design stores such as Kui Design and Terraviiva, which sells gorgeous handmade ceramics. The Market Hall was designed by architect Gustaf Nystr\u00f6m (who also designed the art museum) and opened in 1896; sadly, the huge Market Square is being dug up to allow for a controversial underground car park. We stayed in the newly reopened Turun Seurahuone hotel, which was designed by another leading architect, Erik Bryggman, in Nordic classicist style in the 1920s. It has been stylishly restored and serves a fantastic buffet breakfast, including salmon, local cheeses and several varieties of rye bread (doubles from \u00a3148 B&amp;B, sokoshotels.fi). The city itself is only one of Turku\u2019s selling points \u2013 the other is its archipelago of about 20,000 islands. Many are connected by the circular Archipelago Trail, a 200km network of roads, bridges and free ferries, ideal for a road trip or cycle tour. We spent a day exploring the islands, where many Turku residents have summer cottages. We tucked into a platter of shrimps, herring and salmon at Sattmark in Parainen (Pargas in Swedish; the archipelago is bilingual), then headed to Nauvo/Nagu, a tourist centre that can be reached by bus from Turku. This is a good place to hire bikes or kayaks, and is on the St Olav Waterway, a new pilgrimage route from Turku to Trondheim in Norway. We took a boat trip around the islands, which are low-lying and thickly forested, with small cabins peeping through the trees. They don\u2019t have the drama of Norway\u2019s fjords, but have a serene beauty. The archipelago gets busy in high summer, but in spring we saw only a few sailing boats and a couple of kayakers. Humans were outnumbered by birds, including a mighty sea eagle. Our destination was Tackork, a berry farm with glass-roofed huts to stay in, and a traditional Finnish smoke sauna. One day wasn\u2019t nearly long enough; I\u2019d happily spend several here, kayaking and wild camping (allowed under Finland\u2019s everyman\u2019s right). Back in the city, we had a final stroll along the river.

      "body": "<p>For five decades, Tales of the City has been life-affirming, life-changing and even life-saving. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/20/armistead-maupin-logical-family-interview\">Armistead Maupin\u2019s</a> books, which began as a newspaper column in 1976, took readers inside the daydream world of Barbary Lane, where the matriarch and landlady Mrs Madrigal presided over a group of friends and lovers in San Francisco \u2013 straight, gay, cisgender and transgender \u2013 at a time when queer life was rarely depicted outside of queer circles. The series concluded with a ninth instalment, The Days of Anna Madrigal, in 2014, but there is new life for these characters in the form of a glossy, hypercolour Netflix TV revival, or reimagining, depending on who you talk to. It is rare that a fictional universe is held quite so dearly as the world of Mouse, Mary Ann and Mrs Madrigal. Maupin knows it all too well. \u201cAll I have to do is go out in Soho to a bar, and, <em>my </em><em>God</em>!\u201d he exclaims.</p> <p>The author admits that he had some apprehension about allowing a new version to be adapted. \u201cI was nervous,\u201d he concedes. \u201cTurning your baby over to these other people, and God knows what they\u2019re going to do to it \u2026 \u201d But he soon realised it was safe with the (mostly) younger generation of new writers and directors. \u201cSoon as I saw the scripts, I knew they were not only on the right track, they were going to make me sound hipper than I was,\u201d he chuckles. Maupin is 75, and has recently relocated to London with his husband for what he calls \u201ca last chapter that is different\u201d.

      "bodyText": "For five decades, Tales of the City has been life-affirming, life-changing and even life-saving. Armistead Maupin\u2019s books, which began as a newspaper column in 1976, took readers inside the daydream world of Barbary Lane, where the matriarch and landlady Mrs Madrigal presided over a group of friends and lovers in San Francisco \u2013 straight, gay, cisgender and transgender \u2013 at a time when queer life was rarely depicted outside of queer circles. The series concluded with a ninth instalment, The Days of Anna Madrigal, in 2014, but there is new life for these characters in the form of a glossy, hypercolour Netflix TV revival, or reimagining, depending on who you talk to. It is rare that a fictional universe is held quite so dearly as the world of Mouse, Mary Ann and Mrs Madrigal. Maupin knows it all too well. \u201cAll I have to do is go out in Soho to a bar, and, my God!\u201d he exclaims. The author admits that he had some apprehension about allowing a new version to be adapted. \u201cI was nervous,\u201d he concedes. \u201cTurning your baby over to these other people, and God knows what they\u2019re going to do to it \u2026 \u201d But he soon realised it was safe with the (mostly) younger generation of new writers and directors. \u201cSoon as I saw the scripts, I knew they were not only on the right track, they were going to make me sound hipper than I was,\u201d he chuckles. Maupin is 75, and has recently relocated to London with his husband for what he calls \u201ca last chapter that is different\u201d. The move has coincided with a revived interest in Tales of the City, which first came to the small screen as a pioneering Channel 4 miniseries in 1993, and has been revived sporadically ever since. \u201cOver the past 25 years it would bubble up,\u201d says Laura Linney, who executive-produced the new series and has played the \u201cperpetual Alice in Wonderland\u201d character of Mary Ann Singleton since the first book made its way to Channel 4.

      "bodyText": "And this is where I must leave you for today. There will be two cricket blogs later from the World Cup, first on the New Zealand versus Sri Lanka game, then on the Australia versus Afghanistan match. And, of course, there will be a live blog of the Liverpool versus Tottenham Champions League final. I will be back tomorrow afternoon. The Guardian\u2019s coverage of the Adam Goodes film was mentioned below in the comments. If you are wondering what it is about, have a read of Luke Buckmaster\u2019s review: AFL: the home side has a goal advantage in Geelong in what has been an enthralling encounter so far, with Lance Franklin having a fine match. At half-time it\u2019s: Cats 7.2 (44).5.8 (38) Swans. AFL: the visitors from Sydney are trailing at the end of the first quarter in Geelong. At quarter-time it\u2019s Cats 5.1 (31).3.3 (21) Swans. This goal is a thing of beauty, by the way. Super Netball: it\u2019s all over in the Sunshine Coast, with the visitors from Victoria emerging victorious. Final score: Lightning 52-62 Vixens. From AAP: Vixens crash Langman\u2019s netball milestone Laura Langman\u2019s 200th elite game will not be remembered fondly by the New Zealand international after the Melbourne Vixens squeezed the life out of her Sunshine Coast Lightning in their Super Netball showdown. Swarming defence paved the way for the 62-52 victory and ruined the atmosphere for the home crowd who had packed USC Stadium to celebrate Langman\u2019s milestone on Saturday. Vixens shooter Caitlin Thwaites scored 33 goals while her Vixens captain Kate Moloney responded determinedly to her Diamonds\u2019 World Cup squad omission by winning her midcourt battle with Silver Ferns\u2019 veteran Langman. The Vixens overcame a slow start to claim the bonus points on offer for winning the first term. Their midcourt defence restricted Langman\u2019s influence as the attack line scored the last seven goals of the quarter. The defensive crunch was both brilliantly conceived and executed. Melbourne\u2019s Renae Ingles\u2019 performance was not statistically significant, but she clogged the central space normally controlled by Langman and snapped her connection with the Lightning\u2019s shooters. Such was the effectiveness of the shutdown engineered by Ingles and Jo Weston, the Lightning completely restructured their attack in the third quarter. Goal attack Steph Wood moved out to wing attack to facilitate a goal circle partnership between Peace Proscovia and Cara Koenen but the back-to-back championships could not regain the momentum. Super Rugby: it\u2019s good news for the visitors in Tokyo, with the Brumbies dominating the locals, despite going behind early in the game. It was a vital win and finals probably beckon after this. Final score: Sunwolves 19-42 Brumbies. From AAP: Brumbies look set for Super Rugby finals The Brumbies have all but guaranteed their Super Rugby finals spot, capitalising on the Rebels\u2019 upset loss to the NSW Waratahs to beat the Sunwolves in Tokyo. The Brumbies\u2019 42-19 bonus-point win on Saturday takes them to 39 points on the ladder, five clear of Melbourne with two games to play. Second-year coach Dan McKellar, an unknown when the former ACT forwards\u2019 assistant had replaced Stephen Larkham in 2018, has returned the Brumbies to form. They have been without the best openside flanker in the world David Pocock for most to the season but have still found a way to win. The Sunwolves are anchored to the bottom of the ladder but have beaten the Waratahs and Chiefs this season and had posed a danger to the Canberra outfit. The home side scored the first try when the \u201cTongan Godzilla\u201d Hosea Saumaki broke through in the opening minute but the Brumbies quickly responded. Wallabies No.8 Pete Samu squared the ledger in the ninth minute before Irae Simone and Tom Banks scored from backline moves inside the half-hour. Brumbies super-sub Connal McInerney replaced hooker Folau Faingaa at halftime and scored a hat-trick in the second half, all from rolling mauls. He had never scored a Super Rugby try and becomes the fifth player in Super Rugby history to score three off the bench. The Brumbies next face the Waratahs before hosting Queensland in the final round. Super Netball: it\u2019s three quarter-time in Sunshine Coast and the home side have fallen well behind to the visitors from Melbourne. It\u2019s Lightning 35-48 Vixens. AFL: an emphatic win for the home side at Sydney Showground. It finished GWS 19.12 (126) beat Gold Coast 6.7 (43). From AAP: Coniglio, Cameron star as GWS smack Suns GWS vice-captain Stephen Coniglio gave a timely reminder of his AFL value at Giants Stadium on Saturday, where five goals from Jeremy Cameron helped the hosts hammer Gold Coast by 83 points. Cameron, Jeremy Finlayson and Harry Himmelberg combined for 10 goals as GWS shored up their top-four spot, prevailing 19.12 (126) to 6.7 (43) in front of a crowd of 7,581. Coniglio, who comes off contract at the end of this season, was best on ground with 36 disposals, eight tackles, three clearances and three goals. The foundation Giant has been linked to clubs in Melbourne but GWS coach Leon Cameron is confident the in-demand on-baller will pen a new deal within a month. The Suns were in the contest at halftime, trailing by 19 points, but GWS proceeded to grow their percentage thanks to their potent multi-pronged forward line and the class of midfielders Coniglio, Josh Kelly, Jacob Hopper and Tim Taranto. The only downside for the Giants was that stars Lachie Whitfield and Toby Greene both failed to run out the game. Whitfield suffered a painful knock to his collarbone and shoulder in the fourth quarter when he was bumped by Gold Coast midfielder David Swallow. Whitfield emerged from the rooms towards the end of the match in good spirits - and without a sling. \u201cHe was a little bit sore but I think he\u2019ll be fine. He\u2019s a special player, cops a lot of attention most weeks and I\u2019m grateful he\u2019s on our side,\u201d Coniglio told Fox Footy. Greene played no part in the fourth quarter. Jeremy Cameron, having booted a combined total of three goals in the preceding three matches, featured prominently as the Giants booted 9.5 in a lopsided final term. Gold Coast\u2019s Jack Bowes suffered a quad injury in the first quarter and played no further part in the match. AFL: wow, what a finish that was. In a game where the lead changed often, Michael Walters got the decisive score for the visitors from the west. It finished Collingwood 11.9 (75) 11.13 (79) Fremantle. From AAP: Late Freo charge snaps Magpies AFL streak Fremantle have pulled off a stunning four-point win over Collingwood, Michael Walters the hero again with a goal to put his side in front with less than 30 seconds left at the MCG. Saturday\u2019s 11.13 (79) to 11.9 (75) will be much-debated after a Walters\u2019 goal in the third quarter wasn\u2019t overturned by the score reviewer despite it appearing to be touched off the boot by Chris Mayne. Steele Sidebottom\u2019s desperate lunge was clearly over the goal line but in a game decided by less than a kick, the Magpies appear hard done by. Collingwood, who were aiming to make it eight wins in a row, led by as much as nine points in a frantic final term but Brandon Matera kicked two goals to keep his side in it. As the clock ticked down, Nat Fyfe mistimed a torpedo punt that fell fortuitously into Walters lap inside attacking 50, the Dockers star winning a game off his own boot for the second week running. In a scrappy contest where errors came thick and fast, the few players who were able to maintain their composure and execute skills under pressure stood out more than they usually would. Brad Hill (29 possessions) and Fyfe (32) were those players for Fremantle, while Scott Pendlebury\u2019s class shone out for the Pies, the skipper finishing with 29 touches and two goals. Scores were level at the first break, but Jordan De Goey\u2019s brilliant second goal helped the Pies to a 13-point lead at halftime. The visitors looked set to break the game open with four goals in a row in the third quarter, but De Goey\u2019s third late helped slice the margin to four points at the last change, setting up a pulsating finish. Fremantle finished a player down after Alex Pearce limped off with an ankle injury and failed to return for the final term. Collingwood will next take on Melbourne in the Queen\u2019s Birthday clash, with the Dockers one of six teams not in action as the AFL\u2019s bye rounds commence. OK, this post isn\u2019t anything to do with sport, but it caught my eye because I found it just plain odd. Musicians are no longer just (allegedly) smoking marijuana, they\u2019re selling it. Super Netball: it\u2019s half-time in Sunshine Coast and the home side are trailing. It\u2019s Lightning 25-32 Vixens. Super Rugby: it\u2019s half-time in Tokyo, and despite taking an early lead, the hometown boys are trailing the visitors from Canberra. It\u2019s Sunwolves 12-21 Brumbies. Super Netball: it is 13 minutes to half-time in Sunshine Coast, with the latest score Lightning 15-18 Vixens. AFL: it\u2019s three quarter-time at the Sydney Showground, and the home side is running away with it. It\u2019s GWS 10.7 (67)-4.7 (31) Gold Coast. Ben King has scored his first goal, which must be exciting. AFL: it\u2019s three quarter-time at the MCG and the visitors have made a powerful comeback and will enter the final quarter with a slender lead. It\u2019s Collingwood 8.6 (54)-8.10 (58) Fremantle. Football: more fine Champions League final writing, this time from Liverpool and Spurs fans, rather than journalists. It\u2019s why they love the team they love. AFL: it\u2019s half-time in Sydney, and the homeboys are dominating. It\u2019s GWS 6.5 (41)-3.4 (22) Gold Coast. Ben King has scored his first goal, which must be exciting. The kick that ended Jack Bowes\u2019 game. AFL: it\u2019s half-time in Melbourne and the home side have powered ahead. It\u2019s Collingwood 6.5 (41)-4.4 (28) Fremantle. Some hard tackles have been going in. Football: if you\u2019re getting up at the crack of dawn to watch the European Cup final (of course you are), you will want to read this piece about how Mauricio Pochettino has weaved his special kind of magic at Tottenham Hotspur. \u201cWhen you see the arrow, you think: \u2018It\u2019s impossible. How am I going to break the arrow against my throat?\u2019\u201d the enigmatic Argentine says. AFL: it\u2019s quarter-time in the Sydney Showground, and it\u2019s GWS 4.2 (26)-3.3 (21) Gold Coast. Ben King has scored his first goal, which must be exciting. AFL: it\u2019s quarter-time at the MCG and scores are level. It\u2019s Collingwood 3.3 (21)-3.3 (21) Fremantle. The game so far has included a somewhat controversial goal. Rugby union: if you have not already read Martin Pengelly\u2019s story on rugby\u2019s advance in the US, now is the time to do so. Sport with a serious social purpose gets the thumbs up from me. \u201cRugby was a good choice because it lets them let out some anger and aggression.\u201d Football: J\u00fcrgen Klopp has stated the bleeding obvious by saying Liverpool\u2019s success or otherwise will be judged by silverware. It\u2019s Liverpool, J\u00fcrgen, of course you\u2019re going to be judged by what you win. Football: the Socceroos are continuing their preparations for their friendly international against Korea Republic in Busan next Friday, where it was confirmed the match would be played in front of a capacity crowd of more than 54,000. Bailey Wright, who is looking to earn his first Socceroos cap since early last year says he\u2019s relishing the opportunity to be one of the more experienced players in the squad. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a young squad here, my leadership qualities have grown over the years, I\u2019ve become club captain at Bristol City. I try and grow who I am but I don\u2019t try and change who I am, those things happen naturally, I like to commentate whilst involved in sessions and I think that\u2019s how I can get the best out of myself and my team-mates,\u201d he said. Also re-joining the Socceroos for this camp is Western Sydney Wanderers forward Mitchell Duke, who last played for the national team in 2013. The 28 year old recently returned to Australia after four seasons in Japan.\u201cI experienced promotion and relegation in Japan, which is a great learning curve, it strengthens you mentally, it has helped me grow as a player. I think I\u2019ve grown, I was a bit raw when I went there,\u201d he said. Australia\u2019s match against Korea Republic will kick-off at 8pm local time (9pm AEST) on Friday 7 June and will be broadcast live in Australia on Fox and Network 10 (10 Bold). Tennis: Kevin has, of course, also written about the women\u2019s game, in particular, Johanna Konta. Tennis: Kevin Mitchell, our man at Roland Garros, has the latest from the French Open. Football: Richard Parkin, who is our man in Eindhoven, has written that the Matildas\u2019 focus remains firmly on preparations for the World Cup in France. Cricket: before we get into the afternoon\u2019s games, have a read of Sam Perry\u2019s fine article on how Australian cricket is moving into a new era. Good afternoon, or morning, depending on where you are looking at this blog from. I will be bringing you updates from AFL, netball, rugby and more for the next few hours.",

      "body": "<p>Scale it up and it\u2019s revolution; scale it down and it\u2019s individual non-cooperation that may be seen as nothing more than obstinacy or malingering or not seen at all. What we call protest identifies one aspect of popular power and resistance, a force so woven into history and everyday life that you miss a lot of its impact if you focus only on groups of people taking stands in public places. But people taking such stands have changed the world over and over, toppled regimes, won rights, terrified tyrants, stopped pipelines and deforestation and dams. They go far further back than the Peterloo protests and massacre 200 years ago, to the great revolutions of France and then of Haiti against France and back before that to peasant uprisings and indigenous resistance in Africa and the Americas to colonisation and enslavement and to countless acts of resistance on all scales that were never recorded.</p> <p>They will go far forward from this moment. And at this moment, with organisations addressing the climate crisis, reinvigorated feminism in many parts of the world, antiracist and human rights campaigns focused on specific groups and issues, protest is a force running through everything \u2013 and running against a lot of things, since this is also an age of authoritarianism and a consolidation of wealth among a global superelite.</p> <p>Right now, for example, Florida\u2019s Coalition of Immokalee Workers is forming another alliance with students to pursue rights for farmworkers by targeting nationwide US burger chain Wendy\u2019s. They can stand as one of the great examples of the power of the supposedly powerless, which could be more fruitfully thought of as exercisers of other kinds of power than institutional, military, or financial power, the kind less seldom recognised, cultivated, studied or valued. This alliance of labour organisers and immigrant farm workers from the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico began co-ordinating human rights and workers\u2019 rights campaigns almost two decades ago, from a base in the tomato-growing region around the town of Immokalee in Florida. It would be easy to call immigrant farm workers powerless, and indeed modern-day slavery was one of the issues they addressed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7e71fb9e066861199571c3959725a7f25ddb6c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7e71fb9e066861199571c3959725a7f25ddb6c0/644_19_2621_1573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Phillips marches against the Dakota Access oil pipeline near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Phillips marches against the Dakota Access oil pipeline near Cannon Ball, North Dakota, US.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terray Sylvester/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But they understood the nature of power: to get a living wage, they needed to get a few cents more per box of tomatoes, and pressuring the farmers wasn\u2019t going to work, so they went after the buyers, the big supermarkets and fast-food chains, targeting one at a time, building coalitions, media campaigns, holding marches and other public events. And winning. They conquered Taco Bell in 2005. Then McDonald\u2019s. Then Burger King, Whole Foods Market, and Subway by 2008, and they kept going. They fought modern-day slavery, sent the enslaving farmers to jail and established workplace standards that recently expanded to address the epidemic of sexual harassment and abuse in the fields. \u201c<em>Todos somos l\u00edderes\u201d</em> (We are all leaders) is one of their sayings, insisting that power is everywhere and everyone can exercise it as they do.</p> <p>The people who first and last resist slavery, then and now, are the enslaved, and the history of 18th-century England and Scotland includes lawsuits and other tactics to free individual slaves. Olaudah Equiano, who was kidnapped from his Igbo village in what is now south-eastern Nigeria and sold into slavery, purchased his own freedom and became an anti-slavery activist in England. In 1789 he published a widely read autobiography that deepened and broadened knowledge of the brutalities of slavery. Part of the danger of imagining change as a process forced by violence and brute power is that it overlooks the great power of nonviolent uprisings and those other moments when individuals become a civil society on its feet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The most important battle is often in the collective imagination, won in part by books, ideas, songs, speeches</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It also ignores how the most important battle is often in the collective imagination, and it is won in part by books, ideas, songs, speeches, even new words and frameworks for old evils. The second US president, John Adams, said the American Revolution took place \u201cin the minds and hearts of the people\u201d before hostilities commenced. What makes something long tolerated intolerable, what makes people not directly affected care, what sways public opinion, what tips the balance, what makes politicians recognise that the dangers of not acting have come to outweigh those of acting? Another thing to remember about the great public moments, whether it\u2019s the uprisings against the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/wto\" title=\"\">World Trade Organization</a> in Seattle and elsewhere in 1999, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/15/iraq-war-mass-protest\" title=\"\">global protest</a> against the Iraq war in 2003, or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/live/2017/jan/21/womens-march-on-washington-and-other-anti-trump-protests-around-the-world-live-coverage\" title=\"\">2017 women\u2019s marches</a> in hundreds of places across the globe, is that they are not the planting but the harvest of a change in public imagination.</p> <p>People cared; something made them care; people were ready to act; something made them ready; people joined; someone or many someones issued the call and orchestrated the action. One metaphor that has worked for me is: the mushrooms that spring up after rain are only the fruiting body of a far larger underground fungus we do not see; the rain causes the mushrooms to rise out of the earth, but the fungus was alive and well (and invisible) beforehand; the rain can be an event. Think of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries that caused <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/jan/29/trump-refugee-ban-airport-protests\" title=\"\">Americans to go to airports</a> all over the country in January 2017, or how the lack of adequate action on the climate crisis prompted Extinction Rebellion to take over key sites in London in April. And then these public actions often have consequences of their own; that the UK parliament declared a climate emergency at the beginning of last month is undoubtedly in part a response to this action, but of course the official powers \u2013 let\u2019s call them the aboveground powers \u2013 do not like to acknowledge the underground powers, and so they generally dismiss, ignore, or demonise them. But we do not have to. In these great collective moments people showed up because they cared; when they showed up they often found a new sense of solidarity and power, which generated yet more possibilities.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"823a39df50c1cb1baf483dd34f57156f3f5b10c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/823a39df50c1cb1baf483dd34f57156f3f5b10c1/0_160_4724_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Extinction Rebellion Climate protest at Tate modern last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Extinction Rebellion Climate protest at Tate Modern in 2018.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claire Doherty/In Pictures via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The seeds of a great public anti-slavery campaign in the western world were planted on 22 May 1787. That day, a group of 12 Quaker men gathered in a printing shop in London to launch a campaign that, as Adam Hochschild relates in his magnificent book <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview2\" title=\"\">Bury the Chains</a></em>, would take almost 50 years to succeed, and only one of them would survive to see the end of, a campaign to end slavery throughout the British empire. Among the tactics the movement deployed, as the years passed, were a sugar boycott, the now famous engraving of how Africans were packed into the hulls of slave ships, letter writing and lobbying parliament, engaging the public in the campaign. These are now common tactics for social change. In 1807, buying and selling slaves became illegal across the empire; owning slaves became illegal by a process beginning in 1833. It was a process more considerate of slave owners than slaves, compensating the former rather than the latter, but it freed slaves and outlawed slavery.</p> <p>Liberation is contagious, as an idea and as a process. One of the most extraordinary chains of events of the 19th century was the response of American women active in the US abolitionist movement, who were excluded from even being seated, let alone speaking, at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, in June 1840. It prompted women already involved in trying to end slavery to begin looking at their own lack of rights, freedoms and equalities. The result was the suffrage movement, which made the antislavery movement look speedy; it took 80 years to ratify the 19th amendment to the US constitution, declaring no one would be denied the right to vote \u201con account of sex\u201d (and we\u2019re still fighting in the US for the right to vote regardless of race). It prompted suffrage movements in other countries around the world. I don\u2019t know exactly how the black <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\" title=\"\">civil </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/civil-rights-movement\" title=\"\">rights</a> movement triggered the other racial justice movements around the US for Latinx, Asian American and Native American rights, but I know that 50 years ago the Native American <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/04/san-francisco-then-and-now-super-bowl-50\" title=\"\">occupation of Alcatraz Island</a> had a huge impact. As with the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline three years ago, the campaign went far beyond its boundaries and official goals.</p> <p>I described these great public actions as harvests of the seeds planted before them; the ripe crop generates more seeds. The great gathering of resistance at Standing Rock inspired Alexandria <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/standing-rock-ocasio-cortez-protest-climate-activism\" title=\"\">Ocasio-Cortez</a> to run for office, and her success and subsequent actions have been extraordinary in their dedication to tackling the climate crisis, notably with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/dec/29/green-new-deal-plans-proposal-ocasio-cortez-sunrise-movement\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a>. Standing Rock, I have been told, inculcated pride and hope and a sense of power, as well as bringing about new alliances and healing old conflicts, for many Native American participants.

      "bodyText": "Scale it up and it\u2019s revolution; scale it down and it\u2019s individual non-cooperation that may be seen as nothing more than obstinacy or malingering or not seen at all. What we call protest identifies one aspect of popular power and resistance, a force so woven into history and everyday life that you miss a lot of its impact if you focus only on groups of people taking stands in public places. But people taking such stands have changed the world over and over, toppled regimes, won rights, terrified tyrants, stopped pipelines and deforestation and dams. They go far further back than the Peterloo protests and massacre 200 years ago, to the great revolutions of France and then of Haiti against France and back before that to peasant uprisings and indigenous resistance in Africa and the Americas to colonisation and enslavement and to countless acts of resistance on all scales that were never recorded. They will go far forward from this moment. And at this moment, with organisations addressing the climate crisis, reinvigorated feminism in many parts of the world, antiracist and human rights campaigns focused on specific groups and issues, protest is a force running through everything \u2013 and running against a lot of things, since this is also an age of authoritarianism and a consolidation of wealth among a global superelite. Right now, for example, Florida\u2019s Coalition of Immokalee Workers is forming another alliance with students to pursue rights for farmworkers by targeting nationwide US burger chain Wendy\u2019s. They can stand as one of the great examples of the power of the supposedly powerless, which could be more fruitfully thought of as exercisers of other kinds of power than institutional, military, or financial power, the kind less seldom recognised, cultivated, studied or valued. This alliance of labour organisers and immigrant farm workers from the Caribbean, Central America and Mexico began co-ordinating human rights and workers\u2019 rights campaigns almost two decades ago, from a base in the tomato-growing region around the town of Immokalee in Florida. It would be easy to call immigrant farm workers powerless, and indeed modern-day slavery was one of the issues they addressed. But they understood the nature of power: to get a living wage, they needed to get a few cents more per box of tomatoes, and pressuring the farmers wasn\u2019t going to work, so they went after the buyers, the big supermarkets and fast-food chains, targeting one at a time, building coalitions, media campaigns, holding marches and other public events. And winning. They conquered Taco Bell in 2005. Then McDonald\u2019s. Then Burger King, Whole Foods Market, and Subway by 2008, and they kept going. They fought modern-day slavery, sent the enslaving farmers to jail and established workplace standards that recently expanded to address the epidemic of sexual harassment and abuse in the fields. \u201cTodos somos l\u00edderes\u201d (We are all leaders) is one of their sayings, insisting that power is everywhere and everyone can exercise it as they do. The people who first and last resist slavery, then and now, are the enslaved, and the history of 18th-century England and Scotland includes lawsuits and other tactics to free individual slaves. Olaudah Equiano, who was kidnapped from his Igbo village in what is now south-eastern Nigeria and sold into slavery, purchased his own freedom and became an anti-slavery activist in England. In 1789 he published a widely read autobiography that deepened and broadened knowledge of the brutalities of slavery. Part of the danger of imagining change as a process forced by violence and brute power is that it overlooks the great power of nonviolent uprisings and those other moments when individuals become a civil society on its feet. It also ignores how the most important battle is often in the collective imagination, and it is won in part by books, ideas, songs, speeches, even new words and frameworks for old evils. The second US president, John Adams, said the American Revolution took place \u201cin the minds and hearts of the people\u201d before hostilities commenced. What makes something long tolerated intolerable, what makes people not directly affected care, what sways public opinion, what tips the balance, what makes politicians recognise that the dangers of not acting have come to outweigh those of acting? Another thing to remember about the great public moments, whether it\u2019s the uprisings against the World Trade Organization in Seattle and elsewhere in 1999, or the global protest against the Iraq war in 2003, or the 2017 women\u2019s marches in hundreds of places across the globe, is that they are not the planting but the harvest of a change in public imagination. People cared; something made them care; people were ready to act; something made them ready; people joined; someone or many someones issued the call and orchestrated the action. One metaphor that has worked for me is: the mushrooms that spring up after rain are only the fruiting body of a far larger underground fungus we do not see; the rain causes the mushrooms to rise out of the earth, but the fungus was alive and well (and invisible) beforehand; the rain can be an event. Think of Donald Trump\u2019s immigration ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries that caused Americans to go to airports all over the country in January 2017, or how the lack of adequate action on the climate crisis prompted Extinction Rebellion to take over key sites in London in April. And then these public actions often have consequences of their own; that the UK parliament declared a climate emergency at the beginning of last month is undoubtedly in part a response to this action, but of course the official powers \u2013 let\u2019s call them the aboveground powers \u2013 do not like to acknowledge the underground powers, and so they generally dismiss, ignore, or demonise them. But we do not have to. In these great collective moments people showed up because they cared; when they showed up they often found a new sense of solidarity and power, which generated yet more possibilities. The seeds of a great public anti-slavery campaign in the western world were planted on 22 May 1787. That day, a group of 12 Quaker men gathered in a printing shop in London to launch a campaign that, as Adam Hochschild relates in his magnificent book Bury the Chains, would take almost 50 years to succeed, and only one of them would survive to see the end of, a campaign to end slavery throughout the British empire. Among the tactics the movement deployed, as the years passed, were a sugar boycott, the now famous engraving of how Africans were packed into the hulls of slave ships, letter writing and lobbying parliament, engaging the public in the campaign. These are now common tactics for social change. In 1807, buying and selling slaves became illegal across the empire; owning slaves became illegal by a process beginning in 1833. It was a process more considerate of slave owners than slaves, compensating the former rather than the latter, but it freed slaves and outlawed slavery. Liberation is contagious, as an idea and as a process. One of the most extraordinary chains of events of the 19th century was the response of American women active in the US abolitionist movement, who were excluded from even being seated, let alone speaking, at the World Anti-Slavery Convention in London, in June 1840. It prompted women already involved in trying to end slavery to begin looking at their own lack of rights, freedoms and equalities. The result was the suffrage movement, which made the antislavery movement look speedy; it took 80 years to ratify the 19th amendment to the US constitution, declaring no one would be denied the right to vote \u201con account of sex\u201d (and we\u2019re still fighting in the US for the right to vote regardless of race). It prompted suffrage movements in other countries around the world. I don\u2019t know exactly how the black civil rights movement triggered the other racial justice movements around the US for Latinx, Asian American and Native American rights, but I know that 50 years ago the Native American occupation of Alcatraz Island had a huge impact. As with the Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline three years ago, the campaign went far beyond its boundaries and official goals. I described these great public actions as harvests of the seeds planted before them; the ripe crop generates more seeds. The great gathering of resistance at Standing Rock inspired Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for office, and her success and subsequent actions have been extraordinary in their dedication to tackling the climate crisis, notably with the Green New Deal. Standing Rock, I have been told, inculcated pride and hope and a sense of power, as well as bringing about new alliances and healing old conflicts, for many Native American participants. It also raised awareness of indigenous rights and land issues for a lot of non-native people. Like the long campaign against the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Alberta, Canada, to Nebraska in the midwest, it served as an education for people around the continent and beyond about the role of pipelines in making fossil fuel extraction profitable, the dangers and impacts and politics. There is nothing more direct than an encampment of several hundred people or a march of tens of thousands, but that does not mean the consequences will be direct, or that only the direct and measurable ones matter. Every action shifts the world\u2019s balance, sometimes those shifts will never be noted or will have their impact long after or far away. At Peterloo, unarmed people were massacred by armed cavalry; it\u2019s easy to portray this as a defeat, but it is said to have shifted the balance in such a way that the issue of universal male suffrage became urgent and led 13 years later to the Reform Act of 1832.

In the past couple of years, technological advancements have enabled long-dead artists including Maria Callas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/10/the-bizarre-world-of-frank-zappa-review-edinburgh-playhouse\">Frank Zappa</a> and Roy Orbison to float on to stages worldwide, often accompanied by a live band. In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/19/amy-winehouse-stars-turned-into-hologram-virtual-reality\">a postponed Amy Winehouse tour</a>, last month brought the biggest news in the pop hologram\u2019s young history, with an announcement that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/21/whitney-houston-hologram-tour-album-broadway-show-planned\">Whitney Houston</a> would return to the stage thanks to VFX company Base Hologram \u2014 the first in a raft of projects which will also include an album of unreleased music (culled from 1985\u2019s Whitney Houston<em> </em>album sessions) and a Broadway show. \u201cShe adored her audiences,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/21/whitney-houston-hologram-tour-album-broadway-show-planned\">said Pat Houston</a>, Whitney\u2019s sister-in-law and the president of the late singer\u2019s estate. \u201cThat\u2019s why we know she would have loved this holographic theatrical concept.\u201d</p> <p>Would Houston really have loved it, or is this simply a cold-blooded manoeuvre to squeeze every drop of cash from her legacy? The pop star\u2019s cousin <a href=\"https://www.etonline.com/dionne-warwick-thinks-plans-for-a-whitney-houston-hologram-tour-are-stupid-exclusive-125854\">Dionne Warwick has already blasted the hologram tour</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d</p> <p>Marty Tudor, CEO of production at Base Hologram, explains that his team has been working on the \u201celaborate\u201d hologram creation process for a few months now. \u201cWe do everything very closely in conjunction with the family, with the estate,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, we give them approvals over most of what we do, because we do not want to violate somebody\u2019s legacy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"000a7c3f24b61a11c7dd8d4ef09a6448ce52a80c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/000a7c3f24b61a11c7dd8d4ef09a6448ce52a80c/90_0_2082_1249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We know she would have loved it\u2019 \u2026 a PR image of the Whitney Houston hologram\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We know she would have loved it\u2019 \u2026 a PR image of the Whitney Houston hologram</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Voice</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The actual process of creating Digi-Whitney is secret, but it essentially involves filming an actor performing every beat of the show, and then mapping her body with Houston\u2019s image. (Think of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2015/dec/06/andy-serkis-film-hobbit-king-kong-fungus\">Andy Serkis against a green screen</a> to create Gollum, and you\u2019re not far off.) Audiences won\u2019t see the real Houston\u2019s movements, but an actor\u2019s studied interpretation of what she was like. Tudor was defensive when confronted with the idea that a hologram of a dead person is, for some, inherently ghoulish. He pointed to the case of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/jan/16/rogue-one-vfx-jon-knoll-peter-cushing-ethics-of-digital-resurrections\">Peter Cushing</a>, who was able to appear in 2016\u2019s Star Wars: Rogue One<em> </em>thanks to CGI trickery, even though he died two decades prior: \u201cWhen you went to see that, and Peter Cushing was all the way through that movie, I guarantee you nobody was thinking about the fact that he\u2019s dead.\u201d Well, apart from the widespread outcry over Cushing\u2019s reanimation, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/dec/21/peter-cushing-rogue-one-resurrection-cgi\">described as \u201ca digital indignity\u201d</a> in this newspaper.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Compliance with the law is only a small part of ethics. Long-dead people who coudn't imagine this technology would likely never have consented to this use of their image</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Hollywood is catching up to this. Before his death in 2014, <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/robin-williams-restricted-exploitation-his-785292\">Robin Williams made the unprecedented move</a> to create a legal document that safeguarded the use of his image for 25 years after he died. That decision prevents anyone from inserting a CGI Williams into a movie, or, say, putting his hologram in a new Patch Adams Broadway spectacular. Crucially, Williams went as far as to ban even <em>authori</em><em>sed</em> uses of his image, meaning that his wishes will stay watertight even if his estate tries to push something through. A Prince hologram was planned to appear as part of Justin Timberlake\u2019s 2018 Super Bowl performance, but was nixed in the wake of <a href=\"https://pitchfork.com/news/longtime-prince-collaborator-sheila-e-disapproves-of-prince-hologram/\">an old interview from 1998</a> resurfacing in which The Purple One called holograms \u201cdemonic.\u201d But few public figures could have Prince\u2019s foresight, or Williams\u2019s meticulousness. (Timberlake ended up projecting Prince on what looked like a giant bed sheet.)</p> <p>\u201cThis is a case where the difference between law and morality is important,\u201d says Robin James, a professor of philosophy, gender studies and music at the University of North Carolina. \u201cContracts are usually written so that images or recordings can be used in perpetuity, for whatever reason the owner wants. However, compliance with the law is only a small part of ethics. Long-dead people who couldn\u2019t imagine that this sort of tech would ever exist would likely have never consented to this specific use of their work and image.\u201d</p> <p>In this way, we\u2019re still in what the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori called the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/13/robots-human-uncanny-valley\">uncanny valley</a>\u201d. Back in 1970, Mori coined the term to describe our repulsion to things that seem <em>almost</em> human, but not quite right. Last year, Base Hologram brought the adored opera singer Maria Callas back to life for string of performances backed by symphony orchestras. Writing of Callas 2.0\u2019s performance in Blacksburg, Virginia, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/deceptivecadence/2018/11/06/664653353/raising-the-dead-and-a-few-questions-with-maria-callas-hologram?t=1558639974449&amp;t=1558951157904\">NPR journalist Tom Huizenga described</a> the production\u2019s \u201cabsurdities and technical deficiencies\u201d \u2014 Callas\u2019s voice was flattened to a blanketing blare, and her hologram bizarrely accepted a proffered \u201creal\u201d rose on stage \u2014 as well the unsettling, tear-jerking power of seeing a long-dead diva perform \u201clive\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d4b1ce35195f8df67a68599f52307b9f911944d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d4b1ce35195f8df67a68599f52307b9f911944d2/0_468_4356_2172/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The hologram Maria Callas in concert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hologram Maria Callas in concert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Mendez/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even so, hologram tours do have one indisputable thing going for them: they\u2019re cheap to attend. Pop concerts are <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/why-your-favorite-concerts-are-bigger-and-more-expensive-than-ever-699722/\">pricier than ever</a>, with tickets going for well into the triple digits. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll pay just \u00a360 for the best seat in the house at Base Hologram\u2019s upcoming Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison\u2019s hologram tour, which premieres in the UK this September. For some fans, the novelty factor and affordability will be a worthwhile tradeoff for an imperfect show created without the explicit consent of its star.</p> <p>For the music journalist and author Simon Reynolds, the wave of hologram tours is an affront to the core notion of live performance. \u201cTo what extent are these performances in any real sense?\u201d he asks. \u201cA performance \u2013 whether showbiz entertainment or performance art \u2013 is by definition live, involving the unmediated presence of living performers, whereas the hologram tours are \u2018un-live\u2019 and involve non-presence.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It's unfair competition: established stars continuing their market domination after death and stifling the opportunities for new artists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cOn an ethical and economic level, I would liken it to a form of \u2018ghost slavery\u2019,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat applies certainly when done without the consent of the star, [but rather] by the artist\u2019s estate in collusion with the record company or tour promoter. It\u2019s a form of unfair competition: established stars continuing their market domination after death and stifling the opportunities for new artists.\u201d</p> <p>Prof James agrees. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s always going to be fans <em>remembering</em> artists,\u201d she says. \u201cImagine if there was a Beatles hologram show. With their ongoing popularity, having seen the Beatles in concert won\u2019t be just a boomer thing any more. It could have a sort of flattening or homogenising effect across eras and generations.\u201d</p> <p>Today\u2019s explosion of hologram tours could sow the seeds for a future in which androids no longer dream of electric sheep, but are manipulated for chart domination. Reynolds imagines the unscrupulous use of technology to capture and replicate performers\u2019 vocal timbre and bodily mannerisms. \u201cYou would get a sort of digi-simulacrum of the artist singing new songs, guesting as vocalist or rapper on other people\u2019s records, or appearing in videos or movies,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the recording studio, you\u2019d just need the software which would generate the voice.\u201d</p> <p>Part of live music\u2019s magic thrill is breathing the same air as your pop idol, hearing that night\u2019s vocal tics and jaw-dropping high notes up close, as well as their obligatory groan-worthy stage banter. For many fans, that will remain preferable to a seamless, stitched together performance from a dead artist who never agreed to be reanimated in the first place. Might it be seen as unconscionable to resurrect an artist without their explicit approval, a depressing symptom of greedy music industry vampirism where not even the dead are able to rest in peace?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dfa1df4e032fe49ec0bf90ed0c0e157098d60581\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfa1df4e032fe49ec0bf90ed0c0e157098d60581/0_0_6000_3857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles on stage at Coachella \u2026 captured in detail for posterity.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles on stage at Coachella \u2026 captured in detail for posterity.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for Coachella</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But hologram technology for current \u2014 and <em>consenting</em> \u2014 artists offers more enticing possibilities. Executive producer John Canning of Digital Domain, the company that enabled Tupac\u2019s Coachella cameo, predicts that capture and display technology will enable us to watch holographic performances from awards shows like the Grammys in our living rooms. \u201cYou can see the glimmers of what is possible when you put on a high-end VR headset,\u201d he says. \u201cThat experience is just going to get better.\u201d</p> <p>Similar technology could also give fabulous depth to pop history. Last year, Beyonc\u00e9 meticulously recorded her epochal Coachella headline slot for Netflix, creating a electrifying visual and audio archive of a performance which centred black culture and marked her artistic peak. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that she could have created 3D scans of her every ad-libbed gesture and dutty-wine for a global hologram tour of the concert. Would The Beychella Experience have the same magic as the original live performance? No way. Would it redefine the possibilities of concert films? Yep. Would it sell every ticket every time? Absolutely.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70264888\">Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qIlCo9yqpY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-qIlCo9yqpY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qIlCo9yqpY\">Watch a trailer for Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too</a></figcaption> </figure>",

The pop star\u2019s cousin Dionne Warwick has already blasted the hologram tour. \u201cIt\u2019s surprising to me,\u201d she said. \u201cI think it\u2019s stupid.\u201d Marty Tudor, CEO of production at Base Hologram, explains that his team has been working on the \u201celaborate\u201d hologram creation process for a few months now. \u201cWe do everything very closely in conjunction with the family, with the estate,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly, we give them approvals over most of what we do, because we do not want to violate somebody\u2019s legacy.\u201d The actual process of creating Digi-Whitney is secret, but it essentially involves filming an actor performing every beat of the show, and then mapping her body with Houston\u2019s image. (Think of Andy Serkis against a green screen to create Gollum, and you\u2019re not far off.) Audiences won\u2019t see the real Houston\u2019s movements, but an actor\u2019s studied interpretation of what she was like. Tudor was defensive when confronted with the idea that a hologram of a dead person is, for some, inherently ghoulish. He pointed to the case of Peter Cushing, who was able to appear in 2016\u2019s Star Wars: Rogue One thanks to CGI trickery, even though he died two decades prior: \u201cWhen you went to see that, and Peter Cushing was all the way through that movie, I guarantee you nobody was thinking about the fact that he\u2019s dead.\u201d Well, apart from the widespread outcry over Cushing\u2019s reanimation, which was described as \u201ca digital indignity\u201d in this newspaper. Hollywood is catching up to this. Before his death in 2014, Robin Williams made the unprecedented move to create a legal document that safeguarded the use of his image for 25 years after he died. That decision prevents anyone from inserting a CGI Williams into a movie, or, say, putting his hologram in a new Patch Adams Broadway spectacular. Crucially, Williams went as far as to ban even authorised uses of his image, meaning that his wishes will stay watertight even if his estate tries to push something through. A Prince hologram was planned to appear as part of Justin Timberlake\u2019s 2018 Super Bowl performance, but was nixed in the wake of an old interview from 1998 resurfacing in which The Purple One called holograms \u201cdemonic.\u201d But few public figures could have Prince\u2019s foresight, or Williams\u2019s meticulousness. (Timberlake ended up projecting Prince on what looked like a giant bed sheet.) \u201cThis is a case where the difference between law and morality is important,\u201d says Robin James, a professor of philosophy, gender studies and music at the University of North Carolina. \u201cContracts are usually written so that images or recordings can be used in perpetuity, for whatever reason the owner wants. However, compliance with the law is only a small part of ethics. Long-dead people who couldn\u2019t imagine that this sort of tech would ever exist would likely have never consented to this specific use of their work and image.\u201d In this way, we\u2019re still in what the Japanese roboticist Masahiro Mori called the \u201cuncanny valley\u201d. Back in 1970, Mori coined the term to describe our repulsion to things that seem almost human, but not quite right. Last year, Base Hologram brought the adored opera singer Maria Callas back to life for string of performances backed by symphony orchestras. Writing of Callas 2.0\u2019s performance in Blacksburg, Virginia, NPR journalist Tom Huizenga described the production\u2019s \u201cabsurdities and technical deficiencies\u201d \u2014 Callas\u2019s voice was flattened to a blanketing blare, and her hologram bizarrely accepted a proffered \u201creal\u201d rose on stage \u2014 as well the unsettling, tear-jerking power of seeing a long-dead diva perform \u201clive\u201d. Even so, hologram tours do have one indisputable thing going for them: they\u2019re cheap to attend. Pop concerts are pricier than ever, with tickets going for well into the triple digits. Meanwhile, you\u2019ll pay just \u00a360 for the best seat in the house at Base Hologram\u2019s upcoming Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison\u2019s hologram tour, which premieres in the UK this September. For some fans, the novelty factor and affordability will be a worthwhile tradeoff for an imperfect show created without the explicit consent of its star. For the music journalist and author Simon Reynolds, the wave of hologram tours is an affront to the core notion of live performance. \u201cTo what extent are these performances in any real sense?\u201d he asks. \u201cA performance \u2013 whether showbiz entertainment or performance art \u2013 is by definition live, involving the unmediated presence of living performers, whereas the hologram tours are \u2018un-live\u2019 and involve non-presence. \u201cOn an ethical and economic level, I would liken it to a form of \u2018ghost slavery\u2019,\u201d he continues. \u201cThat applies certainly when done without the consent of the star, [but rather] by the artist\u2019s estate in collusion with the record company or tour promoter. It\u2019s a form of unfair competition: established stars continuing their market domination after death and stifling the opportunities for new artists.\u201d Prof James agrees. \u201cI\u2019m not sure it\u2019s always going to be fans remembering artists,\u201d she says. \u201cImagine if there was a Beatles hologram show. With their ongoing popularity, having seen the Beatles in concert won\u2019t be just a boomer thing any more. It could have a sort of flattening or homogenising effect across eras and generations.\u201d Today\u2019s explosion of hologram tours could sow the seeds for a future in which androids no longer dream of electric sheep, but are manipulated for chart domination. Reynolds imagines the unscrupulous use of technology to capture and replicate performers\u2019 vocal timbre and bodily mannerisms. \u201cYou would get a sort of digi-simulacrum of the artist singing new songs, guesting as vocalist or rapper on other people\u2019s records, or appearing in videos or movies,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the recording studio, you\u2019d just need the software which would generate the voice.\u201d Part of live music\u2019s magic thrill is breathing the same air as your pop idol, hearing that night\u2019s vocal tics and jaw-dropping high notes up close, as well as their obligatory groan-worthy stage banter. For many fans, that will remain preferable to a seamless, stitched together performance from a dead artist who never agreed to be reanimated in the first place. Might it be seen as unconscionable to resurrect an artist without their explicit approval, a depressing symptom of greedy music industry vampirism where not even the dead are able to rest in peace? But hologram technology for current \u2014 and consenting \u2014 artists offers more enticing possibilities. Executive producer John Canning of Digital Domain, the company that enabled Tupac\u2019s Coachella cameo, predicts that capture and display technology will enable us to watch holographic performances from awards shows like the Grammys in our living rooms. \u201cYou can see the glimmers of what is possible when you put on a high-end VR headset,\u201d he says. \u201cThat experience is just going to get better.\u201d Similar technology could also give fabulous depth to pop history. Last year, Beyonc\u00e9 meticulously recorded her epochal Coachella headline slot for Netflix, creating a electrifying visual and audio archive of a performance which centred black culture and marked her artistic peak. It\u2019s not hard to imagine that she could have created 3D scans of her every ad-libbed gesture and dutty-wine for a global hologram tour of the concert. Would The Beychella Experience have the same magic as the original live performance? No way. Would it redefine the possibilities of concert films? Yep. Would it sell every ticket every time? Absolutely. \u2022 Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June.",

      "body": "<p>When a Facebook friend told Lindsay about a \u201cgenius\u201d business opportunity in January 2015, the Manchester-based NHS laboratory assistant was already struggling for money. She had spent the last two years caring for her elderly father, and the stress meant she frequently missed shifts at work. Unwell with chronic fatigue syndrome and struggling to pay the household bills, Lindsay was instantly curious about her friend\u2019s offer.</p> <p>\u201cI hardly had any money coming in, and I was looking at everything, doing all the maths, and there just wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Lindsay says now from the red brick terraced house where she lives alone with her dog, Freya. The Facebook friend \u2013 who Lindsay has never met, but added on social media because they were both fans of the musician Jean-Michel Jarre \u2013 told her she could earn between \u00a350 and \u00a3500 a month if she signed up to a beauty sales business called Younique.</p> <p>\u201cI thought even if I make \u00a3100 a month, that\u2019s something\u2026 I don\u2019t have a big appetite, so my food only costs \u00a320 a week at most, if I\u2019m splurging out a bit,\u201d Lindsay says. Though she is just 36 years old, she walks with a cane and has a full head of grey hair. Her illness \u2013 which is characterised by extreme tiredness and joint pain \u2013 means she struggles to maintain her home. Paint is peeling from the walls, and an old mattress sits in the hallway.</p> <p>After receiving her monthly paycheck, Lindsay clicked on the link sent over by her Facebook friend and signed up to become a \u201cYounique presenter\u201d. Founded in September 2012 by an American brother-and-sister team, <a href=\"https://www.youniqueproducts.com/\" title=\"\">Younique</a> is a direct sales beauty company. Presenters sign up via the website and purchase products that they then sell on, earning a cut of the profits. Though there is no membership fee, members must regularly buy stock to retain presenter status. Lindsay paid \u00a369 for a starter kit, and then another \u00a3125 to become a \u201cyellow status\u201d presenter. Younique has eight different presenter statuses \u2013 whites, the people at the bottom, earn a 20% commission from their sales, while yellows, the next up in the scale,<strong> </strong>earn 25%.</p> <p>This commissions-based model is somewhat similar to Avon, the 133-year-old company that recruits \u201cAvon ladies\u201d to sell beauty products door-to-door. Yet unlike Avon ladies, Younique presenters buy and sell through social media \u2013 usually Facebook. \u201cWe are the first direct sales company to market and sell almost exclusively through the use of social media,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.youniqueproducts.com/business/about#.XOVySxNKjAx\" title=\"\">Younique\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.youniqueproducts.com/business/about#.XOVySxNKjAx\" title=\"\">website reads</a>, adding that its founders, Derek Maxfield and Melanie Huscroft, created the business to \u201cuplift\u201d their members. \u201cDerek and Melanie firmly believe that all women [the company targets women] should feel valued, smart, and empowered through opportunities for personal growth and financial reward!\u201d the website says. But in her three years as a Younique presenter, Lindsay lost roughly \u00a33,000.</p> <p>From 2015 to 2018, Lindsay spent \u00a340 to \u00a360 every month on stock to retain her yellow presenter status. Though she initially made some sales at the hospital where she worked, Lindsay was let go from the NHS in spring 2015 because of missed shifts caused by stress. She had been caring for her parents since 2011 \u2013 her mother passed away from cancer in 2012, while her father had Parkinson\u2019s and suffered from three strokes before his death in 2018. Though she stopped making Younique sales after losing her job, Lindsay wanted to retain her presenter status because she was planning to go to university and hoped to be able to sell to fellow students. Meanwhile, Younique kept encouraging her to buy stock.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They said your business is a rollercoaster, you just have to stay on it while it goes up and down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey would email saying, \u2018You\u2019re in danger of your account being suspended\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were worded in such a way to tell you, \u2018Oh, you only need to spend so much to keep yourself active.\u2019\u201d Lindsay says she didn\u2019t notice how much money she was spending on stock because it was a slow \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d of payments. \u201cBut then you look at it all together. I could have saved up, I could have done roof repairs on the house.\u201d In 2015, Lindsay attended a Younique training session in Glasgow where she was told not to \u201ccome with excuses\u201d about being unable to sell products. \u201cIt was made clear to me at that point, I had no get out clause for not making sales.\u201d Unsold makeup now sits in Lindsay\u2019s car, in her cupboards, and in a large plastic container in her living room.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Younique is not just a direct sales company \u2013 like Avon, it is also a multi-level marketing scheme (MLM). Multi-level marketing is a business strategy where revenue is generated from both product sales and the recruitment of new distributors. A Younique presenter can earn money by selling makeup, and also by persuading other women to join the company. Structurally, MLMs are akin to pyramid schemes \u2013 once someone signs up under you, you become their \u201cupline\u201d and take a portion of their earnings. If they sign up people beneath them, you also take a cut of those profits \u2013 a handful of people at the top get rich from thousands at the bottom.</p> <p>Over the last five years, MLMs have become increasingly popular in Britain. <a href=\"https://dsa.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Direct Selling Association (DSA)</a>, the only recognised UK trade body for the sector, estimates that roughly 400,000 people in the UK are involved in direct selling, although many do so on a casual basis. <a href=\"https://foreverliving.com/\" title=\"\">Forever Living</a> allows women to sell aloe vera-based drinks, gels and beauty products; <a href=\"https://www.arbonne.com/pws/homeoffice/tabs/home.aspx\" title=\"\">Arbonne</a> consultants sell skincare; <a href=\"https://www.herbalife.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Herbalife</a> representatives flog weight-loss products; <a href=\"https://www.juiceplus.com/gb/en\" title=\"\">Juice Plus</a> reps sell diet drinks; <a href=\"https://www.nuskin.com/en_GB/home.html\" title=\"\">Nu Skin</a> offers creams. Haircare MLM <a href=\"https://monatglobal.com/uk/\" title=\"\">Monat</a> is currently recruiting \u201cEU Founders\u201d.</p> <p>Social media means MLM presenters now sell to \u2013 and recruit from \u2013 the entire world. On Facebook, posts from uplines like Lindsay\u2019s friend promise \u201crocking\u201d sales, \u201cinstant\u201d pay, and the chance to run \u201cyour own business\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were encouraged to pick on stay-at-home mums, people who had just lost a job</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe main distinction between MLMs and pyramid schemes is MLMs actually have a product,\u201d says Daryl Koehn, a professor of business ethics at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cIn pyramid schemes, you\u2019re just selling the opportunity to make money.\u201d Yet Koehn argues that even when MLMs have products, they become pyramid schemes if there is a high cost of entry or if presenters build up inventory they can\u2019t sell.</p> <p>In 2011, Jon M Taylor, an employee at the US Consumer Awareness Institute, compiled a short ebook on MLMs for the Federal Trade Commission. <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_comments/trade-regulation-rule-disclosure-requirements-and-prohibitions-concerning-business-opportunities-ftc.r511993-00017%C2%A0/00017-57317.pdf\" title=\"\">\u201cAfter reading these chapters, the reader may wonder </a>if it is appropriate to refer to MLM, with its inherent flaws, as a \u2018business\u2019 at all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome who are familiar with MLM\u2019s abysmal statistics feel it is more appropriate to refer to virtually any MLM as a scam.\u201d</p> <p>In theory, anyone can sign up for an MLM. In practice, Koehn says the model appeals to \u201cpeople who have fewer opportunities\u201d. Like Lindsay, many people who join MLMs have disabilities, or poor health, and are unable to work full-time. Those who sign up are taught to target new and single mothers. \u201cWe were encouraged to pick on stay-at-home mums, people who had just lost a job,\u201d says Rachel (not her real name), a former Forever Living \u201cbusiness owner\u201d in her late 40s. She was recruited to Forever Living in 2016 as \u201ca newly single mum very willing to try anything to make a living for my kids\u201d, who were seven and nine at the time.</p> <p>Rachel\u2019s upline, a \u201ctrusted friend\u201d, told her to write a list of everyone she knew and \u201cprofile\u201d them, listing their aspirations and weaknesses. \u201cYou\u2019re encouraged to find out what it was they really want in life and then use that to promise that [Forever Living] would fulfil their want,\u201d she says. She was also given a recruiting script that included phrases such as \u201clifestyle-changing opportunity\u201d, \u201ccontrol your own destiny\u201d, and \u201cearn in excess of \u00a340k a year\u201d. She was told to avoid the word \u201cjob\u201d, partly because 9-5 jobs were presented as negative by the company, and partly, she believes, because Forever Living did not offer the consistent salary, paid holidays and sick pay that a traditional job would.</p> <p>It took six months for doubts to emerge, when she realised that the praise she initially received from her upline (\u201cYou\u2019re wonderful. You\u2019re perfect for this job,\u201d) was just a standard script used for all new recruits. Still, she stayed with Forever Living for nearly two more years.</p> <p>\u201cThey said your business is a rollercoaster, you just have to stay on it while it goes up and down,\u201d she explains, \u201cBut actually, it just went down, down, down.\u201d Rachel\u2019s uplines said her mindset was to blame when business was bad \u2013 linking her to seminars and success stories, and telling her that she had to attend online training sessions or she would fail. \u201cThere was a lot of emotional blackmail,\u201d she says. \u201cI would feel really guilty if I didn\u2019t attend fortnightly meetings.\u201d<strong> </strong>She says her upline encouraged her to \u201cstay away\u201d from people who criticised the company, including her own family. \u201cThey said if you don\u2019t work on your mindset, your business will fail,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b9dda728d3924be3e408f76356619e852f83292\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b9dda728d3924be3e408f76356619e852f83292/469_464_4750_5938/800.jpg\" alt=\"nail varnish pyramid\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was sucked in.

She was in multiple Facebook groups where women competed to sell products, shared advice and scripts, and formed friendships. She was told to be \u201ca product of the product\u201d by purchasing Forever Living products for personal use. \u201cI put all of my passion and all of my time \u2013 oh my goodness, the amount of time,\u201d she says now. \u201cI totally gave up other things. And I wasn\u2019t making any money.\u201d</p> <p>After quitting, she was devastated over the friendships she lost \u2013 many of her Forever Living colleagues blocked her on social media when she left the company, and the isolation meant she suffered a \u201cmild depression\u201d. She also still struggles with guilt from signing up a handful of women beneath her. \u201cI have since apologised to them all. Some of them are still trying to offload products that they\u2019ve got hanging around their house. I feel really awful. But I also think, I can\u2019t stay guilty forever, because I was sucked in. I believed everything they said.\u201d</p> <p>Rachel felt trapped: \u201cthey have you in this grip, this cultish grip,\u201d she says. \u201cCult\u201d is a word that every woman I speak to for this piece uses to refer to their time in an MLM.<strong> </strong>Many sell \u201cmindset training\u201d sessions to their presenters. \u201cNever let anyone tell you that you won\u2019t succeed,\u201d reads a slide from a presentation Rachel paid \u00a330 to stream. \u201cThe greatest comeback is to SHOW them your success.\u201d</p> <p>Fiona, a single mother of two from Merseyside, lost more than \u00a31,000 selling Arbonne cosmetics in 2016. She says her upline, a local woman who she met while working as a teaching assistant in a school, pressured her to \u201cprey\u201d on new mothers in soft play areas; after she convinced another single mother to join, she was told to pressure her into buying more products. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she says. Fiona\u2019s upline also told her to take out a credit card to buy stock \u2013 she is still paying off the debt.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s a lot of lies. We were told if you\u2019re going somewhere nice, post it with, \u2018Thanks to Younique, I\u2019m staying here\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During her 10 months at Arbonne, she was encouraged to set an alarm for 6.40am so she could listen to a motivational talk given live by an upline. \u201cIt\u2019s like brainwashing,\u201d she says, explaining that, like Rachel, she was told to become a \u201cproduct of the product\u201d by buying Arbonne for herself. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get drawn into it, particularly because at the time, as a single mum, I wasn\u2019t seeing an awful lot of other people.\u201d</p> <p>Members are encouraged to influence others by inflating their success on social media. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of lies,\u201d Lindsay says, \u201cWe were told if you\u2019re going somewhere nice, post it with, \u2018Thanks to Younique, I\u2019m staying here.\u2019\u201d Rachel says people who were struggling would post pictures of cars, spas, and prosecco to appear as though their business was thriving. Fiona says people were even encouraged to post pictures of their children if they were home sick from school, adding captions like, \u201cSo grateful I have a home-based business which allows me to carry on working while I care for my kids.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the social media scripts and many motivational sessions, Rachel says she never received any financial training or advice from Forever Living. It was only after she did her second year\u2019s tax return that she realised she hadn\u2019t made a profit and decided to quit. \u201cYou\u2019re not coached on how to manage your finances because if they did that, people would realise they weren\u2019t making any money.\u201d</p> <p>A UK spokesperson for Forever Living says via email that<strong> </strong>the company offers financial training through an independent accountancy company intermittently throughout the year. \u201cThe Forever network has been built over 40 years through collaboration, support and family values,\u201d they said.</p> <p>\u201cForever does not condone pressure of any description, misrepresentation of lifestyle, the business opportunity or promises of income levels, the company has clearly defined escalation procedures to deal with any such allegations.\u201d An <a href=\"https://s3.foreverliving.com/a1Jd000000EjE2EEAV%2F1557480646610Company+Policy+-+May+2019+-+S_FOR+SCREEN.pdf\" title=\"\">online company policy handbook</a> lists prohibited activities for Forever members, and refers to the DSA\u2019s dispute handling service. The spokesperson adds that Forever representatives are \u201cprohibited from placing orders until 75% of previous stock has been sold\u201d. This is done on what the company call a \u201cself-certifying\u201d basis, ie the seller tells them they have sold or used at least this much stock.</p> <p>When asked about Fiona\u2019s experiences, an Arbonne spokesperson based in Northampton says via email that their sales plan is \u201cnot a pyramid scheme; it is a standard, legal sales strategy\u201d. \u201cArbonne upholds the highest standards of integrity and we do not condone deceptive, unethical or illegal practices of any kind,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cOur Business Ethics Standards Team (BEST) conducts regular training sessions with Arbonne Independent Consultants, continuously monitors their business practices \u2026 and takes immediate action if questionable activities arise.\u201d They add that any unethical or improper behaviour can be reported at <a href=\"https://best.arbonne.com/\" title=\"\">BEST.Arbonne.com</a>. Fiona says she was not made aware of this reporting procedure.</p> <p>***</p> <p>If Lindsay was at the bottom of the Younique pyramid, then Lisa was at the top. The mother of three lives with her husband and children in a spacious semi-detached council house in a cul-de-sac outside of Halifax. A confident 36-year-old, she is immaculately put together, with sleek long black hair and stylish, minimal makeup. She first heard about Younique in 2014.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I have three children, I needed a job that would fit around them,\u201d she says from her living room \u2013 there are professional portraits of the children on the walls, a bookcase full of sports trophies, and, on the table, a felt pencil case her daughter recently made at school. Lisa joined Younique on the first day of its UK launch and went on to earn more than \u00a360,000 before she quit in 2018.</p> <p>\u201cIt was quite strange because I immediately had 38 people in my team,\u201d she says, explaining she had recruited 12 of these people, and the other 26 were people they in turn signed on. \u201cWe\u2019d all joined on the same day but suddenly I was in charge.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She had access to a group chat of 300 people who supported each other. 'That was appealing. I don't make friends easily'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While white and yellow Younique presenters only earn commission from their sales, after recruiting five women, members reach pink status. <a href=\"https://www.youniqueproducts.com/business/about#.XOV3JhNKjAy\" title=\"\">Pink status presenters earn 25% from their sales plus 3% commission</a> from sales made by women beneath them. By the time she left Younique, Lisa had reached the highest level, black status, and had more than 3,000 people beneath her. She calculates that 95% of her money was earned from commission on other women\u2019s sales.</p> <p>\u201cI made a lot of a money, a lot of money to me, and it meant I could stay at home with my kids,\u201d she says, adding that she also felt a boost in confidence. \u201cI went from not being able to pick up the phone to an unknown number to talking on stage in front of thousands of people.\u201d Lisa frequently spoke at Younique training sessions and conventions. </p> <p>Yet although Lisa feels Younique changed her life, her perspective shifted in 2018. Lisa says that during a Black Friday sales month in November, she slowly realised people felt pressured to buy stock they couldn\u2019t sell. \u201cThe leaders would always say nobody\u2019s forcing anybody to buy anything, but if you\u2019re recruiting women who\u2019ve lost a circle of friends because they\u2019ve had children, or they haven\u2019t got self-confidence, they\u2019re going to buy to be part of a group.\u201d</p> <p>Kirsty, a 27-year-old from London, tells me: \u201cI got suckered in to Younique due to the promise of \u2018sisterhood\u2019 being so strongly pushed on to me. I suffer with bipolar so I don\u2019t really make a lot of friends that easily,\u201d she says over the phone. A Facebook friend told her she would have access to a group chat of 300 people who supported each other. \u201cThat was appealing,\u201d she tells me. Yet Kirsty quickly found the group chat \u201ctoxic\u201d. \u201cOne woman said her husband was telling her to get a regular job because they were losing money, but the group was bizarre, telling her he was controlling and abusive,\u201d she alleges. \u201cIt also got really bitchy \u2013 one girl wasn\u2019t making enough sales and they made her feel bad in front of everyone.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, while women are often drawn to MLMs to make friends, they often end up with fewer than when they started. \u201cOne of the issues with MLMs is that you\u2019re told to target your friends and relatives,\u201d says business professor Koehn. \u201cPeople are trying to monetise social relationships.\u201d Rachel lost friendships because she \u201cpestered people every five minutes\u201d to sign up for Forever Living. She was told that if someone said \u201cno\u201d, she should write their name in a book called \u201cno for now\u201d and ask them again in a month. \u201cBecause I was encouraged to pester people every five minutes to sign up, friendships disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>But alliances made within the business are also fragile \u2013 often falling apart once women quit. \u201cSome people blocked me immediately,\u201d says Lisa of her decision to leave. \u201cWe spoke every day and all of sudden, we can\u2019t be friends.\u201d Rachel was particularly affected when she quit. \u201cThat was the thing that really got me in the end,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made friends and then when I did leave, I had nobody.\u201d</p> <p>***</p> <p>When so many women feel exploited by MLMs, why have these companies not been held to account? In America, clothing MLM LuLaRoe is currently being sued by Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson, who says that \u201cLuLaRoe tricked consumers into buying into its pyramid scheme with deceptive claims.\u201d<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/washington-attorney-general-sues-lularoe-clothing-accusing-company-of-pyramid-scheme/\" title=\"\">LulaRoe said in a statement </a>that the claims are completely without merit and that the company will fight vigorously against them.<strong> </strong>In July 2017, the Chinese government shut down hundreds of multi-level marketing companies, which it described as \u201cbusiness cults\u201d. Yet in the UK, no authorities are currently investigating them.</p> <p>Mumsnet decided in 2017 not to allow MLMs to advertise on the parenting site. \u201cWe thought about it long and hard because we know that home-based, flexible opportunities are very popular,\u201d says founder Justine Roberts, \u201cbut many Mumsnet users have posted about what they see as MLMs\u2019 invidious marketing techniques and the effects on vulnerable individuals, and we came to the conclusion that business models based primarily on recruiting have too much potential to be exploitative.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere online, hundreds of ordinary people are now campaigning against MLMs on social media. \u201cI think the authorities are doing an absolutely embarrassing job at regulating MLMs,\u201d says John Evans, a 39-year-old from Sussex who runs the 11,000-member Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1847755422133684/\" title=\"\">MLM Lies Exposed</a>. He was inspired to start the group after a friend tried to recruit him to an MLM. When Evans criticised the MLM model, his friend stopped speaking to him.</p> <p>\u201cMLMs are extremely clever at manipulating people. There\u2019s lots of psychology involved,\u201d Evans says. \u201cThe people who sign up lose money, but they\u2019re not stupid. They\u2019re victims.\u201d Evans says he has seen countless horror stories in the five years he has run his Facebook page. \u201cSome people are thousands of pounds down from these companies and they end up in the sunk cost fallacy where they just keep plugging away, keep desperately trying to dig themselves out of this financial hole,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Evans is particularly concerned when MLM reps make false medical claims about products on social media. A representative for Trading Standards explains MLMs become an issue for the body if a company breaches consumer protection regulations, by, for example, making misleading claims about products. In 2017, Trading Standards Cornwall shut down the business of former Miss England finalist, Charlotte Thomson, who had been selling weight-loss coffee Valentus, saying the product wasn\u2019t licensed for the UK market. Thomson said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d and stopped selling the product. To date, Trading Standards has not looked into any MLMs on a national level.</p> <p>Evans and others would like to see MLMs better regulated to ensure companies are open and honest when recruiting presenters. A spokesperson for Younique said that Lindsay, Lisa, and Kirsty\u2019s experiences \u201cdo not accurately reflect those of our hundreds of thousands of Younique presenters around the world, nor our organisation\u2019s values more fundamentally\u201d. The company says it does not permit presenters to make \u201cimproper claims\u201d about earnings or products, and has a team of compliance officers to ensure all presenters abide by company expectations.</p> <p>\u201cYounique presenters are not required to build product inventories at all,\u201d they go on. \u201cAdditionally, we aim to safeguard our presenters\u2019 financial security by enabling unused products purchased by them within the prior year to be returned for a full refund should they wish to terminate their relationship with the business.\u201d</p> <p>Younique, Arbonne, and Forever Living are all members of The Direct Selling Association (DSA). I put the claims in this article to them, including accounts of uplines making false claims about earnings and pressuring downlines into buying stock, and the DSA says they are investigating the allegations. Susannah Schofield, director general of the DSA, warns that people should \u201cbeware of individuals making outlandish claims about direct selling being a chance to \u2018get rich quick\u2019 \u2013 anything that looks or sounds too good to be true probably is\u201d. She adds that direct sales is \u201can effort-based\u201d business. \u201cAnd with anything in life, if it\u2019s valuable you\u2019ll have to work at it to achieve success. Most people working in direct selling are good at what they do, and find the extra few hundred pounds a month they make an extremely useful addition to their family\u2019s income. There are not many ways of earning that sort of money from home, on a highly flexible basis.\u201d</p> <p>Lisa now works for another MLM, but only sells products and refuses to recruit unless someone approaches her directly and asks about the business. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s incredibly hard to get a job after being a stay-at-home mum for eight years, network marketer for four,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Lindsay works at McDonald\u2019s, though struggles to get frequent shifts. She lost her Younique presenter status in July 2018 because she couldn\u2019t afford to buy any more stock. She feels unable to sell the old stock she bought back to the company because it is scattered around her home. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that I got out, but I\u2019m angry that I still see people recruiting,\u201d she says. She now sells handmade fabric cushions and lavender bags on online marketplace Etsy, and is currently applying for Personal Independence Payments.</p> <p>\u201cIt actually makes me angry with myself,\u201d Lindsay says, when I ask about the money she lost. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed with the person that got me into it, but I should have done more research. I always thought I was too smart for that sort of thing and I got so completely taken in.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 If you would like a comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p>",

      "bodyText": "When a Facebook friend told Lindsay about a \u201cgenius\u201d business opportunity in January 2015, the Manchester-based NHS laboratory assistant was already struggling for money. She had spent the last two years caring for her elderly father, and the stress meant she frequently missed shifts at work. Unwell with chronic fatigue syndrome and struggling to pay the household bills, Lindsay was instantly curious about her friend\u2019s offer. \u201cI hardly had any money coming in, and I was looking at everything, doing all the maths, and there just wasn\u2019t enough,\u201d Lindsay says now from the red brick terraced house where she lives alone with her dog, Freya. The Facebook friend \u2013 who Lindsay has never met, but added on social media because they were both fans of the musician Jean-Michel Jarre \u2013 told her she could earn between \u00a350 and \u00a3500 a month if she signed up to a beauty sales business called Younique. \u201cI thought even if I make \u00a3100 a month, that\u2019s something\u2026 I don\u2019t have a big appetite, so my food only costs \u00a320 a week at most, if I\u2019m splurging out a bit,\u201d Lindsay says. Though she is just 36 years old, she walks with a cane and has a full head of grey hair. Her illness \u2013 which is characterised by extreme tiredness and joint pain \u2013 means she struggles to maintain her home. Paint is peeling from the walls, and an old mattress sits in the hallway. After receiving her monthly paycheck, Lindsay clicked on the link sent over by her Facebook friend and signed up to become a \u201cYounique presenter\u201d. Founded in September 2012 by an American brother-and-sister team, Younique is a direct sales beauty company. Presenters sign up via the website and purchase products that they then sell on, earning a cut of the profits. Though there is no membership fee, members must regularly buy stock to retain presenter status. Lindsay paid \u00a369 for a starter kit, and then another \u00a3125 to become a \u201cyellow status\u201d presenter. Younique has eight different presenter statuses \u2013 whites, the people at the bottom, earn a 20% commission from their sales, while yellows, the next up in the scale, earn 25%. This commissions-based model is somewhat similar to Avon, the 133-year-old company that recruits \u201cAvon ladies\u201d to sell beauty products door-to-door. Yet unlike Avon ladies, Younique presenters buy and sell through social media \u2013 usually Facebook. \u201cWe are the first direct sales company to market and sell almost exclusively through the use of social media,\u201d Younique\u2019s website reads, adding that its founders, Derek Maxfield and Melanie Huscroft, created the business to \u201cuplift\u201d their members. \u201cDerek and Melanie firmly believe that all women [the company targets women] should feel valued, smart, and empowered through opportunities for personal growth and financial reward!\u201d the website says. But in her three years as a Younique presenter, Lindsay lost roughly \u00a33,000. From 2015 to 2018, Lindsay spent \u00a340 to \u00a360 every month on stock to retain her yellow presenter status. Though she initially made some sales at the hospital where she worked, Lindsay was let go from the NHS in spring 2015 because of missed shifts caused by stress. She had been caring for her parents since 2011 \u2013 her mother passed away from cancer in 2012, while her father had Parkinson\u2019s and suffered from three strokes before his death in 2018. Though she stopped making Younique sales after losing her job, Lindsay wanted to retain her presenter status because she was planning to go to university and hoped to be able to sell to fellow students. Meanwhile, Younique kept encouraging her to buy stock. \u201cThey would email saying, \u2018You\u2019re in danger of your account being suspended\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were worded in such a way to tell you, \u2018Oh, you only need to spend so much to keep yourself active.\u2019\u201d Lindsay says she didn\u2019t notice how much money she was spending on stock because it was a slow \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d of payments. \u201cBut then you look at it all together. I could have saved up, I could have done roof repairs on the house.\u201d In 2015, Lindsay attended a Younique training session in Glasgow where she was told not to \u201ccome with excuses\u201d about being unable to sell products. \u201cIt was made clear to me at that point, I had no get out clause for not making sales.\u201d Unsold makeup now sits in Lindsay\u2019s car, in her cupboards, and in a large plastic container in her living room. *** Younique is not just a direct sales company \u2013 like Avon, it is also a multi-level marketing scheme (MLM). Multi-level marketing is a business strategy where revenue is generated from both product sales and the recruitment of new distributors. A Younique presenter can earn money by selling makeup, and also by persuading other women to join the company. Structurally, MLMs are akin to pyramid schemes \u2013 once someone signs up under you, you become their \u201cupline\u201d and take a portion of their earnings. If they sign up people beneath them, you also take a cut of those profits \u2013 a handful of people at the top get rich from thousands at the bottom. Over the last five years, MLMs have become increasingly popular in Britain. The Direct Selling Association (DSA), the only recognised UK trade body for the sector, estimates that roughly 400,000 people in the UK are involved in direct selling, although many do so on a casual basis. Forever Living allows women to sell aloe vera-based drinks, gels and beauty products; Arbonne consultants sell skincare; Herbalife representatives flog weight-loss products; Juice Plus reps sell diet drinks; Nu Skin offers creams. Haircare MLM Monat is currently recruiting \u201cEU Founders\u201d. Social media means MLM presenters now sell to \u2013 and recruit from \u2013 the entire world. On Facebook, posts from uplines like Lindsay\u2019s friend promise \u201crocking\u201d sales, \u201cinstant\u201d pay, and the chance to run \u201cyour own business\u201d. \u201cThe main distinction between MLMs and pyramid schemes is MLMs actually have a product,\u201d says Daryl Koehn, a professor of business ethics at DePaul University in Chicago. \u201cIn pyramid schemes, you\u2019re just selling the opportunity to make money.\u201d Yet Koehn argues that even when MLMs have products, they become pyramid schemes if there is a high cost of entry or if presenters build up inventory they can\u2019t sell. In 2011, Jon M Taylor, an employee at the US Consumer Awareness Institute, compiled a short ebook on MLMs for the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cAfter reading these chapters, the reader may wonder if it is appropriate to refer to MLM, with its inherent flaws, as a \u2018business\u2019 at all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome who are familiar with MLM\u2019s abysmal statistics feel it is more appropriate to refer to virtually any MLM as a scam.\u201d In theory, anyone can sign up for an MLM. In practice, Koehn says the model appeals to \u201cpeople who have fewer opportunities\u201d. Like Lindsay, many people who join MLMs have disabilities, or poor health, and are unable to work full-time. Those who sign up are taught to target new and single mothers. \u201cWe were encouraged to pick on stay-at-home mums, people who had just lost a job,\u201d says Rachel (not her real name), a former Forever Living \u201cbusiness owner\u201d in her late 40s. She was recruited to Forever Living in 2016 as \u201ca newly single mum very willing to try anything to make a living for my kids\u201d, who were seven and nine at the time. Rachel\u2019s upline, a \u201ctrusted friend\u201d, told her to write a list of everyone she knew and \u201cprofile\u201d them, listing their aspirations and weaknesses. \u201cYou\u2019re encouraged to find out what it was they really want in life and then use that to promise that [Forever Living] would fulfil their want,\u201d she says. She was also given a recruiting script that included phrases such as \u201clifestyle-changing opportunity\u201d, \u201ccontrol your own destiny\u201d, and \u201cearn in excess of \u00a340k a year\u201d. She was told to avoid the word \u201cjob\u201d, partly because 9-5 jobs were presented as negative by the company, and partly, she believes, because Forever Living did not offer the consistent salary, paid holidays and sick pay that a traditional job would. It took six months for doubts to emerge, when she realised that the praise she initially received from her upline (\u201cYou\u2019re wonderful. You\u2019re perfect for this job,\u201d) was just a standard script used for all new recruits. Still, she stayed with Forever Living for nearly two more years. \u201cThey said your business is a rollercoaster, you just have to stay on it while it goes up and down,\u201d she explains, \u201cBut actually, it just went down, down, down.\u201d Rachel\u2019s uplines said her mindset was to blame when business was bad \u2013 linking her to seminars and success stories, and telling her that she had to attend online training sessions or she would fail. \u201cThere was a lot of emotional blackmail,\u201d she says. \u201cI would feel really guilty if I didn\u2019t attend fortnightly meetings.\u201d She says her upline encouraged her to \u201cstay away\u201d from people who criticised the company, including her own family. \u201cThey said if you don\u2019t work on your mindset, your business will fail,\u201d she says. Rachel had joined the company just after splitting from her husband, and says that Forever Living provided a new world for her to inhabit. She was in multiple Facebook groups where women competed to sell products, shared advice and scripts, and formed friendships. She was told to be \u201ca product of the product\u201d by purchasing Forever Living products for personal use. \u201cI put all of my passion and all of my time \u2013 oh my goodness, the amount of time,\u201d she says now. \u201cI totally gave up other things. And I wasn\u2019t making any money.\u201d After quitting, she was devastated over the friendships she lost \u2013 many of her Forever Living colleagues blocked her on social media when she left the company, and the isolation meant she suffered a \u201cmild depression\u201d. She also still struggles with guilt from signing up a handful of women beneath her. \u201cI have since apologised to them all. Some of them are still trying to offload products that they\u2019ve got hanging around their house. I feel really awful. But I also think, I can\u2019t stay guilty forever, because I was sucked in. I believed everything they said.\u201d Rachel felt trapped: \u201cthey have you in this grip, this cultish grip,\u201d she says. \u201cCult\u201d is a word that every woman I speak to for this piece uses to refer to their time in an MLM. Many sell \u201cmindset training\u201d sessions to their presenters. \u201cNever let anyone tell you that you won\u2019t succeed,\u201d reads a slide from a presentation Rachel paid \u00a330 to stream. \u201cThe greatest comeback is to SHOW them your success.\u201d Fiona, a single mother of two from Merseyside, lost more than \u00a31,000 selling Arbonne cosmetics in 2016. She says her upline, a local woman who she met while working as a teaching assistant in a school, pressured her to \u201cprey\u201d on new mothers in soft play areas; after she convinced another single mother to join, she was told to pressure her into buying more products. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right,\u201d she says. Fiona\u2019s upline also told her to take out a credit card to buy stock \u2013 she is still paying off the debt. During her 10 months at Arbonne, she was encouraged to set an alarm for 6.40am so she could listen to a motivational talk given live by an upline. \u201cIt\u2019s like brainwashing,\u201d she says, explaining that, like Rachel, she was told to become a \u201cproduct of the product\u201d by buying Arbonne for herself. \u201cIt\u2019s really easy to get drawn into it, particularly because at the time, as a single mum, I wasn\u2019t seeing an awful lot of other people.\u201d Members are encouraged to influence others by inflating their success on social media. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of lies,\u201d Lindsay says, \u201cWe were told if you\u2019re going somewhere nice, post it with, \u2018Thanks to Younique, I\u2019m staying here.\u2019\u201d Rachel says people who were struggling would post pictures of cars, spas, and prosecco to appear as though their business was thriving. Fiona says people were even encouraged to post pictures of their children if they were home sick from school, adding captions like, \u201cSo grateful I have a home-based business which allows me to carry on working while I care for my kids.\u201d Despite the social media scripts and many motivational sessions, Rachel says she never received any financial training or advice from Forever Living. It was only after she did her second year\u2019s tax return that she realised she hadn\u2019t made a profit and decided to quit. \u201cYou\u2019re not coached on how to manage your finances because if they did that, people would realise they weren\u2019t making any money.\u201d A UK spokesperson for Forever Living says via email that the company offers financial training through an independent accountancy company intermittently throughout the year. \u201cThe Forever network has been built over 40 years through collaboration, support and family values,\u201d they said. \u201cForever does not condone pressure of any description, misrepresentation of lifestyle, the business opportunity or promises of income levels, the company has clearly defined escalation procedures to deal with any such allegations.\u201d An online company policy handbook lists prohibited activities for Forever members, and refers to the DSA\u2019s dispute handling service. The spokesperson adds that Forever representatives are \u201cprohibited from placing orders until 75% of previous stock has been sold\u201d. This is done on what the company call a \u201cself-certifying\u201d basis, ie the seller tells them they have sold or used at least this much stock. When asked about Fiona\u2019s experiences, an Arbonne spokesperson based in Northampton says via email that their sales plan is \u201cnot a pyramid scheme; it is a standard, legal sales strategy\u201d. \u201cArbonne upholds the highest standards of integrity and we do not condone deceptive, unethical or illegal practices of any kind,\u201d the spokesperson says. \u201cOur Business Ethics Standards Team (BEST) conducts regular training sessions with Arbonne Independent Consultants, continuously monitors their business practices \u2026 and takes immediate action if questionable activities arise.\u201d They add that any unethical or improper behaviour can be reported at BEST.Arbonne.com. Fiona says she was not made aware of this reporting procedure. *** If Lindsay was at the bottom of the Younique pyramid, then Lisa was at the top. The mother of three lives with her husband and children in a spacious semi-detached council house in a cul-de-sac outside of Halifax. A confident 36-year-old, she is immaculately put together, with sleek long black hair and stylish, minimal makeup. She first heard about Younique in 2014. \u201cBecause I have three children, I needed a job that would fit around them,\u201d she says from her living room \u2013 there are professional portraits of the children on the walls, a bookcase full of sports trophies, and, on the table, a felt pencil case her daughter recently made at school. Lisa joined Younique on the first day of its UK launch and went on to earn more than \u00a360,000 before she quit in 2018. \u201cIt was quite strange because I immediately had 38 people in my team,\u201d she says, explaining she had recruited 12 of these people, and the other 26 were people they in turn signed on. \u201cWe\u2019d all joined on the same day but suddenly I was in charge.\u201d While white and yellow Younique presenters only earn commission from their sales, after recruiting five women, members reach pink status. Pink status presenters earn 25% from their sales plus 3% commission from sales made by women beneath them. By the time she left Younique, Lisa had reached the highest level, black status, and had more than 3,000 people beneath her. She calculates that 95% of her money was earned from commission on other women\u2019s sales. \u201cI made a lot of a money, a lot of money to me, and it meant I could stay at home with my kids,\u201d she says, adding that she also felt a boost in confidence. \u201cI went from not being able to pick up the phone to an unknown number to talking on stage in front of thousands of people.\u201d Lisa frequently spoke at Younique training sessions and conventions. Yet although Lisa feels Younique changed her life, her perspective shifted in 2018. Lisa says that during a Black Friday sales month in November, she slowly realised people felt pressured to buy stock they couldn\u2019t sell. \u201cThe leaders would always say nobody\u2019s forcing anybody to buy anything, but if you\u2019re recruiting women who\u2019ve lost a circle of friends because they\u2019ve had children, or they haven\u2019t got self-confidence, they\u2019re going to buy to be part of a group.\u201d Kirsty, a 27-year-old from London, tells me: \u201cI got suckered in to Younique due to the promise of \u2018sisterhood\u2019 being so strongly pushed on to me. I suffer with bipolar so I don\u2019t really make a lot of friends that easily,\u201d she says over the phone. A Facebook friend told her she would have access to a group chat of 300 people who supported each other. \u201cThat was appealing,\u201d she tells me. Yet Kirsty quickly found the group chat \u201ctoxic\u201d. \u201cOne woman said her husband was telling her to get a regular job because they were losing money, but the group was bizarre, telling her he was controlling and abusive,\u201d she alleges. \u201cIt also got really bitchy \u2013 one girl wasn\u2019t making enough sales and they made her feel bad in front of everyone.\u201d Ironically, while women are often drawn to MLMs to make friends, they often end up with fewer than when they started. \u201cOne of the issues with MLMs is that you\u2019re told to target your friends and relatives,\u201d says business professor Koehn. \u201cPeople are trying to monetise social relationships.\u201d Rachel lost friendships because she \u201cpestered people every five minutes\u201d to sign up for Forever Living. She was told that if someone said \u201cno\u201d, she should write their name in a book called \u201cno for now\u201d and ask them again in a month. \u201cBecause I was encouraged to pester people every five minutes to sign up, friendships disappeared.\u201d But alliances made within the business are also fragile \u2013 often falling apart once women quit. \u201cSome people blocked me immediately,\u201d says Lisa of her decision to leave. \u201cWe spoke every day and all of sudden, we can\u2019t be friends.\u201d Rachel was particularly affected when she quit. \u201cThat was the thing that really got me in the end,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I\u2019d made friends and then when I did leave, I had nobody.\u201d *** When so many women feel exploited by MLMs, why have these companies not been held to account? In America, clothing MLM LuLaRoe is currently being sued by Washington state attorney general Bob Ferguson, who says that \u201cLuLaRoe tricked consumers into buying into its pyramid scheme with deceptive claims.\u201d LulaRoe said in a statement that the claims are completely without merit and that the company will fight vigorously against them. In July 2017, the Chinese government shut down hundreds of multi-level marketing companies, which it described as \u201cbusiness cults\u201d. Yet in the UK, no authorities are currently investigating them. Mumsnet decided in 2017 not to allow MLMs to advertise on the parenting site. \u201cWe thought about it long and hard because we know that home-based, flexible opportunities are very popular,\u201d says founder Justine Roberts, \u201cbut many Mumsnet users have posted about what they see as MLMs\u2019 invidious marketing techniques and the effects on vulnerable individuals, and we came to the conclusion that business models based primarily on recruiting have too much potential to be exploitative.\u201d Elsewhere online, hundreds of ordinary people are now campaigning against MLMs on social media. \u201cI think the authorities are doing an absolutely embarrassing job at regulating MLMs,\u201d says John Evans, a 39-year-old from Sussex who runs the 11,000-member Facebook group MLM Lies Exposed. He was inspired to start the group after a friend tried to recruit him to an MLM. When Evans criticised the MLM model, his friend stopped speaking to him. \u201cMLMs are extremely clever at manipulating people. There\u2019s lots of psychology involved,\u201d Evans says. \u201cThe people who sign up lose money, but they\u2019re not stupid. They\u2019re victims.\u201d Evans says he has seen countless horror stories in the five years he has run his Facebook page. \u201cSome people are thousands of pounds down from these companies and they end up in the sunk cost fallacy where they just keep plugging away, keep desperately trying to dig themselves out of this financial hole,\u201d he says. Evans is particularly concerned when MLM reps make false medical claims about products on social media. A representative for Trading Standards explains MLMs become an issue for the body if a company breaches consumer protection regulations, by, for example, making misleading claims about products. In 2017, Trading Standards Cornwall shut down the business of former Miss England finalist, Charlotte Thomson, who had been selling weight-loss coffee Valentus, saying the product wasn\u2019t licensed for the UK market. Thomson said she was \u201cdevastated\u201d and stopped selling the product. To date, Trading Standards has not looked into any MLMs on a national level. Evans and others would like to see MLMs better regulated to ensure companies are open and honest when recruiting presenters. A spokesperson for Younique said that Lindsay, Lisa, and Kirsty\u2019s experiences \u201cdo not accurately reflect those of our hundreds of thousands of Younique presenters around the world, nor our organisation\u2019s values more fundamentally\u201d. The company says it does not permit presenters to make \u201cimproper claims\u201d about earnings or products, and has a team of compliance officers to ensure all presenters abide by company expectations. \u201cYounique presenters are not required to build product inventories at all,\u201d they go on. \u201cAdditionally, we aim to safeguard our presenters\u2019 financial security by enabling unused products purchased by them within the prior year to be returned for a full refund should they wish to terminate their relationship with the business.\u201d Younique, Arbonne, and Forever Living are all members of The Direct Selling Association (DSA). I put the claims in this article to them, including accounts of uplines making false claims about earnings and pressuring downlines into buying stock, and the DSA says they are investigating the allegations. Susannah Schofield, director general of the DSA, warns that people should \u201cbeware of individuals making outlandish claims about direct selling being a chance to \u2018get rich quick\u2019 \u2013 anything that looks or sounds too good to be true probably is\u201d. She adds that direct sales is \u201can effort-based\u201d business. \u201cAnd with anything in life, if it\u2019s valuable you\u2019ll have to work at it to achieve success. Most people working in direct selling are good at what they do, and find the extra few hundred pounds a month they make an extremely useful addition to their family\u2019s income. There are not many ways of earning that sort of money from home, on a highly flexible basis.\u201d Lisa now works for another MLM, but only sells products and refuses to recruit unless someone approaches her directly and asks about the business. \u201c\u2018It\u2019s incredibly hard to get a job after being a stay-at-home mum for eight years, network marketer for four,\u201d she says. Lindsay works at McDonald\u2019s, though struggles to get frequent shifts. She lost her Younique presenter status in July 2018 because she couldn\u2019t afford to buy any more stock. She feels unable to sell the old stock she bought back to the company because it is scattered around her home. \u201cI\u2019m relieved that I got out, but I\u2019m angry that I still see people recruiting,\u201d she says. She now sells handmade fabric cushions and lavender bags on online marketplace Etsy, and is currently applying for Personal Independence Payments. \u201cIt actually makes me angry with myself,\u201d Lindsay says, when I ask about the money she lost. \u201cI\u2019m annoyed with the person that got me into it, but I should have done more research. I always thought I was too smart for that sort of thing and I got so completely taken in.\u201d \u2022 If you would like a comment to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).",

      "bodyText": "Pat McGrath Labs, the beauty range created by the British makeup artist Pat McGrath, has achieved the highest cosmetics turnover in its first month on sale at Selfridges of any brand in the department store\u2019s history. The Oxford Street department store collaborated with Pat McGrath Labs on its largest-ever retail takeover, A Technicolour Odyssey, dedicating 155 sq metres of its shop floor to a branded pop-up space, as well as giving over 24 of its 27 famous windows to the partnership. The launch in April saw Selfridges achieve the best daily cosmetics sales in its history, with the sale of a Pat McGrath Labs product every 40 seconds. The brand was launched in 2015 as one of the first to pioneer the digital-first business model, with customers switching their allegiance from more established cosmetics houses to niche upstarts and makeup-artist-led ranges. \u201cI think what people respond to in the end is the product and the quality,\u201d says McGrath, whose launch party at the department store drew guests such as her friend and long-term collaborator Edward Enninful, British Vogue\u2019s editor-in-chief, as well as models, designers and celebrities she has worked with throughout her career. \u201cYou can have the most inspiring influencer or fabulous figurehead at the helm, but if the formulas are not working, you can pack your bags and close up shop.

But for some, it can lead to another drastic life change: a brand new career.</p> <p>Moving to another part of the country can allow renters and homebuyers alike \u2013 particularly those leaving London and its sky-high property costs \u2013 to not only begin afresh but also get more bang for their buck and start up that long-dreamed-about business, perhaps a coffee shop, a music venue or yoga studio.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted peace, community and to make my money work</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thirty-five-year-old Polly Donger\u2019s unlikely change of career from actor to shopkeeper occurred when she decided to quit London and move to Margate in Kent two years ago. \u201cI had major anxiety in London,\u201d she says. \u201cI had so much anxiety that I couldn\u2019t go on the tube and had to stop working as an actor. I wanted peace, community and to make my money work \u2013 whether that was investing in a property or setting up a business.\u201d Donger was not sure what that business might be, until one day when she looked at her colourful Pinterest board. \u201cI realised I had an aptitude for seeking out awesome independent makers, and while I thought I can\u2019t draw, I can put stuff in a space and make it look pretty,\u201d she says. She found a two-bedroom flat with a retail space below. Her shop, <a href=\"https://littlebitmargate.com/\" title=\"\">Little Bit</a>, which stocks independent brands, acrylic jewellery, clothing and gifts, opened in summer 2017.</p> <p>\u201cFinancially, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it in London,\u201d she says. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I could do this anywhere else. I\u2019m lucky as the people who come down to the Turner [art gallery] are the people who want to spend money in this kind of shop.\u201d</p> <p>Although Donger misses the theatre, she says the shop keeps her on her toes and provides an unlikely source of inspiration. \u201cWeirdly, I have met two of my comedy heroes in the shop, and I could write thousands of comedy shows based on the characters I\u2019ve met in here.\u201d</p> <p>She is one of the growing numbers of people saying goodbye to the capital. According to Office for National Statistics data analysed by estate agent Knight Frank, <a href=\"https://www.knightfrank.co.uk/blog/2018/06/28/london-leavers-reach-new-high\" title=\"\">106,607 people left London in the year to June 2017</a> \u2013 a 55% hike from five years earlier.

I was more interested in climbing and hiking, and we started to look for ways to be closer to the country.\u201d The couple were attracted to the idea of running a hotel. \u201cWe quite like people and thought it would be nice to get our teeth into running a hotel. We\u2019ve always loved hotels and food.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We were quite nervous about being \u2018soft southerners\u2019, but we were shocked at how accepting everyone was</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The couple homed in on the Lake District. \u201cI\u2019d holidayed as a child in the Lakes,\u201d recalls Peter, 37. The couple bought <a href=\"http://brownberhall.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Brownber Hall</a> in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, for \u00a3650,000, using a \u00a3450,000 loan and profits from the flat in Haggerston, east London, that they sold. They spent \u00a370,000 on renovating the eight-bedroom property.</p> <p>But making a fresh start in a new industry has not been without its challenges. \u201cThe biggest learning curve was actually starting a new business,\u201d says Peter. \u201cChallenges included: how do you actually do the books and submit a VAT tax return, and which suppliers should you work with for your laundry? It was also good fun but was challenging.\u201d</p> <p>The couple seem to have overcome those obstacles. Three years later and the hotel\u2019s occupancy has jumped from 20% to 72%, and the pair have adapted to their new life in the north. \u201cWe were quite nervous about being outsiders and \u2018soft southerners\u2019, and thought we might stand out like a sore thumb, but we were shocked at how accepting everyone was. Neighbours dropped round with cards, another person showed us where the vets was.

I was later diagnosed with ME/CFS.\u201d One way she found relief was through baking. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved baking and used to bake with my mum as a child. When I moved to Leeds into my PR role, I started a baking blog. I would bring my test bakes into the office and everyone would go crazy for them. I realised I could turn the blog into a business.\u201d</p> <p>For Pearson, the move helped overcome the financial pressures of setting up a new business. \u201cOur rent in Leeds was very expensive: we paid \u00a3825 a month before bills for a small two-bed flat. I needed to buy a car to deliver my cakes, but a car park space alone was another \u00a370 a month. Our flat didn\u2019t have a dishwasher, and we were told it wasn\u2019t possible to have one fitted. Our new flat is twice the size of our previous flat, with a much bigger kitchen.

      "bodyText": "Filling up a removal van with your belongings and heading to a new area can mean huge upheavals across every aspect of your life, whether it\u2019s a new school for the children, saying goodbye to old friends or just a whole new neighbourhood to explore and find your way around. But for some, it can lead to another drastic life change: a brand new career. Moving to another part of the country can allow renters and homebuyers alike \u2013 particularly those leaving London and its sky-high property costs \u2013 to not only begin afresh but also get more bang for their buck and start up that long-dreamed-about business, perhaps a coffee shop, a music venue or yoga studio. Thirty-five-year-old Polly Donger\u2019s unlikely change of career from actor to shopkeeper occurred when she decided to quit London and move to Margate in Kent two years ago. \u201cI had major anxiety in London,\u201d she says. \u201cI had so much anxiety that I couldn\u2019t go on the tube and had to stop working as an actor. I wanted peace, community and to make my money work \u2013 whether that was investing in a property or setting up a business.\u201d Donger was not sure what that business might be, until one day when she looked at her colourful Pinterest board. \u201cI realised I had an aptitude for seeking out awesome independent makers, and while I thought I can\u2019t draw, I can put stuff in a space and make it look pretty,\u201d she says. She found a two-bedroom flat with a retail space below. Her shop, Little Bit, which stocks independent brands, acrylic jewellery, clothing and gifts, opened in summer 2017. \u201cFinancially, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it in London,\u201d she says. \u201cActually, I don\u2019t think I could do this anywhere else. I\u2019m lucky as the people who come down to the Turner [art gallery] are the people who want to spend money in this kind of shop.\u201d Although Donger misses the theatre, she says the shop keeps her on her toes and provides an unlikely source of inspiration. \u201cWeirdly, I have met two of my comedy heroes in the shop, and I could write thousands of comedy shows based on the characters I\u2019ve met in here.\u201d She is one of the growing numbers of people saying goodbye to the capital. According to Office for National Statistics data analysed by estate agent Knight Frank, 106,607 people left London in the year to June 2017 \u2013 a 55% hike from five years earlier. One of the reasons behind the exodus is, of course, house prices. Amanda and Peter Jacques-Walker were in their early thirties when they felt ready to leave London. \u201cI was working as a management consultant and Amanda as a barrister,\u201d says Peter. \u201cWe\u2019d worked in London since university, which was fine and we enjoyed it, but I was starting to feel done with London. I was more interested in climbing and hiking, and we started to look for ways to be closer to the country.\u201d The couple were attracted to the idea of running a hotel. \u201cWe quite like people and thought it would be nice to get our teeth into running a hotel. We\u2019ve always loved hotels and food.\u201d The couple homed in on the Lake District. \u201cI\u2019d holidayed as a child in the Lakes,\u201d recalls Peter, 37. The couple bought Brownber Hall in Kirkby Stephen, Cumbria, for \u00a3650,000, using a \u00a3450,000 loan and profits from the flat in Haggerston, east London, that they sold. They spent \u00a370,000 on renovating the eight-bedroom property. But making a fresh start in a new industry has not been without its challenges. \u201cThe biggest learning curve was actually starting a new business,\u201d says Peter. \u201cChallenges included: how do you actually do the books and submit a VAT tax return, and which suppliers should you work with for your laundry? It was also good fun but was challenging.\u201d The couple seem to have overcome those obstacles. Three years later and the hotel\u2019s occupancy has jumped from 20% to 72%, and the pair have adapted to their new life in the north. \u201cWe were quite nervous about being outsiders and \u2018soft southerners\u2019, and thought we might stand out like a sore thumb, but we were shocked at how accepting everyone was. Neighbours dropped round with cards, another person showed us where the vets was. They\u2019ve been really accepting.\u201d Alice Pearson, 25, only moved less than 20 miles away, but quitting her digital PR and marketing job in Leeds in 2017 to move to Ilkley in West Yorkshire with her boyfriend helped her establish her cake business, Copper Spoon Cakery. \u201cWe were renting a flat in Leeds and it was expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cOur kitchen was really small and without a dishwasher, which was a nightmare when baking.\u201d On top of the inadequately sized flat, she says busy city life and the stress of her job were taking a toll on her mental health. \u201cI suffered anxiety daily and also felt physically ill most days. I was later diagnosed with ME/CFS.\u201d One way she found relief was through baking. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved baking and used to bake with my mum as a child. When I moved to Leeds into my PR role, I started a baking blog. I would bring my test bakes into the office and everyone would go crazy for them. I realised I could turn the blog into a business.\u201d For Pearson, the move helped overcome the financial pressures of setting up a new business. \u201cOur rent in Leeds was very expensive: we paid \u00a3825 a month before bills for a small two-bed flat. I needed to buy a car to deliver my cakes, but a car park space alone was another \u00a370 a month. Our flat didn\u2019t have a dishwasher, and we were told it wasn\u2019t possible to have one fitted. Our new flat is twice the size of our previous flat, with a much bigger kitchen. We have the space to store everything without having to pay for a storage unit, which would be another \u00a3170 a month.\u201d The rent at their flat in Ilkley is \u00a3100 a month cheaper than their former home in Leeds, and also includes a private car parking space. \u201cI\u2019ve used this extra money to buy a car, which we pay off every month,\u201d says Pearson. She is the first to admit that the spa town of Ilkley is a contrast to buzzy Leeds, and she does miss her old life once in a while. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s been worth it to have my new business and a lovely flat,\u201d she says. \u201cPlus, we\u2019re a stone\u2019s throw away from the moors; it\u2019s really lovely to be able to take yourself away from the hustle and bustle. I\u2019ve found moving away from the city has been great for my mental health \u2013 I no longer suffer daily with anxiety, and my ME symptoms have improved as I\u2019m less stressed.\u201d Plus, she says, she can reach Leeds in 30 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d Despite the minimum one-and-a-half-hours commute each way, it wasn\u2019t until about four years after swapping London for Margate that Kate and George Winteringham, a store designer for Alexander McQueen and an interior designer respectively, quit their jobs in the capital to open KG Winters, a greengrocers in the Kent seaside town in October last year. Kate, 34, is the first to say that the couple hadn\u2019t harboured an ambition to open a greengrocers. Rather, the switch came after discovering the area was lacking in greengrocers and fresh produce. \u201cIt being the \u2018garden of England\u2019, we expected there to be more fresh produce available, but over the years of living here, we found it difficult to get hold of,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had to drive out of town to farm shops.

      "body": "<h2>Katherine Butler, joint head of Guardian Opinion</h2> <p>Seven million people turned to the wisdom of the Guardian\u2019s comment writers in the 24 hours after the EU referendum result in June 2016. Three years on, it feels disturbing to admit that Brexit, for our small team of opinion editors, is the gift that keeps on giving.</p> <p>With political opinions two a penny on the web, the scale of our traffic perhaps says a lot about the value of rapid but trusted, carefully commissioned and edited<strong> </strong>analysis in helping navigate an issue as polarising and open to factual distortion as Brexit. As the theatrics of Westminster voting, resignations and government defeats played out, many readers said they also found the Brexit-themed satire provided by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/marinahyde\">Marina Hyde</a> on our Saturday pages an essential form of therapy.</p> <p>The big surprise is how even the seemingly dry detail can ignite fierce debate. Article 50. Customs union. WTO rules. Meaningful votes. Indicative votes. Backstop to the backstop. With the stakes so high, bring it on, readers seem to say.</p> <p>Seeing this level of engagement with the complexities of the UK/EU relationship can be bittersweet. Back in the 1990s I reported on the EU from Brussels, competing (in vain, it usually felt) to convey the complicated reality against the Eurosceptic drumbeat.</p> <p>So tense has the national mood been lately that you have to guard against unwittingly raising hopes of the impasse ending. A recent column was initially headlined: \u201cBritain will have a second referendum - on 23 May\u201d. Only when it started to spread like wildfire around the internet did it become clear that people were frantically sharing it because they hoped <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/18/european-elections-second-brexit-referendum-vote-register\">our columnist had exclusive news to impart</a>, rather than a view on the EU elections.</p> <h2>Joseph Harker, deputy opinion editor</h2> <p>The first appearance of the word \u201cBrexit\u201d in a Guardian Opinion article was written by our columnist Timothy Garton Ash in December 2012. Headlined \u201cA referendum on Europe? Bring it on, for all our sakes\u201d, it read:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Unlike many of my pro-European friends, I think we will win. I do not believe the brains of the British people have been so addled by the Sun and Daily Mail that they will, confronted with the facts about what it is really like to be Norway (without the oil) or Switzerland, decide that exit \u2013 Brexit or Brixit \u2013 is the best option for this country.</p> </blockquote> <p>Fateful words.</p> <p>Our in-house columnists have been amazing at filing within minutes of some of the most dramatic and unexpected moments. And, beyond that, we\u2019ve tried to give bigger-picture pieces as well.</p> <p>One of the first, and still most memorable, was Mike Carter\u2019s report of his walk through Britain\u2019s post-industrial heartlands shortly before the vote. Headlined \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/27/liverpool-london-brexit-leave-eu-referendum\">I walked from Liverpool to London. Brexit was no surprise</a>\u201d, it gave a stark portrayal of the human stories of left-behind Britain. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/30/boris-johnson-super-canada-plan-not-work-brexit-conservative-party-conference-gina-miller\">campaigners such as Gina Miller</a> have been hugely well read too.</p> <p>With Brexit showing little sign of ending any time soon, all of us on the opinion desk will try to keep our readers informed through a range of diverse voices, whatever happens in the weeks and months ahead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"42a2a98d966ecb005e7f67832876ace887dbea75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/42a2a98d966ecb005e7f67832876ace887dbea75/0_179_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The desk at work: There\u2019s a delight for the obsessive (a category most editors fall into) in following the drama.

Brexit is stuffed full of gossip, speculation and nailbiting votes.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Sonia Sodha, deputy opinion editor and columnist; chief leader writer, the Observer</h2> <p>Brexit is simultaneously a columnist\u2019s dream and nightmare. A dream because who could complain about having politics of the very highest stakes to interpret, week in week out? A nightmare not just because of what\u2019s actually at stake \u2013 the outcome of Brexit will of course determine the future of our country for decades to come \u2013 but, on a much more parochial level, how to respond when something significant seems to happen every week, but nothing ever seems to change.</p> <p>My approach has been to try to focus on what all the Westminster shenanigans could mean for where we ultimately end up, rather than on the archaic parliamentary procedure. It would be easy to let the excitement and unpredictability that comes with being in politically uncharted territory mask the troubling lack of responsible political leadership that has left us where we are today. It\u2019s our job to point that out.<br></p> <h2>Toby Moses, deputy opinion editor</h2> <p>Never has a news story of such importance lasted so long, with such a high frequency of crunch moments that have failed to deliver any kind of resolution. The challenge of commissioning on a topic which is constantly developing and yet somehow never changes lies in finding new angles.</p> <p>Views can be predictable, so when we can find an expert to present a perspective on what Brexit is doing in their area \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/may/09/trade-deals-standards-employment-farmers-brexit\">farmer</a> or a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/31/prescription-drug-brexit-pharmacy-supply-chains-shortages\">pharmacist</a> \u2013 it adds something new.</p> <p>The fact that the appetite from readers is voracious, with every twist and turn pored over, means other stories can be crowded out. Most of the problems with the world that pre-date Brexit are still there, and getting worse, but the space for them has narrowed. Thankfully, we have excellent columnists who are all too aware of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/12/britain-austerity-brexit-economy-recession-regions\">continuing harm being done by austerity</a> and the conflicts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/05/jamal-khashoggi-coverage-victim-saudi\">costing thousands of lives around the world.</a> Our responsibility as editors is to make sure those stories are promoted to give our readers a broad range of comment to absorb.

      "bodyText": "Katherine Butler, joint head of Guardian Opinion Seven million people turned to the wisdom of the Guardian\u2019s comment writers in the 24 hours after the EU referendum result in June 2016. Three years on, it feels disturbing to admit that Brexit, for our small team of opinion editors, is the gift that keeps on giving. With political opinions two a penny on the web, the scale of our traffic perhaps says a lot about the value of rapid but trusted, carefully commissioned and edited analysis in helping navigate an issue as polarising and open to factual distortion as Brexit. As the theatrics of Westminster voting, resignations and government defeats played out, many readers said they also found the Brexit-themed satire provided by Marina Hyde on our Saturday pages an essential form of therapy. The big surprise is how even the seemingly dry detail can ignite fierce debate. Article 50. Customs union. WTO rules. Meaningful votes. Indicative votes. Backstop to the backstop. With the stakes so high, bring it on, readers seem to say. Seeing this level of engagement with the complexities of the UK/EU relationship can be bittersweet. Back in the 1990s I reported on the EU from Brussels, competing (in vain, it usually felt) to convey the complicated reality against the Eurosceptic drumbeat. So tense has the national mood been lately that you have to guard against unwittingly raising hopes of the impasse ending. A recent column was initially headlined: \u201cBritain will have a second referendum - on 23 May\u201d. Only when it started to spread like wildfire around the internet did it become clear that people were frantically sharing it because they hoped our columnist had exclusive news to impart, rather than a view on the EU elections. Joseph Harker, deputy opinion editor The first appearance of the word \u201cBrexit\u201d in a Guardian Opinion article was written by our columnist Timothy Garton Ash in December 2012. Headlined \u201cA referendum on Europe? Bring it on, for all our sakes\u201d, it read: Unlike many of my pro-European friends, I think we will win. I do not believe the brains of the British people have been so addled by the Sun and Daily Mail that they will, confronted with the facts about what it is really like to be Norway (without the oil) or Switzerland, decide that exit \u2013 Brexit or Brixit \u2013 is the best option for this country. Fateful words. Our in-house columnists have been amazing at filing within minutes of some of the most dramatic and unexpected moments. And, beyond that, we\u2019ve tried to give bigger-picture pieces as well. One of the first, and still most memorable, was Mike Carter\u2019s report of his walk through Britain\u2019s post-industrial heartlands shortly before the vote. Headlined \u201cI walked from Liverpool to London. Brexit was no surprise\u201d, it gave a stark portrayal of the human stories of left-behind Britain. And campaigners such as Gina Miller have been hugely well read too. With Brexit showing little sign of ending any time soon, all of us on the opinion desk will try to keep our readers informed through a range of diverse voices, whatever happens in the weeks and months ahead. Sonia Sodha, deputy opinion editor and columnist; chief leader writer, the Observer Brexit is simultaneously a columnist\u2019s dream and nightmare. A dream because who could complain about having politics of the very highest stakes to interpret, week in week out? A nightmare not just because of what\u2019s actually at stake \u2013 the outcome of Brexit will of course determine the future of our country for decades to come \u2013 but, on a much more parochial level, how to respond when something significant seems to happen every week, but nothing ever seems to change. My approach has been to try to focus on what all the Westminster shenanigans could mean for where we ultimately end up, rather than on the archaic parliamentary procedure. It would be easy to let the excitement and unpredictability that comes with being in politically uncharted territory mask the troubling lack of responsible political leadership that has left us where we are today. It\u2019s our job to point that out. Toby Moses, deputy opinion editor Never has a news story of such importance lasted so long, with such a high frequency of crunch moments that have failed to deliver any kind of resolution. The challenge of commissioning on a topic which is constantly developing and yet somehow never changes lies in finding new angles. Views can be predictable, so when we can find an expert to present a perspective on what Brexit is doing in their area \u2013 a farmer or a pharmacist \u2013 it adds something new. The fact that the appetite from readers is voracious, with every twist and turn pored over, means other stories can be crowded out. Most of the problems with the world that pre-date Brexit are still there, and getting worse, but the space for them has narrowed. Thankfully, we have excellent columnists who are all too aware of the continuing harm being done by austerity and the conflicts costing thousands of lives around the world. Our responsibility as editors is to make sure those stories are promoted to give our readers a broad range of comment to absorb. It can feel as if Brexit is the only thing happening in the world. It isn\u2019t, and the opinion pages reflect that. David Shariatmadari, deputy opinion editor Editing in times of Brexit can be a lot of fun and really rewarding. There\u2019s a delight for the obsessive (a category most editors fall into) in following the drama. Brexit is stuffed full of gossip, speculation and nailbiting votes.

This isn\u2019t strictly true: I was eight months old when the club won their last domestic league title in April 1990, a record 18th, after a period of 80s domination. But we have not won since the creation of the Premier League in 1992. In the next decades, our great rivals Manchester United were notoriously successful in \u201cknocking Liverpool off their fucking perch\u201d, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/08/sir-alex-ferguson-best-quotes\" title=\"\">Alex Ferguson put it</a> when they surpassed our record. Unlikely candidates \u2013 Leeds United (1992), Blackburn Rovers (1995), Leicester City (2016) \u2013 have all won the league since we did. I won\u2019t pretend it doesn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>It still hurts, because this season, one of the most exciting of recent times, Liverpool were pipped to the post by Manchester City (my grandad\u2019s club, who have gone from sodden terraces of disappointment to UAE-bankrolled world beaters).</p> <p>Even people with a passing interest in football admitted the race caught their attention. The top spot changed hands 32 times. We lost <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/03/manchester-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">only a single league game</a> all season: to Manchester City, at a time when a win would have taken us 10 points clear. City won the title with 98 points. Liverpool, with 97, were the highest-scoring runners-up in history. The heartbreak was tempered by a pride in how \u201cthe boys\u201d played and developed. But also: a stunning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">Champions League semi-final triumph over Barcelona</a> was the real consolation. More on this later.</p> <p>Supporting Liverpool is as much a vocation as a hobby. Fans of clubs that are consistently mid-range performers \u2013 or in the lower leagues, with centre-halves who double as plumbers or firemen \u2013 rightly get credit for sticking with teams that have little chance of glory. But imagine supporting a club that once ruled supreme, but has been reduced to domestic also-rans. I have many friends from the generation before me, not from Liverpool, who support the club due to our dominance during their 80s childhoods. There are also Reds supporters around the world, rather disparagingly known as \u201carmchair fans\u201d, which is unfair: if you\u2019re in, say, Nigeria, that\u2019s quite the journey to make. It also suggests the rest of us are lacing up and actually contributing on the pitch.

When I accepted an invitation to speak at the Hay festival in January, it never occurred to me to check what day this year\u2019s Champions League final was being played. Spurs reached the knockout stages of the competition thanks to a late goal away to Barcelona, but that was the limit of my ambition. The final was for other clubs \u2013 bigger, slicker clubs. Then we thumped top German side Borussia Dortmund. That wasn\u2019t what we do, I told myself. Normal service will soon be resumed. Next came all-conquering Manchester City. All the way up to the Etihad Stadium I asked myself what I was doing, making a 400-mile round trip that was bound to end in disappointment. I thought Spurs had blown it, in classic Spurs style, conceding a goal in the dying moments of injury time. A minute later came the VAR offside ruling. I drove home in shock. That wasn\u2019t what we do, I told myself. Normal service will soon be resumed. The second leg of the semi-final against Ajax appeared to be going entirely to plan.

Liverpool won, thanks to a penalty shootout performance by the keeper Jerzy Dudek inspired by our former goalie, Bruce Grobbelaar, whose \u201cspaghetti legs\u201d had so unnerved Roma spot kickers in a 1984 European final. It was the fifth time we had won Europe\u2019s top competition. The club were rewarded by taking the actual cup home, not a replica: this one\u2019s for keeps. The scenes that night in Liverpool were Scouse bacchanalia. All thoughts of biology revision were out of the window as my teen group took to the streets to join the joyous red army stopping traffic, faces flushed Liverpool red. An estimated one million people came out for the open-top bus victory parade. But our history is tinged with tragedy. In the 1985 European Cup final against Juventus, held in the Heysel Stadium in Brussels, 39 people (mostly Juventus fans) died in a crush. Just four years later, the Hillsborough disaster resulted in the death of 96 Liverpool fans. The Sun newspaper, which smeared fans with wholly false stories, is still rarely seen in the city. It took over a quarter of a century for an inquiry to come to the conclusion that the supporters were \u201cunlawfully killed\u201d, and the police on duty that day are still to be held fully accountable. It\u2019s the sheer number of highs and lows that marks Liverpool out from other clubs, from these tragedies, to managerial legends Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley, to goal machines Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler and Michael Owen, to the teenage fan Michael Shields, pardoned for a dubious Bulgarian conviction for attempted murder. Manchester United\u2019s stadium is known as the Theatre of Dreams, but this descriptor is better suited to Anfield, which lays claim to the best atmosphere. Liverpool would never, as Arsenal did, have sold their stadium\u2019s name to an airline (the Emirates). And nobody can argue with the emotional impact of club anthem You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone (YNWA). If this season ended in domestic disappointment, there is the potential for a glimmering silver lining. In a European performance as miraculous as Istanbul, we overturned a 3-0 first\u2011leg deficit to Barcelona in the semi-final. We had to win 4-0 to get through. We did win 4-0. We won from perhaps one of the most ingenious corner kicks ever taken, by Trent Alexander-Arnold; mind as sharp as a mathematician. Mo Salah, injured on the sidelines, in a Never Give Up T-shirt, joined the line of players, arm-in-arm, saluting the famous Kop stand at the final whistle. Much of our success this season is down to J\u00fcrgen Klopp, the German manager with the gleaming dental work. Other managers are fined for angrily throwing water bottles down, or screaming at officials; Klopp gets into trouble for running and skipping on to the field in uncontained celebration. He has reinvigorated the club with savvy buys and a joyful offensive style of play that features frequent on-field back-heels and flicks. In his two seasons, he has taken us to three cup finals (we were in the Champions League final last year, losing 3-0 to Real Madrid). The future looks as bright as those teeth of his. Bring on tonight. Bring on the Champions League final. Bring on next season. YNWA.

Well, it turns out the real thousands of people queuing up bringing us to breaking point is the Tory leadership campaign.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been trying to ignore a lot of it, because at the moment the news seems to be an endless cycle of shit <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/29/tory-leadership-rivals-literally-running-for-office-adrian-chiles\">Tory men in shit shorts</a> jogging along spouting their shit opinions, and yes, I\u2019m aware this sentence is turning into a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KgB-sI2H-c\">John Cooper Clarke poem</a>. The battle for PM?

At least this would please Patel, bringing <a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/long-term-international-migration-flows-to-and-from-the-uk/\">net </a><a href=\"https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/long-term-international-migration-flows-to-and-from-the-uk/\">migration</a> down \u2013 something she is very keen on, despite being the child of migrants.</p> <h2>Rory Stewart</h2> <p>I have some serious thoughts about all of you lusting over Lawrence of Belgravia on social media.</p> <p>They are mostly along the lines of: 1) there seem to be a lot of people On The Internet who think Stewart has a chance of becoming leader, which makes me think there are a lot of people who don\u2019t understand the Tory leadership process. And 2) it is dispiriting to see that a guy can throw up a few friendly self-taken videos and not be objectively awful, and then have, in some cases, actual political commentators opining that he would be an excellent prime minister, as though that\u2019s all the rigorous analysis and evidence needed.</p> <p>All this despite the fact that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoryStewartUK/status/1133306786696650752\">one of those videos</a>, taken in Kew Gardens, was quite obviously not a self-taken video, but Stewart waving his stiff, outstretched arm around like someone attempting to flick a light switch with a crutch, to give the impression he was holding a cameraphone. \u201cAre you pretending to hold your phone?\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewchampion/status/1133321127563018243\">asked a BuzzFeed journalist on Twitter</a>. Some hours later, Stewart tweeted his reply: \u201cYes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RoryStewartUK/status/1133306786696650752\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Now - if anyone is around and wants to talk - in Kew Gardens - for the next hour <a href=\"https://t.co/E45A26Y5uR\">pic.twitter.com/E45A26Y5uR</a></p>&mdash; Rory Stewart (@RoryStewartUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RoryStewartUK/status/1133306786696650752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Points for honesty. But no points for introducing such trivial deceit so early in the game which, frankly, does not bode well when it comes to not lying about non-trivial things in the long term. </p> <p>OK, I will concede that he\u2019s the best individual of the bunch. He actually seems to know what he is talking about, though it\u2019s unfortunate that in an analogy about World Trade Organization terms, he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PoliticsJOE_UK/status/1133813666992787456\">managed to compare the UK to a bin</a>.</p> <p>I just worry this will all go to his head. Because even though he seems an affable man, not for a second do I believe this kid hasn\u2019t planned his campaign right down to the fine grain of Afghan sands he keeps talking about. (\u201cIf I was to walk with a dog from New York City to New Jersey, would I become an expert on US politics?\u201d a prominent Afghan businessman archly <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/15/paths-of-glory-ian-parker\">asked in the New Yorker</a>.)</p> <p>Sure, his current Twitter handle might be @RoryStewartUK, but soon he\u2019ll be all @RoryOfficial or @TheREALRoryStewart, and then someone will find a 2006 forum post about how he once used a hedgehog as a means of getting some hair out of a brush and the backlash will begin.</p> <h2>Dominic Raab</h2> <p>A total a-hole. An aa-hole. Raab is the bad boy candidate, the villain archetype of the campaign. Which, for the Tory party, is like saying he\u2019s the bit of yeast in a loaf of bread. There\u2019s been some banter online as to whether Raab is, in fact, a bit fit. And look, we\u2019ve had enough fake news already, so I\u2019ll be honest and say that he is. But he also has a squiggly and prominent temple vein that calls to mind a bird\u2019s eye view of the winding mountain road in a French car advert. And it worries me that it could blow at any point.</p> <p>Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually matter what Raab looks like. In fact, it\u2019s the kind of male objectification that reinforces his belief that there should be no double standards when it comes to sexism or prejudice. Raab says he would not call himself a feminist, which really isn\u2019t a surprise given that he has before called feminists \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/26/dominic-raab-defends-calling-feminists-obnoxious-bigots\">obnoxious bigots</a>\u201d. Except that Raab calling other people obnoxious bigots is the same as when the cat hisses at itself for a long time in front of the hall mirror, isn\u2019t it?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/1133793736729792512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#39;I&#39;m all for working women making the very best of their potential&#39;<br><br>Dominic Raab says he is a &#39;champion of equality and meritocracy&#39; but not a feminist <a href=\"https://t.co/97wVNes3IQ\">https://t.co/97wVNes3IQ</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/L39BfVasSt\">pic.twitter.com/L39BfVasSt</a></p>&mdash; ITV News (@itvnews) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/itvnews/status/1133793736729792512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 29, 2019</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>Esther McVey</h2> <p>Jesus Christ. Let\u2019s start with McVey\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MitchBenn/status/1132582925780815874\">recent utterance</a> on her leadership campaign: \u201cIt takes a very special kind of personality to grow up in Liverpool the same time I did and then join the Conservative party.\u201d</p> <p>I can think of other words for it.</p> <p>McVey\u2019s entire pitch so far seems to consist of throwing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/30/parents-know-best-esther-mcvey-faces-tory-backlash-over-lgbt-lessons\">LGBT+ people and also children under the bus</a>. Her opinion is that parents should be able to pull their kids out of sex and relationship lessons that mention the existence of same-sex families, which, aside from being the opposite of government policy, is quite obviously a gross and discriminatory stance. I will henceforth be calling her McGay just to annoy her.</p> <p>In terms of her political record, McGay has had to apologise to parliament for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/05/esther-mcvey-lies-work-pensions-universal-credit\">lying to it</a>. Challenged about this by a BBC presenter whose job it is to scrutinise those in public office, <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/esther-mcvey-squirms-bbc-breakfast-16351933\">McGay replied</a>:</p> <p>\u201cIf I\u2019ve made one mistake, it was actually coming to the house to apologise because people like you constantly go on about it.\u201d</p> <p>None of this is really a great prelude to becoming prime minister.

Of course some contenders are smarter than others, but we\u2019re talking cigarette papers here.</p> <p>Side note: I recently learned that McGay is a Liverpool FC supporter and I just want to state here, on record, that this is not allowed.</p> <h2>Jeremy Hunt</h2> <p>Jeremy Hunt is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/14/jeremy-hunts-day-job-annoyingly-intrudes-on-leadership-bid\">apparently a bit miffed</a> that his day job as foreign secretary is getting in the way of his leadership press (though he was sure to get in early interviews with the <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-hunt-tories-must-show-were-not-all-about-money-a4103051.html\">Evening Standard</a> and <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/04/jeremy-hunt-last-cameroon\">New Statesman</a>).</p> <p>So to help out a little, Jeremy Hunt: here are your best bits!

It\u2019s the kind of outlandish thinking that will set her apart and lead(som) her to success. True, it\u2019s only a matter of time before her fellow Brexiteers realise she is the twin of Jean-Claude Juncker and secretly working against them, but she might just get away with it.</p> <p>I cannot believe I\u2019m saying this, but Leadsom wouldn\u2019t, given the absolute state of everything, be the worst pick.

      "bodyText": "Remember Nigel Farage\u2019s infamous racist poster? Well, it turns out the real thousands of people queuing up bringing us to breaking point is the Tory leadership campaign. I\u2019ve been trying to ignore a lot of it, because at the moment the news seems to be an endless cycle of shit Tory men in shit shorts jogging along spouting their shit opinions, and yes, I\u2019m aware this sentence is turning into a John Cooper Clarke poem. The battle for PM? EVIDENTLY CHICKENSHIT. Earlier this week, the Guardian published a story about moles which included the detail: \u201cMoles eat their body weight in worms every 12 hours.\u201d And honestly, that would be preferable. But let\u2019s break it down so far, before Priti Patel enters the race, at which point I will be leaving the country and never returning. At least this would please Patel, bringing net migration down \u2013 something she is very keen on, despite being the child of migrants. Rory Stewart I have some serious thoughts about all of you lusting over Lawrence of Belgravia on social media. They are mostly along the lines of: 1) there seem to be a lot of people On The Internet who think Stewart has a chance of becoming leader, which makes me think there are a lot of people who don\u2019t understand the Tory leadership process. And 2) it is dispiriting to see that a guy can throw up a few friendly self-taken videos and not be objectively awful, and then have, in some cases, actual political commentators opining that he would be an excellent prime minister, as though that\u2019s all the rigorous analysis and evidence needed. All this despite the fact that one of those videos, taken in Kew Gardens, was quite obviously not a self-taken video, but Stewart waving his stiff, outstretched arm around like someone attempting to flick a light switch with a crutch, to give the impression he was holding a cameraphone. \u201cAre you pretending to hold your phone?\u201d asked a BuzzFeed journalist on Twitter. Some hours later, Stewart tweeted his reply: \u201cYes.\u201d Points for honesty. But no points for introducing such trivial deceit so early in the game which, frankly, does not bode well when it comes to not lying about non-trivial things in the long term. OK, I will concede that he\u2019s the best individual of the bunch. He actually seems to know what he is talking about, though it\u2019s unfortunate that in an analogy about World Trade Organization terms, he managed to compare the UK to a bin. I just worry this will all go to his head. Because even though he seems an affable man, not for a second do I believe this kid hasn\u2019t planned his campaign right down to the fine grain of Afghan sands he keeps talking about. (\u201cIf I was to walk with a dog from New York City to New Jersey, would I become an expert on US politics?\u201d a prominent Afghan businessman archly asked in the New Yorker.) Sure, his current Twitter handle might be @RoryStewartUK, but soon he\u2019ll be all @RoryOfficial or @TheREALRoryStewart, and then someone will find a 2006 forum post about how he once used a hedgehog as a means of getting some hair out of a brush and the backlash will begin. Dominic Raab A total a-hole. An aa-hole. Raab is the bad boy candidate, the villain archetype of the campaign. Which, for the Tory party, is like saying he\u2019s the bit of yeast in a loaf of bread. There\u2019s been some banter online as to whether Raab is, in fact, a bit fit. And look, we\u2019ve had enough fake news already, so I\u2019ll be honest and say that he is. But he also has a squiggly and prominent temple vein that calls to mind a bird\u2019s eye view of the winding mountain road in a French car advert. And it worries me that it could blow at any point. Of course, it doesn\u2019t actually matter what Raab looks like. In fact, it\u2019s the kind of male objectification that reinforces his belief that there should be no double standards when it comes to sexism or prejudice. Raab says he would not call himself a feminist, which really isn\u2019t a surprise given that he has before called feminists \u201cobnoxious bigots\u201d. Except that Raab calling other people obnoxious bigots is the same as when the cat hisses at itself for a long time in front of the hall mirror, isn\u2019t it? Esther McVey Jesus Christ. Let\u2019s start with McVey\u2019s recent utterance on her leadership campaign: \u201cIt takes a very special kind of personality to grow up in Liverpool the same time I did and then join the Conservative party.\u201d I can think of other words for it. McVey\u2019s entire pitch so far seems to consist of throwing LGBT+ people and also children under the bus. Her opinion is that parents should be able to pull their kids out of sex and relationship lessons that mention the existence of same-sex families, which, aside from being the opposite of government policy, is quite obviously a gross and discriminatory stance. I will henceforth be calling her McGay just to annoy her. In terms of her political record, McGay has had to apologise to parliament for lying to it. Challenged about this by a BBC presenter whose job it is to scrutinise those in public office, McGay replied: \u201cIf I\u2019ve made one mistake, it was actually coming to the house to apologise because people like you constantly go on about it.\u201d None of this is really a great prelude to becoming prime minister. But who even cares any more? McGay, who once lost her seat before being reelected in a different constituency, has also said she would endeavour to take hundreds of thousands of people off disability payments because \u201cbodies heal\u201d. Remember as a kid, when you used to watch the television or listen to the radio or whatever and think of all those clever people running the country? And then you hit adulthood and you think, wow, look at these people running the country \u2013 or imagining themselves capable of doing so \u2013 and they are, how to phrase this, just outrageously thick? Of course some contenders are smarter than others, but we\u2019re talking cigarette papers here. Side note: I recently learned that McGay is a Liverpool FC supporter and I just want to state here, on record, that this is not allowed. Jeremy Hunt Jeremy Hunt is apparently a bit miffed that his day job as foreign secretary is getting in the way of his leadership press (though he was sure to get in early interviews with the Evening Standard and New Statesman). So to help out a little, Jeremy Hunt: here are your best bits! That time Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, and worth millions, claimed 24p in expenses for travelling half a mile. That time Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, almost decapitated someone while ringing a bell. Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, calling his Chinese wife Japanese. Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, with the great habit of standing in front of things in a bad way, like a whiteboard containing confidential NHS patient information, or in front of the letter \u201co\u201d in a sign saying \u201ccountry\u201d, beautifully cropped. Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, being delivered an 8ft replica of a textbook titled How to Read a Paper: The Basics of Evidence Based Medicine, after continuously misrepresenting medical data as health secretary. Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, being presented with a giant gold phallus for winning Dick of the Year award. Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, pulling the emergency stop cord in a train loo instead of flushing. Jeremy Hunt, potential prime minister, being followed by a sousaphone player (twice) to outline the fact his modus operandi is apparently just gaffes. It\u2019s true that Hunt is one of the more intelligent in the line-up. But with this track record, we can\u2019t be sure his whole premiership wouldn\u2019t be the equivalent of pulling a push door for four solid years. Matt Hancock Hancock\u2019s most prominent bit of leadership-bid PR to date is a Newsnight interview, in which he said he should be leader because \u201cI just think we need a fresh face\u201d, which is actually a pitch for his rival, Mark Harper. Who? Exactly. The interview also included this beautiful exchange, courtesy of Emma Barnett. Hancock: \u201cThe best option is to leave the European Union with a deal. I\u2019ve been absolutely clear about that.\u201d Barnett: \u201cWhy then, this morning, on television, in another interview, did you say that if Boris Johnson was prime minister \u2026 and he took us out without a deal, that you would support it?\u201d Hancock\u2019s other intervention has been an interview he gave to the Financial Times+ in which, referring to Johnson\u2019s \u201cfuck business\u201d comments, he said: \u201cTo those who say, \u2018fuck business\u2019, I say \u201cfuck \u2018fuck business\u2019\u201d. I just don\u2019t think saying \u201cfuck fuck\u201d sounds that cool. Speaking of which, we need to address the outfit Hancock wore earlier this week, in public, which should rule out anybody running for the highest office. James Cleverly Anyone with even a passing nod to intelligence has already pointed out that this surname, and being the MP for Braintree, is rather amusing re the fact that Cleverly comes across as not even not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but basically a spoon. Cleverly\u2019s sole campaign action so far seems to be making a video to mock Stewart\u2019s selfiegate, but given that I\u2019m about to link to the Daily Express as the sole source to have picked this up, you can see the level of cut-through that managed. As I said, spoon. Sajid Javid I really wish I knew what Sajid Javid\u2019s dad used to do for a living. I just think we need to know. I don\u2019t think he can be prime minister without keeping this secret any longer. Why is he so reticent about this? I\u2019m so sick of him not mentioning it. Jesse Norman (yet to announce) Swipe left. Kit Malthouse As above. Andrea Leadsom The finest bit of investigative journalism I ever did was when I unearthed that Leadsom had made a Twitter list titled \u201cAndrea Leadsom\u201d that consisted of a single account: her own. It\u2019s the kind of outlandish thinking that will set her apart and lead(som) her to success. True, it\u2019s only a matter of time before her fellow Brexiteers realise she is the twin of Jean-Claude Juncker and secretly working against them, but she might just get away with it. I cannot believe I\u2019m saying this, but Leadsom wouldn\u2019t, given the absolute state of everything, be the worst pick. But this is mostly because I\u2019ve been obsessed with her snide ongoing battle with John Bercow and I live for the messy drama. Mark Harper Steve Baker Steve Baker hasn\u2019t even formally announced his candidacy yet, but there he is posting extremely cringe videos on Instagram. The best of these saw Baker wearing a jumpsuit and harness and went, verbatim, thus: \u201cI just want to say an absolutely huge thank you to everyone who voted for me on the ConservativeHome survey, putting me fourth in the leadership contest. Obviously that\u2019s a very serious thing \u2026 I\u2019ll have to mull it over. \u201cI\u2019ll have a big meeting tomorrow with some senior colleagues to discuss what I should do. But in the meantime, I\u2019m at a drop zone where I\u2019m going to be going sky diving.\u201d Michael Gove A key weapon in Gove\u2019s arsenal is his extremely cute dog, bichon frise Snowy, who occasionally appears peeping around the Gove household door. A bit like how, before Zac Goldsmith revealed himself to be a massive racist, one could appreciate his adorable miniature dachshund, Otto, who would trot alongside him as he leafleted. Snowy actually once came second in a Westminster Dogs of the Year competition, which is a thing. I won\u2019t pretend I don\u2019t have a lot of respect for the decision of the MPs who entered their pooches into this competition, because I do. I have nothing else to say on Gove except that he is merely the Macbeth to Sarah Vine\u2019s Lady Macbeth. Boris Johnson I have so little respect for this man that it\u2019s verging on a hate crime. I actually don\u2019t even want to spend time on this human whoopee cushion, who will almost certainly end up our prime minister, on the say-so of a vastly unrepresentative Tory selectorate. But sure, it\u2019s the idea of a second referendum that\u2019s undermining our democracy. Penny Mordaunt Penny Mordaunt is yet to announce, but reportedly will do so shortly. This is the main thing I think about when I think about Penny Mourdant: You are now up to speed. I am off to eat my body weight in worms. \u2022 Hannah Jane Parkinson is a Guardian columnist",

Rather than whisking us from one prominent philosophical peak to another, it spends a lot of time wandering the fertile valleys between them. We learn about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/feb/14/rene-descartes-poisoned-catholic-priest\" title=\"\">Descartes</a>, but also about 17th-century scientists who still believed in magic. Even Falstaff is roped in to the story: there\u2019s a Socratic touch to the way he imparts wisdom by playing the fool, and when he dies his body gradually freezes from the feet up, as Socrates\u2019s did when he drank the hemlock.</p> <p>The story R\u00e9e has to tell, from Shakespeare to the 20th century, is broadly chronological. It ends with a portrait of the spiritually tormented Ludwig Wittgenstein, who started off as one of the richest young men in Europe and ended up wearing trousers so tattered he had difficulty getting past a hotel doorman. Yet the book is far from a unified narrative. Borrowing from modernist literary techniques, R\u00e9e slices into British intellectual history at 50-year intervals from 1601 to 1951, while cheerfully admitting that these dates are pretty arbitrary. What we have, then, is less a lineage of Great Men than a series of cross-sections. We move through a set of landscapes rather than leap from one solitary figure to another. The book maps the way in which the different conceptual currents of a period intermingle, so that one of the finest literary critics ever to write in English, William Hazlitt, sits cheek-by-jowl with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/11/edmund-burke-hero-david-marquand\" title=\"\">Edmund Burke</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/26/sexual-irregularities-morality-jeremy-bentham-review\" title=\"\">Jeremy Bentham</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/dec/03/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">William Godwin</a>. David Hume rubs shoulders with the 18th-century Ulsterman Francis Hutcheson, who championed the rights of women, children, servants, slaves and animals. He even put in a good word for aliens.</p> <p>The history of philosophy usually tells us how one set of ideas gave birth to another. What it tends to overlook are the political forces and social upheavals that shaped them. <em>Witcraft</em>, by contrast, sees philosophy itself as a historical practice. For much of its career, it was never easy to distinguish from political conflict, religious strife and scientific controversy. For some 17th-century Puritans, philosophy was a satanic pursuit, an impious meddling with sacred truths. There was a battle between the church and the universities on the one hand, with their reverence for Aristotle and the schoolmen, and on the other the humanists, scientists, atheists and radicals. It is the stuffy old university of Wittenberg versus the humanistic Hamlet and his sceptical friend Horatio.</p> <p>R\u00e9e is too subtle a thinker to reduce this quarrel to Reason versus Superstition, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/acgrayling\" title=\"\">AC Grayling</a> has no such qualms. His <em>The History of Philosophy</em> (note the authoritative \u201cThe\u201d) sees no dark side to the cult of Reason. And if reason can do little wrong, religion can do nothing right. Whereas R\u00e9e shows how religion and political radicalism can strike up fruitful alliances, the briskly rationalist Grayling refuses the title of philosophy to any view of the world that involves religious faith. One wonders how Plato and Bishop Berkeley managed to slip into these pages.</p> <p>Grayling has a high regard for philosophy but does not seem to find it much fun, while R\u00e9e finds it a lot of fun but doesn\u2019t rate it all that highly. Philosophers, he believes, have contributed little to the progress of knowledge. Instead, they go round in circles and are constantly at each other\u2019s throats. Their ideas are then summarised in guides that force their readers to \u201crush through the canon like tourists on a tight schedule\u201d. It isn\u2019t a bad description of Grayling\u2019s book, in which depth is sacrificed to breadth. Rousseau changed the sensibility of Europe, but gets only five pages. Karl Marx is awarded a couple more, but is accused of being a utopian thinker. In fact, Marx had hardly anything to say about the future, which is something of a handicap for a utopian visionary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>The difference between them is clear from their writing.

A section of his book on modern European thinkers commits some elementary blunders, but this doesn\u2019t matter much because these writers aren\u2019t really philosophers anyway. When it comes to affairs of the mind, Grayling is determined to have as little truck as possible with fancypants foreigners, unless like Kant and Hegel they have been dead for a decent amount of time.

The eminent Jewish thinker Emmanuel Levinas takes religion seriously, which clearly disqualifies him from being a philosopher; but Grayling, still in blurbish mode, is gracious enough to describe him as \u201can attractive figure whose ethical concerns exerted a life-transforming influence on some\u201d.

      "body": "<p>There are no flowers any more and no remembrance plaque but David Mendes da Silva and Giliano Wijnaldum, the younger brother of the Liverpool midfielder Georginio, know exactly where to stop to point out the spot where Anthony Fernandes was killed. Fernandes was one of Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s best friends, but on 4 May 2012 his life ended on the Westkousdijk, his body riddled with bullets after a drugs-related dispute.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/nov/25/georginio-wijnaldum-interview-liverpool-klopp-newcastle-holland\">Georginio Wijnaldum: \u2018Klopp was interested in my personal life and that was good for me\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Fernandes\u2019s life could have been so different. He was, like Georginio Wijnaldum, an outstanding young footballer and could have made it professionally. Instead, his focus on football gradually disappeared and he ended up in the wrong crowd. He got involved in drugs and it ended in the worst possible way.</p> <p>After the killing, the entire neighbourhood mourned, including David, Giliano and Georginio. That weekend, when Wijnaldum scored for PSV Eindhoven he took off his shirt and revealed a T-shirt in honour of Fernandes: \u201cRest in peace Anthony. Schiemond passion\u201d.</p> <p>Schiemond is the neighbourhood where the Wijnaldum brothers, Mendes da Silva (who lived next door) and Fernandes grew up. In 2008, it was ranked as the \u201cmost child-unfriendly area\u201d in the Netherlands based on juvenile delinquency, youth unemployment, teenage mothers, disadvantaged pupils, child abuse and children in poverty.</p> <p>There are 12 rows of council estates stacked on top of each other here, near the Maas River, and it has never been the same since a prostitution zone was opened on the adjacent street, Keileweg, in 1995.</p> <p>Georginio Wijnaldum was five years old at the time and had just moved in with his grandmother in a small flat. His mother had moved to Amsterdam but \u201cGini\u201d wanted to stay in the multicultural Schiemond. His friends lived here and he knew his way around. As Giliano, two years his junior and a professional footballer at Sparta Rotterdam, explains: \u201cSchiemond is togetherness and excitement. Schiemond is passion. Schiemond is football.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0f5f9ef0b0155111c843317b33d7e369931cb197\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f5f9ef0b0155111c843317b33d7e369931cb197/0_0_3360_4923/683.jpg\" alt=\"The spot where Anthony Fernandes was shot dead in 2012.\" width=\"683\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The spot where Anthony Fernandes was shot dead in 2012.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Giliano and Mendes da Silva are walking around an area full of dilapidated brick flats with satellite dishes and ornamental birds on the brown, iron-cast balconies. On the streets there is broken glass, broken bits of plastic and broken bikes. Still, Giliano says: \u201cIt was much worse when we grew up here.\u201d Mendes da Silva, who played seven times for the Netherlands and is now a player\u2019s agent, adds: \u201cIf you survive here, you\u2019ll survive everywhere.\u201d</p> <p>Both are wearing tracksuits made by Clan de Banlieue, a brand set up by an old classmate of Giliano\u2019s. \u201cSo we have to support that,\u201d they say. Solidarity is extremely important for people from Schiemond. As is football. When the boys grew up all they did was play football. On the grass, in the streets, between the flats<strong> </strong>and on the only football square (made of asphalt) there was.</p> <p>They even played in the cellars under the houses that used to be easy to enter. It is also where they hid from the police if they had been up to no good, Mendes da Silva says. \u201cIn the cellars there were prostitutes and their clients, there were dealers and pimps. Needles and condoms was everywhere, sometimes a gun. You told the young kids to stay away from the needles because they could make you sick.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes a boy would walk in with a bullet wound because he had been playing around with a gun. Often you could hear shots being fired, whether that was a settlement among drug criminals or a marital dispute getting out of hand.</p> <p>For some neighbours a football ending up in their garden was enough to wave a gun. Mendes da Silva says: \u201cFirst you ran away, on the walkway outside the flats and on to the roof, but you came back quickly with all your friends because you were too curious and wanted to know what had happened. Then the police came and we were all taken to the station. It didn\u2019t matter if you were only 11 years old.\u201d</p> <p>Giliano points to the flat where his grandmother Francien still lives. There are two small silver trophies in front of the white blinds. He or his older brother must have won them at youth tournaments, he suspects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d0119ecb940285165d45fa9ec85d86583906f21\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d0119ecb940285165d45fa9ec85d86583906f21/0_0_4250_2836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates after the final whistle of Liverpool\u2019s Champions League win over Barcelona.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georginio Wijnaldum celebrates after the final whistle of Liverpool\u2019s Champions League win over Barcelona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Iain Watts/Mercury Press Media/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>People who have lived in Schiemond are often very fond of it. \u201cIt really is a fertile ground [where people can develop],\u201d Mendes da Silva says. \u201cA lot of footballers come from these streets, but also DJs and rappers. I know a lawyer and a doctor and some businessmen who grew up here. All the best players in Rotterdam came to Schiemond and it was here the fiercest football games took place. Boys, even the smallest, became tough men here.\u201d</p> <p>The Wijnaldum brothers were called the \u201cmooiboys\u201d (the handsome boys) because of their handsome smile and cheerful character. \u201cThey were the sweethearts of Schiemond,\u201d Mendes da Silva says.</p> <p>Before he was taken to Sparta Rotterdam Georginio wanted to be a gymnast. He had been inspired by a girl at school who did the most amazing moves and Mendes da Silva was not surprised that Wijnaldum scored with a powerful header after an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/07/liverpool-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg-match-report\" title=\"\">impressive leap against Barcelona</a>. \u201cHe was often making somersaults and such,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you see that he actually jumped <em>too</em> high when he scored that header against Barcelona?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the cellars there were prostitutes and their clients, there were dealers and pimps</p> <footer> <cite>David Mendes da Silva</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut he was still able to correct himself and make his head connect with the ball. And his body \u2013 and his way of moving on the pitch \u2013 is formed here in Schiemond. He was jumping for fun when he was a kid but he also had the street football. It gives you so much. You have to keep your balance slaloming between opponents, pieces of glass and old needles.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cmooiboys\u201d often went to Sparta on foot, with their grandmother, Francien, always accompanying them. \u201cIt was a 45-minute walk, but she never let me go alone,\u201d Georginio has said.</p> <p>Francien, in fact, was keen for him to play football rather than gymnastics. \u201cShe thought making somersaults was too dangerous and that I would break my back doing that.</p> <p>\u201cFootball was safer. She wasn\u2019t thinking that I would grew up to become a professional footballer \u2013 it was more to keep me away from all the crazy things on the streets.\u201d</p> <p>He has always stayed close to his grandmother and she was there when he signed new contracts and when he played in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df3fab5451eaa9f2982b5be5f188c1980f56a877\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df3fab5451eaa9f2982b5be5f188c1980f56a877/0_0_4950_2971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Giliano Wijnaldum, left, and David Mendes da Silva walk through Schiemond, where they and Gini Wijnaldum grew up.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giliano Wijnaldum, left, and David Mendes da Silva walk through Schiemond, where they and Gini Wijnaldum grew up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judith Jockel/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As we walk across the old football square next to the River Maas and with the netless goals, Giliano says: \u201cIf I could do it again, I would still want to grow up here.\u201d Mendes da Silva adds: \u201cDefinitely. But I wouldn\u2019t let my children grow up here. No way. Even though Schiemond is a lot safer now, since the prostitution zone has been closed.\u201d</p> <p>They laugh when they talk about the moment Georginio came on for Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. \u201cGini was angry, I could tell,\u201d Mendes da Silva says. \u201cHe does not want to be on the bench on the big occasions and if he is a fire lights up in him.

      "bodyText": "There are no flowers any more and no remembrance plaque but David Mendes da Silva and Giliano Wijnaldum, the younger brother of the Liverpool midfielder Georginio, know exactly where to stop to point out the spot where Anthony Fernandes was killed. Fernandes was one of Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s best friends, but on 4 May 2012 his life ended on the Westkousdijk, his body riddled with bullets after a drugs-related dispute. Fernandes\u2019s life could have been so different. He was, like Georginio Wijnaldum, an outstanding young footballer and could have made it professionally. Instead, his focus on football gradually disappeared and he ended up in the wrong crowd. He got involved in drugs and it ended in the worst possible way. After the killing, the entire neighbourhood mourned, including David, Giliano and Georginio. That weekend, when Wijnaldum scored for PSV Eindhoven he took off his shirt and revealed a T-shirt in honour of Fernandes: \u201cRest in peace Anthony. Schiemond passion\u201d. Schiemond is the neighbourhood where the Wijnaldum brothers, Mendes da Silva (who lived next door) and Fernandes grew up. In 2008, it was ranked as the \u201cmost child-unfriendly area\u201d in the Netherlands based on juvenile delinquency, youth unemployment, teenage mothers, disadvantaged pupils, child abuse and children in poverty. There are 12 rows of council estates stacked on top of each other here, near the Maas River, and it has never been the same since a prostitution zone was opened on the adjacent street, Keileweg, in 1995. Georginio Wijnaldum was five years old at the time and had just moved in with his grandmother in a small flat. His mother had moved to Amsterdam but \u201cGini\u201d wanted to stay in the multicultural Schiemond. His friends lived here and he knew his way around. As Giliano, two years his junior and a professional footballer at Sparta Rotterdam, explains: \u201cSchiemond is togetherness and excitement. Schiemond is passion. Schiemond is football.\u201d Giliano and Mendes da Silva are walking around an area full of dilapidated brick flats with satellite dishes and ornamental birds on the brown, iron-cast balconies. On the streets there is broken glass, broken bits of plastic and broken bikes. Still, Giliano says: \u201cIt was much worse when we grew up here.\u201d Mendes da Silva, who played seven times for the Netherlands and is now a player\u2019s agent, adds: \u201cIf you survive here, you\u2019ll survive everywhere.\u201d Both are wearing tracksuits made by Clan de Banlieue, a brand set up by an old classmate of Giliano\u2019s. \u201cSo we have to support that,\u201d they say. Solidarity is extremely important for people from Schiemond. As is football. When the boys grew up all they did was play football. On the grass, in the streets, between the flats and on the only football square (made of asphalt) there was. They even played in the cellars under the houses that used to be easy to enter. It is also where they hid from the police if they had been up to no good, Mendes da Silva says. \u201cIn the cellars there were prostitutes and their clients, there were dealers and pimps. Needles and condoms was everywhere, sometimes a gun. You told the young kids to stay away from the needles because they could make you sick.\u201d Sometimes a boy would walk in with a bullet wound because he had been playing around with a gun. Often you could hear shots being fired, whether that was a settlement among drug criminals or a marital dispute getting out of hand. For some neighbours a football ending up in their garden was enough to wave a gun. Mendes da Silva says: \u201cFirst you ran away, on the walkway outside the flats and on to the roof, but you came back quickly with all your friends because you were too curious and wanted to know what had happened. Then the police came and we were all taken to the station. It didn\u2019t matter if you were only 11 years old.\u201d Giliano points to the flat where his grandmother Francien still lives. There are two small silver trophies in front of the white blinds. He or his older brother must have won them at youth tournaments, he suspects. People who have lived in Schiemond are often very fond of it. \u201cIt really is a fertile ground [where people can develop],\u201d Mendes da Silva says. \u201cA lot of footballers come from these streets, but also DJs and rappers. I know a lawyer and a doctor and some businessmen who grew up here. All the best players in Rotterdam came to Schiemond and it was here the fiercest football games took place. Boys, even the smallest, became tough men here.\u201d The Wijnaldum brothers were called the \u201cmooiboys\u201d (the handsome boys) because of their handsome smile and cheerful character. \u201cThey were the sweethearts of Schiemond,\u201d Mendes da Silva says. Before he was taken to Sparta Rotterdam Georginio wanted to be a gymnast. He had been inspired by a girl at school who did the most amazing moves and Mendes da Silva was not surprised that Wijnaldum scored with a powerful header after an impressive leap against Barcelona. \u201cHe was often making somersaults and such,\u201d he says. \u201cDid you see that he actually jumped too high when he scored that header against Barcelona? \u201cBut he was still able to correct himself and make his head connect with the ball. And his body \u2013 and his way of moving on the pitch \u2013 is formed here in Schiemond. He was jumping for fun when he was a kid but he also had the street football. It gives you so much. You have to keep your balance slaloming between opponents, pieces of glass and old needles.\u201d The \u201cmooiboys\u201d often went to Sparta on foot, with their grandmother, Francien, always accompanying them. \u201cIt was a 45-minute walk, but she never let me go alone,\u201d Georginio has said. Francien, in fact, was keen for him to play football rather than gymnastics. \u201cShe thought making somersaults was too dangerous and that I would break my back doing that. \u201cFootball was safer. She wasn\u2019t thinking that I would grew up to become a professional footballer \u2013 it was more to keep me away from all the crazy things on the streets.\u201d He has always stayed close to his grandmother and she was there when he signed new contracts and when he played in the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. As we walk across the old football square next to the River Maas and with the netless goals, Giliano says: \u201cIf I could do it again, I would still want to grow up here.\u201d Mendes da Silva adds: \u201cDefinitely. But I wouldn\u2019t let my children grow up here. No way. Even though Schiemond is a lot safer now, since the prostitution zone has been closed.\u201d They laugh when they talk about the moment Georginio came on for Liverpool in the Champions League semi-final against Barcelona. \u201cGini was angry, I could tell,\u201d Mendes da Silva says. \u201cHe does not want to be on the bench on the big occasions and if he is a fire lights up in him. Just like in the old days when you had to wait for hours to come on again if you lost on this square. You have to stand up for yourself and don\u2019t get pushed around.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>As a recently divorced single mum, the past few years have been a bit of a struggle financially. Occasionally I\u2019ve had to borrow money from my family. My car was completely written off in February, so I had to take out a bank loan for a new one. The lowest point was when I was newly separated and had to ask my mum to come to the supermarket to pay for food.</p> <p>The reason money was tight was due to not being able to really draw much of a salary from my business, <a href=\"https://cocoalibre.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Cocoa Libre</a>, a dairy-, nut- and gluten-free vegan chocolate brand that I started in 2014 after my youngest son started to develop an intolerance to dairy and would constantly have a poorly tummy.</p> <p>Back then, it was really difficult to find tasty treats he could eat. At the time I was freelancing as a graphic designer and I started thinking about setting up my own confectionery business aimed at people with intolerances. I took a chocolate-making course, equipped out the back room in my old house with a bain-marie, and started experimenting. I dreamt up the brand, started networking and met a buyer from Holland &amp; Barrett at a trade show, who later placed an order for 18,000 units of 3D chocolate penguins. I couldn\u2019t believe it!</p> <p>When my then husband and I divorced last year, I was only drawing a \u00a39,000-a-year salary. It was tough. Last summer I was ready to quit the business and find a more secure job.

      "bodyText": "As a recently divorced single mum, the past few years have been a bit of a struggle financially. Occasionally I\u2019ve had to borrow money from my family. My car was completely written off in February, so I had to take out a bank loan for a new one. The lowest point was when I was newly separated and had to ask my mum to come to the supermarket to pay for food. The reason money was tight was due to not being able to really draw much of a salary from my business, Cocoa Libre, a dairy-, nut- and gluten-free vegan chocolate brand that I started in 2014 after my youngest son started to develop an intolerance to dairy and would constantly have a poorly tummy. Back then, it was really difficult to find tasty treats he could eat. At the time I was freelancing as a graphic designer and I started thinking about setting up my own confectionery business aimed at people with intolerances. I took a chocolate-making course, equipped out the back room in my old house with a bain-marie, and started experimenting. I dreamt up the brand, started networking and met a buyer from Holland &amp; Barrett at a trade show, who later placed an order for 18,000 units of 3D chocolate penguins. I couldn\u2019t believe it! When my then husband and I divorced last year, I was only drawing a \u00a39,000-a-year salary. It was tough. Last summer I was ready to quit the business and find a more secure job. When I confided in a member of staff that I didn\u2019t think I could financially carry on with the company, she told her father, a businessman, who saw its potential and came on board as an investor. I had lots of big orders pending so it was a huge relief. Knowing that I was having financial difficulties, such as putting my council tax on my credit card, earlier this year my investor suggested extending my salary to about \u00a335,000. Now that I\u2019m free to focus on the things I\u2019m best at, such as new product development, sales and marketing, it\u2019s taken the pressure off my home life. I can do more with my boys, who are 10 and eight, and stop worrying so much about bills and really enjoy my independence. Last year I bought a three-bedroom house using some equity from our former home; my mum acted as the guarantor. My mortgage is \u00a3752 a month. I spend about \u00a3300 a month on groceries.

The proportion of female MEPs has increased slightly from 36% five years ago to about 39%, or 286 out of 751 seats, with nearly all of the official results confirmed. The gender balance will be above the 30.2% average of the EU\u2019s national parliaments. Eleven member states enforced gender quotas on parties in the 2019 elections, up from eight in 2014. The balance is superior to that of the House of Commons in London, where 32% of MPs are women and the US House of Representatives, where 23.6% are female. The result nevertheless leaves the European parliament languishing behind 16 parliaments around the world in terms of female representation. Six of the 28 member states are returning a broadly gender-balanced group of MEPs to the parliament: Sweden (55%), Finland (54%), France (50%), Slovenia (50%), Luxembourg (50%) and the UK (47%), up from 41% in 2014.

It is one of the UK\u2019s largest petrol retailers, serving about 800,000 customers every day through a network of 1,100 Esso-branded filling stations. David Chilton, the global loyalty programmes manager at ExxonMobil, said: \u201cOur customers are our number one priority, so we\u2019re very excited to be launching the Esso Nectar partnership.\u201d However, in the US the company has been investigated over allegations that it knew about the dangers of global heating for decades but deceived the public over the risks. The firm has rejected the charge. Its alleged role in spreading misinformation about the climate crisis is being investigated by the European Union. James Moir, the managing director of Nectar Loyalty, said: \u201cWe\u2019re always looking for new ways to reward our customers and are thrilled to be offering them the chance to turn their fuel into money off their weekly shop, as well as hundreds of other personalised rewards.\u201d In a raft of other changes in the sector, BP will shortly launch a new loyalty programme for its UK retail business, a network of more than 300 filling stations in the UK and 900 more BP-branded forecourts owned and run by independent dealers. The Shell Drivers\u2019 Club offered cash discounts on fuel or Avios points or Waitrose vouchers. But as of this month, it has launched a new customer loyalty card, Shell Go+, which no longer allows its members to direct their points value towards carbon offset schemes. The two major surviving schemes are Morrisons More and Texaco. \u201cThere is a huge shift under way in petrol station loyalty and by the summer the whole landscape will have been changed,\u201d said Anika Newjoto, editor of supermarket rewards website Shopper Points. \u201cThis seems to be happening because, frankly, the schemes were not working. Petrol is a very low profit margin business and it seems that the cost of the loyalty points was not proving worthwhile.\u201d",

Prof Chris Exley angered health experts for claiming that tiny amounts of aluminium in inactivated vaccines, such as the HPV and whooping cough inoculations, may cause \u201cthe more severe and disabling form of autism\u201d. In 2017, the professor of bioinorganic chemistry published a paper on aluminium found in the brain tissue of five autistic patients that has been shared tens of thousands of times by vaccine skeptics online \u2013 despite criticism from health experts over its lack of controls and small sample size.

But gay rights advocates are forced to devote much of their energy to stopping lawmakers from passing new anti-LGBT bills. One group, Equality Texas, said its lobbying <a href=\"https://www.equalitytexas.org/for-immediate-release-equality-texas-blocked-nearly-20-anti-lgbtq-bill-this-session/\">helped kill 19 bills</a> in this year\u2019s session.</p> <p>The Texas Republican party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.texasgop.org/platform/\">platform</a> stated until 2014 that \u201cthe practice of homosexuality tears at the fabric of society and contributes to the breakdown of the family unit\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The Texas legislature has ended another busy session, sending bills to the governor that would ban red-light traffic cameras, end regulation of the plumbing industry, make it easier to dine outdoors with a dog, carry brass knuckles, and possess a gun inside a rented apartment and a place of worship. But as usual, politicians did not manage to repeal a homophobic law that has been unenforceable since 2003, meaning that a ban on \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d remains part of the Texas penal code. This states that it is a Class C misdemeanor offense, punishable with up to a $500 fine, if a person \u201cengages in deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex\u201d. It is 16 years since the US supreme court struck down Texas\u2019s anti-sodomy law. The case, Lawrence v Texas, arose after sheriff\u2019s deputies charged two men with a misdemeanor for having sex in a Houston-area apartment in 1998. Yet Texas\u2019s biennial legislature recently concluded its 2019 session without passing any of seven Democrat-led bills that would have excised the \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d prohibition, which was enacted in 1973. It would not be complex or time-consuming to strike out a brief section from the code, and Democrats have tried at every regular session since the supreme court ruling. None of this year\u2019s bills made it beyond the committee stage. Attempts to update the Texas Family Code to comply with the 2015 supreme court decision that legalised same-sex marriage nationwide also went nowhere. The code insists, in language introduced in 2003: \u201cA marriage between persons of the same sex or a civil union is contrary to the public policy of this state and is void in this state.\u201d Texas is \u201cby definition an anti-homosexual state\u201d, said Garnet Coleman, a Democratic state representative from Harris county who has filed a bill to repeal the \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d ban in each of the past eight regular sessions. Another of his proposals, to simplify the process of gender changes on official documents, was also spurned this year. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a given,\u201d he said. \u201cThe anti-LGBTQ sentiments in the Republican party are so strong that even an evidence-based circumstance can\u2019t be voted for.\u201d Republicans on the Texas house criminal jurisprudence committee did not respond to requests for comment. The 2003 ruling invalidated similar bans in other states, but Texas is not alone in its reticence to delete unconstitutional laws. Utah repealed its bar of sodomy (and adultery) in March, joining Montana and Virginia, which repealed laws in 2013 and 2014 respectively. But anti-sodomy laws technically remain in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma and South Carolina, as well as Texas. Some mention anal or oral sex in the same breath as bestiality, such as Michigan, where the penal code declares: \u201cAny person who shall commit the abominable and detestable crime against nature either with mankind or with any animal shall be guilty of a felony.\u201d According to Louisiana law, the attorney general has the power to institute civil proceedings against businesses that engage in \u201cunlawful activity aimed at organized homosexuality\u201d. The law cites homosexuality in the same sentence as prostitution, narcotics, extortion and embezzlement. Critics of the laws argue they are not merely archaic and irrelevant quirks but reflections of current discriminatory attitudes that send a hostile message to LGBT people and occasionally have a direct impact. A police officer in El Paso, for example, threatened to arrest a group of gay men for violating Texas\u2019s homosexual conduct law after two kissed in a restaurant in 2009. An investigation by the Advocate in 2013 found that a sheriff\u2019s office in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, had arrested at least a dozen gay men using an invalid sodomy law. That prompted an apology from the sheriff, but two men having sex in a car were arrested for \u201ccrimes against nature\u201d in the same city in 2015. Florida\u2019s prohibition of \u201cunnatural and lascivious acts\u201d has led to gay men being arrested for consensual sexual activity. And outmoded American statutes were cited by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to defend his own country\u2019s anti-gay law in 2014. In a Texas legislature dominated by conservatives, changing or making laws requires Republican support. But gay rights advocates are forced to devote much of their energy to stopping lawmakers from passing new anti-LGBT bills. One group, Equality Texas, said its lobbying helped kill 19 bills in this year\u2019s session. The Texas Republican party\u2019s platform stated until 2014 that \u201cthe practice of homosexuality tears at the fabric of society and contributes to the breakdown of the family unit\u201d. Its current manifesto still opposes same-sex marriage and says \u201chomosexual behavior\u201d is against \u201cGod\u2019s biblical design\u201d. \u201cThe party\u2019s elected officeholders are terrified of doing anything that would anger the most extreme anti-LGBTQ activists and pressure groups who remain so influential in their party,\u201d said Dan Quinn of the Texas Freedom Network, a progressive advocacy group. \u201cWhile national public opinion has shifted substantially in support of treating LGBTQ Americans and their families equally under the law, too many Texas Republicans continue to see opposition to that as almost a litmus test for conservatives.\u201d Republicans who do anything that could be construed as supportive of LGBT issues fear being challenged by far-right voters in primary elections, said Mary Gonz\u00e1lez, a Democratic state representative from El Paso who identifies as pansexual and is the chair of the Texas house\u2019s recently formed LGBTQ caucus. But she is optimistic that attitudes are changing. \u201cI think what this session taught me is to be much more optimistic when it comes to LGBT justice and advances than in the past. Granted, while we didn\u2019t get anything across the finish line you could see the shift,\u201d she said. \u201cSix years ago I was the only [out LGBT female legislator in Texas] and it was a big deal and people were just really uncomfortable with it. Now there\u2019s five-plus openly out allies, it\u2019s just such a different reality in a short period of time.\u201d Were the supreme court to reverse course one day \u2013 no longer unthinkable given conservatives are now in the majority and the Trump administration has set about rolling back some protections \u2013 the statutes would be in effect once more. \u201cOf course we\u2019re afraid [of that],\u201d Coleman said. But he intends to be back in 2021 for a fresh attempt to repeal the \u201chomosexual conduct\u201d law. \u201cI believe what you do is you continue to advocate for what you believe is right and at some point something will happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThings don\u2019t happen right away but you keep chipping away. In Texas the LGBTQ community has made tons of progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe keep fighting.\u201d",

It\u2019s a 1,000-year-old walled labyrinth with a youthful party scene and a world-class kitesurfing and windsurfing destination. In summer it\u2019s also a destination for families who want just a shady dune, a bar and a place serving fish \u2013 all of which are available in abundance along the 35km of coast north of Tarifa, beyond the beaches of Los Lances (home to Santa Catalina castle, an emblem of Tarifa) and Valdevaqueros to Bolonia with its Roman ruins and the seaside village of Zahara de las Atunes. Its community swelled by surfers who came and never left, Tarifa is a curious mix of off-the-beaten-track, cosmopolitan and barefoot cool, an adventure playground that\u2019s home to some of the best places to eat, drink and stay on the Costa de la Luz. It can also be windy. If it wasn\u2019t, as everyone will tell you, Tarifa would be just another Marbella \u2013 and no one wants that.</p> <h2>What to do</h2> <p><strong>Kitesurfing<br></strong>Tarifa is the kitesurfing capital of Europe for those who like to strap themselves to a board, grab a kite and zip across the water. It\u2019s probably best to take some lessons first. There\u2019s a huge number of places offering courses and equipment hire; long-established Kite Tarifa School (KTS) is certified by the <a href=\"https://www.ikointl.com\" title=\"\">International Kiteboarding Organization</a> and trains instructors and advanced surfers as well as novices, making it a good all-round bet. Owner Daniele Olivieri reckons beginners can master the basics after three to five days.<br>\u2022<em> Beginners\u2019 course (nine hours over three days) from \u20ac195 in group of four or \u20ac295 in a group of two, <a href=\"https://www.ktstarifa.com/en/\" title=\"\">ktstarifa.com</a></em></p> <p><strong>Surfing and windsurfing<br></strong>Yerick Torres of <a href=\"http://balneariosurftarifa.com/\" title=\"\">Balneario Surf</a> gives lessons and rents out boards and wetsuits close to the old town on Playa del Balneario. Remember windsurfing? It\u2019s still a thing. There are courses at <a href=\"http://windwaterexperience.com/\" title=\"\">Wind &amp; Water Experience</a>, north of Los Lances at Camping Torre de la Pe\u00f1a or at the <a href=\"https://www.ion-club.net/en/\" title=\"\">Ion Club</a> (ion-club.net) in Valdevaqueros. The latter has courses and kit for just about every water sport: there are paddleboarding intro courses and excursions for confident practitioners, including the paddle of a lifetime over to Africa.</p> <p><strong>Ride an ebike</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e18de3276b2837552056e120e3cfc82f89c90e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e18de3276b2837552056e120e3cfc82f89c90e5/3839_0_6436_3862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"couple on ebikes with coastal view\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Exhilarating descents are the reward of cyclists who make it up the mountain trails above Tarifa \u2013 but some of the hills are real lungstretchers, which is where ebikes come in. Cycling \u2013 assisted or not \u2013 is also a great way of exploring the flatter coast. eBike Spain on the edge of town has mountain and road ebikes to hire, and also runs guided tours. A new 50km self-guided route takes in the beaches of Zahara de los Atunes and Los Alemanes, before cyclists are collected by van at the end of the ride by the dunes in Bolonia. <br>\u2022 <em>Guided tours from \u20ac50, rental from \u20ac20 a day, </em><em>ebike-spain.com</em></p> <p><strong>Dolphin and whale-watching<br></strong>The Strait of Gibraltar is full of common, striped and bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales (which are also dolphins) plus killer, fin and sperm whales, criss-crossing from Mediterranean to Atlantic.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s the most southerly town in mainland Europe, only 14km from Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar. It\u2019s a 1,000-year-old walled labyrinth with a youthful party scene and a world-class kitesurfing and windsurfing destination. In summer it\u2019s also a destination for families who want just a shady dune, a bar and a place serving fish \u2013 all of which are available in abundance along the 35km of coast north of Tarifa, beyond the beaches of Los Lances (home to Santa Catalina castle, an emblem of Tarifa) and Valdevaqueros to Bolonia with its Roman ruins and the seaside village of Zahara de las Atunes. Its community swelled by surfers who came and never left, Tarifa is a curious mix of off-the-beaten-track, cosmopolitan and barefoot cool, an adventure playground that\u2019s home to some of the best places to eat, drink and stay on the Costa de la Luz. It can also be windy. If it wasn\u2019t, as everyone will tell you, Tarifa would be just another Marbella \u2013 and no one wants that. What to do Kitesurfing Tarifa is the kitesurfing capital of Europe for those who like to strap themselves to a board, grab a kite and zip across the water. It\u2019s probably best to take some lessons first. There\u2019s a huge number of places offering courses and equipment hire; long-established Kite Tarifa School (KTS) is certified by the International Kiteboarding Organization and trains instructors and advanced surfers as well as novices, making it a good all-round bet. Owner Daniele Olivieri reckons beginners can master the basics after three to five days. \u2022 Beginners\u2019 course (nine hours over three days) from \u20ac195 in group of four or \u20ac295 in a group of two, ktstarifa.com Surfing and windsurfing Yerick Torres of Balneario Surf gives lessons and rents out boards and wetsuits close to the old town on Playa del Balneario. Remember windsurfing? It\u2019s still a thing. There are courses at Wind &amp; Water Experience, north of Los Lances at Camping Torre de la Pe\u00f1a or at the Ion Club (ion-club.net) in Valdevaqueros. The latter has courses and kit for just about every water sport: there are paddleboarding intro courses and excursions for confident practitioners, including the paddle of a lifetime over to Africa. Ride an ebike Exhilarating descents are the reward of cyclists who make it up the mountain trails above Tarifa \u2013 but some of the hills are real lungstretchers, which is where ebikes come in. Cycling \u2013 assisted or not \u2013 is also a great way of exploring the flatter coast. eBike Spain on the edge of town has mountain and road ebikes to hire, and also runs guided tours. A new 50km self-guided route takes in the beaches of Zahara de los Atunes and Los Alemanes, before cyclists are collected by van at the end of the ride by the dunes in Bolonia. \u2022 Guided tours from \u20ac50, rental from \u20ac20 a day, ebike-spain.com Dolphin and whale-watching The Strait of Gibraltar is full of common, striped and bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales (which are also dolphins) plus killer, fin and sperm whales, criss-crossing from Mediterranean to Atlantic. The Swiss Foundation for Information and Research on Marine Mammals offers boat trips from March to October. The best time for sperm whales is April to August; dolphins frolic year-round. \u2022 Trips from \u20ac30 adult, \u20ac20 for 6-13s, \u20ac10 for 1-5s, booking essential, firmm.org Where to eat El Lola Bearded waiters in polka-dot aprons, outdoor seating on the prettiest street in town, the strains of flamenco and an exceptional degustaci\u00f3n de at\u00fan rojo (red tuna tasting plate, \u20ac18) make this tapas bar a perennial favourite. Fresh tuna \u2013 tartar, sashimi, tataki, air-dried, barbecued or cold with mayonnaise \u2013 is the thing, but other tapas stalwarts (from \u20ac2) are also great here, especially with ice-cold albari\u00f1o wine or manzanilla sherry. \u2022 ellolatarifa.es, daily 1pm-4pm, and 7pm till late Power House Tarifa Healthy, beautiful people serve healthy, beautiful fare at this cafe on the main road overlooking Los Lances.

On Sunday nights there\u2019s live music in the courtyard and, through summer, a flea market from 11am. \u2022 tarifaecocenter.com, daily 9am-2am Raizes Chefs I\u00f1aki Garc\u00eda Alcalde and Patricia Cord\u00f3n Fuentes have worked in top Basque restaurants and the imaginative, playful dishes they create at Raizes put it in a league of its own.

      "body": "<p>Bid farewell to the merch stand mainstays of T-shirts and tote bags and say hello to pop\u2019s latest money-spinner: weed. Noted musical marijuana enthusiasts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/18/snoop-dogg-bible-of-love-review-inglorious-gospel-rebrand\">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/16/willie-nelson-ive-bought-a-lot-of-pot-and-now-im-selling-some-back\">Willie Nelson </a>and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/05/bob-marley-70-birthday\">Bob Marley</a> family estate have been in the game since 2015 when medical cannabis was made legal in 33 states, but now that recreational use is allowed in 10 states (and the entirety of Canada since last year\u2019s C-45 bill), the green-fingered merch market is booming. And its sights are set firmly on women, the industry\u2019s biggest growth area, with the number of female consumers almost doubling during 2017 to make up 38% of the market, according to a report by cannabis delivery platform Eaze.</p> <p>To appeal to this new fanbase, it\u2019s out with the stoner-dude stereotype of marijuana and in with a new take on getting baked, meaning the kind of musicians you\u2019d see on Pitchfork rather than <a href=\"https://hightimes.com/\">High Times</a> are now getting involved. \u201cMany artists sell clothes or shoes, some sell wine and beer, others advertise for fast-food companies,\u201d explains <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/03/jack-whites-third-man-records-to-open-new-store-in-detroit\">Third Man</a>-signed country singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/22/margo-price-all-american-made-review\">Margo Price</a>, who has a strain named after her last album All American Made. \u201cMe, I\u2019m into selling a plant that God grows,\u201d she says. Currently, Price\u2019s product is only available in California, but it\u2019s proving popular. \u201cFrom what I understand, it\u2019s selling very well!\u201d she says, and she\u2019s hoping it will soon be available in other states, not least because it makes good business sense. \u201cI think there\u2019s more money to be made in the weed industry than selling records. No one buys albums any more \u2013 most people just stream them for free \u2013 but lots of people buy weed!\u201d</p> <p>Price\u2019s weed is a sativa, which, for those who don\u2019t speak fluent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/28/seth-rogen-launches-cannabis-company-houseplant-evan-goldberg\">Seth Rogen</a>, claims to give you an energetic and talkative buzz rather than make you face-plant into the nearest soft furnishings like its more intensely chilled cousin indica. \u201cIt\u2019s great if you need to stay motivated to clean your house,\u201d Price claims.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0314e98d52b77c11d6513a3676fac1265b4a474f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0314e98d52b77c11d6513a3676fac1265b4a474f/93_1024_1791_1075/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miss Grass founders Kate Miller and Anna Duckworth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miss Grass founders Kate Miller and Anna Duckworth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Harper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alternative Americana singer-songwriter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/24/jenny-lewis-on-the-line-review\">Jenny Lewis</a> also has a signature strain inspired by her recent album On the Line, which she says is appealing if you\u2019re trying to actually get stuff done. \u201cShe wanted something energetic, and sativa\u2019s main characteristic is not blow-you-away strong. You can smoke it and then go write a new song, or play some music and talk with a friend,\u201d says Graham Farrar, CEO of Glass House Farms, the eco-friendly, sustainable company that Lewis has partnered with, which tenderly grows its plants by the Californian ocean.</p> <p>Rather than creating her very own strain \u2013 which would be an intense, lengthy process of breeding one plant with another \u2013 Lewis tested 20 different kinds of weed and picked her favourite. \u201cWhen we had our meetings, she showed up and busted out her stash and started smoking. She\u2019s a true fan and not just doing a greenwash,\u201d says Farrar. When it came to picking the strain, it was all about matching the vibe of the album with the weed. \u201cShe has an emotional message she wanted to give to people through her music and we said: \u2018Do that, but do it with our cannabis,\u2019\u201d he explains. For ultimate ease, Lewis\u2019s weed comes available in packs of five pre-rolls, a popular medium for the sale of marijuana in the US, especially for those who have only started experimenting with the drug since its legalisation. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to an audience that\u2019s more canna-curious than expert and a pre-roll is a super-accessible way to do it,\u201d says Farrar.</p> <p>There is, of course, a more serious backdrop to pop culture\u2019s celebration of cannabis. Parallel debates have been running during this current spike in popularity: one, that weed should be decriminalised and normalised; the other taking the view that it\u2019s a gateway drug that affects mental health. For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/19/high-strength-cannabis-increases-risk-of-mental-health-problems\" title=\"\">a study from King\u2019s College London in March this year made a link between frequent cannabis use</a> and high-strength varieties and mental health problems among users; while George Soros\u2019s Drugs Policy Alliance, which is fighting the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, states that rates of schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses have \u201cremained flat even during periods of time when marijuana use rates have increased\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/22/jenny-lewis-its-scary-to-share-this-stuff-but-its-true\">Jenny Lewis: \u2018It\u2019s scary to share this stuff, but it\u2019s true\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Still, the \u201ccanna-curious\u201d market continues to grow, and it is driven by women aged 25 to 44 who are seeking low-dose products as well as new mediums to imbibe the drug, with everything from THC-infused sexual lubricant made by a company called Foria to the discreet, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2018/apr/09/juul-ecigarette-popular-children-vape-pen-nicotine\">Juul</a>-like vape pens rolled out by Price. Increasingly, it is a market run by women as well as targeting them, with 36% of exec roles in the industry taken by women, throwing the US average of 15% into stark relief. A relatively new industry, it doesn\u2019t have a thick glass ceiling to smash. <a href=\"https://www.missgrass.com/\">Miss Grass</a>, an online magazine and artfully curated store, has been called \u201cthe Goop of cannabis\u201d by W Magazine, in reference to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s swanky holistic health brand. Catering specifically to the female-focused weed market, it launched last year in California, but CEO Kate Miller first planted the seeds a decade ago after noticing how little mainstream representation female pot users had. \u201cThere were no brands or media portrayals of cannabis consumers that resembled how myself or my girlfriends were consciously integrating cannabis into our lives,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In 10 years, things have changed a lot. Where once it was Jeff Bridges\u2019s Dude in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers\">The Big Lebowski</a>, or Seth Rogen in ... everything, shows such as Broad City and HBO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/16/high-maintenance-hbo-vimeo-series-fall-tv\">High Maintenance</a>, and the Netflix film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/18/someone-great-review-another-run-of-the-mill-romcom-from-netflix\">Someone Great</a>, have begun to shine a light on female stoners. Marijuana is fast becoming a lifestyle choice, rolled into the current vogue for \u201cself-care\u201d, and is no longer the sole preserve of bros who wake and bake in order to watch reruns of South Park. It is a key part of the latest cult lifestyle trend: \u201cCalifornia sober\u201d. A term coined by writer Michelle Lhooq, it sees people in LA shunning alcohol and drugs, apart from natural psychedelics and marijuana, fitting in neatly with Lewis and Price\u2019s products and Lhooq\u2019s own LA-based Weed Rave, where marijuana rather than class A drugs is the favoured party fuel.</p> <p>\u201cIt was kind of tongue-in-cheek, obviously; I know I\u2019m not sober-sober, but also a way to espouse a different paradigm when it comes to drugs,\u201d explains Lhooq, the author of Weed: Everything You Want to Know But Are Always Too Stoned to Ask. \u201cOur relationship to \u2018drugs\u2019 is quickly evolving, especially with the huge breakthroughs that researchers have discovered with weed and psychedelics being used for medicine and the wreckage that pharmaceuticals have caused,\u201d she adds.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"298fdacebf56b9802438300bd0a11e5d0ad0d4a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/298fdacebf56b9802438300bd0a11e5d0ad0d4a3/89_65_822_855/481.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Jones\u2019s cannabis-infused Sigur R\u00f3s wild sigurberry gumdrops.\" width=\"481\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Jones\u2019s cannabis-infused Sigur R\u00f3s wild sigurberry gumdrops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lord Jones</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, there is one element to this rise in white indie musicians and millennial TV shows glamourising and normalising recreational marijuana that sits uneasily. The pop-cultural buzz runs adjacent to the fact that many black Americans are disproportionately targeted for cannabis crimes and remain in prison for offences related to the drug, despite its subsequent decriminalisation. Currently making the headlines is the case of 68-year-old Michael Thompson, who has been in jail since 1994 after selling cannabis to a police informant in Michigan, where the drug is now legal. This is an issue in which fame doesn\u2019t help, either. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/30/snoop-dogg-banned-norway-drug-marijuana\">Snoop Dogg was banned from Norway</a> for two years for possession for the drug.</p> <p>Lhooq is aware that something needs to be done in the US to reverse such treatment. \u201cThis is something that is being talked about in many corners of the cannabis industry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe question of how to create a system of reparations is one of the most interesting and unique challenges this industry faces. One way that this could be turned around is for more companies to create give-back programmes, where a portion of their profits goes towards programmes or nonprofits that are fighting for criminal-record expungement and making it easier for those who have been imprisoned to enter the cannabis industry.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the UK, things are somewhat different. Marijuana is still illegal and the canna-curious won\u2019t be able to float away on a couple of Sigur R\u00f3s\u2019s edible Wild Sigurberry gumdrops any time soon. But people are approaching a greener mindset. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/05/cbd-a-marijuana-miracle-or-another-health-fad-cannabidiol-anxiety-epilepsy\">Cannabidiol</a> \u2013 more commonly known as CBD \u2013 is weed without THC, AKA the psychoactive part that makes you want to get really into Pink Floyd and eat endless Jaffa Cakes. And so long as it contains no more than 0.2% THC, CBD is legal. It will not get you high, but its benefits are wrapped up in the wellness movement. In a medical industry that is still largely run by \u2013 and for \u2013 men, it is rare for a drug that reportedly helps pain unique to women get so much attention. Interestingly, another pop-cultural icon is at the forefront of the industry. Oscar-winning actor Whoopi Goldberg is a champion of CBD and THC products for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/28/are-weed-tampons-answer-to-period-pain-cbd-suppositories-pms\">period pain</a> in the US, with her Whoopi &amp; Maya line of tinctures, soaks and body rubs.</p> <p>Rachna Patel, a former doctor who left the world of mainstream medicine after seeing the damage done by opioids, recently published The CBD Oil Solution. She sings the praises of CBD, explaining how it has helped her patients overcome everything from traumatic sexual history to period cramps. Her main concern about the boom in CBD, however, concerns the lack of regulation. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s out of control,\u201d she explains, questioning the quality of some brands on the market. \u201cIf you\u2019re using this as a lubricant, you don\u2019t want some fungus up your vagina,\u201d she says of the drug\u2019s susceptibility to microorganisms. Quite.</p> <p>Over in the US, we can expect to see more and more artists putting out their own strains of weed, with both Lewis and Price keen to add to their current product lines. \u201cThe folks at Willie\u2019s Reserve [<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/27/willie-nelson-to-open-chain-of-marijuana-stores\">Willie Nelson\u2019s weed line</a>, through which Price releases her products] have been working with growers in Colorado to make me an indica strain,\u201d says Price of her future plans. \u201cI struggle with insomnia and back pain and indica is especially good with aiding such ailments. It\u2019s more of a relaxing, sink down in the couch and fall asleep-type weed.\u201d</p> <p>As for music and celebrity\u2019s swing towards a greener merchandise, Lhooq is certain this is just the beginning. \u201cIt definitely feels like any remaining stigma is pretty much gone. You could even say cannabis is the new perfume.\u201d</p> <p>Price, meanwhile, is just happy she is not going to land up in a cell for this latest venture, as she might have done a few years ago. \u201cI sold weed for years illegally; once in college I picked up a pound of weed in Chicago and sold it ounce by ounce,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream to do it again.\u201d</p> <p>Surely now it is only a matter of time before we see British artists getting involved. Adele-branded CBD throat sweets and Jorja Smith\u2019s relaxing bath bombs, anyone?</p>",

      "bodyText": "Bid farewell to the merch stand mainstays of T-shirts and tote bags and say hello to pop\u2019s latest money-spinner: weed. Noted musical marijuana enthusiasts Snoop Dogg, Willie Nelson and the Bob Marley family estate have been in the game since 2015 when medical cannabis was made legal in 33 states, but now that recreational use is allowed in 10 states (and the entirety of Canada since last year\u2019s C-45 bill), the green-fingered merch market is booming. And its sights are set firmly on women, the industry\u2019s biggest growth area, with the number of female consumers almost doubling during 2017 to make up 38% of the market, according to a report by cannabis delivery platform Eaze. To appeal to this new fanbase, it\u2019s out with the stoner-dude stereotype of marijuana and in with a new take on getting baked, meaning the kind of musicians you\u2019d see on Pitchfork rather than High Times are now getting involved. \u201cMany artists sell clothes or shoes, some sell wine and beer, others advertise for fast-food companies,\u201d explains Third Man-signed country singer Margo Price, who has a strain named after her last album All American Made. \u201cMe, I\u2019m into selling a plant that God grows,\u201d she says. Currently, Price\u2019s product is only available in California, but it\u2019s proving popular. \u201cFrom what I understand, it\u2019s selling very well!\u201d she says, and she\u2019s hoping it will soon be available in other states, not least because it makes good business sense. \u201cI think there\u2019s more money to be made in the weed industry than selling records. No one buys albums any more \u2013 most people just stream them for free \u2013 but lots of people buy weed!\u201d Price\u2019s weed is a sativa, which, for those who don\u2019t speak fluent Seth Rogen, claims to give you an energetic and talkative buzz rather than make you face-plant into the nearest soft furnishings like its more intensely chilled cousin indica. \u201cIt\u2019s great if you need to stay motivated to clean your house,\u201d Price claims. Alternative Americana singer-songwriter Jenny Lewis also has a signature strain inspired by her recent album On the Line, which she says is appealing if you\u2019re trying to actually get stuff done. \u201cShe wanted something energetic, and sativa\u2019s main characteristic is not blow-you-away strong. You can smoke it and then go write a new song, or play some music and talk with a friend,\u201d says Graham Farrar, CEO of Glass House Farms, the eco-friendly, sustainable company that Lewis has partnered with, which tenderly grows its plants by the Californian ocean. Rather than creating her very own strain \u2013 which would be an intense, lengthy process of breeding one plant with another \u2013 Lewis tested 20 different kinds of weed and picked her favourite. \u201cWhen we had our meetings, she showed up and busted out her stash and started smoking. She\u2019s a true fan and not just doing a greenwash,\u201d says Farrar. When it came to picking the strain, it was all about matching the vibe of the album with the weed. \u201cShe has an emotional message she wanted to give to people through her music and we said: \u2018Do that, but do it with our cannabis,\u2019\u201d he explains. For ultimate ease, Lewis\u2019s weed comes available in packs of five pre-rolls, a popular medium for the sale of marijuana in the US, especially for those who have only started experimenting with the drug since its legalisation. \u201cWe\u2019re talking to an audience that\u2019s more canna-curious than expert and a pre-roll is a super-accessible way to do it,\u201d says Farrar. There is, of course, a more serious backdrop to pop culture\u2019s celebration of cannabis. Parallel debates have been running during this current spike in popularity: one, that weed should be decriminalised and normalised; the other taking the view that it\u2019s a gateway drug that affects mental health. For example, a study from King\u2019s College London in March this year made a link between frequent cannabis use and high-strength varieties and mental health problems among users; while George Soros\u2019s Drugs Policy Alliance, which is fighting the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, states that rates of schizophrenia and other psychiatric illnesses have \u201cremained flat even during periods of time when marijuana use rates have increased\u201d. Still, the \u201ccanna-curious\u201d market continues to grow, and it is driven by women aged 25 to 44 who are seeking low-dose products as well as new mediums to imbibe the drug, with everything from THC-infused sexual lubricant made by a company called Foria to the discreet, Juul-like vape pens rolled out by Price. Increasingly, it is a market run by women as well as targeting them, with 36% of exec roles in the industry taken by women, throwing the US average of 15% into stark relief. A relatively new industry, it doesn\u2019t have a thick glass ceiling to smash. Miss Grass, an online magazine and artfully curated store, has been called \u201cthe Goop of cannabis\u201d by W Magazine, in reference to Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s swanky holistic health brand. Catering specifically to the female-focused weed market, it launched last year in California, but CEO Kate Miller first planted the seeds a decade ago after noticing how little mainstream representation female pot users had. \u201cThere were no brands or media portrayals of cannabis consumers that resembled how myself or my girlfriends were consciously integrating cannabis into our lives,\u201d she says. In 10 years, things have changed a lot. Where once it was Jeff Bridges\u2019s Dude in The Big Lebowski, or Seth Rogen in ... everything, shows such as Broad City and HBO\u2019s High Maintenance, and the Netflix film Someone Great, have begun to shine a light on female stoners. Marijuana is fast becoming a lifestyle choice, rolled into the current vogue for \u201cself-care\u201d, and is no longer the sole preserve of bros who wake and bake in order to watch reruns of South Park. It is a key part of the latest cult lifestyle trend: \u201cCalifornia sober\u201d. A term coined by writer Michelle Lhooq, it sees people in LA shunning alcohol and drugs, apart from natural psychedelics and marijuana, fitting in neatly with Lewis and Price\u2019s products and Lhooq\u2019s own LA-based Weed Rave, where marijuana rather than class A drugs is the favoured party fuel. \u201cIt was kind of tongue-in-cheek, obviously; I know I\u2019m not sober-sober, but also a way to espouse a different paradigm when it comes to drugs,\u201d explains Lhooq, the author of Weed: Everything You Want to Know But Are Always Too Stoned to Ask. \u201cOur relationship to \u2018drugs\u2019 is quickly evolving, especially with the huge breakthroughs that researchers have discovered with weed and psychedelics being used for medicine and the wreckage that pharmaceuticals have caused,\u201d she adds. However, there is one element to this rise in white indie musicians and millennial TV shows glamourising and normalising recreational marijuana that sits uneasily. The pop-cultural buzz runs adjacent to the fact that many black Americans are disproportionately targeted for cannabis crimes and remain in prison for offences related to the drug, despite its subsequent decriminalisation. Currently making the headlines is the case of 68-year-old Michael Thompson, who has been in jail since 1994 after selling cannabis to a police informant in Michigan, where the drug is now legal. This is an issue in which fame doesn\u2019t help, either. Snoop Dogg was banned from Norway for two years for possession for the drug. Lhooq is aware that something needs to be done in the US to reverse such treatment. \u201cThis is something that is being talked about in many corners of the cannabis industry,\u201d she says. \u201cThe question of how to create a system of reparations is one of the most interesting and unique challenges this industry faces. One way that this could be turned around is for more companies to create give-back programmes, where a portion of their profits goes towards programmes or nonprofits that are fighting for criminal-record expungement and making it easier for those who have been imprisoned to enter the cannabis industry.\u201d Back in the UK, things are somewhat different. Marijuana is still illegal and the canna-curious won\u2019t be able to float away on a couple of Sigur R\u00f3s\u2019s edible Wild Sigurberry gumdrops any time soon. But people are approaching a greener mindset. Cannabidiol \u2013 more commonly known as CBD \u2013 is weed without THC, AKA the psychoactive part that makes you want to get really into Pink Floyd and eat endless Jaffa Cakes. And so long as it contains no more than 0.2% THC, CBD is legal. It will not get you high, but its benefits are wrapped up in the wellness movement. In a medical industry that is still largely run by \u2013 and for \u2013 men, it is rare for a drug that reportedly helps pain unique to women get so much attention. Interestingly, another pop-cultural icon is at the forefront of the industry. Oscar-winning actor Whoopi Goldberg is a champion of CBD and THC products for period pain in the US, with her Whoopi &amp; Maya line of tinctures, soaks and body rubs. Rachna Patel, a former doctor who left the world of mainstream medicine after seeing the damage done by opioids, recently published The CBD Oil Solution. She sings the praises of CBD, explaining how it has helped her patients overcome everything from traumatic sexual history to period cramps. Her main concern about the boom in CBD, however, concerns the lack of regulation. \u201cRight now, it\u2019s out of control,\u201d she explains, questioning the quality of some brands on the market. \u201cIf you\u2019re using this as a lubricant, you don\u2019t want some fungus up your vagina,\u201d she says of the drug\u2019s susceptibility to microorganisms. Quite. Over in the US, we can expect to see more and more artists putting out their own strains of weed, with both Lewis and Price keen to add to their current product lines. \u201cThe folks at Willie\u2019s Reserve [Willie Nelson\u2019s weed line, through which Price releases her products] have been working with growers in Colorado to make me an indica strain,\u201d says Price of her future plans. \u201cI struggle with insomnia and back pain and indica is especially good with aiding such ailments. It\u2019s more of a relaxing, sink down in the couch and fall asleep-type weed.\u201d As for music and celebrity\u2019s swing towards a greener merchandise, Lhooq is certain this is just the beginning. \u201cIt definitely feels like any remaining stigma is pretty much gone. You could even say cannabis is the new perfume.\u201d Price, meanwhile, is just happy she is not going to land up in a cell for this latest venture, as she might have done a few years ago. \u201cI sold weed for years illegally; once in college I picked up a pound of weed in Chicago and sold it ounce by ounce,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a dream to do it again.\u201d Surely now it is only a matter of time before we see British artists getting involved. Adele-branded CBD throat sweets and Jorja Smith\u2019s relaxing bath bombs, anyone?",

      "bodyText": "I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve noticed, but happiness is in sharp decline. Many people blame technology for our woes, and it\u2019s not hard to see why. The internet is nothing but deranged screeching and fascist memes sitting atop a plateau of moldering desperation masquerading as ironic meaninglessness. No one has smiled in real life since 2011. But wait! Silicon Valley is waking up to the negative effect its products can have on us, and like the good Samaritans they are, they\u2019re unveiling a whole new range of products aimed at making us feel good about ourselves. Here is an exclusive look at just a few of the cool gizmos and rad gadgets due to be unveiled at next year\u2019s CES Consumer Electronics Show and featured in news reports, and then in shops, and then in your house before you even know it. Dig Deep\u00ae Everyone knows workouts are great for your body, but the narcissistic self-involvement required to carve out a ripped physique \u2013 all that pumping iron in front of a gymnasium mirror \u2013 can leave you feeling strangely hollow inside. Until now! Now you can build muscle and a sense of altruism with Dig Deep\u00ae, the VR fitness product that helps you build a ripped new body while making you feel like a saint! Simply pop on the VR headset and bam \u2013 you\u2019re instantly transported to an impoverished African village in dire need of fresh drinking water. See and hear photorealistic locals begging you for help! Then simply grab the supplied motion-sensitive Sweat Shovel\u00ae, begin to perform repetitive digging motions, and you\u2019ll start excavating a well in real time! Feel the burn as you burrow metres underground \u2013 all the way down to the water table. Hear ecstatic local children chanting your name as you finally hit fresh H2O! You\u2019ll be a hero \u2013 and you\u2019ll have earned yourself a rock-hard core to boot! It\u2019s just like volunteering for a backbreaking humanitarian project \u2013 minus the bothersome malaria jabs and sunstroke. Crudstergram\u00ae Photo-based social media apps are all very well, but who wants to be perpetually reminded that absolutely everyone else in the world is younger, sexier, more adventurous and happier than you are, as you stare at them in gutless wonder like a 56-year-old wino gazing through the window of a restaurant in which the Kardashians sip champagne from high-heeled diamond shoes? Or a dying dog glancing at a chandelier \u2026 whichever analogy best matches the continuous negative roaring in your head, which has been there so long you scarcely notice it any more. But listen. Listen. Yes. There it is. Louder than the universe, deeper than the sea. Well fuck that. Use Crudstergram. Crudstergram turns the aspirational world of photo-sharing on its head by filtering your usual feed through a state-of-the-art AI-based machine-learning algorithmic algorithm that automatically fattens faces, adds blemishes, removes beautifying filters and applies a visual stink to all that it surveys. And that\u2019s not all! It also parses messages, replacing smug sentiments and upbeat emoji with wails of despair and anguished cries for help. Scroll through an endless blur of bite-sized bulletins from people looking their worst and enduring hilarious misery \u2013 and feel your own self-worth swell by comparison until that internal screaming goes away. Or at least pops down to the shops for a bit. Delete all other apps today. Raze them from the screen \u2013 from your life \u2013 and replace them with Crudstergram. Now. Do it. Do it. Do it now. Do it. Now. NOW! DO IT NOW! Peter Pooper\u00ae \u2013 Your Toilet Pal Real talk: everyone enjoys defecating more than they let on. And yet still, in 2019, it\u2019s an act surrounded with shame and secrecy. Until today! Now you can share the wonder of shitting with the world\u2019s most intelligent and obsequious talking smart toilet! Enter the bathroom and Peter Pooper automatically lifts his lid, imploring you to take a seat. As you defecate into his mouth he\u2019ll analyse your bowel movement, offering dietary advice while also complimenting you on its aroma, taste and texture like a judge on a cookery show. No need for self-wiping either \u2013 this isn\u2019t the Middle Ages for Christ\u2019s sake. Peter Pooper\u00ae will clean and polish your dainty little bum button with his rubberized Motor Tongue\u00ae before flushing away your chestnut soil with a satisfied swallowing noise while tears of gratitude glisten in his eyes. Did we mention his eyes? He has eyes. Eyes only for you. And as you leave the room he\u2019ll scream that he\u2019s in love with you and threaten to kill himself if you so much as think of moving house. \u2022 Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June.",

Fortunately the college game can afford the coaches and hopefully will pick up the slack, to ensure 2019 becomes the norm rather than the exception.\u201d As the Eagles go for glory in Paris, many who hope to follow them will be on show at the Talen Energy Stadium near Philadelphia, at the 10th annual Collegiate Rugby Championships. Last year\u2019s CRC MVP, former wrestler Ben Broselle, went from UCLA into Friday\u2019s squad. Students of sevens watching the world title decider in Paris would do well to keep an eye on events in Chester, PA as well.",

He walked for two years across Asia, part of which took in a traverse of part of Afghanistan in 2002, which led to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/sep/01/guardianfirstbookaward2004.gurardianfirstbookaward5\">bestselling book</a>, The Places In Between.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a10b966da783e089b41fc2dc8876513e0a276079\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a10b966da783e089b41fc2dc8876513e0a276079/0_70_1625_975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Stewart walking in Afghanistan aged 29, an experience he described in the book The Places In Between.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Stewart walking in Afghanistan aged 29, an experience he described in the book The Places In Between.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Loomis/LA Times via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has worked as the deputy to a US \u201cgovernate coordinator\u201d of an Iraqi region, been a lecturer at Harvard, and run a small NGO in Kabul.

In 2008 Esquire <a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a5052/rory-stewart-1008/\">declared him</a> one of the 75 most important people of the 21st century.</p> <p>Much of which, to some observers, is hyperbolic at best. Though few would speak on the record, there is a broad critique of Stewart that his biography is a little overegged and certainly self-regarding \u2013 leading to a nickname, a member of his wider social circle confides, of \u201cFlorence of Belgravia\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2327aa9d674b7c57688b83575a92e98f01d349f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2327aa9d674b7c57688b83575a92e98f01d349f/0_121_5070_3042/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Henry Lloyd-Hughes plays Stewart in Occupational Hazards at the Hampstead theatre in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Henry Lloyd-Hughes plays Stewart in Occupational Hazards at the Hampstead theatre in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marc Brenner</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though Stewart <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/11/15/paths-of-glory-ian-parker\">has claimed to know</a> \u201cwhat it feels like to be in the army\u201d, for instance, he spent only a gap year stint in the Black Watch and did not see active service. He can often give the impression his role in Iraq was rather more important than the reality, according to someone who witnessed his work there (\u201cHe was regarded as a pretty competent mid-ranking Foreign Office official \u2026 He wasn\u2019t a nonentity and I think the view in Iraq was that he was conscientious, but he wasn\u2019t Lawrence of Arabia.\u201d)</p> <p>Several well-placed observers of Stewart\u2019s time in Afghanistan point out that his much-discussed Afghan walk, the origin of his reputation as an expert on the region, was a month spent crossing a comparatively safe part of the country (\u201cOther people would call it a walking holiday,\u201d notes one). Others accuse him of a somewhat colonialist mindset, abroad and at home; a friend who has known Stewart for many years recalled him discussing a plan to live in a council estate for a year to see how others live.</p> <p>\u201cIn general, he has done a lot and it\u2019s all very impressive,\u201d says someone who observed Stewart at close quarters in Kabul. \u201cBut it\u2019s not quite as impressive and remarkable as he allows people to think. This is not necessarily all his doing, but the willingness of others to project things on to him \u2026 All sorts of journalists wrote up the Turquoise Mountain Foundation [Stewart\u2019s Afghan NGO, which aimed to preserve local crafts] as the most amazing project in Afghanistan, when it was actually a rather low impact thing that affected the lives of a small number of people.\u201d</p> <p>Claims <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ow00clo09k\">this week</a> to have \u201cnegotiated in Iraq, negotiated in Afghanistan\u201d provoked \u201csnorts of derision\u201d, the former Afghanistan correspondent Jon Boone <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jon_Boone/status/1132170849728045056\">tweeted</a>. \u201cWho with, the Kabul guild of potters and calligraphers?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1ab97795fb1d9cf39b251be5b8ddf0efb011c56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1ab97795fb1d9cf39b251be5b8ddf0efb011c56/0_0_3047_1829/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stewart in Maysan province, Iraq, in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stewart in Maysan province, Iraq, in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Chung/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some of this may be Etonian self-confidence, some an understandable tendency to self-promotion during a leadership campaign. He would not be the first politician to be accused of vanity, and to his credit he does not dissemble when asked directly about his experience (\u201cIt was unbelievably brief,\u201d he told the New Yorker of his time in the Black Watch.)</p> <p>And in a time of political crisis, Stewart\u2019s supporters would argue, one\u2019s background is surely less important than one\u2019s competence and intentions. Prentis, a former government lawyer who has particular expertise in the justice system, says Stewart impressed her during his brief stint as prisons minister with his diligence and attention to detail.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no rubbish with Rory, ever. He will always ask and seek and check, but you do feel that there is an honesty and an integrity there which isn\u2019t usual in political discussion.\u201d</p> <p>Why, if that is the case, aren\u2019t more Tories openly supporting him? \u201cI suppose there are safer options,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure that this is the minute for safety.\u201d</p>",

Stewart, who is 46, now wants to be prime minister, along with at least 11 (it could easily be more by the time you read this) other Conservative colleagues. But do the Tories really think the best person to lead Britain through the Brexit crisis is (another) Old Etonian, who throws around Latin epigraphs and is considered, by the admittedly monochrome standards of Westminster, to be dashingly unconventional? Well, of course they do \u2013 it\u2019s just that they want the other one. Boris Johnson, still regarded as the clear frontrunner, has the declared support of almost 30 fellow Tory MPs, who will ultimately decide the two names that are placed before the party membership. Stewart has two. It would take a bold speculator to back Stewart for anything other than crushing defeat. And yet in the past week the MP has been capturing attention and praise with a campaign that is as idiosyncratic as he is. Stewart, now international development secretary, has embarked on a whistlestop tour of the country, chatting to shopkeepers in Warrington and students in Edinburgh, visiting a mosque in Woking and exchanging \u201crusty\u201d Dari with Afghans in Barking. His many media interviews, meanwhile, in which he has surgically outlined why he would rule out a no-deal Brexit (he is the only candidate to do so), have won broad and sometimes surprising support from left and right. Columnists in the Spectator have praised his \u201crefreshing ridiculousness\u201d and argued he can \u201csave the Tories\u201d. Writers in the Guardian have praised him for putting \u201cprinciple before power\u201d and suggested he could come through the centre ground as a surprising winner. The scientist Brian Cox and Gary Lineker are admirers. Why? \u201cHe is the very opposite of a career politician who has spent his life in the Westminster bubble,\u201d says Stewart\u2019s friend the documentary producer Jemima Khan, \u201cand he is not afraid to get out and speak to people and to listen. \u201cThe skills that a leader most needs right now \u2026 are common sense, logic, diplomacy and pragmatism \u2013 not hyperbole, jingoism and wishful thinking.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear that he is talking to people \u2013 young people, people who are disaffected with politics or who haven\u2019t voted Conservative recently \u2013 in a way that other people aren\u2019t,\u201d argues Victoria Prentis, one of the MPs backing him. Stewart\u2019s talent, she says, is that he \u201creaches the parts other Tories can\u2019t\u201d; it is a phrase, word for word, that one used to hear about Johnson. If the two men certainly have plenty in common \u2013 prep school, Eton, Oxford (where Stewart, like Cameron, did PPE) \u2013 Stewart has a much more eccentric biography than the man he describes, damningly, as \u201ca very talented journalist\u201d. The son of a senior MI6 officer who would wake the young Roderick at 6am to practice fencing in Hyde Park, he grew up in Hong Kong and Malaysia and \u201ca classic small country mansion\u201d in the Scottish Borders. He was a summer tutor to princes William and Harry, served briefly in the British army, and worked for the Foreign Office in Indonesia and Montenegro (about which he offers baroque denials that he was a spy). He walked for two years across Asia, part of which took in a traverse of part of Afghanistan in 2002, which led to a bestselling book, The Places In Between. He has worked as the deputy to a US \u201cgovernate coordinator\u201d of an Iraqi region, been a lecturer at Harvard, and run a small NGO in Kabul. He has been the subject of a well-received play in London, been profiled by Time Magazine and (unmissably) the New Yorker, and has sold the film rights of his Afghanistan book to Brad Pitt\u2019s production company. In 2008 Esquire declared him one of the 75 most important people of the 21st century. Much of which, to some observers, is hyperbolic at best. Though few would speak on the record, there is a broad critique of Stewart that his biography is a little overegged and certainly self-regarding \u2013 leading to a nickname, a member of his wider social circle confides, of \u201cFlorence of Belgravia\u201d. Though Stewart has claimed to know \u201cwhat it feels like to be in the army\u201d, for instance, he spent only a gap year stint in the Black Watch and did not see active service. He can often give the impression his role in Iraq was rather more important than the reality, according to someone who witnessed his work there (\u201cHe was regarded as a pretty competent mid-ranking Foreign Office official \u2026 He wasn\u2019t a nonentity and I think the view in Iraq was that he was conscientious, but he wasn\u2019t Lawrence of Arabia.\u201d) Several well-placed observers of Stewart\u2019s time in Afghanistan point out that his much-discussed Afghan walk, the origin of his reputation as an expert on the region, was a month spent crossing a comparatively safe part of the country (\u201cOther people would call it a walking holiday,\u201d notes one). Others accuse him of a somewhat colonialist mindset, abroad and at home; a friend who has known Stewart for many years recalled him discussing a plan to live in a council estate for a year to see how others live. \u201cIn general, he has done a lot and it\u2019s all very impressive,\u201d says someone who observed Stewart at close quarters in Kabul. \u201cBut it\u2019s not quite as impressive and remarkable as he allows people to think. This is not necessarily all his doing, but the willingness of others to project things on to him \u2026 All sorts of journalists wrote up the Turquoise Mountain Foundation [Stewart\u2019s Afghan NGO, which aimed to preserve local crafts] as the most amazing project in Afghanistan, when it was actually a rather low impact thing that affected the lives of a small number of people.\u201d Claims this week to have \u201cnegotiated in Iraq, negotiated in Afghanistan\u201d provoked \u201csnorts of derision\u201d, the former Afghanistan correspondent Jon Boone tweeted. \u201cWho with, the Kabul guild of potters and calligraphers?\u201d Some of this may be Etonian self-confidence, some an understandable tendency to self-promotion during a leadership campaign. He would not be the first politician to be accused of vanity, and to his credit he does not dissemble when asked directly about his experience (\u201cIt was unbelievably brief,\u201d he told the New Yorker of his time in the Black Watch.) And in a time of political crisis, Stewart\u2019s supporters would argue, one\u2019s background is surely less important than one\u2019s competence and intentions. Prentis, a former government lawyer who has particular expertise in the justice system, says Stewart impressed her during his brief stint as prisons minister with his diligence and attention to detail. \u201cThere is no rubbish with Rory, ever. He will always ask and seek and check, but you do feel that there is an honesty and an integrity there which isn\u2019t usual in political discussion.\u201d Why, if that is the case, aren\u2019t more Tories openly supporting him? \u201cI suppose there are safer options,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure that this is the minute for safety.\u201d",

Jeremy Hunt Backbenchers have noticed his tally of declared supporters has not grown, while his apparent flip-flopping on no deal has not gone down well with some. Has lost ground to Gove as the moderates\u2019 choice. Andrea Leadsom With only two declared supporters so far there were rumours that she could pull out of the race at an early stage, with the aim of securing herself a top job by backing a rival. The likes of Johnson and Raab have already secured much of the support she had before conceding to Theresa May in 2016. Sajid Javid Daily announcements of supporters have kept him from falling away. Although he cannot be written off, there is a concern he lacks a natural constituency among MPs. Esther McVey Although a rightwing line on LGBT relationship education may go down well with the rank and file, her remarks on the subject backfired when they drew swift criticism from fellow MPs Amber Rudd and Justine Greening, highlighting her potential to be divisive.",

Tucker Carlson described the special counsel as \u201csleazy and dishonest\u201d, Sean Hannity said \u201che\u2019s basically full of crap\u201d and Laura Ingraham insisted: \u201cThe deep state set Candidate Trump up after it became obvious he was going to win the nomination.\u201d There is ample backup from Breitbart News, the Federalist \u2013 \u201cLawsuit Exposes How The Media And Deep State Hatched The Russiagate Hoax\u201d \u2013 the One America News Network and the Sinclair Broadcast Group, along with media figures such as Lou Dobbs, Mark Levin and Rush Limbaugh. But none has the power of Fox News, the top-rated cable network, where Don Jr, the former House speaker Newt Gingrich, the ex-White House press secretary Sean Spicer and others sell the president\u2019s message to millions of viewers. Kurt Bardella, a former House oversight committee and Breitbart spokesman, said: \u201cPeople who worked for [Trump] or are making money off him go out and say something on Fox News. The president will watch it and regurgitate it. They will then get to say, \u2018Like the president said \u2026\u2019 If you took Fox out of the equation, you\u2019d go back to the old media ecosystem.\u201d \u2018A delicate counter-offensive\u2019 It does not take much for a wild idea to hop from the dark reaches of the internet to Fox News to Capitol Hill to the White House and back again. Today\u2019s fringe rumour is tomorrow\u2019s Republican conventional wisdom. Some argue that paves the way for a constitutional crisis. Bardella added: \u201cTrump\u2019s congressional enablers talk about these conspiracy theories and legitimise them. Apparently the attorney general sees himself as Trump protector rather than the defender of justice. There\u2019s nothing to stop them trying to chase down these conspiracy theories and using all the official tools at their disposal to do so.\u201d However, the Trump presidency has met resistance from activists, Democrats and institutions. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, suggested that the Trump ecosystem would not have everything its own way. \u201cThere are wealthy Republicans who are uncomfortable with Sebastian Gorka and the like,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Republican establishment will push back through Fox, the Wall Street Journal and other outlets. The titans of the economy will put up with stuff only so long.\u201d Even Fox News is not as monolithic as many assume and contains critical voices. This week the host Shep Smith told viewers: \u201cThe president attacking the investigator, true to pattern.\u201d Schiller added: \u201cFox has let Chris Wallace, Brit Hume and Shep Smith off the range. They\u2019ve done town halls with Democrats. There\u2019s a delicate counter-offensive against the power of the president.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>During the recent school holidays, Charlie Brooker made a deal with his seven-year-old son. \u201cI said, \u2018Right, you\u2019ve got these tests coming up\u2019 (these <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/14/sats-for-seven-year-olds-in-england-to-be-scrapped\">stupid SAT things</a>),\u201d he tells me. \u201cI had a book of mock exams and I said, \u2018If you do one of these every morning, half an hour, maths or English, then you can do whatever the fuck you want the rest of the day.\u2019\u201d Actually he didn\u2019t swear, Brooker adds.</p> <p>And what did Brooker Jr want to do for the rest of the day? Play video games. He likes the ones where you create levels and customise characters, like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/15/super-mario-maker-review-nintendo-wii-u-designable-shigeru-miyamoto\">Super Mario Maker</a>. \u201cIf anything, he\u2019s more into computer games than I am, which is a statement I didn\u2019t think it was possible to utter,\u201d his dad, 48, tells me, not unproudly.</p> <p>It was a good deal, that worked for both of them. \u201cI assuaged parental guilt by making him sit an exam, he got to play computer games all day long, so it meant I could also do what the fuck I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Brooker\u2019s other child, five, is \u2013 disappointingly \u2013 less into gaming. Less into Dad too (\u201cI don\u2019t want you, I want Mummy,\u201d he shouts when he hurts himself) but that\u2019s by-the-by and possibly not for ever. \u201cHe wants to watch little bastards opening presents on YouTube, that\u2019s his jam,\u201d says Brooker, before adding that the jam phrase is not one he has used before. He does that sometimes, stepping aside from himself to have a listen to what is spewing from his mouth: is that good, bad, or just surprising, he seems to ask himself.</p> <p>Does he make any attempts to limit the kids\u2019 screen time I wonder. \u201cI mean you try to a bit, but I don\u2019t worry too much about that because I sort of think by the time they\u2019re grown up the only job left will be robot polishing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they might as well enjoy themselves and get used to clicking things. I kind of think as long as they\u2019re happy \u2026 I have heard myself saying: \u2018It\u2019s a lovely day outside, come on,\u2019 which was my parents\u2019 theme tune I remember in the summer holiday. \u2018What are you doing sitting indoors, playing on the Spectrum? It\u2019s sunny!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Brooker grew up in the village of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell in Oxfordshire. An early portent of what lay ahead was a comic he made himself, filled with violence, anger and jokes, and then sneaked into his primary school comic box.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ymjp2uIBws\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5ymjp2uIBws?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The Twilight Zone \u2026 the programme\u2019s dark tone influenced Charlie Brooker</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At home his dad showed him repeats of Monty Python, and Charlie liked watching things like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/1999/jul/12/broadcasting.mondaymediasection\" title=\"\">Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/apr/15/how-we-made-spitting-image\" title=\"\">Spitting Image</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/29/your-next-boxset-young-ones\" title=\"\">The Young Ones</a>. \u201cGenerally speaking, shows that were tinkering about with the format. I remember seeing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/airplane-comedy\" title=\"\">Airplane!</a> in the cinema and thinking, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made films like that, that\u2019s the best film ever made!\u2019 When I was a bit older I would stay up and catch <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/may/07/twilight-zone-rod-serling\" title=\"\">The Twilight Zone</a>. I always liked nasty, twist-in-the-tale type stories as well \u2013 Hammer House of Horror is another one, because it had this horrible British sensibility, so it looked like a sitcom but there were people being stabbed in the neck with trowels. Stuff that broke the fourth wall, was anarchic, The Young Ones, stuff that had a strong flavour.\u201d</p> <p>Around about the same time, at the local leisure centre, he discovered the first arcade games, such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man. \u201cAnd thinking you can control that, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d Brooker now has a vintage arcade game at home.</p> <p>He didn\u2019t get a degree; Central London Poly didn\u2019t want his dissertation on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games\">video games</a>. So he played them instead, and smoked weed, and wrote comic strips and columns for a gaming magazine. He watched television, and he made the parody listings website <a href=\"http://www.ntk.net/tvgohome/121199.html\" title=\"\">TVGoHome</a> that held a mirror up to the medium, like a tailor saying: \u201cLook, Sir, Madam, look how absurd and grotesque you are.\u201d And he wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/oct/16/charlie-brooker-best-screen-burn\" title=\"\">the Screen Burn column for</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2010/oct/16/charlie-brooker-best-screen-burn\" title=\"\">the Guardian\u2019s Guide</a>, in which he did the same kind of thing in print.</p> <p>Then, as well as hating television, Brooker started to make it too. He wrote for Channel 4\u2019s The 11 O\u2019Clock Show, and for Chris Morris\u2019s brilliantly caustic spoof news show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jan/30/brass-eye-at-20-still-chris-morris-at-his-hysterical-gobsmacking-best\" title=\"\">Brass Eye</a>. With Morris, he wrote the hilarious series <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/10/nathan-barley-charlie-brooker-east-london-comedy\" title=\"\">Nathan Barley</a>, which managed to encapsulate everything that was ludicrous about the early 00s and was based on the TVGoHome entry Cunt. The Wipe shows followed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/15/charlie-brooker-screenwipe\" title=\"\">Screenwipe</a> (kind of Screen Burn on telly) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/19/newswipe-charlie-brooker\" title=\"\">Newswipe.</a></p> <p>Somewhere around 2000 he met Annabel Jones, then an executive at Endemol, which was buying a piece of Zeppotron, the production company Brooker had accidentally set up with other 11 O\u2019Clock Show writers but didn\u2019t know how to run (I think it\u2019s fair to say that running companies isn\u2019t high on Brooker\u2019s list of talents). They\u2019ve been working together ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be7b601b5d56746a1e49052a3211e68fdff5fc99\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be7b601b5d56746a1e49052a3211e68fdff5fc99/0_1097_4388_4388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Annabel Jones and Charlie Brooker\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019m more childish, you are sick\u2019 \u2026 Annabel Jones and Charlie Brooker</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Holyoak/Netflix/Black Mirror</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And now they are co-showrunners of Black Mirror, the anthology series that looks at the world \u2013 now and in about 10 minutes \u2013 its people and technology, and worries and laughs and screams about it \u2013 as do you, the viewer. It\u2019s as if Brooker, the writer, has stuck some kind of probe on your temple that reads your fears, and collates them into a cohesive story that is projected on to a screen that you have to watch. You want to watch, too, because it\u2019s funny, and human and about characters you care about (as well as about yourself, who, of course, you care about more than anyone else). And somewhere, perhaps in a cloud, or just a dark room, Charlie Brooker sits with a joystick, controlling your thoughts, laughing maniacally, possibly screaming as well.</p> <p>It all came about after Dead Set, a horror zombie satire Brooker and Jones made for Channel 4, that had nowhere to go because everyone had been killed off. Brooker and Jones talked about the lack of anthology shows on TV, that take an idea and explore it \u2013 and the world \u2013 in one episode. They imagined a kind of Twilight Zone for the age, dealing with relevant themes, and they pitched it to Channel 4. \u201cFoolishly they said yes,\u201d laughs Brooker.</p> <p>It started in December 2011 with three episodes, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/feb/06/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-box-set-review\" title=\"\">The National Anthem</a>, in which the British prime minister is forced to have sex with a pig on live TV by a man who has kidnapped a favourite member of the royal family. There was a further series and a Christmas special. Then Black Mirror and Channel 4 parted company, which might have been the end of it if it hadn\u2019t been picked up by Netflix, which has commissioned loads more, plus an experimental one-off-special, and has thrown money and love at it.</p> <p>What started as a seed almost four decades ago in the comic box of an Oxfordshire primary school, germinated for years in an imagination fed on horror and humour, telly and tech and computer games, has grown into something huge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41eea92e82d4d89c7ec131ffa1f64bbcd3a54905\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41eea92e82d4d89c7ec131ffa1f64bbcd3a54905/0_0_2835_1890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pig in a poke \u2026 Rory Kinnear starred in Black Mirror episode The National Anthem.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pig in a poke \u2026 Rory Kinnear starred in Black Mirror episode The National Anthem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Miller/Channel 4 Picture Publicity</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>We meet at Netflix</strong>\u2019s central London offices. Brooker, man of the moment, arrives with an entourage like Kanye West to whooping and hollering from the assembled staff \u2026 no, of course he doesn\u2019t. He shuffles out of the lift, bristly and pale in a tired looking T-shirt and hoodie, a man-child emerging from somewhere dark (like an edit suite, or the inside of his own head). Jones, 47, beside him, is as you would imagine a showrunner on a global TV series to be: presentable, groomed, articulate. She grew up in Pembrokeshire, not playing computer games, but watching telly \u2013 her early TV influences include Dennis Potter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/roald-dahl-day\" title=\"\">Tales of the Unexpected</a>. You can see echoes of Roald Dahl in a few BM episodes; the ones with a final rug-pull, such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2018/jan/03/black-mirror-season-four-step-away-from-your-smartphone-discuss-with-spoilers\" title=\"\">Crocodile</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You're not being judged on viewing figures, you're being judged on whether it creates a debate</p> <footer> <cite>Annabel jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We\u2019re shown to the boardroom, called Our Planet after the David Attenborough show, where there is a box of Queer Eye-branded tissues on the table and a big screen on the wall with a camera underneath, pointing at us. It\u2019s for video conferencing, but there is also something appropriately sinister about it. \u201cThis is going out live on Netflix, probably,\u201d says Brooker.</p> <p>They like working for Netflix, and not just because of the money it throws at them. \u201cYou\u2019re not being judged on the number of people watching a show, you\u2019re being judged on how interesting it is, how much people like it, whether it creates a debate,\u201d says Jones. In fact, they don\u2019t even get to know what the viewing figures are.</p> <p>She explains the problems with an anthology series for a traditional broadcaster: they\u2019re expensive, sets have to be built for each episode, ratings tend to decrease over a run because of the lack of cliffhangers or continuity of cast. That\u2019s what happened at Channel 4. It doesn\u2019t matter how much people love it or talk about it: rising costs and falling viewers is not a combo beloved by broadcasters.</p> <p>After the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/dec/17/black-mirror-white-christmas-great-british-bake-off\" title=\"\">White Christmas</a> one-off in December 2014, starring Jon Hamm, Brooker and Jones were in a state of limbo with Channel 4. They\u2019d gone to LA to try to get US networks to co-produce a third series, but they returned without a deal, their champion at Channel 4, Shane Allen, had gone to the BBC, and the station\u2019s bosses weren\u2019t offering another series.</p> <p>That\u2019s when Netflix, which already had the back-catalogue, stepped in. \u201cSuddenly those shows that are more word-of-mouth, and get talked about through friends or online rather than event-viewing, can prosper.\u201d says Jones. \u201cWe found ourselves in a bidding war with all the people who had just said they didn\u2019t want it and now realised they had to change their commissioning to compete with Netflix.\u201d Netflix, which has about 150 million subscribers, tends to win bidding wars, and did.</p> <p>I wonder what they now do differently for a global audience. Nothing, says Jones. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real worry that once you get commissioned for a global platform and try to make global shows, if you do that you are doomed, because then you are not making the film you have a personal experience of or affection for, and you start creating by numbers.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9opxsM73K48\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9opxsM73K48?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>A clip from San Junipero, the first Charlie Brooker-written episode made by Netflix</figcaption> </figure>   <p>One thing that has changed is that there has been a broadening of the range \u2013 of tone, genre and length. That was a deliberate decision brought about through necessity and because of the Netflix way of dumping a six-episode run all at once. If they\u2019d all ended as bleakly and nihilistically as the seven Channel 4 episodes had, it could have got boring and predictable as well as unrelentingly despairing. \u201cIt was a conscious decision on my part,\u201d says Brooker. \u201cThe first Netflix one I wrote, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/sep/16/black-mirror-first-look-review-charlie-brooker\" title=\"\">San Junipero,</a> is one of our most uplifting, positive ones.\u201d Also one of the most beautiful: a simulated-reality fairytale loaded with longing and despair, but in which love eventually overcomes loneliness.</p> <p>The diversity continued into the second Netflix series. Contrast <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/29/black-mirror-review-netflix-series-back-darker-charlie-brooker\" title=\"\">USS Callister</a>, a colourful high-concept romp, and Metalhead, which is basically half an hour in black and white of Maxine Peake being chased by a canine deathbot, and one of the tensest, most excruciating half-hours you\u2019re ever likely to spend. Metalhead is my own favourite. I still have nightmares about it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d92bc48ed35eb92fd93b6fc9d43fc3afc23f6c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d92bc48ed35eb92fd93b6fc9d43fc3afc23f6c1/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maxine Peake in Black Mirror: Metalhead.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maxine Peake in Black Mirror: Metalhead.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Prime/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDid you ever think, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t she just throw her coat over it?\u2019\u201d Brooker asks.

No, I didn\u2019t, but now I know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do when the time comes.</p> <p>Brooker and Jones sit on one side of the table, addressing each other as much as they do me. They\u2019re clearly close, more like siblings than work colleagues; siblings who share a world and get on but pretend that they don\u2019t, and bicker.</p> <p>How does it work between them, I want to know. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming it does work between us,\u201d says Brooker, cackling. He goes high-pitched when he gets animated, like he\u2019s gulped down a lungful of laughing gas. Is this squeaky, jovial goon really the force behind such brilliant dark beauty?</p> <p>I ask Jones to explain her role and Brooker interrupts. \u201cYeah, hang on, what <em>do</em> you do, who <em>are</em> you?\u201d</p> <p>She ignores him. \u201cWe have been working together for nearly 20 years, and I suppose there\u2019s a familiarity\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd therefore contempt.\u201d More giggling.</p> <p>\u201c... and disrespect between us that allows us to work very openly and candidly.\u201d And so it continues.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--showcase\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bVik34nWws\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2bVik34nWws?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bVik34nWws\">Watch a trailer for season 5 of Black Mirror</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Jones goes to the loo, I ask Brooker what she does. \u201cFuck knows, she couldn\u2019t explain could she?\u201d Later, he gives in to generosity. \u201cI\u2019m often trying to either appal or amuse or entertain you with an idea,\u201d he says, addressing her. \u201cAnd you will say, \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 And you will sort of drag more of it out of me. Or sometimes you\u2019ll put up blocks and say, \u2018Well that wouldn\u2019t work because\u2026\u2019 and I\u2019ll go \u2018Yeah but\u2026\u2019 and that sort of leads to a conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Jones is the first person to see the first draft of any script. They\u2019ll work on it together before showing it to anyone else. She has a sicker sense of humour than he does, Brooker says. \u201cYou don\u2019t like scatology, and the more you dislike it the further I go. I\u2019m more childish, you are sick.\u201d</p> <p>Slowly, amid all the needling and \u2013 horrid word alert \u2013 banter, I\u2019m getting some idea of how it works. While he is the creative force behind Black Mirror, she is the facilitator, the sounding board, as well as the grownup in the room if there are other people in it. Television executive people, for example. It\u2019s probably fair to say Black Mirror would never have seen the light of day without Annabel Jones. Perhaps it\u2019s her with the joystick, cackling ... except that she\u2019s not into video games.</p> <p>Are they friends? \u201cI would say so,\u201d says Brooker, faux reluctantly.</p> <p>Do their partners get jealous? \u201cOh my God, they are grateful,\u201d says Jones. Grateful that it keeps them out of the house. Brooker agrees.</p> <p><strong>The last episode</strong> \u2013 Jones rather grandly refers to them as films, though to be fair they have become more cinematic with Netflix\u2019s financial might \u2013 was Bandersnatch. It was ... or is, as there is no past tense on Netflix ... interactive. So you, the viewer get to make decisions for the main character, a young programmer in 1980s Croydon. It\u2019s an extraordinary achievement, groundbreaking even. Not just because of the logistical nightmare of making decision-tree television, but also because it throws up problems such as how do you create a proper, real character when you\u2019re handing over a lot of the stuff that would make him a character (decision-making) to everyone else?</p> <p>Bandersnatch overcomes the hurdles ingeniously. But for some of us traditional old farts who don\u2019t want our television in kit form, it was just a bit too frumious. It\u2019s been a long day, you want to put your feet up and watch something, you don\u2019t want to torment someone in 1984. \u201cThe tricky thing is, it\u2019s its own genre, like musicals, and some people don\u2019t like musicals no matter what. Some people don\u2019t want to make decisions, and that\u2019s fair enough,\u201d says Brooker. Before adding, inevitably, that they ... we ... can fuck off.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c08128358ce5eacbd10f8d92de608724c6fb989c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c08128358ce5eacbd10f8d92de608724c6fb989c/30_110_3810_1905/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Black Mirror: Bandersnatch offered viewers choices in how the story developed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black Mirror: Bandersnatch offered viewers choices in how the story developed.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s no decision-making to be done in the three new episodes that land on 5 June.

It's about human failures</p> <footer> <cite>Annabel Jones</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the tech and tech-related issues, think not far off \u2013 10 minutes into the future if we\u2019re not already. There are Alexas and smart speakers, next-level gaming (amazing gaming, and I\u2019m not a gamer), gaming nostalgia, next-level porn, current-level social media, social media founders and CEOs, and digital data rights after death.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a show about technology though, says Jones. \u201cI always get frustrated when people say it is. The stories are hopefully entertaining, very intimate stories about human failures and dilemmas.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe very rarely go: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve read this news report and Samsung has invented a fridge that sings to you while you eat yoghurt,\u2019\u201d says Brooker. \u201cNo, that would be a terrible basis for an episode. It tends to be: wouldn\u2019t it be weird if\u2026\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s not denying the importance of tech to Black Mirror. \u201cThere is always a technological explanation for what is going on in our episodes \u2013 that\u2019s what differentiates us from something like The Twilight Zone, where it is the supernatural or the uncanny or the unexplained.\u201d</p> <p>He mentions a <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734590/\" title=\"\">famous Twilight Zone episode</a> in which a woman goes into bus station and sees an identical copy of herself, which is not explained. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do that. We\u2019d have to come up with she\u2019s in VR or she\u2019s a clone. But that\u2019s the only real difference. People didn\u2019t say to Rod Serling [The Twilight Zone\u2019s creator], what\u2019s the show about magic and ghosts and aliens you\u2019re doing, what is it about aliens that fascinates you so much? It was clear that that wasn\u2019t what The Twilight Zone was about. I think it\u2019s similar with Black Mirror: we are doing a supernatural show that has no supernatural element in it, and using that to tell stories that entertain, and that put people in really unusual situations and dilemmas that you can\u2019t see elsewhere. That\u2019s really what we are trying to do.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31a36c91b478297609dab5bc164c33969088f16e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31a36c91b478297609dab5bc164c33969088f16e/38_0_1453_872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miley Cyrus stars in the new series of Black Mirror: Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miley Cyrus stars in the new series of Black Mirror: Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix / Black Mirror</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What kind of criticism of BM gets his goat? \u201cI guess if people take it too seriously, or think it takes itself too seriously. Or when people say \u2018I want to do something like that, but with a sense of humour.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Actually Brooker doesn\u2019t seem to be very angry about much. It is almost disappointing, when frothing apoplectic rage is what he is \u2013 or certainly was \u2013 famous for. \u201cWhen I was doing columns, and doing the Wipe shows, that was me to an extent playing a character. TVGoHome was abrasive stuff, but it\u2019s in character, sort of.\u201d</p> <p>What would 20 years ago Charlie Brooker, furious in his bedsit, think of new Charlie Brooker, successful, sunny and sweet? No he\u2019s not having sunny and sweet. \u201cI think I\u2019m quite goonish, probably more goonish than I would portray in print, and probably more stupid.\u201d</p> <p>But to answer the question, he would have been astounded, he says. \u201cThat I would have been doing a show that people could see all over the place. I\u2019d probably be pleased, yeah definitely pleased. I wonder if I\u2019d like \u2026 yeah, I reckon I\u2019d be into the show, that would be weird.\u201d</p> <p>Having kids has affected his world outlook, it can\u2019t not have done. \u201cBecause you drop down the hierarchy in your own head, so you worry less about ephemeral things and more about, \u2018Oh shit, what is the world going to be like?\u2019 Now I worry less \u2018Am I going to get incinerated in a nuclear fireball?\u2019 and more \u2018Is that going to happen to my children?\u2019. Or, \u2018Which of my children am I going to have to kill in the bunker, when there\u2019s no way out?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the five-year-old,\u201d says Jones. Yeah, mummy\u2019s boy.</p> <p>Fire and no way out is a recurring worry it seems. I ask about the immense wealth that must have resulted from having a global hit, does that not help the outlook? \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to swan around in yachts or anything like that,\u201d says Brooker. He doesn\u2019t look like a yachter to be fair. He has bought a pinball machine, the best pinball machine you can get, he admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t walk around going we do this big successful show and blah blah blah, probably because we are\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cToo busy making it,\u201d says Jones.</p> <p>\u201cAnd too fucked up. Speaking for myself there\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, speak for yourself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBecause I genuinely think if someone gives you an award or something, I think, \u2018Ugh, this is heavy, or I\u2019m not going to win one next year\u2019, or \u2018Oh God, what if someone shoots me from the audience, where are the exits, what if this building catches fire?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>OK, so sunny was wrong. Is he happy at least? \u201cErm, is anyone? Generally, I have my moments.\u201d</p> <p>What about the future of the show? \u201cI think, because we can keep on reinventing it, there is no shortage of ideas.\u201d he says. It would be hard to do an Airplane!-style comedy episode of Black Mirror, though he wanted to and has had to be talked out of it. Or a documentary episode, though they have discussed that too. \u201cBut other than that, if I look at the ones we have done, I think the tone of them is wildly different, so hopefully we can just keep doing them. Until the robots take over. Which will happen. One afternoon\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70264888\">Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "During the recent school holidays, Charlie Brooker made a deal with his seven-year-old son. \u201cI said, \u2018Right, you\u2019ve got these tests coming up\u2019 (these stupid SAT things),\u201d he tells me. \u201cI had a book of mock exams and I said, \u2018If you do one of these every morning, half an hour, maths or English, then you can do whatever the fuck you want the rest of the day.\u2019\u201d Actually he didn\u2019t swear, Brooker adds. And what did Brooker Jr want to do for the rest of the day? Play video games. He likes the ones where you create levels and customise characters, like Super Mario Maker. \u201cIf anything, he\u2019s more into computer games than I am, which is a statement I didn\u2019t think it was possible to utter,\u201d his dad, 48, tells me, not unproudly. It was a good deal, that worked for both of them. \u201cI assuaged parental guilt by making him sit an exam, he got to play computer games all day long, so it meant I could also do what the fuck I wanted.\u201d Brooker\u2019s other child, five, is \u2013 disappointingly \u2013 less into gaming. Less into Dad too (\u201cI don\u2019t want you, I want Mummy,\u201d he shouts when he hurts himself) but that\u2019s by-the-by and possibly not for ever. \u201cHe wants to watch little bastards opening presents on YouTube, that\u2019s his jam,\u201d says Brooker, before adding that the jam phrase is not one he has used before. He does that sometimes, stepping aside from himself to have a listen to what is spewing from his mouth: is that good, bad, or just surprising, he seems to ask himself. Does he make any attempts to limit the kids\u2019 screen time I wonder. \u201cI mean you try to a bit, but I don\u2019t worry too much about that because I sort of think by the time they\u2019re grown up the only job left will be robot polishing,\u201d he says. \u201cSo they might as well enjoy themselves and get used to clicking things. I kind of think as long as they\u2019re happy \u2026 I have heard myself saying: \u2018It\u2019s a lovely day outside, come on,\u2019 which was my parents\u2019 theme tune I remember in the summer holiday. \u2018What are you doing sitting indoors, playing on the Spectrum? It\u2019s sunny!\u2019\u201d Brooker grew up in the village of Brightwell-cum-Sotwell in Oxfordshire. An early portent of what lay ahead was a comic he made himself, filled with violence, anger and jokes, and then sneaked into his primary school comic box. At home his dad showed him repeats of Monty Python, and Charlie liked watching things like Not the Nine O\u2019Clock News, Spitting Image, The Young Ones. \u201cGenerally speaking, shows that were tinkering about with the format. I remember seeing Airplane! in the cinema and thinking, \u2018I didn\u2019t know they made films like that, that\u2019s the best film ever made!\u2019 When I was a bit older I would stay up and catch The Twilight Zone. I always liked nasty, twist-in-the-tale type stories as well \u2013 Hammer House of Horror is another one, because it had this horrible British sensibility, so it looked like a sitcom but there were people being stabbed in the neck with trowels. Stuff that broke the fourth wall, was anarchic, The Young Ones, stuff that had a strong flavour.\u201d Around about the same time, at the local leisure centre, he discovered the first arcade games, such as Space Invaders and Pac-Man. \u201cAnd thinking you can control that, that\u2019s interesting.\u201d Brooker now has a vintage arcade game at home. He didn\u2019t get a degree; Central London Poly didn\u2019t want his dissertation on video games. So he played them instead, and smoked weed, and wrote comic strips and columns for a gaming magazine. He watched television, and he made the parody listings website TVGoHome that held a mirror up to the medium, like a tailor saying: \u201cLook, Sir, Madam, look how absurd and grotesque you are.\u201d And he wrote the Screen Burn column for the Guardian\u2019s Guide, in which he did the same kind of thing in print. Then, as well as hating television, Brooker started to make it too. He wrote for Channel 4\u2019s The 11 O\u2019Clock Show, and for Chris Morris\u2019s brilliantly caustic spoof news show Brass Eye. With Morris, he wrote the hilarious series Nathan Barley, which managed to encapsulate everything that was ludicrous about the early 00s and was based on the TVGoHome entry Cunt. The Wipe shows followed \u2013 Screenwipe (kind of Screen Burn on telly) and Newswipe. Somewhere around 2000 he met Annabel Jones, then an executive at Endemol, which was buying a piece of Zeppotron, the production company Brooker had accidentally set up with other 11 O\u2019Clock Show writers but didn\u2019t know how to run (I think it\u2019s fair to say that running companies isn\u2019t high on Brooker\u2019s list of talents). They\u2019ve been working together ever since. And now they are co-showrunners of Black Mirror, the anthology series that looks at the world \u2013 now and in about 10 minutes \u2013 its people and technology, and worries and laughs and screams about it \u2013 as do you, the viewer. It\u2019s as if Brooker, the writer, has stuck some kind of probe on your temple that reads your fears, and collates them into a cohesive story that is projected on to a screen that you have to watch. You want to watch, too, because it\u2019s funny, and human and about characters you care about (as well as about yourself, who, of course, you care about more than anyone else). And somewhere, perhaps in a cloud, or just a dark room, Charlie Brooker sits with a joystick, controlling your thoughts, laughing maniacally, possibly screaming as well. It all came about after Dead Set, a horror zombie satire Brooker and Jones made for Channel 4, that had nowhere to go because everyone had been killed off. Brooker and Jones talked about the lack of anthology shows on TV, that take an idea and explore it \u2013 and the world \u2013 in one episode. They imagined a kind of Twilight Zone for the age, dealing with relevant themes, and they pitched it to Channel 4. \u201cFoolishly they said yes,\u201d laughs Brooker. It started in December 2011 with three episodes, including The National Anthem, in which the British prime minister is forced to have sex with a pig on live TV by a man who has kidnapped a favourite member of the royal family. There was a further series and a Christmas special. Then Black Mirror and Channel 4 parted company, which might have been the end of it if it hadn\u2019t been picked up by Netflix, which has commissioned loads more, plus an experimental one-off-special, and has thrown money and love at it. What started as a seed almost four decades ago in the comic box of an Oxfordshire primary school, germinated for years in an imagination fed on horror and humour, telly and tech and computer games, has grown into something huge. We meet at Netflix\u2019s central London offices. Brooker, man of the moment, arrives with an entourage like Kanye West to whooping and hollering from the assembled staff \u2026 no, of course he doesn\u2019t. He shuffles out of the lift, bristly and pale in a tired looking T-shirt and hoodie, a man-child emerging from somewhere dark (like an edit suite, or the inside of his own head). Jones, 47, beside him, is as you would imagine a showrunner on a global TV series to be: presentable, groomed, articulate. She grew up in Pembrokeshire, not playing computer games, but watching telly \u2013 her early TV influences include Dennis Potter and Tales of the Unexpected. You can see echoes of Roald Dahl in a few BM episodes; the ones with a final rug-pull, such as Crocodile. We\u2019re shown to the boardroom, called Our Planet after the David Attenborough show, where there is a box of Queer Eye-branded tissues on the table and a big screen on the wall with a camera underneath, pointing at us. It\u2019s for video conferencing, but there is also something appropriately sinister about it. \u201cThis is going out live on Netflix, probably,\u201d says Brooker. They like working for Netflix, and not just because of the money it throws at them. \u201cYou\u2019re not being judged on the number of people watching a show, you\u2019re being judged on how interesting it is, how much people like it, whether it creates a debate,\u201d says Jones. In fact, they don\u2019t even get to know what the viewing figures are. She explains the problems with an anthology series for a traditional broadcaster: they\u2019re expensive, sets have to be built for each episode, ratings tend to decrease over a run because of the lack of cliffhangers or continuity of cast. That\u2019s what happened at Channel 4. It doesn\u2019t matter how much people love it or talk about it: rising costs and falling viewers is not a combo beloved by broadcasters. After the White Christmas one-off in December 2014, starring Jon Hamm, Brooker and Jones were in a state of limbo with Channel 4. They\u2019d gone to LA to try to get US networks to co-produce a third series, but they returned without a deal, their champion at Channel 4, Shane Allen, had gone to the BBC, and the station\u2019s bosses weren\u2019t offering another series. That\u2019s when Netflix, which already had the back-catalogue, stepped in. \u201cSuddenly those shows that are more word-of-mouth, and get talked about through friends or online rather than event-viewing, can prosper.\u201d says Jones. \u201cWe found ourselves in a bidding war with all the people who had just said they didn\u2019t want it and now realised they had to change their commissioning to compete with Netflix.\u201d Netflix, which has about 150 million subscribers, tends to win bidding wars, and did. I wonder what they now do differently for a global audience. Nothing, says Jones. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real worry that once you get commissioned for a global platform and try to make global shows, if you do that you are doomed, because then you are not making the film you have a personal experience of or affection for, and you start creating by numbers.\u201d One thing that has changed is that there has been a broadening of the range \u2013 of tone, genre and length. That was a deliberate decision brought about through necessity and because of the Netflix way of dumping a six-episode run all at once. If they\u2019d all ended as bleakly and nihilistically as the seven Channel 4 episodes had, it could have got boring and predictable as well as unrelentingly despairing. \u201cIt was a conscious decision on my part,\u201d says Brooker. \u201cThe first Netflix one I wrote, San Junipero, is one of our most uplifting, positive ones.\u201d Also one of the most beautiful: a simulated-reality fairytale loaded with longing and despair, but in which love eventually overcomes loneliness. The diversity continued into the second Netflix series. Contrast USS Callister, a colourful high-concept romp, and Metalhead, which is basically half an hour in black and white of Maxine Peake being chased by a canine deathbot, and one of the tensest, most excruciating half-hours you\u2019re ever likely to spend. Metalhead is my own favourite. I still have nightmares about it. \u201cDid you ever think, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t she just throw her coat over it?\u2019\u201d Brooker asks. He means to stop the guard dog robot solar-recharging while Peake is up the tree. Someone had pointed this option out to him. No, I didn\u2019t, but now I know, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do when the time comes. Brooker and Jones sit on one side of the table, addressing each other as much as they do me. They\u2019re clearly close, more like siblings than work colleagues; siblings who share a world and get on but pretend that they don\u2019t, and bicker. How does it work between them, I want to know. \u201cThat\u2019s assuming it does work between us,\u201d says Brooker, cackling. He goes high-pitched when he gets animated, like he\u2019s gulped down a lungful of laughing gas. Is this squeaky, jovial goon really the force behind such brilliant dark beauty? I ask Jones to explain her role and Brooker interrupts. \u201cYeah, hang on, what do you do, who are you?\u201d She ignores him. \u201cWe have been working together for nearly 20 years, and I suppose there\u2019s a familiarity\u2026\u201d \u201cAnd therefore contempt.\u201d More giggling. \u201c... and disrespect between us that allows us to work very openly and candidly.\u201d And so it continues. When Jones goes to the loo, I ask Brooker what she does. \u201cFuck knows, she couldn\u2019t explain could she?\u201d Later, he gives in to generosity. \u201cI\u2019m often trying to either appal or amuse or entertain you with an idea,\u201d he says, addressing her. \u201cAnd you will say, \u2018What do you mean by that?\u2019 And you will sort of drag more of it out of me. Or sometimes you\u2019ll put up blocks and say, \u2018Well that wouldn\u2019t work because\u2026\u2019 and I\u2019ll go \u2018Yeah but\u2026\u2019 and that sort of leads to a conversation.\u201d Jones is the first person to see the first draft of any script. They\u2019ll work on it together before showing it to anyone else. She has a sicker sense of humour than he does, Brooker says. \u201cYou don\u2019t like scatology, and the more you dislike it the further I go. I\u2019m more childish, you are sick.\u201d Slowly, amid all the needling and \u2013 horrid word alert \u2013 banter, I\u2019m getting some idea of how it works. While he is the creative force behind Black Mirror, she is the facilitator, the sounding board, as well as the grownup in the room if there are other people in it. Television executive people, for example. It\u2019s probably fair to say Black Mirror would never have seen the light of day without Annabel Jones. Perhaps it\u2019s her with the joystick, cackling ... except that she\u2019s not into video games. Are they friends? \u201cI would say so,\u201d says Brooker, faux reluctantly. Do their partners get jealous? \u201cOh my God, they are grateful,\u201d says Jones. Grateful that it keeps them out of the house. Brooker agrees. The last episode \u2013 Jones rather grandly refers to them as films, though to be fair they have become more cinematic with Netflix\u2019s financial might \u2013 was Bandersnatch. It was ... or is, as there is no past tense on Netflix ... interactive. So you, the viewer get to make decisions for the main character, a young programmer in 1980s Croydon. It\u2019s an extraordinary achievement, groundbreaking even. Not just because of the logistical nightmare of making decision-tree television, but also because it throws up problems such as how do you create a proper, real character when you\u2019re handing over a lot of the stuff that would make him a character (decision-making) to everyone else? Bandersnatch overcomes the hurdles ingeniously. But for some of us traditional old farts who don\u2019t want our television in kit form, it was just a bit too frumious. It\u2019s been a long day, you want to put your feet up and watch something, you don\u2019t want to torment someone in 1984. \u201cThe tricky thing is, it\u2019s its own genre, like musicals, and some people don\u2019t like musicals no matter what. Some people don\u2019t want to make decisions, and that\u2019s fair enough,\u201d says Brooker. Before adding, inevitably, that they ... we ... can fuck off. There\u2019s no decision-making to be done in the three new episodes that land on 5 June. I\u2019ve seen them and they\u2019re fabulous, in different ways. I can\u2019t tell you too much, obviously, or they\u2019ll set the death-bots on me. But I can probably mention some of the themes that come out of them \u2013 ageing, long-term friendship, long-term relationships, commitment, pornography and reality, fantasy fulfilment, unfaithfulness, death, grief ... God it sounds bleak, but it\u2019s not all bleak, there is light and laughter as well. And Miley Cyrus is in one! She is great, in a starring role that is very personal to her and draws on her own experience, without giving too much away ... and there\u2019s a Miley Cyrus robot. For the tech and tech-related issues, think not far off \u2013 10 minutes into the future if we\u2019re not already. There are Alexas and smart speakers, next-level gaming (amazing gaming, and I\u2019m not a gamer), gaming nostalgia, next-level porn, current-level social media, social media founders and CEOs, and digital data rights after death. It\u2019s not a show about technology though, says Jones. \u201cI always get frustrated when people say it is. The stories are hopefully entertaining, very intimate stories about human failures and dilemmas.\u201d \u201cWe very rarely go: \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve read this news report and Samsung has invented a fridge that sings to you while you eat yoghurt,\u2019\u201d says Brooker. \u201cNo, that would be a terrible basis for an episode. It tends to be: wouldn\u2019t it be weird if\u2026\u201d He\u2019s not denying the importance of tech to Black Mirror. \u201cThere is always a technological explanation for what is going on in our episodes \u2013 that\u2019s what differentiates us from something like The Twilight Zone, where it is the supernatural or the uncanny or the unexplained.\u201d He mentions a famous Twilight Zone episode in which a woman goes into bus station and sees an identical copy of herself, which is not explained. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t do that. We\u2019d have to come up with she\u2019s in VR or she\u2019s a clone. But that\u2019s the only real difference. People didn\u2019t say to Rod Serling [The Twilight Zone\u2019s creator], what\u2019s the show about magic and ghosts and aliens you\u2019re doing, what is it about aliens that fascinates you so much? It was clear that that wasn\u2019t what The Twilight Zone was about. I think it\u2019s similar with Black Mirror: we are doing a supernatural show that has no supernatural element in it, and using that to tell stories that entertain, and that put people in really unusual situations and dilemmas that you can\u2019t see elsewhere. That\u2019s really what we are trying to do.\u201d What kind of criticism of BM gets his goat? \u201cI guess if people take it too seriously, or think it takes itself too seriously. Or when people say \u2018I want to do something like that, but with a sense of humour.\u2019 I\u2019m like: \u2018For fuck\u2019s sake, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019\u201d Actually Brooker doesn\u2019t seem to be very angry about much. It is almost disappointing, when frothing apoplectic rage is what he is \u2013 or certainly was \u2013 famous for. \u201cWhen I was doing columns, and doing the Wipe shows, that was me to an extent playing a character. TVGoHome was abrasive stuff, but it\u2019s in character, sort of.\u201d What would 20 years ago Charlie Brooker, furious in his bedsit, think of new Charlie Brooker, successful, sunny and sweet? No he\u2019s not having sunny and sweet. \u201cI think I\u2019m quite goonish, probably more goonish than I would portray in print, and probably more stupid.\u201d But to answer the question, he would have been astounded, he says. \u201cThat I would have been doing a show that people could see all over the place. I\u2019d probably be pleased, yeah definitely pleased. I wonder if I\u2019d like \u2026 yeah, I reckon I\u2019d be into the show, that would be weird.\u201d Having kids has affected his world outlook, it can\u2019t not have done. \u201cBecause you drop down the hierarchy in your own head, so you worry less about ephemeral things and more about, \u2018Oh shit, what is the world going to be like?\u2019 Now I worry less \u2018Am I going to get incinerated in a nuclear fireball?\u2019 and more \u2018Is that going to happen to my children?\u2019. Or, \u2018Which of my children am I going to have to kill in the bunker, when there\u2019s no way out?\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the five-year-old,\u201d says Jones. Yeah, mummy\u2019s boy. Fire and no way out is a recurring worry it seems. I ask about the immense wealth that must have resulted from having a global hit, does that not help the outlook? \u201cWe don\u2019t tend to swan around in yachts or anything like that,\u201d says Brooker. He doesn\u2019t look like a yachter to be fair. He has bought a pinball machine, the best pinball machine you can get, he admits. \u201cWe don\u2019t walk around going we do this big successful show and blah blah blah, probably because we are\u2026\u201d \u201cToo busy making it,\u201d says Jones. \u201cAnd too fucked up. Speaking for myself there\u2026\u201d \u201cYeah, speak for yourself.\u201d \u201cBecause I genuinely think if someone gives you an award or something, I think, \u2018Ugh, this is heavy, or I\u2019m not going to win one next year\u2019, or \u2018Oh God, what if someone shoots me from the audience, where are the exits, what if this building catches fire?\u2019\u201d OK, so sunny was wrong. Is he happy at least? \u201cErm, is anyone? Generally, I have my moments.\u201d What about the future of the show? \u201cI think, because we can keep on reinventing it, there is no shortage of ideas.\u201d he says. It would be hard to do an Airplane!-style comedy episode of Black Mirror, though he wanted to and has had to be talked out of it. Or a documentary episode, though they have discussed that too. \u201cBut other than that, if I look at the ones we have done, I think the tone of them is wildly different, so hopefully we can just keep doing them. Until the robots take over. Which will happen. One afternoon\u2026\u201d \u2022 Black Mirror season 5 launches on Netflix on 5 June.",

      "body": "<p>Three weeks ago, on a cold and damp morning, I met the tortoise as I was crossing the garden between my office shed and the kitchen. He was making a concerted effort to get indoors, but found himself stuck halfway up the step, rocking gently on the fulcrum of the brick\u2019s edge. His back legs were scrabbling to push his undercarriage far enough forward for his front legs to get some purchase, to no avail. As I approached, he fixed me with a severe look that said: your climate sucks, by the way.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not from here,\u201d I said.</p> <p>I knew his determination would eventually see him gain the step, and the one above it, because I once watched the whole grim process on a slow afternoon. But he would ultimately be defeated by the doorway\u2019s overhanging threshold. I picked him up and set him on the kitchen floor.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said. He crawled under the dog\u2019s bed, retracted his limbs and wound his neck in.</p> <p>When the weather became more seasonable, he returned himself to the outdoors. I know from experience that approximately one in 10 of his attempts to descend the kitchen steps ends with him upside down, but he must have got it right this time.</p> <p>His summer residence is a hollow under the garden wall, between a gnarled ivy root and the trunk of a cherry tree. He discovered it himself and made his own improvements, digging a little deeper to extend the space. That\u2019s where he normally spends his nights, but on warm days he\u2019s up before I am, and already well into his daily routine of destruction. I find him sunning himself on a patch of bare earth.</p> <p>\u201cDidn\u2019t there used to be a big plant there?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d</p> <p>On Friday I see my wife striding across the garden towards my office.

      "bodyText": "Three weeks ago, on a cold and damp morning, I met the tortoise as I was crossing the garden between my office shed and the kitchen. He was making a concerted effort to get indoors, but found himself stuck halfway up the step, rocking gently on the fulcrum of the brick\u2019s edge. His back legs were scrabbling to push his undercarriage far enough forward for his front legs to get some purchase, to no avail. As I approached, he fixed me with a severe look that said: your climate sucks, by the way. \u201cI\u2019m not from here,\u201d I said. I knew his determination would eventually see him gain the step, and the one above it, because I once watched the whole grim process on a slow afternoon. But he would ultimately be defeated by the doorway\u2019s overhanging threshold. I picked him up and set him on the kitchen floor. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d I said. He crawled under the dog\u2019s bed, retracted his limbs and wound his neck in. When the weather became more seasonable, he returned himself to the outdoors. I know from experience that approximately one in 10 of his attempts to descend the kitchen steps ends with him upside down, but he must have got it right this time. His summer residence is a hollow under the garden wall, between a gnarled ivy root and the trunk of a cherry tree. He discovered it himself and made his own improvements, digging a little deeper to extend the space. That\u2019s where he normally spends his nights, but on warm days he\u2019s up before I am, and already well into his daily routine of destruction. I find him sunning himself on a patch of bare earth. \u201cDidn\u2019t there used to be a big plant there?\u201d I say. \u201cWhat have you done?\u201d On Friday I see my wife striding across the garden towards my office. I change my computer screen to something that looks like work, but she stops halfway and turns. \u201cYou bastard!\u201d she says, bending over. She crouches over the bed and lifts the tortoise out of some foliage. Feathery green fronds hang from his chin. My wife carries him to the door of my office and holds him out, his four legs swiping at the air. \u201cYou can\u2019t just let him eat my things,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m a businessman,\u201d I say, typing. I do not mention that I just spent 20 minutes watching leaves dip and shudder as the tortoise tunnelled through the border directly towards the bush she bought from B&amp;Q the day before, all the while thinking: how curious. \u201cI just planted that,\u201d she says. \u201cDid you leave the price tag on it?\u201d I say. \u201cI think that\u2019s how he knows.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not funny,\u201d she says. \u201cI gave him some lettuce this morning,\u201d I say. \u201cBut he ignored it and ate the grass around it. He knows what he likes.\u201d My wife turns the tortoise so it\u2019s facing her. \u201cI\u2019m going to trap you under the washing machine,\u201d she says. The tortoise blinks and stares down at the ground with a look that says: like hell you will.

His work, Twitter, and the peaks and troughs of Nadine Coyle\u2019s career. Any awkward moments? Discovering he follows a group of my friends on social media, though this didn\u2019t make me awkward: it was just surreal. Good table manners? Exquisite. Best thing about Adam? He can hold a conversation really well, and seems to be genuinely passionate about his job. Would you introduce him to your friends? He already knows of some of them through the power of the internet, so why not? Describe Adam in three words? Friendly, warm and talkative. What do you think he made of you? Probably that I have too much to say for myself. Did you go on somewhere? No. And... did you kiss? Momentarily, yes \u2013 largely for the purpose of this question!

      "body": "<p>Last week, popular fashion patternmaker Papercut Patterns posted a short video on Instagram of one of their patterns being reprinted. The clip was just long enough to see the name of the pattern, the Kochi jacket, passing through the rollers.</p> <p>Three weeks ago, that pattern had a different name. The square-cut short jacket, with optional side ties, was released in June 2017 with the name Kochi Kimono. For 18 months, amateur sewers \u2014 most prefer the term \u201csewist\u201d, for reasons of homonym \u2014 had been making their own versions and sharing the results on Instagram tagged with #Kochikimono.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/29/cultural-appropriation-racial-oppression-exploitation-colonialism\">Why we need to pause before claiming cultural appropriation | Ash Sarkar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, on 13 May, Asian-American woman Helen Kim<strong> </strong> replied to a new photo of the garment to say that to call it a kimono, without any connection beyond a certain boxiness about the sleeves to the traditional Japanese garment, was cultural appropriation.</p> <p>The post blew up. Those who agreed with Kim were accused of conducting a witch hunt against a female-owned company; those who rejected it were accused of racism. Japanese-American woman Emi Ito, a campaigner against cultural appropriation, was tagged in. She and Kim were suddenly fielding racist commentary on their own accounts.</p> <p>The debate spread rapidly through Instagram stories, an ephemeral medium that allows users to post photos and videos of up to 15-second in length in short, ever-scrolling clips that will disappear after 24-hours. It was waged in long, impossible-to-follow comment threads under Instagram posts until Papercut Patterns deleted the post and closed comments on subsequent posts, sparking another wave of criticism. The same failings that made Instagram a difficult platform for lengthy debate made it the perfect vehicle for outrage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/Bxa-JHvAvfI/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

This was kindly brought to our attention by email and comments on our Instagram posts, which we took to heart and based our research on, and we have now acted on this error and changed the name.  We have apologised for any hurt caused, and we apologise again to those who feel that it took us too long to make these amendments.  Mistakes happen unfortunately, we\u2019re all human, and we can only apologise and learn from the experience. At this point, it is hard to know what is the right thing to do; again, we are trying our best.  By turning off comments, we are not silencing anyone, but hoping to prevent people lashing out on each other. We chose to turn off ALL comments as we felt that the conversation was getting out of control and hurtful to many. We have zero tolerance for racism, nor for hatred towards others. **statement continued in next post**</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/papercutpatterns/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Papercut Patterns</a> (@papercutpatterns) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-05-13T23:37:49+00:00\">May 13, 2019 at 4:37pm PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>The 16-hour time difference between New Zealand, where the small company is based, and the United States, where most of the angst was coming from, made the company appear slow to respond.</p> <p>\u201cIt was just a shitshow,\u201d says Mary Rockcastle.</p> <p>Rockcastle is a sewing blogger based in New York State, writing at <a href=\"http://sablecraft.com/\">Sablecraft</a>. She watched it unfold from afar. The one-sided nature of Instagram meant that if you were not following bloggers from different social and cultural backgrounds, you were only seeing half the story.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re only looking at it from one point of view, as a person who is just following Papercut Patterns, you\u2019re like: what could this pattern company possibly be doing, to be fucking up this bad?\u201d</p> <p>Instagram is the network of choice for at-home sewists and knitters who are looking to show off their handiwork and the community is growing rapidly as consumers look for more sustainable and ethical alternatives to fast fashion. A scroll through the most popular accounts shows a familiar Instagram aesthetic: slim, mainly white women in their 20s and 30s, wearing dramatic woollen or linen shapes.</p> <p>It is particularly active during May, where the month-long #MeMadeMay challenge encourages sewists to post daily selfies showing off their self-made outfits.</p> <p>Suddenly, everyone was talking about the Kochi kimono.</p> <p>Ito is a teacher and ethical fashion advocate, on Instagram at <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/little_kotos_closet/?hl=en\">@little_kotos_closet</a>. In January she <a href=\"https://densho.org/my-kimono-is-not-your-couture/\">wrote a much-cited article about the cultural appropriation of kimonos</a>, writing about the significance of her family\u2019s kimonos as cultural items and urging designers to consider if another name might work.</p> <p>She was one of a number blocked from the Instagram page, after being tagged by the company in a follow-up post.</p> <p> Kim told the Guardian she did not expect small businesses to be perfect, but did expect they would react to criticism with \u201cempathy and awareness\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Papercut Patterns deleted my comments and blocked BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and people of colour] accounts who called for change, they demonstrated what can go wrong when a company fails to demonstrate empathy in rectifying a racially insensitive mistake,\u201d Kim says. \u201cCompanies that label themselves as ethical/inclusive/sustainable have an obligation to take responsibility for the harm they inflict, to mitigate that harm, to address how their mistakes are at odds with their values, and to proactively support inclusivity beyond public relations.\u201d</p> <p>This process, Kim says, is \u201cemotionally and intellectually labour-intensive for the marginalised\u201d who challenge companies on \u201ccultural and racial harm,\u201d but is often \u201ctwisted into a business\u2019s redemption story rather than a visible change in practice and awareness.\u201d</p> <p>It took one day for Papercut Patterns to promise to rename the garment and one week for that video of the newly printed Kochi jacket patterns to appear. Bookending that story, saved to their <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/papercutpatterns/\">Instagram page</a>, is a statement from director Katie Romagnoli.</p> <p>\u201cI want to thank everyone who let us know the mistake we made in giving one of our patterns a culturally sensitive name,\u201d she says.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been plenty of important conversation on my last post, and I have truly appreciated the chance to listen and learn \u2026 Thank you everyone. I will be continuing my own education.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Papercut Patterns but did not receive a response.</p> <p>It was the second reckoning over racial and cultural insensitivity to rock the craft community this year. The knitters got there first.</p> <p>On 7 January, Karen Templer, a knitwear designer, <a href=\"https://fringeassociation.com/2019/01/07/2019-my-year-of-color/\">published a blog</a> about a planned trip to India and likened her excitement and personal anxiety about going, in an offhand line, to visiting Mars.</p> <p>It was widely panned. The post was called othering and imperialistic; her descriptions of India \u201cdeeply racist and reductive\u201d.</p> <p>Templar apologised in <a href=\"https://fringeassociation.com/2019/01/07/2019-my-year-of-color/#comment-87070\">a comment on her original post</a>, and in a second post five days later titled <a href=\"https://fringeassociation.com/2019/01/12/words-matter/\">\u201cwords matter\u201d</a> .</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss both these debates and the very existence of Instagram-based knitting and sewing communities as trivial. Is this what political correctness has wrought: a culture war in knitting?</p> <p>Until the rise of Instagram, and particularly Instagram stories, knitters and sewists connected via blogs and local sewing classes. Now, that community is both global and immediate. It was only a matter of time until broader debates around racial and body inclusivity, which have been happening at the edges of that community for years, wormed their way into the centre.</p> <p>Take size inclusivity. There has been a growing push for ready-to-wear clothing brands to expand their size range to accommodate the average American woman, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/26/average-woman-plus-sized-fashion-doesnt-reflect-that\">according to a 2016 study wears a size 16-18 US</a> (size 20-22 in Australia and the UK). Plus-size women who sew have become used to grading patterns up, cutting multiple muslins, and reworking them to fit.</p> <p>This debate also kicked off in January on the back of <a href=\"https://www.sbccpatterns.com/blogs/news/rtw-explained-why-size-inclusivity-is-not-always-practiced\">a blog listing the technical pattern-drafting reasons why designers may not provide an extended size range</a>. Several large indie pattern companies, the biggest of which was Canadian <a href=\"https://closetcasepatterns.com/\">Closetcase Patterns</a>, responded in furious agreement, saying their decision not to run larger sizes was \u201cabout resources,\u201d not exclusion.</p> <p>\u201cIt hurt a lot of people\u2019s feelings, including mine,\u201d Rockcastle says. \u201cRight now I fit into Closetcase\u2019s sizes but three years ago I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cThe sewing community really works in these trends where a pattern will become trendy and then theres a sew-along and everyone wants to make it and everyone\u2019s sharing their pictures and it\u2019s super fun, so you want to participate and oh \u2014 you don\u2019t fit into that pattern. That\u2019s a bad feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Closetcase currently runs to a size 20, but in January announced plans following criticism from a number of sewing bloggers, including Rockcastle, to expand its size range later in the year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-instagram\"> <blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-permalink=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BtJx-lvBjYY/\" data-instgrm-version=\"12\" style=\" background:#FFF;

The core mission that guides Closet Case Patterns and everything I do behind the scenes, is a deep, abiding belief that sewing is not just a verb, but a life-altering gateway to true self-confidence and body love. The truth is that we are failing that mission if our product does not serve our community to its fullest. While I\u2019ve always had long-term plans to expand our range (it currently spans size 0-20), I did not have clear timelines about when that would happen. I could make excuses about why that is, but the truth is that I did not understand how the failure to prioritize the true needs of our community has been damaging for so many of you. I deeply apologize for not having done this work sooner, and for hurting and disappointing anyone with my ill-considered comments about this issue. We are grateful for the opportunity to change, grow and do better. Behind the scenes, major changes are afoot. I am currently in research mode to design a new and expanded size range going forward. This involves a lot of data crunching and consultation with experts to ensure that our range is as representative as possible. We will be developing and testing new blocks, which will take time. We are not rushing the process, since I am committed to expanding our range with the same thoughtfulness and attention to detail we apply to everything we do. ***Due to character restraints, please read my continued response in the comments below***</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/closetcase.patterns/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Closet Case Patterns</a> (@closetcase.patterns) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-01-27T21:18:52+00:00\">Jan 27, 2019 at 1:18pm PST</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>  <p>Other companies had already begun doing so.

      "bodyText": "Last week, popular fashion patternmaker Papercut Patterns posted a short video on Instagram of one of their patterns being reprinted. The clip was just long enough to see the name of the pattern, the Kochi jacket, passing through the rollers. Three weeks ago, that pattern had a different name. The square-cut short jacket, with optional side ties, was released in June 2017 with the name Kochi Kimono. For 18 months, amateur sewers \u2014 most prefer the term \u201csewist\u201d, for reasons of homonym \u2014 had been making their own versions and sharing the results on Instagram tagged with #Kochikimono. Then, on 13 May, Asian-American woman Helen Kim replied to a new photo of the garment to say that to call it a kimono, without any connection beyond a certain boxiness about the sleeves to the traditional Japanese garment, was cultural appropriation. The post blew up. Those who agreed with Kim were accused of conducting a witch hunt against a female-owned company; those who rejected it were accused of racism. Japanese-American woman Emi Ito, a campaigner against cultural appropriation, was tagged in. She and Kim were suddenly fielding racist commentary on their own accounts. The debate spread rapidly through Instagram stories, an ephemeral medium that allows users to post photos and videos of up to 15-second in length in short, ever-scrolling clips that will disappear after 24-hours. It was waged in long, impossible-to-follow comment threads under Instagram posts until Papercut Patterns deleted the post and closed comments on subsequent posts, sparking another wave of criticism. The same failings that made Instagram a difficult platform for lengthy debate made it the perfect vehicle for outrage. The 16-hour time difference between New Zealand, where the small company is based, and the United States, where most of the angst was coming from, made the company appear slow to respond. \u201cIt was just a shitshow,\u201d says Mary Rockcastle. Rockcastle is a sewing blogger based in New York State, writing at Sablecraft. She watched it unfold from afar. The one-sided nature of Instagram meant that if you were not following bloggers from different social and cultural backgrounds, you were only seeing half the story. \u201cIf you\u2019re only looking at it from one point of view, as a person who is just following Papercut Patterns, you\u2019re like: what could this pattern company possibly be doing, to be fucking up this bad?\u201d Instagram is the network of choice for at-home sewists and knitters who are looking to show off their handiwork and the community is growing rapidly as consumers look for more sustainable and ethical alternatives to fast fashion. A scroll through the most popular accounts shows a familiar Instagram aesthetic: slim, mainly white women in their 20s and 30s, wearing dramatic woollen or linen shapes. It is particularly active during May, where the month-long #MeMadeMay challenge encourages sewists to post daily selfies showing off their self-made outfits. Suddenly, everyone was talking about the Kochi kimono. Ito is a teacher and ethical fashion advocate, on Instagram at @little_kotos_closet. In January she wrote a much-cited article about the cultural appropriation of kimonos, writing about the significance of her family\u2019s kimonos as cultural items and urging designers to consider if another name might work. She was one of a number blocked from the Instagram page, after being tagged by the company in a follow-up post. Kim told the Guardian she did not expect small businesses to be perfect, but did expect they would react to criticism with \u201cempathy and awareness\u201d. \u201cWhen Papercut Patterns deleted my comments and blocked BIPOC [Black, Indigenous, and people of colour] accounts who called for change, they demonstrated what can go wrong when a company fails to demonstrate empathy in rectifying a racially insensitive mistake,\u201d Kim says. \u201cCompanies that label themselves as ethical/inclusive/sustainable have an obligation to take responsibility for the harm they inflict, to mitigate that harm, to address how their mistakes are at odds with their values, and to proactively support inclusivity beyond public relations.\u201d This process, Kim says, is \u201cemotionally and intellectually labour-intensive for the marginalised\u201d who challenge companies on \u201ccultural and racial harm,\u201d but is often \u201ctwisted into a business\u2019s redemption story rather than a visible change in practice and awareness.\u201d It took one day for Papercut Patterns to promise to rename the garment and one week for that video of the newly printed Kochi jacket patterns to appear. Bookending that story, saved to their Instagram page, is a statement from director Katie Romagnoli. \u201cI want to thank everyone who let us know the mistake we made in giving one of our patterns a culturally sensitive name,\u201d she says. \u201cThere has been plenty of important conversation on my last post, and I have truly appreciated the chance to listen and learn \u2026 Thank you everyone. I will be continuing my own education.\u201d The Guardian contacted Papercut Patterns but did not receive a response. It was the second reckoning over racial and cultural insensitivity to rock the craft community this year. The knitters got there first. On 7 January, Karen Templer, a knitwear designer, published a blog about a planned trip to India and likened her excitement and personal anxiety about going, in an offhand line, to visiting Mars. It was widely panned. The post was called othering and imperialistic; her descriptions of India \u201cdeeply racist and reductive\u201d. Templar apologised in a comment on her original post, and in a second post five days later titled \u201cwords matter\u201d . It is easy to dismiss both these debates and the very existence of Instagram-based knitting and sewing communities as trivial. Is this what political correctness has wrought: a culture war in knitting? Until the rise of Instagram, and particularly Instagram stories, knitters and sewists connected via blogs and local sewing classes. Now, that community is both global and immediate. It was only a matter of time until broader debates around racial and body inclusivity, which have been happening at the edges of that community for years, wormed their way into the centre. Take size inclusivity. There has been a growing push for ready-to-wear clothing brands to expand their size range to accommodate the average American woman, who according to a 2016 study wears a size 16-18 US (size 20-22 in Australia and the UK). Plus-size women who sew have become used to grading patterns up, cutting multiple muslins, and reworking them to fit. This debate also kicked off in January on the back of a blog listing the technical pattern-drafting reasons why designers may not provide an extended size range. Several large indie pattern companies, the biggest of which was Canadian Closetcase Patterns, responded in furious agreement, saying their decision not to run larger sizes was \u201cabout resources,\u201d not exclusion. \u201cIt hurt a lot of people\u2019s feelings, including mine,\u201d Rockcastle says. \u201cRight now I fit into Closetcase\u2019s sizes but three years ago I didn\u2019t. \u201cThe sewing community really works in these trends where a pattern will become trendy and then theres a sew-along and everyone wants to make it and everyone\u2019s sharing their pictures and it\u2019s super fun, so you want to participate and oh \u2014 you don\u2019t fit into that pattern. That\u2019s a bad feeling.\u201d Closetcase currently runs to a size 20, but in January announced plans following criticism from a number of sewing bloggers, including Rockcastle, to expand its size range later in the year. Other companies had already begun doing so. Rockcastle names Helen\u2019s Closet as always being slightly ahead of other companies in responding to community feeling: it began re-releasing its existing patterns up to a size 30 in January and changed the name of its Suki kimono to the Suki robe immediately after the Kochi kimono debate started. Carolyn Norman, a plus-sized black woman from the east coast of the United States who blogs at Diary of a Sewing Fanatic, says independent pattern companies were not pushed to be truly inclusive until they faced that widespread consumer criticism earlier this year. She has been sewing for more than 50 years and is frequently discriminated against in sewing shops. \u201cI\u2019ve been followed, questioned about my ability to pay for something and disparaged by the questioner\u2019s unbelief of my answer,\u201d she tells The Guardian. She refuses to shop at companies that don\u2019t stock her size, despite having the skills to adjust the pattern, until they change their ways. \u201cThe world is not one colour or one body shape,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people start to sew to address the inadequacies they face in purchasing ready-to-wear clothing. If the same thing occurs in the sewing world, what recourse does someone have?\u201d Francesca Bleeker is a queer artist and maker from regional New South Wales, Australia.

      "bodyText": "It\u2019s been another tragic day in America, with at least 11 people shot and killed by a gunman in a mass shooting in Virginia Beach. The suspect is also dead, and at least six people are injured. Here\u2019s a roundup of the other major stories of the day: Trump made favorable comments about Boris Johnson, who is in the running to succeed Theresa May as leader of the Conservative Party \u2013 and Prime Minister. Trump became the first Republican president to recognize Pride month. A judge ruled that the last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri may remain open. Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on Mexican goods drew criticism, and the Mexican foreign minister said the two sides would meet for a summit next Wednesday. Attorney General William Barr said he disagreed with much of Robert Mueller\u2019s \u201clegal analysis\u201d in an interview with CBS. Nevada governor Steve Sisolak signed the Trust Nevada Women Act today, making his state an outlier amid the recent wave of state laws restricting abortion rates. The law includes a repeal of the requirement that practitioners tell women seeking abortions about the \u201cphysical and emotional implications\u201d of the medical procedure, according to NPR. \u201cWith our reproductive rights under constant attack across the country, we are proud that Nevada legislators voted to ensure that Nevada women and families are able to make the best decisions for their health and well-being, along with their doctors,\u201d said Caroline Mello Roberson, director of NARAL Pro-Choice Nevada. The governor of Virginia reacts to the mass shooting at a government building. Eleven people have died and six have been taken to the hospital after a gunman opened fired in a municipal building in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The suspect was a current public utilities employee, police chief James Cervera said at a press conference. He was shot and killed by police after he shot a police officer who was saved by a bulletproof vest, Cervera said. We\u2019ll be updating our main story as we get more information here. Will Trump get a primary challenge? Ohio governor John Kasich is playing coy, but it\u2019s unlikely he would have sent this tweet if he didn\u2019t want people to keep talking about the idea. British newspaper The Sun just published an exclusive Oval Office interview with Trump in which the president spoke favorably of Boris Johnson\u2019s bid for the Tory leadership. The Sun described the remarks as a \u201cbombshell intervention\u201d in the leadership contest and \u201cmajor breach of protocol\u201d. Trump\u2019s actual quotes do not approach an actual endorsement, however. After the reporter twice referred to Johnson as \u201cPrime Minster Boris Johnson\u201d, Trump responded with general praise, saying: \u201cI think Boris would do a very good job. I think he would be excellent. I like him. I have always liked him. I don\u2019t know that he is going to be chosen, but I think he is a very good guy, a very talented person. He has been very positive about me and our country.\u201d Later in the interview, Trump also said he likes Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. AOC\u2019s social media mastery continues to amaze. This video of the congresswoman wielding a cocktail shaker has already racked up more than 100,000 views in less than 30 minutes. Hello everyone, this is Julia Carrie Wong in San Francisco taking over the blog for the rest of the afternoon. Donald Trump just became the first Republican president to acknowledge Pride month, which starts tomorrow. The annual celebration of LGBTQ history and identity was first acknowledged with a presidential proclamation by Bill Clinton in 1999, but was ignored by George W Bush, according to BuzzFeed News. Trump\u2019s tweets were met with immediate skepticism and anger by many, however, given his administration\u2019s regressive policies toward LGBTQ rights, including: Banning trangender people from serving in the US military Proposing to remove a rule protecting trans people from discrimination by healthcare providers Opposing passage of the Equality Act, which would extend civil rights protections to LGBTQ people A judge ruled that the last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri may remain open. The Planned Parenthood in St Louis had been threatened with closure by the state at midnight, but the judge ordered the state to let it keep operating until at least Tuesday. Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on Mexican goods drew criticism, and the Mexican foreign minister said the two sides would meet for a summit next Wednesday. Attorney General William Barr brushed off the beating his reputation has taken over the Mueller report by noting: \u201cEveryone dies.\u201d He also said he disagreed with much of Mueller\u2019s \u201clegal analysis.\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while bartending in Queens, is condemning the tipped minimum wage, which allows workers like waiter and bartenders to be paid as little as $2.13 an hour at the federal level. Donald Trump says he\u2019ll be formally announcing his re-election bid on June 18th in Orlando, Florida. US and Mexican officials are due to meet next Wednesday in Washington after Donald Trump announced plans for tariffs on Mexican goods. Mexican foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard rushed to Washington Friday in hopes of heading off the plan, the Washington Post reports. En route to Washington, Ebrard tweeted that he had just spoken by phone to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and presidential adviser Jared Kushner. At a summit Wednesday, Ebrard said that Pompeo will lead the US delegation and he will lead Mexico\u2019s team. \u201cWe will be firm and defend the dignity of Mexico,\u201d he wrote. White House adviser Kellyanne Conway defended Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on all Mexican goods, which have come under criticism from Republicans and business interests. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, she reiterated that the tariffs stemmed from Mexico failing to curb the flow of migrants from Central America to the southern border and also blamed Congress: \u201cWe just don\u2019t think Mexico\u2019s done enough and Congress has done even less than that.\u201d Conway also insisted the tariffs do not jeopardize a proposed trade agreement between the US and Mexico, stating: \u201cWe are fully confident that USMCA could pass the House.\u201d Conway did not directly deny a report that the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer opposes the tariffs. \u201cAmbassador Lighthizer supports the President\u2019s agenda,\u201d she said. The Planned Parenthood clinic in St Louis, Missouri, which was spared today from closure by a judge, is draped in a massive banner reading \u201cStill here.\u201d In a new court filing, the Justice Department provides a transcript of a voicemail left by Donald Trump\u2019s lawyer John Dowd for Michael Flynn\u2019s lawyer. The voicemail, which was excerpted in the Mueller report, came after Flynn dropped out of a joint defense agreement with Trump and began to cooperate with prosecutors. The Illinois state legislature has approved a bill to legalize recreational marijuana in the state, the Chicago Tribune reports. It now goes to governor JB Pirtzker, who is expected to sign it. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been bartending this week - returning to the job she had before running for Congress - to raise support for living wage legislation. NY1 and WNYC have some scenes from today\u2019s venue. The bar where she\u2019s slinging drinks is the same one where Rep. Joe Crowley, the longtime powerbroker she defeated in an upset primary win, had his election night party the night of his loss. There\u2019s a new push from the left to defeat one of the only remaining anti-abortion Democrat in the House, BuzzFeed reports. Progressives are targeting Dan Lipinski, an Illinois congressman. Marie Newman, a Chicago businesswoman, is running against him for the second time. \u201cThis type of legislation is authoritarian and totalitarian. There\u2019s no other way to describe it,\u201d Newman told BuzzFeed of the recent spate of state-level abortion bans. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest about what it is. It\u2019s taking us back 100 years, and that\u2019s not exaggerating.\u201d Bernie Sanders says he will have a \u201clitmus test\u201d and only appoint Supreme Court justices who would uphold Roe v Wade, the LA Times reports. Colorado governor Jay Polis signed legislation banning gay conversion therapy for minors in the state, the Denver Post reports. Polis, the first openly gay man elected governor in the US, also signed a bill to allow transgender Colorado residents to change the gender listed on their birth certificate without having to prove they\u2019ve had surgery. Our Jessica Glenza is at a St. Louis press conference where Planned Parenthood is reacting to a judge\u2019s ruling allowing the state\u2019s sole remaining abortion clinic to remain open at least until Tuesday. Donald Trump, whose administration banned transgender troops from serving in the military, is tweeting in honor of LGBT pride month and urging other countries to decriminalize homosexuality. Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign has brought on a host of new staffers in the last few weeks, Politico reports. They include Hillary for America alum George Hornedo as national delegate director, Ann Mei Chang as a \u201cchief innovation officer,\u201d and Obama White House alum Jillian Maryonovich as creative director. The South Bend, Indiana mayor has also hired a national press secretary, Nina Smith, and two deputy press secretaries, Tess Whittlesey and Marisol Samayoa. Several Republicans in Congress and major business groups are slamming Donald Trump\u2019s plan for tariffs on Mexican goods, NBC News reports. The US Chamber of Commerce said it may file a lawsuit against the White House. \u201cIf the president goes through with this, I\u2019m afraid progress to get this trade agreement across the finish line will be stifled,\u201d Sen. Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, said Friday, according to NBC. \u201cWhile I support the need for comprehensive border security and a permanent fix to illegal immigration, this isn\u2019t the right path forward.\u201d Fellow Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley called it \u201ca misuse of presidential authority.\u201d Dr. Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in response to the ruling allowing Missouri\u2019s only abortion clinic to remain open: \u201cToday is a victory for women across Missouri, but this fight is far from over. We have seen just how vulnerable access to abortion care is here\u2014and in the rest of the country. We are glad that the governor has been prevented from putting women\u2019s health and lives in danger\u2014for now\u2014and call on him to stop this egregious politicalization of public health in an attempt to ban all safe, legal abortion care in the state. \u201cWe want our patients to know that we will never abandon the women of Missouri. We will keep fighting these attempts to end access to health care, to ensure all people can get the care that they need\u2014no matter what.\u201d Dr. Colleen McNichola, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis Region, said: \u201cThis is a huge sigh of relief for the many patients who need access to safe, legal abortion in Missouri. The fight goes on. While temporary, we celebrate today, and tomorrow we go back to work to ensure access to abortion does not go dark at the last health center that provides abortion in Missouri. Planned Parenthood has served Missouri for more than 87 years and we aren\u2019t going anywhere. While Governor Parson abandoned our patients, we will not. Our doors are open today, our doors will be open tomorrow, and we will fight to make sure all patients continue to receive the care they need and deserve.\u201d Our Eric Lutz reports from St. Louis: Planned Parenthood supporters gathered outside the clinic Friday afternoon breathed a sign of relief after a judge ruled that the organization could continue performing abortions past a midnight deadline. \u201cI\u2019m delighted,\u201d said Maude Essen, a St. Louis resident who lives just a few blocks from the Forest Park Avenue facility. \u201cThis gives us a little breathing room.\u201d She and her friend, Mary Kuc, had stood on a corner near the Planned Parenthood, where supporters of the healthcare organization and anti-abortion activists gathered ahead of the ruling. A ruling against Planned Parenthood would have \u201ctaken us back to the 1970s,\u201d Kuc said. Supporters of the organization carried signs, eliciting honks and thumbs-up from passing cars on the busy street. \u201cIt\u2019s fucking ridiculous,\u201d Nella Ballou, a Planned Parenthood supporter, said of the attack on reproductive rights, ahead of the ruling. \u201cIt\u2019s really horrific.\u201d Peg O\u2019Malley stood outside the Planned Parenthood after the ruling on Friday, holding a sign that read: Pro-Choice Catholic. \u201cIt gives me no comfort, she said of the ruling. \u201cThe fight\u2019s not over.\u201d She was antagonizes by a handful of anti-abortion activists, who questioned her Catholic faith. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd,\u201d O\u2019Malley said New York governor Andrew Cuomo said he is \u201cdubious\u201d that the state legislature will legalize marijuana this year, The City reports. A judge has ordered that the last remaining abortion clinic in Missouri can stay open for now. Judge Michael Francis Stelzer granted Planned Parenthood\u2019s request for a restraining order blocking the state\u2019s effort to shut them down. Missouri\u2019s last remaining abortion provider \u2013 a Planned Parenthood in St Louis - was threatened with losing its license after the state charged it did not comply with a health department investigation. It would have been the only state without a single abortion clinic. But the judge ruled that the clinic demonstrated that \u201cimmediate and irreparable injury will result if petitioner\u2019s license is allowed to expire,\u201d so it must be allowed to remain open while the merits of the case are argued. Another hearing was set for Tuesday. Fox News is defending host Laura Ingraham after her comments calling white supremacist Paul Nehlen a \u201cprominent voice\u201d on the right who was \u201ccensored by social media.\u201d \u201cIt is obscene to suggest that Laura Ingraham was defending Paul Nehlen\u2019s despicable actions especially when some of the names on the graphic were pulled from an Associated Press report on best known political extremists banned from Facebook,\u201d the network said in a statement to The Daily Beast. \u201cAnyone who watches Laura\u2019s show knows that she is a fierce protector of freedom of speech and the intent of the segment was to highlight the growing trend of unilateral censorship in America.\u201d California governor Gavin Newsom is encouraging women seeking abortions to come to his state if their own states restrict the procedure. \u201cCalifornia will continue to uphold women\u2019s equality and liberty by protecting their reproductive freedom, educating Californians about their rights to reproductive freedom, welcoming women to California to fully exercise their reproductive rights, and acting as a model for other states that want to ensure full reproductive freedom for women,\u201d Newsom wrote in a proclamation Friday, the Sacramento Bee reports. Newsom and the governors of Oregon and Washington also sent a letter Friday to other governors urging them to pursue laws strengthening abortion rights in their states. Donald Trump\u2019s top trade adviser opposed his push to put tariffs on Mexico, the Wall Street Journal reports. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer argued internally that the tariffs would jeopardize a pending North American trade accord, people familiar with the situation told the paper. \u201cLighthizer is not happy,\u201d one administration official told WSJ. The Pentagon has now gone a full year without a single on-camera press briefing by its top spokesperson, the Hill reports. The briefings used to be routine. Democratic voters are divided on whether to allow felons to vote while in prison, a new poll found \u2013 a question that has also divided the party\u2019s presidential field. In the HuffPost/YouGov survey, 44% of Democrats support allowing those in prison to vote while 41% oppose it. Americans overall oppose it 54% to 31%. An 81% majority of Democrats and a 68% majority of Americans overall support voting rights for felons after they have completed their full sentences. Senator Bernie Sanders has pushed allowing felons to vote from prison. As the last abortion clinic in Missouri is threatened with closure, providers in nearby states are rushing to pick up the slack. Dr Erin King, the executive director of Hope Clinic, the nearest abortion provider across the river in Granite City, Ill., is \u201cscrambling\u201d to prepare for an influx of patients seeking the procedure should St Louis Planned Parenthood\u2019s license be revoked. She says she\u2019s been preparing for a couple years now as the Missouri government ramped up its war on reproductive rights, doubling its number of doctors and increasing its staff. But, she told the Guardian, the immediacy of the Missouri nearing the loss of its last abortion provider is forcing her and her staff to adapt quickly. What\u2019s going on in Missouri is \u201cvery scary,\u201d King said. While she says the crisis won\u2019t impact the level of care at her clinic, located about a 10 minute drive from downtown St Louis, it has put both her staff and her patients on edge. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a significant increase in patient stress in the last two weeks,\u201d she said, referring to the Department of Health and Senior Services challenge to Planned Parenthood and the restrictive abortion bill Republican Governor Mike Parson signed into law this month. On the heels of protests in St Louis, Missouri yesterday, as the state\u2019s last abortion clinic could close, Planned Parenthood\u2019s president Dr Leana Wen told the Guardian women\u2019s healthcare is in a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d in the United States. \u201cThis is a terrifying time,\u201d Wen said. \u201cWe have a situation not unlike a natural disaster, where people\u2019s lives are in danger. Except this is manmade.\u201d Abortion is legal in all 50 US states, but that has not always meant it is accessible. Missouri\u2019s last abortion clinic is in danger of being shutdown because of bureaucratic red tape. Missouri Governor Mike Parson, who signed an eight-week abortion ban into law just last week, has argued the state health department found \u201cdeficient practices\u201d at the health clinic. The health department is demanding interviews with all seven physicians practicing at the clinic, including trainees. Planned Parenthood, which already agreed to perform an addition medically unnecessary pelvic exam on its patients before an abortion (the state now requires two before the procedure) has called the demand \u201charassment\u201d and intimidation of providers. \u201cMissouri\u2019s governor just signed a law that could put doctors in jail for up to 15 years, could allow the state to investigate women for having miscarriages,\u201d said Wen. \u201cSo, there should be no confusion about what the true intention of the Missouri governor really is \u2013 which is to stop all safe legal abortion in Missouri.\u201d Wen also said people should not confuse the wave of new and extreme legislation with a groundswell against abortion rights. \u201cThis is what is happening across the country \u2013 there are extreme politicians who are passing the most egregious law we\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 attacking women\u2019s health,\u201d she said. Two-thirds of Americans support Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 US supreme court decision which legalized abortion, and which continues to make unconstitutional abortion bans, like Missouri\u2019s, unenforceable today. The American people, said Wen, \u201care seeing what we have seen all along \u2013 this threat to Roe v Wade is not hypothetical. It is not a drill. This is really happening,\u201d she said. \u201cThe American people know we need more healthcare, not less, we want our children to grow up in a world with more rights, not less. We will be organizing, educating, mobilizing all across the country.\u201d The Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general found \u201cdangerous overcrowding\u201d and unsanitary conditions at an El Paso, Texas, Border Patrol processing facility, CNN reports. The inspector general did an unannounced inspection of the El Paso Del Norte Processing Center and found 750 and 900 migrants there on two separate days \u2013 far exceeding its capacity of 125. There were \u201cstanding room only conditions,\u201d according to a report obtained by CNN, and Customs and Border Protection \u201cwas struggling to maintain hygienic conditions in the holding cells\u201d with many migrants wearing soiled clothes for days or weeks. There were 76 detainees packed into one cell that\u2019s supposed to hold no more than 12, and 155 in a cell for 35. Donald Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexico will hit particularly hard in some states expected to be key 2020 election battlegrounds, CNBC reports: Several key 2020 electoral states would take a particularly sharp blow from the tariffs. Border state Arizona gets about 40% of its imports from Mexico, the highest share for any state. About 38% of Michigan\u2019s imported products come from Mexico, while about 35% of Texas\u2019 imports are from its southern neighbor. Trump\u2019s surprise tariffs on Mexican goods could raise costs for companies and consumers in those three states, which the president carried in the 2016 election. Michigan is a swing state that had voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. Texas is a reliably red state, but nonetheless has several Republican lawmakers facing tough reelection campaigns next year. Arizona has been trending toward favoring Democrats. Former Ohio governor John Kasich says he\u2019s not planning a 2020 primary challenge to Donald Trump. \u201cThere is no path right now for me, I don\u2019t see a way to get there,\u201d Kasich said Friday on CNN, per the Hill. \u201cNinety percent of the Republican Party supports him,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe somebody wants to run and make a statement and that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019ve never gotten involved in a political race where I didn\u2019t think I could win.\u201d Former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld has launched a long-shot primary campaign against Trump. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the White House is monitoring reports that North Korea executed members of its nuclear negotiating team with the American government, including Pyongyang\u2019s top special envoy to the US. \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on intelligence one way or another,\u201d she said Friday. \u201cI can tell you we\u2019re monitoring the situation and continue to stay focused on our ultimate goal, which is denuclearization.\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders on Friday defended Donald Trump\u2019s plan to impose new tariffs on Mexican imports, telling reporters anyone surprised by the president\u2019s announcement \u201chas been living under a rock\u201d. \u201cWe have been talking to Mexico for months, asking them to step up and do more,\u201d Sanders said, referring to what the Trump administration\u2019s frustration with the flow of Central American migrants through the US-Mexico border. Sanders added that while Trump had not spoken directly with Mexican president Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who threatened retaliatory tariffs against the US, teams for both leaders have been in \u201cregular communication\u201d. \u201cThe president is concerned about national security,\u201d Sanders said. Trump\u2019s move to slap a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports rattled markets and invited criticism from some members of his own party, who accused the president of overstepping his trade authorities. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t blindside his own party,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThis is fully supported by the law.\u201d House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler says he believes Donald Trump\u2019s campaign did collude with Russia, and that Trump would have been indicted if he wasn\u2019t president, Crain\u2019s New York reports. New York City\u2019s police union, a longtime foe of Mayor Bill de Blasio, is warning South Carolina police about de Blasio as he arrives for a campaign stop there. \u201cAs you can see, a President Bill de Blasio would be an unmitigated disaster, not just for union members, but for any American who wants a functioning government,\u201d Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association president Patrick Lynch wrote in a letter to the S.C. Law Enforcement Officers Association, The State reports. The PBA is locked in a contract fight with de Blasio and has protested him as he runs for president. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is not taking a firm position on Donald Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs against Mexico, per the Washington Post. Donald Trump argues that his Mexican tariff plan will cause companies to leave Mexico and return to the US. Mexican President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said Friday that he has sent his foreign secretary to Washington to try to negotiate a solution after Donald Trump announced 5% tariffs on the country\u2019s goods, NPR reports. A federal appeals court has agreed to expedite Donald Trump\u2019s appeal of a ruling allowing a bank to hand over his financial records to the House of Representatives. The second circuit court of appeals on Friday granted the request to fast track the case, the Hill reports. Trump is appealing a ruling by a judge last week who declined to block Deutsche Bank and Capital One from handing over records in response to a subpoena from House Democrats. Only 11 employers were prosecuted for hiring undocumented immigrants in the year that ended in March, the New York Times reports. The data suggests the Trump administration has not made going after employers a priority, even as it pursues hard-line policies on immigration. During the same 12-month period, more than 112,000 individuals were prosecuted for illegal entry or re-entry into the US, according to data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University. \u201cNot only are few employers prosecuted, fewer who are convicted receive sentences that amount to more than token punishment,\u201d TRAC told the Times. Donald Trump\u2019s golf courses have been caught employing unauthorized immigrants, many of whom have since been fired, but never faced any legal consequences. Donald Trump is defending his plan for tariffs on Mexican goods. Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, insisted Friday that the military would remain apolitical, after news emerged that the USS John McCain was hidden from Donald Trump\u2019s sight during a trip to Japan. \u201cOur business is to run military operations and not to become politicized,\u201d Shanahan said in Singapore, CNN reports. \u201cI\u2019ll wait until I get a full explanation of the facts before I pass judgment on the situation, but our job is to run the military.\u201d US stock futures and global stock markets tanked Friday after Donald Trump announced plans for a 5% tariff on Mexican imports. CNN reports on the damage: Japan\u2019s Nikkei (N225) slumped 1.6%, while South Korea\u2019s KOSPI (KOSPI) was mostly flat. Markets in Europe also opened lower. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 index fell 0.8%. Stocks in Germany shed 1.3%, and in Francethey dipped 1%. Stock futures indicated that those losses would extend to the United States. The Dow is poised to fall 230 points, or 0.9%, when markets open. The S&amp;P 500 is tracking similar losses, while the Nasdaq could drop 1.1%. Washington governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee released an immigration plan Friday that calls for a large increase in refugees admitted to the US. Inslee has centered his Democratic primary bid on climate change, and this is his first major police proposal on another issue. CNN reports that it calls for letting at least 110,000 refugees into the country each year. Donald Trump has capped the number at 30,000. He also proposes addressing \u201cclimate migration,\u201d and increasing aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to help those countries tackle the problems, climate-related and otherwise, that have caused a flood of migrants to leave for the US. World leaders will gather in solemn assembly next week above the sandy beaches of Normandy to mark the 75th anniversary of the world-changing D-Day invasion of France. It\u2019s typically a heartfelt tribute to alliance and sacrifice and a unified vow for enduring unity, outweighing any national or political skirmish of the moment - but Donald Trump could change all that, the Associated Press reports: That\u2019s what has some U.S. veterans and others worried about President Donald Trump\u2019s attendance. The president has shown a repeated willingness to inject nationalistic rhetoric and political partisanship into moments once aimed at unity. For Trump, there is no water\u2019s edge for politics, no veneer of nonpartisanship around military or national security matters. The president, who did not serve in the military before becoming commander in chief, has feuded with Gold Star families, blasted political opponents on foreign soil, and mocked Sen. John McCain, a prisoner of war, for being captured by the enemy. Trump\u2019s antipathy for the late senator was so well known that the White House this week requested that the Navy keep the USS McCain out of the president\u2019s line of sight during a recent trip to Japan, so as not to rile the president. It\u2019s a pattern that is set to get more scrutiny in coming days, as Trump heads overseas for the D-Day memorial where he will be joined at the service by, among others, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat whom he has called \u201ccrazy Nancy\u201d and warned not to try to impeach him. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate we have to be even concerned that this historic commemoration will be overly politicized, but this is the command climate he\u2019s created and the reality we have,\u201d said Paul Rieckhoff, founder and former head of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. \u201cWe have to send our president. You go with the president we\u2019ve got, and this is the president we\u2019ve got. So we\u2019re rightfully holding our breath for an event like this.\u201d Senator Elizabeth Warren said Friday that if elected president, she\u2019ll push legislation to reverse the policy that a sitting president may not be charged with a crime. \u201cI\u2019ve got a plan to make sure that no President is above the law,\u201d she wrote in a post on Medium. \u201cCongress should make it clear that presidents can be indicted for criminal activity, including obstruction of justice. And when I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll appoint justice department officials who will reverse flawed policies so no president is shielded from criminal accountability.\u201d The justice department\u2019s longstanding policy says that a sitting president cannot be indicted, though there is no law explicitly prohibiting such criminal charges. Special counsel Robert Mueller has cited the policy as part of his rationale for not concluding whether Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice. \u201cIf Donald Trump were anyone other than the President of the United States right now, he would be in handcuffs and indicted,\u201d Warren wrote. The attorney general William Barr said he disagrees with the \u201clegal analysis\u201d in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report \u2013 and he\u2019s apparently unconcerned about the beating his reputation is taking because he\u2019s got an eye on his own mortality. \u201cWe didn\u2019t agree with the legal analysis, a lot of the legal analysis in the report. It did not reflect the views of the department,\u201d Barr told CBS News in an interview that aired Friday morning. Mueller\u2019s report detailed a number of instances in which Donald Trump may have obstructed justice, but chose not to reach a conclusion about whether or not he was guilty of the crime. He made a point of saying he was not exonerating Trump. \u201cIf we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so,\u201d Mueller said this week. Barr, acting on his own, issued the conclusion that Trump did not commit obstruction of justice. \u201cWe applied what we thought was the right law,\u201d Barr said in the CBS interview. \u201cI was trying to state the bottom line.\u201d The AG also said he was unfazed by attacks on his handling of the report, by critics who say he has misled the public and prioritized protecting Trump over the integrity of the investigation. \u201cI am at the end of my career,\u201d Barr told CBS. \u201cEveryone dies and I am not, you know, I don\u2019t believe in the Homeric idea that you know, immortality comes by, you know, having odes sung about you over the centuries, you know?\u201d You can read the full interview transcript here.",
