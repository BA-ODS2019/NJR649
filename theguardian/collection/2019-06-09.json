      "bodyText": "A Tokyo bank once opened an account in the name of a man who had been dead for 1,000 years. The bank was a branch of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ (now part of MUFG, the largest bank in Japan), which looked out over a neighbouring lot that contained the grave where the man was buried. The bank employees were reportedly instructed not to open any windows to the man\u2019s grave, nor to turn their backs on it, even when at their desks; the account was set up to placate him. The figure? Taira no Masakado, a rebellious warrior who was killed in 940AD but whose spirit has terrorised the region ever since. How Masakado became such a malevolent symbol to ordinary Tokyoites is the story of the city itself, and its centuries of violence, superstition and coincidence. At the time of Masakado\u2019s death, the region now known as Tokyo was little more than mudflats and plains of high reeds. Japan was ruled from far-away Kyoto \u2013 literally \u201cthe Capital\u201d \u2013 while the Tokyo area was the lawless north, the destination for younger sons, bastards and outcasts who were packed off to the frontier.

What is left of the crater is submerged in 200-metre-deep water and covered in sediment.</p> <p>The first hints of the impact came more than a decade ago when Amor was helping undergraduates on a geology field trip in the Scottish Highlands. On the last day, the scientists stopped in Stoer, a small village, to inspect an unusual rock formation known as the Stac Fada member (SFM).</p> <p>Previous researchers speculated that the distinctive red sandstone had come from a volcano, but Amor realised that \u201cstrange green blobs\u201d in the rock resembled features of an impact crater that underlies the town of N\u00f6rdlingen near the Danube in western Bavaria. Amor took samples of the SFM back to Oxford and found strong evidence of an asteroid strike: quartz crystals that had been deformed by the shock of an impact.</p> <p>He also found high levels of platinum and palladium, metals that are enriched in meteorites, the name given to space rocks that survive their fiery passage through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface.</p> <p>Having confirmed that an asteroid had come down near Stoer, Amor and colleagues at Exeter University set about finding the impact crater. Using three independent techniques that drew on the scatter of dust and rocks thrown up by the impact, and the orientation of tiny magnetic grains blasted into the sky, the researchers traced backwards to the point of impact. Details of the work appear in the <a href=\"http://mr.crossref.org/iPage?doi=10.1144%2Fjgs2018-093\">Journal of the Geological Society</a>.</p> <p>Assuming the crater has not been eroded away, it should be possible to detect with a seismic reflection survey of the kind used by prospecting oil companies, Amor said. Further studies of the rock might enable scientists to trace the meteorite back to a family of asteroids still orbiting the sun.</p> <p>It is unclear how common such impacts are because craters are wiped from Earth\u2019s surface by erosion, burial and plate tectonics. However, asteroids of the size of the one that hit the Minch are thought to strike between once every 100,000 years and once every 1m years. While the impact would have been dramatic, sending a mushroom cloud and fireball high into the sky, it was minor compared with the spectacular strike in Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula 66m years ago, when a space rock estimated at six to 50 miles wide put an end to the reign of the dinosaurs.</p>",

The 38,000 mph collision, which thumped a 12-mile-wide crater into the ground, happened 1.2bn years ago, when most life on Earth was still in the oceans and plants had yet to take root on land. At the time, what is now Scotland was a semi-arid land that lay close to the equator. \u201cThe impact would have sent huge roiling clouds of dust and gas at several hundred degrees in all directions from the impact site,\u201d said Ken Amor, an Oxford researcher who led the latest study. What is left of the crater is submerged in 200-metre-deep water and covered in sediment. The first hints of the impact came more than a decade ago when Amor was helping undergraduates on a geology field trip in the Scottish Highlands. On the last day, the scientists stopped in Stoer, a small village, to inspect an unusual rock formation known as the Stac Fada member (SFM). Previous researchers speculated that the distinctive red sandstone had come from a volcano, but Amor realised that \u201cstrange green blobs\u201d in the rock resembled features of an impact crater that underlies the town of N\u00f6rdlingen near the Danube in western Bavaria. Amor took samples of the SFM back to Oxford and found strong evidence of an asteroid strike: quartz crystals that had been deformed by the shock of an impact. He also found high levels of platinum and palladium, metals that are enriched in meteorites, the name given to space rocks that survive their fiery passage through the atmosphere to reach Earth\u2019s surface. Having confirmed that an asteroid had come down near Stoer, Amor and colleagues at Exeter University set about finding the impact crater. Using three independent techniques that drew on the scatter of dust and rocks thrown up by the impact, and the orientation of tiny magnetic grains blasted into the sky, the researchers traced backwards to the point of impact. Details of the work appear in the Journal of the Geological Society. Assuming the crater has not been eroded away, it should be possible to detect with a seismic reflection survey of the kind used by prospecting oil companies, Amor said. Further studies of the rock might enable scientists to trace the meteorite back to a family of asteroids still orbiting the sun. It is unclear how common such impacts are because craters are wiped from Earth\u2019s surface by erosion, burial and plate tectonics. However, asteroids of the size of the one that hit the Minch are thought to strike between once every 100,000 years and once every 1m years. While the impact would have been dramatic, sending a mushroom cloud and fireball high into the sky, it was minor compared with the spectacular strike in Mexico\u2019s Yucat\u00e1n peninsula 66m years ago, when a space rock estimated at six to 50 miles wide put an end to the reign of the dinosaurs.",

Yuriko Koike, the governor of Tokyo, said she is determined that more be done to change attitudes and accessibility. \u201cThe Olympics can only be successful if the Paralympics are also a success,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd part of the ultimate success of the 2020 Games must be creating a more barrier-free society in Tokyo \u2013 including widening hotel rooms and entrances for disabled people and making toiletsand baths more accessible. \u201cIn order to do that I am working with the hotel and tourism industry and on subsidies to make that happen for Tokyo,\u201d she added. \u201cOne of the legacies that I am aiming at is that anyone can easily and comfortably visit the city.\u201d Koike said organisers had also created a \u201cParalympic Passport\u201d to encourage local people to watch and try the events. \u201cThere are 22 different sports that take place in the Paralympics and this passport can be used so that you can get a stamp each time you see, play, or cheer for any games in the Paralympics,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd just last week I achieved all 22. I have seen, participated in, or cheered for all 22.\u201d Koike is particularly found of boccia, a sport she started playing after seeing it at the Rio Paralympics. \u201cAs soon I got back to Tokyo I established a team, and when the former head of the IPC [Sir Philip] Craven came to Japan we had a showdown,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cI was merciless. I took him down!\u201d Guardian Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

The environmental audit committee said the UK is sabotaging its climate credentials by paying out \u201cunacceptably high\u201d fossil fuel subsidies to developing nations, while claiming to lead world in tackling the climate crisis. It called on ministers to stop by 2021 using taxpayer funds to lock poorer nations into a fossil fuel future. The rebuke is the clearest cross-party criticism of the UK\u2019s fossil fuel subsidies and comes after mounting international criticism in recent months. Environmental activist Greta Thunberg said in April the UK\u2019s \u201cactive, current support of new exploitation of fossil fuels\u201d was \u201cabsurd\u201d. The audit committee report found that UK Export Finance (UKEF), which provides lines of credit and insurance to help companies win business overseas, spent \u00a32.6bn in recent years to support the UK\u2019s global energy exports, of which \u00a32.5bn was handed to fossil fuel projects. Only 4% of its funding, or \u00a3104m, was used to support renewable energy projects. Earlier this year, former UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on the UK to stop funding fossil fuel projects in the developing world. He told the committee that UKEF needs \u201crecalibration\u201d to meet international climate trends and obligations. Mary Creagh, the committee\u2019s chair, described the UK\u2019s record as \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \u201cThe government claims that the UK is a world leader on tackling climate change, but behind the scenes the UK\u2019s export finance schemes are handing out billions of pounds of taxpayers money to develop fossil fuel projects in poorer countries,\u201d she said. One of the largest projects included a deal to pay half a billion pounds to the UK subsidiary of a Turkish construction company to build two \u201ccritical\u201d gas-fired power plants in Iraq. The report said Enka UK registered as a UK company a year before its funding deal but does not have an office, staff or operations in the UK. It told the committee it plans to open an office in Birmingham for a staff of 12. A spokesman for UKEF said the government \u201cfully recognises the importance of tackling climate change\u201d and the need \u201cfor a mix of energy sources and technologies as the world transitions to a low-carbon economy\u201d. In the committee\u2019s report Louis Taylor, the chief executive of UKEF, defended the agency\u2019s support for gas-fired power plants as part of a climate \u201ctransition\u201d because it has half the carbon footprint of coal. The report emerged days before the government is expected to legislate an ambitious target to reduce the UK\u2019s net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. The government\u2019s official climate adviser, the committee on climate change, warned last month that \u201cexport finance is not aligned with climate goals, and often supports high-carbon investments\u201d. The UK is also vying to host the UN\u2019s most important climate talks since the Paris agreement next year to draw attention to its climate ambitions. Mike Childs of Friends of the Earth said it crucial that the UK\u2019s finance agency \u201cis divested completely from planet-wrecking fossil fuels\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard our government\u2019s shouting from the rooftops around ambition on emissions reduction in the UK, but for too long this has simply meant outsourcing a lot of high carbon projects overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t solve a crisis by simply moving it somewhere else to make your own numbers look good.\u201d",

The full extent of police use of the \u201creleased under investigation\u201d (RUI) tactic is revealed in a study that shows more than half of firms who responded represent clients who have been waiting for between 18 months and two years. The study by the London Criminal Courts Solicitors\u2019 Association (LCCSA) was conducted in the capital, the south-east and north-west of England. In one case a suspect was found to have been waiting four years for his case to be resolved. A total of 6,519 cases designated RUI were reported in the past three months by the 109 criminal lawyers who responded to the survey.

Most of these services were already in place even before Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games.

      "bodyText": "On a warm May evening in the narrow alleys of Omoide Yokocho (Memory Lane) next to the Kabukicho district of Tokyo, tourists perched on stools study English-language menus offering skewers of grilled meat and vegetables. Others crowd into the garish, glowing Robot Restaurant, a cavernous hall of flashing neon and dancing animatronic figures, or snap selfies in front of the giant replica head of the city\u2019s sci-fi nemesis, Godzilla. In neighbouring Shibuya they drive convoys of go-karts through the streets wearing costumes bearing a suspicious resemblance to Mario, Luigi and the other Mario Kart characters. (Last week Nintendo successfully sued the \u201cMariCar\u201d company for copyright infringement for the second time.) After many decades as a famously impenetrable city to visitors, Japan\u2019s capital is finally beginning to face outward. Tourism, particularly from China but also western countries, rose to record levels last year, and next summer the city will slide open its doors for the Olympics and Paralympics. The country has relaxed its restrictive immigration rules, a move that promises to transform Tokyo. The capital is already dotted with co-working spaces, artisanal coffee shops, international brand boutiques and the other accoutrements of a \u201cglobal\u201d city. By many sensible measures, it met that criteria long ago. It is the world\u2019s largest megalopolis, by far, with 13 million people in the central wards and a greater metropolitan area home to 37 million (Delhi is second with 27 million). It boasts the world\u2019s largest metro economy, with a GDP bigger than that of New York and London, and is home to more global company HQs than any other city. Its public transport network, cleanliness, low crime rate and cuisine are unrivalled. By other reckonings, however, Tokyo remains slightly out of step with its global cousins. Women remain rare in senior business and government positions, restaurants still fill with carcinogenic cigarette smoke and an alarming number of Tokyo citizens die from overwork. The city has embraced international consumer culture, \u201cbut Tokyo isn\u2019t diverse, at least not in the way London or New York are,\u201d says Christopher Harding, senior lecturer in Asian history at Edinburgh University and author of Japan Story: In Search of a Nation. \u201cAll over Tokyo you have film, TV, music, shopping, gaming and so on that feels \u2018opened up\u2019 and cosmopolitan, while underneath, attempts to open up in terms of diversifying the population and shifting the attitudes of local Japanese \u2013 about who belongs and who doesn\u2019t \u2013 haven\u2019t really got anywhere.\u201d This year, however, may be Tokyo\u2019s great tipping point, with genuine transformation into a more open city taking on an air of inevitability, both for demographic and business reasons. In Shinjuku, the Tokyo ward where Kabukicho is located, you could see this wave of change first-hand in January on Coming-of-Age Day, when people who turned 20 in the previous 12 months celebrate reaching adulthood. Around 45% of new adults were of foreign origin, and non-Japanese now make up just over 10% of the ward\u2019s total population, according to the ward office. By contrast, foreign nationals make up just under 2% of Japan\u2019s total population, according to a 2018 survey by the internal affairs and communications ministry. The changing face of the \u201ctypical\u201d Tokyoite will continue. Last year, Shinzo Abe\u2019s conservative government relaxed immigration laws to open the country\u2019s doors to up to 345,000 workers over the next five years. The decision was less a sea change in traditional resistance to immigration and more of an ad hoc response to the tightest labour shortage in decades, as the number of Japanese people of working age continues to shrink. While immigrant workers are being dispatched to the regions to work in creaking industries such as agriculture and fisheries, Tokyo\u2019s service sector is also snapping them up. The city now has 551,683 foreign residents, or 3.98% of the population, compared with 2.44% in 2000. It has also taken the lead in promoting diversity. In 2015, Shibuya ward became the first place in Japan to issue certificates recognising same-sex partnerships as \u201cequivalent to marriage\u201d, allowing same-sex couples to rent apartments together and granting them hospital visitation rights. Even as the national government remains resistant to legalising same-sex marriages, 20 municipalities in Japan have followed Tokyo\u2019s lead with partnership systems. The Olympics, too, may have a profound effect, if the first time the city hosted the event is any indication. In what has been described as the greatest urban transformation in history, the 1964 Games saw a period of mass investment in infrastructure, water and sewage systems. In the five years leading up to the torch relay, 10,000 new buildings appeared in the capital, as well as five 5-star hotels, two new subway lines and a monorail from Haneda airport to the city centre. The Olympics also marked the debut of Japan\u2019s greatest contribution to high-speed travel: the Shinkansen bullet train. \u201cThis helped transform Tokyo from a diseased backwater where only 25% of houses had flush toilets \u2026 into a global megalopolis,\u201d says Robert Whiting, author of Tokyo Underworld. Next year\u2019s Games, he says, \u201cwill help the world see what a global city Tokyo has become\u201d. Peter Matanle, a senior lecturer at the School of East Asian Studies, Sheffield University, says: \u201cThe 1964 Olympics was a huge boost in terms of opening up Tokyo to foreign visitors. One thing that it did was also to make Japan and Tokyo more accessible for other Asians in particular, as many had bad feelings towards Japan.

They were politely asked to leave. Bafflingly, Tokyo has failed to keep up with advances in urban cycling made by other cities around the world, despite the huge number of residents who ride bikes on pavements for short trips. Blue arrows to guide cyclists along Tokyo\u2019s streets can\u2019t conceal faults in the city\u2019s cycling infrastructure, says Byron Kidd, who runs the Tokyo By Bike blog. \u201cI had assumed,\u201d he says, \u201cafter the uptick in cycling and awareness of cycling infrastructure generated by the London 2012 Olympics, that Tokyo would follow suit and develop a world-class cycling infrastructure, the supposed goal of all Olympic host cities. But cyclists are still viewed as an annoyance, as getting in the way of other road users.\u201d By contrast, in a country where disability activism is in its infancy, wheelchair access is an achievement in which the local authorities can take some pride. \u201cJapan has this image of being inaccessible, but in fact Tokyo is much better on access than a lot of people give it credit for \u2013 it\u2019s certainly at the better end of cities in Asia and North America,\u201d says Josh Grisdale, who runs the Accessible Japan website. \u201cPeople from Europe come here and say it\u2019s much easier to get around than back home.\u201d Grisdale, a web designer who has lived in Tokyo for more than a decade, says public transport compares favourably with his home city of Toronto. Station staff are ready with ramps to help wheelchair users on and off trains, and more than 95% of stations now comply with a law requiring them to have lifts from the street directly to the platform. Tokyo\u2019s hotels and restaurants have work to do, though. Only 0.4% of hotel rooms are wheelchair-accessible. Grisdale, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, describes as \u201cinadequate\u201d a new requirement for new hotels with more than 50 rooms to make at least one of them barrier-free. \u201cEating out is a huge issue because laws on accessibility don\u2019t apply to smaller restaurants \u2013 and there are lots of those in Tokyo,\u201d he adds. \u201cI\u2019ve been turned away numerous times, then spent ages looking for somewhere else. They could have portable ramps that could be opened up without too much inconvenience.\u201d Many of the challenges facing Japan are not confined to the capital: the lack of women in senior positions in the public and private sector, the relatively new phenomenon of child poverty, the scourge of karoshi \u2013 death through overwork \u2013 and the threat posed by natural disasters. As it prepares for the coming spotlight as a venue for the Rugby World Cup this autumn and as Olympic host next year, some of the more manageable anomalies are likely to be eradicated, with wider free wifi coverage, more international cashpoints and a concerted attempt to make a dent in the frustratingly resilient language barrier. There is also a growing desire for more green spaces, and for smoke-free restaurants \u2013 a demand the government has gone some way to addressing, although the measures have not received universal support. These embellishments will only add to Tokyo\u2019s status as a global city, according to Mark Schreiber, an American writer who has lived here since 1966. \u201cTokyo is a lot more international than Seoul and Beijing,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at the multilingual signs and announcements at rail stations and aboard trains. Most of these services were already in place even before Tokyo was awarded the 2020 Games. You have to remember that from the Middle Ages, Tokyo was a place that absorbed outsiders, and most Tokyoites come from somewhere else. It\u2019s fairly inclusive as far as Asian cities go.\u201d Harding says: \u201cI can imagine Tokyo becoming quite a bit more diverse in the next few decades. Japan\u2019s bureaucracy is backing it, and the story of Japan\u2019s past 150 years is that its bureaucrats almost always get what they want in the end. I could see quality of life improving too. The result would be more like London than New York \u2013 the latter was built on immigration from the beginning, whereas London wasn\u2019t, and Tokyo won\u2019t be. I could imagine Tokyo becoming a bilingual city, even.\u201d Ultimately, as Japan grapples with a looming demographic crisis, the opening up of Tokyo may become inevitable as a matter of survival. \u201cThere\u2019s a belief here that businesses will go under unless they attract foreign tourists,\u201d says Kei Ono, chief manager in the business planning section at Kabukicho\u2019s Shinjuku Prince hotel, where as many as 40% of guests are from overseas. Nearby, inside a basement bar through a door with a sign imploring English speakers to \u201cDon\u2019t warry, be happy!\u201d Shingo Shibamoto, a member of a Kabukicho business association and owner of an okonomiyaki restaurant, says outward-facing neighbourhoods such as Kabukicho \u2013 which, though home to the city\u2019s red-light district, also attracts as many as a quarter of a million people every day to around 4,000 bars, restaurants, cafes, pachinko parlours and video arcades \u2013 are the future of an \u201copen Tokyo\u201d. \u201cThis has always been a place for outsiders to come and live and work,\u201d he says. \u201cTraditionally it attracted Chinese and Korean people, but now they\u2019ve been joined by people from south-east Asia. I think our neighbourhood has a genuinely global appeal. And as older people who have been here for decades hand their businesses over to younger generations, the pace of change will only increase.\u201d Guardian Cities is live in Tokyo for a special week of in-depth reporting.

      "bodyText": "Michael Gove\u2019s campaign to be Conservative leader is hanging in the balance with calls for him to quit the race, as he was forced to insist that he never misled officials about his use of class A drugs. The environment secretary gave an interview admitting he was \u201cfortunate\u201d to have avoided jail for possession of cocaine, after a new book revealed he had taken the drug on several occasions while a journalist around 20 years ago. He said he had never misled UK government officials or US border authorities by failing to declare he had used drugs in the past and dismissed the idea that he could be subject to a ban on travelling to the US in future as \u201cfoolish\u201d. However, rival teams said momentum was quickly moving away from Gove and towards other candidates who have a similar stance on Brexit \u2013 Sajid Javid, Jeremy Hunt and Matt Hancock \u2013 amid multiple accusations of hypocrisy. His campaign was dealt a further blow as Amber Rudd, the work and pension system secretary, said she was endorsing Hunt, saying he was a serious candidate for serious times. Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians criticised Gove for double standards, while Sayeeda Warsi, the former Tory co-chairman, said he should \u201cstep away from the leadership race\u201d after showing \u201chypocrisy of the highest order\u201d. Javid, the home secretary and one of his fellow leadership contenders, also hit out at middle-class users of class A drugs who failed to think of the \u201ccountless lives destroyed\u201d by the trade. As Gove\u2019s campaign scrambled to respond, the cabinet minister confronted the allegations directly in an appearance on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show, where he said he profoundly regretted taking cocaine. He had already made a confession to the Daily Mail, after it presented him with the allegations in a soon-to-be published biography by the journalist Owen Bennett. However, he looked rattled as he was challenged over whether it was right for him to have overseen a policy of teachers getting kicked out of their profession for taking class A drugs while he was education secretary and to have presided over a prison system as justice secretary in which people could be sentenced to up to seven years for the crime of possession. Gove said he had shown a \u201cdetermination to help people whatever their background, including at education and justice\u201d and that he believed that \u201cwhatever people have done in the past we should look for the treasure in the heart of every man\u201d. A spokesman later said that he had not personally brought in the policy that teachers should be banned for drug use. The cabinet minister also said no one had ever asked him about drug use when he took office. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I\u2019ve ever on any occasion failed to tell the truth about this when asked directly,\u201d he said, when asked if he declared his past drug use to US authorities. The Electronic System for Travel Authorisation visa waiver form for entry into the US asks: \u201cHave you ever violated any law related to possessing, using or distributing illegal drugs?\u201d A spokesman later said Gove had taken legal advice from a QC who is \u201csatisfied that Michael completed his forms correctly\u201d. Gove will attempt to reinvigorate his faltering leadership bid on Monday at a formal campaign event in London, warning that the \u201chere right now is a serious time in the life of our nation and it requires a serious leader\u201d \u2013 in an apparent jibe at the favourite, Boris Johnson. Three other rival candidates \u2013 Hancock, Hunt and Dominic Raab \u2013 were also preparing to launch their campaigns, as Johnson consolidated his position as the frontrunner. Those working for some of the campaigns said they considered it was \u201cgame on\u201d for the second place candidate likely to go into a runoff with Johnson, following the derailment of Gove\u2019s campaign. As Gove scrambled to get back on track on the day at least 11 candidates were expected to submit their formal bids to the Tory party, other developments included: Johnson won the backing of senior Eurosceptics, including Steve Baker and Priti Patel, plus several centrists including Theresa May\u2019s ally James Brokenshire. However, he failed to convince Rudd, who said it was not enough to \u201ccross your fingers, pick up some magic beans and believe in Britain\u201d. A source close to French president Emmanuel Macron also poured scorn on Johnson\u2019s threat to withhold the UK\u2019s \u00a339bn divorce bill, with saying it would be equivalent to sovereign debt default. In a domestic policy offering, Johnson said he would slash income tax for higher earners by raising the 40p threshold from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, claimed Angela Merkel had told him the EU would be willing to renegotiate the UK\u2019s Brexit deal and possibly the Irish border arrangements. He will warn at his leadership event that the UK is facing a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, saying this calls for an experienced leader who knows the \u201cart of tough negotiation, not the art of empty rhetoric\u201d \u2013 in an apparent jibe at Johnson. Javid said he would slow the rate of debt reduction to spend billions of pounds on schools and promised to freeze fuel duty. He also gained the endorsement of two Home Office ministers, Victoria Atkins and Caroline Nokes, as well as Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson. Hancock, the health secretary, was set to formally start his leadership campaign by saying that \u201cif you look inside the heart of every person there is something of value\u201d and a promise to win the case for capitalism at the core of the next general election campaign. Brexit hardliner Dominic Raab was preparing to launch his leadership bid with a focus on cleaner energy and a new wildlife fund. Esther McVey, another leadership hopeful, joined him in saying she could suspend parliament to force through a no deal Brexit if necessary, and promised to use some of the \u00a339bn due to the EU to fund a public sector pay increase. Candidates are likely to be pressed further about their history with drugs at their launch events this week, including Johnson, who has suggested he tried cocaine once but only because he sneezed and it may have been icing sugar. On another occasion, he gave a different story that trying cocaine and cannabis at university \u201cachieved no pharmacological, psychotropic or any other effect on me whatsoever\u201d. Gove\u2019s drug confession appears to have been particularly damaging because of the accusation of hypocrisy, with the Observer reporting that in 1999 Gove wrote an article in the Times setting out why he opposed what he called \u201cLondon\u2019s liberal consensus\u201d on loosening rules on the use of cocaine and other drugs. In the piece, headlined \u201cWhen it\u2019s right to be a hypocrite\u201d, he set out why he believed drug laws should not be repealed. Warsi launched the most blistering critique of his conduct on Sunday, telling Channel 4 News: \u201cIt cannot be that those that govern us are subject to a lower standard of criminality than those who are being governed. Michael Gove needs to step away from the leadership race.

EA is holding its own separate event in LA, EA Play, as it has done for the past couple of years. The games shown were all known quantities - Battlefield 5, The Sims, Apex Legends, FIFA - but we did get a look at 15 minutes of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.

      "bodyText": "Alright, that\u2019s me signing off for now. Here\u2019s a quick schedule for the rest of the E3 press conferences and what to expect from them: Bethesda - tonight at 5:30 PM PT/ 1:30 AM BST: more on Doom Eternal and Wolfenstein Youngblood, probably nothing more on the next Elder Scrolls or Starfield Ubisoft - tomorrow at 1:00 PM PT/ 9:00 PM BST: at least two interesting new games, both of which have sadly already leaked and one of which might be of particular interest to those of us envisioning a grim post-Brexit future Square-Enix - tomorrow at 6:00 PM PT / 2:00 AM BST: the premiere of a new Avengers game will be the star here Nintendo - Tuesday at 9:00 AM PT / 5:00 PM BST: the scoop on a bunch of upcoming Switch games, from Pok\u00e9mon to the Legend of Zelda: Link\u2019s Awakening remake to (I hope) Animal Crossing. Keep an eye on the Guardian Games channel for all the rest of the news from the show. Now that it\u2019s over, here\u2019s the most important news from the night: Project Scarlett, the next-generation Xbox, will launch in \u201cHoliday 2020\u201d (in time for Christmas). Greater processing power and a high-performance SSD will give it the ability to both stream games seamlessly, and potentially eliminate load times. Microsoft\u2019s Project xCloud service will also allow subscribers to play Xbox games anywhere, on any screen, streamed from the cloud - from this October. Halo Infinite will be a Project Scarlett launch game. Bleeding Edge, a new 4-versus-4 multiplayer brawler, is coming from Ninja Theory this year. Cyberpunk 2077 stars Keanu Reeves. Keanu Reeves! Xbox Game Pass Ultimate combines several Xbox and PC games services for $14.99 a month: Game Pass, which gives you access to a library of 100+ games, and Xbox Live Gold, which lets you play and talk online Microsoft has added to its video game development empire with the acquisition of Tim Schafer\u2019s studio, Double Fine Gears of War 5 is out on September 10th on Xbox One This post was amended on 11 June 2019 to correct the release date of the next-generation Xbox. Here\u2019s Halo Infinite in all its glory: That\u2019s a wrap for Microsoft\u2019s E3 conference. I was expecting more on Project Scarlett to be honest, including a non-codeword name, but with so many games to digest in the meantime I can happily wait a while. Will have that full Halo Infinite trailer for you shortly. Halo returns in autumn next year to launch a new generation of Xbox consoles. The trailer shows a marooned space soldier forlornly watching old messages from his family, when Master Chief shows up outside his craft, suspended in the void of space. He\u2019s fixed up and brought back to life, and the iconic shield bar appears at the top of the screen... Project Scarlett is about power and performance, says Phil, where current consoles were about power. Scarlett is all about the ability to stream games as well as play them on-disc or from a download. A new Xbox console, Project Scarlett, will be out in 2020. From a processing perspective it is 4x as powerful as the Xbox One X, promising \u201cresolution and framerates that we\u2019ve never seen before\u201d - 8k capability and 120fps. It\u2019ll have a bespoke solid-state drive that delivers a 40x performance increase. What does this mean for players? No loading times and extremely high-end graphics. The word \u201cseamless\u201d came up about 12 times. For those of us who really care about having a console, though, rather than a cloud service that streams anywhere, Microsoft has developed a cutting-edge new Xbox. Here we go. Okay, here we go: Project xCloud is Microsoft\u2019s cloud-streaming technology, and as of this October you will be able to use it to play your Xbox games anywhere, whether on a console at home or on another screen via streaming. Phil Spencer is back. If we\u2019re going to get a substantial next Xbox announcement, it\u2019s going to be now. Oooohohoho, here\u2019s the new Hidetaka Miyazaki/FromSoftware game they\u2019ve been working on with help from George RR Martin! The Elden Ring looks somewhat more colourful than Bloodborne and Dark Souls, a bit more Western-fantasy, and I\u2019m here for it. There are still trademark FromSoft themes of flame and decay at work in this trailer, of course. No release date for that. Another quick few trailers (is anyone else getting trailer fatigue by now?): Tales of Arise is coming to Xbox in 2020, Borderlands 3 is still happening later this year, and Microsoft has partnered with Smilegate to bring China PC hit CrossfireX to the console next year (it\u2019s a first-person shooter, in case that wasn\u2019t clear from all the men with guns in the trailer). Some quick analysis so far: the Xbox One launched at a time when Microsoft\u2019s games division seemed to have no idea what it was doing, and thought it was a great idea to make the Xbox a kind of sports and TV entertainment hub with an always-on camera staring at you all the time. After they got rid of executive Dom Mattrick and replaced him with Phil Spencer, there was a slow turnaround towards the games-focussed approach we\u2019re seeing tonight - but the games industry being what it is, it\u2019s taken several years for the fruits of that change in strategy to appear. Here\u2019s that distressing Gears of War 5 trailer from earlier: Sega has something to show: it\u2019s Phantasy Star Online! I haven\u2019t thought about that series in about 6 years. The free-to-play Phantasy Star Online 2 - which has been out on other platforms and in Japan for a long time - will be coming to the West via Xbox next year. For some reason, my favourite driving game ever is getting an expansion that turns the whole thing into Lego. Forza Horizon 4\u2019s Ralph Fulton is now standing next to a Lego sports car to tell us more about the Lego Speed Champions expansion: it\u2019s out this week. Dying Light 2 - a more story-focussed follow-up to developer Techland\u2019s zombie-dismemberment parkour game - is coming Spring 2020. Alright, we can all have a breather now whilst Microsoft shows off a car-advert-esque commercial for its new pro controllers. We\u2019re adding trailers to the liveblog where we can. Why has this E3 conference turned into an episode of Robot Wars? This Gears of War 5 trailer is giving me the absolute heebs. It\u2019ll be out on September 10th - or, annoyingly, 5 days earlier for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. Flames and smoke appear to be engulfing everyone in the theatre for dramatic effect as a camera is lowered beneath the stage to show new footage of the game. These monsters look rather different (and more artificial) than the OG Gears Locust hordes. A new mode, Escape. is an \u201caggressive 3-player co-op experience\u201d. Anthony Tan\u2019s heavily Studio Ghibli-influenced game about magical (?) deer exploring a seemingly post-human world also looks super interesting. This looks interesting: 12 Minutes, an interactive thriller about a man trapped in a time loop. (trailer incoming) A new Dragonball Z action-RPG game is coming next year and I have nothing more to say about it because I barely knew what I was looking at. I\u2019m so sorry, anime fans. TT Games is making a new Lego Star Wars game for next year, spanning ALL NINE films. A new trailer for Psychonauts 2 shows a game exactly as weird and rough-around-the-edges as I was hoping for. If you\u2019ve never played Psychonauts, do yourself a favour and pick it up for about \u00a31, it\u2019s one of the strangest and best platformers I\u2019ve ever played. Wow, what a turnaround for Tim Schafer and his Double Fine studio over the years. From Psychonauts getting dropped and almost cancelled (by Microsoft, I should add) in 2005 to, presumably, an acquisition worth MANY millions. Matt Booty is here to remind us that Microsoft has added 7 new studios to its portfolio in the last year. (We know, Matt, you own all the things.) And now there\u2019s another: Double Fine Productions, a huge acquisition for Microsoft. Another blast from the past now in the form of Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition, now in 4K with remastered audio. I hope they\u2019ve replaced the godawful Scottish accents in the tutorial. There have been some, let\u2019s say, warm responses to Keanu\u2019s appearance at the Xbox E3 event... This is rather unexpected - a new Microsoft Flight Simulator game taking centre stage at an E3 conference. It looks extremely beautiful, to be fair, a world away from the janky version I had in 1999 Now there\u2019s a new confusing but good-value subscription option: Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which comprises Xbox Live Gold (to play online) and Xbox Game Pass (for free games), on both Xbox and PC, for $14.99 Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, Hollow Knight, Metro Exodus and Batman Arkham Knight are all being added to Microsoft\u2019s game subscription service, Xbox Game Pass. As was previously announced, the service is coming to PC (launching today in beta), with a specially selected range of games - including the Master Chief Collection. We\u2019re adding in trailers as we go here - give the page a refresh to see \u2018em. I\u2019m rather liking these indie games - the hand-drawn RPG Time: The Legend of Wright has a distinct Media Molecule feel, and before that we saw a cute-looking adventure game in which you toddle about with a cat. Trailers for those incoming. We\u2019re also seeing the now-customary showreel of indie games, with about three seconds of footage for each. Oh good lord, I keep forgetting that Battletoads was ever a thing (and that it\u2019s coming back), but here we are. It\u2019s 16th April 2020. Can\u2019t wait. Here\u2019s that trailer, featuring KEANUUUUU: Keanu seems charmingly convinced on Cyberpunk 2077 and its branching narratives. \u201cThe game is gonna be breathtaking,\u201d he says. Someone in the crowd shouts back \u201cYou\u2019re breathtaking!\u201d And KEANU REEVES!? That\u2019s a get! Now for an update on possibly the most-anticipated game of this whole show (that we know about): Cyberpunk 2077 from CD Projekt Red. Grimy neon, shady deals, drugs and, of course, extreme violence. Ooh, now for a world premiere: it\u2019s Blair Witch game, set in 1996 and developed by Bloober Team (of Layers of Fear). There\u2019s lots of mist and shaky first-person footage and torchlit terror. No new Xbox platform announcements yet, though - instead here\u2019s more footage of Respawn\u2019s new single-player Star Wars game Jedi: The Fallen Order, which does look bloody excellent. Lightsabers, humour, Titanfall-esque free movement... I\u2019m here for it. And also for the ginger Jedi. That\u2019s out 15 November this year. Phil is talking up his favourite \u201ctwo billion gamers worldwide\u201d statistic, which he likes to bust out at every opportunity. Microsoft\u2019s mission now, he says, is to connect people to games wherever they are, whomever they\u2019re with - a post-platform approach, reading ever so slightly between the lines. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer is here to address the almost uncomfortably adoring crowd (\u201cWE LOVE YOU!!!\u201d screams one particularly enthusiastic fan). Ah yes, Minecraft. (Microsoft owns EVERYTHING.) Minecraft Dungeons is block-building meets Diablo - we\u2019ve seen it before, but it looks cute. It\u2019ll be out Spring next year, with 4-player local and online multiplayer. Ninja Theory (also now a Microsoft studio) is here to show Bleeding Edge, a new multiplayer melee combat game with a distinct DmC vibe: a bright acidic palette, bone-crunching action-violence and an unashamedly eccentric look. Here\u2019s the trailer: The first game shown is a dystopian, colourful science-fiction affair. \u201cThis is Halcyon, the further colony in the galaxy, proudly owned and operated by corporations.\u201d It\u2019s The Outer Worlds, a new role-playing game from Obsidian (a recent Microsoft acquisition). It\u2019ll be on Xbox Game Pass, on PC and Xbox One. A packed theatre in LA cheers as we\u2019re shown a reel of recent Xbox games, from We Happy Few to Forza Horizon, and a glimpse of Master Chief. In the room, a disembodied voice has just announced \u201cThis programme contains titles rated M for Mature\u201d, to a wave of applause and cheering from the crowd, reports Alex. Yay... video games.... Maverick Japanese designer Suda51 is in the house... Just a few minutes to go now. Personally I very much hope we finally see the new Fable game that I\u2019ve heard is in development at Playground. (ALLEGEDLY.) Speaking of cloud-based streaming services: Google decided to spill the details of its own video games subscription service, Stadia, a few days ago. Long story short, you\u2019ll pay \u00a38.99 a month for a small selection of games and a la carte prices for more. Google is currently the main competitor to Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Game Pass service, so it\u2019ll be interesting to see how they compare. Developers are posting from the Xbox venue. Here\u2019s the crew from Rare, so we can expect some kind of Sea of Thieves announcement. We can expect the other big game publishers to show up in style, too - without wanting to upset anyone who considers an E3 leak a spoiler, the broad-stroke details of a big game from Ubisoft have already made it out into the open. Bandai-Namco\u2019s new announcements have also leaked, and are very likely to show up at this conference. Now: let\u2019s talk about what Microsoft has to show. Two things are relatively certain: we\u2019ll learn more about Project Scarlet, the company\u2019s upcoming new Xbox console, and we\u2019ll get a firmer idea of the cloud-based subscription services that Microsoft has been talking up for the past year or so. The house of Xbox has also been on a mad studio-acquisition run for the past couple of years, and we are likely to see what those studios have been up to under their new owners. Head of Xbox Phil Spencer promised 14 new first-party games at this conference, which would be a record. Expect plenty of new games alongside updates on Gears of War 5, Halo Infinite and the other long-standing Xbox franchises. Here\u2019s a photo from our tech editor Alex Hern, who\u2019s in the room early for Microsoft\u2019s press conference. It\u2019s kicking off in 35 short minutes. Some more wee news nuggets from yesterday\u2019s EA show: FIFA 20 will have a street football mode called Volta Football, much to the delight of FIFA Street fans who have been languishing for years The unstoppable Sims 4 is getting a new expansion, Island Living, that brings a tropical setting, water sports and, uh, conservationism to the game, available on 21st June (16th July on consoles). There\u2019s also a Pride pack featuring queer costumery and gender-neutral toilets. Some new EA-published indie titles were announced: Lost in Random, from the developers of Fe; British-made Rustheart; and an as-yet-untitled new game from Hazelight, makers of co-op prison-break game A Way Out Battlefield 5 is very much still a thing, and will be getting a Pacific-themed chapter this autumn Runaway battle royale hit Apex Legends\u2019 second season begins July 2nd, and brings with it a new playable hero: Wattson. Take a look: Before we start speculating about what\u2019s ahead, though, let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s happened in the run-up to E3 2019 so far.

The anthem poses another good question here. To Portugal the glory. But the fortune has been well spread. A total of \u20ac112.875m in prize money has been disbursed widely by Uefa. England have earned close to \u20ac10m from their run, a bonus equal to one quarter of the Scottish FA\u2019s complete annual turnover. And money is, of course, the key to all this. International football has been perilously placed for the last few years. These are interesting times, from the debaucheries of the House of Blatter to the more destiny-fuelled stylings of the age of Infantino, with plans that could even now see the whole supporting infrastructure re-geared around mystery multi-billionaire investors. Which way will football jump? Perhaps this small but successful addition might just act as a bulwark, a stop on one or two of those plans. Maybe the point about the Nations League is that it rules out other things that might bring even more money and greater change, filling the space that could let them happen. A welcome addition on balance but also perhaps a useful one.",

Vettel has bemoaned how F1 drivers \u201csound like lawyers\u201d and says this is a million miles from the sport he fell in love with decades ago. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>You know, I\u2019m a purist, I love going back, looking at the old cars, the old drivers, it is an honour to meet them and talk to them \u2013 they are heroes in a way. I really love that but I just wish I was as good as I am, doing what I do, but being in their time rather than today. It is not just about that decision, it is other decisions as well. The wording, when people come on the radio, we sort of have an official language and I think it is wrong. I think we should be able to say what we think, but we are not. In this regard, I disagree with where the sport is now. You have all this wording, yeah, you gain an advantage, you avoided a collision \u2013 I just think it is wrong. It is not really what we are doing in the car. It is racing, it is common sense and if there is a hazard on the track, it is quite natural to slow down. Lewis [Hamilton] obviously had to react but, for me, that is racing and a lot of the people I mentioned earlier, the old F1 drivers and people on the grandstand would just agree this part of racing. But nowadays it is I don\u2019t like it, we all sound a bit like lawyers, using an official language and it gives no edge to the people, to the sport and, ultimately, it is not the sport I fell in love with. Lewis and myself, we share great respect, because we have achieved so much in the sport. It is just I am not happy about all this complaining that we have seen so many times.</em></p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/09/lewis-hamilton-canadian-grand-prix-vettel-penalty\">Lewis Hamilton handed Canadian Grand Prix win after Vettel\u2019s penalty pain</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T21:03:24.414Z\">at 10.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5cfd717d8f084466bb196be1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T20:58:18.495Z\">9.58pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>And a glance at the top of the driver\u2019s championship:</strong></p> <p>Lewis Hamilton, 162 pts<br>Valtteri Bottas, 133<br>Sebastian Vettel, 100<br>Max Verstappen, 88</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfd711d8f084466bb196bdd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T20:51:45.787Z\">9.51pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Confirmation of the race classification:</strong></p> <p>1 Hamilton<br>2 Vettel<br>3 Leclerc<br>4 Bottas<br>5 Verstappen<br>6 Ricciardo<br>7 Hulkenberg<br>8 Gasly<br>9 Stroll<br>10 Kvyat</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfd70218f0895eae9513866\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T20:48:40.522Z\">9.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>\u201cThe five-second penalty awarded to Vettel is ridiculous,\u201d</strong> emails Graham Morrell. \u201cSafety is a most important factor but the decision ruined the race.

      "bodyText": "Thanks a lot for your company. Bye! Right, the final word goes to a very disheartened Sebastien Vettel, who is not mincing his words after being slapped with a controversial five-second penalty in Montreal. Vettel has bemoaned how F1 drivers \u201csound like lawyers\u201d and says this is a million miles from the sport he fell in love with decades ago. You know, I\u2019m a purist, I love going back, looking at the old cars, the old drivers, it is an honour to meet them and talk to them \u2013 they are heroes in a way. I really love that but I just wish I was as good as I am, doing what I do, but being in their time rather than today. It is not just about that decision, it is other decisions as well. The wording, when people come on the radio, we sort of have an official language and I think it is wrong. I think we should be able to say what we think, but we are not. In this regard, I disagree with where the sport is now. You have all this wording, yeah, you gain an advantage, you avoided a collision \u2013 I just think it is wrong. It is not really what we are doing in the car. It is racing, it is common sense and if there is a hazard on the track, it is quite natural to slow down. Lewis [Hamilton] obviously had to react but, for me, that is racing and a lot of the people I mentioned earlier, the old F1 drivers and people on the grandstand would just agree this part of racing. But nowadays it is I don\u2019t like it, we all sound a bit like lawyers, using an official language and it gives no edge to the people, to the sport and, ultimately, it is not the sport I fell in love with. Lewis and myself, we share great respect, because we have achieved so much in the sport. It is just I am not happy about all this complaining that we have seen so many times. And a glance at the top of the driver\u2019s championship: Lewis Hamilton, 162 pts Valtteri Bottas, 133 Sebastian Vettel, 100 Max Verstappen, 88 Confirmation of the race classification: 1 Hamilton 2 Vettel 3 Leclerc 4 Bottas 5 Verstappen 6 Ricciardo 7 Hulkenberg 8 Gasly 9 Stroll 10 Kvyat \u201cThe five-second penalty awarded to Vettel is ridiculous,\u201d emails Graham Morrell. \u201cSafety is a most important factor but the decision ruined the race. I have been following F1 since the late 70s but it has gone downhill lately, so much so that I will not be following it any longer.\u201d Chris Pollard, also via email, adds: \u201cThe stewards\u2019 decision was absolutely correct, and the chief steward [Emanuele Pirro] was himself a five times Le Mans winner, so no beginner. Sebastian Vettel, whom I admire greatly, has been racing long enough to know that. He should have accepted his punishment gracefully, knowing that what he had done was both wrong and dangerous.\u201d Do keep your emails and tweets coming. Another, slightly tamer, soundbite from the Ferrari camp. Charles Leclerc, who crossed the line third, said he had no idea of the chaos involving his team-mate that unfolded in front of him. \u201cI was not told on the radio that Seb had a five-second penalty,\u201d he says. \u201cI just really wanted to try and push because I could see that I was faster than the guys in front.\u201d The Ferrari team principal, Mattia Binotto, has weighed in with his two-pennies\u2019 worth. \u201cWe will calm down, everyone will calm down in a couple of hours,\u201d he says, with a warming smile. \u201cWe won today. I think honestly we were the fastest on track today and that is important. Everyone I think believes that there was nothing Sebastian could have done. I don\u2019t think he had any bad intentions at all. He stayed ahead the entire race, he went through the chequered flag, for us he is the winner.\u201d And, rather pertinently, he adds: \u201cThe season is not over.\u201d \u201cOne more nail in the coffin of F1,\u201d so-says Retro Duo, via Twitter. A damning statement indeed on the back of that lap 48 drama. Meanwhile, Karl Semkow adds: \u201cIMO, the Formula 1 Stewards make the fairest, most impartial calls of any sports governing body I\u2019ve seen.\u201d A lively finish in Montreal! Let\u2019s hear from Lewis Hamilton, who looks drained, fed up of talking about the whole shabang. \u201cI am a little bit deflated, really,\u201d the Mercedes driver says. \u201cMy team worked so hard to fix the car. Saturday was a really great day, I got out there back on rhythm. Today we had an engine problem, it was like a kick in the nuts but they worked so hard to get the engine back together. Then I had a problem at the start and I wasn\u2019t sure how I would get away. The Ferraris are really quick on the back straight so I knew I had to put him under pressure \u2013 and he made a mistake. Ultimately the rules say that when you go off [the track] you have to come on in a safe manner and I had to back out to avoid a collision, so I guess that is why they made a decision. I\u2019m going to re-watch it but all I can say is that I didn\u2019t do anything today \u2013 I didn\u2019t do anything to deserve booing \u2013 I was just racing my heart out.\u201d What do we make of it all? \u201cA very harsh penalty that looks bad for F1,\u201d emails Keith Lewis. \u201cLooks like a fix. It was a dangerous incident but Vettell had nowhere to go. Hamilton wisely decided to stay out of trouble. This was a racing incident. The race was stolen from Vettell. A bad day for F1.\u201d Kevin Alway, also via email, adds: \u201cBad call officials.\u201d An angered Paul Marin goes one step further: \u201cLewis doesn\u2019t win anything today,\u201d he says. \u201cThe stewards gave him the win, and he should be ashamed to accept the win on that way, because Vettel didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Shame to Formula One staff as well as the Mercedes team.\u201d Sebastian Vettel gives his verdict and, rather damningly, suggests these kind of decisions are hugely damaging to F1. \u201cIt is not making our sport popular, is it?\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want to see us race and that was, I think, racing. I don\u2019t know. I hope the people come back. That is the main thing. They are the reason why we are able to put this show on and build these incredible cars. It is just a shame when we have all these little funny decisions. I think we really deserved to win today, that is our opinion and I think the people\u2019s opinion as well. It is a bit weird now to be honest, I don\u2019t know what else to say.\u201d What a mess, really. Well, then. That rather bizarre win takes Hamilton 29 points clear at the top of the driver\u2019s championship. Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, admits the five-second penalty awarded to Vettel is a \u201ccontroversial decision\u201d. Wolff adds: \u201cFrom a clear regulations point, they have just interpreted what is black and white. If you are a Ferrari fan or someone keen on hard racing, you might want to see more of a bumper-car mentality. The race stewards need to be supported. They have looked at the incident and that needs to be respected. We should not ignite it even more.\u201d A quick word from a thoroughly deflated Vettel. \u201cThe people should not boo Lewis, I don\u2019t think there was any intention of his to be in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he says. \u201cIf anything, they should boo these funny decisions.\u201d A sheepish Hamilton says: \u201cAll I can say is I did not make the decision.\u201d A numb Vettel adds: \u201cI really enjoyed the race, I enjoyed the crowd cheering me on, especially around the hairpin. With the rest, I think I have said enough, you should ask the people what they think.\u201d A smattering of boos as Lewis Hamilton uncomfortably lifts the trophy aloft! Vettel is quietly seething up on the podium. The Ferrari driver feels robbed. None of the drivers are too keen on spraying one another with champagne. What a truly odd finish to this 50th Canadian GP! Vettel finds time to congratulate Leclerc. This is superb stuff, almost slapstick entertainment. Vettel picks up the the No 2 board from where his car should be in parc ferm\u00e9 and puts it in front of Lewis Hamilton\u2019s car, and hoists the No 1 in front of an empty space besides the paddock, where his car should be. The Canadian crowd applaud his humour. They feel aggrieved for their man. At long last, Vettel was persuaded to make his way back towards the podium from the Ferrari compound. The German\u2019s head is bowed, but he is getting a huge ovation from the crowd in Montreal. \u201cWhere was I supposed to go?\u201d Vettel sternly asks Hamilton, as they meet in the podium waiting room. A smarting Hamilton just shrugs his shoulders. Lewis Hamilton is all smiles, despite winning the race in truly bizarre fashion. \u201cThat is absolutely not the way I wanted to win but I forced him into an error,\u201d he says of the incident on the exit of turn four. \u201cWe nearly collided, it was unfortunate \u2013 but that is racing. I took the corner normally but when you come back on the track you are not supposed to go straight back on to the racing line. It was so hot here, the Canadian weather is so hard-core.\u201d Meanwhile, a raging Sebastien Vettel has gone straight into the FIA garage. He is slamming doors, huffing and puffing, and he clearly is desperate to get some answers about what has just happened. But it is Sebastian Vettel that crosses the line and passes the chequered flag first. A bizarre finish, with the Ferrari slapped with a five-second penalty for \u201cforcing another driver off the track\u201d. A cruel twist in the tail for Vettel, who has effectively led from start to finish after blowing Hamilton away in qualifying. Toto Wolff puffs out his cheeks, Hamilton punches the air \u2013 but it is a gutting end for Vettel, who ends up finishing third, behind his Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc. To be clear, Vettel crosses the line first \u2013 but that penalty means Hamilton takes victory ahead of him, with Leclerc jumping from third into second on the podium. \u201cThat is not the way I wanted to win, I wanted to go past him \u2013 but thank you for your confidence,\u201d says Hamilton. As for Vettel, the German, it is fair to say, is fuming. \u201cSeriously, you need to be an absolute blind man to think that you can go from the grass and then control your car \u2013 I was lucky I did not hit the wall. Where the hell am I supposed to go? This is unfair. Great crowd, great race. Grazie.\u201d Lap 69/70: The penultimate lap, then! Lap 68/70: \u201cPush now,\u201d Vettel is told by Ferrari, but the stewards\u2019 decision to hand him a five-second penalty has killed his chances of victory. Vettel is set to finish the race in first place \u2013 but Hamilton will surely take the win. Lap 67/70: A quick glance at things: 1 Vettel 2 Hamilton + 0.8sec 3 Leclerc 4 Bottas 5 Verstappen 6 Ricciardo 7 H\u00fclkenberg Lap 66/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 0.6 sec. Lap 65/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 0.7sec \u2013 but the Ferrari will have to serve a whopping five-second penalty. The Mercedes is in dreamland. Leclerc, on youthful tyres, is 3.4sec behind Hamilton. Lap 64/70: Vettel\u2019s lead has been cut to a slender 0.9sec. That is not going to be anywhere near enough to win. To make matters worse, Leclerc is whizzing round. He has just set a new fastest lap of 1.14. Vettel could finish third at this rate. Lap 62/70: The fight at the front of the grid was brewing beautifully \u2013 but that five-second penalty might deprive us of any late drama. Vettel is struggling to build the kind of lead he needs to. The Ferrari is two seconds in front of Hamilton, 10sec in front of Leclerc. Lap 60/70: \u201cWhere the hell was I supposed to go?\u201d asks Vettel. \u201cThey are stealing the race from us.\u201d The Ferrari driver is absolutely livid. \u201cStay focused, confident,\u201d is the message back at him down the team radio. Ferrari are powerless to even appeal that five-second penalty, which will be added on to Vettel\u2019s time as soon as he passes through the chequered flag. That penalty seems harsh on Vettel \u2013 but Hamilton called for it straightaway. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen, meanwhile, makes a second stop. Lap 59/70: \u201cStay on his gearbox,\u201d is the message from Mercedes to Hamilton. Providing he stays on the tail of Vettel, the Briton has a healthy chance of picking up victory. Hamilton wants more power from his car, but the news that Vettel has been penalised for that collision on lap 48 is the perfect fillip. Lap 58/70: Well, well, well ... Sebastien Vettel has been slapped with a five-second time penalty by the FIA for \u201cunsafe re-entry and forcing another driver off the track\u201d. Hamilton did have to jam his brakes on out of turn four. That is music to the ears of Mercedes, particularly Hamilton. Suddenly Vettel needs to put his foot down and more than triple his lead. \u201cI had nowhere to go, seriously,\u201d Vettel says. The Ferrari is absolutely raging in the cockpit. Lap 57/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 1.7sec. Lap 55/70: Kevin Magnussen, it is fair to say, is moping his way round Montreal. \u201cThis is the worst experience I have ever had, in any race car,\u201d says the Haas driver. \u201cIt is not a nice experience. Enough means enough.\u201d Hardly a glowing endorsement. Magnussen, who crashed in Q2, meaning his car required a total facelift, is way down in 18th. He is having a torrid time. Lap 54/70: Vettel has found an extra big of zip from somewhere, extending his lead over Hamilton to 1.5sec. Meanwhile, Bottas sets a new fastest lap. Lap 53/70: Verstappen is up into fifth, ahead of Ricciardo. Lap 52/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 0.8sec. Lap 51/70: Relentless driving out in front! A tantalising bit of racing between Vettel and Hamilton \u2013 and you sense there is still plenty to come yet. These are the kind of fights Hamilton says he relishes. Lap 49/70: Vettel laps the Toro Rosso of Alex Albon, with Hamilton still in close company. Things are beginning to heat up in Montreal. Lap 48/70: Vettel goes wide \u2013 but the Ferrari gets away with it! A huge error goes unpunished and the German \u2013 just about \u2013 manages to preserve his lead. The rear wheels did not stick and Hamilton thought he could dive in to steal the lead but Vettel held his nerve. Hamilton argues that the manner in which Vettel rejoined the track \u2013 effectively shoving the Mercedes up on the ropes, against the wall at turn four \u2013 was dangerous. The stewards are having a nosy at it. It would seem harsh. Lap 47/70: Stroll comes back out of the pits and stays among the points, ahead of Kvyat to take 10th. Vettel\u2019s lead has been cut to 0.7sec ... Lap 46/70: Hamilton is closing again on Vettel, who has just called in to Ferrari with a moan about something. That is all the initiative Hamilton needs at the moment. The Mercedes is right on the tail of the race leader. Meanwhile Lance Stroll finally pits. On go the medium tyres, having already run the hard tyres. Lap 45/70: Bottas sets a fastest lap of 1.14.933. Lap 43/70: \u201cBrake pedal almost on the floor,\u201d shouts Verstappen down the Red Bull team radio. Unfortunately for him, there is a long, long way to go. Just ask Vettel, who has another 27 laps of slogging it out with Hamilton. A gentle reminder that Verstappen and Lance Stroll are the only two drivers yet to stop. Lap 41/70: That is the second time Hamilton has made a mess of coming out of the hairpin. And Vettel breathes an inaudible sigh of relief. The Ferrari is determined to stretch his legs once more. Lap 40/70: For the first time, Vettel is feeling the heat. But Hamilton goes wide into turn 10. That was clumsy, locking up a little bit. The Mercedes swiftly undoes some of \u2013 but not all of \u2013 that hard work. The gap is simply one second. Lap 39/70: Bottas zooms beyond Ricciardo, and makes the move stick. Bottas is not hanging around. Next up? Closing the gap on Verstappen. Hamilton is really beginning to gain on Vettel, who made a meal of lapping R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen. The Mercedes trails by 0.8sec ... Lap 37/70: Mercedes politely ask Bottas to up the ante. He is closing on the Renault of Ricciardo, too. Vettel is 1.8sec ahead of Hamilton. Lap 36/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 2.5secs, with over half the race gone. Leclerc is third, 1.5sec ahead of Verstappen. All to play for! Lap 34/70: Hamilton sets a lightning fastest lap of 1.15.2. Ricciardo and Bottas, meanwhile, tussle wheel-to-wheel for fifth, but the former clings on to stand his ground. The Mercedes is hungry. Down the grid, Antonio Giovinazzi pits, presumably for a breather as much as anything after a wild couple of laps. Lap 33/70: In comes Charles Leclerc, allowing Sebastien Vettel to re-gain the lead. Hamilton will jump into second. Leclerc is in and out, but arrives back on the track a little out of touch. Leclerc is fourth, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo. Lap 32/70: H\u00fclkenberg remains seventh but continues to have gearbox issues. He jinks off the track before regaining his position. And Grosjean loses out to Sergio P\u00e9rez. Grosjean is not happy about it, asking for race control intervention. Lap 31/70: Bottas is told to box, and he will jet into the pits. \u201cAre we going long, trying to keep this pace?\u201d asks Leclerc down the team radio. Meanwhile the Alfa Romeo Antonio Giovinazzi veers off the track at turn 1, losing ground in 11th. Lap 30/70: Vettel sets a new fastest lap of 1.15.333, as Hamilton races out of the pits just in front of his team-mate Bottas. Leclerc, who is yet to pit, is out in front, around 11sec ahead of Vettel. Things are looking rosy for Ferrari. Lap 29/70: Hamilton fumes down the team radio, slagging off his flailing tyres. He is going to pit .. Lap 28/70: Hammer time for Hamilton, the new race leader. Leclerc is 2.3sec behind the Mercedes, with Vettel slotting into third. \u201cWe are going to extend as much as we can,\u201d Hamilton is told down the team radio. Bottas is fourth. Lap 27/70: Vettel pits! On go the hard tyres. A 2.7sec stop. Lap 26/70: Hamilton sounds breathless down the team radio. It is almost 50C out on the track. Whoever takes victory will have to work for it. Lap 25/70: Who will blink first? Vettel leads Hamilton by 1.6sec. \u201cPush now, push now\u201d Ferrari tell the race leader down the team radio. Lovely stuff. Lap 24/70: Lance Stroll is having a good time. He started in 17th but is up to eighth. Saying that, he is yet to pit. Meanwhile, trouble in paradise for H\u00fclkenberg? He is having a moan down the team radio. It does not sound good. Lap 23/70: Hamilton eats into Vettel\u2019s lead, cutting the gap down to 1.7sec. The front three are all operating at a similar, punchy pace. No let-up yet. Bottas has work to do, 16 seconds behind third-placed Leclerc, who is really beginning to motor. Lap 22/70: A moment ago, the Wall of Champions called Antonio Giovinazzi\u2019s name \u2013 but he just got away with shaving his way down a nugget of the chicane. Meanwhile Leclerc has picked up his pace, presumably asked to apply the heat to Hamilton and take the pressure off his Ferrari team-mate Vettel. Lap 21/70: Verstappen locks up going into the hairpin. He is getting frustrated. Leclerc shouts the words \u201cPlan B\u201d down the team radio. Only he knows what that means. Lap 19/70: Hamilton locks up in turn 10 and damages his own slow progress. The Mercedes trails Vettel by more than two seconds. Lap 18/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 2.052sec. Leclerc, the Ferrari who remains third, has just set a new fastest lap of 1.16.533. Lap 17/70: The Renault of Nico H\u00fclkenberg is the latest to pit. He comes out behind Ricciardo after a nippy stop. Good work. Lap 16/70: Fresh from the pits, Ricciardo is determined to get amongst it. The Australian, working with a one-stop strategy, trails his former Red Bull team-mate Verstappen by almost 13secs. But Verstappen is yet to stop. Vettel and Hamilton are on mediums. Lap 15/70: A quick glance at how things are shaping up: 1 Vettel 2 Hamilton 3 Leclerc 4 H\u00fclkenberg 5 Bottas 6 Verstappen Lap 14/70: Green flag! Back to full throttle we go. Lap 12/70: Sebastien Vettel laps back marker Robert Kubica. Norris\u2019s stricken McLaren has been left to rot away from the racing line, off the track. Hamilton is 2.4sec behind the Ferrari race leader. Lap 10/70: Lando Norris\u2019s race is run! The McLaren youngster drifts into the run-off area, with his rear brakes igniting, setting fire to his rear suspension, effectively melting his hopes of a points finish. A second retirement in three races. The back of his car is sizzling, he jumps out and runs off towards safety. Out come the yellow flags. Lap 9/70: And Daniel Ricciardo follows suit. On go the hard tyres. Lap 8/70: Gasly pits, as Red Bull make their first stop of the afternoon. The hard compound tyre goes on. They are seemingly in it for the long haul. A one-stop race surely beckons. Lap 7/70: Verstappen gets his own back on Lando Norris, with the Red Bull hitting back after a frustrating start. And now Verstappen has Bottas in his sights. Back in the paddock, the Red Bull engineers applaud the 21-year-old\u2019s manoeuvre. Lap 6/70: Hamilton is getting a little frustrated over the team radio, acutely aware Vettel is already getting away from him. The Ferrari is stretching his legs, 2.076sec to the good. Lap 5/70: Leclerc sets a new fastest lap. No mucking around. Lap 4/70: Carlos Sainz flies into the pits, in and out in 3.9secs to switch on to the hard tyres. A premature stop. A replay shows it was Sergio P\u00e9rez and Giovinazzi that clattered Alexander Albon a couple of corners in, forcing him into the pits. Lap 3/70: Hamilton trails Vettel, who has just set a new fastest lap, by almost 2sec. Leclerc is chasing the Mercedes in third, followed by Ricciardo in fourth. Lap 2/70: Vettel leads Hamilton by 1.2secs. Norris zooms beyond Verstappen down the chicane as two young pretenders go head-to-head after the hairpin bend. A poor start for Red Bull. Albon is down in the pits early on, the meat in the sandwich and the Toro Rosso is relegated to last after losing his front wing. Hamilton was sluggish away in the formation lap but makes a steady start once the green flag is waved. Hamilton could feel Leclerc up the inside but kept his own racing line. Vettel leads the Canadian GP. Seventy laps to go! It is absolutely roasting in Montreal, around 30C. We are just a formation lap away from the get go in this 50th Canadian GP. Hamilton could do with it going smoothly. A gentle reminder that Kevin Magnussen starts from the pit lane after a hefty crash in Q2. Pirelli dish out some race-strategy advice. Just in the nick of time, too. \u201cA one-stopper is fastest for the 70-lap race,\u201d they say, \u201cbut there are different options. The quickest way is to start on the medium tyre and then switch to hard after 35-40 laps. The alternative strategy \u2013 which is a bit slower \u2013 is to start on the soft tyre and then go to the hard after five to eight laps. This obviously commits to an early stop though. A two-stopper is definitely slowest on paper. The optimal two-stopper would be to start on the soft tyre, switch to medium after five laps, do 32 laps on those, then take another set of mediums to the end.\u201d The screeching Canadian national anthem has been and gone, and Max Verstappen is having a chat down on the grid. \u201cOf course I would prefer to start on the front but this is also a challenge,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are still lacking a little bit but the whole team are trying to make improvements.\u201d Verstappen begins in ninth. Down on the grid, Mercedes are busy bleeding the brakes on Hamilton\u2019s car after ripping it to pieces to solve that hydraulic leak. They are confident it will all be alright on the night. Lando Norris, the McLaren who begins from eighth, says \u201ctemperatures are up from normal and it is never good when the Pirellis get hot. It is going to be a challenge but I\u2019m excited.\u201d Norris is one of several umbrella-wielding drivers donning a cooling vest and desperately trying to hide in the shade. There is a track temperature comfortably in excess of 50 degrees. It is extremely sunny out. Some appetising pre-race Hamilton soundbites. \u201cI hate losing \u2013 but you cannot sulk, you have got to move on and be tough,\u201d he says, wearing a Mr T chain necklace. \u201cI hate losing, it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s playing ping pong, the PlayStation, in my races, playing cards \u2013 I don\u2019t like losing.\u201d Less than 30 minutes until lights out. Only Michael Schumacher has a better record in Montreal than Lewis Hamilton. The Mercedes driver is on the hunt for a seventh victory at the Canadian GP, but will have to navigate a way past Vettel, who won this race last season, to do so. \u201cThe race is very long, probably a one stop so looking after the tyres is going to be really key. It\u2019s very hard to follow here, even though there\u2019s mainly straights, they are very quick on the straights. But I just hope that we are able to be close and have a real race throughout the race.\u201d Sebastien Vettel reveals his low-key celebrations after earning his first pole since last July. \u201cI went for dinner, nothing too crazy, in bed early. It is good knowing that nobody is front of you but you just hope that it stays that way. On paper I still have to be aware of the fact that Mercedes are very quick. But we looked strong yesterday for a reason, the car felt good and I believe we can fight.\u201d Panic over for Lewis Hamilton and co in the paddock: Mercedes discovered his car had a hydraulic leak after qualifying but they diagnosed the source after it left Parc Ferm\u00e9 and have since reassembled all the relevant bits and pieces. It was quite a destruction job by the engineers and mechanics, as they removed the engine and the floor. There is no penalty for Hamilton, though. He will still start from P2. His team-mate Bottas begins in sixth. 1 Vettel 2 Hamilton 3 Leclerc 4 Ricciardo 5 Gasly 6 Bottas 7 H\u00fclkenberg 8 Norris 9 Verstappen 10 Kvyat 11 Sainz Jr 12 Giovinazzi 13 Albon 14 Grosjean 15 P\u00e9rez 16 R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen 17 Stroll 18 Russell 19 Kubica 20 Magnussen It had been a long time coming \u2013 almost 12 months, in fact \u2013 but Sebastian Vettel is finally back on pole. The German did not just oust Lewis Hamilton into second spot on the grid, he demolished his lap time, earning advantage of 0.206sec \u2013 a hefty gap at Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, one of the shortest tracks on the calendar. It was only the second time in seven races Mercedes have been beaten to pole \u2013 the other by Vettel\u2019s team-mate Charles Leclerc in Bahrain in March. \u201cWe have been criticised many times this year \u2013 sometimes right, sometimes not right \u2013 but that\u2019s how it goes,\u201d Vettel said of the flak Ferrari have taken. \u201cGood result, but we want to confirm it.\u201d In other words, Vettel wants to get the job done before basking too hard, with Mercedes determined to pounce. \u201cI have to stay on his toes, keep the pressure on him, try to push him to make his tyres drop off faster than ours,\u201d said Hamilton, who leads Valtteri Bottas by 17 points in the driver\u2019s championship.

Millions of people in Sudan have joined a general strike called by pro-reform groups, shutting down cities across the country despite a wave of arrests and intimidation. The risk of migrants and refugees becoming shipwrecked in the Mediterranean and dying at sea is the highest it has been owing to a lack of rescue ships and the conflict in Libya hastening departures at an alarming rate, the UN has warned.

Opinion and analysis In 2020, Pfizer\u2019s remaining patents on Viagra expire.

Maintain appearances while everything burns.</p> \n<p>The lighting in this episode is off the scale, too. Offred\u2019s hand moving through the wisps of smoke in the corridor before she discovers the fire.

I was more than a little relieved that, when the time for castigation came, the camera left Offred in the punishment room and withdrew. We only saw the bloody soles of her feet afterwards, as she scrubbed the floor and an unknown handmaid stole a moment to whisper that her baby and Emily were safely out of Gilead. And as a reward for coming back for a third series of this brilliant but often brutal show, the final scene sees June take up her new posting with Commander Lawrence, the guy who tried to help her escape. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be any trouble, are you?\u201d he deadpans. \u201cNo, sir,\u201d she replies with the merest trace of a smile. The sound of music The episode closes with the uplifting jaunt of Good Day by Nappy Roots, a song that says we can relax and give a little air punch at all the small victories we have just witnessed. Blessed be the fruit. May the lord open. Under his eye Nick lights a cigarette for Serena and gives it to her. These tiny alliance-forging moments are crucial as the network of resistance starts to coalesce. Nick taunts June for missing her chance to get out. \u201cYou\u2019re never getting out. You\u2019re gonna fuckin\u2019 die here,\u201d he spits. You can understand his anger at June not going with their baby to Canada. That sequence featuring Serena getting into her wifely attire in the queasy green light of her bedroom is brilliant. Maintain appearances while everything burns. The lighting in this episode is off the scale, too. Offred\u2019s hand moving through the wisps of smoke in the corridor before she discovers the fire. What a feat of cinematography.",

About 100 firefighters and 15 fire engines were dispatched to deal with the blaze on De Pass Gardens that tore through wooden balconies forcing it and neighbouring flats to be evacuated. Peter Mason, chair of the Barking Reach residents\u2019 association, told the Guardian that in early May he contacted the builder Bellway Homes to ask for the fire risk to be investigated after BBC Watchdog broadcast claims of fire safety problems at two other developments by the same builder. In an email seen by the Guardian from the firm\u2019s fire safety helpline last month, Bellway told him not to worry. In a section headed Your Home it said the construction method used on the development in Scotland examined by Watchdog was different and so the Barking homes were not affected in the same way. It concluded: \u201cWe understand that these news articles are highly alarming for all residents of new homes and I hope that the above statement has allayed any fears you may have over the safety and construction of your Bellway home.\u201d Mason said he felt \u201cgut-wrenched\u201d by the fire, adding that people had lost their homes and possessions and were in severe distress. The fire appeared to rip through the wooden cladding around the balconies of the building and may have been caused by a barbecue being lit on one of the balconies, Mason said. Twenty flats were destroyed by the flames and a further 10 were damaged by heat and smoke. One man and one woman were treated at the scene after suffering from smoke inhalation. No other injuries were reported. A London ambulance service spokesperson said: \u201cWe were called at 3.32pm today to a fire in De Pass Gardens, in Barking. \u201cWe sent two ambulance crews, two solo responders and our hazardous area response team. We have a tactical commander and our command support vehicle at the scene. We also dispatched London\u2019s air ambulance.\u201d Venilia Batista Amorim, who lives opposite the flats told the Guardian: \u201cPeople started running, some said the fire alarm was not working, the sprinklers were not working, residents knocked on neighbours doors to tell them to leave. \u201cIt does not come as a surprise, so many residents are concerned.\u201d The managing agents of the block had already hired a fire warden to carry out patrols because of unspecified concerns about fire safety, Mason said. Residents who have been evacuated were advised to go to Thames View community centre on Bastable Avenue. A spokesperson for Bellway said: \u201cWe are taking the matter very seriously and working with all parties to help in establishing the cause of the fire.\u201d",

It was the biggest match of their careers but the 11 on the pitch looked out of their depth and lost.</p> <p>The buzz coming into the game had been intense, the players of course refusing to admit that who their opposition was mattered. Their first World Cup match was their own, not England\u2019s, and the narrative grew old. But there in Nice, in the scorching late afternoon sun with the humidity bordering on the unbearable, it could have been Utrecht in 2017, when England won 6-0 against Scotland. The Scots had scrambled in defence and when the Lionesses pushed against those in blue they wilted.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/09/england-scotland-womens-world-cup-match-report\">Parris and White get England off to winning start at Women\u2019s World Cup</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The formation left the team buried in their own half with Erin Cuthbert surrendered as a lone centre-forward, abandoned in attack with a sea of green grass separating her from her compatriots. It was not because it was England, it was because it was the third-ranked nation in the world and Shelley Kerr had opted for defensive banks, figuratively parking the bus. Yet it failed to work, the windscreen smashed by Parris\u2019s penalty, the high intensity and relentless press from the Lionesses enough to take the wheels off the bus.</p> <p>It was not going to be another 6-0. The team under Kerr are far too good for that. But at the Allianz Riviera the memories of Scotland\u2019s debut in the Euros came flooding back. In Scotland Women\u2019s 47-year history they had faced their southern neighbours 25 times before the World Cup, the Lionesses with 22 wins to their name, Scotland with just two, and here England looked certain to extend their advantage.</p> <p>Banked up but confusingly slack when it came to actual man\u2011marking, blue would get only so close to white before standing off and letting their bigger sisters muscle their way through. The Tartan Army remained in full voice throughout, urging their players on, but it was for nought, England\u2019s second a near hammer-blow for Scotland just before half-time.</p> <p>If Kerr demanded change, there was none to be seen on the pitch initially in the second half. The shoulders started to droop, the balmy evening stretching on ahead of the debutants. The heat began to tell and as Scotland slacked off even more, England began to ease a boot off of the gas.</p> <p>The relaxed tempo of the second half gave Scotland a chance, Kerr\u2019s substitutions combined with a desperately needed change of shape opened the game up.

      "bodyText": "A goal down fewer than 15 minutes in thanks to Nikita Parris\u2019s clinically taken spot\u2011kick, the lower\u2011ranked British nation needed to dig deep but their tanks already appeared spent. It was the biggest match of their careers but the 11 on the pitch looked out of their depth and lost. The buzz coming into the game had been intense, the players of course refusing to admit that who their opposition was mattered. Their first World Cup match was their own, not England\u2019s, and the narrative grew old. But there in Nice, in the scorching late afternoon sun with the humidity bordering on the unbearable, it could have been Utrecht in 2017, when England won 6-0 against Scotland. The Scots had scrambled in defence and when the Lionesses pushed against those in blue they wilted. The formation left the team buried in their own half with Erin Cuthbert surrendered as a lone centre-forward, abandoned in attack with a sea of green grass separating her from her compatriots. It was not because it was England, it was because it was the third-ranked nation in the world and Shelley Kerr had opted for defensive banks, figuratively parking the bus. Yet it failed to work, the windscreen smashed by Parris\u2019s penalty, the high intensity and relentless press from the Lionesses enough to take the wheels off the bus. It was not going to be another 6-0. The team under Kerr are far too good for that. But at the Allianz Riviera the memories of Scotland\u2019s debut in the Euros came flooding back. In Scotland Women\u2019s 47-year history they had faced their southern neighbours 25 times before the World Cup, the Lionesses with 22 wins to their name, Scotland with just two, and here England looked certain to extend their advantage. Banked up but confusingly slack when it came to actual man\u2011marking, blue would get only so close to white before standing off and letting their bigger sisters muscle their way through. The Tartan Army remained in full voice throughout, urging their players on, but it was for nought, England\u2019s second a near hammer-blow for Scotland just before half-time. If Kerr demanded change, there was none to be seen on the pitch initially in the second half. The shoulders started to droop, the balmy evening stretching on ahead of the debutants. The heat began to tell and as Scotland slacked off even more, England began to ease a boot off of the gas. The relaxed tempo of the second half gave Scotland a chance, Kerr\u2019s substitutions combined with a desperately needed change of shape opened the game up. Kirsty Smith and Chloe Arthur\u2019s fresh legs benefited the team but the opportunity to play Arsenal\u2019s Lisa Evans higher up was the clincher for Scotland. From the brink of humiliation, Scotland pulled themselves back with Evans the instigator. A mistake from Steph Houghton was all the encouragement the Gunner needed to open up the chance and set Claire Emslie up. She gave Scotland a lifeline and put her name down in the history books as the first female Scotland player to score at a World Cup. And the first senior Scotland player to score at the showpiece tournament since Craig Burley in 1998. The goal caused a ripple of noise at the stadium, the Tartan Army drowning out the Lionesses\u2019 fans, but with 11 minutes left on the clock and Scotland already spent, their final charge was a laborious one. The humidity had lessened over the course of the match but, forced to chase and pick themselves up time and again over the 90 minutes, the Scottish legs were heavy, flesh sun-kissed and burnt. Time fast ran out for Scotland in Nice, their first ever World Cup match one that would go down as a defeat but from 0-2 and nowhere Kerr\u2019s team had dug out a 1-2, the goal not just a galvanising one but one that could yet change the final standings of the group. With the top four third-placed teams advancing to the knockouts, Scotland slashed their goal deficit in half in one swift move. Given the nature of the team who could be vying for one of those four berths, Scotland had once again done what they can to take their destiny into their own hands, a goal at the World Cup \u2013 any goal at the World Cup \u2013 a positive to build on.

      "bodyText": "The family of an Aboriginal woman who died nine weeks ago after losing consciousness while handcuffed by police say they will bury her on Friday without knowing how she died. Cherdeena Wynne, 26, died in hospital in Perth on 9 April, five days after losing consciousness while handcuffed in circumstances that Western Australian police said were related to welfare concerns and a request for assistance from paramedics. Her family still do not know what caused her death and have been told by the coroner\u2019s office that the final report from the neurologist, necessary to determine cause of death, could take six to 12 months to complete. Wynne\u2019s grandmother, Jennifer Clayton, said the delay was compounding her family\u2019s grief. \u201cWe would like to have answers to our questions, just something to go by, before we bury Deena,\u201d she said. Clayton said her request to personally view the preliminary autopsy report had been rejected by the coroner\u2019s office, after initially being approved. In a letter to the family\u2019s lawyer, George Newhouse, on Thursday, the coroner\u2019s office granted permission for a forensic pathologist appointed by the family to speak with the forensic pathologist appointed by the court and view his report, but Guardian Australia understands the initial report does not identify a clear cause of death. Clayton said the lack of answers was exacerbating the family\u2019s distress and fuelling distrust with police and conspiracy theories about how Wynne died. \u201cWe are supposed to respect the police and trust the police,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cHow can we when these things keep happening? You wonder why our young people get angry. I am just beside myself.\u201d Police do not consider her death to be a death in custody or a death in police presence, which would trigger a mandatory inquest, but her family say they will seek a public inquest anyway. In an interview with Guardian Australia last month, the police commissioner, Chris Dawson, said the decision to hold an inquest would be made by the coroner, adding he \u201cwould ordinarily expect that that may go to inquest\u201d. Dawson said he understood \u201cthe frustration and the tension\u201d felt by families who were waiting for answers in coronial matters. \u201cClearly these [cases] have to be stepped through very, very thoroughly and we have a very strict governance over that which does prevent me from speaking with absolute clarity over all of these matters that are yet to be adjudicated by law by the coroner,\u201d he said. He also defended the decision not to investigate Wynne\u2019s death as a death in custody or police presence, saying that police attendance \u201cdoesn\u2019t axiomatically mean\u201d that police were connected to a death. Clayton said she understood that the investigation would take time but said it was insensitive for both police investigators and the coroner\u2019s court to expect the family to wait 12 months for a preliminary cause of death. \u201cWe have got to jump up and down before we get any answers and it should not be like that,\u201d she said. She said the process had not improved since her son, Wynne\u2019s father Warren Cooper, died in custody in Albany in 1999. He was also 26. Clayton is also cousin to Carol Roe, whose granddaughter, Ms Dhu, died in police custody in 2014 after enduring, as the state coroner said in findings delivered two years later, \u201cunprofessional and inhumane\u201d treatment by WA police. \u201cI have been through all this before,\u201d she said. \u201cThey had a coronial inquest, and they said \u2018wait, wait, wait\u2019, and we are still waiting. That was 20 years ago\u2026. I feel like I am trapped in limbo.\u201d Clayton called on police or the court to cut through the \u201cconfusing, difficult process\u201d and provide her with some information that could reassure or inform the family. \u201cWe are just asking for the truth,\u201d she said.

But he added: \u201cI have every reason to believe they [Mexico] will meet their commitments, so I think that will be the case, but if for whatever reason they don\u2019t, the president reserves the right to put on tariffs.\u201d</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1137329348409778177\">Trump tweet from Saturday</a>, meanwhile, continued to cause confusion. In an all-caps message, the president claimed Mexico had \u201cagreed to immediately begin buying large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers!\u201d</p> <p>But the announced deal did not contain any relevant provision. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Mexican ambassador Martha B\u00e1rcena Coqui was asked about the president\u2019s remark. She said she was \u201cabsolutely certain that the trade in agricultural goods could increase dramatically in the next few months\u201d. But she did not answer repeated questions about whether there was \u201cany kind of agreement by your government to buy agricultural products\u201d.</p> <p>B\u00e1rcena Coqui noted that Mexico is already a top US trade partner in the sector. On Saturday, foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard <a href=\"https://twitter.com/m_ebrard/status/1137547600058638338\">tweeted</a> that the deal would boost economic growth and demand for US agricultural products. He also did not say the deal contained a commitment to purchase more goods.</p> <p>Farmers in the US, usually a reliable base of Republican support, have been hit hard by Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on trade with China.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I am tired of a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies, whether it is Mexico or Canada</p> <footer> <cite>Bernie Sanders</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on Mexico met with bipartisan criticism, with Republicans in the Senate demanding the president delay his plans and meet them directly.

Lamenting what he called \u201canother false report in the Failing New York Times\u201d, he wrote: \u201cIf President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy, the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, &amp; a National Holiday would be immediately declared. \u201cWith me, despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done, no credit!\u201d The Times report said US attempts to secure a \u201csafe third country\u201d policy, giving the US the ability to reject asylum seekers if they had not sought refuge in Mexico first, had failed. In his tweets on Sunday, Trump alluded to provisions being agreed to by the two nations that were not announced on Friday. \u201cThere is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico &amp; the USA, something that didn\u2019t exist for decades,\u201d he wrote. Mexico\u2019s president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, told a rally in Tijuana on Saturday his government was \u201ccelebrating yesterday\u2019s important agreement because it was putting us in a very difficult situation with these tariffs because we would have had to impose the same measures on US products.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat follows? Keeping our commitments: reinforcing our [southern] border, applying the law and respecting the human rights\u201d of migrants. Nonetheless, the Trump administration has continued to stress it will revisit the threat of tariffs against one of its closest trading partners should its promises on the border fail to materialize. On Sunday, treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin argued on CNBC that the deal was a significant diplomatic achievement. But he added: \u201cI have every reason to believe they [Mexico] will meet their commitments, so I think that will be the case, but if for whatever reason they don\u2019t, the president reserves the right to put on tariffs.\u201d A Trump tweet from Saturday, meanwhile, continued to cause confusion. In an all-caps message, the president claimed Mexico had \u201cagreed to immediately begin buying large quantities of agricultural product from our great patriot farmers!\u201d But the announced deal did not contain any relevant provision. On CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, Mexican ambassador Martha B\u00e1rcena Coqui was asked about the president\u2019s remark. She said she was \u201cabsolutely certain that the trade in agricultural goods could increase dramatically in the next few months\u201d. But she did not answer repeated questions about whether there was \u201cany kind of agreement by your government to buy agricultural products\u201d. B\u00e1rcena Coqui noted that Mexico is already a top US trade partner in the sector. On Saturday, foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted that the deal would boost economic growth and demand for US agricultural products. He also did not say the deal contained a commitment to purchase more goods. Farmers in the US, usually a reliable base of Republican support, have been hit hard by Trump\u2019s imposition of tariffs on trade with China. Trump\u2019s threat of tariffs on Mexico met with bipartisan criticism, with Republicans in the Senate demanding the president delay his plans and meet them directly. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator running for the Democratic presidential nomination, slammed Trump for pursuing a \u201ctrade policy based on tweets\u201d. \u201cWhat the world is tired of,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s State of the Union, \u201cand what I am tired of is a president who consistently goes to war, verbal war, with our allies, whether it is Mexico, whether it is Canada.\u201d The deal with Mexico clears one obstacle from the path of the USMCA, the deal Trump negotiated to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta, in governing trade between the US, Mexico and Canada. It will still face significant hurdles in Congress. In May, US Customs and Border Protection recorded more than 132,000 apprehensions at the southern border, by far the highest number this year and a significant increase from April. The vast majority were of family groups, mostly from Central America. The US immigration court system faces historically high backlogs, with almost 900,000 cases pending. Immigration officials have complained that they lack the resources to adequately accommodate the surge amid a recent spike in child deaths in immigration custody. The Trump administration has instituted a series of hardline reforms, including an attempt to vastly curtail the rights of asylum seekers by opening the door to indefinite detention in certain cases. Sanders again urged the administration to explore bipartisan reform. \u201cTrump has been demonizing undocumented people in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is his part of his strategy of dividing us up \u2026 What we need is a border policy that is humane, that among other things, expedites the asylum process by bringing in a whole lot more legal staff and judges, so people do not have to wait.\u201d",

Lovely left-footed finish to put England two up. 8 Subs Abbie McManus (for Bright 55) 6, Karen Carney (for Mead 71) 6, Georgia Stanway (for Kirby 82) 6 Scotland 4-5-1 Lee Alexander A superb performance and had no chance on the goals. The highlight was a low save from White. 9 Sophie Howard Mead managed to get past her on a few occasions but the right-back looked composed overall. 6 Jenny Beattie A fraction late for her challenge on White for England\u2019s second. Booked for a rash challenge on Parris. 6 Rachel Corsie Strong in the air but lost out in a challenge against Kirby as England scored their second goal. 6 Nicola Docherty Had it tough against Parris and Bronze and struggled at times. Unfortunate to give away the penalty. 5 Lisa Evans Did not get into the game at first but fared better in a central role. Played a big part in Scotland\u2019s goal. 6 Christie Murray Struggled to get into the game as England dominated midfield. Taken off as Scotland chased the game. 5 Kim Little Never gave up but unable to stamp her authority on the game. Felt as if she was outnumbered. 6 Caroline Weir Was not given any time on the ball by the England midfielders. Gave the ball away too many times. 5 Claire Emslie A tough game for the Orlando Pride wide player but improved in the second half and took her goal well. 6 Erin Cuthbert Chased relentlessly throughout but her best chance, towards the end of the first half, went just wide. 7 Subs Kirsty Smith (for Docherty 54) 7, Chloe Arthur (for Howard 74) 6, Lizzie Arnot (for Murray 87) n/a",

Perhaps the other 21 per cent were on-sold to Indian fans by savvy Australians who saw a chance to quadruple their money? That\u2019s the best explanation that I can think of. I doubt they\u2019ll boo Smith and Warner, right? <br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfd0cfc8f0895eae95134ae\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/adam-collins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T13:43:39.630Z\">2.43pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Thanks, JP! Great to have you back. </strong>Well, that was exactly as they planned it.<strong> </strong>No team in this tournament sticks to their plan quite like India. No matter what, they set up solidly. No mucking around. No audacious power-play antics. Instead of easing into the accumulation phase, this is when the turn up the volume, notch by notch, until the final ten. Then, with maximum flexibility and plenty of big hitters in the shed, it is party time. Every India batsman played their role to perfection in this after winning the chance to bat first. On a worn pitch, 352 is loads. Especially with Chahal and Kuldeep at Kohli\u2019s disposal. In short, this is going to take something extraordinary from Australia. <strong><br></strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfd08398f08ff012e2711f7\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jonathan-howcroft\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T13:34:12.052Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">India 352-5</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australia will have to break all manner of records if they are going to remain unbeaten in the 2019 Cricket World Cup after India methodically posted an intimidating 352-5 at the Oval. </p> <p>After Virat Kohli won the toss and made the straightforward decision to bat first on a dry and wearing surface his openers put on a measured 127-run stand to afford India control of their destiny. Shikhar Dhawan played through the pain of a damaged thumb to top score with 117 while Rohit Sharma\u2019s 57 helped see off the new ball threat of Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. </p> <p>At 220-2 after 37 overs India\u2019s innings could have lost momentum and the big score on offer sidestepped. Hardik Pandya\u2019s blistering 48 and MS Dhoni\u2019s quick-fire 27 ensured that would not be the case and along with Kohli\u2019s typically assured 82 India posted the highest ever total against an Australian side at a World Cup.</p> <p>Australia\u2019s attack was ill-suited to a confusing Oval pitch. There was a hint of menace with the new ball but little bounce and no sideways movement. How much assistance it offered spin was hard to tell with Adam Zampa bowling poorly and Nathan Lyon not selected. Six bowlers each bowled at least six overs as Aaron Finch chopped and changed in the hope of breakthroughs that rarely came. </p> <p>Australia now have a mountain to climb but in this new era of massive ODI chases it is far from insurmountable.

Still an age away from the business end of this competition neither side will want to cede the psychological advantage.</p> <p>India are still feeling their way having taken their opening bow much later than their rivals and they have a score to settle with Australia having suffered three consecutive ODI defeats on home soil to the defending champions in preparation for this World Cup. </p> <p>Those Australian victories have proven the catalyst for a remarkable turnaround in form. A miserable record of eight wins in 33 ODIs and confusion over selection and strategy has been replaced by ten wins on the spin, accompanied by big names back in the side and bang in form. It\u2019s the Australian cricket team at a World Cup, would you expect anything less?</p> <p>The highlights of this tournament will be the big hits and massive scores but beneath those gaudy figures it remains the bowlers who will determine many results. Even if the numbers don\u2019t look pretty at first glance, once we acclimatise to this brave new world a semblance of order will appear. Today for example the gloriously free-scoring Oval may well host all manner of eye-watering records but the duel between Jasprit Bumrah and Mitchell Starc may well prove decisive. Both pacemen take wickets early and often and both are a slogger\u2019s nightmare at the death. </p> <p>Anyhow, with play to begin in about an hour (10.30am local / 7.30pm AET) there\u2019s plenty more time to consider what\u2019s ahead of us.</p> <p>As always, if you want to join in - and I encourage you to do so - please send me an <a href=\"mailto:jonathan.howcroft.freelance@theguardian.com\">email</a> or a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JPHowcroft\">tweet</a> at your convenience. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4614a74a3be43086141cc2f580f69892d858c5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4614a74a3be43086141cc2f580f69892d858c5a/0_0_3668_2445/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Can Australia cope with Jasprit Bumrah\u2019s hostility?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can Australia cope with Jasprit Bumrah\u2019s hostility?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "And check out the latest standings, which show India are now up to third \u2026 That\u2019s all from The Oval. Thanks for your fanastic company, as always. We\u2019ll be back with the OBO tomorrow morning and every day of the World Cup. G\u2019night! Virat Kohli speaks. \u201cAbsolutely proud of the win. A top win for us. After losing that series in India we had a point to prove. We came here with intent from ball one when we were batting. The opening partnership was outstanding. It was absolutely the perfect game for us and with the ball it was an absolutely brilliant start. We were very professional and that always pleases me as a captain.\u201d Enjoyed Pandya\u2019s hitting, MSD at the end. \u201cWe played the way we wanted to play.\u201d Aaron Finch speaks. \u201cThey got 120 in the final ten over, which is a lot. We didn\u2019t bowl out best stuff. We struggled to get wickets early on, that was the key. With experienced guys they had coming in, it made it tough. I think being a used surface didn\u2019t help with the new ball there wasn\u2019t a lot on offer earlier. But we could have been more back of a length early. But they bat very deep. They just outplayed us.\u201d He also backed in David Warner. We\u2019ll be back with the captains in a sec. Kohli and Finch are making their way to the middle for the presentation. Shikhar Dhawan is player of the match or his 117. \u201cAbsolutely happy with that result. It is a great team effort, which is a great sign for the team. Very happy with the all-over performance. We are a great fielding side as well. We have a very balanced side with fast bowlers and spinners. I am happy to be part of it. We work really hard in the nets and that is why it is going our way as well.\u201d Never in doubt. Australia finish with a healthy 316 but they never were really in the chase, aside from about 10 minutes when Maxwell and Smith were together. The Australians didn\u2019t go hard enough early. Or perhaps better put: India bowled so well, they couldn\u2019t get away. Warner faced 48 dot balls in his innings of 56, for instance. Bumrah and Bhuvi, then Chahal especially, were just too good. Smith (69), Khawaja (42) and Maxwell (28) all had moments - and Carey (55 not out) was excellent at the end - but the task was too great. India worthy winners. There it is! Zampa spoons the final ball of the innings to extra cover, giving Bhuvi a well-earned third wicket. A fantastic performance from the men in blue. Bhuvi does well to collect a throw from the sub Shankar at deep cover. The third umpire confirms that Starc is about a metre short. 49th over: Australia 312-8 (Carey 52, Starc 3) Target 353 Bumrah gets through the 49th over of the innings with a series of slower balls and accurate yorkers. Just the one run off the bat, two byes coming as well when he beats Dhoni. Too good. 48th over: Australia 309-8 (Carey 51, Starc 3) Target 353 Shot. Carey pulls Bhuvi hard out to midwicket for four and follows it with a glance that takes him to a half-century in 25 balls - the fastest of this World Cup. We Will Rock You plays around The Oval between overs and the Indian fans can\u2019t get enough of it. They\u2019ve had quite the South London day out. This is a fine win they are about to celebrate. After carving Bumrah behind point for four earlier in the over, Cummins falls to the Indian attack leader when trying to launch him into the next postcode, tickling his slower ball through to Dhoni. Not far away now. 47th over: Australia 300-8 (Carey 45) Target 353 \u201cI know I\u2019m banging on unceasingly about the new rigour India have been rocking recently,\u201d writes Robert Wilson. I don\u2019t mind, if it helps me work out how I\u2019m going to bash out 1000 words later tonight. \u201cBut there\u2019s been a mistaken air of perplexity and mystification about the shape of this game in both innings. It\u2019s all going to plan. The simple rule is if you think there\u2019s something going on, there\u2019s quite often something going on. People forget about the Windies heyday. Yes, there was flash and dash but it was also getting the foot on the throat early, relaxing those hammies and just staying in that inexorable and devastating posture until the oppo\u2019s life and hope ebbed away. India have controlled this game utterly. They\u2019re Jack Palance in a hotel room with an attach\u00e9 case in a 1970s B-movie. Can\u2019t you hear the Quincy Jones soundtrack as they emotionlessly assemble the sniper rifle?\u201d Okay, this is great. Next: can you get to the bottom of why every TV commentator identifies Pat Cummins Pat CumminGs? What\u2019s going on there? 46th over: Australia 291-7 (Carey 43, Cummins 1) Target 353 Carey is showing plenty. Granted, his dropping of Hardik Pandya from the first ball he faced is more important in the final analysis than the runs he is adding, but still, it\u2019s a long competition and he is playing an important role at No7. A well timed slap over cover, picking up Bhuvi from well outside the off-stump, takes him into the 40s. 45th over: Australia 284-7 (Carey 37, Cummins 0) Target 353 Earlier the over, it was all going so well for Australia when Carey uppercut the first ball of Bumrah\u2019s over for four. But along with the wicket, only two further singles came. They now need 69 from 30. Michael Slater still thinks they\u2019ll win, for what that\u2019s worth. Fascinating email in from Kandukuru Nagarjun that I wish I had more time to engage with. \u201cNever mind one song,\u201d he says, \u201cour Usman\u2019s name cues a whole genre: mystical Sufi music popular in Pakistan, India and several other countries influenced by the Ottomans and Persians. The word \u2018Khawaja\u2019 means \u2018Sufi tutor\u2019 in Persian and features in countless songs of the genre. Here are two masterful ones: A Nusrat Ali KhanAn AR RahmanThe Rahman one (in Urdu/Hindi) starts like this. Loose translation: Oh Khawaja, my lord, helper of the poor, helper of the faith, come reside in my heart... Khwajaji, Khwaja Khwajaji, Khwaja, Khwaja Ji Ya Gharib Nawaz Ya Gharib Nawaz Ya Gharib Nawaz Ya Moinuddin, Ya Khwaja Ji Ya Khwaja Ji Ya Khwaja Ji Ya Khwaja Ji Ya Khwaja Ji\u201d Kohli gives it BIG after taking a well-struck NCN swipe at midwicket on the rope. Bumrah gets him with the slower ball, fingers run down the seam. Good bowling. 44th over: Australia 278-6 (Carey 31, Coulter-Nile 4) Target 353 Hardik has one over left, and Kohli is giving it to him, I assume, so that Kuldeep doesn\u2019t need to bowl his 10th at the death. Working around the field in 1s and 2s until the fifth delivery, Carey again nailed a strike down the ground as he did in the previous set, this time for four. Nine off it, which is still short of where they need to be but keeping Australia just within touching distance. They need 75 from 36. 43rd over: Australia 269-6 (Carey 23, Coulter-Nile 3) Target 353 Well, they need 12 an over and Carey just took 13 from Chahal\u2019s 10th, finishing with 2/62 including the huge wicket of Maxwell. He got them with a fine slog sweep for four and a mighty strike over the legspinner\u2019s head into the pavilion. He\u2019s 23 off 10 balls. 42nd over: Australia 256-6 (Carey 10, Coulter-Nile 3) Target 353 Nine off the Bumrah over, helped by Jadeja when taking a ping when Carey who took him on at backward point. Missing the stumps (for one in his life) the ball ran away for four overthrows. Two a ball required for Australia, if you were wondering. Back to our topic before all hell broke loose? \u201cThe most obvious earworm in relation to this game has to be Public Enemy Yo! Bumrah-sh the Show,\u201d suggests Adam Levine. \u201cHow about Adele belting out Rolling in Kuldeep?\u201d emails Brian Withington. \u201cThe Australian batsman certainly haven\u2019t been able to do much with him.\u201d Very good. 41st over: Australia 247-6 (Carey 4, Coulter-Nile 0) Target 353 Another great bowling change from Kohli, no doubt knowing the ridiculous record Chahal has when it comes to Maxwell. There\u2019s nearly a second wicket to finish the succesful over, NCN racing to the danger end when Carey called him through for two through midwicket. The throw misses and West Australian survives. Sorry I haven\u2019t been able to get to your emails over the last half an hour or so - too much going on in front of me. I\u2019ll do my best to triage in an over or two. No, THAT is the loudest roar of the day! DEAFENING as Maxwell holes out to midwicket, trying to register a second boundary for the over but picking out the wrong man with a skied hoick, Jadeja, on as a sub. Game over. Bowled him! Second ball. The crowd go absolutely WILD in the stands. One precondition for a Maxwell Miracle was having an established player riding shotgun with him but that\u2019s not happening now. Bhuvi went through Stoinis between bat and pad, who didn\u2019t move his feet at all. Poor dismissal. 40th over: Australia 238-5 (Maxwell 23) Target 353 Smith has missed Bhuvi\u2019s off-cutter when trying to work him through midwicket, struck on the knee roll. Given not out, Kohli had no hesitation sending it upstairs. The technology confirmed the former captain\u2019s fate. Very, very out. 39th over: Australia 235-3 (Smith 68, Maxwell 21) Target 353 Another big over, off the main man Bumrah. Maxwell as opened the door and Smith is walking through it. The former\u2019s strike through midwicket to begin got the ball rolling, picking up the length early and smashing it to the Peter May Stand. Giving the strike back to Smith, he has a pop at the fourth ball and is rewarded for it, his inside edge running away for four. He somehow manages to get the last one away too, a bumper aimed at his lid. 13 from it. Maxwell has 21 from 9. 38th over: Australia 222-3 (Smith 60, Maxwell 16) Target 353 Maxwell begins his innings with three boundaries in four balls. It is Bhuvi who cops it, back into the attack and cut hard to the gap at backward point. SHOT. Next up: a gorgeous glide beating third man to the rope. He keeps going, two more to square leg. He misses Bhuvi\u2019s slower ball but hammers a pull shot, albeit to the fielder on the rope. Smith\u2019s turn, who glances perfectly to the fine leg boundary. That\u2019s 15 from the over, if you don\u2019t mind. The Indian fans know as well as anyone what Maxwell could do here if it comes together in the final ten overs. Don\u2019t go anywhere. 37th over: Australia 207-3 (Smith 56, Maxwell 5) Target 353 Here is the thing: Maxwell will believe he can win it. There\u2019s no doubt about that; it is just how he is built. Reflecting this, he smashes Bumrah straight back down the ground for four. What a shot. Amusingly, as he told us when talking to him before the tournament, he doesn\u2019t do any gym work. His power is all a product of natural timing. Freak. What an option for Kohli to turn to after a good over for Australia: the top-ranked ODI bowler in the world, Jasprit Bumrah. And he\u2019s in the game within four balls, castling Khawaja when the left-hander tried and failed to lap him over fine leg. The crowd to my left are as loud now as they have been at any time today. They can sense how close India are to victory now. Then again, here comes Maxwell. 36th over: Australia 201-2 (Smith 55, Khawaja 42) Target 353 Well, Khawaja goes bang/bang. Kuldeep is the man they are going after. Taking on his stock ball spinning away from him, the left-hander gets down on one knee to slog sweep him into the grandstand. And he does again, albeit along the ground and a fraction squarer, this time for four! With four more picked up along the way, the over is worth 14 for Australia, which keeps the rate required south of 11. That\u2019s not for nothing. The final shot from Khawaja, two over cover, also raises the 200. 35th over: Australia 187-2 (Smith 54, Khawaja 29) Target 353 I like this from Kohli, getting Pandya back on to shake things up after boundaries from each of the last three overs from spin. Oh, scrap that: Khawaja has got stuck into an impotent short ball, creaming it through midwicket out to the Bedser Stand for four. The good news for India is that they have now exhausted the overs that they require from their fifth bowler. Bumrah and Bhuvi will be back soon enough. 34th over: Australia 180-2 (Smith 53 Khawaja 24) Target 353 Ending the Kuldeep over with with a lovely cover-driven boundary, Smith records his second half century in a row from 60 balls. Kuldeep has 0/41 from his eight. Nothing wrong with that at all. Who will Australia target? They have to take someone down. 33rd over: Australia 172-2 (Smith 47, Khawaja 22) Target 353 Boundaries in consecutive overs for Khawaja, sweeping and sweeping well. Chahal bounces back well, denying him a second chance to find the rope. Drinks! The required rate is 10.65; still 181 runs left to collect, more than what they currently have in 33 overs. 32nd over: Australia 165-2 (Smith 45, Khawaja 17) Target 353 Kuldeep has Khawaja on the rack until the final delivery, when the left-hander is able to, at last, lift him over fine leg for four. He made it possible getting across his stumps to create something. There has to be more of that over the next few overs to keep them vaguely in touch. Still, only six from it. 31st over: Australia 159-2 (Smith 44, Khawaja 12) Target 353 Dhoni stumping chance! He\u2019s up after Smith\u2019s inside edge ends up with him, removing the bails as the former Australian captain dives back. TV confirms that he\u2019s safe - just. MS was involved in saving runs earlier in the over too, off his helmet, when Khawaja\u2019s reverse crashed into it. Four off it. What does Smith do next? It has to be him. 30th over: Australia 155-2 (Smith 42, Khawaja 10) Target 353 The crowd are cheering every ball, Kuldeep brought back and keeping Smith quiet with four dots through the middle of the over, landing his stock delivery in a dangerous channel time and again. He gets on to one pull shot but Kohli - shuffled back onto the circle by Dhoni, Clarke observes - has enough time to stop it. Two off it. Fantastic bowling. I said in my first post today that the Indian plan with the bat was executed to perfection. Their squeeze with the ball is going much the same way. They now need more than 10 an over to win. Wouldn\u2019t have thought so. 29th over: Australia 153-2 (Smith 41, Khawaja 9) Target 353 Chahal does it again. Smith misses his sweep before giving the strike to Khawaja. The Queensland captain is very lucky not to give a catch back to the leggie off his leading edge, getting two instead. Smith picks out fielders on the circle from the final two deliveries, making just four from it. This chase is drowning. 28th over: Australia 149-2 (Smith 40, Khawaja 6) Target 353 Brilliant from KL Rahul, ensuring that another over elapses without a boundary by putting in a magnificent one-handed dive on the deep cover rope. Smith is trying his hardest to creates something - anything - by moving around the crease, but the shots aren\u2019t bisecting the sweepers. 26 runs have been scored from the last five overs; Pandya just one further to bowl before Kohli can rotate between his top four. 27th over: Australia 144-2 (Smith 36, Khawaja 5) Target 353 In fairness to Khawaja, this is not an easy time to walk out. He\u2019s resourceful here, using the pace of Chahal to paddle a couple fine. But other than that, with three singles to the sweepers, it is another over with only five from it. With that, the required rate inches up to 9.2. Romeo informs me that Australia aren\u2019t in as much trouble as Notts, who are all out for 162 with Kyle Abbott snaring 6/37 for Hampshire. I\u2019ll take his word for it! 26th over: Australia 139-2 (Smith 34, Khawaja 2) Target 353 Five singles off Pandya. More importantly, that\u2019s the seventh over he\u2019s bowled. Add Jadhav\u2019s, and Kohli is only two away from having his fifth bowler dealt with before over 30. Top captaincy. \u201cI\u2019ll happily help out with your choice of music for the above, Collo,\u201d offers Iain McKane. \u201cWe could set up the South London equivalent of Chicky\u2019s Disco at the old Antigua Rec. I\u2019m sure your pop-tastic young-person\u2019s taste will leaven my heady mix of metalcore, \u201860s garage blues, and free-jazz into something palatable for the groovy Vauxhall cognoscenti.\u201d I\u2019ve always said that this is the role I was born to play. 25th over: Australia 134-2 (Smith 31, Khawaja 0) Target 353 Khawaja, not known for his brisk scoring outside of the power play, joins Smith. He doesn\u2019t have long to find his stride here. Not when the required rate is already at 9s. Chahal is spun around to the pavilion end and it works! Coming down the track to take on the leggie against the wind, Warner doesn\u2019t get all of it and Bhuvi is out on the rope to take the straightforward outfield chance. The end of an unflattering innings for the Australian opener. They\u2019re in big strife. 24th over: Australia 127-1 (Warner 56, Smith 27) Target 353 Kohli is trying to get through this fifth bowler overs as quickly as possible, throwing the ball back to Pandya for his sith. Warner times a potent pull shot into the gap but a boundary is prevented by some tag-team ground fielding on the rope out there. That aside, it\u2019s another relaxed over where both sides seem happy to allow about a run a ball to be added for the time being. Who do Australia bring in next? \u201cAfternoon, Adam.\u201d G\u2019day, Phil Sawyer. \u201cI can\u2019t believe no-one has mentioned Ba-Ba-Ba-BaBar Azam.\u201d [Ted Hastings] Now we\u2019re cooking with gas. [/Ted Hastings] 23rd over: Australia 121-1 (Warner 51, Smith 26) Target 353 Okay, another crucial mini-period of this game with Jadhav into the attack with his side-arm nothings. Kohli is so clever in the way that he uses him, always when the pressure is on the opposition. But Smith knows his feet are fast enough to deal with any challenge this bowler presents and charges him accordingly, launching over long-on FOR SIX! They needed that. Helped by two legside wides, with the pressure now back on the pint-sized all-rounder, Smith gets down low to smash him through midwicket to slog-sweep four more! 15 from the over. Might that be the opening? 22nd over: Australia 107-1 (Warner 50, Smith 15) Target 353 That has to be Warner\u2019s slowest half-century in ODIs, taking 76 to reach the mark. More important for India is that Chahal has raced through another over giving away just two singles. The required rate is now 8.8 runs an over. As I said an hour ago, this is perfectly set up for Maxwell to be the scapegoat, coming in with 10s needed. 21st over: Australia105-1 (Warner 49, Smith 14) Target 353 Bumrah\u2019s back for a second burst, having bowled just three overs in his opening spell. And Warner enjoys the pace on the ball, carving the first legal delivery (following a misdirected bumper) over the cordon. There\u2019s not a lot going on for Australia thereafter, Bumrah on top with both his accurate slower ball and much faster bouncer, which hits Smith in his stomach/chest. Ouch. It\u2019s very, very dark at The Oval now. 20th over: Australia 99-1 (Warner 45, Smith 14) Target 353 The DLS par score is 118 after 20 overs, which isn\u2019t a bad guide to how far the Australians are behind the chase. At this stage, it\u2019ll suit Kohli and Chahal for five singles to be taken from the leggie, mostly down the ground. They\u2019re doing a fine job in defence of their total. \u201cIt may be that because there is an electric circuit to the bails from the stumps, they are actually attracted to the stumps and hence harder to knock off,\u201d Phillip Haran theorises. \u201cGiven everything else about them is the same, I think it most likely!\u201d I\u2019m going to get to the bottom of this after the game. 19th over: Australia 94-1 (Warner 42, Smith 12) Target 353 Warner gets a long-hop from Kuldeep first up and helps himself to four through cover. \u2018Who Let The Dogs Out?\u2019 plays around the ground. Hmm. As I\u2019ve said to Surrey several times, I\u2019m ready and willing to take over as the Cricket Ground DJ here at a moment\u2019s notice. Three singles are added in the usual middle-overs fashion, Kuldeep mixing that up with a flighted leg break that Warner elects not to go after. No rain scheduled until 8pm tonight, the TV commentary says. Good. It sure is chilly, though. 18th over: Australia 87-1 (Warner 36, Smith 11) Target 353 Chahal\u2019s turn, which Smith doesn\u2019t mind at all when taking two through the gap at cover from his first ball and two more through the midwicket region from the second. This is a bowler who has plenty of experience bowling Australia out, so they would have prepared well for his overs, I am sure. Warner adds two later in the over as well, sweeping off his glove into Dhoni\u2019s pad - well away from his gloves. By the way, is anyone keeping their eyes on his gloves? I assume he\u2019s followed the ICC\u2019s orders? 17th over: Australia 79-1 (Warner 33, Smith 6) Target 353 Four off this accurate Kuldeep over, the Australians happy enough taking the singles on offer to sweepers square of the wicket and down the ground. No risks. \u201cWarner looks well off his stride here,\u201d observes Bob Wilson. \u201cA mix of his form and some really strangly bowling. Given his \u2018temperament\u2019, he\u2019s bound to go all hormonal about it in a minute. Which will produce fireworks in one of two directions. Either way, a spectator win. I still do love watching him emote.\u201d Notwithstanding what went down in South Africa last year, he is very zen these days. For better or worse. Mind you, a bit of Old Davey Warner might be required as far as launching some sixes over cow corner. Not quite yet, though. 16th over: Australia 75-1 (Warner 31, Smith 4) Target 353 Bad from Pandya to begin, overstepping from around the wicket at Warner who has a crack at the short ball, pulling it for four! He doesn\u2019t make the most of the free hit that follows but it can only help the opener\u2019s confidence. Pandya is back over the wicket at flings down a short ball that keeps Warner thinking. One, two, three singles finish the final over as they head into the drinks break. They now need 8.18 an over. \u201cSmith and Warner BARELY SCRATCHING THE SURFACE of this RRR,\u201d lols Scott Oliver. \u201cYes, I know. Sorry.\u201d Fair play. I\u2019ve seen plenty worse. At the drinks break they have a band playing Waltzing Matilda. Yeah, that might have worked if more than about 30 Australians were in the crowd right now. 15th over: Australia 67-1 (Warner 25, Smith 3) Target 353 Kuldeep nearly wins the wicket of Warner off an inside edge, that is provided the bails would have fallen off anyway. The former leadership axis exchange singles through the legside, the southpaw then keeping the strike with one down the ground. Steve V has arrived in my inbox with his earworm. \u201cSomethin\u2019 strange In ya neighbourhood Who ya gonna call? JOS BUTTLER!!!\u201d Very good. Michael Lacquiere has one too. \u201cFor a couple of decades the names Andy Caddick and Nasser Hussain have pleasingly brought to mind the lyrics of that fabled cricket anthem \u201cBreathe\u201d by their natural musical soulmates, The Prodigy - as in \u201cPsycho somatic, Caddick Hussain\u201d. You\u2019re welcome!\u201d I LOVE THIS. 14th over: Australia 63-1 (Warner 23, Smith 1) Target 353 Smith joins Warner after the blunder instead of Khawaja, which is interesting but logical. He remains Australia\u2019s best player, so it makes sense. Watching the replay back, Finch did hesitate when turning. As Clarke observes on telly, Warner was coming back for two from the moment he hit it. Where will Khawaja bat? Harsha Bhogle asks that of Clarke, who replies \u201cJust after Coulter-Nile.\u201d [Snake emoji]. Smith is off the mark from the final ball of Pandya\u2019s over, tucking him around the corner. What a throw from Jadhav at deep point, Finch left a foot short at the non-strikers\u2019 end coming back for a second after Warner creamed his square drive. Oh dear. 13th over: Australia 59-0 (Warner 21, Finch 36) Target 353 \u201cSomething is going to give,\u201d says Michael Clarke. He predicts that Finch hits some sixes or one of these two get out shortly. Neither here, the Australian pair happy to take six risk-free runs, most of those off the front foot down the ground where there are two sweepers. Clarke also speculates that they might promote Maxwell to three. Not completely out of the question. Warner is 21 off 43, in case you were wondering. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the Aussies are doing here,\u201d writes Avitaj Mitra. \u201cYou \u2018consolidate\u2019 and the required rate goes from 7 to 8.5 or 9. Then when Maxwell comes in, he\u2019s got to go straight away and if he gets out cheaply, he\u2019s a convenient scapegoat. I know the Indians are bowling very accurately but surely there\u2019s got to be some sort of intent.\u201d Not wrong. All the hallmarks of a Maxwell The Villain afternoon coming up. On a lighter note. \u201cEvery time Graham Onions gets a mention I get a full Booker T and the MG\u2019s groove on,\u201d reveals Adam Levine. 12th over: Australia 53-0 (Warner 19, Finch 32) Target 353 Great fightback from Pandya, keeping Warner quiet from around the wicket, mixing up his lengths at the Australian opener. Also astute captaincy from Kohli for persisting with him. 11th over: Australia 52-0 (Warner 19, Finch 31) Target 353 As usual, Kohli turns to spin as soon as the first ten overs are complete, the left-armer Kuldeep given the first opportunity today. Warner is watchful, driving him along the ground for an easy single, Finch then striking in the same direction for a couple. Good batting. He keeps the strike with a tuck around the corner. This is such an important period of Australia\u2019s chase. With at least 20 to 25 overs of spin coming their way, they have to find a way to take them down to have any chance of getting these runs. 10th over: Australia 48-0 (Warner 18, Finch 28) Target 353 Shot! Pandya is bowling the final over of the power play and misdirects at Warner from around the wicket to begin, the opener helping it on its way to the fine leg boundary. Pandya bites back with the next one, getting a ball to take off from a length into the gloves of Warner. That stings. Giving the strike to Finch, the captain waits on a delivery short of a length to heave it over midwicket for SIX! The first big one of the innings, flat and hard. He goes again from the fifth ball, crunching him past point from the balls of his feet. Four more! And again from the final offering of the power play, smashing him from the back foot through extra cover to make 19 from the over. A lot of good work undone there. They end the opening stanza in fine form. 9th over: Australia 29-0 (Warner 13, Finch 14) Target 353 Bhuvi is so consistent. They are able to score off four of the deliveries but all with pushes along the carpet from the stumps. Nothing to slap at, that\u2019s for sure. He has 0/12 from his five. 8th over: Australia 24-0 (Warner 9, Finch 13) Target 353 Hardik Pandya is on to replace Bumrah are quality overs from him. Pandya has the ability to bowl some very nasty short stuff, and after his excellent cameo with the bat at No4 he will he will be backing himself. Yep, he\u2019s into Finch\u2019s chest after a couple of balls, but played well. Warner then takes one to point, Finch turning a couple around the corner that had him scampering back to the danger end. \u201cWhen will Australia take them?\u201d asks Michael Clarke on TV. They do need to shift some pressure back the way of India sooner rather than later. A tweet in from Dan Guidone is on-point to begin: \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be the one that saves me.... AND AFTER ALLLLLLLLLLLL.... #chanderpaul\u201d \u201cIshant Sharma\u2019s gonna get you!\u201d adds Ben Broughton, a reminder of old OBO times. And Brian Withington has some thoughts to share on zing bails. \u201cAre we moving into a baseball type format where it\u2019s three strikes and you\u2019re out? Puts one in mind of the old WG Grace anecdote where the great man avoided the early inconvenience of being blatantly caught behind by browbeating the umpire, pointing out that people had paid their money to see him bat. When eventually dismissed by being comprehensively clean bowled, the wicketkeeper politely enquired why his lordship was leaving given that there was still one stump in the ground. Allegedly.\u201d Quite. Allegedly. The point made on TV is that bails were original there to help the umpire determine of the stump was it. Can\u2019t sensor technology do that now? 7th over: Australia 19-0 (Warner 8, Finch 10) Target 353 Might it rain? Since moving down to this seat at the lunch break, I am sure the temperature has dropped several degrees. It nearly goes up again from the last ball of this Bhuvi over when Finch left himself exposed at the non-strikers\u2019 end! Warner chopped onto his pad and started running, his captain following. He was sent back but it wouldn\u2019t have mattered had Kohli\u2019s throw been on target. It was a great pick-up and chuck at full pace and not far away at all. The only run from the set came at the start when Finch pushed to cover. Warner has faced 25 balls for his eight, which is more about the superb start from this brilliant pair of Indian seamers. 6th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 8, Finch 9) Target 353 Bumrah to Warner, the man he bowled first ball. Anyway. There is a lot of respect here, the left-hander failing to execute a pull shot from the first ball, so he defended and left the rest. No inch given. Maiden. \u201cSurely this has been mentioned but if not,\u201d emails Peter Gibbs, \u201ccan you ask if there are other examples of where a cricketer\u2019s name gives one an earworm? In the same way that Shikhar Dhawanhas me singing Brick House by the Commodores on account of sounding like the lyrics: \u201cShake it down, shake it down now\u201d I even try to do it with the Walter \u201cClyde\u201d Orange twang. (specifically at 2m06s but ..treat yourself to some late 70s funk ( and a share of my earworm pain).\u201d Excellent, excellent OBO areas. Hit me up. Name a player that does the same for you? For me, it\u2019s Rabada. As in (and I\u2019ve done this on the OBO many times). \u201cRabada\u2019s back and you\u2019re gonna be in trouble, Hey-la-day-la my Rabada\u2019s back.\u201d 5th over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 8, Finch 9) Target 353 Finch is playing Bhuvi well too, defending with a nice straight bat throughout. The Indian seamer misses his mark down leg with a slower one but is immediately back in his happy place. A savvy dive from Rohit at cover denies the right-hander a couple to finish. Both sets of openers just feeling each other out here; no major moves yet. Top contest. 4th over: Australia 17-0 (Warner 8, Finch 9) Target 353 Right, Bumrah vs Finch - the contest the Indians want. And it doesn\u2019t take long to find his inside edge, either. A couple of runs are added to the Australian tally but that\u2019s a win for Bumrah, who went through Finch\u2019s gate so routinely last summer. He fights back well, though, clipping a boundary with expert timing past the square leg umpire for his first four of the chase. He then keeps the strike with a nice deflection to third man. He\u2019ll leave that over with a degree of confidence against his nemesis. 3rd over: Australia 10-0 (Warner 8, Finch 2) Target 353 Bhuvi is into his groove immediately, beating Warner with one that decked away from an ideal length. He\u2019s such a classy bowler. A single to cover becomes two when Kohli has a ping, as you would expect from the Indian No1. Warner deals with the rest cautiously. 2nd over: Australia 8-0 (Warner 6, Finch 2) Target 353 Surely NOT AGAIN? For the fifth time in the tournament the stumps have been hit with the zing bails not coming off. This is crazy. Bumrah deserves to have Warner first ball of his spell, chopping on awkwardly with the ball rolling back into the leg stump. It moved by the bail didn\u2019t. How can this go on? The ICC must step in. Benefitting from the let off, Warner plays the shot that nets him the bulk of his boundaries nowadays, timing through cover from the balls of his feet for his first four. 1st over: Australia 3-0 (Warner 1, Finch 2) Target 353 \u201cNO RUN!\u201d roars Warner in his familiar way when pushing the first ball of the reply to cover. He\u2019s away two balls later with a clip for one to midwicket. Finch gets on the front dog first ball, driving dead straight into the stumps, taking some pace of the ball to deny him a boundary but they come back for two. Confident start. But the real test for the captain will be against Bumrah, who owned him during the southern summer. The players are on the field. Nup, no booing for Warner. Not really. He\u2019s taking the first ball this time around instead of the captain Finch. Bhuvi has the ball in his hand, starting off from the pavilion end. I\u2019m sitting in the outside press box tribunes and it is LOUD. Should be fun. PLAY! It is a bit of a cliche to say that every India game is a home game. But goodness me, this is a HOME GAME. From memory, some 300,000 Australians live in London but there aren\u2019t many here today. It\u2019s a sea of blue, to lean on a second cliche in the space of a paragraph. 79 per cent of tickets went to Indian fans for this fixture, I\u2019m told. Perhaps the other 21 per cent were on-sold to Indian fans by savvy Australians who saw a chance to quadruple their money? That\u2019s the best explanation that I can think of. I doubt they\u2019ll boo Smith and Warner, right? Thanks, JP! Great to have you back. Well, that was exactly as they planned it. No team in this tournament sticks to their plan quite like India. No matter what, they set up solidly. No mucking around. No audacious power-play antics. Instead of easing into the accumulation phase, this is when the turn up the volume, notch by notch, until the final ten. Then, with maximum flexibility and plenty of big hitters in the shed, it is party time. Every India batsman played their role to perfection in this after winning the chance to bat first. On a worn pitch, 352 is loads. Especially with Chahal and Kuldeep at Kohli\u2019s disposal. In short, this is going to take something extraordinary from Australia. Australia will have to break all manner of records if they are going to remain unbeaten in the 2019 Cricket World Cup after India methodically posted an intimidating 352-5 at the Oval. After Virat Kohli won the toss and made the straightforward decision to bat first on a dry and wearing surface his openers put on a measured 127-run stand to afford India control of their destiny. Shikhar Dhawan played through the pain of a damaged thumb to top score with 117 while Rohit Sharma\u2019s 57 helped see off the new ball threat of Pat Cummins and Mitchell Starc. At 220-2 after 37 overs India\u2019s innings could have lost momentum and the big score on offer sidestepped. Hardik Pandya\u2019s blistering 48 and MS Dhoni\u2019s quick-fire 27 ensured that would not be the case and along with Kohli\u2019s typically assured 82 India posted the highest ever total against an Australian side at a World Cup. Australia\u2019s attack was ill-suited to a confusing Oval pitch. There was a hint of menace with the new ball but little bounce and no sideways movement. How much assistance it offered spin was hard to tell with Adam Zampa bowling poorly and Nathan Lyon not selected. Six bowlers each bowled at least six overs as Aaron Finch chopped and changed in the hope of breakthroughs that rarely came. Australia now have a mountain to climb but in this new era of massive ODI chases it is far from insurmountable. Find out if they can make history with Adam Collins. 50th over: India 352-5 (Rahul 11, Jadav 0) Rahul slogs the final ball of the innings over cow corner for four. Phew! What a finish. India end with a record breaking 352. After Stoinis struck with that superb wicket he gifted KL Rahul a six first ball with a leg-stump full toss. A single brought Kohli on strike but the skipper, starved of the strike, lacked timing and after a hard-run two he could only squirt a drive out to the cover sweeper on the full. Marcus Stoinis has just taken one of the best caught-and-bowled\u2019s you\u2019ll ever see. To begin with he landed a decent yorker, one that Dhoni still managed to wallop, only to see the bowler stick out a big right paw and clutch the drive in his follow through. Super cricket. 49th over: India 338-3 (Kohli 80, Dhoni 27) Oh Mitchell Starc, you can\u2019t bowl in MS Dhoni\u2019s arc at this stage of the innings. From around the wicket the big quick sees his first ball launched into orbit over square leg and then his second thumped wide of fine leg for four. Just four more come from the following four deliveries but the damage has already been done. India\u2019s acceleration has been textbook. 48th over: India 325-3 (Kohli 80, Dhoni 14) Stoinis hasn\u2019t had a great day with the ball but he\u2019s entrusted at the death by Finch - and he performs solidly, keeping India to just nine runs and one boundary with a mixture of wide yorkers and slower balls. 47th over: India 316-3 (Kohli 79, Dhoni 7) Can Starc continue Cummins\u2019s excellent work? Not with Kohli on strike! What. A. Hit. Length from around the wicket and India\u2019s skipper nonchalantly lifts him into the crowd over extra cover. A single brings MS Dhoni on strike and he\u2019s the second batsman of the day to be dropped first ball - albeit in very difficult circumstances. After shelling Pandya earlier Carey this time manages to fly high to his left and get his glove-tips to an edged pull. Still, the outcome is four more to India\u2019s total. 15 from the over and India are surging. 46th over: India 301-3 (Kohli 71, Dhoni 0) Cummins finishes with 1-55 from his ten overs. They\u2019re not flashy numbers but they are superb in tough conditions. Cummins begins his final over superbly, landing a wide yorker to Kohli then deceiving Pandya with a slower bouncer. Another wide yorker is dug out by Pandya and squeezed behind point for four but the bowler has the last laugh, taking his time to reset the field, adjusting his pace and tempting the allrounder to mistiming a low full toss to Finch at mid-off. 45th over: India 293-2 (Kohli 70, Pandya 42) Finch has done well to still have Cummins and Starc up his sleeve for this phase of India\u2019s innings but Australia\u2019s best still isn\u2019t enough to rein in this partnership in this mood. Starc\u2019s latest spell begins with a 12-run over including one massive Kohli six when he times what looks like a five-iron out of the screws and over long-on. Arun is also on board with the view that India might have launched their assault a little later than they could/should have. \u201cDespite the easy track and ineffective Aussie bowling, I feel the Indians have played too conservatively to take the game beyond the opposition. The way they are going, they will only get to 340 which will be about par. Remember Kuldeep hasn\u2019t had a great time recently and India have a 5th bowler problem too. They should have taken a leaf out of England\u2019s performance yesterday which started similar but then exploded much earlier.\u201d 44th over: India 281-2 (Kohli 59, Pandya 41) Oh boy, Pandya is making me eat my words. Cummins returns to the attack and he is greeted by the allrounder bunting him for six straight back over his head then glancing him for four with the authority of a conductor flicking a baton. The Indian chorus responds with increasing decibels but that\u2019s all the boundary-hitting for this over, Cummins regaining control with a variety of angles avoiding Pandya\u2019s hitting arc. 43rd over: India 267-2 (Kohli 59, Pandya 28) Huge moment in this innings as Finch invites Zampa back to float down his leg-spin. For four deliveries it works with India swinging too hard and losing their shape. Ball five is in Pandya\u2019s slot though and it lands well over the midwicket fence. \u201cIn this day and age, any top team with a RR of only 6, and only 2 wickets down after 40 overs, is doing it wrong,\u201d emails John Hamilton. \u201cIndia seem to have settled for 4 runs / one boundary an over all the way through.\u201d That may yet prove the case. It all depends how Australia bat this afternoon. It does seem to be conservatively managed so far though, I would agree. 42nd over: India 257-2 (Kohli 57, Pandya 20) Coulter-Nile\u2019s final over is bookended by two stunning fours, the first smashed disdainfully on the up by Kohli through the covers, the second bludgeoned straight through the bowler by Pandya. In between NCN did well to vary his pace and make boundary hitting difficult. The mysterious Yum from the land of Oz has returned. \u201cIf the Aussies want to keep their chasing record since 1999, it looks like it will have to be a WC record chase as well.\u201d 41st over: India 246-2 (Kohli 51, Pandya 15) Ten overs remaining. Half of them will be bowled by the Starc-Cummins axis but what can Finch muster from the other end? He begins with Maxwell and there are oohs and ahhs as he beats Kohli\u2019s outside edge. India\u2019s skipper shrugs off the disappointment, nudging a single to bring up his fiftieth fifty in ODIs. After completing the run Pandya swaps his bat with the 12th man. The new bat then sends the ball miles into the London sky for the biggest six of the day so far. 40th over: India 236-2 (Kohli 49, Pandya 7) Another decent over for Australia. Kohli finds the boundary once but Coulter-Nile only concedes six in total. The two-paced nature of this surface is really suiting Australia\u2019s death bowling variations. 39th over: India 230-2 (Kohli 48, Pandya 2) After Dhawan and Kohli\u2019s partnership threatened to take India into the stratosphere Australia have fought back well. Sensing the initiative is there to be seized Finch returns to his best bowler, Cummins, and he\u2019s rewarded with a tight over that goes for just five. Throughout this innings the narrative has been one of India guiding their way sensibly to a big total. It might soon be worth asking whether they\u2019ve left their acceleration a little late. The run-rate remains below six and Australia will know what they have to do to prosper on this stodgy track. 38th over: India 225-2 (Kohli 44, Pandya 1) Pandya should be out first ball but Carey drops a regulation catch to his right off Coulter-Nile. Decent line and length from the bowler, the batsman fails to commit, tickles the edge but Carey can\u2019t decide whether to dive or not, ends up falling in instalments and fails to hold on. Australia\u2019s fielding has been off today from their usual high standards. As well as that drop there has been some ordinary ground fielding too. Decent over from NCN consisting mainly of slower-ball bouncers. 37th over: India 220-2 (Kohli 40) After being content to see off Mitchell Starc so far today Dhawan has just drilled a yorker past the bowler\u2019s left ear and into the sightscreen for four. Starc responds superbly with a length delivery that skims over the bails. This is an excellent duel, and it ends with honours to the Australian! Dhawan aims an almighty hoick to a length ball on off stump that spirals miles into the air and out towards the midwicket boundary where Nathan Lyon - on as a sub fielder - holds onto the kind of catch that turns club cricketers\u2019 knees to jelly. Superb knock from Dhawan. He leaves to a standing ovation after setting India up for a healthy total at the Oval. 36th over: India 213-1 (Dhawan 112, Kohli 38) The roulette wheel lands on No.6 which means Coulter-Nile\u2019s turn to bowl again but his seventh over does not provide another Australian breakthrough. India\u2019s score advances by seven, the highlight of which was a Kohli pull of ominous timing. 35th over: India 206-1 (Dhawan 112, Kohli 32) Starc returns for his third spell but his sixth over is as wicketless as his previous five. India happy just to see him off and profit from the rest of Australia\u2019s attack. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s an elegant term in behavioural psychology for logic like Dean Kinsella\u2019s: \u201cThis is an exhibition knock from Dahwan and an expos\u00e9 of Ozzie limitations in the bowling department,\u201d he emails. \u201cWon\u2019t stop Oz from skittling England in the Ashes though.\u201d 34th over: India 201-1 (Dhawan 109, Kohli 30) A quick drinks break sets us up for a 17-over dash to the line. Dhawan begins it by opening his shoulders to Maxwell, lofting him first over midwicket for four then over extra cover for another boundary. John Eden is trying to be mischievous. \u201cHave you noticed Stoinis has both his little fingers wrapped in sandpaper?\u201d. I think it\u2019s just strapping. 33rd over: India 190-1 (Dhawan 100, Kohli 28) Stoinis gets another over but it begins with Kohli slapping him for four. It was in the air in the general vicinity of Maxwell at midwicket but it wasn\u2019t a chance. A single brings Dhawan on strike and he tries to scamper the single he requires for a century but has to be sent back. He goes again next ball but this time Kohli has to dive to make his ground! And the ball ricochets off the stumps and away for an overthrow - 100 to Shikhar Dhawan! 95 deliveries, a damaged thumb, and an excellent control of tempo to counter Australia\u2019s weapons and pressurise their depth. 32nd over: India 182-1 (Dhawan 99, Kohli 22) Maxwell into his fifth over now and it goes for just four, making it hard not to speculate that Australia failing to select Nathan Lyon in the XI may have been an error on this slow worn surface. Dhawan is on 99, a ton is imminent. 31st over: India 178-1 (Dhawan 97, Kohli 20) Finch continues to throw the ball around, trying to eke out as many overs as he can from his allrounders. Stoinis wins this edition of pass the parcel but he\u2019s lucky to concede only eight with this pair now set and primed to attack. 30th over: India 170-1 (Dhawan 96, Kohli 13) Finch doubles down with Maxwell and he gets away with it again, going for six despite Dhawan pulling a rank long-hop mercilessly for four. Brian Withington\u2019s back with more on the plot of Memento II. \u201cPlease pass on my thanks to Ravi Raman for the special rasagullas generously directed at my forebodings (over 20). Sadly, I\u2019m not sure he would be sending me so much sugar if I\u2019d shared the pre-ordained result of the final. Anyone who\u2019s watched Memento should have a clue as to who comes out on top in the end/beginning (hint: Guy Pierce/Stephen Fleming has tattooed the initials \u2018VK\u2019 all over his body).\u201d 29th over: India 164-1 (Dhawan 91, Kohli 12) Cummins\u2019s opening spell was superb, tight and heavy with the odd livener thrown in, but spell number two has been below par. Kohli cut him for four last over and now Dhawan finds the boundary off his bowling, albeit off the toe of a mistimed ramp. After all the talk of Aggressive fast short-pitched bowling this match so far has been defused by an unresponsive ball and a lifeless pitch. Vic Lanser\u2019s seen enough. \u201cIndia will walk this, as it\u2019s clear the Aussies have only one-and-a-half bowlers, and India bat well to 6. So all over already.\u201d 28th over: India 157-1 (Dhawan 84, Kohli 12) Finch turns back to Maxwell to try to burgle an over or two before Kohli\u2019s completely set. And it works, ripping through an over worth just four singles. 27th over: India 153-1 (Dhawan 82, Kohli 10) Speaking of Cummins, Finch has brought his main man back into the attack to have a dart at Kohli, his bunny* during the last Australian summer. The first round goes to India though, Kohli latching onto a short and wide one to carve the first boundary of his innings. *No hate mail please, I\u2019m only joshing, but four dismissals in five matches at an average of 33 is very handy against the best batsman in the world. 26th over: India 147-1 (Dhawan 82, Kohli 5) Hmmmmm is that the smell of a commentator\u2019s curse I can smell? No sooner was I counting boundaryless overs than Dhawan reaches out to drive Zampa through the covers then lofts him disdainfully over mid-on for four more. India\u2019s opener was a little edgy after he was struck on his left thumb by Pat Cummins but his eye is certainly in now. Here\u2019s some magic from Tim de Lisle, spinning OBO gold even when he\u2019s not being paid to. 25th over: India 136-1 (Dhawan 73, Kohli 3) Four singles from the latest Coulter-Nile over, the fourth in a row without a boundary as India regroup after that unexpected wicket. 24th over: India 132-1 (Dhawan 71, Kohli 1) Oooh, one almost becomes two with Dhawan lucky to bisect longs off and on with a mistimed lofted drive to a well-flighted Zampa leggie. Zampa\u2019s into a decent rhythm now, so much so Finch gives him a slip to Kohli. The Indian genius doesn\u2019t mind and strokes a single into the covers to get off the mark. Better from Australia though, consecutive overs putting the onus back on India to respond. 23rd over: India 127-1 (Dhawan 67, Kohli 0) Would you believe it? India cruising, Australia drowning not waving, and up pops the maligned Coulter-Nile with a wicket maiden. Now, can Australia capitalise? Or is this the ideal foundation for The Kohli Show? Finch spins the rolodex and it lands on Coulter-Nile for his third spell. This one starts more promising than his previous two though, a bit of extra grunt hitting Rohit\u2019s bat hard from a length. Then he jags the breakthrough! That extra grunt pays, dropping his length back a fraction, inviting the back-foot shot but all Rohit can do is glance the ball to Carey\u2019s right and the simple catch is taken. Top bowling and out of nowhere Australia have an opening. 22nd over: India 127-0 (Rohit 57, Dhawan 67) Finch gives Zampa another whirl and India collect six more runs, but it really should have been a lot more with two long-hops going unpunished. Australia are on the ropes right now. 21st over: India 121-0 (Rohit 55, Dhawan 63) Now it\u2019s Rohit\u2019s turn to raise the bat, reaching his half-century with a whipcrack cut to a loose Starc delivery. Ten from the over in total, Starc\u2019s fifth. The walls are very slowly closing in around Aaron Finch. 20th over: India 111-0 (Rohit 46, Dhawan 62) This is getting ugly for Australia. After seeing off Starc in the previous over Dhawan feasts on Stoinis, pulling a slower-ball bouncer for four then standing his ground and driving over long-off. This will take all Aaron Finch\u2019s cunning to keep Australia competitive. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Ravi Raman. \u201cAll across India we have variations of the same theme. When someone says something very special we respond with \u201cmooh mein shakkar\u201d - sugar for your mouth. So may I offer Brian Withington some very special rasagullas for his auspicious forecast.\u201d 19th over: India 100-0 (Rohit 44, Dhawan 53) Starc returns for his second spell of the match and his extra pace forces India\u2019s openers back into their watchful early mindset. There\u2019s still nothing happening in the air or off the pitch though and Rohit and Dhawan continue on their merry way, racking up a century partnership in the process. 18th over: India 96-0 (Rohit 42, Dhawan 51) India look like they\u2019re playing Dads v Lads against Stoinis, so unperturbed are they at the crease. Dhawan coasts to his half-century during an over that could politely be described as popgun. Time for a change of tack from Australia, and right on cue, here comes Mitchell Starc... 17th over: India 90-0 (Rohit 40, Dhawan 47) First six of the day! NCN is too short and Rohit is on it in a flash, pulling hard well behind square. The energy around the Oval is shifting very much in India\u2019s favour. Aaron Finch looks a tad forlorn. \u201cHow many games do Australia win by their fielding?\u201d asks John Mackay. \u201cThey are ridiculously good.\u201d That they are, and you fancy they may need a piece of miraculous fielding to jolt them out of this torpor. After they looked comfortable containing India at around four rpo they now just look toothless as the run-rate creeps towards 5.50. 16th over: India 81-0 (Rohit 32, Dhawan 46) Finch calls on Marcus Stoinis, his sixth bowler in just the 16th over, but he might be searching for a seventh because Dhawan ramps Stoinis\u2019s first delivery effortlessly for four over the keeper\u2019s head. \u201cHi Jonathan,\u201d hi Brian Withington. \u201cAs an England supporter I\u2019m finding it rather difficult to shake the sinking feeling that we are witnessing a rehearsal for the WC final here - d\u00e9j\u00e0 pre-vu? All it would need to complete the sensation would be a few Memento style scenes of the Indian innings in black and white, interspersed with reverse chronology of the Australian reply in colour.\u201d Lovely stuff. Guy Pearce is also the spit of Stephen Fleming, so if the movie of your adaptation of a movie was made, there\u2019d be no trouble finding a live-action double. 15th over: India 75-0 (Rohit 31, Dhawan 41) Coulter-Nile back into the attack and the change almost does the trick. The big right-arm quick nails a cross seam bouncer destined for the badge on Dhawan\u2019s helmet but the batsman whips his wrists at the last minute and deflects the ball high in the direction of fine-leg and he collects four. That was not a controlled shot. This is a slowish surface but one occasionally rewarding a bowler prepared to bend his back. 14th over: India 69-0 (Rohit 30, Dhawan 36) Zampa is struggling a bit out there. Four easy singles precede a junk long-hop that is lucky to go for only two, and a powerful off drive that\u2019s drilled straight to the sweeper. Finch has a bit of thinking to do. 13th over: India 62-0 (Rohit 25, Dhawan 34) Boundaries are starting to arrive with some regularity now, Rohit with the latest, advancing to Maxwell and driving square through the offside for four. Plenty of enterprising footwork from both batsmen keep the scoreboard moving and up the intensity. India coasting at the moment and Australia don\u2019t look like they know what to do beyond try to contain. Abhijato Sensarma has a hunch. \u201cThis is the last day of my fulfilling, month-long summer vacation. Watching what has been the most anticipated match of the World Cup so far is a perfect way to round it off! Coming to the encounter itself, something tells me that Indians who play for Mumbai in the IPL and are now playing v Australia (Rohit Sharma, Hardik Pandya &amp; Jasprit Bumrah) will put in an excellent aggregate performance today! Let\u2019s see...\u201d 12th over: India 55-0 (Rohit 19, Dhawan 33) Impressed with what he saw from Maxwell, Finch opts for spin from both ends. But Zampa opens with a rank long hop that Rohit bullies through square leg for a gimme four, he then offers Dhawan just enough width to be guided to fine third-man for four more. There is little margin for error on this surface. 11th over: India 44-0 (Rohit 13, Dhawan 28) First look at spin-ish with Finch turning to Glenn Maxwell for some variety and he\u2019s rewarded with a very tidy over. There\u2019s some slow purchase off this used pitch and a nude nut beats Rohit\u2019s outside edge. The game is tantalisingly poised. India have clearly decided to build slowly but Australia will be happy at a run-rate of four after looking so unthreatening during the first powerplay. 10th over: India 41-0 (Rohit 11, Dhawan 27) Patrick Farhart was back out tending to Dhawan between overs, applying some strapping to that left thumb and supplying some painkillers. The injury looks to be affecting the left-hander who lacks timing during Coulter-Nile\u2019s second over despite showing plenty of intent. Australia will be pleased with the limited damage after that disastrous first over. It\u2019s hard to see where the breakthroughs are going to come from though with the field already in containment mode and the ball and pitch offering precious little. 9th over: India 39-0 (Rohit 10, Dhawan 26) India\u2019s intent against Coulter-Nile is not continued against Cummins, and the Australian paceman shows them why, forcing Dhawan to jig on the crease with a searing bouncer. The ball cannoned into Dhawan\u2019s left thumb and it requires a squirt of the physio\u2019s magic spray to cool. There haven\u2019t been many dangerous deliveries this morning but most, if not all, have been delivered by Cummins. He has 0-15 from his five overs. There won\u2019t be many tighter opening bursts than that. Back to the perils of playing and watching cricket, here\u2019s Andrew Benton. \u201cNo-one\u2019s considering the risks of following the OBO! I\u2019ve stubbed my toe, banged my knee, spilled hot tea in my lap and misses countless deadlines, and am always ready to rush under a doorway in case of an earthquake, and it\u2019s all down to the OBO. It\u2019s tough out here too, you know.\u201d 8th over: India 36-0 (Rohit 9, Dhawan 24) First change of the day sees Coulter-Nile replace Starc in the attack. Dhawan greets him by advancing down the pitch and slapping a length delivery in ungainly fashion to the long-on boundary. The waggon wheel will record that as an on-drive for four; it wasn\u2019t. That same graphic will accurately record the next delivery as a legside wide and the one after that a classical square cut for four. Deary me, three fours in four balls! Glorious from Dhawan, riding Coulter-Nile\u2019s bounce outside off and guiding the ball wide of third-man. An inauspicious start from Australia\u2019s first-change who didn\u2019t look happy with the pitch, his field, or any of his deliveries. India clearly targeting the perceived weaker link. 7th over: India 22-0 (Rohit 9, Dhawan 11) Cummins is giving his all out there but the conditions are doing him no favours. He musters an appeal for caught behind after ripping a bouncer through Dhawan but the attempted pull brushed the batsman\u2019s bicep, not his willow. All very so-so so far. Not the gladiatorial battle we might have expected. 6th over: India 21-0 (Rohit 9, Dhawan 10) India still happy to accumulate steadily and see off Starc and Cummins. Starc continues to look unthreatening with the white ball doing nothing in the air or off the pitch. \u201cHave you seen the ridiculous state of the official ICC highlights of every match on YouTube?\u201d asks Deepak Nandhakumar. I confess I haven\u2019t. \u201cA whole 100 overs of cricket condensed into just five minutes and change! Yesterday\u2019s highlights started at the 9th over of the England innings, with the score already at 56-0. And which idiot made the decision to not even show all the wickets? Disgraceful. And now, just as I\u2019m writing this email, the power\u2019s gone out on account of the heavy rain here in Kerala. Aaaagh. JP, please write the OBO like you\u2019re Ed Sheeran writing about a childhood love and paint a picture for me with your words.\u201d Accessing cricket remains baffling. The lack of free to air coverage in the UK has to be remedied if the game is expected to flourish. And don\u2019t get me started on the ten-team World Cup format. Why would a governing body choose to limit its potential audience? 5th over: India 19-0 (Rohit 7, Dhawan 10) Dhawan survives the first jaffa of the day and it\u2019s again from that length on the very outer margin of good from Pat Cummins. Pitching on middle it seams and bounces towards the cordon just skimming beyond the outside edge. If anything Clive, it was too good. Is Dhawan phased? No chance. He responds by stroking the first boundary of the day with the minimum of fuss through the covers. No need to move his feet, just swing the bat and get the hands through the ball. There are plenty of runs on offer for any batsman who gets his eye in today. 4th over: India 11-0 (Rohit 7, Dhawan 3) Starc looks to be nearing his rhythm, sending down a classic one-two combination to Dhawan, first the bumper then the yorker, but the Indian left-hander navigates both well. The sucker punch is a length delivery outside off that Dhawan attacks on the up and drives unconvincingly but safely into the ring. No fireworks from either side to report yet. John Starbuck has joined the conversation about the physical danger we put ourselves in when we take the field - or a net session. \u201cAnother nets danger is when you\u2019re on a large practice ground and, while your nets are taking place at one end, an actual match can be happening elsewhere. This means that over-enthusiastic net batters can disturb the match by hitting high and long, with a possibly dangerous result for fielders. I\u2019ve been ticked off for this sometimes, but curiously did not feel especially apologetic.\u201d 3rd over: India 9-0 (Rohit 6, Dhawan 2) Oohs and ahhs in the field as Cummins adjusts his length and finds some extra bounce to catch the shoulder of Dhawan\u2019s bat. The ball scoots wide of the second of two slips but offers some encouragement to the quicks that with enough back bend there may be some reward from what appears a very placid surface. There\u2019s another thick edge later in the over, Rohit this time, but from a length ball that barely climbed over shin height. 2nd over: India 7-0 (Rohit 5, Dhawan 1) Dhawan gets off the mark first ball which brings Rohit on strike to face Starc and immediately COULTER-NILE PUTS HIM DOWN at square leg. That was a heck of an effort from the big paceman, diving high to his right but he palms the effort around the post instead of holding on. It wasn\u2019t a great delivery (half-volleyish on leg stump) and it wasn\u2019t a great over, lacking swing, venom, and with a variable line and length. These already look like tough bowling conditions. 1st over: India 2-0 (Rohit 2, Dhawan 0) Cummins begins with a tidy line and length, drawing Rohit forward around off stump. The Indian opener is watchful, guiding a couple with a push through point and safely defending the other five. Not much else to report. No swing and no obvious pace or bounce in the pitch. Pat Cummins will open the bowling for Australia. Rohit Sharma on strike for India. Ian Gould and Chris Gaffaney are your umpires. Nigel Llong is watching on TV. Here we go! Anthem time at the Oval. A chance for me to ask, is this the best ever World Cup for kits? Cut, colours, design, they all seem spot on this year. Makes for a nice change. India winning the toss and batting first means of course that the drama over MS Dhoni\u2019s gloves will have to wait a few hours. The discussion about bowlers - net bowlers in particular - requiring protection has sparked some debate. We\u2019ll feed that through the OBO throughout the day. Gary\u2019s identification of T20 crowds being at risk is also a valid point to raise. Like an underground MC, I am here for the shout-outs, like this one from Jerry Sharpe. \u201cA big shout-out for my life-long friend Mr Clive Osmond who will be delivering the ICC Trophy to the field before todays match. So pleased for him and know he\u2019s proud and honoured to have been selected.\u201d Onya Clive. \u201cI saw an ominous smirk creep out the side of Virat Kohli\u2019s face as he pondered the bright sunshine and called batting a \u2018no brainer\u2019,\u201d emails the mysteriously named Yum (presumably an Australian fan). Yes, Kohli did look like the cat that found a swimming pool full of cream, but then the CricViz boffins have just informed us that Australia haven\u2019t lost a World Cup chase since 1999! Australia\u2019s return to ominous form has coincided with Mitchell Starc relocating his mojo. The star of the 2015 World Cup is one of the greatest ODI bowlers in history (currently top of the tree for average and strike-rate for bowlers with 150+ wickets) but inconsistency has plagued the left-arm quick in recent seasons. With the help of Andre Adams, Starc is on his way back to his best. India are also unchanged. That fearsome top three against Australia\u2019s rapid new ball attack promises to be thrilling. India XI: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (c), KL Rahul, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah. If it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it. Australia are unchanged, which means still no place for Nathan Lyon on a surface that looks like it could favour the GOAT. Australia XI: Aaron Finch (c), David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Steve Smith, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Alex Carey (wk), Nathan Coulter-Nile, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa. Virat Kohli is delighted to have first use of a dry Oval pitch. The Indian skipper thinks the deck will be hard and full of runs early and offer turn and variable bounce later. Aaron Finch admits he would have batted first also, concerned by how dry the pitch is and how that might affect playing conditions later. As expected, both sides have named unchanged XIs. Runs ahoy! Australia\u2019s preparations for today\u2019s game were disrupted when David Warner struck a drive that hit one of his team\u2019s net bowlers in the head. The bowler, Jaykishan Plaha, was taken to hospital as a precaution in an incident that left Warner \u201cshaken up\u201d. I\u2019m surprised (and relieved) we don\u2019t have more of these incidents in the modern game where power hitting is reaching Marvel superhero levels and bowling - especially net bowling - is little more than cannon fodder. At club level I\u2019ve flinched many a time when my Angus Fraser-lites have fizzed back towards me with interest and I\u2019ve never gone near a net with someone like Warner and his Kaboom at the other end of it. Helmets are now commonplace for umpires in limited overs matches and forearm shields are even used on occasion, but bowlers remain unprotected. The primacy of self preservation surely means it can\u2019t be too long before precautions are taken as standard, while the workplace health and safety requirements of venues may end up compelling changes whether players like them or not. I just wonder if we\u2019ve been taking something for granted because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been and there hasn\u2019t yet been the serious incident to force a rethink when a risk assessment would raise a pretty obvious red flag? That said, Luke Fletcher did miss half a season for Notts a couple of years ago after a nasty incident. What do you all think? Yesterday\u2019s action saw New Zealand and England complete the comprehensive victories expected of them. The Black Caps are the first team to three wins and remain on course for the semi-finals, while the form of Jason Roy and Jofra Archer restored the optimism of home fans following the upset defeat to Pakistan. However, the discomfort in Jos Buttler\u2019s hip that prevented one of the stars of the tournament from keeping wicket will be of some concern. Here\u2019s your track. It\u2019s a used pitch but is it dry enough to force either side to shuffle their packs? Early suggestions from the ground are that both teams will name unchanged XIs. A little diversion before we focus on the task in hand. Congratulations French Open champion Ash Barty on becoming the fifth first-class cricketer to win a tennis Grand Slam title and the first in 106 years. The 23-year old\u2019s story is really something. A junior tennis prodigy Barty gave the game up to play cricket a few years ago, competing for the Heat in the 2015-16 WBBL. Since her return to the WTA Tour she has blossomed, culminating in her incredible achievement at Roland Garros. Some good news to begin with - it\u2019s dry in London! Following the washout in Bristol earlier this week there have been some nervous glances skywards in anticipation of this blockbuster but the Oval should be dry all day. It\u2019s not going to be hot with a blustery southerly keeping temperatures in the high teens. Hello everybody and welcome to match 14 of the 2019 Cricket World Cup - and it\u2019s a corker - India versus Australia from The Oval. Both perennial contenders arrive in south London undefeated during this early phase of the tournament for what is perhaps our first glimpse yet of a head-to-head contest that may repeat in the knockout phase. Still an age away from the business end of this competition neither side will want to cede the psychological advantage. India are still feeling their way having taken their opening bow much later than their rivals and they have a score to settle with Australia having suffered three consecutive ODI defeats on home soil to the defending champions in preparation for this World Cup. Those Australian victories have proven the catalyst for a remarkable turnaround in form. A miserable record of eight wins in 33 ODIs and confusion over selection and strategy has been replaced by ten wins on the spin, accompanied by big names back in the side and bang in form. It\u2019s the Australian cricket team at a World Cup, would you expect anything less? The highlights of this tournament will be the big hits and massive scores but beneath those gaudy figures it remains the bowlers who will determine many results. Even if the numbers don\u2019t look pretty at first glance, once we acclimatise to this brave new world a semblance of order will appear. Today for example the gloriously free-scoring Oval may well host all manner of eye-watering records but the duel between Jasprit Bumrah and Mitchell Starc may well prove decisive. Both pacemen take wickets early and often and both are a slogger\u2019s nightmare at the death. Anyhow, with play to begin in about an hour (10.30am local / 7.30pm AET) there\u2019s plenty more time to consider what\u2019s ahead of us. As always, if you want to join in - and I encourage you to do so - please send me an email or a tweet at your convenience.",

England and Scotland get their World Cup campaigns under way in a mouthwatering fixture in southern France to lift the curtain on Group D. Phil Neville\u2019s side are the favourites \u2013 only two years ago they beat Scotland 6-0 in Euro 2017 \u2013 but Scotland (ranked 20 in the world) are much improved since then and England (ranked third) have been a little on the underwhelming side leading into the tournament, losing 1-0 at home against both Canada and New Zealand.</p> <p>Scotland beat Brazil, Denmark and Jamaica coming into the tournament and manager Shelley Kerr has had the added benefit of six months\u2019 full-time preparation with Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, helping those players who are part-time to be given sabbaticals from their day jobs to give them the best chance of success. They also have fewer injuries to contend with than they did at Euro 2017 and the Arsenal midfielder Kim Little is in fine form and determined to make up for the heartache of missing that tournament two years ago. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Neville has a hugely talented squad but a key absentee in Arsenal\u2019s Jordan Nobbs, who so often unlocks defences with her clever passing and driving runs from just behind the frontline. Her absence was notable in the defeat by New Zealand. Neville will have to find a way to make sure England\u2019s possession game has a bit more bite to it. He has called for his players to be bold in their passing and to take risks. As for Kerr, she has more managerial experience than Neville and is an exceptional communicator. If anyone can get a group of underdogs to bridge a 17-place gap in the rankings, it is Kerr.</p> <p><strong>Here are your handy guides on both teams:</strong></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/02/womens-world-cup-2019-team-guide-no-13-england\">Women's World Cup 2019 team guide No 13: England</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/03/womens-world-cup-2019-team-guide-no-15-scotland\">Women's World Cup 2019 team guide No 15: Scotland</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T14:44:17.658Z\">at 3.44pm BST</time></p>  </div>",

      "bodyText": "And Sophie Lawson on Scotland \u2026 I\u2019ll leave you with our reporter\u2019s take on England\u2019s World Cup win in their opening match against Scotland. Thanks for your emails. Bye. Player ratings David Wall writes: \u201cDid I watch a different game from the analysts on TV. I thought England were excellent, especially in the first half, and especially down both flanks. True they seemed to tire a bit in the second half, but I thought they were always in control even if not as dynamic as in the first half. Their finishing needs improving a bit, though credit to the Scottish \u2018keeper.\u201d England manager Phil Neville wasn\u2019t very happy with the second half: I was pleased with the result. The first game is always the most important game. We set standards and we cannot drop below the standards otherwise we get second-half performances like that. We\u2019ve got to be relentless now. We want to be here for 37 days. I\u2019m the biggest problem. The standards start with me. I think at 2-0 in this heat, we thought it was going to be easy in the second half. It\u2019s a lesson that every game in this World Cup is going to be difficult. The concern I had was that I wanted us to pass the ball and get control. We only did that with five minutes remaining. Scotland manager Shelley Kerr has this to say: England, I\u2019ve tipped to win this, so to run them so close was good. England played with intensity and put us under pressure. We showed what we were capable of in the second half. I don\u2019t want to comment [on the VAR-awarded penalty]. The officials have a tough job. I want to applaud the players for their second-half performance. We have to win one game. It doesn\u2019t have to be this one. We prepare for Japan now. Well, that was much tighter than Phil Neville would have liked. The Scotland goalkeeper Lee Alexander denied England time and again, giving her teammates the platform to get back in the game through Claire Emslie\u2019s second-half goal. Much will be made of the VAR-awarded penalty that Nikita Parris scored in the first half but it was a penalty as far as I\u2019m concerned. The result was a fair one. England could probably have played better and Neville will have much he would like his side to improve on but an opening win is an opening win. 90+4 min: Scotland have the ball on the left but as Beattie looks to play the ball into the box the referee blows the whistle. England are victorious. 90+3 min: England pop, pop, pop the ball around the chasing Scotland midfielders as they look to secure the three points by keeping Scotland off the ball. 90+2 min: Scott wastes a few seconds in the corner, using her strength to hold the ball. She finds Parris behind her, who races inside and tees up Stanway, whose right-footed shot curls just wide. 90+1 min: There\u2019ll be four minutes of stoppage time. Can Scotland find an equaliser? 90 min: Abhijato Sensarma thinks three is the magic number: \u201cThere have been three matches played in the Women\u2019s World Cup today. All have seen three goals scored in total. A penalty was scored in each match too, and three were scored in the entire day. They were more similar than one would realise!\u201d It\u2019s not over yet Abhijato, though England have a free-kick in Scotland\u2019s half and are doing all they can to run the clock down. 88 min: Scotland are having loads of possession but they can\u2019t get out of their own half. But then \u201cThump!\u201d A long ball forwards breaks the England press and Scotland probe down the right, before conceding a throw deep in the England half. 87 min: Arnot is on for Murray, who appears to have picked up a knock. \u201cThis is a cracking game,\u201d writes Paul Byatt. \u201cIn fact it\u2019s another cracking game in this World Cup. The Brazil and Jamaica goalkeepers really did dispel the myth that women cant be good shot-stoppers, they were excellent. Re the England Band. It can only be good that they are absent. Everything about them screams corporate tosh of the highest level.\u201d 85 min: England\u2019s game management has been good since they conceded. They have kept possession diligently and given Scotland little opportunity to get out of their own half. 84 min: Alexander makes a smart take from a deep cross by Greenwood. She has been superb in goal, her saves have given Scotland the platform to get back in this game. 83 min: Neville takes Mead off and brings Stanway on as he tries to bring a little zen-like calm into England\u2019s play. His side win a corner \u2026 and then another as Stanway\u2019s first touch is to knock the ball of a Scotland defender and behind. 80 min: Houghton gave the ball away sloppily in the buildup to Scotland\u2019s goal. It was a loose pass into midfield that Evans nicked away. She has caused Scotland so many problems in the past five minutes. Well, she made up for that wastefulness all right! Evans drives through the England midfield and prods a pass behind England\u2019s defence to Emslie on the right edge of the box. She just nips in ahead of McManus and Greenwood and sidefoots high into the roof of the net from eight yards. Game on! 75 min: Lisa Evans prods a shot at goal after a bright attack down the left. And then moments later, Little pulls the strings and finds Evans on the left again. She takes a a touch and lofts a ball to the back post, where Emslie is free, but she wastes a good chance to find a teammate inside her and hooks a shot over the bar with a tired waft of her left leg. 74 min: Kerr replaces Howard with Chloe Arthur. She\u2019s now withdrawn both full-backs, highlighting just how much they have had to do to counter England\u2019s bright attacks down the flanks. 72 min: Carney is on for Mead. It\u2019s Carney\u2019s 141st England appearance, making her the second-most capped England player of all time behind Fara Williams, on 170. 70 min: It\u2019s a deep corner by Greenwood that is headed back towards goal. White is alert and pounces, stretching to hook a shot past Alexander, but the Scotland goalkeeper stretches every sinew and makes a brilliantly athletic save. 69 min: Greenwood tries to shift the ball past Emslie and fire in a cross from the left, but the Scotland midfielder is alert and deflects the ball out for a corner. 68 min: \u201cA hooter goes in the crowd and makes me realise another reason to enjoy this game \u2013 the England brass band are absent, presumably refused entry for reasons of musical talent, aesthetic style, and simple good sense,\u201d writes Charles Antaki. \u201cOne of the French authorities\u2019 best decisions of the competition so far.\u201d 67 min: It\u2019s another deep one, that causes England problems. The ball is only half cleared and Corsie slams a shot at goal that is blocked bravely. This is sustained pressure by Scotland. They need to make it tell. 66 min: Weir loops an inswinger towards the backpost, where Bardsley stretches to punch clear. Another corner! 65 min: Cuthbert has done a magnificent job on her own up front. At times she has held off two England defenders as she has tried to keep possession and give her midfielders a chance to support her. Not that they have been able to assist her as much as she\u2019d like. A corner for Scotland. Their first! 64 min: Emslie tries to trick her way past Greenwood on the right wing, but the England defender forces her inside, where a left-footed cross is blocked. England clear. 62 min: Little is caught late by Mead, who stays on the floor after perhaps overstretching as she tried to nick possession off Scotland\u2019s playmaker. In fact, it looks like cramp. She may run it off. 59 min: Little is starting to grow in influence, connecting the dots for Scotland and moving her side forward with some neat touches and clever passes. She finds Evans on the right, but her attempted cross is blocked after some diligent defending by Greenwood. 57 min: Scotland get numbers forwards at last and Emslie has their first shot at goal, a tame effort from the right that goes straight at Bardsley. But from small acorns etc and so on. 55 min: Bright can\u2019t continue and is replaced by McManus. And for Scotland, Docherty, who has been tormented by Parris, is replaced by Smith. 53 min: England continue to dominate possession even while they are a player down. But then Houghton is caught in possession. Cuthbert, again, the player who nicks the ball and drives forwards. She looks up, though, and sees only one player in the box. Her cross is gathered comfortably by Bardsley. 50 min: Bright is receiving treatment after landing awkwardly on a shoulder. She\u2019s taken off temporarily. Bronze is covering at centre-back while Bright receives further assistance off the field. Can Scotland take advantage while they have an extra player? 48 min: Cuthbert is too strong for bright on the right, levering her bigger rival out of the way with great tenacity, before cutting inside but lacking support again. The ball is eventually worked backwards but England increase the pressure and bring the Scotland attack to a halt. 47 min: Docherty clatters in to Parris and is booked for her trouble. Parris might be minded to attack Docherty with even more vigour now. One more late tackle and it could be game over for the Scotland full-back. 46 min: England have the ball in the net within 30 seconds. White squares for Mead, who drills the ball home. But replays show White was a smidgin offside in the buildup. 45 min: England get us under way. Phil Neville will be content with what he has seen s far. Shelley Kerr will want her team to get more players up in support of Cuthbert. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for Matt Dony\u2019s comments, but he is obviously still drunk from Madrid,\u201d writes Simon McMahon. \u201cHow else would he write an email which juxtaposes the words \u2018Scottish\u2019 and \u2018success\u2019?\u201d Erm, Andy Robertson? England deserve a two-goal lead. Parris\u2019s penalty set them on their way and from thereonin England dominated. Parris and Bronze sprinkled a bit of stardust on their play on the right and pushed Scotland deeper into their own half. The move for White\u2019s second goal originated on the right. Scotland need to deal with that threat before they can go forwards themselves. I\u2019ll be back shortly. 45+2 min: Parris, who has been a constant menace, whips a ball in behind the Scotland defence that Corsie does well to toe away ahead of White. The corner is worked back to Walsh, who slams a shot at goal from 25 yards that flies over the bar. And that\u2019s that for the first half. . 45+1 min: Weir lofts a cross in towards Cuthbert but it\u2019s beyond her and rolls out for a goal-kick. 45 min: Mead whips an inviting ball in from the right that sails over Alexander to the back post, where Kirby tries to connect but Scotland scramble away. 43 min: Beattie is booked for scything Parris down on the right wing. That was a tackle that was 99% frustration. 41 min: Scotland have a chance to get back into the game straight away as Walsh is caught in possession. The ball is fed to Cuthbert, who drives a low shot past Bardsley in goal but also a foot wide of the far post. That was sloppy by England. Corsie fails to win a tackle with Kirby on the edge of the box and Scotland are punished, as White picks up possession, watched Alexander race from her line and bends the ball around her and into the left corner. A lovely finish and probably a fair reflection of England\u2019s dominance. 36 min: It\u2019s played short and then Alexander is fouled as Greenwood lofts in a cross towards Scott, who is adjudged to have been leaning on the Scotland goalkeeper. 35 min: Scotland roll their sleeves up and win the ball back on the left and from there they begin to build an attack. It\u2019s an attack that fizzles out when Weir rolls a sloppy pass back into midfield that England pick off. Moments later, Scotland have a corner to defend. 33 min: White has a pop at goal from 18 yards, but it\u2019s slightly scuffed and Alexander gets her body behind it. She\u2019s Scotland\u2019s busiest player by a long stretch. Meanwhile, here\u2019s Peter Oh: \u201cI\u2019m confused by these types of handballs in the area being referred to as falling under \u2018the new rules\u2019. Why is this new? Hasn\u2019t it always been the rule that the ball hitting an outstretched arm in the box is grounds for a penalty? I must have missed the memo about the new rules. Maybe I\u2019m just getting old.\u201d Aren\u2019t we all Peter? Well, there are new rules. Honestly. But I\u2019ll let you Google them. 31 min: Kirby is back on her feet and immediately in the action as she slips in Mead to her left. She drives into the box and tries to curl the ball around Alexander, but the keeper gets another important boot to the ball and diverts it away to safety. 29 min: The pace has dropped a little. Scotland need to have a sustained period of possession to get some confidence back into their play. Too often they\u2019re going long and giving the ball away. Meanwhile, Kirby has gone down and will need some treatment. 26 min: Emslie is left on the turf after some overzealous shadowing by Greenwood. Free-kick on the right. Evans whips in a lovely inswinger that has England\u2019s defenders backpedalling in the panicked style, but it\u2019s just a foot ahead of Weir. 23 min: White has the ball in the goal \u2026 but she\u2019s ruled offside! England are turning on the style here. A moment later, Parris nutmegs Docherty with a lovely bit of sidefoot trickery. 21 min: What a save from Alexander! Bronze, who has been imperious, controls expertly and takes the ball away from Docherty and then volleys a cross into the box that White absolutely thumps at goal from eight yards only for the Scottish goalkeeper to stretch out a leg, Pat Jennings-style, and divert around the post for a corner. 20 min: Parris and Bronze combine well on the right. Bronze backheels to Parris, who whips a cross in towards White but Scotland head clear. 18 min: White lays the ball off to Kirby on the edge of the area, who spies the bottom-left corner and drives a low shot this close to it. England are in the ascendancy. They\u2019re bossing possession and Scotland are struggling to get on the ball. Scotland need to stay strong here and weather the storm. 17 min: Scotland can probably stick with the same gameplan as they showed before the penalty. They looked well set to counterattack with Cuthbert at every opportunity. That tactic should suit them just fine while England have their tails up. 15 min: The strange thing about that penalty was that when the incident happened no one seemed to call for it. On reflection, it was probably a bit harsh, but in the era of VAR, these decisions are being given with increasing regularity (see Champions League final). Parris hammers the ball into Alexander\u2019s top right corner. No messing! The referee is checking for a handball in the box. Kirby whipped a cross in and Docherty\u2019s arm was outstretched. As the new rules go, it probably was a fair decision despite both players being so close. Penalty! 11 min: Corner for England! Mead whips a delicious ball in to the near post where Bright glances a header across goal but no one is following up. \u201cAs with the men\u2019s game, I am 100% behind Scotland, our Celtic brethren,\u201d writes Matt Dony. \u201cMainly because I\u2019m kind of interested to see exactly how a period of sustained Scottish success would affect McMahon.\u201d 10 min: It\u2019s been a very open game so far. More please! One thing to note is that Scotland are defending ever so slightly deeper so when they do go forwards, Cuthbert is having to hold on to the ball longer then she\u2019d like. 8 min: Parris drops her shoulder not once, but twice and shapes to shoot at the edge of the box, only to change her mind and try to set up Kirby inside her. The ball is nicked away though and Weir drills a long pass to Cuthbert, who races into the England box, throws a stepover and then has \u2026 no support. She plays a deep ball back to Weir, who hits a speculative shot that is easily blocked. 6 min: England put a very classy move together down the right, with Parris turning expertly before finding Scott, who swivels and feeds Bronze on the overlap. She clips in a ball to the back post that is nodded out for a corner with White looking alert. The corner comes to nothing, mind. That was a warning for Scotland, though. England looked slick. 4 min: There\u2019s a huge roar as Cuthbert shows tricky feet down the right flank before whipping in a cross that is cleared for a throw. Cuthbert has another go but it\u2019s defended well by England again. This is promising for Scotland. Emslie is sent racing through a moment later but the ball is played in with a little bit too much on it and it runs out for a goal-kick. 2 min: Scotland put the press on early to try to prevent England getting out of their half, so Greenwood goes long down the wing in search of Kirby, but the ball is shepherded out for a goal-kick. 1 min: Scotland get the match under way. They\u2019re wearing their traditional home blue shirts, while England are in white, as you\u2019d expect for this clash of old rivals. Scotland are shooting from right to left on my screen, England the other way. So picture that if you\u2019re not watching. Anthem time! God Save The Queen is belted out by the England team and the healthy contingent of fans who have travelled to France to support them. And then Flower of Scotland quivers through the Nice air with bagpipes accompanying its every note. I\u2019d say Scotland edged the anthems. Can they edge the match, though? We\u2019ll soon see. Rachel Corsie leads Scotland out into their first ever World Cup finals game in front of a healthy crowd at the Allianz Riviera. What a moment for her! Steph Houghton glances around the Allianz Riviera as she trots out into the warm Nice air with her England team in tow. We\u2019ll have the anthems shortly . The Scotland manager, Shelley Kerr, had this to say in the buildup to the match: On paper we\u2019ve bridged the gap with England. But now we\u2019ve got to bridge it where it counts, on the field. We\u2019ve already captivated our nation by qualifying \u2013 now we must ensure the legacy. We don\u2019t want this to be an isolated incident. Phil Neville has been talking about his decision to start Arsenal\u2019s Beth Mead and Manchester City\u2019s Keira Walsh, who are both making debuts in the World Cup: I think it\u2019s a great moment for both. What I said to them was that they\u2019ve earned the right to play in the World Cup. Beth came of age at SheBelieves and Keira, well \u2026 we build a lot our play around her now. Simon McMahon has been in touch: \u201cAfternoon Gregg. There seems to be a fair bit of optimism around the Scotland camp ahead of this match, and the World Cup campaign in general, and I for one don\u2019t like it. In fact, it\u2019s making me extremely nervous and uncomfortable. I think we\u2019ll lose 5-0 today.\u201d Scotland to win 1-0 then. Toni Duggan starts on the bench for England today. In case you missed it, she spoke really well on a range of subjects in the buildup to the tournament. You can read her interview with Suzanne Wrack here: In Group C, Brazil have beaten Jamaica 3-0 thanks to a hat-trick from Cristiane, who must already be a frontrunner for the Golden Boot. Looking at the lineups, Scotland\u2019s has been submitted as a 4-5-1 but I expect it will not quite be as defensive as that when the game gets underway. Claire Emslie and Lisa Evans will get forwards at every opportunity so it may resemble more of a 4-3-3. As for England, Jodie Taylor starts on the bench having struggled for goals in recent internationals and in come Beth Mead and Ellen White as Neville tries to find some cutting edge up front. It\u2019s pretty hot down in Nice. The temperature is still soaring at 28C, which may slow the game down a tad. Fans aren\u2019t complaining, though. \u201cI\u2019m in Nice for the game, my first live football in a while,\u201d writes Dyland Singfield. \u201cBumped into quite a few Scotland fans around the city\u2019s various boozers before the match but nothing hostile, in fact, everyone seems happy that we\u2019re all giving this competition proper support. Quite a difference between the reports coming from the men\u2019s competition in Portugal. Lot\u2019s of good vibes, very excited.\u201d Enjoy yourself Dylan. There are slate grey clouds outside the window here in Kings Cross, so not quite the same sunny vibe. England: Bardsley; Bronze, Bright, Houghton, Greenwood; Kirby, Walsh, Scott; Parris, White, Mead.

Subs: Smith, Love, Lauder, Crichton, Lynn, Ross, Arthur, Murray, Clelland, Brown, Fife, Arnot. Manager: Shelley Kerr Referee: Jana Adamkova (CZE) Hello. So, this is it then. England and Scotland get their World Cup campaigns under way in a mouthwatering fixture in southern France to lift the curtain on Group D. Phil Neville\u2019s side are the favourites \u2013 only two years ago they beat Scotland 6-0 in Euro 2017 \u2013 but Scotland (ranked 20 in the world) are much improved since then and England (ranked third) have been a little on the underwhelming side leading into the tournament, losing 1-0 at home against both Canada and New Zealand. Scotland beat Brazil, Denmark and Jamaica coming into the tournament and manager Shelley Kerr has had the added benefit of six months\u2019 full-time preparation with Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, helping those players who are part-time to be given sabbaticals from their day jobs to give them the best chance of success. They also have fewer injuries to contend with than they did at Euro 2017 and the Arsenal midfielder Kim Little is in fine form and determined to make up for the heartache of missing that tournament two years ago. Meanwhile, Neville has a hugely talented squad but a key absentee in Arsenal\u2019s Jordan Nobbs, who so often unlocks defences with her clever passing and driving runs from just behind the frontline. Her absence was notable in the defeat by New Zealand. Neville will have to find a way to make sure England\u2019s possession game has a bit more bite to it. He has called for his players to be bold in their passing and to take risks. As for Kerr, she has more managerial experience than Neville and is an exceptional communicator. If anyone can get a group of underdogs to bridge a 17-place gap in the rankings, it is Kerr. Here are your handy guides on both teams:",

      "bodyText": "The government\u2019s income tax plan will gift Australia\u2019s top income earners more than $33bn in benefits, according to a new economic analysis from the Australia Institute. The unlegislated income tax package will be one of the Morrison government\u2019s first priorities when parliament resumes next month. Scott Morrison and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, have already made it clear that the $158bn package is an all-or-nothing deal. That attitude is designed to wedge Labor and the crossbench into passing the tax cuts for higher income earners, designed to hit the budget in 2024-25, if lower and middle income earners are to receive their tax cuts in the shorter term. The government avoided putting a cost on the third tranche of its tax plan during the election, dismissing repeated questions on the matter by pointing to the short term benefits for low and middle income earners. For those who earn less than $120,000 to receive the full tax cuts promised by the government, which include a rebate of $,1080 for eligible earners, the second and third tranche aimed at lowering the tax burden for the nation\u2019s top earners also has to be passed. The Australia Institute\u2019s senior economist, Matt Grudoff, has put the cost of the third stage at $33bn over five years, for those earning $180,000, as part of a new distributional analysis, which also shows those earning more than $200,000 will receive a $26bn benefit over the same time frame. The unlegislated income tax cuts which make up the first stage of the tax plan for low and middle income earners are estimated to cost the budget $15bn over four years from the next financial year. With the national accounts showing the economy continues to slow, with growth at its lowest level since the global financial crisis, Grudoff said any tax relief packaged needed to be \u201cwell targeted if they are to maximise economic growth\u201d. \u201cLow- and middle-income taxpayers are more likely than high-income taxpayers to spend their tax cuts and stimulate the economy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe increased low and middle income tax offset in stage one (a) will cost the budget less money and proportionately benefit more people than Stage 3(a). \u201cThe stage 3(a) income tax cut is expected to cost the budget $95bn over five years. \u201cThe government will spend more on this part of the tax cut than it is expected to spend on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme over the same period.\u201d Grudoff recommended the government abandon its stage-three tax cuts, a notion it has so far refused to entertain. \u201cLegislating our personal income tax plan in full \u2013 I underscore, in full \u2013 will be the first substantive business in the new parliament,\u201d Morrison said late last week during a visit to Singapore. The government has claimed it has a mandate to pass its full suite of tax cuts, but the Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, said the opposition had not yet decided on a final position. During the election, an Australia Institute analysis found high income earners would benefit from $77bn in tax cuts, based on both the legislated and unlegislated tax package plan. While the Coalition\u2019s likely 77-seat win in the 46th parliament will give it a lower house majority, it will need the support of either Labor or members of the crossbench to pass legislation in the Senate. Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick said his party would not come to the table without assurances there would not be cuts to essential services to pay for the tax plan. The Grattan Institute released analysis during the election which outlined the government would be forced into making $40bn in spending cuts to meet its forecast surplus and tax cut promises, which the government immediately rejected. Patrick said while he supports the first two parts of the tax plan, the third, aimed at those earning more than $180,000 had caused both him, and colleague Stirling Griff to hesitate. \u201cWe have concerns that if the economy softens, then we\u2019ll end up in a situation where we have a lack of revenue to support essential services such as education, health, aged care and pensioner support,\u201d Patrick told Sky News on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s the due diligence that we\u2019re going through at this point in time.\u201d Labor is due to reach its final position before parliament meets for the first time early next month. The unlegislated tax plan explained: Stage 1(a): This increases the amount of money available through the low and middle income tax offset, increasing the maximum payment from $530 to $1080. Stage 2(a): This stage is due to come into effect in 2022-23. It increases the low income tax offset further from $645 to $70. The 19% marginal tax threshold is increased from $41,000 to $45,000. Stage 3(a): This stage decreases the 32.5% personal income tax rate to a flat tax of 30% for people earning between $40,000 and $200,000.",

      "body": "<p>MI5 has created a new category to rank terrorist suspects and is increasing the number of behavioural scientists it uses by 50% to improve the agency\u2019s chances of catching former jihadists who re-engage with planning attacks, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The moves follow a series of attacks in the UK in 2017, two of which were carried out by former \u201csubjects of interest\u201d. In those cases, active MI5 investigations were dropped only for the suspects to later kill civilians.</p> <p>The measures are part of a package of changes introduced after the atrocities. Internal reviews led to 125 recommendations to improve counter-terrorism efforts by MI5, the domestic security service, and counter-terrorism policing.</p> <p>Whitehall sources claim the measures have already led to investigations being reopened on suspects previously thought to pose a lower level of danger.</p> <p>MI5 is under pressure to show it learned lessons after the attacks. That pressure is expected to grow this week after the agency\u2019s deputy head of international counter-terrorism testifies for two days at the London Bridge inquest. Lawyers for the eight bereaved families claim \u201copportunities galore\u201d were missed to thwart the attack. The ringleader, Khuram Butt, is believed to be the first suspect under live investigation by MI5 to have carried out an attack.</p> <p>Until now, MI5 had lists of about 3,000 people under live investigation and a larger category of 20,000 who were previously under active investigation. The security services and police are currently managing an Islamist terror threat of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/24/uk-police-not-a-match-for-evolving-terrorism-threat-says-top-officer-neil-basu\">scale and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/24/uk-police-not-a-match-for-evolving-terrorism-threat-says-top-officer-neil-basu\">duration</a> greater than expected.</p> <p>In 2017, Khalid Masood in Westminster and Salman Abedi in Manchester came from the category of closed \u201csubjects of interest\u201d (SOIs), MI5\u2019s term for suspects.</p> <p>The agency is introducing new \u201ctripwires\u201d to warn its analysts that former SOIs may be posing an increasing threat. The signs include traumatic life events such as losing a job, and relationship issues. MI5 is making greater use of behavioural analysis to study the 20,000 former suspects, a number that is understood to be growing. </p> <p>A senior Whitehall source said: \u201cThere is a category [within the former SOIs] of individuals who are more likely to be engaged in terrorism than others. Former SOIs sit at different points of the spectrum in terms of risk. Within the 20,000, there is a category deemed more likely to re-engage. The new process recognises that closed SOIs are on a spectrum of risk \u2013 it is not binary.\u201d</p> <p>The Guardian understands that after the London Bridge atrocity, Theresa May demanded that the police and MI5 \u201cregain the momentum\u201d during a crisis meeting with counter-terrorism chiefs.</p> <p>The attacks led MI5 and counter-terrorism police to set up internal reviews. They were assessed by the barrister David Anderson, as were a series of new measures.</p> <p>Spotting former suspects who re-engage has been an enduring problem for counter-terrorism investigators. The Whitehall source said: \u201cBecause of the behavioural analysis we are doing, it will make us more likely to spot individuals re-engaging and those who are most likely to re-engage.

      "bodyText": "MI5 has created a new category to rank terrorist suspects and is increasing the number of behavioural scientists it uses by 50% to improve the agency\u2019s chances of catching former jihadists who re-engage with planning attacks, the Guardian has learned. The moves follow a series of attacks in the UK in 2017, two of which were carried out by former \u201csubjects of interest\u201d. In those cases, active MI5 investigations were dropped only for the suspects to later kill civilians. The measures are part of a package of changes introduced after the atrocities. Internal reviews led to 125 recommendations to improve counter-terrorism efforts by MI5, the domestic security service, and counter-terrorism policing. Whitehall sources claim the measures have already led to investigations being reopened on suspects previously thought to pose a lower level of danger. MI5 is under pressure to show it learned lessons after the attacks. That pressure is expected to grow this week after the agency\u2019s deputy head of international counter-terrorism testifies for two days at the London Bridge inquest. Lawyers for the eight bereaved families claim \u201copportunities galore\u201d were missed to thwart the attack. The ringleader, Khuram Butt, is believed to be the first suspect under live investigation by MI5 to have carried out an attack. Until now, MI5 had lists of about 3,000 people under live investigation and a larger category of 20,000 who were previously under active investigation. The security services and police are currently managing an Islamist terror threat of a scale and duration greater than expected. In 2017, Khalid Masood in Westminster and Salman Abedi in Manchester came from the category of closed \u201csubjects of interest\u201d (SOIs), MI5\u2019s term for suspects. The agency is introducing new \u201ctripwires\u201d to warn its analysts that former SOIs may be posing an increasing threat. The signs include traumatic life events such as losing a job, and relationship issues. MI5 is making greater use of behavioural analysis to study the 20,000 former suspects, a number that is understood to be growing. A senior Whitehall source said: \u201cThere is a category [within the former SOIs] of individuals who are more likely to be engaged in terrorism than others. Former SOIs sit at different points of the spectrum in terms of risk. Within the 20,000, there is a category deemed more likely to re-engage. The new process recognises that closed SOIs are on a spectrum of risk \u2013 it is not binary.\u201d The Guardian understands that after the London Bridge atrocity, Theresa May demanded that the police and MI5 \u201cregain the momentum\u201d during a crisis meeting with counter-terrorism chiefs. The attacks led MI5 and counter-terrorism police to set up internal reviews. They were assessed by the barrister David Anderson, as were a series of new measures. Spotting former suspects who re-engage has been an enduring problem for counter-terrorism investigators. The Whitehall source said: \u201cBecause of the behavioural analysis we are doing, it will make us more likely to spot individuals re-engaging and those who are most likely to re-engage. Behavioural analysis is a huge part of this. Some cases have already been reopened because of this process.\u201d Masood had been investigated in 2012. At the time of the Westminster attack his file was closed. Masood drove a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, then ran into the Palace of Westminster, where he stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death before being shot dead. The active investigation into Abedi was closed in 2014. He would go on to bomb Manchester Arena, killing 22 people. His case was on the verge of being reopened, and intelligence pointing to his danger had been received by MI5, but the threat he posed was not fully appreciated by analysts. \u201cMI5 can\u2019t justify intrusion into former SOIs where there is no evidence or intelligence of risk,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe are not able and do not have the resources to monitor them all. We are trying to improve the tripwires. We are trying to identify triggers to spot if someone is re-engaging.\u201d Only a limited section of Anderson\u2019s review was published.

      "bodyText": "Riot police have clashed with protesters in Hong Kong after hundreds of thousands of people marched through the streets in a massive demonstration against a proposed extradition law. Critics say the proposed law will allow mainland China to pursue its political opponents in the city, which has traditionally been a safe haven from the Communist party. A largely peaceful scene outside the parliament and government headquarters in the Admiralty business district changed dramatically in the early hours of Monday as police wearing riot gear moved in with batons and pepper spray on protesters who hurled bottles and metal barricades. Earlier on Sunday a sea of people, many wearing white, stretched for almost two miles as they marched from Victoria Park, in the east of Hong Kong island, to the government HQ. Thousands more struggled to board packed public transport from outer Hong Kong and Kowloon on the mainland. After seven hours of marching, organisers estimated that more than 1 million people had taken part, far outstripping a demonstration in 2003 when half that number successfully challenged government plans for tighter national security laws. A police spokesman said they estimated that 240,000 were on the march at its peak. Small groups of young protesters had planned to stay outside the government HQ until Wednesday, when the extradition bill is due to have its second reading, but police moved in on them after their permission to protest expired at midnight. Within minutes scenes of chaos unfolded as protesters fought with officers who were soon backed by riot police. An hour or so later riot police moved into clear out the remaining protesters. There was little resistance after the earlier violence, although some pockets of people remained sitting. Earlier police had closed metro stations and funnelled people through narrow thoroughfares, prompting accusations that they were deliberately attempting to reduce the scale of the protest. Anger grew and the crowd shouted for police to free up more space as the march came to a dead stop for large sections in stifling heat. Further down the road, crowds jeered at a pro-China broadcast on a large outdoor screen. The bill creates a system for case-by-case fugitive transfers between semi-autonomous Hong Kong and regions with which it does not already have agreements, including mainland China. Critics say the proposed law would legitimise abductions in the city and subject political opponents and activists to China\u2019s widely criticised judicial system. They fear that a pro-Beijing Hong Kong government would not resist requests of a political nature. Chants and placards targeted Carrie Lam, Hong Kong\u2019s chief executive, who has pushed for the amendments to be passed before July. Rocky Chang, a 59-year-old professor, told Reuters: \u201cThis is the endgame for Hong Kong. It is a matter of life or death. That\u2019s why I come. This is an evil law.\u201d A retired lawyer who gave his name only as Anthony said the government had \u201ctried to hoodwink us into agreeing much too quickly with something that has tremendous significance to Hong Kong\u201d. He said the bill posed a huge risk to the rule of law and would not provide Hong Kong\u2019s courts with the ability to provide proper oversight. \u201cAnd yet our chief executive tries to tell us there is no need to worry, the court is going to protect you,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat bullshit.\u201d Anti-Beijing anger has been fuelled by the jailing in April of organisers of pro-democracy protests in 2014 and by the reduced presence of pro-democracy legislators after six were removed from parliament in 2016 and 2017 for protesting against Beijing during their oath-taking. Since the end of British rule in 1997, Hong Kong has operated under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d principal, with a legal system seen internationally as its strongest asset. However, many feel the city\u2019s autonomy has been eroded by Beijing\u2019s growing influence. Martin Lee QC, a pro-democracy figure and former legislator who helped organise the protests, told the Guardian: \u201cIf we lose this one, Hong Kong is not Hong Kong any more, it\u2019s just another Chinese city.\u201d On Sunday evening Lee addressed thousands of people outside the government HQ. Thousands were yet to arrive, prompting speculation that the rally could turn into an Occupy-style event in the manner of protests in 2015 that went on for 89 days. Lee said the government was \u201csaying no to democracy and suppressing human rights and the rule of law\u201d, and that if it did not listen he expected further, perhaps bigger protests on 1 July. James To, a veteran Democratic party politician, told the crowd: \u201c[Lam] has to withdraw the bill and resign.

However, suspicions that the initiative for the law had come from Beijing were bolstered last month when a politburo member revealed that its targets included foreigners who had committed crimes against Chinese national security outside China. Corrupt Chinese officials and tycoons who have fled to Hong Kong are also a key concern for the mainland government, which has never had a fugitive transfer request to Hong Kong granted in the 22 years since the end of British rule. Human rights groups, legal alliances and numerous governments have expressed their concern about the bill. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said that it could damage the rule of law in Hong Kong, and a bipartisan congressional committee urged Lam\u2019s administration to listen to the concerns, saying local and foreign residents in Hong Kong had to be protected \u201cfrom a criminal justice system in mainland China that is regularly employed as a tool of repression\u201d. \u2022 The Guardian travelled to Hong Kong with the assistance of the Judith Neilson Institute.

For decades after 1945, communist tanks lined the borders of western Europe and communist parties were strong in Italy and France. The western system strove to retain popular loyalty by successfully providing the masses with better lifestyles than could communism \u2013 through the NHS, welfare benefits and reasonable wages. This was maintained at least in part by the heavy taxes on the super-rich, whose post-1980 reduction Jonathan Aldred describes.</p> <p>From 1980, Reagan and Thatcher launched a climate of credible military confrontation with Soviet communism, leading to the demise of the latter \u2013 and hence no need to moderate capitalism in order to compete with a rival system. The gloves are off, the super-rich are getting ever richer, and step by step the benign features of 1945-79 UK capitalism are being dismantled.<br><strong>Charles Patmore</strong><br><em>York</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/07/brexit-strange-death-british-conservatism\" title=\"\">How Brexit caused the strange death of British conservatism</a>\u201d (8 June) is an extraordinary headline because the conservatism of Edmund Burke and Michael Oakeshott died long ago during Thatcher\u2019s time under the influence of the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Chicago school economists, when Farage was himself a Tory. So now, while the Brexit party may \u201crail against\u201d a hated elite, their unexplained substantial funding implies reliance on an elite\u2019s money, possibly even the same elite that funds the Tory party. And while its philosophy may be \u201cslash and burn\u201d, the Tory cabinet\u2019s (many now standing for leader) cuts to health, social care, including care for disabled people, and education make them the destroyers. With such alternatives, voting Labour is the best option.<br><strong>David Murray</strong><br><em>Wallington, Surrey</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland suggests that the current Conservative party is anything but. The Conservative party lost its conservative nature in May 1979. For all the championing of Victorian values, Margaret Thatcher was a radical. Subsequently, any Conservative politician with ambitions has been required to worship at the altar of the blessed Margaret, and to fight others on the field of who can out-Thatcher the other.

This was maintained at least in part by the heavy taxes on the super-rich, whose post-1980 reduction Jonathan Aldred describes. From 1980, Reagan and Thatcher launched a climate of credible military confrontation with Soviet communism, leading to the demise of the latter \u2013 and hence no need to moderate capitalism in order to compete with a rival system. The gloves are off, the super-rich are getting ever richer, and step by step the benign features of 1945-79 UK capitalism are being dismantled. Charles Patmore York \u2022 Jonathan Freedland\u2019s \u201cHow Brexit caused the strange death of British conservatism\u201d (8 June) is an extraordinary headline because the conservatism of Edmund Burke and Michael Oakeshott died long ago during Thatcher\u2019s time under the influence of the Institute of Economic Affairs and the Chicago school economists, when Farage was himself a Tory. So now, while the Brexit party may \u201crail against\u201d a hated elite, their unexplained substantial funding implies reliance on an elite\u2019s money, possibly even the same elite that funds the Tory party. And while its philosophy may be \u201cslash and burn\u201d, the Tory cabinet\u2019s (many now standing for leader) cuts to health, social care, including care for disabled people, and education make them the destroyers. With such alternatives, voting Labour is the best option. David Murray Wallington, Surrey \u2022 Jonathan Freedland suggests that the current Conservative party is anything but. The Conservative party lost its conservative nature in May 1979. For all the championing of Victorian values, Margaret Thatcher was a radical. Subsequently, any Conservative politician with ambitions has been required to worship at the altar of the blessed Margaret, and to fight others on the field of who can out-Thatcher the other. In the current Conservative and Unionist party (for how much longer?) she would be dismissed for being far too leftwing.

When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign to be Britain\u2019s next prime minister is being organised ruthlessly to limit his media appearances and minimise the potential for gaffes while trying to lovebomb wavering MPs, according to his colleagues. Conservative MPs say they are \u201cgobsmacked\u201d by the lengths to which the Johnson camp has been going in an effort to win their support in recent weeks. The professionalism of his campaign \u2013 a far cry from his shambolic effort in the aftermath of the EU referendum in 2016 \u2013 has won him support from unexpected corners, uniting hard Brexiters such as Owen Paterson and Jacob Rees-Mogg with moderates such as the young rising star Johnny Mercer and Damian Collins, who has previously suggested he could support a second EU referendum. Allies say Johnson is running his campaign from a \u00a33m townhouse on Lord North Street in Westminster from which Iain Duncan Smith masterminded his leadership victory in 2001 and Michael Portillo made a failed tilt at the top job in 1995. Johnson will launch his campaign formally within days, but for weeks his team have been filling his diary with up to 16 phone calls and one-to-one meetings with MPs each day. Johnson\u2019s team, led by the former MP James Wharton, have been briefing him about each individual MP\u2019s concerns. Crucially, they say he is staying on-message and eschewing his usual tendency to resort to crowd-pleasing gags and anecdotes. MPs close to Johnson say Lynton Crosby, the Australian election guru who helped him to two mayoral victories, is not officially on board the campaign but speaks to Johnson daily on the phone and is a very close friend. Despite the denials that Crosby is part of the team formally, Johnson\u2019s performance so far does bear some of the hallmarks of Crosby\u2019s previous campaigns, in which his candidates have sought to avoid the cross-examination of television interviews. His appearances in the media have been strictly limited to just one interview with Tim Shipman of the Sunday Times, and no daily appearances on broadcast programmes like many of his rivals. Johnson is yet to confirm whether he will appear in a series of television debates being organised by the broadcasters. Journalists say Wharton hauled the clubbable Johnson away from chatting to them last week in Portcullis House and gave orders to speak to his chief media adviser, Lee Cain, if they wanted to ask him anything. Instead, the strategy has been to relentlessly target Tory MPs whose votes Johnson needs in order to reach the final shortlist to go before Tory members, making sure his policy advisers follow up on their various concerns ranging from HS2 to schools funding. One MP involved in the campaign said Johnson was impressing on MPs that he would bring serious organisational brains on board if he reaches Downing Street, including his former mayoral deputy Sir Edward Lister, who would be \u201cvery much be part of the team\u201d. He said there were daily meetings of Johnson\u2019s inner circle and a deliberate strategy to keep his media appearances to a minimum at least until he is through the MP rounds. \u201cI am not part of the inner core but I have been absolutely blown away by the organisation that I have witnessed. There are specifically designed work streams and spreadsheets. It is a serious operation. I would say he has definitely learned from last time. Boris is being managed very well,\u201d the MP said. Over the weekend, Johnson picked up backing from several serious Eurosceptics, and he ultimately expects to gain the support of the majority of MPs currently behind Dominic Raab, whose hardline Brexit stance has made Johnson\u2019s position appear more moderate. To win over centrist MPs, Johnson has also been playing up his One Nation liberal credentials, despite a bulging archive of controversialist Daily Telegraph and Spectator columns. Rees-Mogg, an ardent Brexiter and the chair of the European Research Group who is supporting Johnson and has hosted a string of dinners for MPs on his behalf, has barely surfaced in the media to support him, leaving fresher faces such as Mercer as spokespeople. A string of MPs told the Guardian they had decided reluctantly to back Johnson on the grounds that he seemed electable and had improved since 2016, when he decided to play cricket with Earl Spencer the weekend after the referendum rather than plot his leadership bid. Setting aside concerns about his stint in the Foreign Office, where some colleagues felt he mishandled the case of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and made a series of diplomatic blunders, they believe he has made a decision to become more serious this time. Simon Hart, who led the Brexit Delivery Group of MPs loyal to Theresa May\u2019s deal, said he had come to the conclusion that Johnson should be the next prime minister because the country needed \u201ca bolder choice, not without its risks, but the sort of choice which really engages people in the debate about the country\u2026 [in a way that is] eye-catching, visible and audible\u201d. He added: \u201cI see myself as an example of somebody who has been in a pretty different place from Boris during the whole Brexit process but who fully accepts that we must now move to a conclusion. We have seen in the local and Euro elections there is frustration and anger and I think that needs to be met with something colourful and persuasive. Occasionally it will be edgy and controversial but if we don\u2019t do that we will be saying some very worthy stuff but we will look lame and tired when we face [Jeremy] Corbyn at the next election and it will all have been a pointless effort.\u201d Another MP backing Johnson said they had reservations but had been convinced that he had a campaign team who could compensate for some of his personal weaknesses: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it quite up close and it is a pretty slick operation. It is methodical, it\u2019s professionalised, it\u2019s respectful.\u201d He added: \u201cI have been gobsmacked by it really. It is not the Boris we are used to. He must really want it.\u201d Gavin Williamson, the former chief whip, is key to getting wavering MPs onboard, telling them the wind is blowing in Johnson\u2019s direction much as he did for May in the 2016 contest. Williamson is also valued for his links to the DUP, whose support will be essential for Johnson to command a majority in the House of Commons. At the same time, Grant Shapps, the former Tory party chair, has been helping Johnson with number-crunching as he seeks to win over Conservative MPs. James Duddridge, a Tory MP, said he was backing Johnson because of his clear Brexit policies but also because he was \u201celectorally attractive and with a track record of turning the volume up and getting out there\u201d. He also said it was necessary to have a \u201cMarmite politician\u201d at a time when he would be up against fellow populists Corbyn and Nigel Farage. \u201cI think Boris has the wow factor \u2026 He just ticks so many boxes. It\u2019s about having a politician with a pulse, who you can believe in,\u201d he said. However, not everybody is onboard, with some disappointed at colleagues who they feel are flocking to Johnson in the hope of a job or because they believe he can save their marginal seats from a Brexit party or Labour threat. One of Johnson\u2019s leadership candidate rivals, who sat in cabinet at the same time, believes he is in fact \u201cbloody dangerous\u201d and is furious at the way some Conservatives are overlooking his flaws. They point out his chequered record in the Foreign Office and describe how he often gave the impression of being \u201cembarrassingly underprepared\u201d in cabinet. Another leadership candidate described those colleagues who were falling in behind the frontrunner as delusional about his electability, warning that the party was \u201cabout to make the same mistake again that they did with Theresa of picking someone untested by proper scrutiny during a contest\u201d. There is also the issue of whether Johnson could win everyday votes in the Commons without a general election, given his divisiveness on Brexit and the slim working majority of five that he would inherit from May. A straightforward confidence vote would be likely to arise if Johnson decided to pursue the momentous step of taking the UK out of the EU without a deal at the end of October. On the issue of whether Johnson would be able to face down those determined to stop that outcome, his backers were largely unworried.

      "body": "<p>A private health firm has lost one of the biggest and longest-running contracts to treat NHS patients, in a significant blow to the creeping privatisation of care.</p> <p>Circle is losing the contract it has held for 11 years to run the Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, which provides 240,000 operations and checkups a year. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust (NUH) has been handed a \u00a3320m contract to run the centre for the next five years after a bitter legal battle between Circle and the NHS.</p> <p>Circle has run the centre since it opened in 2008 as one of the independent treatment centres (ISTCs) that the last Labour government set up to reduce the number of NHS patients waiting for non-urgent treatment.</p> <p>Labour was accused of privatising part of the NHS because Circle was among a number of private companies that were put in charge of ISTCs and allowed to make a profit from them. Other firms, notably Care UK and Ramsay Health Care, still run centres elsewhere in England.</p> <p>Rushcliffe NHS clinical commissioning group, the NHS body that awarded the contract on behalf of a group of CCGs, decided to give it to NUH despite legal threats by Circle. It said bringing the service into the NHS would \u201csignificantly benefit patients\u201d.</p> <p>However, there are concerns that thousands of people who are waiting to be seen at the Nottingham centre, including cancer patients, will face delays once NUH takes over the contract on 29 July because it will not be in a position to provide the full range of services immediately.</p> <p>The transition was originally intended to take seven months, but is now being compressed into eight weeks amid acrimony, claims and counter-claims and legal action by Circle against Rushcliffe.</p> <p>In a court hearing in April to decide who got the contract, the CCG\u2019s chief officer, Amanda Sullivan, made clear that it preferred a \u201chiatus\u201d of at least a month affecting the services that the centre offered after NUH took control to the option of extending Circle\u2019s contract.</p> <p>In 2012 Circle became the first profit-driven health firm to be put in charge of an NHS hospital when it took over the running of Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire. It handed the contract back to the NHS in 2015 after the hospital experienced financial problems and could not keep up with rising demand.

      "bodyText": "A private health firm has lost one of the biggest and longest-running contracts to treat NHS patients, in a significant blow to the creeping privatisation of care. Circle is losing the contract it has held for 11 years to run the Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, which provides 240,000 operations and checkups a year. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust (NUH) has been handed a \u00a3320m contract to run the centre for the next five years after a bitter legal battle between Circle and the NHS. Circle has run the centre since it opened in 2008 as one of the independent treatment centres (ISTCs) that the last Labour government set up to reduce the number of NHS patients waiting for non-urgent treatment. Labour was accused of privatising part of the NHS because Circle was among a number of private companies that were put in charge of ISTCs and allowed to make a profit from them. Other firms, notably Care UK and Ramsay Health Care, still run centres elsewhere in England. Rushcliffe NHS clinical commissioning group, the NHS body that awarded the contract on behalf of a group of CCGs, decided to give it to NUH despite legal threats by Circle. It said bringing the service into the NHS would \u201csignificantly benefit patients\u201d. However, there are concerns that thousands of people who are waiting to be seen at the Nottingham centre, including cancer patients, will face delays once NUH takes over the contract on 29 July because it will not be in a position to provide the full range of services immediately. The transition was originally intended to take seven months, but is now being compressed into eight weeks amid acrimony, claims and counter-claims and legal action by Circle against Rushcliffe. In a court hearing in April to decide who got the contract, the CCG\u2019s chief officer, Amanda Sullivan, made clear that it preferred a \u201chiatus\u201d of at least a month affecting the services that the centre offered after NUH took control to the option of extending Circle\u2019s contract. In 2012 Circle became the first profit-driven health firm to be put in charge of an NHS hospital when it took over the running of Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridgeshire. It handed the contract back to the NHS in 2015 after the hospital experienced financial problems and could not keep up with rising demand. The Care Quality Commission rated the hospital\u2019s care as inadequate. Circle has lost the Nottingham contract despite the CQC rating services there as good. It had high patient satisfaction rates and, unlike many NHS hospitals, was hitting the target of treating 92% of patients waiting for planned care within 18 weeks. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said he was pleased Circle had lost the contract and criticised the firm for using solicitors to try to thwart the contract decision, which was first reported by the Health Service Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely welcome this service is returning to our public NHS and out of the hands of Circle. Patients well remember Circle\u2019s chaotic handling of the Hitchingbrooke hospital contract and their failures over dermatology at Queen\u2019s Medical Centre [in Nottingham]. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking Circle fought this move tooth and nail in the courts, exposing everything that\u2019s wrong with the expensive, wasteful process of competitive tendering and privatisation.\u201d Circle has argued that financial problems at NUH, which overspent its budget by \u00a331.8m in 2018/19, meant the trust should not be allowed to run the centre, whose services include cancer care, gynaecology, orthopaedics and pain management.

A tense, punishing rally ensues. It\u2019s hard to tell which way it will go \u2013 until Thiem takes control with another brutal forehand into the left corner. Nadal hooks it back but Thiem\u2019s waiting to break with a smash!</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62ae66beaf9e555da45812de1eb7b9ac9d602f8a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62ae66beaf9e555da45812de1eb7b9ac9d602f8a/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal digs out a shot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spain\u2019s Rafael Nadal digs out a shot.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T13:45:36.029Z\">at 2.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5cfd0a848f08ff012e271203\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T13:34:00.205Z\">2.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>First set: Nadal 2-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): </strong>Thiem skips into a 40-15 lead easily enough.

If you\u2019re busy then feel free to return in a couple of hours for the trophy ceremony. </p> \n  <p>Ok, it\u2019s not the greatest of sells to a French Open, I\u2019ll give you that. In fact I can hear people from our marketing department charging towards my desk right now. But come on, you have to admit it\u2019s hard not to think this is how it\u2019s going to play out. Thiem is a cracking player, especially on clay. A week after having to make way for Serena Williams in the main press conference room, the Austrian demonstrated his prowess on this surface by reaching his second successive final with an epic win over Novak Djokovic. It was an epic performance from the world No4, who has a justifiable claim to being the second best player around in this surface, and the second time he has sent Djokovic on his way in Paris in the last three years. Hats off to the Austrian; nobody can argue he would not be a worthy champion if he manages to pull off the unthinkable here. </p> \n  <p>There\u2019s the crux, though: in order to end his wait for his first grand slam, Thiem has to pull off the unthinkable - beat Nadal in the king of clay\u2019s Parisian palace, Court Philippe-Chatrier. It\u2019s no good being the second best player around on clay in this era - at least not as long as Nadal is around - and Thiem\u2019s task is hardly made easier by having to face the great Spaniard without the benefit of a day\u2019s rest. While Nadal cruised to a comfortable win over Roger Federer on Friday, rain delays meant Thiem\u2019s semi-final against Djokovic took two days and five sets to settle. If he isn\u2019t knackered after that, Marvel will have to make a film about him. </p> \n  <p>Short of a superhuman effort from Thiem, then, get ready for Nadal to seal a victory that would see him move on to 18 majors, three ahead of Djokovic and two behind Federer\u2019s record of 20. Sure, Thiem has beaten the world No2 four times on clay. But he lost in straight sets to Nadal in last year\u2019s final, plus in the semi-finals two years ago. Ultimately Nadal, the 11-time champion, will be happy it\u2019s Thiem on the other side of the net instead of Djokovic. </p> \n  <p><strong>Play begins at 2pm BST and 3pm in Paris.</strong> </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, see how Ashleigh Barty<strong> </strong>crowned her comeback to tennis with a French Open final triumph below.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"05eeee7c-330c-459f-b22b-e0e73df77a12\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7OZvOa8hwRo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T11:52:28.289Z\">at 12.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div>",

      "bodyText": "Post game reactions from both Nadal and Thiem Rafael Nadal collects the trophy from Rod Laver. He\u2019s used to all this now. It\u2019s the 12th time he\u2019s been up on that stage and as he listens to the Spanish national anthem blaring round Court Philippe-Chatrier, perhaps he\u2019s contemplating just how he\u2019s planning to chase down Roger Federer\u2019s record of 20 grand slam titles. He\u2019s only two behind now and will head to Wimbledon determined to make more history. That\u2019s all from me now. The 2019 French Open is over. Thanks for all your company over the last two weeks. Next stop: SW19. See you then. It goes down as a great tournament for Dominic Thiem. There\u2019s no shame in going down to Rafael Nadal here \u2013 and who knows, perhaps Thiem would have managed to prolong the contest if he hadn\u2019t been playing for the fourth day in a row. The schedule really didn\u2019t help him out. But beating Novak Djokovic was one hell of an achievement. If he can find a way of avoiding Nadal you feel he\u2019s bound to win this tournament one day. Rafael Nadal speaks! \u201cThe first thing I want to say is congrats to Dominic. I feel sorry because he deserves it here too and I hope he wins here in the future. He is a very hard worker. I want to wish him all the best for the future. It is incredible. I can\u2019t explain what I have achieved and how I feel. It was a dream to play here for the first time in 2005. I never thought in 2019 I\u2019d still be here. It\u2019s an incredible moment and very special for me.\u201d Here\u2019s a quick match report. We\u2019ll have more from our man in Paris, Kevin Mitchell, later. Victory means Rafael Nadal stands out as the most dominant singles player at any grand slam event. He\u2019s broken Margaret Court\u2019s 11 Australian Open titles. More importantly he\u2019s two behind Roger Federer\u2019s overall haul of 20 majors. Would you bet against him chasing down the Swiss veteran now? Serving for the championship, Nadal begins with an ace for 15-0. Then Thiem sends a backhand return wide, making it 30-0. At 30-15 Thiem hooks a backhand wide, handing Nadal two championship points. Nadal spurns the first, knocking a backhand long. No matter. He takes the second when Thiem sends a forehand return just wide. Nadal sinks to the dirt, covering his back in red clay, and pretends he can\u2019t believe he\u2019s won his 12th French Open title. He sobs for a moment. Who\u2019s he kidding? Fourth set: Nadal 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 5-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): The game goes to deuce and Thiem\u2019s frustration rises. Soon Nadal has a break point. Somehow Thiem saves it, stretching low to meet a volley that clips the top of the net and lands dead on Nadal\u2019s side. Yet Nadal earns another chance when Thiem nets a slice and he breaks when the Austrian spanks a forehand wide. Nadal will serve for a 12th French Open title. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 4-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal holds comfortably. Fourth set: Nadal 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 3-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem flaps a tired forehand into the net to make it 0-40. The energy has been sucked out the arena. Nadal is utterly rampant. Brilliantly, though, Thiem scrubs out all three break points. You have to admire his character. Somehow he holds, earning deserved acclaim from the crowd. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 3-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem is still fighting hard, a forehand winner making it 30-all, spraying a backhand past Nadal for a break point. Yet a sliced return fails to clear the net. Deuce. Thiem keeps pressing with his forehand and earns another chance. Nadal saves it with a good serve. He holds. Fourth set: Nadal 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 2-0 Thiem* (*denotes server): It\u2019s not looking good for Thiem when he falls into a 0-30 deficit. He raises his spirits with an 87mph forehand for 15-30. Yet Nadal earns two break points and Thiem sends a forehand wide. Fourth set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 1-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem has to start this set better than he did in the third, when he looked completely out of juice after the effort it required to level the match. Perhaps it\u2019s a good thing that set flew by so quickly. At least he hasn\u2019t wasted any energy on it. Yet Nadal looks utterly furious with Thiem for winning the impertinence of winning that second set. He quickly stomps into a 30-0 lead here. But hang on. Thiem, still defiant, somehow fights back to win the next three points and earn a break point. Nadal responds by bashing a forehand down the into the open court for deuce. He crunches to a hold, quashing the Thiem resistance. The first two points are shared. But Thiem has looked drained ever since winning the second set. At 30-all Nadal pummels a forehand past him for a set point, which he duly converts with more irresistible tennis. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-7, 5-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal is good on clay. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 5-7, 4-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem finally gets on the board, holding to love, but this set is surely done. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-7, 4-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem gives Nadal a thumbs up after a ridiculous volley from the Spaniard. The ball bounced back towards the net after landing on Thiem\u2019s side. Nadal holds to love. Thiem\u2019s won one point in this set. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 5-7, 3-0 Thiem* (*denotes server): Nadal starts the game by reading a Thiem drop shot and spitting a slice down the line for 0-15. Then Thiem nets a forehand for 0-30. This is mildly concerning. Thiem smacks another forehand into the net and Nadal has three break points. He can\u2019t take the first, but he does take the second, reading a Thiem forehand and slapping one of his own down the line to seal the double break. Third set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-7, 2-0 Thiem (*denotes server): Looking to consolidate the break, Nadal skips into a 40-0 lead. He holds with a cracking volley. Thiem hasn\u2019t won a point in this set yet. Third set: Nadal 6-3, 5-7, 1-0 Thiem* (*denotes server): Nadal is back after a quick comfort break, allowing Thiem to get the third set of this increasingly fascinating fight underway. Worryingly for the Austrian, Nadal has that look in his eye. He\u2019s all over Thiem here, drawing poor errors, quickly carving out three set points. Nadal only needs one, Thiem knocking a forehand long. \u201cIt\u2019s a measure of Nadal\u2019s dominance of this event that when he drops just one set in a final, it\u2019s gobsmacking,\u201d Gregory Phillips says. Serving to stay in the set again, Nadal finds himself under pressure at 15-all. Moments later he sends a forehand long to make it 15-30, leaving Thiem two points from levelling the match. The tension builds, rising to an unbearable intensity when Nadal loops a forehand wide, gifting Thiem two set points. Presented with a wonderful opportunity, Thiem stands up to Nadal and forces the Spaniard to send a backhand long! It\u2019s the first time he\u2019s taken a set off Nadal at Roland Garros. What an effort from Thiem. Let\u2019s face it, we were all waiting for the moment when Nadal took a two-set lead, but now we have a proper contest on our hands. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 5-6 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem continues to serve with exceptional accuracy, an ace making it 40-0. He holds to love. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 5-5 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem\u2019s furious with himself after netting a forehand on the first point. Then Nadal serve-volleys for 30-0. He\u2019s comfortable. He holds to love with a crisp forehand. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 4-5 Thiem* (*denotes server): A beautiful whipped backhand from Thiem makes it 15-0. At 30-0 he draws Nadal in with a drop shot; Nadal nets an odd backhand to make it 40-0. He holds to love and Nadal will serve to keep the set alive. I\u2019ll level with you, I didn\u2019t see Thiem managing to survive this long. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 4-4 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal nets a forehand to make it 0-15. He needs to be careful here. Unsurprisingly he wins the next three points. Thiem knocks a forehand long and Nadal holds to love. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 3-4 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem, who hasn\u2019t had a rest since Wednesday because of all the rain delays, crushes a forehand into the left corner for 15-0. It\u2019s amazing he hasn\u2019t completely wilted already. Another comfortable hold keeps him ticking over. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 3-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal motors into a 30-0 lead. There\u2019s quite a drab atmosphere on Philippe-Chatrier now, as though the crowd are waiting for Nadal to break. They\u2019re just here for the trophy ceremony. We all are. Nadal holds to love. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 2-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): The first two points are shared. Thiem is still serving strongly. He wins the next two points easily enough and holds to 15. We\u2019re in what we\u2019ll call a lull at the moment. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 2-2 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 1-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem\u2019s starting to blow hard, but he holds to 30 with a big forehand winner. He clenches his fist - and perhaps he silently gives thanks to Nadal for butchering a gimme of an overhead at 0-15. Second set: Nadal* 6-3, 1-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal holds to love. It\u2019s going to be like this until the end. Good first set, though. Second set: Nadal 6-3, 0-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem is playing at a level that would beat 99.9% of opponents today. Unfortunately it\u2019s Nadal on the other side of the net. So, y\u2019know. Still, he starts the second set with a comfortable hold, polishing it off to love. Serving for the set, Nadal loses the first point with a shoddy shot. He wins the next two, though, and soon has two set points. Thiem sends a backhand wide and that should be that. Thiem\u2019s coach is slumped over the hoardings in the stands. He looks devastated. He knows. Nadal has never lost at the French Open after winning the first set. First set: Nadal 5-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem\u2019s level drops a little and he loops a backhand long. Nadal senses an opening and at 15-30 he earns two break points with a stupendous backhand drop shot. Thiem cracks. He spanks a drive forehand volley straight at Nadal, who forces an errant volley with a powerful backhand. Nadal will serve for the set. First set: Nadal* 4-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Thiem shrugs off the disappointment of the previous game and gets straight back down to business, lashing a forehand down the line for 0-15. Then Nadal misses a forehand for 15-30. He\u2019s missing a few, which isn\u2019t like him. At 30-all Nadal knocks a backhand wide. It\u2019s another break point for Thiem, but he nets a backhand return. This game is far from done, though. Just when Nadal reckons he\u2019s going to hold, Thiem surprises him with a feathery drop shot. Then Thiem lobs him. Nadal sprints back and swipes at fresh air like a clown. It\u2019s a moment to make us all feel better about ourselves - look, he\u2019s human! Yet Thiem can\u2019t take advantage. He admonishes himself after missing a forehand down the line by a whisker. That was so close. It would have been a winner. Eventually Nadal holds with a backhand down the line. We\u2019ve been going for 44 minutes. Whoever loses this first set (Thiem) will be hurting a lot. First set: Nadal 3-3 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem has to hold here. He has to consolidate the break. But Nadal\u2019s on the offensive straight away, taking control of the first rally. Thiem makes it work for it with more incredible defence way behind the baseline, but Nadal makes it 0-15 with a smash. These are brutal rallies \u2013 and Nadal is asking for more time between the points. He isn\u2019t happy with the umpire for rushing them. But he\u2019s more content after watching a couple of Thiem forehands sail well off target. Three break points. Everyone settles down as a sense of normality returns. Thiem saves the first break point with a pinpoint forehand, but Nadal converts the second with a forehand winner from left to right. That didn\u2019t last long. First set: Nadal* 2-3 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal has made quite a few unforced errors. Thiem is defending pretty well. The question is whether the Austrian will still be running as hard in an hour or two. For now, however, he\u2019s competing and his stubborn defence helps him get back to 30-all from 30-0, Nadal missing a couple of forehands. Then he earns the first break point of the final with an enormous forehand (only after failing to kill the rally with a few volleys that were somehow repelled by Nadal). A tense, punishing rally ensues. It\u2019s hard to tell which way it will go \u2013 until Thiem takes control with another brutal forehand into the left corner. Nadal hooks it back but Thiem\u2019s waiting to break with a smash! First set: Nadal 2-2 Thiem* (*denotes server): Thiem skips into a 40-15 lead easily enough. He\u2019s defending well - and he helps himself to another hold when Nadal misses an easy forehand. First set: Nadal* 2-1 Thiem (*denotes server): Nadal sends a razor sharp forehand down the line for 15-0. Soon it\u2019s 40-0. But Thiem isn\u2019t done yet. He gets it back to 40-15 and then he makes it 40-30 with a vicious, snorting backhand that\u2019s too hot for Nadal to handle. Thiem\u2019s in this now and he clambers to deuce after another fine rally. Nadal\u2019s under a little bit of pressure, but he holds with an ace. This has been a good start from both players and I\u2019m very excited to see how Nadal breaks at 5-4. First set: Nadal 1-1 Thiem* (*denotes server): The good news is it isn\u2019t as blustery as it has been over the last couple of days. It\u2019s stiller for this one. It should help Thiem a bit. After losing the first point here, he pummels his way to 30-15. Then he dries a spinning backhand drop shot, a ploy that worked well against Djokovic. But Nadal is there. He dabs it back over the net and then he\u2019s in position to meet a Thiem backhand with a gorgeous volley for 30-all. Yet Thiem doesn\u2019t look too edgy or fatigued. He capitalises on a couple of Nadal errors to hold to 30. First set: Nadal* 1-0 Thiem (*denotes server): With the sun shining on Roland Garros, Rafael Nadal begins the 2019 men\u2019s singles final. He\u2019s in a luminous yellow t-shirt. Thiem\u2019s in bright blue. Fashion chat out the way, let\u2019s talk tennis. Nadal opens with a venomous forehand for 15-0. It feels like a sign of things to come, but Thiem hits back on the next point. Before the next point, however, we\u2019re delayed by a screaming child in the crowd. Awkward. Most people chuckle and applaud as father and child make a sheepish exit, but Nadal just frowns. We resume and the game moves to 30-all. A tense rally follows and it ends with Thiem flashing a backhand wide. Nadal holds. Tok! Tok! Tok! They\u2019re knocking up. The players have arrived on court. They\u2019re both likely to be feeling a few nerves, but Rafael Nada\u2019s will be nothing compared to Dominic Thiem\u2019s. It\u2019s been said before but it is remarkable that Dominic Thiem is the only active male player under the age 0f 28 to have reached a grand slam singles final. The other young guns need to pull their finger out, even if this is the toughest era in the history of the men\u2019s game. For now there\u2019s little sign of anyone challenging the dominance of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, a power trio still going strong in their 30s. We really could do with your Tsitsipases and Zverevs and Thiems and Tiafoes and Auger-Aliassimes to step up. Rafael Nadal leads 8-4 in the head-to-head with Dominic Thiem. Thiem has four wins over Nadal on clay, but he\u2019s lost to him four times at grand slams - three times at Roland Garros and once at the US Open. Pre-match reading Hello and welcome to live coverage of Rafael Nadal\u2019s 6-4, 6-2, 6-3 win over Dominic Thiem at Roland Garros. If you\u2019re busy then feel free to return in a couple of hours for the trophy ceremony. Ok, it\u2019s not the greatest of sells to a French Open, I\u2019ll give you that. In fact I can hear people from our marketing department charging towards my desk right now. But come on, you have to admit it\u2019s hard not to think this is how it\u2019s going to play out. Thiem is a cracking player, especially on clay. A week after having to make way for Serena Williams in the main press conference room, the Austrian demonstrated his prowess on this surface by reaching his second successive final with an epic win over Novak Djokovic. It was an epic performance from the world No4, who has a justifiable claim to being the second best player around in this surface, and the second time he has sent Djokovic on his way in Paris in the last three years. Hats off to the Austrian; nobody can argue he would not be a worthy champion if he manages to pull off the unthinkable here. There\u2019s the crux, though: in order to end his wait for his first grand slam, Thiem has to pull off the unthinkable - beat Nadal in the king of clay\u2019s Parisian palace, Court Philippe-Chatrier. It\u2019s no good being the second best player around on clay in this era - at least not as long as Nadal is around - and Thiem\u2019s task is hardly made easier by having to face the great Spaniard without the benefit of a day\u2019s rest. While Nadal cruised to a comfortable win over Roger Federer on Friday, rain delays meant Thiem\u2019s semi-final against Djokovic took two days and five sets to settle. If he isn\u2019t knackered after that, Marvel will have to make a film about him. Short of a superhuman effort from Thiem, then, get ready for Nadal to seal a victory that would see him move on to 18 majors, three ahead of Djokovic and two behind Federer\u2019s record of 20. Sure, Thiem has beaten the world No2 four times on clay. But he lost in straight sets to Nadal in last year\u2019s final, plus in the semi-finals two years ago. Ultimately Nadal, the 11-time champion, will be happy it\u2019s Thiem on the other side of the net instead of Djokovic. Play begins at 2pm BST and 3pm in Paris.

Corbyn joined protests outside Trump\u2019s press conference with Theresa May, where he pledged to oppose the US president\u2019s drive for greater access for US health companies to NHS contracts. The comments come at a time when Corbyn\u2019s team are nervous about the latest attempts to oust him from within the party over the issues of antisemitism and Brexit, after several senior figures came out in support of a second referendum. Shadow cabinet sources said the leadership was preparing to take on Tom Watson and his supporters after his vocal campaign to soften Corbyn\u2019s Brexit position, with moves under way to generate momentum in favour of a new deputy leadership election. There is growing talk about the possibility of the party\u2019s rules being changed to create a second deputy leader, alongside Watson, but also the possibility of a new deputy leadership contest altogether.

      "bodyText": "Millions of people in Sudan have joined a general strike called by pro-reform groups, shutting down the centre of cities across the country despite a wave of arrests and intimidation. The massive shutdown was called to take place on Sunday, the first day of the working week, and is aimed at relaunching an opposition movement battered by a brutal crackdown and forcing the country\u2019s new military leaders to resign. Shops were closed and streets were empty throughout the capital, Khartoum, and in the neighbouring Omdurman. Four protesters were killed in sporadic violence in the two cities. The Sudanese Professionals Association, a leading opposition group, said it had called on people to stay home in protest at the deaths of more than 100 people on Monday last week, when security forces violently dispersed a pro-democracy sit-in outside the military headquarters in Khartoum. \u201cThe peaceful resistance by civil disobedience and the general political strike is the fastest and most effective way to topple the military council \u2026 and to hand over power to a transitional civilian authority,\u201d the SPA said. The military took power after ousting the then president, Omar al-Bashir, in April after months of mass rallies. The ruling Transitional Military Council has since refused demonstrators\u2019 demands for an immediate move to civilian rule, instead pushing for a transitional power-sharing arrangement. Talks between the opposition Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces alliance and the TMC, which took power after Bashir\u2019s departure, ground to a halt last month then collapsed altogether after the raid on the protest camp. Residents said heavily armed paramilitaries from the Rapid Support Forces were patrolling parts of Khartoum while the regular army has now deployed in some parts of Omdurman. The RSF, which is largely made up of militias accused of systemic human rights abuses during the war in Darfur, has been blamed for the killings last week. The force is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo \u2013 known as Hemedti \u2013 who also serves as the deputy head of the TMC. The Sudan Doctors\u2019 Committee, the medical affiliate of the SPA, said at least three people were killed on Sunday, including a young man who was shot dead by the RSF in Khartoum\u2019s Bahri neighbourhood. The other two died of their injuries after RSF forces beat them in Omdurman, it said. Activists say that professionals including bankers, doctors, air traffic control staff, pilots, electrical engineers and economists have been targeted by intelligence services in what they say is an obvious attempt to break the strike. The central bank issued a statement that said it would not go on strike, but many employees stayed away. \u201cI am on strike along with many other employees at the bank, I think there are [a] few of our colleagues didn\u2019t go on strike but they sold the blood of the martyrs \u2026 I don\u2019t care even if they kick me out. God will decide,\u201d one told the Guardian. The SPA said airport workers and pilots were taking part in the civil disobedience, and posted photos of a deserted Khartoum international airport. \u201cDozens of airport workers have been arrested by intelligence and the RSF since Monday. We do not know their whereabouts,\u201d an airport worker said on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisal. Activists said the total number of people detained by security services in recent days was unclear but was probably in the hundreds. Two opposition leaders who met the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in Khartoum on Friday have been detained, along with an opposition spokesman. Abiy was in the Sudanese capital to mediate between the TMC and the opposition, which has refused to reopen negotiations. The internet remains cut off in Khartoum, with other communications significantly restricted. Sudan\u2019s military leaders have come under increasing international pressure in recent days. The brutal crackdown prompted outrage in the west while the African Union suspended the country and threatened sanctions if there was no swift transition to democracy. Even Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates appear to be moderating their previous policy of unconditional support for the TMC, after calls to senior officials from counterparts in Washington. The TMC will be hoping the opposition will not be able to sustain the shutdown for longer than a few days and, if the strike continues, will face a difficult choice: make concessions or intensify repression, risking further isolation and economic difficulties.",

Not even a spirited challenge by the world No 4, Dominic Thiem, could stop the 33-year-old Spaniard winning the French Open for a 12th time on Sunday, a feat unlikely to be matched in their lifetimes, if ever.</p> \n<p>For two sets the 25-year-old Austrian made a proper fight of it. But Nadal responded to the threat by tearing through the final two sets like the wind that has disrupted the schedule over the past few days to win 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 in three hours.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jun/09/rafael-nadal-v-dominic-thiem-french-open-mens-final-live\">Rafael Nadal beats Dominic Thiem to win French Open men's final \u2013 live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In his previous 11 finals only a handful of players have detained him longer than Thiem: Mariano Puerta on Nadal\u2019s winning debut as a teenager in 2005, Roger Federer three times and Novak Djokovic in his toughest final, seven years ago. But a string of dazzled contenders have fallen with embarrassing haste \u2013 most notably Federer, when Nadal took only an hour and 48 minutes in allowing him only four games in 2008.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, Court Philippe Chatrier was Nadal\u2019s again, and for ever. There surely is a case to rename the stadium \u2013 or some part of Roland Garros \u2013 after the Spaniard when he retires. He owns the place metaphorically and spiritually already.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt is incredible. I am very, very happy,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cIt is something very special. It is difficult to imagine winning so much in the same place, particularly here at Roland Garros. You cannot say it is a dream, because I never dreamed of such a thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nadal confirmed later that long-term and recurring injuries eased just long enough for him to compete here. \u201cI have had a very difficult year with a lot of physical problems. One month ago I didn\u2019t even know I would be here. For me, the simple fact of having tried, having trained well in the last weeks to come back, is my biggest satisfaction.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a6f71110-2d4b-4dbd-b3a8-5690022cf5dc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/W9Ed2UMEvJI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Nadal is the only player to win a dozen grand slam titles on the same court (Margaret Court won her 12 Australian Open titles at different venues), which also puts him four clear of Federer\u2019s eight championships at Wimbledon and Novak Djokovic\u2019s seven in Melbourne. Nadal moves to 18 majors, two behind Federer, three ahead of Djokovic.</p> \n<p>But Nadal says he is content with what he has achieved. \u201cYou cannot be thinking \u2018one more\u2019 all the time, otherwise you are never happy. You want more money, a bigger house, a new boat, an even prettier girlfriend! You cannot be happy like that \u2013 I don\u2019t like the frustration. You have to thank life for all that it gives you.\u201d</p> \n<p>For the foreseeable future the game\u2019s four biggest prizes remain the property of the old guard. The Big Three of Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have shared 10 successive grand slam titles. The last player outside the exclusive club to disturb their hegemony was Stan Wawrinka, who defeated Djokovic to win the 2016 US Open.</p> \n<p>This was Nadal\u2019s 950th win on the Tour, behind Federer on 1,207 victories, Jimmy Connors on 1,156 and Ivan Lendl on 1,096. It was his 260th match win in a slam tournament; only Federer (347) and Djokovic (270) have more. Two people have beaten him here: Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009 and Djokovic in the 2015 quarter-finals. Otherwise, 93 opponents have fallen to his power and guile.</p> \n<p>They are daunting numbers that Thiem simply did not want to think about when he stepped on to the historic court to face Nadal in the final for the second year running.

      "bodyText": "Rafael Nadal, hair thinning, legs slowing imperceptibly but genius intact, remains unbeatable on the clay of Roland Garros. Not even a spirited challenge by the world No 4, Dominic Thiem, could stop the 33-year-old Spaniard winning the French Open for a 12th time on Sunday, a feat unlikely to be matched in their lifetimes, if ever. For two sets the 25-year-old Austrian made a proper fight of it. But Nadal responded to the threat by tearing through the final two sets like the wind that has disrupted the schedule over the past few days to win 6-3, 5-7, 6-1, 6-1 in three hours. In his previous 11 finals only a handful of players have detained him longer than Thiem: Mariano Puerta on Nadal\u2019s winning debut as a teenager in 2005, Roger Federer three times and Novak Djokovic in his toughest final, seven years ago. But a string of dazzled contenders have fallen with embarrassing haste \u2013 most notably Federer, when Nadal took only an hour and 48 minutes in allowing him only four games in 2008. On Sunday, Court Philippe Chatrier was Nadal\u2019s again, and for ever. There surely is a case to rename the stadium \u2013 or some part of Roland Garros \u2013 after the Spaniard when he retires. He owns the place metaphorically and spiritually already. \u201cIt is incredible. I am very, very happy,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cIt is something very special. It is difficult to imagine winning so much in the same place, particularly here at Roland Garros. You cannot say it is a dream, because I never dreamed of such a thing.\u201d Nadal confirmed later that long-term and recurring injuries eased just long enough for him to compete here. \u201cI have had a very difficult year with a lot of physical problems. One month ago I didn\u2019t even know I would be here. For me, the simple fact of having tried, having trained well in the last weeks to come back, is my biggest satisfaction.\u201d Nadal is the only player to win a dozen grand slam titles on the same court (Margaret Court won her 12 Australian Open titles at different venues), which also puts him four clear of Federer\u2019s eight championships at Wimbledon and Novak Djokovic\u2019s seven in Melbourne. Nadal moves to 18 majors, two behind Federer, three ahead of Djokovic. But Nadal says he is content with what he has achieved. \u201cYou cannot be thinking \u2018one more\u2019 all the time, otherwise you are never happy. You want more money, a bigger house, a new boat, an even prettier girlfriend! You cannot be happy like that \u2013 I don\u2019t like the frustration. You have to thank life for all that it gives you.\u201d For the foreseeable future the game\u2019s four biggest prizes remain the property of the old guard. The Big Three of Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have shared 10 successive grand slam titles. The last player outside the exclusive club to disturb their hegemony was Stan Wawrinka, who defeated Djokovic to win the 2016 US Open. This was Nadal\u2019s 950th win on the Tour, behind Federer on 1,207 victories, Jimmy Connors on 1,156 and Ivan Lendl on 1,096. It was his 260th match win in a slam tournament; only Federer (347) and Djokovic (270) have more. Two people have beaten him here: Robin Soderling in the fourth round in 2009 and Djokovic in the 2015 quarter-finals. Otherwise, 93 opponents have fallen to his power and guile. They are daunting numbers that Thiem simply did not want to think about when he stepped on to the historic court to face Nadal in the final for the second year running. Having outlasted Djokovic over two days during a match hit by rain and high winds, he did not show any appreciable signs of fatigue until the closing few games of the match, by which time the result was inevitable. \u201cThe beginning was unbelievably intense,\u201d Thiem said. He got the first break point, outsmarting the king of Paris in a high-grade exchange in the fifth game \u2013 and he cashed in with a smash at the net. But, just as it looked as if the Spaniard had a fight on his hands, Thiem\u2019s racket shook and they were back on level terms. Nadal answered a drop shot with a better one of his own, grabbed two break points and, after forcing a tired forehand out of Thiem, served out the set. Nadal\u2019s concentration dipped in the second as they battled on level terms to four-all, before Thiem won 12 points in a row on his way to levelling at a set apiece. It looked a very even contest at that point but Hurricane Rafa struck hard and fast, forehands whipped with venom from all parts. He allowed Thiem just a single point in the first nine minutes of the third set and the former champion Mats Wilander was moved to observe: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you can play tennis any better than this.\u201d The fourth was much of the same, although Thiem\u2019s doggedness was admirable. Desperation invaded his work at 1-4 down, however, and Nadal served out the match to 30, before descending to the clay, where he has never looked so at home. As Thiem succinctly put it: \u201cHe stepped on me.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "In the run-up to his 2016 campaign to be Tory leader, Michael Gove was being subjected to a mock media interview by his team, as they tried to anticipate what questions he could face from journalists. In his soon-to-be published biography, Michael Gove: A Man in a Hurry, the journalist Owen Bennett writes that the then justice secretary was asked if he had ever taken drugs. \u201cYes, cocaine,\u201d he replied, according to someone described as having \u201cintimate knowledge of the event\u201d. According to Bennett: \u201cHe was firmly instructed not to give that answer in public, and told instead to fall back on the words [David] Cameron had used when he was running for leader, namely that politicians are entitled to a private life before entering politics.\u201d As the Daily Mail prepared to publish that anecdote in an extract of Bennett\u2019s book on Saturday, the environment secretary was forced to come clean. \u201cThe book is correct,\u201d Gove said. \u201cI did take drugs. It is something I deeply regret. Drugs damage lives. They are dangerous and it was a mistake. \u201cObviously it will be for my colleagues in parliament and members of the Conservative party to decide now if I should be leader. I think all politicians have lives before politics. Certainly, when I was working as a journalist, I didn\u2019t imagine I would go into politics or public service. I didn\u2019t act with an eye to that.\u201d The story quickly made it to the second edition front pages of Saturday\u2019s Daily Telegraph, the Sun, the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express, and its position at the top of the news agenda was established. The revelations have provoked criticism from across the political spectrum, with the former senior drug adviser to the government Prof David Nutt telling the Observer that Gove\u2019s disclosure was more proof that privileged politicians felt able \u201cto break the law, but not for others to do the same\u201d. Craig Oliver, who was the former prime minister David Cameron\u2019s chief spin doctor, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that the admission could become an issue that overshadowed Gove\u2019s leadership campaign messages, as the Tory rank and file were very socially conservative. The following day, the Mail on Sunday reported claims that in 1999 Gove had written a column urging tougher action against cocaine use shortly before hosting a party at his Mayfair flat where guests were openly taking the drug.

The environment secretary looked rattled and uncomfortable under tough lines of questioning about whether he should have gone to prison for taking Class A drugs and if it was right for teachers to have been banned from their profession for similar conduct. The mood among the other leadership campaigns was one of excitement that the second place in the contest looked wide open, with the teams of Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock all feeling they were in with a chance again to take on the likely frontrunner, Boris Johnson. However, there was also nervousness about the level of skulduggery going on behind the scenes, as many of the advisers on the various campaigns have worked together closely in the past and have the potential to know a multitude of political secrets that might harm their rivals. The \u201cclean campaign\u201d pledge signed by some of the candidates may yet be overtaken by events. The best guess of Gove supporters was that someone working for a rival might have spoken to Bennett about Gove\u2019s initial confession in 2015. The Mail on Sunday ran reports that Gove supporters suspected Beth Armstrong, an aide to Dominic Raab who used to work for Gove, of having leaked the information. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take Sherlock to work out how this got out,\u201d one insider told the paper.

Nineteen candidates for the presidential nomination were due to give five-minute speeches at the Democratic Party Hall of Fame dinner in Cedar Rapids \u2013 among them leading contenders Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Kamala Harris.

I think we have an excellent chance to win here, we\u2019re going to win in New Hampshire, and I think we have a very strong chance of being the candidate who will defeat the worst president in the modern history of this country, Donald Trump.\u201d One of the candidates with 2% in Iowa, Klobuchar, told CBS she could build support by being a midwestern senator \u201crunning on a track record of getting things done\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m clearly on the debate stage and expect to be there in the fall,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to give opportunity to voters in Iowa and all across the country to really narrow it down.\u201d Her fellow two-percenter, O\u2019Rourke, a charismatic candidate whose polling numbers have nonetheless gone into reverse, also played down the Iowa poll. \u201cIf I relied on polls in any race that I\u2019d run,\u201d he told ABC\u2019s This Week, \u201cI never would have been able to serve in the United States Congress. We never would have tried to take on Ted Cruz.\u201d That was a reference to the 2018 Texas Senate race which O\u2019Rourke lost to a Republican incumbent. Asked why he thought he was the man to beat Trump, the former congressman focused on his roots in a strongly Republican state and his stance against the president on the hot-button issue of immigration. Biden has so far focused on states where he polls strongly against Trump, including his native Pennsylvania and the post-industrial \u201crust belt\u201d, where the president beat Clinton on his way to victory in the electoral college despite a near-3-million-ballot defeat in the popular vote. In an interview with the Guardian published on Sunday, Bruce Haines, a former steel executive and Trump supporter from Northampton county, Pennsylvania, pointed to a main issue of contention in Democratic ranks nationwide. Should the party pick a progressive with bold policy ideas, such as Sanders or Warren, or should it opt for Biden or O\u2019Rourke, centrists with high name recognition in blue-collar or Republican-leaning states away from the liberal coasts? \u201cSo I think support [for Trump] is going to strengthen as we get closer to the election,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd as we sort out who he\u2019s going to run against \u2013 will it be a socialist, or will it be Biden?\u201d",

In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar.\u201d</p> <p>However, in a GQ interview in 2007, the Tory leadership frontrunner admitted to trying cocaine and cannabis at university, saying it \u201cachieved no pharmacological, psychotropic or any other effect on me whatsoever\u201d.</p> <h2>Jeremy Hunt</h2> <p>The foreign secretary told the Times: \u201cI think I had a cannabis lassi when I went backpacking through India\u201d.

From cannabis yogurt drinks to opium at weddings, here are their confessions. Boris Johnson Appearing on Have I Got News For You in 2005, Johnson said: \u201cI think I was once given cocaine, but I sneezed and so it did not go up my nose. In fact, I may have been doing icing sugar.\u201d However, in a GQ interview in 2007, the Tory leadership frontrunner admitted to trying cocaine and cannabis at university, saying it \u201cachieved no pharmacological, psychotropic or any other effect on me whatsoever\u201d. Jeremy Hunt The foreign secretary told the Times: \u201cI think I had a cannabis lassi when I went backpacking through India\u201d. He added: \u201cThat is almost as naughty as wheat fields,\u201d referring to Theresa May\u2019s widely ridiculed answer when she was asked about the naughtiest thing she\u2019s ever done. Andrea Leadsom Responding to the revelations of Gove\u2019s drug-taking, Leadsom said she had smoked cannabis at university, but had never done it since. \u201cI have never taken cocaine or class A drugs,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cEveryone is entitled to a private life before becoming an MP.\u201d Dominic Raab Raab, who had already admitted taking cannabis as a student, said: \u201cAt university, I tried cannabis, not very often as I was into sport.

Matt Hancock A source close to Hancock told the Telegraph he had \u201ctried cannabis a few times as a student but has not taken any illicit drugs since\u201d. Esther McVey McVey told ITV she had never taken any class A drugs. \u201cI have never taken any class A drugs, but have I tried some pot? Yes I have.

      "bodyText": "And with that, goodbye. Thanks for reading everyone, and there will be a full report on site soon. Cheers! Brazil might not be among the main challengers for this World Cup, but they showed enough here to suggest they will be dangerous, at least. And all without Marta. At the very least, they\u2019ll be delighted to have ended that nine-game losing run. You\u2019d expect them to win the group, after this. Good game, that. Brazil were obviously the better team by some way but Jamaica were just threatening enough to make it interesting. That said, Brazil should have won by more than the three goals, the sterling efforts of the absurdly young Schneider in nets keeping the score down. Peeeeeeeeeep. 90 mins +4: Brazil have a three-on-two but stuff it up: Geyse\u2019s pass for Debinha is a bit overhit, but once she picks up the ball she chooses a glory shot rather than looking for either of her two colleagues in some space in the middle. The less said about where that shot ended up the better. 90 mins +2: Jamaica on the hunt for a consolation. A free-kick on the right side of the box is half-cleared, then Shaw puts in a cross from the left which also comes to nothing. 90 mins: Brilliant feet from Debinha out on the left, who spins and sends Plummer for a sandwich, clips a cross into the middle where Ludmilla and Schneider collide, both miss the ball and it\u2019s decreed that the forward fouled the keeper. Four minutes of added time are signalled. 88 mins: Another big chance goes a beggin\u2019. Ludmilla does superbly to nick the ball off the toes of a dawdling Plummer, but having done the hard bit and got through on goal, her shot is weak and wide. 86 mins: Jamaica are still going for a consolation, but don\u2019t seem to quite have the wit to break through. Shaw has had a bit of a thankless task up top, although she has looked pretty good. 83 mins: A bad couple of minutes for Daiane, who is winded after getting in the way of a rasping shot from Asher. 82 mins: A booking for Daiane, who gets her collar felt for taking out Shaw with a late, hacking challenge. 80 mins: Another big miss by Brazil, not that it especially matters. A rare error in judgement from Schneider as she comes out to cut out a through ball but can\u2019t get there ahead of Geyse, who nips around the keeper, but the angle is too tight for a shot so cuts it back across goal. Ludmilla is presented with a sort of open goal (a few defenders were in the area) but she sticks it into the side-netting. 79 mins: Final sub for Jamaica: Trudi Carter is withdrawn, in favour of Tiffany Cameron. 78 mins: Brilliant save from Schneider! Geyse, who has looked lively since coming on, collects the ball after a slick passing interchange and shoots low, and left-footed, but Schneider sprawls away down to her left and flips the ball wide. It could genuinely have been five or six if not for the 19-year-old in Jamaica\u2019s nets. 75 mins: Another change for Brazil, as Diane replaces Kathellen, who had been in some injury bother in the last few minutes. 73 mins: Shaw bullies Kathellen out of possession and looks for a crossfield pass, but slips just as she is drawing her foot back and the chance is gone. 72 mins: Another sub for Jamaica: Havana Solaun goes off, Chinyelu Asher comes on. 71 mins: Corner for Brazil after a quiet couple of minutes, but in the middle Ludmilla is penalised for a handball. 67 mins: Kathellen does herself some form of mischief in blocking a Shaw shot, but after a bit of treatment she seems fine. From the resultant corner, Barbara claims easily. 65 mins: Double sub for Brazil: that\u2019s a good day\u2019s work for Cristiane who, along with Beatriz is taken off, to be replaced by Geyse and Ludmilla. 64 mins: Cristiane herself is fouled just outside the D and to the left. She steps up and pings a free-kick off the bar, it bounces down behind the line and for fans of these sort of aesthetics bounces up and hits the bar again, but the ref\u2019s watch buzzes and Cristiane\u2019s treble is complete. Hat-trick for Cristiane! 62 mins: Sub for Jamaica: Cheyna Matthews off, Jody Brown on. 61 mins: Oh good lord, how did she miss? Allyson Swaby clips a cross from the right over Barbara, and Carter is there at the far post to seemingly complete an easy finish, but she skews it into the side-netting. Huge chance for Jamaica, that. 59 mins: That free-kick from deep is skimmed into the box by Sweatman, Barbara absolutely steams off her line to claim it but Shaw gets there first, flicks it on past the keeper but Allyson Swaby can\u2019t quite get there to divert into the empty net. 58 mins: Ooof. The old stager Formiga goes into the book, much to her chagrin: she tackles Shaw from behind, with the first swing seeming to get something on the ball but the trailing leg took the Jamaica forward out. 57 mins: The corner comes to nothing. Meanwhile, a point worth making about the penalty earlier. 56 mins: Debinha tries a shot that we can file under \u2018 optimistic\u2019 from way downtown, but it\u2019s deflected and spins wide. 54 mins: A Jamaica attack, but snuffed out: Carter takes a shot from just inside the area, which is blocked and they can\u2019t get the cross back in. 51 mins: Brazil are in again, with Debinha scrapping to find her way through on goal, but she loses her footing - in her opinion but crucially not the ref\u2019s - thanks to a shove from her marker, and Schneider does just about enough to stop her. 50 mins: Fairly simple one this time. Andressa puts in a low, searching cross betwixt keeper and defence, Schneider just misses it and Cristiane arrives at the back post with an open goal but a tight angle, and despite Plummer\u2019s best efforts the ball goes over the line. Lead, doubled! 49 mins: Some holes open in the Jamaica defence and the ball falls to Cristiane, but her shot deflects wide. 48 mins: Plummer brings the ball out of defence well but with Shaw making a run right, she passes left and straight to a defender. 46 mins: Jamaica start the second half by knocking the ball around a bit, something that they didn\u2019t do so much in the opening 45. We\u2019re back out for the second half. No changes for either side, that I can see. Cracking game, this. Cristiane\u2019s goal was top drawer, the perfect header from a perfect cross, but Brazil should really be further ahead, not least due to that missed penalty. That said, what Jamaica\u2019s attacks have lacked in frequency they have made up for in potency: they could have scored two or three times, and the only real surprise is there\u2019s only been one goal so far. Peeeeeeeeeeep. 45 mins: One minute of added time. Boos greet a free-kick awarded to Brazil. 44 mins: Bond-Flasza goes long, looking for the run of Shaw, but the pass is too strong. 41 mins: Also just reminding ourselves that Schneider is 19 years old and plays her domestic football for the University of North Carolina. She\u2019s playing like a 15-year-old veteran at the moment. 40 mins: Brazil should be pretty vexed that they\u2019re not further ahead in this one, but Jamaica could easily be level. Football, isn\u2019t it. 38 mins: The excellent keeping in this game continues, although Schneider had moved a couple of steps to her right, but Andressa doesn\u2019t read the telegraph correctly and goes low and not very hard in that direction, allowing Schneider to save. 37 mins: Seems harsh. The ball is thwacked at Allyon Swaby from about two yards away, it hits the arm and thus a penalty is given. It\u2019s checked by VAR but it stands, and up steps Andressa... 36 mins: Yeesh, Jamaica could be level. Barbara comes out for a cross which looks like it might have dipped a bit before she reached it. She catches, but it squirts from her grasp like an errant bar of soap and it pops out to Shaw, who shoots but Barbara is up as quick as a flash to block and redeem herself. 34 mins: The late, late, late offside flag strikes again, as it has a number of times in the tournament: Leticia Santos puts a brilliant pass through to Cristiane, who\u2019s about two yards offside but the lino waits until next Thursday to signal it. 31 mins: Brazil should probably be two ahead. Debinha gets down the left, cuts back into the middle where - I think - Andressa is waiting with a clear shot on goal about 12 yards out, but Cristiane nicks it off her toes, miscontrols and the chance disappears. 29 mins: Yowzers. From virtually nowhere Shaw, on the run and just outside the box on the right, hammers a shot towards the top corner but Barbara sticks up a mitt and tips the stinging effort over the bar. Both keepers have been terrific so far. 27 mins: Super work by Schneider in the Jamaica goal, as she comes out for a chest-high cross with Debinha and Cristiane lurking, and she deserves the bit of luck she gets as the ball pops back into her arms. 26 mins: Two Brazilian defenders - Kathellen and Monica - collide with each other and one bounces off and bashes into Carter, but for reasons unclear that\u2019s deemed a foul by the Jamaican forward. Weird. 25 mins: Huge chance for Brazil as Debinha finds herself through on goal after a brilliant pass through by Andressa, but she gets the ball stuck under her feet slightly and the shot is weak. Cristiane was screaming for it square, but the replays suggest she would have been offside had the pass come. 24 mins: Most of Jamaica\u2019s threat seems to have come from big crosses into the box looking for Shaw, which they try again, but once more Barbara is up to it and clears the cross. 21 mins: Beatriz hassles the ball off Blackwood in the Jamaica left-back slot, cuts inside but loses it before she has a chance to shoot. 19 mins: Matthews looks lively down the Jamaica right, but as she sprints and lollipops her way down the flank Formiga decides that this young sprite must be taught a thing or two, and puts in a fair but crunching tackle, leaving Matthews to briefly consider her life choices on the Grenoble turf. 18 mins: Andressa, who\u2019s been at the heart of everything Brazil have done so far, curls the free-kick harmlessly over the bar. 17 mins: Brazil not letting up and they\u2019re on the attack again, inducing a foul and indeed yellow card as Plummer takes out Thaisa around 30 yards from goal. 15 mins: Brazil have been knock, knock, knockin\u2019 on the door, and they burst through it after Andressa is given too much time to pick out a cross from the left, landing it right on Cristiane\u2019s head who superbly guides it inside the far post. What a header! 14 mins: Brazil have dominated but Jamaica have the first proper effort on target, as Shaw cuts in from the left and shoots earlier than the defenders were expecting, but it doesn\u2019t fool Barbara, who saves with relative ease at the near post. 12 mins: A free-kick for Brazil deep on the left, which Andressa booms into the box. Monica goes up for the header but glances it wide. Cannot confirm whether she said \u2018the ball is mine\u2019 as she went up for it. 11 mins: The players have briefly paused for breath, perhaps for the benefit of minute-by-minuters with frantic fingers. Debinha tries to get in behind the defence again but Plummer arrives to muscle her out. 8 mins: All action here. Matthews lofts a cross into the middle where Shaw is waiting, but Barbara does well to come out and claim. Then Brazil zoot up the other end, Debinha is set free behind the Jamaica defence and tries to go around Schneider, but the keeper does brilliantly to paw the ball away, and then deal with the follow-up from Brazil\u2019s No.9. 6 mins: Another corner for Brazil, this one from the left which Debinha zings in, but Schneider advances off her line and punches clear. Jamaica attack for the first time after Leticia Santos underhits a backpass to Barbara, but she just gets there in time to clear. 4 mins: That corner is cleared at the back post. Brazil look like they\u2019re going for the jugular straight away so it will be a tough old task to see if the Jamaicans can hold out, and how long for. 3 mins: Another corner for Brazil, which drops to Thaisa on the edge of the box but her effort is deflected behind for...another corner. A slightly frantic start here. 2 mins: The corner comes to nothing and is cleared upfield. It\u2019s lucky that Brazil keeper Barbara was looking sharp, because she had to advance to clear the thing from the edge of the centre circle, with Shaw lurking. 1 min: We\u2019re away. Brazil win a corner straight away as Blackwood nips ahead of Debinha to put it behind. As has just been pointed out on the BBC, this is Formiga\u2019s seventh - SEVENTH - World Cup. She made her debut in 1995, meaning she has been playing international football for longer than six of the Jamaica players have been alive. The Brazilian anthem, a highlight of any World Cup, rings out. The good news is I\u2019ve just had a quick look at the lyrics and it\u2019s not one of those about marauding across foreign lands or pillaging etc, so you\u2019re safe. Here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s report from the other game in this group, as Italy beat Australia with that late goal. How late? Very late. The weather looks hazy but the mood seems lively in Grenoble. The players are gathering in the tunnel. Let\u2019s football. Fancy some team guides? Look no further: Brazil Jamaica A dramatic finish to the preceding game, where Italy have just beaten Australia with a late, late, late, late, late header. You\u2019ll note that Khadija \u2018Bunny\u2019 Shaw is starting up top for Jamaica. She was of course named the Guardian footballer of the year for 2018. Here\u2019s her interview with Bryan Arnhem Graham to explain why. Advantage Jamaica. Brazil Barbara; Letica, Kathellen, Monica, Tamires; Andressa, Thaisa, Formiga, Debinha; Bia Zaneratto, Cristiane. Jamaica Schneider; Bond-Flasza, Plummer, Allyson Swaby, Blackwood; Chantelle Swaby, Solaun, Sweatman; Matthews, Shaw, Carter. Team news will be along shortly, but just a reminder that, while this could be her last World Cup, Marta will miss this one with a thigh injury. The romantics among you may well be rooting for Brazil to go all the way in this tournament, what with it quite possibly/probably being the last hurrah of Marta, six-time world player of the year, Golden Ball winner at the 2007 tournament and quite probably the greatest player ever. But while plenty have tipped England, France, Japan, Germany - who simply must not be written off, a sentiment transcending sport and gender - basically nobody has mentioned Brazil. Is there a reason for that? Well, yes. They\u2019re not very good. Since winning the Copa America last year they\u2019ve been utter toilet, losing their last nine games, including a wipeout in the SheBelieves Cup, and while you can decide for yourself how relevant that tournament actually is, all in all it\u2019s not the greatest sign in the world for their chances in France. As for Jamaica, this is their first time at the World Cup so there will inevitably be a \u2018happy to be here\u2019 vibe about them and their primary aim will be to get out of the group. Will all of that actually make for a decent game here? Possibly. These are after all two teams on whom there might not be much expectation, potentially freeing them up to play a bit more expressively. Or it could simply turn out that neither side is very good and it will be rubbish. Only one way to find out. Kick-off: 14.30 BST",

But we\u2019ll keep chipping away and try our best to get to No 1.\u201d The British grass holds fond memories for Barty, who returned from her two-year exile at Eastbourne in 2016. \u201cI was very nervous,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI only got in the draw because it wasn\u2019t full in qualifying. It was pretty nice to be back and almost slip into tournament mode straight away. My routines and my habits came back very quickly. I remember at the end of the week my body was shot. I wasn\u2019t used to playing matches again. I played some pretty good tennis considering it was my first matches back. It feels like yesterday I was there.\u201d There is a strand of candour running through nearly everything she says. She sugarcoats nothing and embraces the bad with the good, admitting after her semi-final win over Amanda Anisimova that she had played, \u201csome brilliant tennis and some awful tennis\u201d. That made it logical to believe her assessment after dismissing Vondrousova in 70 minutes in the final, that she had played \u201cthe perfect match\u201d. She has other incentives to match Goolagong Cawley, who texted her after the win. \u201cThe pathways and the progress that we\u2019ve made for indigenous youth in Australia have been incredible,\u201d Barty said. \u201cThere have been more opportunities. There\u2019s more publicity and people are actually aware that there is a pathway for indigenous youths to enjoy, not only in tennis but all other sports. \u201cTennis is now becoming a nationwide sport for indigenous youth. It\u2019s incredible to know what Evonne has done and how passionate she is about it. If I can have any small part in it, that would be incredible.\u201d Her parents, Josie and Robert \u2013 who watched the final on TV in the UK after landing at Heathrow from Australia on the day of the match \u2013 will be with her for the second chapter of her summer odyssey. \u201cThey were with family,\u201d Barty said. \u201cI have some great aunts and uncles in Nottingham. They were with them at their place all glued to the TV.\u201d Barty remembers Nottingham for other reasons: the final there against Konta a year ago, which she won from 4-1 down in the third. It was not such a happy occasion for Konta, whose \u201cacceptance\u201d briefly deserted her when she described a line call against in the penultimate game as \u201ca joke\u201d. All part of the journey, of course. On Sunday Barty, who played two seasons of women\u2019s Big Bash before returning to tennis, watched Australia\u2019s World Cup match against India on TV in Paris. \u201cI sent JL [Justin Langer, the coach] a quick message saying I would have loved to have been there. It was really nice to hear from them as well. I\u2019ll be glued to the TV and I will make sure I see it.\u201d Martina Navratilova is among many former players and experts who expect Barty\u2019s run to continue \u2013 on the tennis court. \u201cThis could be a great springboard for her,\u201d she said. \u201cI am so glad the sport has got her back. She must be one of the favourites for Wimbledon now. She has the slice and great variety in her game. I don\u2019t think she is a one-slam wonder. I think we will see her win again.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Quit now, rather than later</strong><br></h2> <p>Smokers who try to gradually taper down the amount they smoke are <a href=\"http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2016-03-15-if-you-want-quit-smoking-do-it-now\" title=\"\">less likely</a> to quit than those who do so abruptly. \u201cThe problem with quitting smoking is it\u2019s something you can always do tomorrow,\u201d says Paul Aveyard, a professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford. \u201cCommitting to a day, and making that the day, is the key to success.\u201d This is because of the way the brain learns and unlearns patterns of addiction. \u201cThe urges to smoke can be unlearned, providing you never have a cigarette at those moments of temptation,\u201d he says. \u201cSo having a sneaky one now and again is just going to prolong the agony.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Don\u2019t be afraid of nicotine</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stop-smoking-treatments/\" title=\"\">NHS recommends</a> that a combination of nicotine replacement therapies \u2013 such as a nicotine patch along with faster acting forms, such as gum or nasal spray \u2013 is far more effective than relying on a single therapy. Many smokers don\u2019t use as much nicotine as they should when trying to quit, says Leonie Brose, of King\u2019s College London\u2019s National Addiction Centre. \u201cThe general thing is not to be afraid of nicotine replacements. A patch is a good baseline, but you also need something that acts quickly when you get a craving.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Try e-cigarettes</strong></h2> <p>If nicotine patches don\u2019t work, e-cigarettes are definitely worth a try. <a href=\"https://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/2019/smd/e-cigarettes-more-effective-than-nicotine-replacement-therapies-finds-major-uk-clinical-trial.html\" title=\"\">A recent study found</a> them to be almost twice as effective at helping smokers quit. \u201cThere\u2019s that behavioural component, which some other medications for stopping smoking don\u2019t have,\u201d says Nicola Lindson, a behavioural medicine researcher at the University of Oxford. \u201cVaping gives people something to do with their hands and can help with the social element of smoking, too. We do still need more data on the safety of e-cigarettes, but we are pretty certain that they\u2019re a lot less bad for your health than smoking.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Seek support</strong></h2> <p>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence <a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/qs43/chapter/Quality-statement-3-Behavioural-support-with-pharmacotherapy\" title=\"\">guidelines emphasise that</a> behavioural support, not just pharmacotherapies, is crucial to successfully quitting smoking. Whether this comes in the form of family or friends, or counselling from your <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/smokefree/help-and-advice/local-support-services-helplines\" title=\"\">local Stop Smoking service</a>, this can help give smokers a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4089707/\" title=\"\">motivation to quit.</a></p> <h2><strong>Avoid</strong><strong> triggers</strong></h2> <p>Every smoker has <a href=\"https://smokefree.gov/challenges-when-quitting/cravings-triggers/know-your-triggers\" title=\"\">triggers</a> that make them crave a cigarette. Aveyard says changing your daily routine to avoid those temptations is important in the early stages of quitting. \u201cPeople usually smoke in a very stereotyped manner, at particular times. If you can break those routines, then you will reduce the chances of giving in to temptation and allow your brain to recover.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Quit now, rather than later Smokers who try to gradually taper down the amount they smoke are less likely to quit than those who do so abruptly. \u201cThe problem with quitting smoking is it\u2019s something you can always do tomorrow,\u201d says Paul Aveyard, a professor of behavioural medicine at the University of Oxford. \u201cCommitting to a day, and making that the day, is the key to success.\u201d This is because of the way the brain learns and unlearns patterns of addiction. \u201cThe urges to smoke can be unlearned, providing you never have a cigarette at those moments of temptation,\u201d he says. \u201cSo having a sneaky one now and again is just going to prolong the agony.\u201d Don\u2019t be afraid of nicotine The NHS recommends that a combination of nicotine replacement therapies \u2013 such as a nicotine patch along with faster acting forms, such as gum or nasal spray \u2013 is far more effective than relying on a single therapy. Many smokers don\u2019t use as much nicotine as they should when trying to quit, says Leonie Brose, of King\u2019s College London\u2019s National Addiction Centre. \u201cThe general thing is not to be afraid of nicotine replacements. A patch is a good baseline, but you also need something that acts quickly when you get a craving.\u201d Try e-cigarettes If nicotine patches don\u2019t work, e-cigarettes are definitely worth a try. A recent study found them to be almost twice as effective at helping smokers quit. \u201cThere\u2019s that behavioural component, which some other medications for stopping smoking don\u2019t have,\u201d says Nicola Lindson, a behavioural medicine researcher at the University of Oxford. \u201cVaping gives people something to do with their hands and can help with the social element of smoking, too. We do still need more data on the safety of e-cigarettes, but we are pretty certain that they\u2019re a lot less bad for your health than smoking.\u201d Seek support National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines emphasise that behavioural support, not just pharmacotherapies, is crucial to successfully quitting smoking. Whether this comes in the form of family or friends, or counselling from your local Stop Smoking service, this can help give smokers a motivation to quit. Avoid triggers Every smoker has triggers that make them crave a cigarette. Aveyard says changing your daily routine to avoid those temptations is important in the early stages of quitting. \u201cPeople usually smoke in a very stereotyped manner, at particular times. If you can break those routines, then you will reduce the chances of giving in to temptation and allow your brain to recover.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson Pitch: The leader to see off the other parties \u2013 robust on Brexit and electorally appealing. Stance on Brexit: Insistent the UK will leave on 31 October, whether or not there is a deal. He is officially committed to trying to renegotiate the deal with the EU, and using \u201calternative arrangements\u201d for the Irish border. Domestic offer: His only commitment so far has been to increase the secondary schools budget in England to at least \u00a35,000 per pupil per year \u2013 a pledge that one analysis calculated would actually only mean a 0.1% rise in spending. Key supporters: Aside from Gavin Williamson (who is helping coordinate the campaign) and Liz Truss, Johnson has won backers across the spectrum from Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker on the hardline Eurosceptic wing to Johnny Mercer and Damian Collins on the more centrist side. Social media game: As with his entire campaign so far, quite low-key, although he did release a very glossy launch video. Chances of winning: Very good. Bookies have him as the odds-on favourite. Campaign so far: No disasters yet \u2013 which is precisely what Johnson needs. Michael Gove Pitch: Not Boris Johnson. The environment secretary is appealing to MPs as a reliable Brexiter who, unlike certain colleagues, always works hard and can focus on a brief. Stance on Brexit: Hard, but not overly hard. Gove has promised to go for no deal if needed, but has said he could countenance shifting the deadline a few weeks beyond 31 October if it meant a deal could happen. Domestic offer: He has also made a schools spending pledge, and more generous than Johnson \u2013 \u00a31bn extra a year. He has also promised free British citizenship for 3 million EU nationals after Brexit. Key supporters: Some influential Tory centrists such as George Freeman, Nicky Morgan and Tom Tugendhat have signed up, as well as more Brexit-minded colleagues such as Bob Seely. Social media game: Professional if not overly exciting, although his campaign video won praise. Chances of winning: Currently the second favourite, albeit on relatively distant odds of about 6/1. Campaign so far: Slow and steady, not least in amassing a fair number of MP nominations. However, his policies have been overshadowed by accusations of hypocrisy after he admitted taking cocaine as a young journalist. Jeremy Hunt Pitch: The competent moderate, who would still deliver Brexit but wouldn\u2019t scare off middle-ground voters. Stance on Brexit: Try to renegotiate a departure deal with a new team involving the DUP and Eurosceptics. If this was not possible, Hunt could go for no deal, but has said this would be \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d because it would bring a confidence vote and perhaps an election.

But has mocked the idea of proroguing parliament to ensure no deal as \u201ccomplete nonsense\u201d. Domestic offer: Unshackled from the wishes of Theresa May, the home secretary is opening up on immigration, saying he would scrap long-standing Tory net migration targets and make it easier for overseas students to stay on in the UK to work. Key supporters: Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader is a major coup, and he also has influential backbencher Robert Halfon and the culture secretary, Jeremy Wright. But is lagging behind the others in numbers. Social media game: Enthusiastic if mixed.

Also running Matt Hancock: The heir to George Osborne, with a centrist message and 14 backers so far, but seems unlikely to overtake Gove or Hunt to become the moderate candidate put to members. Andrea Leadsom: The pro-leave ex-leader of the house is having another shot after dropping out of the contest last time around against Theresa May, but her Eurosceptic colleagues seem to be flocking to Gove and Johnson. Mark Harper: A former chief whip barely known by the public, Harper will be glad to get past the first round of voting. Esther McVey: The former work and pensions secretary is even more of a Brexit ultra than Raab, saying she wants to leave with no deal without even trying to renegotiate. Sam Gyimah: The remainers\u2019 remainer in Tory terms. Quit government to seek a second referendum, but has yet to gain any public backers among MPs.",

      "body": "<p>In swimming, you try to keep your resistance in the water as low as you can, and generate propulsion to send you forwards. Breaststroke is the stroke that creates the most resistance. Your body should be flat in the water, arms straight out in front with hands together, and legs straight back with feet together. Loosely close your fingers, don\u2019t keep them tense, so you can maximise your hold on the water, and tilt your hands out and down at an angle so you can feel the pressure of the water on your palms. Shoot them forwards and sweep them outwards, just past shoulder width \u2013 don\u2019t take them too wide. Almost turn the corner with your hands and scoop back in, under the chest. Then shoot forwards into the front glide position.</p> <p>As you go forwards into the glide, bend the knees and bring the heels up to your backside. Again, don\u2019t go too wide \u2013 just within shoulder width. Turn your feet out to get a good connection on the water, then kick backwards. Most of your forward movement will come from your leg kick. The key is the timing. Start the propulsive part of the kick after you shoot your hands forwards into the glide. Keep your body as streamlined as you can at the front to maximise your kick. Your shoulders and head will lift as you sweep outwards and turn the corner, so that\u2019s when you breathe. A common mistake is lifting your head too soon, which sends the body position out of whack.</p> <p>If you are a confident fitness swimmer, you should place your head in the water during the glide position because you will get a lot more out of the stroke.</p> <p><em>Jamie Main, head coach at Derventio </em><em>eXcel performance swim squad, </em><em>was talking to Emine Saner</em></p>",

Shoot them forwards and sweep them outwards, just past shoulder width \u2013 don\u2019t take them too wide. Almost turn the corner with your hands and scoop back in, under the chest. Then shoot forwards into the front glide position. As you go forwards into the glide, bend the knees and bring the heels up to your backside. Again, don\u2019t go too wide \u2013 just within shoulder width. Turn your feet out to get a good connection on the water, then kick backwards. Most of your forward movement will come from your leg kick. The key is the timing. Start the propulsive part of the kick after you shoot your hands forwards into the glide. Keep your body as streamlined as you can at the front to maximise your kick. Your shoulders and head will lift as you sweep outwards and turn the corner, so that\u2019s when you breathe. A common mistake is lifting your head too soon, which sends the body position out of whack. If you are a confident fitness swimmer, you should place your head in the water during the glide position because you will get a lot more out of the stroke.

      "body": "<p>Bikini Kill never intended to reunite. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that crossed my mind as a possibility or anything that I would <em>want</em> to do,\u201d says drummer Tobi Vail. \u201cGoing back in time doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2017, two decades after they\u2019d parted ways, that the pioneering riot grrrl band witnessed a model for doing it. They\u2019d been asked to play a song at <a href=\"https://www.spin.com/2017/11/bikini-kill-reunites-opens-for-the-raincoats-in-new-york/\">a New York event in honour of the Raincoats</a>, prompted by a book about the London-based feminist punk group\u2019s self-titled 1979 album. In that room, Vail witnessed a group often erased from the punk canon writing their own history.</p> <p>\u201cThey were telling their story on their own terms,\u201d recalls Vail. \u201cThere\u2019s a power in seizing history. To me, that\u2019s what being a band allows you to access. If we see historicisation as an institutional force, let\u2019s be inclusive: let women\u2019s voices in.\u201d After that night, Bikini Kill watched as fans called their brief performance a \u201creunion\u201d. It \u201cfelt right\u201d, says Vail, so they decided to do more shows.</p> <p>Vail is calling from LA, singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/09/kathleen-hanna-the-julie-ruin-bikini-kill-interview\">Kathleen Hanna</a>\u2019s adopted home town, where the group have been rehearsing prior to the first leg of their tour in the US. She is firm that this it isn\u2019t just a nostalgia trip. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like an irrelevant, punk oldies thing.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, it\u2019s hard to tell whether it\u2019s depressing or galvanising that a mission begun three decades ago still feels so relevant. In the wilds of early 90s Olympia, in America\u2019s Pacific Northwest, Bikini Kill\u2019s \u201crevolution girl style now\u201d aimed to radicalise girls and women to take direct action against sexism. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jan/28/riot-grrrl-10-of-the-best\">riot grrrl</a> movement, founded by a coterie of like-minded bands and zine-makers nationwide, was about reclaiming a girlhood spoiled by misogyny.

      "bodyText": "Bikini Kill never intended to reunite. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something that crossed my mind as a possibility or anything that I would want to do,\u201d says drummer Tobi Vail. \u201cGoing back in time doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until 2017, two decades after they\u2019d parted ways, that the pioneering riot grrrl band witnessed a model for doing it. They\u2019d been asked to play a song at a New York event in honour of the Raincoats, prompted by a book about the London-based feminist punk group\u2019s self-titled 1979 album. In that room, Vail witnessed a group often erased from the punk canon writing their own history. \u201cThey were telling their story on their own terms,\u201d recalls Vail. \u201cThere\u2019s a power in seizing history. To me, that\u2019s what being a band allows you to access. If we see historicisation as an institutional force, let\u2019s be inclusive: let women\u2019s voices in.\u201d After that night, Bikini Kill watched as fans called their brief performance a \u201creunion\u201d. It \u201cfelt right\u201d, says Vail, so they decided to do more shows. Vail is calling from LA, singer Kathleen Hanna\u2019s adopted home town, where the group have been rehearsing prior to the first leg of their tour in the US. She is firm that this it isn\u2019t just a nostalgia trip. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like an irrelevant, punk oldies thing.\u201d Indeed, it\u2019s hard to tell whether it\u2019s depressing or galvanising that a mission begun three decades ago still feels so relevant. In the wilds of early 90s Olympia, in America\u2019s Pacific Northwest, Bikini Kill\u2019s \u201crevolution girl style now\u201d aimed to radicalise girls and women to take direct action against sexism. The riot grrrl movement, founded by a coterie of like-minded bands and zine-makers nationwide, was about reclaiming a girlhood spoiled by misogyny. Bikini Kill tackled rape culture, female solidarity and the pursuit of pleasure in Hanna\u2019s confrontational sing-song vocals, backed by abrasive, lo-fi playing. At gigs, they famously brought \u201cgirls to the front\u201d to provide a sanctuary from the aggression of male-dominated punk shows. Life in the band was tough. While celebrated by peers such as Kurt Cobain (Hanna wrote \u201cKurt smells like Teen Spirit\u201d on his bedroom wall, inspiring Nirvana\u2019s biggest hit), they were often abused at shows, with some men turning up specifically to cause trouble. Other feminist punks decried Hanna after the media crowned her the leader of a supposedly non-hierarchical scene. The male-dominated music press frequently mocked the band (\u201cMoronic nag-unto-vomit tantrums over stock school-of-Sabbath riffage,\u201d wrote Rolling Stone of their self-titled 1993 EP) or seemed intentionally to misinterpret them: Hanna was repeatedly and wrongly portrayed as a survivor of incestuous abuse. \u201cIt was extremely sexist and condescending,\u201d says Vail of the coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting now, so imagine processing that at the time. People can\u2019t even hear what you\u2019re saying [as a band] because it\u2019s filtered through these institutions.\u201d The riot grrrl movement encouraged boycotting the media.

Their success can\u2019t be overstated: it\u2019s impossible to imagine today\u2019s landscape without riot grrrl. After releasing three albums, Bikini Kill played their last show in Tokyo in 1997. \u201cThere were interpersonal conflicts,\u201d says Vail. \u201cWe\u2019d done everything we wanted to.

      "body": "<p>\u2018I\u2019m a person,\u201d says Tayari Jones, the morning after carrying off the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/05/womens-prize-for-fiction-tayari-jones-novel-an-american-marriage\" title=\"\">Women\u2019s prize for fiction for her fourth novel</a>, An American Marriage, \u201cwho before this had never even won a raffle. Truly. I remember, as a child, you could win a whole summer of ice-cream and I saved and I bought several tickets. I did not win and the little girl who won only had one ticket. How about that? I\u2019ve been holding that grudge for 40 years.\u201d</p> <p>An American Marriage, the story of a black man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/15/an-american-marriage-by-tayari-jones-review\" title=\"\">falsely imprisoned for a violent assault on a woman</a> he glancingly meets in an Atlanta motel, has certainly transformed Jones\u2019s literary fortunes. Crucially, it caught the eye of Oprah Winfrey, who last year selected it for her Book Club \u2013 a guarantee of enormously enhanced sales and profile. Then came the moment when the former US president Barack Obama included it on his<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/barackobama/posts/10156093753316749\" title=\"\"> increasingly celebrated list of summer reading</a>, praising its \u201cmoving portrayal of the effects of a wrongful conviction on a young African-American couple\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see what attracted Winfrey and Obama: the novel turns outwards to address the immense and seemingly intractable issues around the incarceration of black men, and at the same time never loses sight of the traumatic effects of injustice on its victims\u2019 most intimate relationships. As its title suggests, it\u2019s concerned not only with Roy, the young man from a working-class Atlanta family keen to grab all the opportunities life offers him, but with his wife, Celestial, an artist from a far more moneyed and socially elevated background. When I remark that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/29/feminist-retellings-of-history-dominate-2019-womens-prize-shortlist\" title=\"\">two of the writers shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize</a>, Pat Barker and Madeline Miller, set their stories in ancient Greece, Jones points out that An American Marriage is itself in conversation with The Odyssey, the story of a man trying simply to get home to his wife; and of a wife who, left alone to hold the fort, is faced with the dilemma of how far to proceed with her own life.</p> <p>When people question Jones about the minutiae of the crime at the book\u2019s heart, she counters strongly: \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be a story about the police. I don\u2019t want this to be a story about law enforcement. This is not a procedural. This is the story about a family affected by wrongful conviction, about what they owe each other and the ways that they will move forward. I think that when we forget that part of stories, we are actually dismantling community.\u201d</p> <p>Which is not to say that Jones, 48, turns away from the stark political realities the novel is built on; she spent a year at Harvard doing research for the book and, even on this short trip to Britain, has found time to visit Brixton prison in south London, home to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/18/ofm-awards-2015-best-ethical-restaurant-the-clink-hmp-brixton\" title=\"\">the inmate-run restaurant The Clink</a>. The decision to write about imprisonment, she says, \u201cwasn\u2019t any big lightning bolt. I feel that the idea of incarceration has always been, in many ways, the boogie man under the bed for black America. There\u2019s a fear, particularly among the middle class, that you\u2019ll do everything right \u2013 you\u2019ll go to school, you\u2019ll do this, you\u2019ll do that \u2013 and then the system will just come and abduct you. That is the monster under the bed, and I wanted to look under the bed and face it head on.\u201d She says her concern spreads beyond clear miscarriages of justice to encompass the vast numbers of those in jail for non-violent drug offences, or who are mentally ill. \u201cI\u2019m not only interested in the \u2018innocent people\u2019; when we make that distinction between innocent and not innocent, we miss the major issues about prison reform.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/05/womens-prize-for-fiction-tayari-jones-novel-an-american-marriage\">Women's prize for fiction goes to 'utterly moving' Tayari Jones novel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But while the horror thrown up by her research was stopping her from sleeping, it was not, she tells me, \u201cmoving my pen \u2026 I felt like I was trying to animate statistics\u201d. (She also recalls being advised to put more overt political content in the novel, \u201cas if I had some Black Lives Matter in my handbag\u201d.) Conscious of the advice that you should write fiction about people and their problems, not problems and their people, she one day found herself in a mall, tuning into a couple\u2019s argument. \u201cI heard the woman say: \u2018Roy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u2019 And he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. This wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Jones grew up in Atlanta, the child of professors \u2013 her father is a political scientist and her mother an economist; Jones remembers a childhood spent not eating grapes, <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/delano-grape-strike-united-farm-workers-filipinos\" title=\"\">in support of </a><a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/delano-grape-strike-united-farm-workers-filipinos\" title=\"\">farm workers in California</a>, and boycotting the products of apartheid South Africa. I ask how close the mall conversation felt to a reality she could recognise. In answer, she recalls an incident from her childhood, at a time when a serial killer was murdering young black boys, crimes that she used as the basis for her first novel, Leaving Atlanta. Two of the 28 murder victims went to her school. One night, her father was driving a family friend home and got lost. When he got back, he was shaken. \u201cHe said: \u2018I was just driving around those dark streets, I didn\u2019t know where I was going and I didn\u2019t have anyone to vouch for where I had been, and I was so afraid I would be pulled over.\u2019 It was the first time in my life I had seen my father afraid \u2026 and I now understand, he was just afraid that being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time could have ruined his life.\u201d</p> <p>Jones\u2019s UK visit has, of course, coincided with that of another American, Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s following me,\u201d she sighs. I ask whether she feels that the great regression sweeping her country \u2013 the rise of the far right, the rolling back of the rights of women and of minorities \u2013 feels like a threat to the fragile gains of civil rights activists. She points to what feels like an epidemic of the police being summoned to \u201cblack people doing ordinary things in ordinary places\u201d; she makes sure that when she arrives at a cafe, she orders coffee immediately, to signal that she is a patron rather than a trouble-maker or a vagrant. She has stopped looking at her neighbourhood website to which people upload their video doorbell footage because of the occasions on which neighbours would mark as suspicious the perfectly legitimate comings and goings of black people (including, she tells me, those canvassing for the Democrat politician Stacey Abrams). \u201cI am sometimes appalled,\u201d she says, \u201cat what my neighbours find to be suspicious.\u201d She is preoccupied now with what happens in a post-Trump world. \u201cLet\u2019s say Trump is not re-elected. Let\u2019s say all over the world, these far-right regimes are put down. How will we live with our neighbours, knowing what we now know of them?\u201d</p> <p>Jones now has a platform, but even a few years ago it was looking decidedly precarious. She couldn\u2019t find a publisher for her third novel, and her first two, well-received critically but not huge sellers, had fallen out of print. That third novel, Silver Sparrow, was firmly relegated to a drawer.

      "bodyText": "\u2018I\u2019m a person,\u201d says Tayari Jones, the morning after carrying off the Women\u2019s prize for fiction for her fourth novel, An American Marriage, \u201cwho before this had never even won a raffle. Truly. I remember, as a child, you could win a whole summer of ice-cream and I saved and I bought several tickets. I did not win and the little girl who won only had one ticket. How about that? I\u2019ve been holding that grudge for 40 years.\u201d An American Marriage, the story of a black man falsely imprisoned for a violent assault on a woman he glancingly meets in an Atlanta motel, has certainly transformed Jones\u2019s literary fortunes. Crucially, it caught the eye of Oprah Winfrey, who last year selected it for her Book Club \u2013 a guarantee of enormously enhanced sales and profile. Then came the moment when the former US president Barack Obama included it on his increasingly celebrated list of summer reading, praising its \u201cmoving portrayal of the effects of a wrongful conviction on a young African-American couple\u201d. It\u2019s easy to see what attracted Winfrey and Obama: the novel turns outwards to address the immense and seemingly intractable issues around the incarceration of black men, and at the same time never loses sight of the traumatic effects of injustice on its victims\u2019 most intimate relationships. As its title suggests, it\u2019s concerned not only with Roy, the young man from a working-class Atlanta family keen to grab all the opportunities life offers him, but with his wife, Celestial, an artist from a far more moneyed and socially elevated background. When I remark that two of the writers shortlisted for the Women\u2019s prize, Pat Barker and Madeline Miller, set their stories in ancient Greece, Jones points out that An American Marriage is itself in conversation with The Odyssey, the story of a man trying simply to get home to his wife; and of a wife who, left alone to hold the fort, is faced with the dilemma of how far to proceed with her own life. When people question Jones about the minutiae of the crime at the book\u2019s heart, she counters strongly: \u201cI don\u2019t want this to be a story about the police. I don\u2019t want this to be a story about law enforcement. This is not a procedural. This is the story about a family affected by wrongful conviction, about what they owe each other and the ways that they will move forward. I think that when we forget that part of stories, we are actually dismantling community.\u201d Which is not to say that Jones, 48, turns away from the stark political realities the novel is built on; she spent a year at Harvard doing research for the book and, even on this short trip to Britain, has found time to visit Brixton prison in south London, home to the inmate-run restaurant The Clink. The decision to write about imprisonment, she says, \u201cwasn\u2019t any big lightning bolt. I feel that the idea of incarceration has always been, in many ways, the boogie man under the bed for black America. There\u2019s a fear, particularly among the middle class, that you\u2019ll do everything right \u2013 you\u2019ll go to school, you\u2019ll do this, you\u2019ll do that \u2013 and then the system will just come and abduct you. That is the monster under the bed, and I wanted to look under the bed and face it head on.\u201d She says her concern spreads beyond clear miscarriages of justice to encompass the vast numbers of those in jail for non-violent drug offences, or who are mentally ill. \u201cI\u2019m not only interested in the \u2018innocent people\u2019; when we make that distinction between innocent and not innocent, we miss the major issues about prison reform.\u201d But while the horror thrown up by her research was stopping her from sleeping, it was not, she tells me, \u201cmoving my pen \u2026 I felt like I was trying to animate statistics\u201d. (She also recalls being advised to put more overt political content in the novel, \u201cas if I had some Black Lives Matter in my handbag\u201d.) Conscious of the advice that you should write fiction about people and their problems, not problems and their people, she one day found herself in a mall, tuning into a couple\u2019s argument. \u201cI heard the woman say: \u2018Roy, you know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u2019 And he said: \u2018I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. This wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place.\u2019\u201d Jones grew up in Atlanta, the child of professors \u2013 her father is a political scientist and her mother an economist; Jones remembers a childhood spent not eating grapes, in support of farm workers in California, and boycotting the products of apartheid South Africa. I ask how close the mall conversation felt to a reality she could recognise. In answer, she recalls an incident from her childhood, at a time when a serial killer was murdering young black boys, crimes that she used as the basis for her first novel, Leaving Atlanta. Two of the 28 murder victims went to her school. One night, her father was driving a family friend home and got lost. When he got back, he was shaken. \u201cHe said: \u2018I was just driving around those dark streets, I didn\u2019t know where I was going and I didn\u2019t have anyone to vouch for where I had been, and I was so afraid I would be pulled over.\u2019 It was the first time in my life I had seen my father afraid \u2026 and I now understand, he was just afraid that being a black man in the wrong place at the wrong time could have ruined his life.\u201d Jones\u2019s UK visit has, of course, coincided with that of another American, Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s following me,\u201d she sighs. I ask whether she feels that the great regression sweeping her country \u2013 the rise of the far right, the rolling back of the rights of women and of minorities \u2013 feels like a threat to the fragile gains of civil rights activists. She points to what feels like an epidemic of the police being summoned to \u201cblack people doing ordinary things in ordinary places\u201d; she makes sure that when she arrives at a cafe, she orders coffee immediately, to signal that she is a patron rather than a trouble-maker or a vagrant. She has stopped looking at her neighbourhood website to which people upload their video doorbell footage because of the occasions on which neighbours would mark as suspicious the perfectly legitimate comings and goings of black people (including, she tells me, those canvassing for the Democrat politician Stacey Abrams). \u201cI am sometimes appalled,\u201d she says, \u201cat what my neighbours find to be suspicious.\u201d She is preoccupied now with what happens in a post-Trump world. \u201cLet\u2019s say Trump is not re-elected. Let\u2019s say all over the world, these far-right regimes are put down. How will we live with our neighbours, knowing what we now know of them?\u201d Jones now has a platform, but even a few years ago it was looking decidedly precarious. She couldn\u2019t find a publisher for her third novel, and her first two, well-received critically but not huge sellers, had fallen out of print. That third novel, Silver Sparrow, was firmly relegated to a drawer. Invited to a book festival, she went out of obligation, but was feeling embarrassed \u2013 as though her lack of success disqualified her from being there. But while she was there, a woman said: \u201cI can help you.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t take it very seriously because you meet a lot of unusual people on the road with unusual ideas. But she literally put my hand in the hand of a publisher.\u201d They chatted, and before they said goodbye, the publisher asked her how she knew Judy.

      "bodyText": "When Extinction Rebellion activists shut down London in April, we sounded the alarm loud and clear about the climate and ecological crisis that threatens humanity\u2019s very survival. In response, around the world, governments, local councils, companies and professionals are stepping up and declaring a climate emergency. And yet, the silence from the major agents of climate destruction remains deafening. In the heart of London, the city that heard our rallying cry to \u201cAct as if the truth is real\u201d, BP, a global fossil fuel giant, is sponsoring the Royal Opera House Big Screen in Trafalgar Square. Rather than denouncing the damage these companies continue to do to our planet, our cultural institutions are lending them legitimacy. On Tuesday evening, Extinction Rebellion Lambeth and rebels from across London will protest before the Big Screen showing of Romeo and Juliet. Their own silent tragedy of Petroleo and Fueliet will highlight the pain and devastation caused to the silent masses and demand our leaders end complicity in climate breakdown. Oil majors have known what is at stake for a long time and have waged multimillion-dollar lobbying campaigns, spinning a web of deceit. Now is the time to expose how they use sponsorship of arts and cultural organisations to greenwash the truth about what they do. BP has made the third biggest contribution to climate change of any company in history. It is time to say: no more. Fossil fuels are the main drivers of the climate crisis, and as coal faces an investor exodus, new oil and gas infrastructure is a growing global threat. In the UK, we\u2019ve seen electricity generation become coal-free for more than a fortnight. This is great news; now the fight for clean energy in the UK must aim at stopping oil and gas expansion, and boosting solar, wind power, battery storage and other low-carbon technology. Further gas or oil exploration is incompatible with keeping global warming below the 1.5 degrees we need to mitigate the risk of societal collapse, mass migration and hunger. New oil exploration is utterly incompatible with preserving life on Earth. Nonetheless, BP plans to spend over $70bn in new gas and oil fields in the coming decade. A Greenpeace Unearthed investigation recently exposed how BP lobbied the Donald Trump administration for drilling rights in the protected Arctic national wildlife refuge, one of the last untouched ecosystems on Earth. This is despite the fact that the company is already responsible for 200,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from pipelines in Alaska in 2006 and the Deepwater Horizon tragedy in 2010. Governments and investors are belatedly waking up to high risk of oil and gas. Last year, New York City divested US$5bn. On Wednesday, the trillion-dollar Norwegian sovereign wealth fund will divest up to US$8bn from around 150 oil and gas exploration companies. BP and the oil majors might not be part of that exclusion list, yet, but the tide is turning. To act in accordance with the realities of climate breakdown, to stand in solidarity with the millions of people already feeling its catastrophic effects, to have any hope of turning the ship around in the small window of time we have left, we can no longer sanction the behaviour of the oil majors. By allowing them to share a platform with our respected cultural organisations we are complicit in the destruction they are wreaking on our planet. Sponsorship deals allow BP to promote itself as a philanthropic organisation and a responsible player in society, maintaining its social licence to operate, while deflecting attention from its destructive impacts on communities and national economies. In April, Extinction Rebellion targeted Shell\u2019s London headquarters. Now it is the turn of BP. In what looks set to be the largest protest against oil sponsorship to date, Extinction Rebellion Lambeth is joining the art-not-oil movement in calling for our cultural institutions to sever their ties with big oil. In February, hundreds of activists occupied the British Museum to protest against its relationship with the oil giant, and today one of the judges of the prestigious Portrait Awards has spoken out and demanded the National Portrait Gallery remove BP sponsorship. The environmental movement is coming together and the pressure is relentless; society will no longer normalise the actions of the oil majors. BP used to be a British state-owned company, and it extends our emissions around the world.

Communication with Williams needs to improve. 5 Steph Catley Classy, constant overlaps up the left flank, and consistent precision passes. 7 Emily van Egmond Started nervously with a series of rushed passes, but showed discipline to pivot back to Williams regularly and stretch the Italian attack. 5 Hayley Raso Was slow to start, but turned up the heat through her energetic injection later in the first half. 7 Caitlin Foord Solid without setting the game alight. Combined well with Carpenter at times. 7 Tameka Yallop Worked hard off the ball but her creatively was stifled through a series of heavy challenges by the Italians. 5 Chloe Logarzo Spirited outing, combining well down the left with Catley to feed the forward line, and was on the end of a few well-weighted crosses but wasn\u2019t able to find the back of the net. 6 Sam Kerr (captain) Nervous start, complete with a missed penalty, but joyously converted the rebound for her first World Cup goal.

      "bodyText": "A Labour MP will be rebuked by the party\u2019s chief whip for telling campaigners they are right to protest against LGBT teaching at a Birmingham primary school. Roger Godsiff, the MP for the city\u2019s Hall Green constituency, which includes Anderton Park Primary school, also told protesters they had a \u201cjust cause\u201d and criticised the headteacher. The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said she had reported the \u201cdiscriminatory and irresponsible\u201d comments to the chief whip, Nick Brown, as Godsiff was criticised by a number of Labour MPs. A Labour spokesman said the party had long supported and campaigned for LGBT-inclusive education in schools and there was \u201cno justifiable reason\u201d to stop teaching about such topics. \u201cRoger Godsiff will be spoken to by the chief whip and reminded of his responsibilities as an MP,\u201d he said. Parents have staged weeks of protests outside the school against the teaching of LGBT rights, claiming the lessons were \u201coveremphasising a gay ethos\u201d and contradicting Islam. The demonstrations, which were described last week as \u201chomophobic\u201d by the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, led the council to apply for a high court interim injunction, which banned rallies outside the gates from Friday. Godsiff, who has previously said the equality lessons were not \u201cage appropriate\u201d, was seen telling protesters they were right in a video that emerged this weekend. The veteran MP, who is seen with Shakeel Afsar, the lead organiser of the protests, said: \u201cI think you have a just cause and I regret the fact that it hasn\u2019t been reciprocated by the headteacher.\u201d He asked demonstrators toconsider calling off the protest as he said they had made their point, but added that it would be their choice to do so. He then said: \u201cI will continue to try and fight your corner, because you\u2019re right. Nothing more, nothing less.

This is a huge moment for the Matildas. With each World Cup, the pool of nations who could conceivably win the tournament gets larger. While certainly no heroes when it comes to investing in women\u2019s sport, Australia have been ahead of many other countries in this area due to a strong sporting culture across the board. But as women\u2019s sport becomes more financially interesting to countries who are strong in the men\u2019s game, we will no doubt see more and more teams rise up. This is a major reason why there\u2019s a bit of a feeling of \u2018now or never\u2019 for the Matildas.

      "bodyText": "And with that, this liveblog draws to a close. Thanks for joining me. I\u2019ll be in Montpellier on Thursday when Australia take on Brazil. Until then! More reaction from Milicic: Yes it\u2019s a work in progress \u2013 but that\u2019s no excuse. Today was all about getting points from the game. Here\u2019s Richard Parkin\u2019s first take from Valenciennes: Eric writes in, rather unhappy with the Australian performance. The gist of his comments are as follows: Australia cannot win the World Cup. Matildas boss Ante Milicic speaks in the post-match press conference: There\u2019s still two games to go. We need to regroup quickly and learn from the mistakes. To lose the game that late in the piece \u2013 I don\u2019t think we deserved that. The Italians, meanwhile, will be delighted with that shock victory. Returning to this grand stage for the first time in two decades, Italy were resolute in their defence and took the opportunities that fell for them. A brave performance which was rewarded with maximum points. A very poor start to the 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup for the Matildas. Not quite disastrous - and given the better third-placed teams qualify for the next round, there is still a long way to go and cause for optimism. But Australia now need to beat Brazil on Thursday to retain hope of topping Group C. And that won\u2019t be easy. Australian fans won\u2019t like that ending, but you can\u2019t deny it was entertaining. Mike from Canada writes in: Methinks that the much-lauded Matildas underestimated Italy which played as if rankings didn\u2019t matter ... and they don\u2019t. Australian coach Ante Milicic does not look happy on the touch-line. This was supposed - supposed - to be an soft opener to the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup for Australia. Sure, Italy were not going to be easy, and the Matildas said all the right things about respecting the opposition. But they weren\u2019t expecting that. Full-time: A last gasp Australian attempt did not amount to anything and the Italians have secured a surprise win in Valenciennes. 90+5 min: GOALLLLLLLLLLLL. Bonansea is the woman of the moment. She nods in from the free-kick to take the advantage for the Italians. Mamma mia! 90+3 min: Italy take the ball to the Australian corner for some time wasting, and win themselves a dangerous free-kick in the process. 90+2 min: The free-kick is punched out by Giuliani, who has had an excellent stint between the Italian sticks. 90+1 min: Foord wins a free-kick on the left-hand side of the Italian box. Could this be Australia\u2019s last chance? 90 min: Five minutes of injury time. Can either side find the winner? On current form, it doesn\u2019t look likely 88 min: A Catley error almost gifts Italy the winner, but a good save from Williams and - you\u2019d never guess - ANOTHER offside call saves the day. 88 min: The action is getting rather scrappy as both teams search for a winner. Australia have more momentum, but it isn\u2019t amounting to anything just yet. Some Italian thoughts on the offside officiating. 84 min: The Italian danger woman Bonansea receives the ball and charges towards Australian custodian Williams. She\u2019s intercepted by a Matildas\u2019 defender, but - again - called offside. 82 min: Yallop off for Australia, replaced by Kellond-Knight. Can KK make a late impact for the Matildas? That\u2019s two Italian goals chalked off for offside today. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t need me to tell them that they might want to work on that... 80 min: Goal Italy? Sabatino converts after her shot attempt first hits the upright and bounces back, but it is ruled offside - again. 79 min: Italy piling on the pressure, forcing a dangerous backpass from Kennedy to Williams - although, again, the Italian move is subsequently ruled offside. Attendance in Valenciennes today: 15,380. That\u2019s not too far shy of its maximum capacity of about 25,000. 76 min: Sub De Vanna is making an impact, if not the one hoped - she\u2019s picked up a yellow card. Italy have also made a sub: Bergamaschi is replaced by Giacinti. 75 min: The Matildas are looking very flat. Perhaps they didn\u2019t expect such a test from the Italians, appearing at their first Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup in two decades. It\u2019s fair to say that Italy have the upper-hand right now. They\u2019ve been creating space on both flanks, while the Australians have been largely quiet. 70 min: Italy go on a marauding run with Bergamaschi, who knocks it into the hands of Williams - but it is called back for offside. The Matildas are living dangerously. Kerr has been surprisingly quiet this game. True, she converted her saved penalty, but otherwise hasn\u2019t shown her usual dynamism. Is the pressure of the big stage getting to her? 68 min: Raso off for Gorry for the Aussies. It almost rhymes... Australian fans putting their faith in the impact sub. Cometh the hour, cometh Lisa De Vanna? From long-time Matildas fan Kevin Flood: De Vanna will change this for the Aussies. The veteran will make the difference. 64 min: Corner Australia and Kennedy gets her head to it, but it nods just wide. OB Jato has certainly changed his/her/their tune: Did I mention Italy have been pretty good too 60 min: Australia reply with a sub of their own - Logarzo off for De Vanna. If the current action isn\u2019t sufficiently captivating, Parkin had a lovely chat with the mercurial veteran recently which you can read below. 59 min: Italy almost take the lead! Chaos in the Matildas back-line. This has been quite the turn-around. 58 min: Italy make their first subsitution, Mauro off for AC Milan forward Sabatino. 55 min: Italy equalise! Well, that\u2019s a change isn\u2019t it? Just as the Matildas were looking comfortable, a defensive howler from Clare Polkinghorne saw Bonansea collect on the corner of the box, waltz towards goal and calmly finish past Williams. Oh dear. 53 min: Double opportunity for Australia has Italian custodian Giuliani scrabbling, but they amount to nothing. 51 min: The Australian supporter\u2019s section next to me have started a Mexican wave. Can we please ban these until at least the 80th minute? Please, have some decorum! Noted tactical expert Richard Parkin (sitting next to me) had this to say, in between frantically working on his match report: Australia are overloading the right side channel - Carpenter and Raso are having a field day against the Italian left-back. The Matildas just need to hold tight and the three points are in reach, but Girelli is looking dangerous - she\u2019s the one to watch for Italy. 48 min: Corner to Italy. Giugliano swings it in and Williams has to bat away. The Matildas quickly counter and it\u2019s down field we go. OB Jato writes in again. With the title \u2018My thoughts on the first 45 minutes of Matildas\u2019 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup campaign\u2019, I\u2019m expecting a lengthy missive. Instead: They\u2019re bloody good. 46 min: Peep! We\u2019re back on in Valenciennes. Can the Matildas add to their advantage? Or is the fight-back on? Let\u2019s find out. So, dear reader, what are your thoughts on the first 45 minutes of the Matildas\u2019 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup campaign? Let me know: email or tweet @KieranPender. There\u2019s a lot of love on social media for Ellie Carpenter, Australia\u2019s teenage defensive sensation. She has been causing Italy all sorts of headaches on the flank. Tweet of the day, which I can now no longer locate: \u2018Can she play for the Socceroos, too?\u2019 Well. Italy started strongly, but had their momentum dented with that penalty - which was saved but bounced back into the path of Sam Kerr for her first-ever World Cup goal. Australia have had 57% of possession and have, on balance, been the better team across the first 45 - but they are a long way from leaving with all three points. Give me a moment to compose myself and I\u2019ll be back with the second-half shortly. 45+2 min: Referee Borjas brings an end to the first half of proceedings. 45 min: As half-time draws near, Foord switches right to Raso - who lofts in a cross but Kerr is blocked by an Italian defender and Giuliani grasps the ball. Someone has been taking goal celebration lessons from the one and only... 42 min: This time the Matildas come at Italy from the left via Logarzo, but again their penetration does not lead to a goal-scoring chance. 40 min: Australia are creating a lot of space and embarking on some nice mazy runs, but failing to convert this creativity into clear opportunities. The Italians are still very much in this game. 37 min: Logarzo\u2019s head connects to a beautiful Matildas\u2019 cross, but it bounces out for an Australian corner - which comes to nothing. 34 min: Italy\u2019s captain Gama was yellow-carded for the effort that led to the penalty, which could cause the Italians headaches. She\u2019s the defensive lynchpin for both Juventus and the national team, and will now have to check herself in tackles for the hour remaining. 31 min: A big roar from the crowd as Williams picks herself off the ground and continues on. The 1,500-odd Australians in Valenciennes are certainly making themselves heard. 30 min: Excellent goalkeeping from Lydia Williams, to deny a close-range shot from Girelli - although the Australian keeper has injured herself in the process. How\u2019s this for an iconic shot? 27 min: Carpenter again causing havoc on the right. Just 19, she\u2019s the youngest member of this Australian starting XI and is making a big impact. 25 min: Carpenter dashes down the inside right channel and slides the ball through to Kerr, whose shot is deflected out for a corner. 22 min: Well, that should certainly settle the Australian nerves. The Italians had been resisting well and created a number of chances (including that disallowed goal). But the clear penalty has handed the advantage and the momentum to the Matildas. 21 min: Kerr converts! 1-0 Australia. Only just - Guiliani gets a hand to the spot-kick, but it rebounds and Kerr fires home. That\u2019s her first-ever goal in a Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. 20 min: Italian captain Gama knocks down Sam Kerr in the box and the Honduran referee wastes no time pointing to the spot. 19 min: Catley fires it in, and the ball rebounds out to van Egmond - who shoots and is centimetres away from finding Hayley Raso. That\u2019s Australia\u2019s best chance of the match so far. 18 min: Australia win a free-kick in the Italian right-hand corner. Dangerous areas... Reader David Hancock does not agree with my love of the Matildas\u2019 kit: It\u2019s awful. It looks especially sickly up against the stylish Italy kit. It\u2019s as if the designer got one of their kids to draw the pattern 16 min: Some tactical insight from colleague Richard Parkin, sitting next to me. The Italians are playing a narrow three in the midfield, which means there is space for the Australian full-backs. Steph Catley and Sam Kerr are combining well, and that could be a danger area for Italy. 14 min: Alia Guagni picks up a pass on the edge of the Matildas box and has a punt, but her shot flies well-wide of Australian custodian Lydia Williams. 13 min: This has been an exciting, end-to-end encounter so far. Italy mean business and any hopes that their two decade absence from the Women\u2019s World Cup would dent their return have so far proved unfounded. To paraphase the Australian Prime Minister: \u2018How good is football?!\u2019 9 min: Italy score! But it\u2019s off-side. Bonansea collects a scything ball through the midfield and has acres of space. It is disallowed by the assistant and is referred to VAR. The replay shows Bonansea was perhaps a milimetre offside - but no benefit of the doubt this time, with VAR - eventually - holding for Australia. Rachel here reflecting the views of just about every Australian right now. Kerr has been quiet in the first eight minutes, but it\u2019s unlikely to be too long until she starts troubling the Italian defence. 6 min: Caitlin Foord is finding plenty of space in the attacking third for Australia, but struggling to connect with her team-mates on that final pass. 5 min: The Matildas have had the better of the early exchanges, with a couple of half-chances. But they certainly aren\u2019t dominating and the Italians have already produced some movement through the midfield. Good spot from AAP scribe Ben McKay. Let\u2019s hope... 1 min: We\u2019re underway! And the Italians are already on the attack, with a foraging run down the left flank. I suspect we\u2019ll be seeing a lot of this today. Or more accurately, we won\u2019t be seeing Sam Kerr as she speeds past the Italian defence. The Italian anthem is a very upbeat affair, it must be said. Now just the usual formalities to go and we will be underway, for the opening match of group C of the 2019 Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup. The players are walking out now. The Stade du Hainaut is perhaps three-quarters full and the atmosphere is very positive. \u2018Advance Australia Fair\u2019 now belting out. We\u2019ve had a reader write in to offer a contrarian prediction. OB Jato says: \u2018Something tells me it could be a 1-1 draw!\u2019 Do email me your missives or get on-board the Twitter action: @KieranPender The stadium management are cycling through the usual Fifa playlist. Which means AC/DC is getting a work-out. \u2018You\u2019ve been Thunderstruckkkkkk\u2019 etc and so on. Standing by for the White Stripes\u2019 Seven Nation Army, which signals that things are about to get going. The Guardian\u2019s Australian panel of experts have convened and given their verdicts on today\u2019s match. Richard Parkin was originally tipping a draw, then saw the Italian shooting in warm-up and changed his mind. Editor Mike Hytner refused to be drawn: \u201cPredictions are a mug\u2019s game. You\u2019ll not get one out of me\u201d. No-one is tipping Italy, but then again, as we saw at election time, the polls are always wrong. Megan Maurice: 2-1 Matildas Richard Parkin: 2-0 Matildas Kieran Pender: 2-1 Matildas In one of those \u2018only Fifa\u2019 things, late Matildas call-up Karly Roestbakken had her name spelled incorrectly (\u2018Roestabakken\u2019) on the version of the team-list approved by Fifa and they are apparently not able to change it until the next match... With 25 minutes to kick off, the stadium is beginning to fill up nicely. As of yesterday, 16,500 tickets had been sold. 1,256 supporters were identifiable as Australian fans and 850 as Italy supporters. Given it is a two hour flight from Italy and a 24 hour flight from Australia, the green and gold army can claim that as a comprehensive moral victory for Australia. The Matildas also seem to be the neutral favourite in Valenciennes \u2013 at least that\u2019s what I think the locals were saying in the bakery this morning, but then again, je ne parle pas fran\u00e7ais. And for those of you who prefer your line-up information in visual form: The teams are in, and Ante Milicic is fielding a Matildas side unchanged from that which lost to Holland in their only pre-tournament friendly. Italy, meanwhile, have opted for an attacking 4-3-3 formation. As a side note - six of the 11 starters for Italy have surnames beginning with \u2018G\u2019. Australia: Williams, Polkinghorne, Logarzo, Catley, Foord, Van Egmond, Yallop, Kennedy, Raso, Kerr, Carpenter Italy: Giuliani, Bergamasch, Gama, Galli, Linari, Guagni, Girelli, Bonansea, Mauro, Cernoia, Giugliano The Matildas and Italy are both on the pitch warming up. Can we just take a moment to appreciate how great the Australian kit is? Bonjour! Hello and welcome from the lovely Stade du Hainaut in Valenciennes - Kieran Pender reporting for duty. It is a nice day in northern France \u2013 the sun was shining until a moment ago, and the temperature is just right for a great match of football. I will be your live blog host for today, from live in the stadium. I\u2019ll level with you: this is the first time I have live blogged live, so to speak \u2013 the magic normally happens from behind a screen with the benefit of television replays. The Guardian \u2013 always innovating! So feel free to send me your thoughts, and I will endeavor to bring you a sense of the atmosphere in the stadium. And with that I hand you over to Kieran Pender on the ground in France who will take you through the pre-match and all the action of tonight\u2019s game. Thanks for hanging out with me as we get hyped up together. I leave you in Kieran\u2019s capable hands as I get into fan mode. Enjoy the game! Stepping away from tonight\u2019s game for a moment, we ran a fascinating interview with USA back Crystal Dunn on the struggles she faces as a black woman in a sport dominated by the white middle class in her home country. With the US as one of the tournament favourites, she is sure to be an influential player in this World Cup. And of course, don\u2019t miss our guide to the Matildas, where Richard Parkin predicts that Ellie Carpenter will be the surprise packet of the World Cup. Keep an eye on the teenage sensation tonight, Parkin describes her as \u201ctenacious, hard-working, with pace and an engine that goes all day.\u201d If you\u2019re interesting in scoping out the opposition, head on over to our Experts\u2019 Network team guide to Italy. Lots of great information in this one, including the fact that captain Sara Gama was made into a Barbie doll as part of a role models campaign! It was also great to see what Guardian readers from around the world are predicting for the tournament. There is so much hope, positivity and passion in here - a beautiful reflection of what the World Cup means to football fans. While we\u2019re on the subject, Kieran Pender (who is going to take you through tonight\u2019s game) had a great article earlier this week on the role of Fifa in this tournament and how their promotion - or lack thereof - will affect the players and fans. Former Matildas player Joey Peters has summed up the situation wonderfully with her article this week explaining how the Women\u2019s World Cup can be a platform for change. Although women\u2019s football has come a long way, there is still so far to go and this tournament has the ability to spark lasting change for women all over the world. If you\u2019re just hopping on the Matildas bandwagon, welcome aboard! There\u2019s no judgement here and the more fans the merrier when a World Cup is at stake. If you\u2019re new to football and you\u2019re not quite sure how it all works, we\u2019ve got you covered with all the essential questions answered here: Not much hope for the Matildas\u2019 chances in our football writers\u2019 predictions this week. However Australians love an underdog and if they manage to come away with a win it will make victory even sweeter. In good news, both Caitlin Murray and Kieran Pender have tipped Sam Kerr to be the top scorer for the tournament. Sam Kerr meanwhile, may never have made it to a World Cup if she\u2019d been born in a different era. As an AFL-mad kid, she would certainly have been chasing a spot in the AFLW had it been around when she was younger. Instead she switched to football and by her own admission was \u201ctotal crap\u201d when she first began. From there to Ballon d\u2019Or nominee, this is a fascinating look at what drives Kerr on. Lisa de Vanna has had quite a career with the Matildas. The 34-year-old has been twice removed from the Matildas set up for behavioural issues throughout her career and has never been afraid to speak her mind. It\u2019s refreshing to hear her honesty as she approaches the latter stages of her career and see how she has matured over the years. Let\u2019s set the scene while we wait for the action to begin. This is a huge moment for the Matildas. With each World Cup, the pool of nations who could conceivably win the tournament gets larger. While certainly no heroes when it comes to investing in women\u2019s sport, Australia have been ahead of many other countries in this area due to a strong sporting culture across the board. But as women\u2019s sport becomes more financially interesting to countries who are strong in the men\u2019s game, we will no doubt see more and more teams rise up. This is a major reason why there\u2019s a bit of a feeling of \u2018now or never\u2019 for the Matildas. Richard Parkin covers it off beautifully in his article from this morning. While pay disputes feature heavily in this year\u2019s tournament, with huge disparities between the men\u2019s and women\u2019s World Cups, it\u2019s certainly interesting to look back and see how far we\u2019ve come. Louise Taylor\u2019s fascinating article on the history of the Women\u2019s World Cup tells the story of a team of English rebels who defied authorities to participate in an unofficial World Cup in Mexico in 1971. Unfortunately we must start with some bad news for the Matildas with experienced defender Laura Alleway ruled out of today\u2019s game with a suspected fracture to her foot. The veteran of two World Cups was in fantastic form leading in and could have pushed for a starting spot. Well the moment has finally arrived! After patiently waiting through the first two days of competition, Matildas fans finally get the chance to see their team in action. It\u2019s unlikely to be an easy match for the Australians, coming up against Italy who are currently ranked 15th in the world. While the Matildas are comfortably ahead with their world number 6 ranking, Italy have had some strong results lately with comfortable wins over Hungary and Thailand in March. It\u2019s sure to be a big one, so stay with me as I take you through the build up, then hand over to our intrepid reporter Kieran Pender for the pre-match and the game itself.",

If you don\u2019t share those values then anyone is free to leave this country if they don\u2019t agree.\u201d He received death threats following his comments, and his private address was published on the far-right blog PI News. Footage of his remarkswas reshared by rightwing bloggers in February this year. Far-right accounts on social media celebrated L\u00fcbcke\u2019s death in the days after the news emerged, drawing condemnation from across the political spectrum. \u201cIf someone is so hated, just because he had liberal views, that is the decline of human morality,\u201d Germany\u2019s interior minister, Horst Seehofer, told the newspaper Tagesspiegel. Detectives on the case say they have found no evidence of a political dimension to the killing. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 to clarify that the man was arrested after police analysed data on L\u00fcbcke\u2019s mobile phone.",

The national police force said the investigation began after a tip-off to its people-trafficking hotline. When officers went to the house on the Costa del Sol they found it was being run as a 24-hour brothel with a bar. They freed the eight women and arrested 21 alleged members of a gang led by a Portuguese family. \u201cThe investigation found that the women were recruited in Spain,\u201d the force said. \u201cSome of them voluntarily sought work at the brothel while others were tricked with offers of work in a \u2018massage parlour\u2019. Once there they were subjected to a system of fines, exhausting days and threats.\u201d Police also discovered that the women were forbidden to leave the basement, and that the gang supplied cocaine and MDMA to its customers. \u201cFifty-five grams of MDMA were recovered, along with 5g cocaine, 17 small bags of hashish, 190g of Kamagra, \u20ac1,000 in cash, four fake \u20ac100 notes, a large number of knives, computers, mobile phones and documents suggesting criminal activity,\u201d the force said.

Then, things start to take a turn for the worse. The inflow of foreign capital leads to a stronger currency, which makes imports cheaper but exports dearer. The economy starts to overheat and the balance of payments deteriorates. Without preventative action, foreign investors will head straight for the exit, leading to a collapsing currency and the prospect of an appeal to the International Monetary Fund for help.</p> <p>Slapping on capital controls has its attractions, but as will almost certainly be the case with Woodford, it is far too late. Why? Because preventing investors from getting access to their money simply demonstrates just how big a hole you are in. Panic results.</p> <p>But if the crisis of 2008 proved one thing it was that in extremis the unthinkable becomes the doable. And after the second world war capital controls were integral to achieving the main domestic policy \u2013 keeping people in work. Governments thought they could allow free movement of capital or full employment \u2013 but not both.</p> <p>Attitudes changed during the free-market revolution of the 1970s and early 1980s. Finance was liberalised, barriers to capital were torn down. The first big economic decision Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government made after the 1979 election was to remove foreign exchange controls. A lack of curbs on investment flows became one of the central pillars of globalisation. The IMF advice to emerging market economies was that free movement of capital was good, controls were bad. Governments could protect themselves from financial turbulence by keeping inflation, budget deficits and public debt low; by having a flexible exchange rate; and by having deep capital markets that avoided the need to rely on foreign investment.</p> <p>Clearly, though, abiding by the central tenets of the Washington-consensus has not been sufficient to prevent crises. Last week, <a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2019/mark-carney-keynote-remarks-at-the-2019-institute-of-international-finance-spring-membership-meeting\">Mark Carney </a>provided two reasons why that is.</p> <p>The first is that emerging economies \u2013 headed by China and India \u2013 now make up a much bigger proportion of the global economy, about 60% of total gross domestic product. But the profound shift in the economic balance of power over the past 30 years or so has not been matched by a reordering of the global monetary system.</p> <p>As Carney noted, the dollar represents the currency of choice for at least half of international trade invoices and two-thirds of global securities issuance. Two-thirds of the external foreign debts of emerging economies are denominated in dollars, and the US currency acts as the monetary anchor in countries accounting for 70% of world GDP.</p> <p>This means that changes to US economic policy \u2013 especially interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve \u2013 have a disproportionate impact on global economic and financial conditions. The Bank of England estimates that the influence of US financial conditions on foreign GDP has increased by a third relative to its average from 1990 to 2005 even though the US accounts for a much smaller share of the world economy. So, no matter whether they keep inflation low and display rigid budgetary discipline, emerging countries can find themselves in real trouble when the US raises interest rates.</p> <p>The second reason is that the structure of the global financial system lends itself to crises. For a start, emerging market countries know they are vulnerable to sudden capital flight. Their response has been to amass huge reserves in safe assets to fend off attacks on their currencies. There has been a glut of saving, which has helped drive down global interest rates.</p> <p>This leaves investors with a choice. They can keep their money in advanced countries and accept low returns or they can look to the emerging markets where the risks and the rewards are higher.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the financial crisis, supervision of banks has been tightened up so they have to hold more capital against potential losses.

      "bodyText": "The military regime in Sudan has launched a new wave of arrests and violent intimidation in an effort to undermine opposition plans for a widespread campaign of civil disobedience. Pro-reform groups warned of a \u201cfrenzied campaign launched by the military junta to arrest political activists and revolutionaries\u201d ahead of a general strike that started on Sunday. Professionals, including bankers, doctors, air traffic control staff, pilots, electrical engineers and economists, have been targeted by intelligence services in what the Sudanese Professionals Association, one of the main opposition groups, said was an \u201cobvious attempt\u201d to break the strike. \u201cIn the face of these repressive developments, we call upon the workers in the private and public sectors to strictly adhere to the [campaign] of civil disobedience and the general strike. These peaceful means are a way to cherish the blood of the martyrs [and] protect the lives of colleagues,\u201d the group said in a statement. More than 120 people died and hundreds were injured when paramilitaries attacked a protest camp in the centre of Khartoum on Monday. Activists say that the total number of people detained by security services in recent days is unclear, but is \u201cprobably in the hundreds\u201d. There were reports of sporadic violence on Sunday morning as shops, banks, offices and businesses shut on the first day of the civil disobedience. Two deaths were reported in the Khartoum district of Bahri after a shooting. In the neighbouring city of Omdurman, roads are blocked by makeshift barricades. Though security forced appeared to have been withdrawn from some of the streets, tensions remained among fears of further attacks. Two opposition leaders who met the Ethiopian prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, in Khartoum on Friday have been detained, along with an opposition spokesman. But scores more arrests and detentions have gone unreported, opposition groups in Khartoum say. Abiy was in the Sudanese capital to mediate between the opposition and the ruling Transitional Military Council (TMC), which seized power when the dictator Omar al-Bashir was ousted in April after months of mass protests. Talks between the opposition Declaration of Freedom and Change Forces (DFCF) alliance and the TMC, over who will lead a transition period before elections, had ground to a halt, then collapsed altogether after the raid on the protest camp. \u201cThe problem is that the figurehead of the regime was removed but the regime remained in place. There are elements that haven\u2019t understood that; they can\u2019t rule in the same ways as before, given the breadth and depth of the protest movement,\u201d said Murithi Mutiga, an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Nairobi. The deaths on Monday have been blamed on the pramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which is largely made up of militias accused of systematic human rights abuses during the war in Darfur. The force is led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who also serves as the deputy head of the TMC. Witnesses to Monday\u2019s violence told the Observer that many protesters drowned after jumping into the Nile when the RSF charged through the camp, shooting and beating unarmed civilians. An association of medical professionals in Khartoum said that the RSF had retrieved 40 corpses from the river and taken them to be disposed of elsewhere. Other bodies were later found by residents and activists. Many had been attached to heavy concrete blocks in an apparent effort to sink them. Mohamed, a protester, said he saw about 50 people jumping from the famous Blue Nile bridge. \u201cThere was gunfire at the same time. Some of [the RSF] also carried some bodies and threw them into the Nile, just to open the bridge and let the other forces come,\u201d he told the Observer. Ahmed, a 40-year-old father of three, said that he had responded to a call from protest organisers to gather at the sit-in site when it became clear that security forces were preparing to attack. \u201cThe RSF shot at me and I was hit in the arm,\u201d Ahmed said. \u201cI was taken to the clinic, but while I was there getting the treatment, the RSF came and they searched my phone and me, even though I was injured.

      "bodyText": "The Conservative leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt has claimed Angela Merkel would be willing to renegotiate the UK\u2019s Brexit deal and possibly the Irish border arrangements opposed by Eurosceptics. The foreign secretary said he had spoken to the German chancellor on the sidelines of D-day commemorations last week and she had indicated that the EU was \u201cwilling to negotiate on the package\u201d if a new prime minister had the \u201cright approach\u201d. His claim flies in the face of repeated assertions from Brussels that the withdrawal agreement cannot be reopened to change the Irish backstop, which Eurosceptics reject because they fear it may keep the UK in a customs union indefinitely. Speaking to Sky\u2019s Ridge on Sunday programme, Hunt said Merkel had told him Brussels \u201cwould look at any solutions\u201d the UK put forward to solve the Irish border issue. In apparent criticism of the leadership frontrunner, Boris Johnson, Hunt said an \u201cultra hardline person\u201d would be met by \u201can ultra-hardline response\u201d from the EU. Johnson told the Sunday Times he would withhold the UK\u2019s payments to the EU until a better deal could be struck. He suggested the settlement of \u00a339bn over the coming decades would be paid only when there was \u201cgreater clarity\u201d about the way forward. \u201cI always thought it was extraordinary that we should agree to write the entire cheque before having a final deal,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIn getting a good deal, money is a great solvent and a great lubricant.\u201d Johnson\u2019s claim that he would play hardball with the EU over money appears to have won him a string of new Eurosceptic backers, including Steve Baker, Priti Patel, Chris Grayling, James Cleverly and Owen Paterson. At the same time he has convinced a growing number of Tory moderates to support him, including the former minister Chloe Smith and James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, who is a close ally of Theresa May.

There\u2019ll be bike tours, both guided and non-guided, that take in the best restaurants; races for all levels of ability over 38km, 66km and 100km routes (plus kids\u2019 races); and evening events including barbecues, concerts and the chance to meet professional ebike riders. Julien Hess, managing director of the festival, says the resort was inspired to hold the event by the growth in the number of ebikers and the demand for summer events in Verbier. \u201cWe expect the festival to attract visitors who come here to ski and now want to experience the area in summer, and to mountain bikers and cyclists of all ages and experience\u201d. Hess sees ebiking as adding another string to the bow of resorts such as Verbier, giving them the opportunity to increase the number of summer visitors, allowing those visitors to rediscover the area without its winter snows, as well as giving pretty much everyone the chance to ride a bike in the mountains. \u201cEbikes also allow people with limited fitness or disabilities to enjoy cycling in the spectacular surroundings of the Alps, as well as helping in the battle against sedentary lifestyles.\u201d As for the hair shirt brigade who claim ebiking is cheating, he simply says: \u201cCome and give it a try and then we can talk again! And if you\u2019ve already given it a go and are still not convinced, I\u2019ll find you a challenge with an ebike that will make you change your mind \u2026\u201d \u2022 The Verbier Ebike Festival runs from 15-18 August. Ebike rental costs 30 Swiss francs a day (\u00a323); a full day of guided riding costs \u00a330.

Those were Michael Palin\u2019s favourite subjects \u2013 broadly defined \u2013 at school, and they\u2019re the threads connecting what might otherwise look like a crazily paved career. That\u2019s the argument, tenuous at times, of this solo show, in which the ex-Python delivers a fascinating precis of his 2018 naval history book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/30/erebus-story-of-a-ship-review-michael-palin\">Erebus</a>, and a whistle-stop tour of the preceding six decades of his professional life.</p> <p>It is as entertaining an evening as you\u2019d expect from telly\u2019s Mr Congeniality, although the seriousness of the history lecture might surprise those who stumped up without reading the small print. Palin spends on hour tracing the journeys of HMS Erebus to Antarctica and back, then on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/12/hms-terror-wreck-found-arctic-nearly-170-years-northwest-passage-attempt\">its doomed mission to navigate the Northwest Passage</a>. There are slides \u2013 maps, daguerreotypes of the protagonists, snaps of Palin\u2019s travels \u2013 and touching quotes from sailors\u2019 letters home. His book is available \u201cat all good bookshops,\u201d says Palin \u2013 though one might doubt, come the interval, whether there\u2019s much about Erebus left to learn.</p> <p>The second half recounts Palin\u2019s prior career, from boarding school to Oxford to having petals strewn at his feet by film and TV\u2019s powers that be. I exaggerate, but only slightly. His has been a gilded life, a fact sportingly acknowledged with reference to a spoof award he once received from Private Eye. We\u2019re led from Goon Show fandom via university friendship with Terry Jones to his writing break on The Frost Report. Then comes Monty Python: he reads out a prim list of cuts to Holy Grail proposed by the censor, and scenes that never made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/16/how-we-made-monty-python-life-of-brian-michael-palin-terry-gilliam\">Life of Brian</a>\u2019s final script.</p> <p>Save a brief update on Jones\u2019 health (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/16/monty-python-terry-jones-learning-to-live-with-dementia\">he was diagnosed with dementia in 2015</a>), there are few insights, intimacies or gossip. There\u2019s barely time: an hour on stage can\u2019t do justice to a 55-year career. Certainly, the inner Michael \u2013 assuming there is one beneath the courtly and affable veneer \u2013 remains as obscure as the wreck of the Erebus these last 150 years. But if the show only skims the surface, this compendium of clips, anecdotes \u2013 and a closing Lumberjack Song singalong \u2013 is delivered with characteristic humour and good grace.</p> <p>\u2022 At the <a href=\"https://www.cambridgelive.org.uk/cornex/events/michael-palin-live-stage-erebus-python-and-other-stories\">Cambridge Corn Exchange</a> on 9 June. <a href=\"https://www.themichaelpalin.com/tour-2019/\">Then touring until 7 July</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Geography, history and comedy. Those were Michael Palin\u2019s favourite subjects \u2013 broadly defined \u2013 at school, and they\u2019re the threads connecting what might otherwise look like a crazily paved career. That\u2019s the argument, tenuous at times, of this solo show, in which the ex-Python delivers a fascinating precis of his 2018 naval history book, Erebus, and a whistle-stop tour of the preceding six decades of his professional life. It is as entertaining an evening as you\u2019d expect from telly\u2019s Mr Congeniality, although the seriousness of the history lecture might surprise those who stumped up without reading the small print. Palin spends on hour tracing the journeys of HMS Erebus to Antarctica and back, then on its doomed mission to navigate the Northwest Passage. There are slides \u2013 maps, daguerreotypes of the protagonists, snaps of Palin\u2019s travels \u2013 and touching quotes from sailors\u2019 letters home. His book is available \u201cat all good bookshops,\u201d says Palin \u2013 though one might doubt, come the interval, whether there\u2019s much about Erebus left to learn. The second half recounts Palin\u2019s prior career, from boarding school to Oxford to having petals strewn at his feet by film and TV\u2019s powers that be. I exaggerate, but only slightly. His has been a gilded life, a fact sportingly acknowledged with reference to a spoof award he once received from Private Eye. We\u2019re led from Goon Show fandom via university friendship with Terry Jones to his writing break on The Frost Report. Then comes Monty Python: he reads out a prim list of cuts to Holy Grail proposed by the censor, and scenes that never made Life of Brian\u2019s final script. Save a brief update on Jones\u2019 health (he was diagnosed with dementia in 2015), there are few insights, intimacies or gossip. There\u2019s barely time: an hour on stage can\u2019t do justice to a 55-year career. Certainly, the inner Michael \u2013 assuming there is one beneath the courtly and affable veneer \u2013 remains as obscure as the wreck of the Erebus these last 150 years. But if the show only skims the surface, this compendium of clips, anecdotes \u2013 and a closing Lumberjack Song singalong \u2013 is delivered with characteristic humour and good grace. \u2022 At the Cambridge Corn Exchange on 9 June. Then touring until 7 July.",

When we get dressed, we tell people all sorts of things about ourselves, some obvious and some more tenderly private. And yet our sartorial semaphore receives little close attention. Writing about clothes generally means fashion writing \u2013 and fashion writing, whose engine is commerce, cares mostly for novelty. It understands \u2013 or assumes \u2013 that you might want this season\u2019s dress. But it isn\u2019t really interested in emotions that run deeper than covetousness and vanity; in the pain you still feel across your heart, say, when you remember your grandmother\u2019s evening bag, left in a taxi when your mind and hands were elsewhere.</p> <p>Shahidha Bari\u2019s <em>Dressed</em>, then, should have been purest catnip for me, the kind of book I\u2019ve longed for half my life. Its high-minded intentions are obvious even before you open it: thanks to her publisher, which has been generous, it<em> </em>is more than elegant enough to inhabit one of those fashion emporiums for the thinking woman where hardbacks slyly cosy up to the latest trainers and piles of white T-shirts. In her introduction, moreover, Bari makes some pretty grand claims, writing that she would like to put aside the \u201cdistracting questions\u201d of what constitutes fashion, replacing them with what she calls \u201ca kind of philosophy of dress\u201d. For her, there exists the possibility that clothes can be understood as \u201cideas\u201d, and that in their comprehension it might be possible to understand the world \u201cin firmer, <em>felt</em> truths\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her voice is entirely unmodulated, her words steadily piling up, like balled tights in a crowded sock drawer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One gathers, reading on, that she is not talking here about control pants. But what <em>is</em> she talking about, exactly? To be truthful, I am unable to summarise her arguments for the simple reason that I\u2019m not sure she has any.

But my real problem with <em>Dressed</em> hasn\u2019t to do with its thinking. It\u2019s more a matter of tone. Sometimes, we get a glimpse of the richer, more exciting book it might have been: when Bari describes the \u201cbeastly\u201d origins of muslin, say, which was traditionally carded from cotton plants using the jawbone of a catfish, or when she reminds us of what Simone de Beauvoir said in <em>The Second Sex</em> about adolescent girls (\u201ctorn between the wish and the refusal to display\u201d).

She is seemingly as afraid of judgment as she is of questions of taste and class \u2013 aspects of clothes that seem unignorable and vital to me. I understand that she isn\u2019t interested in fashion, per se. But still, Diana Vreeland, a dash of whose daffy wit she could really use sometimes, and even that great genius Balenciaga, make not a single appearance between them.

I understand that she isn\u2019t interested in fashion, per se. But still, Diana Vreeland, a dash of whose daffy wit she could really use sometimes, and even that great genius Balenciaga, make not a single appearance between them. The search for a smart book about clothes, I\u2019m afraid, goes on. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 June 2019 to clarify that it was a source cited in the book, not Bari, who wrote the description, quoted in this review, of a ballet dancer\u2019s pointe. \u2022 Dressed: The Secret Life of Clothes by Shahidha Bari is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a325).

      "body": "<p>Take a look at your reflection. What do you see? Who do you think you are? When the writer Dani Shapiro was a little girl, she would sneak down the hall late at night once her parents were asleep, the better to stare at herself uninterrupted in the bathroom mirror. She felt, though she would not have been able to articulate this at the time, different \u2013 a creature apart. Perhaps if she gazed at herself for long enough, a new face would emerge from behind her own: a truer one, a face that would better reflect her sense of herself.</p> <p>As she grew older, this otherness \u2013 a disconnect she carried with her all the time \u2013 grew more and more powerful. It was, she says, as though she was \u201ctrapped on the other side of an invisible wall, separate and cut off\u201d \u2013 and yet, she had no idea why. In the New Jersey neighbourhood where she grew up, the only child in an Orthodox Jewish family, she would wander the streets with her poodle, hoping to be invited in by neighbours. She wonders now if she wasn\u2019t looking for a new family. Did other people see her as different? Well, they were certainly struck by her appearance. Shapiro has white-blonde hair and blue eyes. One day in the late 1960s, a family friend, Mrs Kushner \u2013 the future grandmother of Jared, husband of Ivanka Trump \u2013 pulled her to one side. Mrs Kushner had lived in Poland during the war. \u201cWe could have used you in the ghetto, little blondie,\u201d she said, gripping her arm. \u201cYou could have gotten us bread from the Nazis.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro is the author of several bestselling <a href=\"https://danishapiro.com/books/\" title=\"\">memoirs</a>, her stock-in-trade the public unpicking of life\u2019s more complicated knots. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to make meaning out of things that are difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cTo attempt to order the chaos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d83b99847721e3229cc6f3b4869edea185a410d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d83b99847721e3229cc6f3b4869edea185a410d7/0_154_4318_2590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dani Shapiro as a child with her father on board a ship in New Jersey in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018My parents created a myth. They worried what people would think\u2019: with her father in New Jersey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But down the years (she\u2019s in her 50s now), she\u2019d also come to accept that there was a mystery at the centre of her life: something on which she couldn\u2019t put her finger. In June 2016, however, the mystery was solved. Shapiro inadvertently made a discovery, at which point her otherness, and her blonde hair, suddenly made sense \u2013 though everything else she thought she knew now crumbled to dust.</p> <p>\u201cAn air of unreality settled around me,\u201d she writes in her new memoir, <em>Inheritance</em>. \u201cI was stupid, disbelieving. Nothing computed.\u201d Who do you think you are? This was a question that she both could, and couldn\u2019t, answer.</p> <p><em><strong>In 2016, Shapiro\u2019s</strong></em> parents were no longer alive: her loving father, whom she adored; her difficult mother, to whom she was never close. That summer, her husband, Michael, curious about his origins, had sent away for one of the DNA-testing kits that are now the US\u2019s most popular holiday gift (last year, 12m were sold; in total, some 26m people have taken a test, adding their DNA to the four leading commercial ancestry databases), and one night the two of them spat into two vials. Weeks later an email arrived, containing their results. She and Michael were puzzled by hers: according to <a href=\"https://www.ancestry.co.uk/?pgrid=26360187430&amp;ptaid=kwd-29052520&amp;s_kwcid=ancestry&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMImofGks--4gIVxrTtCh36oQKtEAAYASAAEgLOLvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;o_xid=59285&amp;o_lid=59285&amp;o_sch=Paid+Search+Brand\" title=\"\">the Ancestry website</a>, her DNA was only 52% eastern European Ashkenazi, and the rest a smattering of French, Irish, English and German. But they were hardly concerned \u2013 until they decided to compare her results with those of her half-sister, Susie, at which point Michael grasped that the two women were not, in fact, related at all.</p> <p>This could mean only one of two things: either Shapiro\u2019s father was not Susie\u2019s father, or he was not hers. In her gut, Shapiro knew immediately that he was Susie\u2019s father. Susie looked like him, whereas she looked like no one in their family. But how could this be? Her dear dad, her soulmate. After this, things moved quickly. On Ancestry, a first cousin \u2013 one unfamiliar to Shapiro \u2013 was listed. It didn\u2019t take much digging to discover that his mother had two surviving brothers, one of whom, a doctor, had been a medical student in Philadelphia, the city to which, Shapiro now remembered, her parents had once travelled for fertility treatment (her mother had mentioned this only twice to her daughter in her lifetime, and always in a way that brooked no discussion). Was it possible that this man \u2013 in her book, Shapiro calls him Ben Walden \u2013 had been a sperm donor back in the day, and his sperm \u201cmixed\u201d with that of her father? (Clinics, then unregulated, often used this practice to improve their results; patients were told to go home and think no more about it.) Yes, it was more than possible. Having found him online, she watched a video on his website in which he appeared before her: a man with her colouring, her jaw, her eyes, her voice and her hand gestures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"325652d4378cb7a35224d0c3fe5de2c3a75abe9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/325652d4378cb7a35224d0c3fe5de2c3a75abe9d/0_225_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dani Shapiro, in jeans, a black top and ankle boots, at her home in Connecticut, in her study/library, surrounded by shelves of books and Persian rugs\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018This is complex.

In the moment of her discovery, she felt traumatised and alone. Why had her parents gone to their graves carrying so huge a secret?</p> <p>But she knows now that she really isn\u2019t alone. \u201cThis is my 10th book,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it. On tour, every event has been wall to wall. It\u2019s fascinating. I can almost pick them out now. In every audience, there is a significant number of people who have discovered family secrets of their own: adoptees who were never told; donor-conceived people who never knew; parents who made a decision not to disclose the truth to their children, but who now realise that is no longer viable; older men \u2013 not my usual kind of reader \u2013 who have been anonymous donors, and who have either already been contacted [by their biological children], or who believe there\u2019s a good chance they might be.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was hard to move past a sense of having been betrayed by my parents</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Shapiro believes that in the US there is currently \u201ca kind of epidemic\u201d in terms of the numbers of people who are learning the truth about their identity. \u201cThe kits are so popular. It is a bit of a national obsession. The statistic in the industry is that approximately 2% of people who take a DNA test discover an NPE \u2013 that is, to use the terminology, they are Not Parent Expected, or a Non Parental Event. If 12m kits were sold in the US last year, then around 240,000 people have discovered their parent is not their parent \u2013 and they\u2019re only the ones who\u2019ve taken a test.\u201d</p> <p>Her book, Shapiro thinks, speaks to this \u201cepidemic\u201d, the literature around donor insemination being surprisingly scant \u2013 and though <em>Inheritance</em> is a highly personal book, one that seeks to tell only her story, in the months since she finished writing it, she has grown ever more focused on what she regards as the long-ignored ethical issues involved in donor insemination.</p> <p>\u201cIn my parents\u2019 time, there was no regulation. I\u2019ve spoken with many people who made the discovery they were donor-conceived, and then almost immediately found 27 half-siblings, 42 half-siblings. This is happening all the time. But even now, the situation is not much better.\u201d In the UK, donors can no longer be anonymous (the <a href=\"https://www.hfea.gov.uk/donation/donors/rules-around-releasing-donor-information/\" title=\"\">law changed</a> in 2005). But in the US and Canada, it\u2019s still permitted.</p> <p>\u201cMany donors still tick the anonymity box. That needs to change, partly because of the consequences for their biological children \u2013 my book is instructive about what it\u2019s like to discover you\u2019re the child of an anonymous donor \u2013 but also because they will be found. There\u2019s a basic misunderstanding about DNA testing. My [biological] father had not had a DNA test. But a nephew of his had and so I found him. Anonymity is over. We need to ask if the guarantee of anonymity made by sperm banks is still valid when the world has changed \u2013 and the science has changed.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e911f83dd75cc9e9fdf95adba3e6878f6005d181\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e911f83dd75cc9e9fdf95adba3e6878f6005d181/126_241_1483_890/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dani Shapiro, right, visited Hawaii in 1966 with her parents, Irene and Paul Shapiro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I\u2019ve come to experience them as creatures of their time\u2019.

What is the moral responsibility of someone who once donated sperm? And what is the moral responsibility of someone who discovers they were conceived in that way to the donor? A few decades from now, people will say, \u2018My God, I can\u2019t believe it ever happened that way.\u2019 Science is going to force us into a place where there can\u2019t be these secrets. But right now, we\u2019re dealing with a tidal wave.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro is lucky.<em><strong> </strong></em>Her experience, after the initial shock, was positive. She wanted to meet her biological father and, after some hesitation, he agreed. They got on well and their relationship \u2013 a warm friendship \u2013 is ongoing. \u201cHe did the right thing,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is a lovely human being and I recognise aspects of myself in him. But I\u2019ve heard a lot of stories, and they\u2019re not all good. If I\u2019d found my biological father, and he was mean and had different politics from me and lived a life I didn\u2019t recognise, that might have been different. Or if he had not wanted to meet me at all. That would also have been difficult.\u201d Meeting Ben has helped her to feel, at last, \u201clike a complete person\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The home DNA kits are so popular. It is a bit of a national obsession</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Nor did her discovery, ultimately, change her feelings for the man she grew up with. \u201cI hated it when people said to me: \u2018Your father\u2019s still your father.\u2019 But when people said: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have loved you more,\u2019 I knew that was true. At first, it was hard to move past a sense of having been betrayed by my parents, but I\u2019ve come to experience them as creatures of their time. This could not have been easy for them.\u201d Their infertility, and the secret they shared, has shed new light on their relationship. \u201cMy father was certainly sad and beaten down \u2013 before he married my mother, he\u2019d been divorced and widowed \u2013 and my mother did have a personality disorder. But what they went through to conceive me and what they then did to pack away the knowledge of it \u2013 that just poured gasoline over the whole thing. It had a great deal to do, I see now, with my father becoming a shadowy figure and with my mother\u2019s rage and contempt for him.\u201d</p> <p>Shapiro was closer by far to her father, who was not biologically related to her, than to her mother, who never stopped reminding her daughter that it was to her that she owed her existence. \u201cBut if anything, I love him more than before. I talk to him more; I feel him around me more. This knowledge has led to an evolution of something I already felt: the sense that who we love, and feel connected to, sometimes has to do with biology, and sometimes not. I\u2019m less and less interested in the prescribed rules about these things. My parents created a myth.

The first time she saw her beloved aunt Shirley and her cousins on her father\u2019s side after her secret was out, she felt closer to them than ever. \u201cThere was a truth between us,\u201d she says. \u201cThis profound openness.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62232b90af77803b5c7a2446a1a51ab262934040\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62232b90af77803b5c7a2446a1a51ab262934040/577_1046_5614_3368/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dad and a young Dani in the Algarve\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018If anything, I love him more than before\u2019: a holiday hug from her father.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And what of her Jewishness?

      "bodyText": "Take a look at your reflection. What do you see? Who do you think you are? When the writer Dani Shapiro was a little girl, she would sneak down the hall late at night once her parents were asleep, the better to stare at herself uninterrupted in the bathroom mirror. She felt, though she would not have been able to articulate this at the time, different \u2013 a creature apart. Perhaps if she gazed at herself for long enough, a new face would emerge from behind her own: a truer one, a face that would better reflect her sense of herself. As she grew older, this otherness \u2013 a disconnect she carried with her all the time \u2013 grew more and more powerful. It was, she says, as though she was \u201ctrapped on the other side of an invisible wall, separate and cut off\u201d \u2013 and yet, she had no idea why. In the New Jersey neighbourhood where she grew up, the only child in an Orthodox Jewish family, she would wander the streets with her poodle, hoping to be invited in by neighbours. She wonders now if she wasn\u2019t looking for a new family. Did other people see her as different? Well, they were certainly struck by her appearance. Shapiro has white-blonde hair and blue eyes. One day in the late 1960s, a family friend, Mrs Kushner \u2013 the future grandmother of Jared, husband of Ivanka Trump \u2013 pulled her to one side. Mrs Kushner had lived in Poland during the war. \u201cWe could have used you in the ghetto, little blondie,\u201d she said, gripping her arm. \u201cYou could have gotten us bread from the Nazis.\u201d Shapiro is the author of several bestselling memoirs, her stock-in-trade the public unpicking of life\u2019s more complicated knots. \u201cI\u2019ve always tried to make meaning out of things that are difficult,\u201d she says. \u201cTo attempt to order the chaos.\u201d But down the years (she\u2019s in her 50s now), she\u2019d also come to accept that there was a mystery at the centre of her life: something on which she couldn\u2019t put her finger. In June 2016, however, the mystery was solved. Shapiro inadvertently made a discovery, at which point her otherness, and her blonde hair, suddenly made sense \u2013 though everything else she thought she knew now crumbled to dust. \u201cAn air of unreality settled around me,\u201d she writes in her new memoir, Inheritance. \u201cI was stupid, disbelieving. Nothing computed.\u201d Who do you think you are? This was a question that she both could, and couldn\u2019t, answer. In 2016, Shapiro\u2019s parents were no longer alive: her loving father, whom she adored; her difficult mother, to whom she was never close. That summer, her husband, Michael, curious about his origins, had sent away for one of the DNA-testing kits that are now the US\u2019s most popular holiday gift (last year, 12m were sold; in total, some 26m people have taken a test, adding their DNA to the four leading commercial ancestry databases), and one night the two of them spat into two vials. Weeks later an email arrived, containing their results. She and Michael were puzzled by hers: according to the Ancestry website, her DNA was only 52% eastern European Ashkenazi, and the rest a smattering of French, Irish, English and German. But they were hardly concerned \u2013 until they decided to compare her results with those of her half-sister, Susie, at which point Michael grasped that the two women were not, in fact, related at all. This could mean only one of two things: either Shapiro\u2019s father was not Susie\u2019s father, or he was not hers. In her gut, Shapiro knew immediately that he was Susie\u2019s father. Susie looked like him, whereas she looked like no one in their family. But how could this be? Her dear dad, her soulmate. After this, things moved quickly. On Ancestry, a first cousin \u2013 one unfamiliar to Shapiro \u2013 was listed. It didn\u2019t take much digging to discover that his mother had two surviving brothers, one of whom, a doctor, had been a medical student in Philadelphia, the city to which, Shapiro now remembered, her parents had once travelled for fertility treatment (her mother had mentioned this only twice to her daughter in her lifetime, and always in a way that brooked no discussion). Was it possible that this man \u2013 in her book, Shapiro calls him Ben Walden \u2013 had been a sperm donor back in the day, and his sperm \u201cmixed\u201d with that of her father? (Clinics, then unregulated, often used this practice to improve their results; patients were told to go home and think no more about it.) Yes, it was more than possible. Having found him online, she watched a video on his website in which he appeared before her: a man with her colouring, her jaw, her eyes, her voice and her hand gestures. On my own computer screen \u2013 we talk via Skype; she is in a hotel room in New York, a stopping point on her US book tour \u2013 I see Shapiro smile. In the moment of her discovery, she felt traumatised and alone. Why had her parents gone to their graves carrying so huge a secret? But she knows now that she really isn\u2019t alone. \u201cThis is my 10th book,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it. On tour, every event has been wall to wall. It\u2019s fascinating. I can almost pick them out now. In every audience, there is a significant number of people who have discovered family secrets of their own: adoptees who were never told; donor-conceived people who never knew; parents who made a decision not to disclose the truth to their children, but who now realise that is no longer viable; older men \u2013 not my usual kind of reader \u2013 who have been anonymous donors, and who have either already been contacted [by their biological children], or who believe there\u2019s a good chance they might be.\u201d Shapiro believes that in the US there is currently \u201ca kind of epidemic\u201d in terms of the numbers of people who are learning the truth about their identity. \u201cThe kits are so popular. It is a bit of a national obsession. The statistic in the industry is that approximately 2% of people who take a DNA test discover an NPE \u2013 that is, to use the terminology, they are Not Parent Expected, or a Non Parental Event. If 12m kits were sold in the US last year, then around 240,000 people have discovered their parent is not their parent \u2013 and they\u2019re only the ones who\u2019ve taken a test.\u201d Her book, Shapiro thinks, speaks to this \u201cepidemic\u201d, the literature around donor insemination being surprisingly scant \u2013 and though Inheritance is a highly personal book, one that seeks to tell only her story, in the months since she finished writing it, she has grown ever more focused on what she regards as the long-ignored ethical issues involved in donor insemination. \u201cIn my parents\u2019 time, there was no regulation. I\u2019ve spoken with many people who made the discovery they were donor-conceived, and then almost immediately found 27 half-siblings, 42 half-siblings. This is happening all the time. But even now, the situation is not much better.\u201d In the UK, donors can no longer be anonymous (the law changed in 2005). But in the US and Canada, it\u2019s still permitted. \u201cMany donors still tick the anonymity box. That needs to change, partly because of the consequences for their biological children \u2013 my book is instructive about what it\u2019s like to discover you\u2019re the child of an anonymous donor \u2013 but also because they will be found. There\u2019s a basic misunderstanding about DNA testing. My [biological] father had not had a DNA test. But a nephew of his had and so I found him. Anonymity is over. We need to ask if the guarantee of anonymity made by sperm banks is still valid when the world has changed \u2013 and the science has changed.\u201d In recent weeks, Shapiro has spoken at the bio-ethics departments of both Harvard and Stanford universities. \u201cThis is complex. What is the moral responsibility of someone who once donated sperm? And what is the moral responsibility of someone who discovers they were conceived in that way to the donor? A few decades from now, people will say, \u2018My God, I can\u2019t believe it ever happened that way.\u2019 Science is going to force us into a place where there can\u2019t be these secrets. But right now, we\u2019re dealing with a tidal wave.\u201d Shapiro is lucky. Her experience, after the initial shock, was positive. She wanted to meet her biological father and, after some hesitation, he agreed. They got on well and their relationship \u2013 a warm friendship \u2013 is ongoing. \u201cHe did the right thing,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is a lovely human being and I recognise aspects of myself in him. But I\u2019ve heard a lot of stories, and they\u2019re not all good. If I\u2019d found my biological father, and he was mean and had different politics from me and lived a life I didn\u2019t recognise, that might have been different. Or if he had not wanted to meet me at all. That would also have been difficult.\u201d Meeting Ben has helped her to feel, at last, \u201clike a complete person\u201d. Nor did her discovery, ultimately, change her feelings for the man she grew up with. \u201cI hated it when people said to me: \u2018Your father\u2019s still your father.\u2019 But when people said: \u2018He couldn\u2019t have loved you more,\u2019 I knew that was true. At first, it was hard to move past a sense of having been betrayed by my parents, but I\u2019ve come to experience them as creatures of their time. This could not have been easy for them.\u201d Their infertility, and the secret they shared, has shed new light on their relationship. \u201cMy father was certainly sad and beaten down \u2013 before he married my mother, he\u2019d been divorced and widowed \u2013 and my mother did have a personality disorder. But what they went through to conceive me and what they then did to pack away the knowledge of it \u2013 that just poured gasoline over the whole thing. It had a great deal to do, I see now, with my father becoming a shadowy figure and with my mother\u2019s rage and contempt for him.\u201d Shapiro was closer by far to her father, who was not biologically related to her, than to her mother, who never stopped reminding her daughter that it was to her that she owed her existence. \u201cBut if anything, I love him more than before. I talk to him more; I feel him around me more. This knowledge has led to an evolution of something I already felt: the sense that who we love, and feel connected to, sometimes has to do with biology, and sometimes not. I\u2019m less and less interested in the prescribed rules about these things. My parents created a myth. They worried what people would think, but there was also the fear that their child wouldn\u2019t love them as much if she knew the truth \u2013 and I can\u2019t imagine such a thing.\u201d This sense extends outwards, to other members of her family. The first time she saw her beloved aunt Shirley and her cousins on her father\u2019s side after her secret was out, she felt closer to them than ever. \u201cThere was a truth between us,\u201d she says. \u201cThis profound openness.\u201d And what of her Jewishness?

      "body": "<p>Last November, Amina Thomson, who describes herself as a faith-based psychotherapist, was having lunch in the kitchen cafe at the al-Manaar Muslim cultural heritage centre in north Kensington. After the fire at Grenfell Tower half a mile away in June 2017, the basement kitchen had become recognised as the heartbeat of the local community, as it tried to cope with the ongoing aftershocks of the tragedy in which 72 people died. Meghan Markle had helped to launch a bestselling charity cookbook with the women who volunteered there each day.</p> <p>The kitchen may have become a byword for resilience and compassion, but that lunchtime Thomson, 55, a quietly spoken and bright-eyed presence, was listening to a conversation at a neighbouring table and feeling that something was not quite right. A woman bereaved in the Grenfell fire was sobbing and her friends, sitting with her, though sympathetic, were insisting she dry her eyes, saying that the time for tears had passed.</p> <p>Thomson, who had been counselling some of the bereaved, was prompted by watching that exchange to offer a new type of group therapy at the mosque, the basic message of which was that it was \u201cOK for Muslim women to cry in public\u201d. The group of about 30 women who started to come along, all directly or indirectly traumatised by the fire, has now met every Friday for six months. One of the regular attendees, who lost her home in the shadow of Grenfell and still lives in a hotel, explained to me how it had been considered taboo among some women to admit to psychological problems in the two years since the fire. \u201cSo many people are in need of help, but they don\u2019t know what they need,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my community they do not always understand mental illness or depression. It is seen as not normal.\u201d</p> <p>Thomson started the first session by reading with the group a story from the Qur\u2019an in which the prophet Yaqub cried until he lost his eyesight after his son was taken from him. \u201cSome people here think that being a Muslim means that you should accept suffering and not complain about your distress, but that is not right,\u201d Thomson told me. \u201cThe prophet was asked why he was crying, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m a human being\u2019. He had lost his son. If prophets can cry, then we can cry too.\u201d</p> <p>Thomson calls her model of therapy \u201cheartfulness\u201d because it insists that a balance of mind begins to be restored by the \u201ctranquillity of the heart\u201d: to be induced by good breathing, diet, rest, exercise and prayers \u2013 <em>dhikrs</em> \u2014 that help \u201cremembrance of Allah\u201d. She subsequently uses Qur\u2019anic texts with which the women are familiar to open discussions about trauma. Talking about the detail of this practice Thomson, Moroccan by birth, jumps quickly between noted psychologists and Islamic prophets, between attachment theory and Allah. \u201cWomen have started coming here out of their homes,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere before they were quite isolated. Some are psychiatric patients. Some have directly lost people \u2013 in one case a whole family has gone and the mother comes.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8284bab9c11eed5d9082366b36849f6927c0c726\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8284bab9c11eed5d9082366b36849f6927c0c726/833_476_4886_2932/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Therapist Amina Thomson, who is using faith teachings to help survivors of Grenfell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Therapist Amina Thomson, who is using faith teachings to help survivors of Grenfell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of last month, Thomson invited me to join one of those sessions in the upstairs library at al-Manaar. The women did not feel comfortable with a man being present while they went through the initial exercises that involved breathing and prayer and massage. By the time I came in they had moved on to the day\u2019s story, which concerned the death of Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Abu Talib, and \u201cthe year of grief\u201d. In the early sessions the women had apparently been reluctant to open up to the group about the feelings a story gave them, but now, at Thomson\u2019s encouragement, they first talked in small groups and then to the room.</p> <p>I was surprised to note that the traumas they dwelt on were mostly rooted not in the here and now of their lives after Grenfell, but more often in the countries many of them had left behind: Syria, Libya, Eritrea, Somalia. In relating the text to wars that they had escaped, in which their families were lost or still suffered, several of the women wept and no one suggested that they should stop.</p> <p>\u201cJean Piaget, [the developmental psychologist] calls those moments the schemas,\u201d Thomson said to me later. \u201cThey are the moments when you can change the narrative. We collect them and build on them each week.\u201d</p> <p>The session in the mosque offered a tiny window into what, two years on, is the ever-growing legacy of the Grenfell fire. When the flames had finally been extinguished following that terrible night, the aftermath first looked like a crisis of governance and organisation, then one of care and housing; it now registers increasingly as a mental health disaster. The scale of that trauma \u2013 impossible to fathom among those who escaped from the tower or lost loved ones \u2013 has been greatly amplified by the fact that many people who lived in the vicinity of Grenfell had in childhood fled from conflict or terror. For those one-time refugees, the unavoidable sight of the inferno, and the chaos and displacement that ensued, made all sorts of buried nightmares resurface.</p> <p>The NHS recovery unit\u2019s response to the fire is said to be the biggest of its kind in Europe \u2013 more than \u00a310m has been spent on treatment of the mental health of those affected. In the year after the fire, 2,674 adults and 463 children were screened for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.

Virtual reality headsets have been used to aid in assessing ever greater numbers of people involved and hundreds of people are still coming forward for treatment. The website explaining the options available \u2013 which range from bereavement counselling to cognitive behavioural therapy to psychiatric interventions \u2013 is available in dozens of languages.</p> <p>But still, as Dr Alastair Bailey, consultant clinical psychologist for the Grenfell trauma service acknowledged at the time of the opening of the St Charles Centre, certain groups remain hard to reach. \u201cFor some people it\u2019s taken a long time to get past a barrier around feelings of shame or stigma, or other concerns that they have about coming forward and accessing help,\u201d Bailey said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b90408ff653f82f59f2874fcafe1283f1fb90d97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b90408ff653f82f59f2874fcafe1283f1fb90d97/259_245_5178_3107/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A couple look at tributes left at a memorial wall by Grenfell Tower a year after the disaster.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A couple look at tributes left at a memorial wall by Grenfell Tower a year after the disaster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Dawson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Following the afternoon group therapy session at al-Manaar, I spent a day driving around west London with Thomson, meeting some of the several dozen individuals whom she also visits for face-to-face \u201cheartfulness\u201d sessions. About 60% of all those affected by the fire are Muslim. All of the people we met who had been made homeless directly by Grenfell, were still living in hotels or temporary accommodation. Thomson devotes two days a week to this work. She tries to see a dozen people each day.</p> <p>It was reported after the fire that there was a degree of resentment about the sharing of resources from those who had escaped from the building itself towards those who had \u201conly seen it through the window\u201d. Having spent several days listening to the testimonies of survivors and the bereaved at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/dec/13/grenfell-tower-inquiry-what-weve-learned-so-far\" title=\"\">Grenfell inquiry</a> last year, I could imagine those feelings. However, after sitting with a number of Thomson\u2019s patients, you realise quickly there is no easy hierarchy of pain \u2013 or rather that trauma can be cumulative as well as sudden.</p> <p>For many of the people Thomson deals with, Grenfell was only the latest disaster to befall them. \u201cA lot of people have come from different traumas and the fire is the last straw if you like. It has come in a place where they thought they were finally safe,\u201d Thomson says. She smiles a little wearily. \u201cEach day, I find myself now in the middle of the Somalian civil war, the war in Lebanon and Iraq and Eritrea and Sudan.\u201d</p> <p>For a few hours in Thomson\u2019s company as she made her round of visits I felt first-hand what she meant. The first two of her patients that we met, whose stories are told at greater length below, had both escaped from Somalia during the civil war. Ifrah Abdiguled, 53, had lost her two infant children in that conflict. Mourad Haad Hussin, 45, had seen his whole family murdered. Now here they were, 20 years later, trying to piece back together once again their shattered emotions. Others we spoke to remain too traumatised to be identified by name. One young man, who lost his wife in the fire, decided he did not wish to tell his story to me; instead he laid out in front of me page after page of drawings he had made obsessively in his wife\u2019s memory. Another woman, who at the time of the fire was in hiding from her abusive husband, still lives in fear of him finding her. She explained how, after arriving in London as a refugee she had married a man who routinely beat and choked her and finally threatened her with a gun. She showed me the scars on her arms and neck. Her place of refuge had been in a flat next to Grenfell. After the fire she had slept for four nights in a car, before being housed in a series of hotel rooms which she was frightened to leave at night. She lives in hope of a permanent place so that at some point she might be able to resume her work running a team of carers. Her therapy with Thomson, she believed, was slowly rebuilding her broken confidence. \u201cI used to earn \u00a33,500 a month,\u201d she said, crying quietly. \u201cNow I have \u00a3200.\u201d</p> <p>Thomson shoulders a lot of these people\u2019s problems herself. Though all of them have used, and often been grateful for, the services offered by their GPs and by the therapies at St Charles hospital, they say they find more relevance, and more trust in a model based on the faith that sustains them. As a result, Thomson has also found herself helping with the range of issues \u2013 housing, income, residency \u2013 that for two long years have exacerbated all of her patients\u2019 anxieties. \u201cI have never written so many letters,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cLetters to lawyers, letters about housing, letters to the MP, particularly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/19/emma-dent-coad-grenfell-interview-shaun-bailey\" title=\"\">Emma Dent-Coad</a>, who has been very helpful.\u201d While we drive between bedsits, Thomson explains that she comes from a long line of healers. She herself eventually came to the work after experiencing all the stages of trauma as a 15-year-old, when three family members, including her father, died in a car accident.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4906fe9ee438a906feb9cc78c28e232f061a266\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4906fe9ee438a906feb9cc78c28e232f061a266/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donations for victims of the fire are sorted after the disaster.

The charity Muslim Aid has been funding Thomson\u2019s programme, though that money is set to run out in September. The charity, whose staff were among the first responders on the ground at Grenfell, published a telling report last year on the disaster, called <a href=\"https://muslimaid.storage.googleapis.com/upload/www.muslimaid.org/media-centre/news/11-12-18_14-08-55_grenfell_report-cc_no_bleed%20%28copy%202%29.pdf\" title=\"\">Mind the Gap</a>. It made the case for a far greater involvement of local community groups in planning for such tragedies and for effective collaboration between secular and faith-based organisations in responding to them.</p> <p>A year on from that report, the charity sees the mental-health crisis that has flowed from Grenfell Tower as a case in point. One of the report\u2019s authors, Lotifa Begum, was among the first on the ground at Grenfell on the morning of the fire. She recalls how the flailing local authorities failed to ask for the help of humanitarian agencies to deal with the problems \u2013 though clearly an organisation like Muslim Aid, with experience of disaster response elsewhere in the world, and with deep links to this particular community, could have been invaluable.</p> <p>In the event, Begum helped to establish, along with representatives of three other charities, the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit, which worked alongside the authorities. \u201cThe council key workers were a bit lost in knowing how to help these families,\u201d she says. For a start, they had limited knowledge of Muslim burial practices, which were an urgent, heartbreaking issue; language was, and remains, a problem. \u201cOne incident will stay with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Begum says. \u201cNews had been delivered to an Afghani lady that her husband had passed away in the fire. She was wailing in the corridors of the relief centre and beating herself up, literally, because in Afghani culture, that is how they grieve. The council workers were astonished, they had no idea what to do. I eventually found a Farsi translator and we got her a room.\u201d</p> <p>Two years on, Begum believes that the reluctance of the local authority to properly engage with what their citizens need is seen in the response to Thomson\u2019s Heartfulness project. It obviously, and correctly, lies beyond the secular remit of the NHS to use religious frameworks to deliver therapy. However, there is a strong case for working with any such programme that can be shown to meet a complex need. In the next council funding round, however, Kensington and Chelsea has cut its grant for counselling services to al-Manaar by 10%, even though it has played such an expansive and pivotal role in supporting the Grenfell community. That cut will make it all but impossible for the centre to take on the cost of Thomson\u2019s programme as she had hoped, when the current funding runs out. \u201cI think there has to be an understanding that NHS and faith-based, community-based therapies need to be working hand in hand,\u201d Thomson herself argues. \u201cFaith and culture are clearly extremely important to these people and that is the language and the context which they understand.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of our day sitting in bedsits and hotel lobbies meeting those people still adrift in Grenfell\u2019s great disruption, Thomson suggests that she doesn\u2019t know how she will carry on providing her support to those desperate souls, though she knows she must. And for the first time she wipes away a tear herself.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4c72c295cf198ecc41b112e300a4f0d80cbb4761\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c72c295cf198ecc41b112e300a4f0d80cbb4761/0_687_6321_3793/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mourad Haad Hussin, a patient of Amina Thomson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mourad Haad Hussin, a patient of Amina Thomson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Mourad Haad Hussin: \u2018I saw three boys at the window up there\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Mourad Haad Hussin, 45, met us outside his studio flat. He has been receiving counselling from Amina Thomson for six months. While we talked his television was tuned to a channel in Arabic in the background. His English was heavily accented, but he was very anxious to make himself clear, so he repeated phrases until I understood them. After the Grenfell fire he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and given medication.</strong></p> <p>\u201cMy story begins when I was 14, in Somalia. One day I was playing football and four or five army cars come to my house. My family was in the house so I ran there and I hear \u2018Boom! Boom! Boom!\u2019 I come in and see my cousin, my brother, my uncle\u2019s body. Blood everywhere. My father is by the window and he throws me through it, like that, and he says \u2018Run! Run! Run!\u2019 Later we have to come back to the house and I see my father dead in the road. They shoot him in the leg and they run him over. My mum is there crying and our whole family is gone.</p> <p>\u201cThat was 30 years ago. We stayed two nights at the house and then me and my mum walked to Ethiopia, 10 days. We walked at night because the days were too dangerous. One night the war came to the place we have stopped and they kill 400 people, 500 people. I lie in a hole and they start throwing bodies on top of me and I am trapped like that until they pull me out.</p> <p>\u201cMy mum and I stayed in Ethiopia for four years. Somalia became a little bit more normal and my mother sold our house and used the money to send me here. She says: \u2018Run! Run! Run!\u2019 I worked in different jobs in London. Sometimes a kitchen porter, Claridge\u2019s kitchen. Sometimes in laundry, operating washing machines. I am alone, but when my mum is alive I don\u2019t need anyone. We call each other every night and every morning. But now last year she is gone too. If I was not a Muslim I would kill myself, but the Qu\u2019ran says I cannot do that if I want to meet my family again - and I want to meet my family.</p> <p>\u201cThe night of Grenfell I got up early for my pre-dawn Ramadan meal at two o\u2019clock. My pasta was ready when I saw the fire and I ran out there. The police are pushing, pushing, pushing. And the fire just goes up the side of the tower, whoosh like water. I looked up and I saw three boys at the window up there with the fire. People are shouting \u2018Run! Run! Run!\u2019 but they cannot run. I am there two days, two nights trying to help people. I can\u2019t go home. I can\u2019t sleep. I see the fire and I see the boys at the window.</p> <p>\u201cI sleepwalk every night; I have to hide my key in the washing machine. I wake up in the shower. My GP was kind; she says, your family were in the tower. She knows my story. And after I went to Amina and now I pray for Fridays when I see her. She is good with psychology, she knows the Qu\u2019ran. I want to get back to who I was before. They tell me to cry. Allah wants me to cry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"871443f1676a1f8c607fa09ef57b1f6cefc81909\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/871443f1676a1f8c607fa09ef57b1f6cefc81909/605_867_5491_3294/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ifrah Abiguled, another of the local people Thomson is helping.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ifrah Abiguled, another of the local people Thomson is helping.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Ifrah Abdiguled: \u2018My daughter had a friend in that tower\u2019</h2> <p><strong>On the morning I met </strong><strong>Ifrah, 53, she had just \u2013 after a two-year struggle since she left her home beside Grenfell Tower \u2013 been housed in a basement flat in </strong><strong>Earl\u2019s Court</strong> <strong>with her daughter, Fatema, 12. They were yet to unpack. Ifrah had come to the UK as a refugee from Somalia in the 1990s \u2013 her first two children, one six months old, and one aged two, had died during the bombing and famine of the civil war.</strong></p> <p>\u201cI have lived in London for 25 years. I always had lots of jobs, as a carer and as a cleaner. I lived in Whitechapel to start with then nine years ago I moved to a place right opposite Grenfell Tower. My daughter was at primary school there. We saw our friends at the swimming pool the previous day, we went to sleep that night and we wake up and it was just unbelievable that they were gone. My daughter had a friend who lived in that tower. She was shouting \u2018Hafsa! Hafsa!\u2019 over and over. We saw the people falling and everything and that started my stress and all the memories. It was the same as in Somalia: one minute you were sleeping and then you wake up and you had no idea what was going on. All my windows were facing the tower. I could not go back.</p> <p>\u201cWe were put in a hotel near Waterloo for seven months. Then they found us a place in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, but the antisocial behaviour was so bad. Seven people had moved out before us, I was told. It was music all night and people dealing drugs and swearing right up to your face. They threw dog\u2019s excrement through my window, lighted cigarettes. That was the worst time. I went to hospital, I was sectioned. Fatema went to live with my sister and I went to hospital for seven weeks with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>\u201cWe still had nowhere to live. They offered us a place in Hounslow, then one in Wembley, but they were too far from school for my daughter. They wanted me to sign something to say that they had offered two places and I had refused so that was it. Amina helped us a lot. She put me in touch with the MP Emma Dent Coad. And eventually we got this place.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I come to this country my mind was always going on back home to my children. It took me years to get past that. But at least I felt safe here \u2013 until that night. My daughter lost her friend Hafsa. She had two classmates that lived in the building. I take her to school, she doesn\u2019t like going on her own. It is maybe 40 minutes from here. When I get off the bus I always go around so I don\u2019t have to see the tower.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Last November, Amina Thomson, who describes herself as a faith-based psychotherapist, was having lunch in the kitchen cafe at the al-Manaar Muslim cultural heritage centre in north Kensington. After the fire at Grenfell Tower half a mile away in June 2017, the basement kitchen had become recognised as the heartbeat of the local community, as it tried to cope with the ongoing aftershocks of the tragedy in which 72 people died. Meghan Markle had helped to launch a bestselling charity cookbook with the women who volunteered there each day. The kitchen may have become a byword for resilience and compassion, but that lunchtime Thomson, 55, a quietly spoken and bright-eyed presence, was listening to a conversation at a neighbouring table and feeling that something was not quite right. A woman bereaved in the Grenfell fire was sobbing and her friends, sitting with her, though sympathetic, were insisting she dry her eyes, saying that the time for tears had passed. Thomson, who had been counselling some of the bereaved, was prompted by watching that exchange to offer a new type of group therapy at the mosque, the basic message of which was that it was \u201cOK for Muslim women to cry in public\u201d. The group of about 30 women who started to come along, all directly or indirectly traumatised by the fire, has now met every Friday for six months. One of the regular attendees, who lost her home in the shadow of Grenfell and still lives in a hotel, explained to me how it had been considered taboo among some women to admit to psychological problems in the two years since the fire. \u201cSo many people are in need of help, but they don\u2019t know what they need,\u201d she said. \u201cIn my community they do not always understand mental illness or depression. It is seen as not normal.\u201d Thomson started the first session by reading with the group a story from the Qur\u2019an in which the prophet Yaqub cried until he lost his eyesight after his son was taken from him. \u201cSome people here think that being a Muslim means that you should accept suffering and not complain about your distress, but that is not right,\u201d Thomson told me. \u201cThe prophet was asked why he was crying, and he said, \u2018I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m a human being\u2019. He had lost his son. If prophets can cry, then we can cry too.\u201d Thomson calls her model of therapy \u201cheartfulness\u201d because it insists that a balance of mind begins to be restored by the \u201ctranquillity of the heart\u201d: to be induced by good breathing, diet, rest, exercise and prayers \u2013 dhikrs \u2014 that help \u201cremembrance of Allah\u201d. She subsequently uses Qur\u2019anic texts with which the women are familiar to open discussions about trauma. Talking about the detail of this practice Thomson, Moroccan by birth, jumps quickly between noted psychologists and Islamic prophets, between attachment theory and Allah. \u201cWomen have started coming here out of their homes,\u201d she says, \u201cwhere before they were quite isolated. Some are psychiatric patients. Some have directly lost people \u2013 in one case a whole family has gone and the mother comes.\u201d At the end of last month, Thomson invited me to join one of those sessions in the upstairs library at al-Manaar. The women did not feel comfortable with a man being present while they went through the initial exercises that involved breathing and prayer and massage. By the time I came in they had moved on to the day\u2019s story, which concerned the death of Muhammad\u2019s uncle, Abu Talib, and \u201cthe year of grief\u201d. In the early sessions the women had apparently been reluctant to open up to the group about the feelings a story gave them, but now, at Thomson\u2019s encouragement, they first talked in small groups and then to the room. I was surprised to note that the traumas they dwelt on were mostly rooted not in the here and now of their lives after Grenfell, but more often in the countries many of them had left behind: Syria, Libya, Eritrea, Somalia. In relating the text to wars that they had escaped, in which their families were lost or still suffered, several of the women wept and no one suggested that they should stop. \u201cJean Piaget, [the developmental psychologist] calls those moments the schemas,\u201d Thomson said to me later. \u201cThey are the moments when you can change the narrative. We collect them and build on them each week.\u201d The session in the mosque offered a tiny window into what, two years on, is the ever-growing legacy of the Grenfell fire. When the flames had finally been extinguished following that terrible night, the aftermath first looked like a crisis of governance and organisation, then one of care and housing; it now registers increasingly as a mental health disaster. The scale of that trauma \u2013 impossible to fathom among those who escaped from the tower or lost loved ones \u2013 has been greatly amplified by the fact that many people who lived in the vicinity of Grenfell had in childhood fled from conflict or terror. For those one-time refugees, the unavoidable sight of the inferno, and the chaos and displacement that ensued, made all sorts of buried nightmares resurface. The NHS recovery unit\u2019s response to the fire is said to be the biggest of its kind in Europe \u2013 more than \u00a310m has been spent on treatment of the mental health of those affected. In the year after the fire, 2,674 adults and 463 children were screened for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Last year the St Charles Health and Wellbeing Centre was opened so that those affected by Grenfell could be treated in dedicated therapy suites. Virtual reality headsets have been used to aid in assessing ever greater numbers of people involved and hundreds of people are still coming forward for treatment. The website explaining the options available \u2013 which range from bereavement counselling to cognitive behavioural therapy to psychiatric interventions \u2013 is available in dozens of languages. But still, as Dr Alastair Bailey, consultant clinical psychologist for the Grenfell trauma service acknowledged at the time of the opening of the St Charles Centre, certain groups remain hard to reach. \u201cFor some people it\u2019s taken a long time to get past a barrier around feelings of shame or stigma, or other concerns that they have about coming forward and accessing help,\u201d Bailey said. Following the afternoon group therapy session at al-Manaar, I spent a day driving around west London with Thomson, meeting some of the several dozen individuals whom she also visits for face-to-face \u201cheartfulness\u201d sessions. About 60% of all those affected by the fire are Muslim. All of the people we met who had been made homeless directly by Grenfell, were still living in hotels or temporary accommodation. Thomson devotes two days a week to this work. She tries to see a dozen people each day. It was reported after the fire that there was a degree of resentment about the sharing of resources from those who had escaped from the building itself towards those who had \u201conly seen it through the window\u201d. Having spent several days listening to the testimonies of survivors and the bereaved at the Grenfell inquiry last year, I could imagine those feelings. However, after sitting with a number of Thomson\u2019s patients, you realise quickly there is no easy hierarchy of pain \u2013 or rather that trauma can be cumulative as well as sudden. For many of the people Thomson deals with, Grenfell was only the latest disaster to befall them. \u201cA lot of people have come from different traumas and the fire is the last straw if you like. It has come in a place where they thought they were finally safe,\u201d Thomson says. She smiles a little wearily. \u201cEach day, I find myself now in the middle of the Somalian civil war, the war in Lebanon and Iraq and Eritrea and Sudan.\u201d For a few hours in Thomson\u2019s company as she made her round of visits I felt first-hand what she meant. The first two of her patients that we met, whose stories are told at greater length below, had both escaped from Somalia during the civil war. Ifrah Abdiguled, 53, had lost her two infant children in that conflict. Mourad Haad Hussin, 45, had seen his whole family murdered. Now here they were, 20 years later, trying to piece back together once again their shattered emotions. Others we spoke to remain too traumatised to be identified by name. One young man, who lost his wife in the fire, decided he did not wish to tell his story to me; instead he laid out in front of me page after page of drawings he had made obsessively in his wife\u2019s memory. Another woman, who at the time of the fire was in hiding from her abusive husband, still lives in fear of him finding her. She explained how, after arriving in London as a refugee she had married a man who routinely beat and choked her and finally threatened her with a gun. She showed me the scars on her arms and neck. Her place of refuge had been in a flat next to Grenfell. After the fire she had slept for four nights in a car, before being housed in a series of hotel rooms which she was frightened to leave at night. She lives in hope of a permanent place so that at some point she might be able to resume her work running a team of carers. Her therapy with Thomson, she believed, was slowly rebuilding her broken confidence. \u201cI used to earn \u00a33,500 a month,\u201d she said, crying quietly. \u201cNow I have \u00a3200.\u201d Thomson shoulders a lot of these people\u2019s problems herself. Though all of them have used, and often been grateful for, the services offered by their GPs and by the therapies at St Charles hospital, they say they find more relevance, and more trust in a model based on the faith that sustains them. As a result, Thomson has also found herself helping with the range of issues \u2013 housing, income, residency \u2013 that for two long years have exacerbated all of her patients\u2019 anxieties. \u201cI have never written so many letters,\u201d Thomson says. \u201cLetters to lawyers, letters about housing, letters to the MP, particularly Emma Dent-Coad, who has been very helpful.\u201d While we drive between bedsits, Thomson explains that she comes from a long line of healers. She herself eventually came to the work after experiencing all the stages of trauma as a 15-year-old, when three family members, including her father, died in a car accident. Thomson\u2019s work not only appears effective as a solace for the people I meet, however; it also \u2013 like so many issues starkly highlighted by the tragedy \u2013 raises complex questions about the relationship between local authorities, national government and community organisations, and their responsibilities to the most vulnerable. The charity Muslim Aid has been funding Thomson\u2019s programme, though that money is set to run out in September. The charity, whose staff were among the first responders on the ground at Grenfell, published a telling report last year on the disaster, called Mind the Gap. It made the case for a far greater involvement of local community groups in planning for such tragedies and for effective collaboration between secular and faith-based organisations in responding to them. A year on from that report, the charity sees the mental-health crisis that has flowed from Grenfell Tower as a case in point. One of the report\u2019s authors, Lotifa Begum, was among the first on the ground at Grenfell on the morning of the fire. She recalls how the flailing local authorities failed to ask for the help of humanitarian agencies to deal with the problems \u2013 though clearly an organisation like Muslim Aid, with experience of disaster response elsewhere in the world, and with deep links to this particular community, could have been invaluable. In the event, Begum helped to establish, along with representatives of three other charities, the Grenfell Muslim Response Unit, which worked alongside the authorities. \u201cThe council key workers were a bit lost in knowing how to help these families,\u201d she says. For a start, they had limited knowledge of Muslim burial practices, which were an urgent, heartbreaking issue; language was, and remains, a problem. \u201cOne incident will stay with me for the rest of my life,\u201d Begum says. \u201cNews had been delivered to an Afghani lady that her husband had passed away in the fire. She was wailing in the corridors of the relief centre and beating herself up, literally, because in Afghani culture, that is how they grieve. The council workers were astonished, they had no idea what to do. I eventually found a Farsi translator and we got her a room.\u201d Two years on, Begum believes that the reluctance of the local authority to properly engage with what their citizens need is seen in the response to Thomson\u2019s Heartfulness project. It obviously, and correctly, lies beyond the secular remit of the NHS to use religious frameworks to deliver therapy. However, there is a strong case for working with any such programme that can be shown to meet a complex need. In the next council funding round, however, Kensington and Chelsea has cut its grant for counselling services to al-Manaar by 10%, even though it has played such an expansive and pivotal role in supporting the Grenfell community. That cut will make it all but impossible for the centre to take on the cost of Thomson\u2019s programme as she had hoped, when the current funding runs out. \u201cI think there has to be an understanding that NHS and faith-based, community-based therapies need to be working hand in hand,\u201d Thomson herself argues. \u201cFaith and culture are clearly extremely important to these people and that is the language and the context which they understand.\u201d At the end of our day sitting in bedsits and hotel lobbies meeting those people still adrift in Grenfell\u2019s great disruption, Thomson suggests that she doesn\u2019t know how she will carry on providing her support to those desperate souls, though she knows she must. And for the first time she wipes away a tear herself. Mourad Haad Hussin: \u2018I saw three boys at the window up there\u2019 Mourad Haad Hussin, 45, met us outside his studio flat. He has been receiving counselling from Amina Thomson for six months. While we talked his television was tuned to a channel in Arabic in the background. His English was heavily accented, but he was very anxious to make himself clear, so he repeated phrases until I understood them. After the Grenfell fire he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and given medication. \u201cMy story begins when I was 14, in Somalia. One day I was playing football and four or five army cars come to my house. My family was in the house so I ran there and I hear \u2018Boom! Boom! Boom!\u2019 I come in and see my cousin, my brother, my uncle\u2019s body. Blood everywhere. My father is by the window and he throws me through it, like that, and he says \u2018Run! Run! Run!\u2019 Later we have to come back to the house and I see my father dead in the road. They shoot him in the leg and they run him over. My mum is there crying and our whole family is gone. \u201cThat was 30 years ago. We stayed two nights at the house and then me and my mum walked to Ethiopia, 10 days. We walked at night because the days were too dangerous. One night the war came to the place we have stopped and they kill 400 people, 500 people. I lie in a hole and they start throwing bodies on top of me and I am trapped like that until they pull me out. \u201cMy mum and I stayed in Ethiopia for four years. Somalia became a little bit more normal and my mother sold our house and used the money to send me here. She says: \u2018Run! Run! Run!\u2019 I worked in different jobs in London. Sometimes a kitchen porter, Claridge\u2019s kitchen. Sometimes in laundry, operating washing machines. I am alone, but when my mum is alive I don\u2019t need anyone. We call each other every night and every morning. But now last year she is gone too. If I was not a Muslim I would kill myself, but the Qu\u2019ran says I cannot do that if I want to meet my family again - and I want to meet my family. \u201cThe night of Grenfell I got up early for my pre-dawn Ramadan meal at two o\u2019clock. My pasta was ready when I saw the fire and I ran out there. The police are pushing, pushing, pushing. And the fire just goes up the side of the tower, whoosh like water. I looked up and I saw three boys at the window up there with the fire. People are shouting \u2018Run! Run! Run!\u2019 but they cannot run. I am there two days, two nights trying to help people. I can\u2019t go home. I can\u2019t sleep. I see the fire and I see the boys at the window. \u201cI sleepwalk every night; I have to hide my key in the washing machine. I wake up in the shower. My GP was kind; she says, your family were in the tower. She knows my story. And after I went to Amina and now I pray for Fridays when I see her. She is good with psychology, she knows the Qu\u2019ran. I want to get back to who I was before. They tell me to cry. Allah wants me to cry.\u201d Ifrah Abdiguled: \u2018My daughter had a friend in that tower\u2019 On the morning I met Ifrah, 53, she had just \u2013 after a two-year struggle since she left her home beside Grenfell Tower \u2013 been housed in a basement flat in Earl\u2019s Court with her daughter, Fatema, 12. They were yet to unpack. Ifrah had come to the UK as a refugee from Somalia in the 1990s \u2013 her first two children, one six months old, and one aged two, had died during the bombing and famine of the civil war. \u201cI have lived in London for 25 years. I always had lots of jobs, as a carer and as a cleaner. I lived in Whitechapel to start with then nine years ago I moved to a place right opposite Grenfell Tower. My daughter was at primary school there. We saw our friends at the swimming pool the previous day, we went to sleep that night and we wake up and it was just unbelievable that they were gone. My daughter had a friend who lived in that tower. She was shouting \u2018Hafsa! Hafsa!\u2019 over and over. We saw the people falling and everything and that started my stress and all the memories. It was the same as in Somalia: one minute you were sleeping and then you wake up and you had no idea what was going on. All my windows were facing the tower. I could not go back. \u201cWe were put in a hotel near Waterloo for seven months. Then they found us a place in Shepherd\u2019s Bush, but the antisocial behaviour was so bad. Seven people had moved out before us, I was told. It was music all night and people dealing drugs and swearing right up to your face. They threw dog\u2019s excrement through my window, lighted cigarettes. That was the worst time. I went to hospital, I was sectioned. Fatema went to live with my sister and I went to hospital for seven weeks with post-traumatic stress disorder. \u201cWe still had nowhere to live. They offered us a place in Hounslow, then one in Wembley, but they were too far from school for my daughter. They wanted me to sign something to say that they had offered two places and I had refused so that was it. Amina helped us a lot. She put me in touch with the MP Emma Dent Coad. And eventually we got this place. \u201cWhen I come to this country my mind was always going on back home to my children. It took me years to get past that. But at least I felt safe here \u2013 until that night. My daughter lost her friend Hafsa. She had two classmates that lived in the building. I take her to school, she doesn\u2019t like going on her own. It is maybe 40 minutes from here. When I get off the bus I always go around so I don\u2019t have to see the tower.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "When Andy Ruiz Jr claimed his heavyweight title belt in Madison Square Garden last weekend it was the Mexican flag behind him, the flag of the country not where he was born but where his immigrant parents were from. \u201cI\u2019m the first Mexican heavyweight champion of the world,\u201d he said after knocking out American star Anthony Joshua. \u201cEveryone who thinks I\u2019m not Mexican simply because I was born in the United States is wrong,\u201d Ruiz told ESPN. \u201cMy mom and dad are from Mexicali, and I feel more Mexican than others who were born in Mexico because I fought for my race and for Mexico.\u201d The border region where Ruiz is from has long been known for being fiercely bi-cultural. Families in Mexico cross the border to go to school, work and shop. Families in the US cross the border to visit relatives, go to the dentist and shop. But with the arrival of president Donald Trump, tensions between the two countries have reached a new high. Trump made a war of words with Mexico the centerpiece of his presidential campaign and has lately been threatening across-the-board tariffs on all Mexican goods if the government of Mexico doesn\u2019t do more to stop migration to the United States. By proudly claiming a Mexican identity over an American one, Ruiz jumped into the center of a national political controversy. While Ruiz is the first Mexican heavyweight champion, he is not the first bicultural boxer to rise to prominence during a time of political tension between the two neighboring countries. Almost a century ago, a Mexican-American boxer called Bert Colima found himself in a similar situation. Epifanio Romero was known to everyone by his nickname, a conjunction of \u2018Bert\u2019 because as a child he liked to sing like birds (Bert is derived from the word \u2018bird\u2019) and \u2018Colima\u2019 for the Mexican state where his grandmother was from. He was born in Whittier, California in 1902. Colima was a well-known fighter in the California area, popular among Mexicans in Los Angeles for expressing his Mexican roots through his name change, said Servando Ortoll, a sociologist and historian who wrote a biography about the boxer called \u201cWhittier lightning.\u201d \u201cColima was not known in Mexico. He was born in the United States and like Andy Ruiz emerging in similar contexts \u201d said Ortoll in a telephone interview. Colima came of age as a boxer in the 1920s during a difficult period in Mexican-American relations. Mexico was emerging from its decade-long revolution and the two governments were locked in a battle over unpaid debts Mexico owed to US investors to recoup damages from the war. The US ambassador to Mexico, James R Sheffield, expressed racist views about Mexicans, calling them \u201cbarbarians who needed to be taken over and civilized by Sons of Mother Yale\u201d and cataloguing the Mexican cabinet members by how \u201cwhite blooded\u201d they were. Mexico\u2019s president Plutarco El\u00edas Calles made a political calculation to counter all of the hateful rhetoric coming from the United States. He saw Colima as an emblem of common ground between the two countries, knowing that he was a popular fighter in California who also overtly claimed his Mexican heritage, said Ortoll. Calles\u2019 government invited Colima to his first fight in Mexico City in March 1926 against the fighter Arthur Schaekels from Belgium. That fight was followed up by four more around the country in as many months. \u201cThe government of Calles chose him to entertain people in the middle of the turmoil in the country at that time\u201d said Ortoll. \u201cThey could have chosen other fighters that were around at that time, but they chose the one who had adopted a Mexican state for a last name.\u201d Colima was not a world champion but he is known as the first widely recognized Mexican-American boxer.

Immediately after Ruiz won his championship, he received a call from the recently elected [resident of Mexico Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador inviting him for a state visit.

      "body": "<p>Last Monday I attended the worst family dinner I have ever experienced. It honoured a visiting American with whom we were barely acquainted, but were somehow obliged to entertain.</p> \n<p>A few years previously our guest had suggested on a radio show that, despite thinking she was \u201ccrazy\u201d, he could have \u201cnailed\u201d my late mother. She feared he was \u201cstalking\u201d her. Our guest had then clarified that he would only have had sex with my mother if she had an Aids test, perhaps because she had shaken hands with Aids sufferers.</p> \n<p>Our guest had also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/02/donal-trump-denies-calling-meghan-nasty-despite-audio-recording\" title=\"\">called my own wife \u201cnasty\u201d</a>, and dismissed climate change, a cause close to my green father\u2019s heart, as a hoax. We made uneasy small talk with the American\u2019s wife, whom we all knew he had cheated on with an adult film actress. It was a dreadful, awkward evening.</p> \n<p>And then I woke up. I was not Prince Harry. And I was not having dinner with Donald Trump. I had merely fallen asleep in front of coverage of Trump\u2019s state banquet after eating a red leicester.</p> \n<p>In reality, selfless Prince Harry sucked up his humiliation, and the insults to his wife and dead mother, and did his royal best to secure the buccaneering post-Brexit trade future already guaranteed by his fellow diner Long John Liam Fox. But the reality of Trump\u2019s visit was arguably more bewildering than any cheesy dream.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4ce64d5cbb94dc5f67831a90a90fdd1c4745962\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ce64d5cbb94dc5f67831a90a90fdd1c4745962/0_0_2716_1630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump laughs with the Queen at a state banquet held at Buckingham palace.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump laughs with the Queen at a state banquet held at Buckingham palace.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the banquet held in his honour, Trump praised the allies\u2019 joint wartime effort against the tyranny of the Nazis, whom he seemed to view as uniformly bad. And yet, in 2017, Trump had said the neo-Nazi groups at Charlottesville\u2019s Unite the Right rally, where an anti-fascist protester was murdered, contained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\" title=\"\">\u201csome very fine people\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>American Nazis, of course, are likely to be \u201cvery fine\u201d, reflecting as they do the understandable anxieties of the ordinary American voter. But second world war European Nazis were just bad, period.</p> \n<p>Trump tweeted that he had been welcomed to the UK by thousands of well-wishers, but he demonstrably wasn\u2019t, to our national shame. Trump was welcomed, instead, by a pathetic statue of him sitting trouserless on a toilet, and a childish Trump-baby shaped barrage balloon, later burst by a woman who is forbidden by law to approach water.</p> \n<p>And in a field below Trump\u2019s incoming flight, an infantile student had mown a frankly immature <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2019/jun/03/oi-trump-penis-protests-ollie-nancarrow-essex-field-greets-donald-trump-flew-to-stansted\" title=\"\">massive penis into the grass</a> which, though it lacked the flecks of ejaculate and hairy testicular sack normally present on such images, was nonetheless utterly puerile. The anti-Trump demonstrators need to learn that, though they were entitled to dislike Donald Trump himself, it was wrong to disrespect the institution of the American presidency, which existed as an entity entirely separate from its incumbent.</p> \n<p>In a similar fashion, Rick Jones, Monica Rambeau and Carol Danvers have all been Captain Marvel at different times, dumbass. Given the medical inaccuracy of their mown penises, it is not surprising that none of the stone-cold losers in Parliament Square on Tuesday understood this.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"745f1ee3-bef9-4ef3-b67e-304dcc1c87f1\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>Travelling Trumps</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>When Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, arrive for a state visit to the UK on 3 June, they will reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/23/donald-trump-uk-state-visit-adult-children\">be joined</a> by the president\u2019s four adult children and their spouses.

      "bodyText": "Last Monday I attended the worst family dinner I have ever experienced. It honoured a visiting American with whom we were barely acquainted, but were somehow obliged to entertain. A few years previously our guest had suggested on a radio show that, despite thinking she was \u201ccrazy\u201d, he could have \u201cnailed\u201d my late mother. She feared he was \u201cstalking\u201d her. Our guest had then clarified that he would only have had sex with my mother if she had an Aids test, perhaps because she had shaken hands with Aids sufferers. Our guest had also called my own wife \u201cnasty\u201d, and dismissed climate change, a cause close to my green father\u2019s heart, as a hoax. We made uneasy small talk with the American\u2019s wife, whom we all knew he had cheated on with an adult film actress. It was a dreadful, awkward evening. And then I woke up. I was not Prince Harry. And I was not having dinner with Donald Trump. I had merely fallen asleep in front of coverage of Trump\u2019s state banquet after eating a red leicester. In reality, selfless Prince Harry sucked up his humiliation, and the insults to his wife and dead mother, and did his royal best to secure the buccaneering post-Brexit trade future already guaranteed by his fellow diner Long John Liam Fox. But the reality of Trump\u2019s visit was arguably more bewildering than any cheesy dream. At the banquet held in his honour, Trump praised the allies\u2019 joint wartime effort against the tyranny of the Nazis, whom he seemed to view as uniformly bad. And yet, in 2017, Trump had said the neo-Nazi groups at Charlottesville\u2019s Unite the Right rally, where an anti-fascist protester was murdered, contained \u201csome very fine people\u201d. American Nazis, of course, are likely to be \u201cvery fine\u201d, reflecting as they do the understandable anxieties of the ordinary American voter. But second world war European Nazis were just bad, period. Trump tweeted that he had been welcomed to the UK by thousands of well-wishers, but he demonstrably wasn\u2019t, to our national shame. Trump was welcomed, instead, by a pathetic statue of him sitting trouserless on a toilet, and a childish Trump-baby shaped barrage balloon, later burst by a woman who is forbidden by law to approach water. And in a field below Trump\u2019s incoming flight, an infantile student had mown a frankly immature massive penis into the grass which, though it lacked the flecks of ejaculate and hairy testicular sack normally present on such images, was nonetheless utterly puerile. The anti-Trump demonstrators need to learn that, though they were entitled to dislike Donald Trump himself, it was wrong to disrespect the institution of the American presidency, which existed as an entity entirely separate from its incumbent. In a similar fashion, Rick Jones, Monica Rambeau and Carol Danvers have all been Captain Marvel at different times, dumbass. Given the medical inaccuracy of their mown penises, it is not surprising that none of the stone-cold losers in Parliament Square on Tuesday understood this. As Trump touched down on Monday, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt described the decision by the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, to boycott Trump\u2019s banquet as \u201cvirtue signalling of the worst kind\u201d. Previously, the phrase \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d had been confined to the sticky pages of Spiked, or angry YouTube rants posted by involuntarily celibate 33-year-old men still living in their mothers\u2019 basements until Steve Bannon recognises their talents and gives them a job at Breitbart. It was good to see Jeremy Hunt introduce the phrase \u201cvirtue signalling\u201d into the mainstream, as it can only help elevate a national political discourse that is rapidly becoming unhelpfully polarised and terminally toxic. Perhaps Hunt can heal broken Britain. At his royal banquet, Trump paid tribute to the 24,000 British, American and Canadian troops that fought the Nazis in the D-day landings. But, having listened to the rhetoric of the preceding days, I had begun to wonder if the allied troops that plunged into those cold and foreboding French waters weren\u2019t just virtue-signallers of the worst kind themselves. They seem rather too keen to let us all know how much they disliked fascism. Led astray by that Marxist liberal elitist Winston Churchill, the allied troops of the D-day landings were unable to distinguish their dislike of Adolf Hitler from the institution of the chancellorship of Germany, which existed as an entity entirely separate from its incumbent, and deserved their respect. And there were, after all, probably \u201csome very fine people\u201d in the Nazi ranks. I am joking of course, and attempting to turn the values of Trump\u2019s apologists back on themselves, though one has to make this explicit in these irony-free days, where all comment is shorn of context and shat out into the shitosphere.

And I thought of Harry at Monday\u2019s events, hugging the tail end of Trump\u2019s train, like a dishonoured cuck, as the alt-right would say, absorbing the humiliation of his wife and mother, rained down by the visiting alpha male in a stinging golden shower. The prince, whose family has been forced to dine on the wrong side of history\u2019s table, was obediently impotent in service of the national interest, and a compliant pawn in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign.

      "body": "<p>A quiet Friday afternoon by London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Canal. Two dads who have known each other since they were 11 \u2013 they\u2019re now 39 \u2013 are having lunch without the kids. One is a smiling, broad-shouldered bear in a pink T-shirt. The other is smaller and bespectacled, hiding under a baseball cap. They look slightly hipsterish, but blend into the background seamlessly. A huge yellow bag and rucksack under the table contain their rather different outfits for later that day.</p> <p>Five hours later, Alexis Taylor is in front of thousands at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park, Hackney, his cap removed to reveal rainbow-coloured hair, a DayGlo lifejacket with holes around the nipples swaddling his body. Joe Goddard, meanwhile, is rocking back and forth behind a bank of synthesisers, wearing a colourful jacket with a pattern by artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/aug/19/jeremy-deller-cafes-pubs-endangered-species-political-art-gentrification\" title=\"\">Jeremy Deller</a> (also unfolded from the dad bags). Joining them are the rest of their crazily dressed band: guitarist Al Doyle in a linen tunic and trousers like a latterday apostle, brightly clothed multi-instrumentalist Owen Clarke, and synthesiser player Felix Martin smiling under his mop of madcap curls. Rob Smoughton (bass, congas, silvery beard, straw boater) and Leo Taylor (drums, lime-green top with pagan symbols) complete the live line-up.</p> <p>Behold Hot Chip, the greatest British pop group of their generation. They look like cartoon characters, and for their devoted fanbase, that\u2019s where their appeal begins. The band\u2019s music and image suggests a poppier, ravier version of Talking Heads. Gloriously ordinary weirdos, essentially, projecting their most extravagant selves on stage and video. Their fashion is the 21st-century equivalent of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Japanese jackets and Boy caps, and they have an art-school archness that is easy to appreciate, as their songs are never too serious, their live sets infused with humour.</p> <p>Their best songs, from 2006\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2CuSQHNMs\" title=\"\">Boy </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2CuSQHNMs\" title=\"\">from </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BK2CuSQHNMs\" title=\"\">School</a> to 2010\u2019s One Life Stand to their stunning new single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oUBqyz4q8\" title=\"\">Melody </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oUBqyz4q8\" title=\"\">of Love</a>, undercut playfulness with a heart-tugging melancholy. Taylor\u2019s voice \u2013 a high, pure peal in the tradition of Paul Heaton, Neil Tennant and Belle and Sebastian\u2019s Stuart Murdoch \u2013 is the heart, while Goddard\u2019s electronic wizardry provides their guts and pulse. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c620b0b2384cdcfde09486b3e7cf1c9b44641db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c620b0b2384cdcfde09486b3e7cf1c9b44641db4/0_141_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Al Doyle, Alexis Taylor of Hot Chip at All Points East festival, Victoria Park, east London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Al Doyle, Alexis Taylor and Felix Martin of Hot Chip at All Points East festival, Victoria Park, London, May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Burak \u00c7\u0131ng\u0131/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hot Chip are a strange modern success story: they\u2019ve become festival headliners while only ever having three top 40 hits. Since 2006\u2019s <em>The Warning</em><em>, </em>their breakthrough second album, tracks such as Over and Over (with its earwormy refrain: \u201clike a monkey with a miniature cymbal\u201d) have become ingrained in our pop consciousness, boosted by regular TV and soundtrack deals. Hot Chip\u2019s reputation as a brilliant live band has also helped, their music uniting old ravers and young (their top billing slot at 2015\u2019s Green Man was glorious; this year they headline Glastonbury\u2019s Park stage and the electronic <a href=\"https://www.discoverthebluedot.com/profile/hot-chip\" title=\"\">Bluedot </a><a href=\"https://www.discoverthebluedot.com/profile/hot-chip\" title=\"\">festival</a>).</p> <p>And they only get better. On 21 June, they will release their best, most commercial album yet: the provocatively titled <em>A Bath Full of Ecstasy</em>. The summer solstice release date is no coincidence: the typographic design and psychedelic colours of the cover art by Jeremy Deller and graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge (adapted into the band\u2019s stagewear by Cardiff designer <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/weareworkshy/\">Demi Amber</a>) suggests pagan rituals and the early days of rave. It\u2019s all a long way from the south London schoolyard where Taylor and Goddard first met in 1991...</p> <p>\u201cThe first pop culture we bonded over? Honestly? Football and WWF wrestling!\u201d</p> <p>Joe Goddard is great company: funny, interested, polite. Taylor is much quieter, but curiosity and warmth bubble through his conversation. The boys met at the now famous \u201cpop comp\u201d, Putney\u2019s Elliott school, whose other notable alumni include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/nov/23/burial-untrue\" title=\"\">Burial</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-xx\" title=\"\">xx</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/11/four-tet-alexandra-palace-london-review\" title=\"\">Four Tet</a>\u2019s Kieran Hebden, one of their early mentors (Goddard once got Hebden\u2019s university email disabled after sending him \u201cenormous sound files\u201d). The friends\u2019 first musical bonding moment was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/21/beastie-boys-book-memoir-interview\" title=\"\">Beastie Boys</a>, whom they watched on <em>The Word</em> (\u201cthey were incredibly charismatic and silly and fantastical, and that\u2019s what we wanted to be\u201d). Later, they got into alternative American singer-songwriters such as Smog\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/07/bill-callahan-smog-live-hoxton-hall-london\" title=\"\">Bill Callahan,</a> <a href=\"https://www.dragcity.com/artists/jim-orourke\" title=\"\">Jim O\u2019Rourke</a> and Will Oldham, who remains a big influence on Taylor. \u201cHe\u2019s so interesting and contrary, a great lyricist, and so prolific. It\u2019s funny: the music industry these days almost trains people to offer less stuff. I like challenging that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8oUBqyz4q8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O8oUBqyz4q8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/O8oUBqyz4q8\">Watch the video for Hot Chip\u2019s Melody of Love.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Their interest in pop culture was helped by their parents being arty, curious types. Taylor\u2019s father was a university English professor, his Greek mum a psychoanalyst (they divorced when he was young). Goddard\u2019s father was a film editor in Soho, which fascinated Joe, and Hot Chip\u2019s adventurous videos, such as the recent eight-minute short film for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOnMZALLQPk\" title=\"\">Hungry Child</a> in which a couple get possessed by the song, suggest a continuing interest. Goddard\u2019s parents would throw open their basement to their son\u2019s friends, including Clarke, on weekends, and after playing football on nearby fields, they\u2019d convene to learn songs, play guitars and use \u201creally rubbish, rudimentary\u201d computer programs to take loops off CDs.</p> <p>Then, in 1999, the pair went to university \u2013 Taylor to Cambridge to study English, Goddard to Oxford to study history \u2013 but their resolve to make music together set in. \u201cEverything was changing quite quickly at that point,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cJoe was getting into house and UK garage, I was listening constantly to Destiny\u2019s Child, but we still travelled to be together often and started trying to do our own weird take on the music that we liked.\u201d</p> <p>Hot Chip\u2019s first EP, <em>Mexico</em>, was released in 2001, \u201coutselling Eric Clapton\u2019s new release in Cambridge\u2019s Parrot Records on the day it came out,\u201d Taylor says, proudly.

This has included them doing lots of extracurricular music in the last decade: Taylor\u2019s jazz improv four-piece, About Group, and his and Goddard\u2019s solo albums have come out on the label too. Taylor was also one of the first signatories on the letter to save Radio 3\u2019s experimental programme <em>Late Junction</em> earlier this year. \u201cAn institution like that having platforms for interesting, diverse music is really important,\u201d he continues, \u201cwhether it\u2019s <em>Late Junction</em>, <em>Later With Jools Holland</em>, or the Maida Vale sessions.

When Hot Chip came back together, he knew a similar approach would enliven them. So instead of producing themselves, as they always did, they got in Philippe Zdar, of French dance duo Cassius, who went wild on the psychedelic effects (\u201cHe\u2019s got a bottle of acid in his fridge, actually,\u201d Goddard says). Xx producer Rodaidh McDonald was harsher. He pushed them to rewrite lyrics and edit song ideas drastically. \u201cWe signed up for it, though, so that\u2019s OK,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s thanks to him that Melody of Love is a big pop single rather than a 12-minute instrumental.\u201d</p> <p>He loved that idea of \u201cconnecting to people\u201d, he says.

One was having kids, which they did relatively young (Taylor was married in his early 20s and his daughter, Prudence, is 10; Goddard\u2019s daughter, Edie, is eight, his son, Albert, seven). \u201cParenthood teaches you a lot about your ego,\u201d says Goddard. \u201cHaving a sense of self-importance is crucial if you\u2019re in a band \u2013 that your ideas are important and need to be sung to people. Having kids battles that, makes you focus, and also makes time much more precious, which is a really wonderful thing. You can\u2019t have this wonderful spontaneous lifestyle of just being able to read the newspaper in a cafe for three hours on a Saturday morning any more. Instead, you\u2019re rocking your daughter because she will cry if she\u2019s put down, and you\u2019re thinking of the bassline and the beat you\u2019re going to work on. And when you do it, you make it special.\u201d</p> <p>But tragic events have affected them too, several around the release of 2015\u2019s <em>Why Make Sense?</em>. Schoolfriend and longtime collaborator Vincent Sipprell, a violinist, killed himself in January 2015; Taylor has said that the loss deeply influenced that record.</p> <p>Then, on 18 November, the band were due to play in Paris. Five days before, 90 people were killed at the Bataclan. The band had played there previously; they knew people directly affected by friends dying. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t want to do our gig if it seemed like the wrong message,\u201d Goddard says. But they played, and Al Doyle read a statement at the start of the gig that he had written in French. \u201cHe said that it\u2019s incredible how just playing a show becomes a political act after something like that happens. People thanked us for helping them to be able to be together as a group of people, enjoying something that they wanted to enjoy.\u201d He sits quietly for a moment. \u201cYou could see from the stage people who were dancing but also in tears. It was an incredibly moving experience, to be honest.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wrote the songs for people to bathe in, or be lost in in an active way</p> <footer> <cite>Alexis Taylor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>With that in mind, <em>A Bath Full of Ecstasy</em> feels like a record for our terrifying times. It takes the communal spirit of house and splices it with the DNA of pop: music as a conduit of hope. The band\u2019s image in 2019 \u2013 all sugary pastels and pure joy \u2013 is wrapped up in that feeling. We\u2019ve moved to a photo studio next door by this point, where the <em>Observer</em> pictures are done and dusted in half an hour, Taylor and Goddard changing in and out of their candy boilersuits like pros.</p> <p>\u201cI wrote the [new] songs for people to bathe in, or be lost in an active way,\u201d Taylor explains, as we order an Uber afterwards. \u201cTo have a deep listening experience with it, without any distractions, if they can.\u201d Both have railed before about how they dislike mindless escapism in pop. \u201cAnd escapism is the opposite of what we should be doing in our lives, for political and ecological reasons.\u201d</p> <p>They find the world around them frightening: Goddard regularly retweets anti-Trump and climate change messages. But Taylor would never write direct protest songs. \u201cRather than just saying, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Brexit and there\u2019s Trump in power\u2019, instead we\u2019ll write songs like Positive, which is about looking for positivity \u2013 asking people to support those around them suffering from mental health problems or facing difficulty with poverty or homelessness. I\u2019m thinking in songs instead, to try and figure out an answer.\u201d Mindful escapism, perhaps?</p> <p>In a way, <em>A Bath Full of Ecstasy</em> began life as a Katy Perry project. She had asked for Taylor and Goddard\u2019s services while making her 2017 album, <em>Witness</em>, and they spent four days in Air Studios together. \u201cIt was incredibly exciting,\u201d says Goddard, giddily. \u201cI loved writing for somebody else. She was great, very funny and easygoing, unlike the people around her. They\u2019d text: \u2018Katy\u2019s coming in 20 minutes\u2019, \u2018Katy\u2019s walking through the door\u2019, \u2018Katy\u2019s standing in front of you.\u2019\u201d One of these songs, Into Me You See, made it on to Perry\u2019s album; two others, Spell and Echo, have been reworked by Hot Chip for theirs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b1babecf02bc0726976035710588a42fc51386d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1babecf02bc0726976035710588a42fc51386d9/394_645_3575_4469/800.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Goddard and Alexis Taylor.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Gloriously ordinary weirdos\u2019: Joe Goddard (left) and Alexis Taylor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ellis Parrinder/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then came their own sessions \u2013 and that eyebrow-raising title. Surely it\u2019s not a midlife crisis drug-taking record? Goddard admits that he\u2019s been \u201cmicrodosing on mushrooms a bit, which is a bit zeitgeisty\u201d. Taylor revealed earlier this year in a <em>Q</em> interview that he has never taken ecstasy. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t meant to be a forceful thing. It wasn\u2019t an anti-drugs message. I mean, I haven\u2019t taken it.\u201d He looks at Goddard. \u201cBut everybody else in the band has.\u201d They both laugh.</p> <p>The title came from a line from a song they wrote early on, \u201cand it was just the most evocative and interesting and fun that endured, and just a bit of a break from too serious a title. And I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem to have a title that could be fun or playful or light-hearted in some ways. Ecstasy is just a nice thing to be talking about these days, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He stops. \u201cI mean, the actual feeling of ecstasy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd trying to present a kind of positivity in this world also feels like a valid contribution,\u201d Goddard says. \u201cIt\u2019s a worthwhile thing to do.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s now 3.15pm and we\u2019re standing outside a corner shop. Our Uber keeps getting cancelled. We hail a black cab in a hurry, piling in with the boys\u2019 costume bags on our knees (this doesn\u2019t happen to Katy Perry, I suggest). Goddard talks about the last time Hot Chip played Victoria Park in 2007. He had been DJing after a gig the previous night, finally falling asleep at 9am. He woke up at 5pm, just as the band were coming off stage. (Clarke had been with him too, although he made the last 20 minutes of the gig.) \u201cI can still remember the dread,\u201d Goddard shudders. Things are slightly different these days. Now he\u2019s planning family camping trips across Europe around the band\u2019s summer festivals.</p> <p>A few hours later, we\u2019re backstage ahead of the gig. Primal Scream, Little Simz and Kate Tempest are Hot Chip\u2019s neighbours. Among them is Hot Chip percussionist Rob Smoughton, who talks about the time Elton John invited all of Hot Chip backstage at a festival in California in 2015. \u201cHe was so knowledgeable about the band \u2013 he knew everything! \u2013 and was so bloody nice.\u201d</p> <p>Then comes Owen Clarke, recoiling when I mention Goddard\u2019s missed gig recollections (\u201coh God\u201d), Felix Martin and the cheerful Al Doyle, who confirms his position as the \u201cclassiest\u201d band member (Goddard\u2019s description) by telling me about a party he went to at former <em>Guardian</em> editor Alan Rusbridger\u2019s house and by making me a G&amp;T from their rider. An hour later, he\u2019s dressed in that tunic and wide trousers, joining his strange parade of bandmates to raise hell on the All Points East stage.</p> <p>The opening notes of Huarache Lights shimmer, and we\u2019re off. The set is fantastic, old and young singing along like total converts. Taylor drags a Leffe bottle over his guitar strings and bursts into laughter during Ready for the Floor when a refreshed teenager wearing a silver bumbag shouts its chorus line back to him (\u201cYou\u2019re my number one guy\u201d).</p> <p>And then comes something absurd and completely brilliant: Hot Chip cover Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage. Taylor shouts into two microphones, Goddard nearly rocks himself off the stage, everyone else going berserk. Twenty-seven years of friendship distilled into six minutes of euphoria and the spirit of a teenage basement transported to the open air. Hot Chip make us bathe in that feeling. And it\u2019s worthwhile.</p> <p><em>A Bath Full of Ecstasy is released by Domino on 21 June</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "A quiet Friday afternoon by London\u2019s Regent\u2019s Canal. Two dads who have known each other since they were 11 \u2013 they\u2019re now 39 \u2013 are having lunch without the kids. One is a smiling, broad-shouldered bear in a pink T-shirt. The other is smaller and bespectacled, hiding under a baseball cap. They look slightly hipsterish, but blend into the background seamlessly. A huge yellow bag and rucksack under the table contain their rather different outfits for later that day. Five hours later, Alexis Taylor is in front of thousands at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park, Hackney, his cap removed to reveal rainbow-coloured hair, a DayGlo lifejacket with holes around the nipples swaddling his body. Joe Goddard, meanwhile, is rocking back and forth behind a bank of synthesisers, wearing a colourful jacket with a pattern by artist Jeremy Deller (also unfolded from the dad bags). Joining them are the rest of their crazily dressed band: guitarist Al Doyle in a linen tunic and trousers like a latterday apostle, brightly clothed multi-instrumentalist Owen Clarke, and synthesiser player Felix Martin smiling under his mop of madcap curls. Rob Smoughton (bass, congas, silvery beard, straw boater) and Leo Taylor (drums, lime-green top with pagan symbols) complete the live line-up. Behold Hot Chip, the greatest British pop group of their generation. They look like cartoon characters, and for their devoted fanbase, that\u2019s where their appeal begins. The band\u2019s music and image suggests a poppier, ravier version of Talking Heads. Gloriously ordinary weirdos, essentially, projecting their most extravagant selves on stage and video. Their fashion is the 21st-century equivalent of the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 Japanese jackets and Boy caps, and they have an art-school archness that is easy to appreciate, as their songs are never too serious, their live sets infused with humour. Their best songs, from 2006\u2019s Boy from School to 2010\u2019s One Life Stand to their stunning new single, Melody of Love, undercut playfulness with a heart-tugging melancholy. Taylor\u2019s voice \u2013 a high, pure peal in the tradition of Paul Heaton, Neil Tennant and Belle and Sebastian\u2019s Stuart Murdoch \u2013 is the heart, while Goddard\u2019s electronic wizardry provides their guts and pulse. Hot Chip are a strange modern success story: they\u2019ve become festival headliners while only ever having three top 40 hits. Since 2006\u2019s The Warning, their breakthrough second album, tracks such as Over and Over (with its earwormy refrain: \u201clike a monkey with a miniature cymbal\u201d) have become ingrained in our pop consciousness, boosted by regular TV and soundtrack deals. Hot Chip\u2019s reputation as a brilliant live band has also helped, their music uniting old ravers and young (their top billing slot at 2015\u2019s Green Man was glorious; this year they headline Glastonbury\u2019s Park stage and the electronic Bluedot festival). And they only get better. On 21 June, they will release their best, most commercial album yet: the provocatively titled A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The summer solstice release date is no coincidence: the typographic design and psychedelic colours of the cover art by Jeremy Deller and graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge (adapted into the band\u2019s stagewear by Cardiff designer Demi Amber) suggests pagan rituals and the early days of rave. It\u2019s all a long way from the south London schoolyard where Taylor and Goddard first met in 1991... \u201cThe first pop culture we bonded over? Honestly? Football and WWF wrestling!\u201d Joe Goddard is great company: funny, interested, polite. Taylor is much quieter, but curiosity and warmth bubble through his conversation. The boys met at the now famous \u201cpop comp\u201d, Putney\u2019s Elliott school, whose other notable alumni include Burial, the xx and Four Tet\u2019s Kieran Hebden, one of their early mentors (Goddard once got Hebden\u2019s university email disabled after sending him \u201cenormous sound files\u201d). The friends\u2019 first musical bonding moment was Beastie Boys, whom they watched on The Word (\u201cthey were incredibly charismatic and silly and fantastical, and that\u2019s what we wanted to be\u201d). Later, they got into alternative American singer-songwriters such as Smog\u2019s Bill Callahan, Jim O\u2019Rourke and Will Oldham, who remains a big influence on Taylor. \u201cHe\u2019s so interesting and contrary, a great lyricist, and so prolific. It\u2019s funny: the music industry these days almost trains people to offer less stuff. I like challenging that.\u201d Their interest in pop culture was helped by their parents being arty, curious types. Taylor\u2019s father was a university English professor, his Greek mum a psychoanalyst (they divorced when he was young). Goddard\u2019s father was a film editor in Soho, which fascinated Joe, and Hot Chip\u2019s adventurous videos, such as the recent eight-minute short film for Hungry Child in which a couple get possessed by the song, suggest a continuing interest. Goddard\u2019s parents would throw open their basement to their son\u2019s friends, including Clarke, on weekends, and after playing football on nearby fields, they\u2019d convene to learn songs, play guitars and use \u201creally rubbish, rudimentary\u201d computer programs to take loops off CDs. Then, in 1999, the pair went to university \u2013 Taylor to Cambridge to study English, Goddard to Oxford to study history \u2013 but their resolve to make music together set in. \u201cEverything was changing quite quickly at that point,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cJoe was getting into house and UK garage, I was listening constantly to Destiny\u2019s Child, but we still travelled to be together often and started trying to do our own weird take on the music that we liked.\u201d Hot Chip\u2019s first EP, Mexico, was released in 2001, \u201coutselling Eric Clapton\u2019s new release in Cambridge\u2019s Parrot Records on the day it came out,\u201d Taylor says, proudly. Another EP, Sanfrandisco, followed in October 2002, after the friends had graduated. By this point, Goddard was a marketing assistant at Island Records (\u201cI worked on the first Keane album!\u201d), and soon after heard the EP playing in the office of A&amp;R Stephen Bass, who also ran indie label Moshi Moshi. In 2004, Bass released their first album, Coming on Strong. By the time of its follow-up, The Warning, Hot Chip had signed to EMI and were everywhere: popping up on TV background tracks, getting a Mercury nomination and being sent on huge tours. \u201cWe were a sales priority! Not that that lasted,\u201d says Goddard. \u201cWe went on this semi-amazing, semi-crazy trip across Spain and Portugal, being shipped from festival to festival in this coach in boiling heat \u2013 but the air conditioning was broken. We were all, \u2018Yeah, we\u2019re the new music business thing, guys!\u201d 2008\u2019s Ready for the Floor remains their only Top 10 single (No 6). \u201cI loved that moment,\u201d Taylor says. Does he mind not having had any more? \u201cIt\u2019d be nice, but it\u2019s not that I\u2019m studying the charts, desperate to get in.\u201d He laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about this without sounding ancient and miserable but the best pop, in my mind, is imaginative, immediate and accessible \u2013 but also challenging.

This has included them doing lots of extracurricular music in the last decade: Taylor\u2019s jazz improv four-piece, About Group, and his and Goddard\u2019s solo albums have come out on the label too.

It underlines that creativity is worth paying attention to.\u201d The spirit of collaboration with others has changed them, they say \u2013 and it\u2019s the same for Al Doyle, who joined LCD Soundsystem live in 2007, before co-writing seven tracks on their 2017 album, American Dream (\u201cAl\u2019s in James Murphy\u2019s classy world now,\u201d Goddard smiles). Taylor\u2019s 2017 Listen With(out) Piano project also saw him giving songs over completely to other people to finish, among them Green Gartside and Royal Trux\u2019s Jennifer Herrema. When Hot Chip came back together, he knew a similar approach would enliven them. So instead of producing themselves, as they always did, they got in Philippe Zdar, of French dance duo Cassius, who went wild on the psychedelic effects (\u201cHe\u2019s got a bottle of acid in his fridge, actually,\u201d Goddard says).

You can\u2019t have this wonderful spontaneous lifestyle of just being able to read the newspaper in a cafe for three hours on a Saturday morning any more. Instead, you\u2019re rocking your daughter because she will cry if she\u2019s put down, and you\u2019re thinking of the bassline and the beat you\u2019re going to work on. And when you do it, you make it special.\u201d But tragic events have affected them too, several around the release of 2015\u2019s Why Make Sense?. Schoolfriend and longtime collaborator Vincent Sipprell, a violinist, killed himself in January 2015; Taylor has said that the loss deeply influenced that record. Then, on 18 November, the band were due to play in Paris. Five days before, 90 people were killed at the Bataclan. The band had played there previously; they knew people directly affected by friends dying. \u201cWe really didn\u2019t want to do our gig if it seemed like the wrong message,\u201d Goddard says. But they played, and Al Doyle read a statement at the start of the gig that he had written in French. \u201cHe said that it\u2019s incredible how just playing a show becomes a political act after something like that happens. People thanked us for helping them to be able to be together as a group of people, enjoying something that they wanted to enjoy.\u201d He sits quietly for a moment. \u201cYou could see from the stage people who were dancing but also in tears. It was an incredibly moving experience, to be honest.\u201d With that in mind, A Bath Full of Ecstasy feels like a record for our terrifying times. It takes the communal spirit of house and splices it with the DNA of pop: music as a conduit of hope. The band\u2019s image in 2019 \u2013 all sugary pastels and pure joy \u2013 is wrapped up in that feeling. We\u2019ve moved to a photo studio next door by this point, where the Observer pictures are done and dusted in half an hour, Taylor and Goddard changing in and out of their candy boilersuits like pros. \u201cI wrote the [new] songs for people to bathe in, or be lost in an active way,\u201d Taylor explains, as we order an Uber afterwards. \u201cTo have a deep listening experience with it, without any distractions, if they can.\u201d Both have railed before about how they dislike mindless escapism in pop. \u201cAnd escapism is the opposite of what we should be doing in our lives, for political and ecological reasons.\u201d They find the world around them frightening: Goddard regularly retweets anti-Trump and climate change messages. But Taylor would never write direct protest songs. \u201cRather than just saying, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Brexit and there\u2019s Trump in power\u2019, instead we\u2019ll write songs like Positive, which is about looking for positivity \u2013 asking people to support those around them suffering from mental health problems or facing difficulty with poverty or homelessness. I\u2019m thinking in songs instead, to try and figure out an answer.\u201d Mindful escapism, perhaps? In a way, A Bath Full of Ecstasy began life as a Katy Perry project. She had asked for Taylor and Goddard\u2019s services while making her 2017 album, Witness, and they spent four days in Air Studios together. \u201cIt was incredibly exciting,\u201d says Goddard, giddily. \u201cI loved writing for somebody else. She was great, very funny and easygoing, unlike the people around her. They\u2019d text: \u2018Katy\u2019s coming in 20 minutes\u2019, \u2018Katy\u2019s walking through the door\u2019, \u2018Katy\u2019s standing in front of you.\u2019\u201d One of these songs, Into Me You See, made it on to Perry\u2019s album; two others, Spell and Echo, have been reworked by Hot Chip for theirs. Then came their own sessions \u2013 and that eyebrow-raising title. Surely it\u2019s not a midlife crisis drug-taking record? Goddard admits that he\u2019s been \u201cmicrodosing on mushrooms a bit, which is a bit zeitgeisty\u201d. Taylor revealed earlier this year in a Q interview that he has never taken ecstasy. \u201cBut that wasn\u2019t meant to be a forceful thing. It wasn\u2019t an anti-drugs message. I mean, I haven\u2019t taken it.\u201d He looks at Goddard. \u201cBut everybody else in the band has.\u201d They both laugh. The title came from a line from a song they wrote early on, \u201cand it was just the most evocative and interesting and fun that endured, and just a bit of a break from too serious a title. And I didn\u2019t think it\u2019s a problem to have a title that could be fun or playful or light-hearted in some ways. Ecstasy is just a nice thing to be talking about these days, isn\u2019t it?\u201d He stops. \u201cI mean, the actual feeling of ecstasy.\u201d \u201cAnd trying to present a kind of positivity in this world also feels like a valid contribution,\u201d Goddard says. \u201cIt\u2019s a worthwhile thing to do.\u201d It\u2019s now 3.15pm and we\u2019re standing outside a corner shop. Our Uber keeps getting cancelled. We hail a black cab in a hurry, piling in with the boys\u2019 costume bags on our knees (this doesn\u2019t happen to Katy Perry, I suggest). Goddard talks about the last time Hot Chip played Victoria Park in 2007. He had been DJing after a gig the previous night, finally falling asleep at 9am. He woke up at 5pm, just as the band were coming off stage. (Clarke had been with him too, although he made the last 20 minutes of the gig.) \u201cI can still remember the dread,\u201d Goddard shudders. Things are slightly different these days. Now he\u2019s planning family camping trips across Europe around the band\u2019s summer festivals. A few hours later, we\u2019re backstage ahead of the gig. Primal Scream, Little Simz and Kate Tempest are Hot Chip\u2019s neighbours. Among them is Hot Chip percussionist Rob Smoughton, who talks about the time Elton John invited all of Hot Chip backstage at a festival in California in 2015. \u201cHe was so knowledgeable about the band \u2013 he knew everything! \u2013 and was so bloody nice.\u201d Then comes Owen Clarke, recoiling when I mention Goddard\u2019s missed gig recollections (\u201coh God\u201d), Felix Martin and the cheerful Al Doyle, who confirms his position as the \u201cclassiest\u201d band member (Goddard\u2019s description) by telling me about a party he went to at former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger\u2019s house and by making me a G&amp;T from their rider. An hour later, he\u2019s dressed in that tunic and wide trousers, joining his strange parade of bandmates to raise hell on the All Points East stage. The opening notes of Huarache Lights shimmer, and we\u2019re off. The set is fantastic, old and young singing along like total converts. Taylor drags a Leffe bottle over his guitar strings and bursts into laughter during Ready for the Floor when a refreshed teenager wearing a silver bumbag shouts its chorus line back to him (\u201cYou\u2019re my number one guy\u201d). And then comes something absurd and completely brilliant: Hot Chip cover Beastie Boys\u2019 Sabotage. Taylor shouts into two microphones, Goddard nearly rocks himself off the stage, everyone else going berserk. Twenty-seven years of friendship distilled into six minutes of euphoria and the spirit of a teenage basement transported to the open air. Hot Chip make us bathe in that feeling. And it\u2019s worthwhile. A Bath Full of Ecstasy is released by Domino on 21 June",

There are risks involved with contracting players who might see little time on the field, but I think I speak for every Sixers fan when I say that having Steve Smith back in the magenta would be the making of a magical summer.</p> <p>From AAP:</p> <p><strong>BBL teams weigh up big-name contracts</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2ae866d9abf4aff7cc7480f0616adeeeac529e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2ae866d9abf4aff7cc7480f0616adeeeac529e/0_536_3963_2379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Smith batting at the Cricket World Cup.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steve Smith will be highly sought after by BBL franchises if the draw allows.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alan Martin/Action Plus via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Big Bash League teams are weighing up whether to offer contracts to Australia\u2019s international stars as the hopes of a mass return hang in the balance. A fractured home summer, which includes a month-long international gap between tours of India and South Africa in January and February, had shaped as an opportunity to return big names to the competition.</p> <p>BBL teams were last week given their first look at the draft draw, although the release of the final schedule is still expected to be some time off. Steve Smith is understood to be one of those players waiting on its release, with the Sydney Sixers keen to secure the former national captain\u2019s return. Smith has not played in the Big Bash since 2014 but would be an asset on and off the field for the Sixers. </p> <p>While he would likely be considered a risk-free option, the situation is far more tricky for BBL sides when it comes to Australia\u2019s trio of fast bowlers. There is a thought from some that there is no guarantee they\u2019ll be available to play enough games, depending on if they are rested after the five-Test summer and Indian one-dayers.</p> <p>Pat Cummins is off-contract at the Sydney Thunder and at this stage could go unsigned. The right-arm quick has played just one match in the past two seasons for the Thunder, after returning to fitness and representing Australia in all three formats. Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc haven\u2019t featured in the BBL since 2014, tied up across all three of Australia\u2019s international sides. Starc has acted as an ambassador for the Sixers in recent seasons and the franchise could return both the quicks to the field if the schedule is friendly to the idea.</p> <p>Meanwhile, David Warner has previously been linked to the Melbourne Stars but he appears far less likely than Smith to play in the competition. The only other regular member of Australia\u2019s red and white-ball sides, Usman Khawaja, was re-signed by the Thunder until the end of the 2019-20 season two years ago.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfc9ebd8f084466bb196558\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T05:57:48.719Z\">6.57am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">NRL: Broncos 18-26 Titans</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Despite two late tries from the Broncos, the Titans managed to hold on to get the win over their more fancied neighbours.

What broadcasters will hope to avoid is a situation like in the Commonwealth Games gold medal match in Delhi in 2010 where play continued for 84 minutes (instead of the usual 60) until a result was reached. However with four draws from the first seven rounds of the competition fans, players, coaches and commentators are all demanding action, so expect a compromise to be reached for the 2020 season.</p> <p>From AAP:</p> <p><strong>Fever coach wants Super Netball extra time</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6887ef01c7d947cf341f84fb116fe879b4e380ef\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6887ef01c7d947cf341f84fb116fe879b4e380ef/0_166_4300_2581/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Marinkovich pointing while coaching the Fever.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fever head coach Stacey Marinkovich hopes draws will soon be a thing of the past in Super Netball.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Day/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be strange if you didn\u2019t want extra time when you have had three draws in your past four matches but West Coast Fever coach Stacey Marinkovich believes it should be the next step forward for Super Netball. <br></p> <p>The Fever fought back to share the spoils with the Giants on Saturday night after a 62-all draw at RAC Arena. While the Fever did well to come from behind in home draws with Melbourne Vixens and the Giants, Marinkovich would prefer an outright match winner.</p> <p>\u201cI think it would be good to play to a result,\u201d she said. \u201cThe players have the capacities to keep running it out and that\u2019s why you have a bench, to be able to make those rotations. But that\u2019s what the competition is at the moment and you still have the bonus points to play for, so for us to walk away with four points is lucky in some regards.\u201d</p> <p>The three draws could cost last year\u2019s grand final hosts a finals berth given they are 11 points behind the fourth-placed Giants. But Marinkovich is happy with West Coast\u2019s response to losing the first three games with three draws and a win from the past four, including games in Bendigo and Brisbane before Saturday night.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chance they could end up hurting us but we just have to keep taking the learnings from them and make sure we come out firing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew that this was a big stint of the competition for us but sometimes until you are actually in it you don\u2019t realise how taxing it can be.</p> <p>\u201cTravel will never be an excuse for us, even though we certainly don\u2019t like double-headers on the road given how much more travel we do than any other team.\u201d<br></p> <p>Fever continue to be penalised heavily for their admittedly physical approach and while Marinkovich likes the way her team plays she knows they need to adjust during games.<br></p> <p>\u201cI think we play hard for the contest, we just have to make sure we are in the line of the ball and we have to show the umpires where we\u2019re coming from as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have those discussions which is great that we can have between umpires and coaches.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5cfc98ec8f08ff012e270f68\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-06-09T05:31:58.760Z\">6.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Women\u2019s World Cup: </strong>Speaking of the Matildas, Richard Parkin has set the scene brilliantly for us going into their opening match against Italy tonight.

      "bodyText": "Well that wraps up the domestic sport for today. But don\u2019t go anywhere, we\u2019re about to kick off our live blogs for the Matildas game in the Women\u2019s World Cup, as well as the big Australia v India match in the Cricket World Cup. Later tonight we\u2019ll also be live blogging the men\u2019s French Open singles final and Brazil v Jamaica in the Women\u2019s World Cup. Now is probably a good time to make your dinner, get your snacks organised and settle in for another big night of sport. Cheer well and I\u2019ll see you on the other side. A double from Viliame Kikau has sealed the deal for the Panthers against the Roosters. It was the second game today where a cellar dweller has stepped up against their much higher ranked opposition. The Panthers took full advantage of a depleted Roosters team, continually forcing them to play deep in their own half. A field goal to James Maloney in the dying minutes sealed the game for the home team and their desperation in defence throughout the game was a highlight. It was the game everyone has been waiting for from the Sydney Swans as the young guns stepped up and Buddy Franklin fired up with five goals, including a sensational effort right on full time. For the Eagles, Josh Kennedy was unable to add to his total in the second half, due to a great defensive effort by the home team. Franklin was visibly delighted after the game. \u201cIt was nice to kick that,\u201d he said of his last minute goal. \u201cReward for a little bit of effort. What a win! It really was a team effort, we were down three on the interchange, so we knew we had to grind out a win. It was huge, it really took a lot of ticker.\u201d If you\u2019re in Melbourne during June, check out this great exhibition of photography of some of Australia\u2019s incredible female athletes. Opening on Tuesday in the CBD, this initiative of Women\u2019s Sport Australia got some fantastic entries. Tennis: A lovely thread from German tennis star Andrea Petkovic last week on what makes her sport special is doing the rounds on Twitter. Well worth a reflection after last night\u2019s big win from Ash Barty. Women\u2019s World Cup: Also overnight Germany got their World Cup campaign off to a good start with a 1-0 defeat of China. Teenage debutante Giulia Gwinn was the one to break the deadlock in the 66th minute. You can read all about it here: Women\u2019s World Cup: A big result for the Norwegian team overnight, defeating Nigeria 3-0, even without star Aga Hegerberg, who will not play international football for her country following a feud with the Norwegian governing body over the treatment of women\u2019s football. Her team managed to stand strong and come up with a convincing win in her absence. Cricket World Cup: It\u2019s going to be another big night for sports fans with the Matildas kicking off their World Cup campaign as well as the cricketers coming up against old foes India. We\u2019ve got some great reporters on the ground covering it - they\u2019ll be live blogging the game tonight, but in the meantime check out Geoff Lemon\u2019s fantastic article about surprise hero Nathan Coulter-Nile. NRL: Half-time at Penrith and the Panthers lead the Roosters 6-4 in a scrappy affair. The Panthers scored early, with Viliame Kikau crossing in just the second minute of the game. It took until the 27th minute for the Roosters to trouble the scorer and the remainder of the half was a defensive battle. A penalty 20 metres out gave the Roosters the chance to equalise right before the end of the half, but Siosiua Taukeiaho hit the post with his attempt at goal. State of Origin: The fully-booted Queenslanders were too good for NSW this week, proving that you could pretty much pop a maroon jumper on a herd of cows, providing they were from Queensland, and they\u2019d find a way to win. Matt Cleary wrote this great article during the week about how Kevin Walters and his team achieved a feat that many thought impossible. AFL: A great first half for the Swans has them leading the Eagles 9.6 (60) to 6.3 (39) at half-time. An incredible half of football from Buddy Franklin has sparked the Swans, who are playing with passion and desperation they haven\u2019t shown for some time. In the battle of the big forwards, Franklin and Josh Kennedy have each kicked three goals and both will look to rack up their tallies further in the second half. Rugby league: A great story from out of the UK on Jodie Cunningham, who is not only playing rugby league for St Helens and England, but also working as a pundit on Sky\u2019s coverage of the Super League. Women\u2019s sport in the UK is going through a huge surge at the moment and hopefully the rise of women\u2019s rugby league continues. Golf: A fascinating interview with Thomas Bj\u00f8rn this week, talking about the dark side of sport - depression and other mental illnesses. It\u2019s only relatively recently that this is being spoken about, but it\u2019s likely that mental health, along with concussion, will be one of the biggest issues that will need to be addressed over the next few years to ensure we take care of athletes at their most vulnerable. Cricket: While we\u2019re all caught up in World Cup fever at the moment, an interesting development is happening back at home, with a scheduling quirk for the summer leaving Big Bash League franchises wondering what to do about contracting some of Australia\u2019s international stars. There are risks involved with contracting players who might see little time on the field, but I think I speak for every Sixers fan when I say that having Steve Smith back in the magenta would be the making of a magical summer. From AAP: BBL teams weigh up big-name contracts Big Bash League teams are weighing up whether to offer contracts to Australia\u2019s international stars as the hopes of a mass return hang in the balance. A fractured home summer, which includes a month-long international gap between tours of India and South Africa in January and February, had shaped as an opportunity to return big names to the competition. BBL teams were last week given their first look at the draft draw, although the release of the final schedule is still expected to be some time off. Steve Smith is understood to be one of those players waiting on its release, with the Sydney Sixers keen to secure the former national captain\u2019s return. Smith has not played in the Big Bash since 2014 but would be an asset on and off the field for the Sixers. While he would likely be considered a risk-free option, the situation is far more tricky for BBL sides when it comes to Australia\u2019s trio of fast bowlers. There is a thought from some that there is no guarantee they\u2019ll be available to play enough games, depending on if they are rested after the five-Test summer and Indian one-dayers. Pat Cummins is off-contract at the Sydney Thunder and at this stage could go unsigned. The right-arm quick has played just one match in the past two seasons for the Thunder, after returning to fitness and representing Australia in all three formats. Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc haven\u2019t featured in the BBL since 2014, tied up across all three of Australia\u2019s international sides. Starc has acted as an ambassador for the Sixers in recent seasons and the franchise could return both the quicks to the field if the schedule is friendly to the idea. Meanwhile, David Warner has previously been linked to the Melbourne Stars but he appears far less likely than Smith to play in the competition. The only other regular member of Australia\u2019s red and white-ball sides, Usman Khawaja, was re-signed by the Thunder until the end of the 2019-20 season two years ago. Despite two late tries from the Broncos, the Titans managed to hold on to get the win over their more fancied neighbours. This time of year is always tricky for teams with State of Origin forcing changes and players backing up from a high intensity game just days earlier. However the Titans were able to take advantage of their opportunity to play the Broncos during this period and deserve all the credit for pushing their advantage and coming away with the win. Super Netball: After the third draw in four games for the West Coast Fever, it\u2019s unsurprising that their coach Stacey Marinkovich has added her voice to the chorus of people calling for extra time in the game. What broadcasters will hope to avoid is a situation like in the Commonwealth Games gold medal match in Delhi in 2010 where play continued for 84 minutes (instead of the usual 60) until a result was reached. However with four draws from the first seven rounds of the competition fans, players, coaches and commentators are all demanding action, so expect a compromise to be reached for the 2020 season. From AAP: Fever coach wants Super Netball extra time It would be strange if you didn\u2019t want extra time when you have had three draws in your past four matches but West Coast Fever coach Stacey Marinkovich believes it should be the next step forward for Super Netball. The Fever fought back to share the spoils with the Giants on Saturday night after a 62-all draw at RAC Arena. While the Fever did well to come from behind in home draws with Melbourne Vixens and the Giants, Marinkovich would prefer an outright match winner. \u201cI think it would be good to play to a result,\u201d she said. \u201cThe players have the capacities to keep running it out and that\u2019s why you have a bench, to be able to make those rotations. But that\u2019s what the competition is at the moment and you still have the bonus points to play for, so for us to walk away with four points is lucky in some regards.\u201d The three draws could cost last year\u2019s grand final hosts a finals berth given they are 11 points behind the fourth-placed Giants. But Marinkovich is happy with West Coast\u2019s response to losing the first three games with three draws and a win from the past four, including games in Bendigo and Brisbane before Saturday night. \u201cThere\u2019s a chance they could end up hurting us but we just have to keep taking the learnings from them and make sure we come out firing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe knew that this was a big stint of the competition for us but sometimes until you are actually in it you don\u2019t realise how taxing it can be. \u201cTravel will never be an excuse for us, even though we certainly don\u2019t like double-headers on the road given how much more travel we do than any other team.\u201d Fever continue to be penalised heavily for their admittedly physical approach and while Marinkovich likes the way her team plays she knows they need to adjust during games. \u201cI think we play hard for the contest, we just have to make sure we are in the line of the ball and we have to show the umpires where we\u2019re coming from as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have those discussions which is great that we can have between umpires and coaches.\u201d Women\u2019s World Cup: Speaking of the Matildas, Richard Parkin has set the scene brilliantly for us going into their opening match against Italy tonight. Midfielder Elise Kellond-Knight believes it\u2019s now or never for the Australians as international women\u2019s football continues to improve and the pool of contenders for the World Cup title increases. Women\u2019s World Cup: If you\u2019re starting to get excited about the Matildas\u2019 first game in the World Cup tonight, check out how the South African team arrived to their game last night. Absolutely nailed it. Unfortunately they didn\u2019t quite nail the result, going down to Spain 1-3. After a close game and a yet another draw yesterday this game lacked some of the excitement, but unfortunately had its fair share of drama, with Swifts\u2019 captain Maddy Proud going down with what looks to be a serious knee injury. In a season marred with injury, it\u2019s tough to see, especially from the ladder leaders who are having such a strong season after failing to qualify for finals in their first two years. The Swifts were visibly shaken at the end of the game, tears flowing from most players, while MVP Sarah Klau struggled to keep composure during her post-match interview with Laura Geitz. \u201cObviously it was very challenging, we never like to see teammates getting injured,\u201d she said. \u201cBut for us, we just needed to focus on what we had to do on court so I think the girls did well.\u201d Klau was also happy with the defensive effort of her team, which she said is consistent all the way down the court. \u201cI think defensive effort really starts from the attack end in transition, so a credit to the girls in front of me,\u201d she said \u201cI thought they really gave it to the Firebirds today, so massive credit to them.\u201d The Swifts took three bonus points for the match, with the Firebirds able to take the final quarter by one goal to salvage a bit of consolation. NRL: Half-time in Brisbane and it\u2019s the Gold Coast Titans leading in the local derby against the Broncos, up 18-6. Tyrone Roberts has been the star for the visitors, with a try and three conversions to his name so far. A win today would be a much needed confidence boost for the Titans who are languishing at the bottom of the ladder, only ahead of the Bulldogs on points differential. French Open: The other great story out of Roland Garros last night was Dylan Alcott taking out the first ever wheelchair quad singles at the event. Alcott is now on track to equal a stunning Rod Laver feat. AFL: Nice to read about the statue of Nicky Winmar in the works at Optus Stadium in Perth. It\u2019s been two years in the making, but is finally on its way to being unveiled in July. Super Rugby: It hasn\u2019t been much fun for most of the Australian Super Rugby teams this year - it certainly doesn\u2019t seem like the elimination of the Western Force from the competition has done much to ease the depth problems that persist in Australian rugby circles. With more and more of the traditional rugby base - private boys\u2019 schools in Sydney and Brisbane - embracing AFL, it doesn\u2019t seem like a trend that\u2019s likely to reverse any time soon. Meanwhile it\u2019s good news for the Brumbies, who won their fifth consecutive match last night, defeating old rivals the Waratahs by 11 points. That means they will definitely qualify for the finals and can start preparing. Here are the chances of the other Australian teams from AAP: 1 - BRUMBIES (4th overall v Queensland Reds in Canberra on Saturday) With the Australian conference wrapped up, a home quarter-final is certain regardless of the result. 2 - MELBOURNE REBELS (8th v Chiefs in Melbourne on Friday) Victory guarantees a maiden finals appearance. Defeat means the opposite unless they bag a bonus point. Even then they\u2019d be a long shot. 3 - NSW WARATAHS (12th v Highlanders in Invercargill on Friday) Slim mathematical chance only. Must nab a bonus point win in the round\u2019s opening match and hope other results fall their way. 4 - QUEENSLAND REDS (14th v Brumbies in Canberra on Saturday) No shot at the finals. A win or draw could see them improve on last year\u2019s second-last placing overall. French Open: Of course the biggest story out of last night was Ash Barty\u2019s first grand slam win, taking out the French Open. After numerous delays due to rain and the men\u2019s semi-final overstaying its welcome, Barty made short work of it, winning in straight sets and bestowing the gift of a decent night\u2019s sleep on her fans back here in Australia. If you couldn\u2019t stay awake for it, Simon Cambers wrote this wonderful article that encapsulates Barty\u2019s character and spirit so well. State of Origin: And while we\u2019re on Queensland v NSW battles, some interesting news out of the Blues camp as Brad Fittler confirms he has spoken with officials over the bizarre boot throwing incident from Wednesday night\u2019s game. I can only hope this tactic spreads far and wide before the rules catch up and we get to see some barefoot rugby league played while the crowd rushes around madly trying to match up pairs of boots to take home, like some incredibly bizarre version of Memory. From AAP: NSW coach Brad Fittler admits seeking the referees boss over a boot-throwing incident that went overlooked in game one of State of Origin. Fittler claimed Blues skipper Boyd Cordner played six second-half minutes without a boot after Ben Hunt ripped it off his foot and threw it over the sideline. At one stage, Cordner even kicked the ball with his bootless left foot after finding himself with the ball on the fifth tackle. The incident prompted an annoyed Fittler to broach the topic with the game\u2019s officials, who initially giggled in response. \u201cI spoke to the referees boss and he giggled and I said, \u2018Well I\u2019m going to now coach my players to do it\u2019,\u201d Fittler said on The Sunday Footy Show. \u201cAnd all of a sudden he went, \u2018You know what, we need to do something about this. There needs to be something written in\u2019. \u201cYou just can\u2019t have people slipping around on the field and you can\u2019t have people throwing boots off into the crowd. Simple as that.\u201d Super Netball: The Queensland Firebirds haven\u2019t been able to stem the flow of their southern rivals the NSW Swifts, trailing 21-34 at the break. Despite adding some extra firepower with imports Lenize Potgieter and Erin Burger (both from South Africa) to replace the injured Romelda Aiken and Mahalia Cassidy, the Firebirds have struggled to stay with the Swifts during the first half. Impressive defence from new Diamond Sarah Klau and accurate shooting from Sam Wallace and Helen Housby have been a highlight of the visitors\u2019 game so far. Well what a night of sport we had! They could remake \u2018While You Were Sleeping\u2019 based entirely on that one night of sport from Europe. Between Ash Barty, Dylan Alcott, the Women\u2019s World Cup and the Cricket World Cup, I hope everyone had a well-deserved sleep in this morning and are ready to do it all again tonight. My commiserations to the Queenslanders who will have to suffer through without a public holiday tomorrow, but for everyone else, I hope you\u2019re well rested and ready for another huge night. Let\u2019s kick it off!",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThe art of music above all other arts,\u201d said Ralph Vaughan Williams, \u201cis the expression of the soul of a nation \u2013 any community of people who are spiritually bound together by language, environment, history and common ideals and, above all, a continuity with the past.\u201d</p> <p>Vaughan Williams\u2019s remarks about the formation of national and individual identity lie at the heart of Richard King\u2019s new study of the connections between music and the natural world. Beginning with \u201cthe psychologically altered green fields of England [that] Vaughan Williams and the generation returning from the trenches encountered after the armistice\u201d, King sets out to chronicle, over roughly the course of a century, the ways in which the English countryside and character have been shaped and reimagined by forces social, political, economic and, above all, artistic.</p> <p>In doing so, he embarks on a meandering, associative and highly idiosyncratic trip on which he reflects on the agrarian revivalists and utopians of the 1920s and 1930s; the form that rural Britain would take as the nation was rebuilt in the wake of the second world war; the \u201cback to the land\u201d movement of the 1960s; and the alterations to our understanding of the countryside that occurred during the 1980s, exemplified most notably by the spectacle of new age travellers assembling annually at Stonehenge, and by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/mar/20/greenham-common-nuclear-silos-women-protest-peace-camp\" title=\"\">women\u2019s peace camp</a> gathering outside the fence at Greenham Common to demonstrate against cruise missiles.</p> <p>The expedition ends with an extended meditation on the significance of the rave culture that flourished in England in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focusing most concertedly on the seven-day (illegal and law-changing) party that took place at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/castlemorton-triggers-rave-crackdown\" title=\"\">Castlemorton Common in 1992</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/aug/09/richard-king-listening-to-records-original-rockers\">Richard King: 'I was once more overwhelmed by the act of listening to records'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>King, a bestselling cultural historian whose previous works include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/04/how-soon-is-now-richard-king-review\" title=\"\"><em>How Soon Is Now?</em></a> (a study of the development of independent music) and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/19/original-rockers-richard-king-review-bristol-record-shop-revolver-massive-attack\" title=\"\"><em>Original Rockers</em></a> (an account of the years King spent working at Bristol\u2019s Revolver Records), approaches these phenomena by attending to the ways in which they were shaped by and accommodated within the history of 20th-century music. Why music? Because, for King, \u201cfrom the song written to commemorate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/apr/17/kinder-scout-mass-trespass-anniversary\" title=\"\">the mass trespass of Kinder Scout</a> [in 1932] to the moment before the sound systems of the free festivals finally ran out of charge, music was the thread of this activity and flowed through the country like a river\u201d.</p> <p>In an effort to substantiate this claim, King draws on a series of \u201cheadphone walks\u201d (perambulations on which he listens to music) and an assortment of interviews he has conducted with an array of rural enthusiasts, film-makers and musicians, thinking along the way about the bucolic significance of Kate Bush, Brian Eno, Boards of Canada and Vaughan Williams, whose most popular composition, The Lark Ascending, \u201ccreated the musical equivalent of a British landscape open to \u2018every community\u2019\u201d and is of inestimable importance when it comes to understanding the lineaments of British life. Or so King argues.</p> <p>The resulting work is a peculiarly frustrating affair and most of the frustration is generated by King\u2019s insistence that music be recognised as the defining impetus behind, and register of, the changes he describes. The association between music and landscape may, as he rather grandly puts it, feel at times \u201calmost divine\u201d, but it is also \u201can eternal association that resists analysis\u201d. And, one might add, verification: almost nothing King says about the pastoral resonance of music moves beyond a kind of nebulous speculation. This, as he himself concedes, can be \u201cexasperating\u201d and contributes to a sense that his book as a whole eddies rather than builds.</p> <p>Often, the most engaging and enjoyable moments of <em>The Lark Ascending</em> occur when King is not discussing music at all. There is a lovely episode, for example, in which we learn of the environmental activists known as <a href=\"https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/features/who-were-fergusons-gang\" title=\"\">Ferguson\u2019s Gang</a>, a group of five or six anonymous women who in the late 1920s aimed to support the activities of the National Trust by delivering to the organisation substantial donations \u201celaborately sewn into the carcass of a goose\u201d.</p> <p>But such moments are rare and do little to alleviate the impression that, on closing this book about the elevating reciprocity of music and nature, you have been on a journey that has dishearteningly failed to take flight.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>The Lark Ascending</em> by Richard King is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "\u201cThe art of music above all other arts,\u201d said Ralph Vaughan Williams, \u201cis the expression of the soul of a nation \u2013 any community of people who are spiritually bound together by language, environment, history and common ideals and, above all, a continuity with the past.\u201d Vaughan Williams\u2019s remarks about the formation of national and individual identity lie at the heart of Richard King\u2019s new study of the connections between music and the natural world. Beginning with \u201cthe psychologically altered green fields of England [that] Vaughan Williams and the generation returning from the trenches encountered after the armistice\u201d, King sets out to chronicle, over roughly the course of a century, the ways in which the English countryside and character have been shaped and reimagined by forces social, political, economic and, above all, artistic. In doing so, he embarks on a meandering, associative and highly idiosyncratic trip on which he reflects on the agrarian revivalists and utopians of the 1920s and 1930s; the form that rural Britain would take as the nation was rebuilt in the wake of the second world war; the \u201cback to the land\u201d movement of the 1960s; and the alterations to our understanding of the countryside that occurred during the 1980s, exemplified most notably by the spectacle of new age travellers assembling annually at Stonehenge, and by the women\u2019s peace camp gathering outside the fence at Greenham Common to demonstrate against cruise missiles. The expedition ends with an extended meditation on the significance of the rave culture that flourished in England in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focusing most concertedly on the seven-day (illegal and law-changing) party that took place at Castlemorton Common in 1992. King, a bestselling cultural historian whose previous works include How Soon Is Now? (a study of the development of independent music) and Original Rockers (an account of the years King spent working at Bristol\u2019s Revolver Records), approaches these phenomena by attending to the ways in which they were shaped by and accommodated within the history of 20th-century music. Why music? Because, for King, \u201cfrom the song written to commemorate the mass trespass of Kinder Scout [in 1932] to the moment before the sound systems of the free festivals finally ran out of charge, music was the thread of this activity and flowed through the country like a river\u201d. In an effort to substantiate this claim, King draws on a series of \u201cheadphone walks\u201d (perambulations on which he listens to music) and an assortment of interviews he has conducted with an array of rural enthusiasts, film-makers and musicians, thinking along the way about the bucolic significance of Kate Bush, Brian Eno, Boards of Canada and Vaughan Williams, whose most popular composition, The Lark Ascending, \u201ccreated the musical equivalent of a British landscape open to \u2018every community\u2019\u201d and is of inestimable importance when it comes to understanding the lineaments of British life. Or so King argues. The resulting work is a peculiarly frustrating affair and most of the frustration is generated by King\u2019s insistence that music be recognised as the defining impetus behind, and register of, the changes he describes. The association between music and landscape may, as he rather grandly puts it, feel at times \u201calmost divine\u201d, but it is also \u201can eternal association that resists analysis\u201d. And, one might add, verification: almost nothing King says about the pastoral resonance of music moves beyond a kind of nebulous speculation. This, as he himself concedes, can be \u201cexasperating\u201d and contributes to a sense that his book as a whole eddies rather than builds. Often, the most engaging and enjoyable moments of The Lark Ascending occur when King is not discussing music at all. There is a lovely episode, for example, in which we learn of the environmental activists known as Ferguson\u2019s Gang, a group of five or six anonymous women who in the late 1920s aimed to support the activities of the National Trust by delivering to the organisation substantial donations \u201celaborately sewn into the carcass of a goose\u201d. But such moments are rare and do little to alleviate the impression that, on closing this book about the elevating reciprocity of music and nature, you have been on a journey that has dishearteningly failed to take flight. \u2022 The Lark Ascending by Richard King is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "body": "<p>In Boston, as the theme song for the American sitcom <em>Cheers</em> famously claims, \u201ceverybody knows your name\u201d. And it\u2019s true.</p> <p>But we are not talking Boston, Massachusetts. This is Boston, Lincolnshire, population 35,124; a town that is about to win new fame because an American cop, with a very familiar face, has been flown in to take charge of the local police force.</p> <p>Hollywood star Rob Lowe plays Bill Hixon, an experienced American police detective who would be much better suited to the larger Boston and so has plenty of adjusting to do in ITV\u2019s new drama series <em>Wild Bill</em>, which starts on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone really does know each other in our Boston,\u201d said Bronwyn James, who plays Lowe\u2019s police sidekick, Muriel, in the series and who grew up two hours away in Wakefield, Yorkshire. \u201cMy character is already part of the community. She is a detective, but she grew up on a farm.\u201d</p> <p>The crime drama, which is also executive produced by the former <em>West Wing </em>star, will restore the Lincolnshire town\u2019s significance on the map as the original Boston, the place from which the upstart American city takes its name.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been very few, if any, TV shows centred in the Lincolnshire area,\u201d Lowe has noted. \u201cThe characters that populate our show are not the people you think of when you think of London. They live in a very different world that does not get the spotlight shone on it very often.\u201d</p> <p>But Lowe\u2019s new beat, around Boston\u2019s rain-soaked marketplace, taking in the ancient tower of St Botolph\u2019s and the Herbert Ingram memorial, could soon be as well known to television viewers as the <em>West Wing</em> corridors he once walked with Martin Sheen.</p> <p>His co-star, James, told the <em>Observer</em> that the surrounding Lincolnshire countryside should really get top billing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d037165b4cdf214c6983bff82add82869d18dbf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d037165b4cdf214c6983bff82add82869d18dbf3/0_0_5272_3164/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Botolph\u2019s Church, Boston, Licolnshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Botolph\u2019s Church, Boston, Licolnshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Rayworth/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe old church tower pops up in the background. But the most notable thing in the show is all the flat fields, miles and miles of them. It screams Boston, Lincs, to me,\u201d said James, 24. \u201cIf anything, Boston is being celebrated.\u201d</p> <p>Inspiration for the series came from David Cameron\u2019s short-lived plan to bring in an American \u201csupercop\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/12/david-cameron-bill-bratton-met\" title=\"\">Bill Bratton</a>, to run the Metropolitan police. The show\u2019s creators were then also prompted to pick Boston as a location when the town earned the label \u201cthe home of Brexit\u201d, due to its high proportion of Leave voters in the 2016 referendum.</p> <p>Lowe has said the series depicts a place \u201cin turmoil and transition\u201d, with unexpected levels of crime and unemployment. It is, he added, \u201ca world looking for its identity.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>Wild Bill</em>, Lowe\u2019s cop moves to Boston, a place he describes as \u201ca godforsaken cabbage patch\u201d, with his 14-year-old daughter, Kelsey, in search of escape from a painful recent past. The 55-year-old actor was keen to make a series addressing divisions and inequalities in a community and one which also has echoes of the classic western plot, with a new sheriff riding into town.</p> <p>Lowe\u2019s fast-talking character has a degree in criminology, a masters in psychopathology and a doctorate in statistical mapping, and is determined to drive through a series of budget cuts. Each episode he and James\u2019s character tackle a different police case, but a key element of the comedy comes from seeing an American cop operating so far outside his comfort zone.</p> <p>And the actor claims he did not need to pretend to fail to understand his new environment: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one idea what people were saying. I was literally like my character.\u201d</p> <p>Lowe has, in fact, worked in Britain before. He had his big break 35 years ago in <em>Oxford Blues</em>, filmed in the university town.</p> <p>James took particular pleasure in introducing the famous actor to north country vocabulary. \u201cHe loved the slang words,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to explain them to him. \u2018What does that mean? That is so cool,\u2019 he\u2019d say. He\u2019d never heard the word \u2018victuals\u2019 used for food before. But he was really quick to pick up on things.\u201d</p> <p>James\u2019s own father is a policeman in Wakefield and she said her mother, a teacher, was even more excited than her daughter by the thought that Lowe was involved in the project.</p> <p>\u201cWhen they filmed a scene in the middle of town the cast were all buzzing the next day from the reception they had. People were giddy with it,\u201d said James, who describes Lowe as a very down-to-earth member of the cast, yet one who was full of \u201cvery American energy\u201d.</p> <p>Series writer Jim Keeble said \u201cthe absurdity of putting Rob Lowe in Lincolnshire\u201d was key to the show\u2019s appeal, but argues it is also about what Boston brings out in him and what he brings out in the place. \u201cWe are very divided as societies both here and in the US, and this show seeks not only to demonstrate that divide but also bring the two sides together. It\u2019s not always harmonious, but it does stir the pot.\u201d</p> <p>The port town of Boston in England was named after Saint Botolph, said to have founded the city. It is a contraction of Botwulf\u2019s Stone or Botwulf\u2019s tun, an Old English word for a hamlet. The Boston in America was founded in 1630 by the Massachusetts Bay Company. Several of the leading colonists wanted to name their capital after their English birthplace. Sailors later called the area \u201cbeantown\u201d, because of the dish frequently served to visitors.</p> <p>The English town, of course, is famous for a different foodstuff. As Rob Lowe has proclaimed: \u201cThe Lincolnshire sausages. You cannot beat them.\u201d</p>",

It screams Boston, Lincs, to me,\u201d said James, 24. \u201cIf anything, Boston is being celebrated.\u201d Inspiration for the series came from David Cameron\u2019s short-lived plan to bring in an American \u201csupercop\u201d, Bill Bratton, to run the Metropolitan police. The show\u2019s creators were then also prompted to pick Boston as a location when the town earned the label \u201cthe home of Brexit\u201d, due to its high proportion of Leave voters in the 2016 referendum. Lowe has said the series depicts a place \u201cin turmoil and transition\u201d, with unexpected levels of crime and unemployment. It is, he added, \u201ca world looking for its identity.\u201d In Wild Bill, Lowe\u2019s cop moves to Boston, a place he describes as \u201ca godforsaken cabbage patch\u201d, with his 14-year-old daughter, Kelsey, in search of escape from a painful recent past. The 55-year-old actor was keen to make a series addressing divisions and inequalities in a community and one which also has echoes of the classic western plot, with a new sheriff riding into town. Lowe\u2019s fast-talking character has a degree in criminology, a masters in psychopathology and a doctorate in statistical mapping, and is determined to drive through a series of budget cuts. Each episode he and James\u2019s character tackle a different police case, but a key element of the comedy comes from seeing an American cop operating so far outside his comfort zone. And the actor claims he did not need to pretend to fail to understand his new environment: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have one idea what people were saying. I was literally like my character.\u201d Lowe has, in fact, worked in Britain before. He had his big break 35 years ago in Oxford Blues, filmed in the university town. James took particular pleasure in introducing the famous actor to north country vocabulary. \u201cHe loved the slang words,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had to explain them to him. \u2018What does that mean? That is so cool,\u2019 he\u2019d say. He\u2019d never heard the word \u2018victuals\u2019 used for food before. But he was really quick to pick up on things.\u201d James\u2019s own father is a policeman in Wakefield and she said her mother, a teacher, was even more excited than her daughter by the thought that Lowe was involved in the project. \u201cWhen they filmed a scene in the middle of town the cast were all buzzing the next day from the reception they had. People were giddy with it,\u201d said James, who describes Lowe as a very down-to-earth member of the cast, yet one who was full of \u201cvery American energy\u201d. Series writer Jim Keeble said \u201cthe absurdity of putting Rob Lowe in Lincolnshire\u201d was key to the show\u2019s appeal, but argues it is also about what Boston brings out in him and what he brings out in the place. \u201cWe are very divided as societies both here and in the US, and this show seeks not only to demonstrate that divide but also bring the two sides together. It\u2019s not always harmonious, but it does stir the pot.\u201d The port town of Boston in England was named after Saint Botolph, said to have founded the city. It is a contraction of Botwulf\u2019s Stone or Botwulf\u2019s tun, an Old English word for a hamlet. The Boston in America was founded in 1630 by the Massachusetts Bay Company. Several of the leading colonists wanted to name their capital after their English birthplace. Sailors later called the area \u201cbeantown\u201d, because of the dish frequently served to visitors. The English town, of course, is famous for a different foodstuff. As Rob Lowe has proclaimed: \u201cThe Lincolnshire sausages. You cannot beat them.\u201d",

Yet, slowly, as inquiries are held and more cases come to court, greater numbers of adult survivors of childhood abuse are beginning to come forward. While some can cope well, for others lives and families are torn apart as the root causes remain hidden. Is society doing enough for adult survivors, who, too often, are overlooked, pathologised and criminalised?</p> <p>Jimmy Savile, \u201ceccentric and flamboyant\u201d, garlanded with honours and awards, died in 2011 aged 84, never having paid for his crimes. A year after his death, he was revealed as a prolific and ruthless sexual predator throughout five decades. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/26/jimmy-savile-sexual-abuse-timeline\" title=\"\">Concerns had been raised since the 1960s and suppressed</a>. He had fame and power, so was free to abuse in plain sight.</p> <p>Since then, a number of prolific offenders have appeared in court including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/jul/23/establishment-rallied-to-help-ex-bishop-later-jailed-for-abuse\" title=\"\">Peter Ball</a>, a bishop who was protected by the establishment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/feb/19/barry-bennell-branded-sheer-evil-as-he-is-sentenced-to-31-years\" title=\"\">Barry Bennell</a>, a football coach, and the pop singer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/05/gary-glitter-guilty-child-sex-offences\" title=\"\">Gary Glitter</a>.

Sixty colleagues from healthcare, the police, GPs, voluntary organisations and the city council attended. \u201cThe decades of denial and cover-up were beginning to crack,\u201d Denham says. \u201cThat made me think, as a city, \u2018What should we do? What do we need to do?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAbuse has shaped me. It still affects my daily life,\u201d she says. \u201cI was abused by my grandfather and my stepfather. Yet for years I\u2019d tell everyone that I hadn\u2019t been affected. It was only when I went for counselling in my 30s that I began to join up the dots of my own behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m middle class, mouthy and I don\u2019t lack confidence. Imagine what it must be like for someone who has none of those resources. Some survivors cope, others experience addiction, unemployment, prison, chaotic, shattered families, and still the secret is kept. That\u2019s why we passionately believe it\u2019s time to make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>The difference is a potentially groundbreaking holistic <a href=\"https://visibleproject.org.uk/\" title=\"\">city-wide project called Visible</a>, launched in Leeds on 10 June after two years of plannning. The aim is to proactively support adult survivors and open up a national conversation about the extent of need and why long-term government funding is essential.</p> <p>The ambition is that projects like Visible are replicated across the country.</p> <p>\u201cIt was as if we all gave a collective sigh of relief,\u201d says Sin\u00e9ad Cregan, Leeds adult services commissioner and chair of Visible. \u201cPhew! At last we\u2019re going to try and do something. More and more people at inquiries are talking for the first time. Yet, across the country, the response has not been good enough.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3e57855ada5af7cde9207a9a1fdd416cd5239d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3e57855ada5af7cde9207a9a1fdd416cd5239d5/0_150_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sin\u00e9ad Cregan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sin\u00e9ad Cregan says the country\u2019s response has not been good enough.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What will Visible do in practice? Survivors say that many professionals don\u2019t recognise trauma, and they don\u2019t ask the right questions because they don\u2019t know how to handle the response. Visible hopes to conduct research into what works best, increase public understanding, and train a range of professionals including police, magistrates, employers, commissioners, GPs, teachers and social workers to ask the right questions so that a range of appropriate help is offered. \u201cWe want to act as a catalyst.\u201d Denham says. \u201cWhen money is tight, there are no quick fixes but the door has begun to open.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPhil\u201d, 52, is on Visible\u2019s steering group. He waited 40 years before disclosing that as a boy he was abused by two men who threatened to harm his family if he told anyone. \u201cIt was when my son was the same age that I told my wife. I had a breakdown. I was worried the same thing would happen to him. I\u2019d text him all the time.</p> <p>\u201cI waited 12 months before I got into the mental health system. I\u2019ve self-harmed, I\u2019ve tried to take my own life. I was interviewed by the police about Jimmy Savile because I worked with him as a hospital porter \u2013 and that\u2019s when it got worse. I see the devil with the abusers\u2019 face. I hear voices. In an ideal world, I\u2019d like for people to speak out and be heard.\u201d</p> <p>In May, the <a href=\"https://www.appgsurvivorscsa.co.uk/infosupportsurvivors\" title=\"\">all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse published a report</a> that drew on a survey of 365 survivors. Long-term consequences of abuse may include physical ailments, changes in brain function and development, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and dissociative disorder, an involuntary flight from reality that may include significant memory loss, depression and suicidal thoughts.</p> <p>In the survey, 90% said their intimate relationships were negatively affected, 89% said their mental health was negatively affected, 72% said that it had damaged their career, and 46% said it had a detrimental effect on their financial situation (because they often had to pay for therapeutic help they couldn\u2019t access otherwise). Only 16% said the NHS mental health services met their need. \u201cI am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and the mental health system,\u201d was one response.</p> <p>\u201cThe spectre hanging over them infiltrates every aspect of life,\u201d Sarah Champion, Labour MP and chair of the APPG said in the Commons. \u201cA trigger can be anything \u2013 the same aftershave that their abuser was wearing or a feeling of being in an enclosed space. Unless we recognise that these people are victims of crime, they will not be able to lead their full lives and reach the potential that we all deserve to achieve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.iicsa.org.uk/key-documents/5381/view/social-political-discourses-about-child-sexual-abuse-their-influence-institutional-responses-full-report_0.pdf\" title=\"\">Deflection, denial and disbelief</a>\u201d has too often greeted those who speak out about abuse. Yet its scale is clear. The number of recorded sexual offences against children under 16 in England and Wales <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/bulletins/crimeinenglandandwales/yearendingseptember2018\" title=\"\">more than doubled in the four years to 2017 from 24,085 to 53,496</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cfb724c98c1bacdb3446b0b5579b6985d336f8ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cfb724c98c1bacdb3446b0b5579b6985d336f8ae/0_442_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shaneen Mooney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaneen Mooney says victims don\u2019t have to carry shame \u2013 healing is possible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303647666_Hear_me_Believe_me_Respect_me_A_survey_of_adult_survivors_of_child_sexual_abuse_and_their_experience_of_support_services\" title=\"\">2015 survey of 400 adult survivors</a> indicated that the abuse had begun, on average, at the age of seven and continued for long periods; 90% hadn\u2019t seen their abuser brought to justice. The average wait before survivors tried to access services had been 20 years, and not even then had individuals disclosed abuse. For one in five who disclosed at the time, the abuse continued on average for a further six years.</p> <p>Last year NHS England announced improved provision for victims of sexual abuse. The five-year strategy has an investment of \u00a34m a year until 2020-21. \u201cIt\u2019s welcome but it\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d says Fay Maxted, chief executive of <a href=\"http://thesurvivorstrust.org\" title=\"\">the Survivors Trust</a>, which represents 130 organisations. \u201cIn real terms, funding has dropped significantly in the last 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>She is also concerned that the specialist trauma-trained organisations in the voluntary sector, which survivors frequently say they prefer to statutory services, won\u2019t benefit from the funding controlled by GPs\u2019 clinical commissioning groups. \u201cThe CCGs often have a lack of understanding of what survivors need.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAdult survivors don\u2019t always present as the perfect victim,\u201d explains Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac). \u201cWe all need to understand better that the question isn\u2019t, \u2018what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 but \u2018what happened to you?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Shaneen Mooney, 34, a housing officer, who runs her own essential oils company, Essential Flow, waited 16 years before disclosing. At the age of 14 she was groomed by a man in his 30s. \u201cI thought it was romantic love. He ended the affair when I was 16. For years I didn\u2019t value myself. I drank, I took drugs, I was unfaithful. I had a breakdown and dropped out of university and gradually began to realise that what had happened to me wasn\u2019t right. It was rape.</p> <p>\u201cIn 2014 I was given free counselling by a rape support charity. That\u2019s no longer available. Then I waited a year for NHS counselling, which was hard. Gradually, I realised that the silence, keeping all the stuff inside me, was more damaging.\u201d</p> <p>Now happily married, Mooney says counselling has been invaluable. \u201cI\u2019m in a much better place. Victims don\u2019t have to carry shame and believe there\u2019s something wrong with them. Healing and wellbeing are possible. That\u2019s why I share my truth in the hope that it will encourage others to break the taboo, speak out and get help. Life can change.\u201d</p> <p>In 2018, Napac, received 6,458 calls on its helpline but there were another 87,619 calls that couldn\u2019t be taken because of lack of resources.</p> <p>In Leeds, will Visible unleash a demand that similarly can\u2019t be met? According to the IICSA, some 2 million people, are adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, and 15% of girls and 5% of boys are predicted to experience sexual abuse before the age of 16. In Leeds those figures would translate to 50,000 adult survivors and more than 15,000 children and young people.</p> <p>Visible was launched with a grant of \u00a3100,000 from Lloyds Bank Foundation. It has applied for further grants. Leeds city council faces a \u00a3100m funding gap by 2022. Will hopes be raised but not met?</p> <p>\u201cHealth commissioners and government have to stump up the money,\u201d Richard Barber of Leeds Survivor-Led Crisis Service says unequivocally. \u201cSociety has got its head stuck in the sand about the scale of child sexual abuse. As a result, survivors get demonised and traumatised over and over again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"233c690e75ff1179170ec4d172535b7dfcf767a2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/233c690e75ff1179170ec4d172535b7dfcf767a2/0_224_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sharon Prince\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sharon Prince says everyone knows somebody who is directly or indirectly affected.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cEverybody knows somebody who is directly or indirectly affected,\u201d points out Sharon Prince, consultant psychologist with Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, a part of Visible. \u201cWe have to change the response. That can range from family and friends listening and validating to more formal interventions. The first steps are for people to trust enough so they can disclose and be believed.\u201d</p> <p>Visible promotes \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d support for survivors. It is based on building trust, collaboration and a survivor exercising choice. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the quality of the relationship,\u201d Prince says.</p> <p>While funds for survivors are woefully inadequate, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has spent an extraordinary \u00a396m since 2014. It has recommended that support for adult survivors requires \u201curgent\u201d attention. Money is promised in the forthcoming spending review. In addition, the parliamentary group wants the Home Office to commission research into the hidden economic and social cost of child sexual abuse, collect data on what is spent on therapeutic care, and research what support works best.</p> <p>Dr Carol-Ann Hooper, Visible\u2019s evaluator, says: \u201cIn the US, the term \u2018parallel justice\u2019 has been coined to argue for reparation for victims to take its place alongside the prosecution of offenders to enable survivors to heal and rebuild their lives. There is also a significant income-based justice gap. Those who can afford to pay for therapeutic help have options, those who can\u2019t, may have none.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHelena\u201d, 60, a former teacher, pays for trauma therapy. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d have to wait several months and I can\u2019t.\u201d As a child, she and her friend, Janet, played in the street. A teenage girl invited them into her home. \u201cWe\u2019d dress up in her clothes and stilettos,\u201d Helena says. Play turned to abuse and both children had a bottle inserted in their vaginas. \u201cI felt I\u2019d done wrong. I did tell my parents three years later. They said, \u2018We can\u2019t do owt. It\u2019s water under the bridge. The abuse made me wary of young women, mistrust everybody. I still find it very difficult to hug people. I became anorexic. I wanted to be unseen. Occasionally I\u2019d mention what happened and people would say, \u2018women don\u2019t do that\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago, Helena went to an exhibition. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky. There was an image called <em>Release</em>. I thought yes, you need to unburden, take away those heavy things on your shoulders. For years, I didn\u2019t like clothes or dressing up, I didn\u2019t like high heels. I never had friendships. But suddenly, I thought, yes, I can have friends. And I do. Abuse results in so many ripples over a lifetime. People don\u2019t think to ask, \u2018what are those ripples really about?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Visible already has plans to expand its work to include sporting bodies, churches, mosques, major corporations, magistrates and prisons. Leeds city council will also look at its own large workforce to assess the needs of potentially several hundred survivors. \u201cWe are also keen to collaborate with anyone in the UK,\u201d Denham says. \u201cWe cannot afford to slip back.\u201d</p> <h2>I was isolated and petrified</h2> <p>\u201cI was abused until I was 11 by someone outside the family. When it was happening, it was horrible but I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss\u201d says Debbie, 43.</p> <p>\u201cBy the time it stopped, I was isolated and petrified of everything. I\u2019d hide in the cupboard if the phone rang. People would think I was rude. I just wanted to be invisible.</p> <p>\u201cI worked hard at university because I thought I was thick and horrible. I had a breakdown. I tried to commit suicide. I was in psychiatric hospital for four months. I became anorexic. At no point did anybody ask me why I hated myself. Why I was anorexic.\u201d</p> <p>At one point, Debbie weighed four stone and suffered multiple organ failure. \u201cIt took 10 years before I began psychotherapy and somebody finally asked me the right questions; otherwise my earlier medical records all say things like, \u2018Deborah\u2019s had a lot of input with little progress\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been diagnosed with OCD, personality disorder, complex PTSD.\u201d</p> <p>Unusually, Debbie received 12 years of support on the NHS, but then it stopped. Now she pays privately for psychotherapy. \u201cI know things cognitively but I have no feeling. I\u2019m not in touch with things emotionally. I\u2019ve no attachment to anyone or anything.</p> <p>\u201cSix years ago, my mum asked if anyone had done anything to me. I don\u2019t want my mum to know. I don\u2019t want her to work out who it is. I don\u2019t want him to say it didn\u2019t happen. I want to feel safe and not want to be dead. I want to feel.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "On 2 June, Noa Pothoven, 17, died at home in the Dutch city of Arnhem having refused all fluids and food. She had been sexually assaulted at the age of 11 and raped at 14, and suffered from anorexia and depression. She spoke of her \u201cunbearable suffering\u201d in the aftermath of the attacks \u2013 \u201cI have not been alive for so long,\u201d she wrote. For survivors of childhood abuse, the potential long-term impact of their experiences is only beginning to be exposed; taboo, secrecy and shame still prevail. Yet, slowly, as inquiries are held and more cases come to court, greater numbers of adult survivors of childhood abuse are beginning to come forward. While some can cope well, for others lives and families are torn apart as the root causes remain hidden. Is society doing enough for adult survivors, who, too often, are overlooked, pathologised and criminalised? Jimmy Savile, \u201ceccentric and flamboyant\u201d, garlanded with honours and awards, died in 2011 aged 84, never having paid for his crimes. A year after his death, he was revealed as a prolific and ruthless sexual predator throughout five decades. Concerns had been raised since the 1960s and suppressed. He had fame and power, so was free to abuse in plain sight. Since then, a number of prolific offenders have appeared in court including Peter Ball, a bishop who was protected by the establishment, Barry Bennell, a football coach, and the pop singer Gary Glitter. In addition, groups of mainly Asian men, in cities including Rotherham, Nottingham and Oxford, have been given lengthy jail sentences for violently sexually exploiting vulnerable young girls, the victims treated by police and social workers as \u201cchild prostitutes\u201d, their plight ignored. In 2014 the government established the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) to examine how institutions, including hospitals, care homes and boarding schools, have handled their duty of care to protect children. The inquiry has launched 14 investigations and has set up the Truth Project, \u201cI Will Be Heard\u201d. So far, more than 3,000 survivors of abuse have related their experiences at the hands of trusted adults, family members and in institutions. Four years ago in Leeds, Savile\u2019s birthplace, Tessa Denham, 58, a counsellor, coach and chief executive of the Women\u2019s Counselling and Therapy Service, organised a workshop. Sixty colleagues from healthcare, the police, GPs, voluntary organisations and the city council attended. \u201cThe decades of denial and cover-up were beginning to crack,\u201d Denham says. \u201cThat made me think, as a city, \u2018What should we do? What do we need to do?\u2019 \u201cAbuse has shaped me. It still affects my daily life,\u201d she says. \u201cI was abused by my grandfather and my stepfather. Yet for years I\u2019d tell everyone that I hadn\u2019t been affected. It was only when I went for counselling in my 30s that I began to join up the dots of my own behaviour. \u201cI\u2019m middle class, mouthy and I don\u2019t lack confidence. Imagine what it must be like for someone who has none of those resources. Some survivors cope, others experience addiction, unemployment, prison, chaotic, shattered families, and still the secret is kept. That\u2019s why we passionately believe it\u2019s time to make a difference.\u201d The difference is a potentially groundbreaking holistic city-wide project called Visible, launched in Leeds on 10 June after two years of plannning. The aim is to proactively support adult survivors and open up a national conversation about the extent of need and why long-term government funding is essential. The ambition is that projects like Visible are replicated across the country. \u201cIt was as if we all gave a collective sigh of relief,\u201d says Sin\u00e9ad Cregan, Leeds adult services commissioner and chair of Visible. \u201cPhew! At last we\u2019re going to try and do something. More and more people at inquiries are talking for the first time. Yet, across the country, the response has not been good enough.\u201d What will Visible do in practice? Survivors say that many professionals don\u2019t recognise trauma, and they don\u2019t ask the right questions because they don\u2019t know how to handle the response. Visible hopes to conduct research into what works best, increase public understanding, and train a range of professionals including police, magistrates, employers, commissioners, GPs, teachers and social workers to ask the right questions so that a range of appropriate help is offered. \u201cWe want to act as a catalyst.\u201d Denham says. \u201cWhen money is tight, there are no quick fixes but the door has begun to open.\u201d \u201cPhil\u201d, 52, is on Visible\u2019s steering group. He waited 40 years before disclosing that as a boy he was abused by two men who threatened to harm his family if he told anyone. \u201cIt was when my son was the same age that I told my wife. I had a breakdown. I was worried the same thing would happen to him. I\u2019d text him all the time. \u201cI waited 12 months before I got into the mental health system. I\u2019ve self-harmed, I\u2019ve tried to take my own life. I was interviewed by the police about Jimmy Savile because I worked with him as a hospital porter \u2013 and that\u2019s when it got worse. I see the devil with the abusers\u2019 face. I hear voices. In an ideal world, I\u2019d like for people to speak out and be heard.\u201d In May, the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse published a report that drew on a survey of 365 survivors. Long-term consequences of abuse may include physical ailments, changes in brain function and development, post-traumatic stress disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and dissociative disorder, an involuntary flight from reality that may include significant memory loss, depression and suicidal thoughts. In the survey, 90% said their intimate relationships were negatively affected, 89% said their mental health was negatively affected, 72% said that it had damaged their career, and 46% said it had a detrimental effect on their financial situation (because they often had to pay for therapeutic help they couldn\u2019t access otherwise). Only 16% said the NHS mental health services met their need. \u201cI am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and the mental health system,\u201d was one response. \u201cThe spectre hanging over them infiltrates every aspect of life,\u201d Sarah Champion, Labour MP and chair of the APPG said in the Commons. \u201cA trigger can be anything \u2013 the same aftershave that their abuser was wearing or a feeling of being in an enclosed space. Unless we recognise that these people are victims of crime, they will not be able to lead their full lives and reach the potential that we all deserve to achieve.\u201d \u201cDeflection, denial and disbelief\u201d has too often greeted those who speak out about abuse. Yet its scale is clear. The number of recorded sexual offences against children under 16 in England and Wales more than doubled in the four years to 2017 from 24,085 to 53,496. A 2015 survey of 400 adult survivors indicated that the abuse had begun, on average, at the age of seven and continued for long periods; 90% hadn\u2019t seen their abuser brought to justice. The average wait before survivors tried to access services had been 20 years, and not even then had individuals disclosed abuse. For one in five who disclosed at the time, the abuse continued on average for a further six years. Last year NHS England announced improved provision for victims of sexual abuse. The five-year strategy has an investment of \u00a34m a year until 2020-21. \u201cIt\u2019s welcome but it\u2019s a drop in the ocean,\u201d says Fay Maxted, chief executive of the Survivors Trust, which represents 130 organisations. \u201cIn real terms, funding has dropped significantly in the last 10 years.\u201d She is also concerned that the specialist trauma-trained organisations in the voluntary sector, which survivors frequently say they prefer to statutory services, won\u2019t benefit from the funding controlled by GPs\u2019 clinical commissioning groups. \u201cThe CCGs often have a lack of understanding of what survivors need.\u201d \u201cAdult survivors don\u2019t always present as the perfect victim,\u201d explains Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac). \u201cWe all need to understand better that the question isn\u2019t, \u2018what\u2019s wrong with you?\u2019 but \u2018what happened to you?\u2019\u201d Shaneen Mooney, 34, a housing officer, who runs her own essential oils company, Essential Flow, waited 16 years before disclosing. At the age of 14 she was groomed by a man in his 30s. \u201cI thought it was romantic love. He ended the affair when I was 16. For years I didn\u2019t value myself. I drank, I took drugs, I was unfaithful. I had a breakdown and dropped out of university and gradually began to realise that what had happened to me wasn\u2019t right. It was rape. \u201cIn 2014 I was given free counselling by a rape support charity. That\u2019s no longer available. Then I waited a year for NHS counselling, which was hard. Gradually, I realised that the silence, keeping all the stuff inside me, was more damaging.\u201d Now happily married, Mooney says counselling has been invaluable. \u201cI\u2019m in a much better place. Victims don\u2019t have to carry shame and believe there\u2019s something wrong with them. Healing and wellbeing are possible. That\u2019s why I share my truth in the hope that it will encourage others to break the taboo, speak out and get help. Life can change.\u201d In 2018, Napac, received 6,458 calls on its helpline but there were another 87,619 calls that couldn\u2019t be taken because of lack of resources. In Leeds, will Visible unleash a demand that similarly can\u2019t be met? According to the IICSA, some 2 million people, are adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse, and 15% of girls and 5% of boys are predicted to experience sexual abuse before the age of 16. In Leeds those figures would translate to 50,000 adult survivors and more than 15,000 children and young people. Visible was launched with a grant of \u00a3100,000 from Lloyds Bank Foundation. It has applied for further grants. Leeds city council faces a \u00a3100m funding gap by 2022. Will hopes be raised but not met? \u201cHealth commissioners and government have to stump up the money,\u201d Richard Barber of Leeds Survivor-Led Crisis Service says unequivocally. \u201cSociety has got its head stuck in the sand about the scale of child sexual abuse. As a result, survivors get demonised and traumatised over and over again.\u201d \u201cEverybody knows somebody who is directly or indirectly affected,\u201d points out Sharon Prince, consultant psychologist with Leeds and York Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, a part of Visible. \u201cWe have to change the response. That can range from family and friends listening and validating to more formal interventions. The first steps are for people to trust enough so they can disclose and be believed.\u201d Visible promotes \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d support for survivors. It is based on building trust, collaboration and a survivor exercising choice. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the quality of the relationship,\u201d Prince says. While funds for survivors are woefully inadequate, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has spent an extraordinary \u00a396m since 2014. It has recommended that support for adult survivors requires \u201curgent\u201d attention. Money is promised in the forthcoming spending review. In addition, the parliamentary group wants the Home Office to commission research into the hidden economic and social cost of child sexual abuse, collect data on what is spent on therapeutic care, and research what support works best. Dr Carol-Ann Hooper, Visible\u2019s evaluator, says: \u201cIn the US, the term \u2018parallel justice\u2019 has been coined to argue for reparation for victims to take its place alongside the prosecution of offenders to enable survivors to heal and rebuild their lives. There is also a significant income-based justice gap. Those who can afford to pay for therapeutic help have options, those who can\u2019t, may have none.\u201d \u201cHelena\u201d, 60, a former teacher, pays for trauma therapy. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019d have to wait several months and I can\u2019t.\u201d As a child, she and her friend, Janet, played in the street. A teenage girl invited them into her home. \u201cWe\u2019d dress up in her clothes and stilettos,\u201d Helena says. Play turned to abuse and both children had a bottle inserted in their vaginas. \u201cI felt I\u2019d done wrong. I did tell my parents three years later. They said, \u2018We can\u2019t do owt. It\u2019s water under the bridge. The abuse made me wary of young women, mistrust everybody. I still find it very difficult to hug people. I became anorexic. I wanted to be unseen. Occasionally I\u2019d mention what happened and people would say, \u2018women don\u2019t do that\u2019.\u201d A few years ago, Helena went to an exhibition. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky. There was an image called Release. I thought yes, you need to unburden, take away those heavy things on your shoulders. For years, I didn\u2019t like clothes or dressing up, I didn\u2019t like high heels. I never had friendships. But suddenly, I thought, yes, I can have friends. And I do. Abuse results in so many ripples over a lifetime. People don\u2019t think to ask, \u2018what are those ripples really about?\u2019\u201d Visible already has plans to expand its work to include sporting bodies, churches, mosques, major corporations, magistrates and prisons. Leeds city council will also look at its own large workforce to assess the needs of potentially several hundred survivors. \u201cWe are also keen to collaborate with anyone in the UK,\u201d Denham says. \u201cWe cannot afford to slip back.\u201d I was isolated and petrified \u201cI was abused until I was 11 by someone outside the family. When it was happening, it was horrible but I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss\u201d says Debbie, 43. \u201cBy the time it stopped, I was isolated and petrified of everything. I\u2019d hide in the cupboard if the phone rang. People would think I was rude. I just wanted to be invisible. \u201cI worked hard at university because I thought I was thick and horrible. I had a breakdown. I tried to commit suicide. I was in psychiatric hospital for four months. I became anorexic. At no point did anybody ask me why I hated myself. Why I was anorexic.\u201d At one point, Debbie weighed four stone and suffered multiple organ failure. \u201cIt took 10 years before I began psychotherapy and somebody finally asked me the right questions; otherwise my earlier medical records all say things like, \u2018Deborah\u2019s had a lot of input with little progress\u2019. \u201cI\u2019ve been diagnosed with OCD, personality disorder, complex PTSD.\u201d Unusually, Debbie received 12 years of support on the NHS, but then it stopped. Now she pays privately for psychotherapy. \u201cI know things cognitively but I have no feeling. I\u2019m not in touch with things emotionally. I\u2019ve no attachment to anyone or anything. \u201cSix years ago, my mum asked if anyone had done anything to me. I don\u2019t want my mum to know. I don\u2019t want her to work out who it is. I don\u2019t want him to say it didn\u2019t happen. I want to feel safe and not want to be dead. I want to feel.\u201d",

Homeowners who install new rooftop solar panels from 1 January 2020 will be able to lower their bills by selling the energy they do not need to their supplier. A record was set at noon on a Friday in May 2017, when solar energy supplied around a quarter of the UK\u2019s electricity. However, solar panel owners are not always at home on sunny days to reap the benefit. The new rules will allow them to make money if they generate electricity for the grid. Some 800,000 householders with solar panels already benefit from payments under a previous scheme. However, the subsidies were controversially scrapped by the government in April, causing the number of new installations to fall by 94% in May from the month before. Labour accused the government last week of \u201cactively dismantling\u201d the solar industry. The sector will still struggle this summer as the change does not come in for another seven months, so homeowners have no incentive to buy panels this year. Chris Skidmore, the minister for energy and clean growth, said the government wanted to increase the number of small-scale generators without adding the cost of subsidies to energy bills. \u201cThe future of energy is local and the new smart export guarantee will ensure households that choose to become green energy generators will be guaranteed a payment for electricity supplied to the grid,\u201d he said. The government also hopes to encourage homes with solar panels to install batteries. Greg Jackson, the founder of Octopus Energy, said: \u201cThese smart export tariffs are game-changing when it comes to harnessing the power of citizens to tackle climate change\u201d. A few suppliers, including Octopus, already offer to buy solar power from their customers. \u201cThey mean homes and businesses can be paid for producing clean electricity just like traditional generators, replacing old dirty power stations and pumping more renewable energy into the grid. This will help bring down prices for everyone as we use cheaper power generated locally by our neighbours,\u201d Jackson said. L\u00e9onie Greene, a director at the Solar Trade Association, said it was \u201cvital\u201d that even \u201cvery small players\u201d were paid a fair price. \u201cWe will be watching the market like a hawk to see if competitive offers come forward that properly value the power that smart solar homes can contribute to the decarbonising electricity grid,\u201d she said.",

Tony, the artful dodger with aspirations to become a jockey, had met his future wife, Debbie, at a disco, and Paul, one of the boys from the care home, had moved to Australia and found his soulmate, Susan. Forty-two years on, this time around, two of those bonds \u2013 Paul\u2019s and Tony\u2019s \u2013 had endured, despite everything.

It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are clearing 30,000 truck-loads of garbage out of the old city of Kabul, or making Britain lead the world in its approach to the environment and the climate cataclysm: what matters is facing reality \u2013 and having the determination and energy to force change through.

But his sheer unbending will remains a remarkable source of strength in his late years. Like Ulysses in the poem, returning home to Ithaca from his glorious travels, there is an element of epic glamour about Ronaldo\u2019s presence as Portugal\u2019s captain in Porto for the Nations League final on Sunday night.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/08/croatia-wales-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report\">Ivan Perisic shows no mercy as Croatia put early dent in Wales\u2019 Euro 2020 hopes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ronaldo refuses to pause or make an end of anything. His career has basically been an exercise in refusing to go away, in paring back and refining his own irresistible gifts to a fine point, in never letting anything drop. The Nations League may feel like a lukewarm, managed competition for those on the outside. But you can bet nobody will be taking the final as seriously as Ronaldo.</p> <p>In part because of that voracious trophy-hoovering hunger. But also because all things have an end point. Ronaldo will be 35 years old by the time the next major final comes around for club or country.</p> <p>His longevity is astonishing. But it is also deceptive, just as the time is always a little later than you think. Whisper it, but Sunday night could easily turn out to be the last time football\u2019s great compound digital eye gets to see Ronaldo play in a major final. One thing is certain. He will be ready. And as ever he will have something to prove.</p> <p>There is a cyclical element to this homecoming. When Ronaldo leads his team out to face the Netherlands at the Est\u00e1dio do Drag\u00e3o it will be just short of 15 years since he followed Fernando Couto out at the Est\u00e1dio da Luz, 200 miles down the coast from Porto, for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jul/05/euro2004.sport1\" title=\"\">the final of Euro 2004</a>.</p> <p>Ronaldo ended up weeping cinematically on the pitch that day. He has been relentless in seeking a personal catharsis. Fifteen years on, all 26 of the other players in that final have retired. The only member of the wider Portugal squad still also going is the reserve goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Moreira, currently playing, aged 37, for Cova da Piedade in the Portuguese second division. Ronaldo, meanwhile is still front and centre, still smarting at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/03/ballon-dor-ada-hegerberg-twerk-luka-modric\" title=\"\">not getting his sixth Ballon d\u2019Or</a>, still quietly furious at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/apr/16/juventus-ajax-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">being denied another Champions League</a>, with Juventus. What is it with this guy? Where will it end?</p> <p>Plus, there is the added element of home. We have become so used to the Ronaldo brand, that immaculately gelled iconography of cheekbones and muscular perfection, the movements that seem to come from some personalised high-end choreography. But he is also fiercely cherished in Portugal, unchallenged as his country\u2019s most celebrated professional athlete, its richest entertainer, its most famous person, as they say in America, period.</p> <p>This week the Portuguese newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias carried an article suggesting this Nations League is worth \u20ac150m (\u00a3130m) to the Portuguese economy \u2013 but only if Ronaldo plays. Without Ronaldo the brands hang back, the TV interest wanes, even ticket sales would fall.</p> <p>Sportspeople are often referred to as brands and influencers, often without much basis beyond their own hopeful publicity. Ronaldo, as ever, has the numbers to back it up. This is a one-man economic driver. Albeit one entering its legacy phase.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7fbe1870cfa2313dbbd681623b1746730480bfb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7fbe1870cfa2313dbbd681623b1746730480bfb1/0_78_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cristiano Ronaldo despairs after Portugal\u2019s defeat to Greece in the final of Euro 2004\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cristiano Ronaldo despairs after Portugal\u2019s defeat to Greece in the final of Euro 2004</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Estela Silva/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a further significance in the hunt for a second international title. Ronaldo\u2019s club feats are already written in letters of hyperbolic fire. But in international football, he has been arguably the most effective single presence in the last five years.</p> <p>Since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/germany-argentina-world-cup-final-2014-match-report\" title=\"\">Germany won the World Cup</a> in 2014, Ronaldo has scored 36 goals in 39 games for Portugal. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/10/france-portugal-euro-2016-match-report\" title=\"\">captained them to victory in the Euros</a> and could be about to win this inaugural off-year competition. If it is to be his final final, it will be a final of consequence, not least for the Ronaldo legend. But then the first rule of writing off Ronaldo is never write off Ronaldo. This is a player of rare completeness. No attacker has ever defined so successfully exactly how he is going to play and win. Whatever you say he is, that is what he is not. Ronaldo has succeeded completely in every task he has set his own talent.</p> <p>From the tricky winger of Sporting Lisbon, to the glorious inside forward of Manchester United, to the complete central striker of Real Madrid, to the restrained, goal-hungry version of his late years at the same club. Right now we are in fifth-wave Ronaldo: the imperial goal-hammer years.</p> <p>It works, too. Ronaldo\u2019s movement has dropped but the returns are still there. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/05/portugal-switzerland-nations-league-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">that hat-trick game against Switzerland</a> there was even a sense of Ronaldo digging deep in his playbook and finding some of his old standards, most obviously in one vintage retro-dribble past Kevin Mbabu on the touchline.</p> <p>Perhaps there is even an element of calculation here. Ronaldo will be up against Virgil Van Dijk on Sunday night. Van Dijk has already shown against Harry Kane that he will win most attempts to wrestle or play at close quarters. Running, dribbling, attacking at unusual angles: these will be useful tools. Ronaldo still has it in him. How he attempts to play Van Dijk will be fascinating.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4163\" height=\"52\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Fiver\" data-form-description=\"Get our daily email on the world of football\" data-form-campaign-code=\"Fiver_signup_page\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email. </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That duel has been a key strand in the buildup. Not that anyone knows what Ronaldo really thinks about any of this. He remains behind the veil, communicating only with Uefa in gobbets of football-speak inanity, confined by the pressure of those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/05/cristiano-ronaldo-rape-allegation-state-lawsuit-dropped\" title=\"\">ongoing rape charges</a> in the US.</p> <p>It is another point of pressure. There are those who maintain the accusations against Ronaldo should be mentioned every time he plays, so serious is the charge. On the other hand, it is possible to applaud his victim for having the courage to speak out \u2013 Ronaldo is powerful person with a powerful machine behind him \u2013 while still respecting due process, just as Ronaldo is innocent until the law decides otherwise.</p> <p>For now the case has become another strand in his unusual degree of remoteness. Beyond that opaque public face Ronaldo has always been distant. It is a remarkable feat of obscurity in itself, another statement of his personal power. Ronaldo can do things such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/jun/14/just-give-the-ball-to-cristiano-ronaldo-portugals-plan-a-and-b\" title=\"\">attempting to claim</a> half of the tiny dressing room at Iceland\u2019s Laugardalsv\u00f6llur stadium solely for himself before kick-off in a European qualifier, but still retain at all times the total respect of his teammates.</p> <p>This is a fine Portugal team, too. Neves-Carvalho-Silva is a midfield to go deep into any tournament. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix offers vast attacking promise. Still though the focus, the sense of drive and destiny will come from the man at the front, an icon of the age who continues even now to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.</p>",

Ronaldo ended up weeping cinematically on the pitch that day. He has been relentless in seeking a personal catharsis. Fifteen years on, all 26 of the other players in that final have retired. The only member of the wider Portugal squad still also going is the reserve goalkeeper Jos\u00e9 Moreira, currently playing, aged 37, for Cova da Piedade in the Portuguese second division. Ronaldo, meanwhile is still front and centre, still smarting at not getting his sixth Ballon d\u2019Or, still quietly furious at being denied another Champions League, with Juventus. What is it with this guy? Where will it end? Plus, there is the added element of home. We have become so used to the Ronaldo brand, that immaculately gelled iconography of cheekbones and muscular perfection, the movements that seem to come from some personalised high-end choreography. But he is also fiercely cherished in Portugal, unchallenged as his country\u2019s most celebrated professional athlete, its richest entertainer, its most famous person, as they say in America, period. This week the Portuguese newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias carried an article suggesting this Nations League is worth \u20ac150m (\u00a3130m) to the Portuguese economy \u2013 but only if Ronaldo plays. Without Ronaldo the brands hang back, the TV interest wanes, even ticket sales would fall. Sportspeople are often referred to as brands and influencers, often without much basis beyond their own hopeful publicity. Ronaldo, as ever, has the numbers to back it up. This is a one-man economic driver. Albeit one entering its legacy phase. There is a further significance in the hunt for a second international title. Ronaldo\u2019s club feats are already written in letters of hyperbolic fire. But in international football, he has been arguably the most effective single presence in the last five years. Since Germany won the World Cup in 2014, Ronaldo has scored 36 goals in 39 games for Portugal. He has captained them to victory in the Euros and could be about to win this inaugural off-year competition. If it is to be his final final, it will be a final of consequence, not least for the Ronaldo legend. But then the first rule of writing off Ronaldo is never write off Ronaldo. This is a player of rare completeness. No attacker has ever defined so successfully exactly how he is going to play and win. Whatever you say he is, that is what he is not. Ronaldo has succeeded completely in every task he has set his own talent. From the tricky winger of Sporting Lisbon, to the glorious inside forward of Manchester United, to the complete central striker of Real Madrid, to the restrained, goal-hungry version of his late years at the same club. Right now we are in fifth-wave Ronaldo: the imperial goal-hammer years. It works, too. Ronaldo\u2019s movement has dropped but the returns are still there. In that hat-trick game against Switzerland there was even a sense of Ronaldo digging deep in his playbook and finding some of his old standards, most obviously in one vintage retro-dribble past Kevin Mbabu on the touchline. Perhaps there is even an element of calculation here. Ronaldo will be up against Virgil Van Dijk on Sunday night. Van Dijk has already shown against Harry Kane that he will win most attempts to wrestle or play at close quarters. Running, dribbling, attacking at unusual angles: these will be useful tools. Ronaldo still has it in him. How he attempts to play Van Dijk will be fascinating. That duel has been a key strand in the buildup. Not that anyone knows what Ronaldo really thinks about any of this. He remains behind the veil, communicating only with Uefa in gobbets of football-speak inanity, confined by the pressure of those ongoing rape charges in the US. It is another point of pressure. There are those who maintain the accusations against Ronaldo should be mentioned every time he plays, so serious is the charge. On the other hand, it is possible to applaud his victim for having the courage to speak out \u2013 Ronaldo is powerful person with a powerful machine behind him \u2013 while still respecting due process, just as Ronaldo is innocent until the law decides otherwise. For now the case has become another strand in his unusual degree of remoteness. Beyond that opaque public face Ronaldo has always been distant. It is a remarkable feat of obscurity in itself, another statement of his personal power. Ronaldo can do things such as attempting to claim half of the tiny dressing room at Iceland\u2019s Laugardalsv\u00f6llur stadium solely for himself before kick-off in a European qualifier, but still retain at all times the total respect of his teammates. This is a fine Portugal team, too. Neves-Carvalho-Silva is a midfield to go deep into any tournament. Jo\u00e3o F\u00e9lix offers vast attacking promise. Still though the focus, the sense of drive and destiny will come from the man at the front, an icon of the age who continues even now to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield.",

They will apparently be able to travel up to 15 miles and carry packages weighing up to 2.3kg.",

Taking the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/oct/08/merylstreep.comedy\" title=\"\">Devil Wears Prada</a> model of the outsider who finds herself in a closed-circle work environment and proceeds to shake things up, the film places Molly (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/31/mindy-kaling-i-was-so-embarrassed-about-being-a-diversity-hire\" title=\"\">Mindy Kaling</a>, who also penned the screenplay), a female Indian-American chemical plant worker, within the comedy bro banter hothouse of a writer\u2019s room for a late-night TV chatshow. The show, hosted by the formidable Katherine Newbury (Thompson) is sliding in the ratings and threatened with cancellation; even so, the complacent boys\u2019 club members who churn out the same tired, old material are dismissive of Molly, sneering that she\u2019s little more than a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s amusing enough, and the girl-crush platonic romance between Molly and her unwilling mentor Katherine gives the film more heart then any of the casual hookups with male cast members. It\u2019s just a pity there\u2019s nothing in the writing as sharp as Thompson\u2019s suits. Like Molly herself, the screenplay is prone to earnest oversharing at the worst possible moments. The lack of diversity in entertainment is an open goal, long overdue for a skewering. But rather than kicking over the traces of the patriarchal establishment, the film ends up just giving it a playful tickle.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxefiCjQirw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DxefiCjQirw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/DxefiCjQirw\">Watch a trailer for Late Night</a>.</figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s much to love about this sparky US entertainment industry satire, not least the fact that it contains Emma Thompson wearing a razor-tailored tuxedo and swearing her face off. Taking the Devil Wears Prada model of the outsider who finds herself in a closed-circle work environment and proceeds to shake things up, the film places Molly (Mindy Kaling, who also penned the screenplay), a female Indian-American chemical plant worker, within the comedy bro banter hothouse of a writer\u2019s room for a late-night TV chatshow. The show, hosted by the formidable Katherine Newbury (Thompson) is sliding in the ratings and threatened with cancellation; even so, the complacent boys\u2019 club members who churn out the same tired, old material are dismissive of Molly, sneering that she\u2019s little more than a \u201cdiversity hire\u201d. It\u2019s amusing enough, and the girl-crush platonic romance between Molly and her unwilling mentor Katherine gives the film more heart then any of the casual hookups with male cast members. It\u2019s just a pity there\u2019s nothing in the writing as sharp as Thompson\u2019s suits. Like Molly herself, the screenplay is prone to earnest oversharing at the worst possible moments. The lack of diversity in entertainment is an open goal, long overdue for a skewering. But rather than kicking over the traces of the patriarchal establishment, the film ends up just giving it a playful tickle.",

      "body": "<p>One of the \u201cattractions\u201d of <strong>Sergei Polunin</strong>\u2019s week-long run at the London Palladium \u2013 part of an epic week for London dance lovers \u2013 was an opportunity for mega-fans to go backstage for 10 minutes, to talk to their hero and take a selfie. They paid \u00a3400 for the privilege, and no doubt they felt it was worth it. They buy into the myth of the misunderstood, embattled genius.</p> <p>But it is getting harder to see Polunin in that light. In his second programme he danced the title character in <em>Rasputin</em>, all staring eyes and despair in a new full-length piece for five dancers by Yuka Oishi that is full of emoting and not much else. Polunin\u2019s innate talent, however ragged it now is round the edges, is not well served by a noisy (cacophonous score by Kirill Richter), empty work that requires so little of him. Oishi\u2019s choreography is so thin it feels reductive; the chessboard setting by Otto Buben\u00cd\u010dek looks like a throwback to the 1930s.

      "bodyText": "One of the \u201cattractions\u201d of Sergei Polunin\u2019s week-long run at the London Palladium \u2013 part of an epic week for London dance lovers \u2013 was an opportunity for mega-fans to go backstage for 10 minutes, to talk to their hero and take a selfie. They paid \u00a3400 for the privilege, and no doubt they felt it was worth it. They buy into the myth of the misunderstood, embattled genius. But it is getting harder to see Polunin in that light. In his second programme he danced the title character in Rasputin, all staring eyes and despair in a new full-length piece for five dancers by Yuka Oishi that is full of emoting and not much else. Polunin\u2019s innate talent, however ragged it now is round the edges, is not well served by a noisy (cacophonous score by Kirill Richter), empty work that requires so little of him. Oishi\u2019s choreography is so thin it feels reductive; the chessboard setting by Otto Buben\u00cd\u010dek looks like a throwback to the 1930s. The only moment that had any real impact was a tender healing duet with the young Tsarevich (Djordje Kalenic; wonderful). With such fare, Polunin hardly furthers his aim \u201cto evolve and integrate ballet into mass culture\u201d. Ironically, it feels more old-fashioned in his hands than it does in the current triple bill being offered by his old alma mater the Royal Ballet. This opens with Fokine\u2019s The Firebird, a ballet that, when premiered in 1910 by Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes, was as radical as they come with its stirring Stravinsky score.

Ratmansky is so full of ideas: whether it is the arm pumping, breezy attack of the boys in Symphony #9, or the sense of melancholy autobiographical struggle that animates Chamber Symphony, or the dipping little lifts that find the swoon in the sounds of the piano concerto, his rapturous inventiveness is so great, it is moving.

At 32, she will retort with a show of almost 800 pictures in defiance of her censors, right in the middle of Moscow. Here she stands, before a wall of her own works, justifiably holding up a triumphant bouquet of yellow lilies.</p> <p>It is a stirring start to this inspirational show at <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/natalia-goncharova\" title=\"\">Tate Modern</a>, the first survey of Goncharova\u2019s art ever to be mounted in Britain. And it gives you, straight away, the painter and her persona \u2013 zestful, energetic, with a direct and exuberant touch. In her long life, Goncharova (1881-1962) worked her way through so many different idioms that contemporary Russian critics sometimes wondered who she was exactly and where to find her. But it seems clear that they only needed to look at the sheer strength and joy of her brushwork.</p> <p>It is there in the oars of a rowing boat, setting the blue waters flashing around them; and in the brilliant green parrots, bright-eyed on a branch. It is there in a tremendous painting of stocky legs, treading the grapes in a barrel, already wine-dark with juice. Above all, it\u2019s in the staggeringly robust scene of two wrestlers in trunks, headlong in the impasse of their solidly interlocking forms, Goncharova\u2019s paint rising at every level to their full-strength force.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85871a501fe112cb61b85fa905b0912ddfa4c772\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85871a501fe112cb61b85fa905b0912ddfa4c772/0_0_3842_5180/742.jpg\" alt=\"Natalia Goncharova\u2019s Self-Portrait with Yellow Lilies, 1907-1908\" width=\"742\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalia Goncharova\u2019s Self-Portrait with Yellow Lilies, 1907-1908.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP, Paris and DACS, London 2019</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Goncharova was born in Tula province to a family of noble lineage. Her father\u2019s family connected directly back to Pushkin, whose novels she would one day illustrate. At art school in Moscow, she met her partner Mikhail Larionov, and they worked together through upheavals in Russia, exile in Paris, ill-health and intermittent poverty until the end of their days. Goncharova once punched a man for calling her Mrs Larionov, and not because she was the more famous. In Russia, as in practically no other art scene before the first world war, men and women could be equals.</p> <p>That scene was exceptionally international, modernism flowing east and west in both directions. The large painting called <em>The Smoker</em>, from 1911, obviously takes off from looking hard at C\u00e9zanne but sends the subject straight back to Russia. With his ochre face and oval eyes, hammer hand holding the pipe, this man has overtones of traditional tray painting. And in Goncharova\u2019s early paintings, the eyes are often like fishes; fishes as religious as the loaves stacked on harvest tables beneath groaning apple trees in a kind of Russian Eden. Even when Goncharova paints a fauve-bright orchard, with yellow trees above a green and orange ground, there are peasants in traditional Russian costumes waiting to catch the fruit.</p> <p>Goncharova and Larionov moved to Paris in 1916 to work for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes. There they met Picasso, Braque, the dadaists and surrealists. Even before that, in an exhilarating picture of <a href=\"http://en.rusmuseum.ru/collections/painting-of-the-second-half-of-the-xix-century-beginning-of-xxi-century/artworks/velosipedist/\" title=\"\">a cyclist</a> hurtling through a blizzard of signs \u2013 pointing fingers, buzzing numbers, Cyrillic writing \u2013 Goncharova shows her excitement with futurism. But she is just as likely to be painting quasi-mystical scenes. In a painting of deep winter, peasants lugging firewood, the fir trees \u2013 or is it the skies; or is it Mother Russia herself \u2013 are all exploding in starry white flowers.</p> <p>There is a characteristic overlap of past and present. Scything, harvesting, dancing, Russian Orthodox candelabras: all may be mixed up with high modernism. And then Goncharova will paint a Moscow street scene \u2013 women in modish new hats, early biplanes hovering overhead \u2013 with an almost regressive primitivism.</p> <p>In Paris, with money growing tighter, she designed clothes, posters, apartment interiors. This show rightly sidesteps the late repetitions of her early radicalism, with nothing but ballet costumes from the 1930s onwards. But even those costumes speak of her marvellous verve \u2013 and the jubilant cadmium orange that she made her own colour.</p> <p>It always comes straight from the tube, as if she hadn\u2019t time to fiddle about mixing hues. You see it in the massive and ultra-modern <em>Bathers</em>, from 1922, flaring up the canvas; in the apples and oars and the parrots\u2019 tails. There are hints of it in that bouquet of lilies. It is as expressive as the firm strokes of her brush, full of joy and integrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a4fb71fb1f5f6ce550c69834eb5783d1a07eb86e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4fb71fb1f5f6ce550c69834eb5783d1a07eb86e/0_0_1817_2101/865.jpg\" alt=\"Natalia Goncharova\u2019s Linen, 1913.\" width=\"865\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natalia Goncharova\u2019s Linen, 1913.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 ADAGP/DACS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Goncharova\u2019s best works entered the Tate collection during her lifetime. <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/goncharova-linen-n06194\" title=\"\"><em>Linen</em></a> is the sparkling celebration of a laundry window, men\u2019s shirts to one side, women\u2019s underwear to the other, a brilliant blue sharpening the pervasive whiteness.

Like Goncharova, Krasner is resilient, industrious, courageous; her powerful skeins and whorls writ large on vast, balletic canvases that compel the eye and seduce the mind, swooping and leaping like live conversation.</p> <p>And like Goncharova, Krasner makes no special plea about gender. Born Lena, she changed her name to the androgynous Lee and refused to participate in Peggy Guggenheim\u2019s famous Women show in 1943.

You can go back more than a century and you will not find another case of an MP being returned at a byelection with a vote share as meagre as 30.9%. A win is a win, and the hissing sound you can hear is some air escaping from Nigel Farage\u2019s balloon, but this was an incredibly narrow squeak. My one-stop shop for excellent electoral facts, David Cowling, has looked at every other byelection since 1918 and cannot find one in which the winner had the support of such a small minority of voters.</p> <p>Peterborough used to be a classic two-way marginal. The reds and the blues slugged it out and the other parties were spectators. As recently as the 2017 election, the combined Labour-Tory vote share was 95%. That shrank to just 52% in the byelection. This reinforces the message from the national opinion polls. The British electoral cake is now dividing up in a way that is without precedent. We have a four-plus party system with support split between the Tories, Labour, the Brexit party and the Lib Dems, plus a segment for the Greens. In Scotland and Wales, the nationalists make it a five-plus party system. It is not too much of a stretch to argue that we are really in a six- to seven-plus party system. The Conservatives contain within them at least two parties. The One Nation group of Tories would select a very different leader to the Moggite European Research Group. Labour is another unhappy marriage of ideological traditions that would be separated into different parties in other countries.</p> <p>No explanation for this great fragmentation can fail to mention Brexit. On the defining issue of the day, neither Labour nor the Tories have managed to articulate a position that is capable of marshalling the support of the majority of the country. But Brexit did not do this all by itself. Rather, it has been the accelerant of a fire that was already consuming the traditional political structures.</p> <p>There has been a decades-long decline in support for Britain\u2019s two main parties, as we used to call Labour and the Tories. Back in 1951, when the red-blue duopoly was at its strongest, the vast majority of voters identified with one or the other and their combined vote share exceeded 96%. You were a member of a tiny, marginal and mocked minority \u2013 in other words, a Liberal \u2013 if you voted for someone else. There has since been remorseless decay in support for the two old tribes, a decline only temporarily masked by a deceptive upwards blip in 2017.</p> <p>Both have warnings from history that no party, however long it has been around, has a divine right to rule \u2013 or even to exist. Tories who fear that they are facing an extinction event have the example of the Progressive Conservatives of Canada, who collapsed from governing party to just two seats in the 1990s. Labour has a harbinger closer to home in the near obliteration of its once mighty cohort of Scottish MPs.</p> <p>There are some things that the blues and the reds can do to try to staunch the bleeding. Leadership is the obvious issue to address. Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are a rare combination of negatives: one of the most unpopular prime ministers there has ever been and one of the most unpopular leaders of the opposition there has ever been. Mrs May\u2019s departure is allowing the Tories to indulge in their favourite hobby, a leadership contest. While this festival of fantasies is under way, they can have a dreamy few weeks imagining that installing a different tribal chief is the answer to their many problems. This will get them through until July when this consoling delusion will then collide with the reality that a new leader is not going to be able to negotiate a miraculously improved Brexit or ram a crash-out Brexit through a parliament that won\u2019t have it. The official opposition has no plans to change its leader so Labour has to tell itself that the country is suffering from false consciousness about Jeremy Corbyn and will come round to the idea of him as prime minister in the end.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A lot of Britons say they do not like hung parliaments, but they created one in 2010 and again in 2017</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is possible, even probable, that the reds and the blues will claw back some support before or during a general election campaign. Local elections, Euro elections and byelections are often poor predictors of how voters will behave when given the different task of selecting a government. The old two have historically been successful at squeezing the other parties at general elections by contending that choosing anyone else is a \u201cwasted vote\u201d. The argument of the lesser evil \u2013 we know you think we\u2019re awful, but the other lot are even worse \u2013 can also be exploited in a first-past-the-post system. But there are good grounds for thinking that this may no longer be so effective.</p> <p>The red-blue duopoly has depended on voters being psychological hostages of the idea that the choice at general elections is a binary one. They lose that grip on the minds of the electorate when challenger parties have a credible chance of securing representation. Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University, has coined a neat name for this phenomenon. He calls it the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/uk/2019/06/tinkerbell-effect-british-politics-brink-brexit-realignment\" title=\"\">Tinkerbell effect</a>\u201d. If people stop believing the old parties are invincible, they become beatable. If people start believing that challenger parties can win, that belief becomes self-fulfilling.</p> <p>Many of our continental neighbours have had <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/britain-has-never-been-more-european-elections-2019-brexit-party-lib-dems/\" title=\"\">multi-party competition</a> for decades and some commentators note the irony of Brexit Britain becoming <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/13/brexit-has-broken-system-prepare-european-style-realignment/\" title=\"\">more European in its politics</a>. Yet there is this critical difference. Most of our neighbours have proportional electoral systems designed to translate multi-party contests into fair parliamentary representation. They also have years of experience of how to form coalition governments and what to expect from them.</p> <p>Britain has a multi-party politics trapped in the decrepit body of first past the post. The new politics is trying to express itself through an archaic electoral system designed to work with only two contenders. The full consequences of this are not entirely knowable, but we can hazard a guess that it is going to amplify unpredictability and may contain some scary implications for our democracy.</p> <p>One potential outcome is that neither the Tories nor Labour will be able to secure a Commons majority for the foreseeable future. A lot of Britons say they do not like hung parliaments, but they created one in 2010 and again in 2017 and they will have to learn to live with hung parliaments if they keep on doing this. In the event that this is the future, we will face years of paralysis under feeble governments unable to do a great deal unless the British political class becomes much more skilled at building alliances across party lines and much more willing to work towards consensus.</p> <p>There is another, and more alarming, version of the future. This is that an electoral system incompatible with multi-party politics produces governments that are wildly unrepresentative of what the nation voted for. When you feed multi-party politics through a first-past-the-post system you can end up with some extremely unappetising results.</p> <p>The four-way split of the vote in Peterborough means that all of that city is now represented by an MP who won with less than a third of the vote. This could be replayed on a national scale. At a general election, there could be scores of Peterboroughs. The scenario to terrify Tories is that they and the Farage vehicle split the conservative and pro-Brexit vote. This puts Mr Corbyn into Number 10 with a very low vote share but a substantial parliamentary majority for a radical left programme. One thing that unites all the contenders for the Conservative leadership is that their party cannot risk a general election so long as they are confronted with this threat.</p> <p>It is also possible to envisage a scenario that would be deeply disturbing for progressives. A hard Brexit leader pulls together the third or so of the electorate who want to quit the EU without a deal. Though he is a long way short of possessing a mandate from most of the country, this leader manages to sneak to a parliamentary majority because the opposition is divided.</p> <p>In either case, Britain finds itself with a highly divisive prime minister heading a government intent on pursuing a hugely contentious project without the endorsement of the great majority of the electorate. The legitimacy of such a government would be challenged from its first day in office and we would look back wistfully on Theresa May as a prime minister who presided over a golden age of tranquillity.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",

This will get them through until July when this consoling delusion will then collide with the reality that a new leader is not going to be able to negotiate a miraculously improved Brexit or ram a crash-out Brexit through a parliament that won\u2019t have it. The official opposition has no plans to change its leader so Labour has to tell itself that the country is suffering from false consciousness about Jeremy Corbyn and will come round to the idea of him as prime minister in the end. It is possible, even probable, that the reds and the blues will claw back some support before or during a general election campaign. Local elections, Euro elections and byelections are often poor predictors of how voters will behave when given the different task of selecting a government. The old two have historically been successful at squeezing the other parties at general elections by contending that choosing anyone else is a \u201cwasted vote\u201d. The argument of the lesser evil \u2013 we know you think we\u2019re awful, but the other lot are even worse \u2013 can also be exploited in a first-past-the-post system. But there are good grounds for thinking that this may no longer be so effective. The red-blue duopoly has depended on voters being psychological hostages of the idea that the choice at general elections is a binary one. They lose that grip on the minds of the electorate when challenger parties have a credible chance of securing representation. Rob Ford, professor of politics at Manchester University, has coined a neat name for this phenomenon. He calls it the \u201cTinkerbell effect\u201d. If people stop believing the old parties are invincible, they become beatable. If people start believing that challenger parties can win, that belief becomes self-fulfilling. Many of our continental neighbours have had multi-party competition for decades and some commentators note the irony of Brexit Britain becoming more European in its politics. Yet there is this critical difference. Most of our neighbours have proportional electoral systems designed to translate multi-party contests into fair parliamentary representation. They also have years of experience of how to form coalition governments and what to expect from them. Britain has a multi-party politics trapped in the decrepit body of first past the post. The new politics is trying to express itself through an archaic electoral system designed to work with only two contenders. The full consequences of this are not entirely knowable, but we can hazard a guess that it is going to amplify unpredictability and may contain some scary implications for our democracy. One potential outcome is that neither the Tories nor Labour will be able to secure a Commons majority for the foreseeable future. A lot of Britons say they do not like hung parliaments, but they created one in 2010 and again in 2017 and they will have to learn to live with hung parliaments if they keep on doing this. In the event that this is the future, we will face years of paralysis under feeble governments unable to do a great deal unless the British political class becomes much more skilled at building alliances across party lines and much more willing to work towards consensus. There is another, and more alarming, version of the future. This is that an electoral system incompatible with multi-party politics produces governments that are wildly unrepresentative of what the nation voted for. When you feed multi-party politics through a first-past-the-post system you can end up with some extremely unappetising results. The four-way split of the vote in Peterborough means that all of that city is now represented by an MP who won with less than a third of the vote. This could be replayed on a national scale. At a general election, there could be scores of Peterboroughs. The scenario to terrify Tories is that they and the Farage vehicle split the conservative and pro-Brexit vote. This puts Mr Corbyn into Number 10 with a very low vote share but a substantial parliamentary majority for a radical left programme. One thing that unites all the contenders for the Conservative leadership is that their party cannot risk a general election so long as they are confronted with this threat. It is also possible to envisage a scenario that would be deeply disturbing for progressives. A hard Brexit leader pulls together the third or so of the electorate who want to quit the EU without a deal. Though he is a long way short of possessing a mandate from most of the country, this leader manages to sneak to a parliamentary majority because the opposition is divided. In either case, Britain finds itself with a highly divisive prime minister heading a government intent on pursuing a hugely contentious project without the endorsement of the great majority of the electorate. The legitimacy of such a government would be challenged from its first day in office and we would look back wistfully on Theresa May as a prime minister who presided over a golden age of tranquillity. \u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer",

      "body": "<p>While he was an undergraduate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/03/ocean-vuong-forward-prize-vietnam-war-saigon-night-sky-with-exit-wounds\" title=\"\">Ocean Vuong</a> formed the habit of writing at night. During the day, he studied literature at Brooklyn College and worked in a cafe. At night, he stayed up writing poems. It wasn\u2019t just the sense of isolation that comes from being the only one awake, when \u201cyou look out of the window and it\u2019s completely dark and you\u2019re at sea in this little ship\u201d. It was more that writing in the off-hours relaxed his knack for self-criticism. \u201cYou get the last word of the day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe editor in your head \u2013 the nagging, insecure, worrisome social editor \u2013 starts to retire. When that editor falls asleep, I get to do what I want. The cat\u2019s out to play.\u201d</p> <p>The poems that came out of those night-time efforts were published in 2016 as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/09/night-sky-with-exit-wounds-ocean-vuong-review\" title=\"\"><em>Night Sky </em><em>With Exit Wounds</em></a>, the success of which still amazes the author \u2013 the book won a <a href=\"https://www.whiting.org/awards/winners/ocean-vuong#/\" title=\"\">Whiting award</a> that year, and in 2017 scooped both the <a href=\"http://www.forwardartsfoundation.org/2017-forward-prizes-winners/\" title=\"\">Forward prize</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/15/ts-eliot-prize-goes-to-ocean-vuongs-compellingly-assured-debut-collection\" title=\"\">TS Eliot prize</a>. Vuong, who is 30, was not from a background from which writers traditionally emerge. As a two-year-old, he had been brought to the US from Vietnam as a refugee and settled with his family in the working-class town of Hartford, Connecticut. No one in his family spoke English. When his father left, his mother got work in a nail salon, menial work for little reward and a quality of life that Vuong had no particular expectation of exceeding. If <em>Night Sky</em> tackled the absent father as myth, then his debut novel, <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/600633/on-earth-were-briefly-gorgeous-by-ocean-vuong/9780525562023/\" title=\"\"><em>On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</em></a>, reckons with the mother and grandmother who raised him and it is the influence of these women \u2013 courageous, difficult, devastated by the ripple effect of the Vietnam war \u2013 that forms the spine of the novel and asks the central question: after trauma, how do we love?</p> <p>We are in Vuong\u2019s open-plan living room in Northampton, Massachusetts, a leafy college town where he teaches creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Peter, his partner of 10 years, has taken the dog out. Vuong is slight, with a silver earring in one ear and the habit of pushing his tortoiseshell glasses up his nose. He speaks, as he writes, in poetic imagery, what he calls \u201cthe metaphor as autobiography of the gaze\u201d. In the novel, the world seen through a speeding car window \u201csurges by like sidewise gravity\u201d. A bird on a windowsill appears not as a bucolic symbol but \u201ca charred pear\u201d. To Little Dog, the protagonist \u2013 so named by his family to protect him beneath a cloak of worthlessness \u2013 the world is an ugly place, in which beauty is made more so for the improbability of existing at all. \u201cFreedom,\u201d he says, \u201cis nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey.\u201d</p> <p>That <em>On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</em> is one of the most anticipated novels of the year \u2013 the novelist Max Porter has called it \u201cstaggeringly beautiful\u201d, observing that \u201cit seems obvious now that a gay young poet born in Saigon would write the great American novel\u201d \u2013 is, in large part, down to its perfect engineering, a piece of autobiographical fiction that avoids all the traps of that genre. It is fluid, moving the way thought moves, in circles not lines, and written in the form of a letter to Little Dog\u2019s mother that he knows she\u2019ll never read. It is easy to imagine a bad version of this novel in which any one of its preoccupations might have overgrown to capsize it. It might have been the Opioid Novel, or the Vietnam Novel, or the Exploitative World of the Nail Salon novel. It might have been the Gay Adolescent Love novel or the Violent Childhood novel, all themes that are touched upon lightly while still assuming a fully weighted presence in the narrative. How Vuong does this is a mystery, as is the seamlessness with which he moves between scenes of violence in the Vietnam war to scenes of violence in the home in Connecticut, to love scenes with a doomed boy called Trevor. The book has a poetic density that is at once elliptical and unflinching in its gaze, a testimony to the endlessly complicated dynamics of damage. \u201cSometimes being offered tenderness,\u201d writes Vuong, \u201cfeels like the very proof that you\u2019ve been ruined.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ebb2b3a263a232eb6a9a50584bb3acd52cd6ae1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ebb2b3a263a232eb6a9a50584bb3acd52cd6ae1b/0_77_602_860/350.jpg\" alt=\"Ocean Vuong aged two with his aunt and mother at a Philippines refugee camp\" width=\"350\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ocean Vuong aged two with his aunt and mother at a Philippines refugee camp.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: -</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Vuong grew up in a world in which he was marginalised across every axis \u2013 class, race, sexuality. His was a violent household. In a memoir piece he wrote for the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/a-letter-to-my-mother-that-she-will-never-read\" title=\"\"><em>New Yorker</em></a> two years ago, which would form the basis of many scenes in the novel, Vuong, addressing his mother, recalled \u201cthe time you hit me with the remote control. A bruise I would lie about to my teachers. I fell playing tag.\u201d And,\u201cthe time you threw the box of Legos at my head. The hardwood dotted with blood.\u201d And, \u201cthe time with a gallon of milk. A shattering on the side of my head, then the steady white rain on the kitchen tiles.\u201d</p> <p>Post-traumatic stress disorder was something no one had any idea about at the time, \u201cexcept in veterans\u201d. But there is no question, looking back, that both his grandmother, who saw her village in Vietnam razed by US soldiers, and his mother, ripped from everything familiar for a new life in the US, where her husband beat her before leaving, were suffering from PTSD. Violence was the ugly expression of this trauma, but with distance, Vuong could see a positive release of that energy, too \u2013 chiefly in the way that his mother and grandmother told stories.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know this until I talked to other Vietnamese-Americans \u2013 that it was rare for families to talk about the war,\u201d he says. Partly it came out of boredom. They were broke, stuck in the house with each other and \u201cwe had no TV\u201d. But there was something else going on, too. \u201cThe stories, at first, were folklore. My grandmother would tell a ghost story, then she would say: oh, that was after the napalm. So through cycles of these stories, that world started opening and as a child I would ask: what\u2019s napalm? They ploughed on. It was almost intoxicating for them to create a mythology of their lives, because they were so powerless. They were all women. The men were gone; they did their harm and were gone. And they were empty hands, had no English, were powerless everywhere else. But when it was time to tell the story, they held everything.\u201d</p> <p>Vuong had no context for what he was hearing. He only knew that in the stories, these women who counted for nothing outside, ran through the fire and survived. \u201cThey turned themselves into myths and it had a rhetorical power. They turned themselves into the Odyssey.\u201d</p> <p>In the novel, the trauma of Little Dog\u2019s mother and grandmother shines through in grimly humorous ways. Lan, the grandmother, yelling at his addled mother to get back in the car, shouts to get through to her, \u201cget back in the helicopter\u201d. Buying a dress from the Salvation Army, his mother asks Little Dog to read the label and find out, \u201cis it fireproof?\u201d In the family mythology, Vuong was the single last hope of these indestructible women and when, in the mid-2000s, Hartford was hit by the opioid epidemic, it\u2019s the thing that stopped him from leaning towards drugs. \u201cA lot of my friends were dying. And I thought: OK, I can die.\u201d Worn out by poverty, bullying, bereavement and violence, he regarded this outcome as regrettable, but \u201cI think that might not have been enough, were it not for me being my family \u2019s only hope. Because they were also dying, in a different way: financially, mentally. And I thought, I can\u2019t die. Literally I can\u2019t die.\u201d He wanted to change his family\u2019s story. He wanted to make his mother happy. He wanted to exceed the expectations of someone born to his station in life.</p> <p>So what did he do?</p> <p>He smiles. \u201cI went to business school.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c149252a4dae24423036445c993b467414d983e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c149252a4dae24423036445c993b467414d983e8/0_32_800_480/500.jpg\" alt=\"Alongside Andrew Marr, Ian Patterson and Sin\u00e9ad Morrissey after winning a Forward prize in 2017.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alongside Andrew Marr, Ian Patterson and Sin\u00e9ad Morrissey after winning a Forward prize in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adrian Pope</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a year in early adulthood when Vuong and his mother didn\u2019t speak. He knew life had been hard for her, leaving Vietnam and dealing with his father, about whom he knows very little other than that after his mother kicked him out, he \u201cwent off to do criminal things and ended up going to jail\u201d. But he hadn\u2019t yet got to the stage of forgiving her. \u201cIt was the worst, for both of us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when we looked at each other again, we just sobbed and said: oh, we can\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve got to find a way.\u201d This happened before Vuong had written a single line, and it was important; \u201ca pivotal moment to understand that anger destroys, not only those around you, but especially yourself. Anger is energy \u2013 you can get a lot done with anger; you can write multiple books. We\u2019ve read those books and you realise as you\u2019re reading them: oh, this is not for me. It\u2019s their own project. So I didn\u2019t want to write angry. I didn\u2019t want to be angry. I saw what anger did, growing up, and it was powerful, a force to be reckoned with, but it didn\u2019t lead to anywhere that I was interested in going.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t the received wisdom among many of those applying to study creative writing at college, where it is sometimes assumed that having something to rage about is a definite advantage. After eight weeks at business school \u2013 which he characterises as \u201clearning to lie\u201d \u2013 Vuong dropped out and enrolled to read literature at Brooklyn College. He started to write poetry. And then he had an unsettling experience.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A student on a prestigious writing programme said to Vuong: 'You\u2019re so lucky \u2013 you\u2019re gay and from war'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Freshly arrived in New York, he turned up at a poetry reading one night, pretty sure he was about to \u201cmeet my people\u201d, having spent the previous two decades as a fish out of water. \u201cAnd the first thing someone said to me was: hey, I\u2019m at Sarah Lawrence, where are you studying? And I said: oh, I\u2019m not in an MFA [master of fine arts]. And he just turned around and walked off.\u201d He bursts out laughing. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d Another student on a prestigious writing programme chatted to Vuong for a few moments, before saying: \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky \u2013 you\u2019re gay and from war.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of Vuong\u2019s childhood as a generator of great material for fiction is one that makes him laugh like a drain. These days, if any of his upper-middle-class students grouse that they don\u2019t have a good backstory, he mildly points out that Virginia Woolf got one of the best novels ever written out of someone basically crossing a lawn. At the time, however, he was shocked and disappointed. He hadn\u2019t been prepared for the merciless competition of the New York poetry crowd \u201cwhich depended on appearances, soirees and parties. So I just holed up in my apartment and the library.\u201d His confidence cratered. He wondered if he\u2019d made a terrible mistake. Then he hit upon an unexpected remedy. \u201cA huge moment in my education as a writer was reading biographies. I beg my students to do it, because everything that they\u2019re feeling, Sylvia Plath felt 70 years ago. And Ginsburg and Lorca and Rimbaud. There\u2019s Virginia Woolf, this genius, who\u2019s going on a crisis walk. You read the prose and you would never think this woman has any doubt. And yet here she is, out there, asking: what am I doing?\u201d</p> <p>Vuong thinks he was lucky in some ways. \u201cI had no pressure. I could really experiment with my voice. I could play, and find pleasure in it. I see with my students that they\u2019re under a lot of pressure from their families. A parent will say to me: \u201cmy future Pulitzer winner!\u201d and I just groan. Poor kid. What do you say to that?\u201d</p> <p>He started going to open mic poetry events, which were shabbier and more democratic than formal readings, and at one of which he met a law student called Peter. To that point, Vuong\u2019s relationships had been largely dysfunctional, \u201cbad, bad relationships in almost this cliched trope of seeing what\u2019s familiar in violent, self-destructive folks\u201d. His horizons had been limited in other ways, too. It is an odd side-effect of poverty that you become trapped in a previous era, he says; new things take longer to arrive, and when they do, no one has time to absorb them. \u201cYou don\u2019t have no time. That\u2019s the thing everybody in my community says: I ain\u2019t got no time for that!\u201d He laughs. \u201cBeing poor is about waiting, I learned. You\u2019re waiting in line for welfare. You go to the ER, you wait. You want to file for sexual assault? You wait. And so everybody\u2019s in a queue and one thing that happens is that you\u2019re in a cultural time warp. You\u2019re in the past. So when I went to New York in 2007, I had no iPhone, no Facebook; in my community, when it comes to technology and access, they are mostly in the late 90s.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"29360f7be02cfedfc077c286557a021a9ab31743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29360f7be02cfedfc077c286557a021a9ab31743/0_28_413_576/359.jpg\" alt=\"Ocean Vuong and his mother\" width=\"359\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ocean Vuong and his mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy:  Ocean Vuong</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They were also culturally fairly regressive, although in his own home at least, homophobia was one of Vuong\u2019s lesser problems. (There is a heartbreaking bit in the novel in which Little Dog wakes to find \u201cFAG4LIFE\u201d scrawled on his family\u2019s front door in red paint and he tells his mum that it reads: \u201cMerry Christmas, Ma. See? That\u2019s why it\u2019s red. For luck.\u201d) When he was growing up, his mother and grandmother weren\u2019t thrilled by his sexuality, but \u201cbecause they came from a long line of rice farmers, they were close to native traditions in Vietnam, and those communities had intersex folks who were seen as having all-seeing power. They were powerful people and there was a mysticism associated with that. That doesn\u2019t mean they hoped their children would be queer. But although they were shocked, they had a very practical way of looking at things. That\u2019s what I admired about them. Their view is that this is borrowed time. We should\u2019ve been gone up in smoke. But now we\u2019re here, let\u2019s just live.\u201d</p> <p>The downside to this attitude was economic ruin. \u201cIt leads to financial woes and bankruptcy. Maxed-out credit cards.\u201d He\u2019s laughing now. \u201cOK, after 20 years, the party\u2019s over! Let\u2019s think about savings! They\u2019re all in financial ruts because they had that mentality.\u201d</p> <p>It was a joyfulness, or at least a somewhat constructive outlook, that Vuong associates with women who emerge from trauma as opposed to destructive and self-destructing men. It still amazes him, looking back, how the women in his family \u2013 his mother, his grandmother, his aunts \u2013 dealt with the threat of their husbands. \u201cThe incredible thing that I can never quite understand was how they were able to kick them all out. The men had access to jobs, money, a patriarchal presence in the world, and even though they had troubles too, as immigrants and refugees, we come from a patriarchal tradition in the old country just as deeply rooted as in the west. In some cases, when men are talking to each other, women aren\u2019t supposed to even be in the room. So that was what they were coming out of. And to think divorce?! These things were still taboo where they came from. And they all really did it.\u201d</p> <p>The question of courage underlines everything Vuong writes, both in terms of the characters and in the nerve held by the writer creating them. <em>Night Sky With Exit Wounds</em>, published when he was 27, and which \u201ctook off in ways that no poet ever suspects will happen, and should not expect again\u201d, dared to imagine scenes in which brutality and sensuality combined. (In one scene, the poet describes his father masturbating in a bathroom after he has beaten his mother, observing \u201cthat a man in climax is the closest thing to surrender\u201d.) The novel has a similarly shocking breadth of sympathies. In both, Vuong\u2019s ultimate aim was to dignify the experiences of his childhood with the solemn, years-long gaze of the novelist.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I wanted to say: these lives, of women, and even of poor white people \u2013 these lives are worthy of literature</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe great male writers of the European tradition, be it Proust, Tolstoy, Turgenev, deemed that those most inspiring to them existed in a white aristocracy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou read those books and you wouldn\u2019t even know that people of colour existed in Europe. To each his own, and that was their choice. But I wanted to say: these lives, of women, and even of poor white people \u2013 these lives are worthy of literature. As Turgenev looked at the crumbling Russian empire, I look at these folks in a different crumbling empire and deemed that these are inspiring lives to an artist.\u201d</p> <p>He also wanted to say something about where the cost of war falls, not from the vantage point of the grand historical epic, but from inside the small, cramped sadness of a house still flattened decades after the conflict has ended. \u201cIt\u2019s the stories of our species that men create these wars and women clean them up. They clean them up emotionally, they have to deal with the PTSD that comes home, they have to postpone their own healing, forgo their own self-care, in order to hold these households together. They literally nurse these broken bodies back to health. I wanted a book to honour that without romanticising it. To say women have been doing this and they\u2019re not necessarily these heroic legends. What\u2019s the mental cost of the women who do these extraordinary things?

      "bodyText": "While he was an undergraduate, Ocean Vuong formed the habit of writing at night. During the day, he studied literature at Brooklyn College and worked in a cafe. At night, he stayed up writing poems. It wasn\u2019t just the sense of isolation that comes from being the only one awake, when \u201cyou look out of the window and it\u2019s completely dark and you\u2019re at sea in this little ship\u201d. It was more that writing in the off-hours relaxed his knack for self-criticism. \u201cYou get the last word of the day,\u201d he says. \u201cThe editor in your head \u2013 the nagging, insecure, worrisome social editor \u2013 starts to retire. When that editor falls asleep, I get to do what I want. The cat\u2019s out to play.\u201d The poems that came out of those night-time efforts were published in 2016 as Night Sky With Exit Wounds, the success of which still amazes the author \u2013 the book won a Whiting award that year, and in 2017 scooped both the Forward prize and the TS Eliot prize. Vuong, who is 30, was not from a background from which writers traditionally emerge. As a two-year-old, he had been brought to the US from Vietnam as a refugee and settled with his family in the working-class town of Hartford, Connecticut. No one in his family spoke English. When his father left, his mother got work in a nail salon, menial work for little reward and a quality of life that Vuong had no particular expectation of exceeding. If Night Sky tackled the absent father as myth, then his debut novel, On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous, reckons with the mother and grandmother who raised him and it is the influence of these women \u2013 courageous, difficult, devastated by the ripple effect of the Vietnam war \u2013 that forms the spine of the novel and asks the central question: after trauma, how do we love? We are in Vuong\u2019s open-plan living room in Northampton, Massachusetts, a leafy college town where he teaches creative writing at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Peter, his partner of 10 years, has taken the dog out. Vuong is slight, with a silver earring in one ear and the habit of pushing his tortoiseshell glasses up his nose. He speaks, as he writes, in poetic imagery, what he calls \u201cthe metaphor as autobiography of the gaze\u201d. In the novel, the world seen through a speeding car window \u201csurges by like sidewise gravity\u201d. A bird on a windowsill appears not as a bucolic symbol but \u201ca charred pear\u201d. To Little Dog, the protagonist \u2013 so named by his family to protect him beneath a cloak of worthlessness \u2013 the world is an ugly place, in which beauty is made more so for the improbability of existing at all. \u201cFreedom,\u201d he says, \u201cis nothing but the distance between the hunter and its prey.\u201d That On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous is one of the most anticipated novels of the year \u2013 the novelist Max Porter has called it \u201cstaggeringly beautiful\u201d, observing that \u201cit seems obvious now that a gay young poet born in Saigon would write the great American novel\u201d \u2013 is, in large part, down to its perfect engineering, a piece of autobiographical fiction that avoids all the traps of that genre. It is fluid, moving the way thought moves, in circles not lines, and written in the form of a letter to Little Dog\u2019s mother that he knows she\u2019ll never read. It is easy to imagine a bad version of this novel in which any one of its preoccupations might have overgrown to capsize it. It might have been the Opioid Novel, or the Vietnam Novel, or the Exploitative World of the Nail Salon novel. It might have been the Gay Adolescent Love novel or the Violent Childhood novel, all themes that are touched upon lightly while still assuming a fully weighted presence in the narrative. How Vuong does this is a mystery, as is the seamlessness with which he moves between scenes of violence in the Vietnam war to scenes of violence in the home in Connecticut, to love scenes with a doomed boy called Trevor. The book has a poetic density that is at once elliptical and unflinching in its gaze, a testimony to the endlessly complicated dynamics of damage. \u201cSometimes being offered tenderness,\u201d writes Vuong, \u201cfeels like the very proof that you\u2019ve been ruined.\u201d Vuong grew up in a world in which he was marginalised across every axis \u2013 class, race, sexuality. His was a violent household. In a memoir piece he wrote for the New Yorker two years ago, which would form the basis of many scenes in the novel, Vuong, addressing his mother, recalled \u201cthe time you hit me with the remote control. A bruise I would lie about to my teachers. I fell playing tag.\u201d And,\u201cthe time you threw the box of Legos at my head. The hardwood dotted with blood.\u201d And, \u201cthe time with a gallon of milk. A shattering on the side of my head, then the steady white rain on the kitchen tiles.\u201d Post-traumatic stress disorder was something no one had any idea about at the time, \u201cexcept in veterans\u201d. But there is no question, looking back, that both his grandmother, who saw her village in Vietnam razed by US soldiers, and his mother, ripped from everything familiar for a new life in the US, where her husband beat her before leaving, were suffering from PTSD. Violence was the ugly expression of this trauma, but with distance, Vuong could see a positive release of that energy, too \u2013 chiefly in the way that his mother and grandmother told stories. \u201cI didn\u2019t know this until I talked to other Vietnamese-Americans \u2013 that it was rare for families to talk about the war,\u201d he says. Partly it came out of boredom. They were broke, stuck in the house with each other and \u201cwe had no TV\u201d. But there was something else going on, too. \u201cThe stories, at first, were folklore. My grandmother would tell a ghost story, then she would say: oh, that was after the napalm. So through cycles of these stories, that world started opening and as a child I would ask: what\u2019s napalm? They ploughed on. It was almost intoxicating for them to create a mythology of their lives, because they were so powerless. They were all women. The men were gone; they did their harm and were gone. And they were empty hands, had no English, were powerless everywhere else. But when it was time to tell the story, they held everything.\u201d Vuong had no context for what he was hearing. He only knew that in the stories, these women who counted for nothing outside, ran through the fire and survived. \u201cThey turned themselves into myths and it had a rhetorical power. They turned themselves into the Odyssey.\u201d In the novel, the trauma of Little Dog\u2019s mother and grandmother shines through in grimly humorous ways. Lan, the grandmother, yelling at his addled mother to get back in the car, shouts to get through to her, \u201cget back in the helicopter\u201d. Buying a dress from the Salvation Army, his mother asks Little Dog to read the label and find out, \u201cis it fireproof?\u201d In the family mythology, Vuong was the single last hope of these indestructible women and when, in the mid-2000s, Hartford was hit by the opioid epidemic, it\u2019s the thing that stopped him from leaning towards drugs. \u201cA lot of my friends were dying. And I thought: OK, I can die.\u201d Worn out by poverty, bullying, bereavement and violence, he regarded this outcome as regrettable, but \u201cI think that might not have been enough, were it not for me being my family \u2019s only hope. Because they were also dying, in a different way: financially, mentally. And I thought, I can\u2019t die. Literally I can\u2019t die.\u201d He wanted to change his family\u2019s story. He wanted to make his mother happy. He wanted to exceed the expectations of someone born to his station in life. So what did he do? He smiles. \u201cI went to business school.\u201d There was a year in early adulthood when Vuong and his mother didn\u2019t speak. He knew life had been hard for her, leaving Vietnam and dealing with his father, about whom he knows very little other than that after his mother kicked him out, he \u201cwent off to do criminal things and ended up going to jail\u201d. But he hadn\u2019t yet got to the stage of forgiving her. \u201cIt was the worst, for both of us,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd when we looked at each other again, we just sobbed and said: oh, we can\u2019t do that. We\u2019ve got to find a way.\u201d This happened before Vuong had written a single line, and it was important; \u201ca pivotal moment to understand that anger destroys, not only those around you, but especially yourself. Anger is energy \u2013 you can get a lot done with anger; you can write multiple books. We\u2019ve read those books and you realise as you\u2019re reading them: oh, this is not for me. It\u2019s their own project. So I didn\u2019t want to write angry. I didn\u2019t want to be angry. I saw what anger did, growing up, and it was powerful, a force to be reckoned with, but it didn\u2019t lead to anywhere that I was interested in going.\u201d This isn\u2019t the received wisdom among many of those applying to study creative writing at college, where it is sometimes assumed that having something to rage about is a definite advantage. After eight weeks at business school \u2013 which he characterises as \u201clearning to lie\u201d \u2013 Vuong dropped out and enrolled to read literature at Brooklyn College. He started to write poetry. And then he had an unsettling experience. Freshly arrived in New York, he turned up at a poetry reading one night, pretty sure he was about to \u201cmeet my people\u201d, having spent the previous two decades as a fish out of water. \u201cAnd the first thing someone said to me was: hey, I\u2019m at Sarah Lawrence, where are you studying? And I said: oh, I\u2019m not in an MFA [master of fine arts]. And he just turned around and walked off.\u201d He bursts out laughing. \u201cIt was amazing.\u201d Another student on a prestigious writing programme chatted to Vuong for a few moments, before saying: \u201cYou\u2019re so lucky \u2013 you\u2019re gay and from war.\u201d The idea of Vuong\u2019s childhood as a generator of great material for fiction is one that makes him laugh like a drain. These days, if any of his upper-middle-class students grouse that they don\u2019t have a good backstory, he mildly points out that Virginia Woolf got one of the best novels ever written out of someone basically crossing a lawn. At the time, however, he was shocked and disappointed. He hadn\u2019t been prepared for the merciless competition of the New York poetry crowd \u201cwhich depended on appearances, soirees and parties. So I just holed up in my apartment and the library.\u201d His confidence cratered. He wondered if he\u2019d made a terrible mistake. Then he hit upon an unexpected remedy. \u201cA huge moment in my education as a writer was reading biographies. I beg my students to do it, because everything that they\u2019re feeling, Sylvia Plath felt 70 years ago. And Ginsburg and Lorca and Rimbaud. There\u2019s Virginia Woolf, this genius, who\u2019s going on a crisis walk. You read the prose and you would never think this woman has any doubt. And yet here she is, out there, asking: what am I doing?\u201d Vuong thinks he was lucky in some ways. \u201cI had no pressure. I could really experiment with my voice. I could play, and find pleasure in it. I see with my students that they\u2019re under a lot of pressure from their families. A parent will say to me: \u201cmy future Pulitzer winner!\u201d and I just groan. Poor kid. What do you say to that?\u201d He started going to open mic poetry events, which were shabbier and more democratic than formal readings, and at one of which he met a law student called Peter. To that point, Vuong\u2019s relationships had been largely dysfunctional, \u201cbad, bad relationships in almost this cliched trope of seeing what\u2019s familiar in violent, self-destructive folks\u201d. His horizons had been limited in other ways, too. It is an odd side-effect of poverty that you become trapped in a previous era, he says; new things take longer to arrive, and when they do, no one has time to absorb them. \u201cYou don\u2019t have no time. That\u2019s the thing everybody in my community says: I ain\u2019t got no time for that!\u201d He laughs. \u201cBeing poor is about waiting, I learned. You\u2019re waiting in line for welfare. You go to the ER, you wait. You want to file for sexual assault? You wait. And so everybody\u2019s in a queue and one thing that happens is that you\u2019re in a cultural time warp. You\u2019re in the past. So when I went to New York in 2007, I had no iPhone, no Facebook; in my community, when it comes to technology and access, they are mostly in the late 90s.\u201d They were also culturally fairly regressive, although in his own home at least, homophobia was one of Vuong\u2019s lesser problems. (There is a heartbreaking bit in the novel in which Little Dog wakes to find \u201cFAG4LIFE\u201d scrawled on his family\u2019s front door in red paint and he tells his mum that it reads: \u201cMerry Christmas, Ma. See? That\u2019s why it\u2019s red. For luck.\u201d) When he was growing up, his mother and grandmother weren\u2019t thrilled by his sexuality, but \u201cbecause they came from a long line of rice farmers, they were close to native traditions in Vietnam, and those communities had intersex folks who were seen as having all-seeing power. They were powerful people and there was a mysticism associated with that. That doesn\u2019t mean they hoped their children would be queer. But although they were shocked, they had a very practical way of looking at things. That\u2019s what I admired about them. Their view is that this is borrowed time. We should\u2019ve been gone up in smoke. But now we\u2019re here, let\u2019s just live.\u201d The downside to this attitude was economic ruin. \u201cIt leads to financial woes and bankruptcy. Maxed-out credit cards.\u201d He\u2019s laughing now. \u201cOK, after 20 years, the party\u2019s over! Let\u2019s think about savings! They\u2019re all in financial ruts because they had that mentality.\u201d It was a joyfulness, or at least a somewhat constructive outlook, that Vuong associates with women who emerge from trauma as opposed to destructive and self-destructing men. It still amazes him, looking back, how the women in his family \u2013 his mother, his grandmother, his aunts \u2013 dealt with the threat of their husbands. \u201cThe incredible thing that I can never quite understand was how they were able to kick them all out. The men had access to jobs, money, a patriarchal presence in the world, and even though they had troubles too, as immigrants and refugees, we come from a patriarchal tradition in the old country just as deeply rooted as in the west. In some cases, when men are talking to each other, women aren\u2019t supposed to even be in the room. So that was what they were coming out of. And to think divorce?! These things were still taboo where they came from. And they all really did it.\u201d The question of courage underlines everything Vuong writes, both in terms of the characters and in the nerve held by the writer creating them. Night Sky With Exit Wounds, published when he was 27, and which \u201ctook off in ways that no poet ever suspects will happen, and should not expect again\u201d, dared to imagine scenes in which brutality and sensuality combined. (In one scene, the poet describes his father masturbating in a bathroom after he has beaten his mother, observing \u201cthat a man in climax is the closest thing to surrender\u201d.) The novel has a similarly shocking breadth of sympathies. In both, Vuong\u2019s ultimate aim was to dignify the experiences of his childhood with the solemn, years-long gaze of the novelist. \u201cThe great male writers of the European tradition, be it Proust, Tolstoy, Turgenev, deemed that those most inspiring to them existed in a white aristocracy,\u201d he says. \u201cYou read those books and you wouldn\u2019t even know that people of colour existed in Europe. To each his own, and that was their choice. But I wanted to say: these lives, of women, and even of poor white people \u2013 these lives are worthy of literature. As Turgenev looked at the crumbling Russian empire, I look at these folks in a different crumbling empire and deemed that these are inspiring lives to an artist.\u201d He also wanted to say something about where the cost of war falls, not from the vantage point of the grand historical epic, but from inside the small, cramped sadness of a house still flattened decades after the conflict has ended. \u201cIt\u2019s the stories of our species that men create these wars and women clean them up. They clean them up emotionally, they have to deal with the PTSD that comes home, they have to postpone their own healing, forgo their own self-care, in order to hold these households together. They literally nurse these broken bodies back to health. I wanted a book to honour that without romanticising it. To say women have been doing this and they\u2019re not necessarily these heroic legends. What\u2019s the mental cost of the women who do these extraordinary things? In the book, the cost is their own private life.\u201d A few months ago, Vuong\u2019s mother was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and he has been commuting back and forth to Hartford to accompany her to chemotherapy. After a dire admission to hospital, during which, he says, she was in so much pain \u201cit sounded like warfare and I was ready to bury her\u201d, she is responding to treatment and even hopes to come to his book launch. He thinks of something she said to him when he first left for New York. \u201cShe told me: it\u2019s OK for people to think you\u2019re a fool.\u201d Vuong laughed and said: \u201cReally? Why?\u201d and his mother replied: \u201cBecause then they\u2019ll tell you everything about them. You can see them from all their angles.\u201d It\u2019s the wisdom of his life. The subversive power of being \u201ca small, queer, person of colour\u201d is that Vuong has the ability to see everything.

      "body": "<p>A few weeks ago, a backbench Tory MP, convinced that Theresa May\u2019s time was up, had a meeting with Boris Johnson. The MP was honest with the former foreign secretary during their 30-minute chat. \u201cI said to him: \u2018I\u2019m not going to commit to anyone yet. I have rubbished you and trashed you in emails to constituents. I\u2019ve been quite rude about you in interviews about the way you behaved in Brexit votes.\u2019 I said to him: \u2018One problem is you\u2019re a receptacle for every wack job and loon in the Tory party.\u2019 He took it quite well.\u201d</p> <p>The meeting was revealing, not so much for what Johnson said in an attempt to win over the MP, but for the fact that he had found time to have a lengthy meeting with a sceptical colleague. Despite it all, the MP conceded to Johnson that he now faced a dilemma: \u201cI find myself sitting here thinking I might very well vote for you.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s previous tilt at the top job in 2016, brought to a disastrous end by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/jun/30/brexit-live-theresa-may-and-boris-johnson-set-to-announce-leadership-bids\" title=\"\">Michael Gove\u2019s decision to run against him</a>, was marked by chaos and calamity. Even the decision to pull out, he now concedes to allies, was an error. Johnson is understood to have apologised since to supporters who begged him not to throw in the towel.</p> <p>His time as foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jul/09/few-at-foreign-office-will-mourn-boris-johnsons-departure\" title=\"\">was punctuated by gaffes</a> and saw him largely written off as a future prime minister. Yet Johnson has not only managed to re-emerge as the frontrunner to replace May: he has done what some thought impossible, conducting a disciplined, strategic and (so far) relatively error-free campaign that has seen him build more support among MPs than any other candidate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1fe702ac4333aba5e23a475d3070382ea94446c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1fe702ac4333aba5e23a475d3070382ea94446c9/262_0_2298_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In a still from his recent campaign video, Johnson is seen with a woman who admits she is not a Tory voter..\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In a still from his recent campaign video, Johnson is seen with a woman who admits she is not a Tory voter...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So what has changed? In interviews with the <em>Observer</em>, several people who have been close to Johnson since 2016 and MPs who have observed his latest bid for No 10 described a campaign that had been long in the planning, with a larger and more cohesive team and a candidate willing to follow orders and put in the hours. Several said there was a sense from Johnson that he knew he was fortunate to have another chance. \u201cBoris is a figure who defies political rules \u2013 and the fact he has another chance is just another example of that,\u201d said one.</p> <p>Johnson still has key lieutenants from his 2016 leadership bid, notably MPs Jake Berry and Nigel Adams, who remain close at hand. He also speaks to Lynton Crosby, the political strategist who masterminded his London mayoral wins, every day \u2013 but as a friend, rather than formal adviser.</p> <p>Yet it is the new arrivals since 2016 that appear to have helped steady the ship. In a race that is all about winning support from Tory MPs, parliamentary expertise has been drafted in. James Wharton, a former MP popular among colleagues, was recommended as a figure who could boost Johnson\u2019s once dismal reputation among his fellow Tories. Gavin Williamson\u2019s sacking as defence secretary by May also meant there was a former chief whip on the market. Johnson\u2019s special adviser Lee Cain has been charged with the unenviable task of limiting his boss\u2019s newsworthy outbursts and has recently been given reinforcements.</p> <p>The next element was understanding how Johnson could go about changing the minds of enough colleagues to secure a place in the run-off between two contenders, who will face a vote of Conservative members in July. Here, they had a stroke of luck. After finding himself on the backbenches under May, Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, found the time to read the multi-volume biography of former US president Lyndon Johnson by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/21/robert-caro-interview-working-lbj-more-facts-you-collect-closer-to-the-truth\" title=\"\">Robert Caro</a>. Apart from gaining a detailed knowledge of Texan hill farming, it gave Shapps an interest in Johnson\u2019s first rule of politics \u2013 you have to be able to count. From the backbenches, Shapps decided to test his skills \u2013 building a spreadsheet of MPs and attempting to predict how each would vote in the no-confidence motions and meaningful Brexit votes. His results were close to the mark.</p> <p>He then used the same system to map the leadership election, looking at how the electorate of 313 Tory MPs would break down. It led to the creation of \u201cthe spreadsheet\u201d \u2013 a detailed account of where MPs stand and how winnable they are. Persuaded that the Johnson campaign was serious, Shapps joined the crew and his data has been used to put MPs in different groups, with \u201cpivot tables\u201d used to show what kind of campaigning each should be subjected to \u2013 and which are a lost cause.</p> <p>It has helped the team direct their efforts \u2013 and seen Johnson complete as many as 16 appointments with colleagues a day. Breakfasts. Coffees. Lunches. On Monday night, his team had even moved on to assembling a dinner that included some MPs who were already publicly backing another candidate. Few have been safe from the Johnson charm offensive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c899e42835fc63aad97d7979784f20fd0d2ae640\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c899e42835fc63aad97d7979784f20fd0d2ae640/160_0_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Johnson campaign video\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">...whom he canvasses for support...</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @BorisJohnson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One MP who backed Johnson early on said: \u201cI said to Boris, \u2018I really like you.

      "bodyText": "A few weeks ago, a backbench Tory MP, convinced that Theresa May\u2019s time was up, had a meeting with Boris Johnson. The MP was honest with the former foreign secretary during their 30-minute chat. \u201cI said to him: \u2018I\u2019m not going to commit to anyone yet. I have rubbished you and trashed you in emails to constituents. I\u2019ve been quite rude about you in interviews about the way you behaved in Brexit votes.\u2019 I said to him: \u2018One problem is you\u2019re a receptacle for every wack job and loon in the Tory party.\u2019 He took it quite well.\u201d The meeting was revealing, not so much for what Johnson said in an attempt to win over the MP, but for the fact that he had found time to have a lengthy meeting with a sceptical colleague. Despite it all, the MP conceded to Johnson that he now faced a dilemma: \u201cI find myself sitting here thinking I might very well vote for you.\u201d Johnson\u2019s previous tilt at the top job in 2016, brought to a disastrous end by Michael Gove\u2019s decision to run against him, was marked by chaos and calamity. Even the decision to pull out, he now concedes to allies, was an error. Johnson is understood to have apologised since to supporters who begged him not to throw in the towel. His time as foreign secretary was punctuated by gaffes and saw him largely written off as a future prime minister. Yet Johnson has not only managed to re-emerge as the frontrunner to replace May: he has done what some thought impossible, conducting a disciplined, strategic and (so far) relatively error-free campaign that has seen him build more support among MPs than any other candidate. So what has changed? In interviews with the Observer, several people who have been close to Johnson since 2016 and MPs who have observed his latest bid for No 10 described a campaign that had been long in the planning, with a larger and more cohesive team and a candidate willing to follow orders and put in the hours. Several said there was a sense from Johnson that he knew he was fortunate to have another chance. \u201cBoris is a figure who defies political rules \u2013 and the fact he has another chance is just another example of that,\u201d said one. Johnson still has key lieutenants from his 2016 leadership bid, notably MPs Jake Berry and Nigel Adams, who remain close at hand. He also speaks to Lynton Crosby, the political strategist who masterminded his London mayoral wins, every day \u2013 but as a friend, rather than formal adviser. Yet it is the new arrivals since 2016 that appear to have helped steady the ship. In a race that is all about winning support from Tory MPs, parliamentary expertise has been drafted in. James Wharton, a former MP popular among colleagues, was recommended as a figure who could boost Johnson\u2019s once dismal reputation among his fellow Tories. Gavin Williamson\u2019s sacking as defence secretary by May also meant there was a former chief whip on the market. Johnson\u2019s special adviser Lee Cain has been charged with the unenviable task of limiting his boss\u2019s newsworthy outbursts and has recently been given reinforcements. The next element was understanding how Johnson could go about changing the minds of enough colleagues to secure a place in the run-off between two contenders, who will face a vote of Conservative members in July. Here, they had a stroke of luck. After finding himself on the backbenches under May, Grant Shapps, the former party chairman, found the time to read the multi-volume biography of former US president Lyndon Johnson by Robert Caro. Apart from gaining a detailed knowledge of Texan hill farming, it gave Shapps an interest in Johnson\u2019s first rule of politics \u2013 you have to be able to count. From the backbenches, Shapps decided to test his skills \u2013 building a spreadsheet of MPs and attempting to predict how each would vote in the no-confidence motions and meaningful Brexit votes.

Persuaded that the Johnson campaign was serious, Shapps joined the crew and his data has been used to put MPs in different groups, with \u201cpivot tables\u201d used to show what kind of campaigning each should be subjected to \u2013 and which are a lost cause. It has helped the team direct their efforts \u2013 and seen Johnson complete as many as 16 appointments with colleagues a day. Breakfasts. Coffees. Lunches. On Monday night, his team had even moved on to assembling a dinner that included some MPs who were already publicly backing another candidate. Few have been safe from the Johnson charm offensive. One MP who backed Johnson early on said: \u201cI said to Boris, \u2018I really like you.

In the early 1960s Diane Ladd and her then husband, Bruce Dern, suffered an excruciating loss when their 18-month-old daughter drowned.

It is not a spoiler to say that the movie ends with an unflinching scene of death by lethal injection. A woman in the audience had turned to a friend and joked about needing a Valium to get through it.</p> <p>Long before they met in person, Dern (who plays activist Elizabeth Gilbert), had taken to writing long, intimate letters to Jack O\u2019Connell (who plays Willingham) as a way to draw closer to Gilbert\u2019s experience. \u201cI reached out and said, \u2018May we correspond by letter?\u2019 and we did that very intimately, very deeply \u2013 we shared personal history and secrets.\u201d For Dern, Gilbert\u2019s letters were \u201cempathy in action\u201d. \u201cAnyone can make a small gesture of kindness to another person that can effect change in the world, it\u2019s that simple,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"065aea4ac765b71ae153a349eb2e962ff9d5e4c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/065aea4ac765b71ae153a349eb2e962ff9d5e4c1/40_0_1725_1035/1000.jpg\" alt=\"On the line: with Jack O\u2019Connell in Trial by Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the line: with Jack O\u2019Connell in Trial by Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roadside Attractions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Empathy is a favourite word of Dern\u2019s \u2013 shorthand for the kind of communion she works to find with her characters, however compromised they may seem.

There is always a key. To prepare for Renata Klein, the clench-jawed control freak she plays on the runaway hit TV series, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/dec/13/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2017-no-5-big-little-lies\" title=\"\">Big Little Lies</a></em>, Dern interviewed female leaders in tech to help figure out her character\u2019s motivation. In 2018, she won a Golden Globe for her efforts, one of four the series took home that year. \u201cRenata is fierce and complicated and a nightmare, and also just wants a girlfriend and deserves to be seen because she\u2019s lived in a man\u2019s world her whole life,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd what it takes for a woman in tech, a woman in banking, a woman in publishing \u2013 who you have to be and what you have to walk through to get the one seat in that boardroom of 13\u2026\u201d</p> <p>As on the show, the misogyny isn\u2019t exclusive to men. One CEO of a major Silicon Valley startup confided in Dern how crushed she felt after a mother sent her a photo of her son playing soccer with a note that read, \u201cHere\u2019s a picture of your kid, I know you\u2019re too busy to come to the games usually.\u201d Dern throws her hands up in a gesture of exasperation. \u201cShe said, \u2018I am a mom trying to show up and the people that shame me about being a working mother are the other moms.\u2019\u201d Dern would hear the same story in different variations over and again. <em>Big Little Lies</em> is about what men do to women, but it\u2019s also about what women do to each other, and to themselves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8176fdd3282559b7c558b20ae7608b157b670f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8176fdd3282559b7c558b20ae7608b157b670f1/0_689_4480_5737/781.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage\u2019: Laura Dern wears trousers by Sandro; sweater by Sally La Pointe; shoes by Louboutin; and jewellery by Jennifer Fisher.\" width=\"781\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage\u2019: Laura Dern wears trousers by Sandro; sweater by Sally La Pointe; shoes by Louboutin; and jewellery by Jennifer Fisher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ramona Rosales/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Season one of <em>Big Little Lies</em> was framed by a mystery: someone was a victim and someone was a culprit.

Like so many, and not just in Hollywood, she has found herself re-evaluating behaviour and structures she once took for granted. \u201cHere we were \u2013 particularly Reese [Witherspoon], Nicole [Kidman], and myself, working alongside each other since we were basically kids \u2013 but they isolated us,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were never with another [female] actor on set, the crew was all male, so we never said, \u2018Hey, have you ever gone to a hotel to have an audition and nobody else is there, and you feel so terrified and uncomfortable?\u2019\u201d Of her years of auditions, Dern estimates that 75% were in hotel rooms. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a little couch and then a bed, and so you\u2019d be asked to sit next to the director on the bed and read the scene that\u2019s kind of a romantic scene, and you\u2019re still a child?\u201d</p> <p>Dern was six when she decided she wanted to be an actor. It was 1973 and she had spent the school holiday shuttling back and forth between film sets. \u201cMy dad [Bruce Dern] was shooting <em>Family Plot</em> with Hitchcock, and my mom was shooting <em>Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore</em> with Scorsese and, believe it or not, at the end of that summer I was, like, \u2018I think I want to be an actress.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Ladd, who launched her career as a chorus girl at New York\u2019s Copacabana, the prospect of her daughter joining the family trade was a dismal one. \u201cI did not want my daughter to be an actress, but she outsmarted me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh mother, if I could play the piano, would you tie my hands behind my back and tell me I had to wait until I was 21 to play?\u2019\u201d At the age of 17, Dern sued for emancipation, a kind of legal divorce that allows children to make decisions without parental approval. She says it was not personal, but professional. Ladd allowed her to leave home on the condition she live with <a href=\"https://marianne.com/about/\" title=\"\">Marianne Williamson</a>, a writer of self-help books now vying for the Democratic nomination for president.</p> <p>Although she always knew what kind of career she wanted, the template was changing by the time Dern was breaking out. \u201cI was exposed to a real equality in the kind of characters that men and women played in storytelling,\u201d Dern remembers. \u201cBut once I started auditioning, 10 years later, the roles weren\u2019t the same. Something shifted and we were back to the Madonna-or-whore in a movie.\u201d</p> <p>She remembers a prescient encounter at school, when she was 14, shortly after wrapping <em>Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains</em>, about a girl punk band. \u201cA boy was sitting with me and my best friend, and he was a year older than us, and he said, \u2018I know the kind of girl you are.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018The kind of girl I am?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, you know, there\u2019s two kinds of girls: the kind you sleep with and the kind you want to marry.\u2019\u201d Dern, he said, was the kind of girl a guy married; her friend was the kind a guy just slept with. \u201cWe were both equally crushed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like someone branded us.\u201d Dern internalised the boy\u2019s comment. \u201cI was left feeling like if I didn\u2019t lead with sexuality I wasn\u2019t enough, that if I didn\u2019t prove to a boy that I could be all things, I\u2019d failed,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd yet I won the prize because I got picked for a long time; my friend felt hot, but a throwaway.\u201d</p> <p>It was David Lynch, says Dern, who showed her that she could be all things equally. He cast her first in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/17/artsfeatures.davidlynch\" title=\"\">Blue Velvet</a></em> and then some years later in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,544593,00.html\" title=\"\">Wild at Heart</a></em>, his twisted road movie about two lovers on the run. \u201c<em>Wild at Heart</em> is so interesting because I\u2019m all of it,\u201d says Dern. \u201cI\u2019m the girl he picks, and she\u2019s sexual and wild, and it\u2019s all about mess and insanity, but it\u2019s a gift when you can be all of it.\u201d</p> <p>Lately, Dern has found herself playing a multitude of mothers. It has come at just the moment when she finds her own children \u2013 Ellery, her 17-year-old son, and Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, both from her former marriage to the musician Ben Harper (the couple divorced in 2012) \u2013 taking tentative steps towards their adult lives. Last September Ellery walked the runway for Calvin Klein. \u201cSuddenly my son is 17, and I\u2019m realising he may not always live in my house with me, and that has been rather devastating.\u201d The actor smiles glumly. \u201cAs a parent, I felt and thought that, forever, my life would look and feel just like this.\u201d </p> <p>Meanwhile, Dern\u2019s maternal instinct continues to blossom into a series of powerful onscreen matriarchs. \u201cI love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage, and their ferocity and their loneliness and their vulnerability, because these were all things that when I started acting weren\u2019t necessarily on the page.\u201d</p> <p>She used to think she was fearless, but turning 50 shifted her perspective. Sometimes she thinks that she is only just catching up with her daughter in the way she is learning to think about herself. \u201cThat generation doesn\u2019t believe that anyone has the right to define who they are to them, and that includes their sexuality, their sense of self, how they want to be, quote, \u2018branded\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBoy, we were all raised so differently.\u201d It\u2019s become hackneyed to talk about self-actualisation, but Dern seems to be a living embodiment, a woman who might actually be able to say she\u2019s living her best life and mean it.</p> <p>\u201cWhat comes with this moment in life, for me, is a kind of sense of boldness that I thought I had in my 20s, that I was actually nowhere near,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m ready to be an actor, now I feel I want to tackle anything. Now there\u2019s just a longing to explore more, dive deeper, find things that scare me. And go towards them.\u201d</p> <p><em>Big Little Lies starts on Sky Atlantic at 2am</em><em> tomorrow morning, repeated at 9pm, exclusively on Sky Atlantic &amp; N</em><em>ow TV, courtesy of HBO</em></p> <p><em>Laura Dern\u2019s styling by Mary Inacio from The Wall Group; hair by Paul Norton at <a href=\"http://traceymattingly.com\">traceymattingly.com</a> using IGK; makeup by Jo Strettell at <a href=\"http://traceymattingly.com\">traceymattingly.com</a> using Serucell Skincare</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "To hear her mother tell it, it\u2019s a miracle that Laura Dern exists at all. In the early 1960s Diane Ladd and her then husband, Bruce Dern, suffered an excruciating loss when their 18-month-old daughter drowned. The trauma was not just emotional but physical, and doctors told her that she would be unable have another child. But they were wrong, and the proof was Dern. One confounded doctor travelled to the hospital to witness \u201cthe miracle child\u201d. From her home in Ojai, California, Ladd\u2019s smoky southern voice over the phone ripples gently with emotion as she talks to me about her daughter. The miracle child, now 52, grew up to be a great actor in her own right, sometimes even appearing alongside her mother. In 1991, Princess Diana was so taken by the idea that a real-life mother and daughter could play alternative versions of themselves on screen that she flew them both to London for a royal premiere of their garlanded film, Rambling Rose. Ladd recalls \u201cpouring sweat\u201d as she sat next to the princess. Dern was struck by the ways in which her host connected to her character. \u201cShe was empathy in cellular form.\u201d Dern and I are sitting in the Whitby Hotel, in midtown New York. Dapper waiters float around with three-tiered cake plates.

The hotel is designed in the style of an English country home and Dern would like to know when we might get to talk about her love of London. \u201cWhen I\u2019m there I get to have Monmouth Coffee, the park, and the actor Andrew Garfield,\u201d she says as if these three items were on everyone\u2019s British bucket list. \u201cWhat more do you need?\u201d Why Garfield? \u201cHe\u2019s a great, deep soul.\u201d If Dern\u2019s exuberance is a mask, she wears it very well. \u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018me\u2019 to be a mystery,\u201d she says, and then revises the thought. \u201cWell, maybe I\u2019m a mystery to a few boys in my life, but that\u2019s good, that\u2019s OK.\u201d A night earlier, she had attended a screening of Trial by Fire, based on the real-life story of Cameron Todd Willingham, executed in Texas in 2004 for a crime he very likely did not commit. It is not a spoiler to say that the movie ends with an unflinching scene of death by lethal injection.

Empathy is a favourite word of Dern\u2019s \u2013 shorthand for the kind of communion she works to find with her characters, however compromised they may seem.

Trump\u2019s demonisation of Hollywood and the media have brought us together, she says. \u201cHow do we get the word out about what truth looks like, or what people are doing, or injustice, or what it is to be human and complicated?\u201d The letters with O\u2019Connell were also a kind of key Dern used to unlock her character.

Big Little Lies is about what men do to women, but it\u2019s also about what women do to each other, and to themselves. Season one of Big Little Lies was framed by a mystery: someone was a victim and someone was a culprit. The who was the thread that kept audiences guessing until the finale. What can we expect for an encore? \u201cThey\u2019re allowed to feel everything now, while also being watched,\u201d says Dern. \u201cWhat\u2019s cool is that we are no longer servicing a whodunit plot, so the plot can be entrenched in the volcano of emotion we\u2019re all feeling.\u201d On set, Dern and her co-stars have all forged a camaraderie that is novel after decades of feeling marginalised or excluded by a system that favoured men. Dern sits on the 54-member board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which voted to strip Harvey Weinstein of his membership in 2017. Like so many, and not just in Hollywood, she has found herself re-evaluating behaviour and structures she once took for granted. \u201cHere we were \u2013 particularly Reese [Witherspoon], Nicole [Kidman], and myself, working alongside each other since we were basically kids \u2013 but they isolated us,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were never with another [female] actor on set, the crew was all male, so we never said, \u2018Hey, have you ever gone to a hotel to have an audition and nobody else is there, and you feel so terrified and uncomfortable?\u2019\u201d Of her years of auditions, Dern estimates that 75% were in hotel rooms. \u201cYou know, there\u2019s a little couch and then a bed, and so you\u2019d be asked to sit next to the director on the bed and read the scene that\u2019s kind of a romantic scene, and you\u2019re still a child?\u201d Dern was six when she decided she wanted to be an actor. It was 1973 and she had spent the school holiday shuttling back and forth between film sets. \u201cMy dad [Bruce Dern] was shooting Family Plot with Hitchcock, and my mom was shooting Alice Doesn\u2019t Live Here Anymore with Scorsese and, believe it or not, at the end of that summer I was, like, \u2018I think I want to be an actress.\u2019\u201d For Ladd, who launched her career as a chorus girl at New York\u2019s Copacabana, the prospect of her daughter joining the family trade was a dismal one. \u201cI did not want my daughter to be an actress, but she outsmarted me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe said, \u2018Oh mother, if I could play the piano, would you tie my hands behind my back and tell me I had to wait until I was 21 to play?\u2019\u201d At the age of 17, Dern sued for emancipation, a kind of legal divorce that allows children to make decisions without parental approval. She says it was not personal, but professional. Ladd allowed her to leave home on the condition she live with Marianne Williamson, a writer of self-help books now vying for the Democratic nomination for president. Although she always knew what kind of career she wanted, the template was changing by the time Dern was breaking out. \u201cI was exposed to a real equality in the kind of characters that men and women played in storytelling,\u201d Dern remembers. \u201cBut once I started auditioning, 10 years later, the roles weren\u2019t the same. Something shifted and we were back to the Madonna-or-whore in a movie.\u201d She remembers a prescient encounter at school, when she was 14, shortly after wrapping Ladies and Gentlemen, The Fabulous Stains, about a girl punk band. \u201cA boy was sitting with me and my best friend, and he was a year older than us, and he said, \u2018I know the kind of girl you are.\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018The kind of girl I am?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Yeah, you know, there\u2019s two kinds of girls: the kind you sleep with and the kind you want to marry.\u2019\u201d Dern, he said, was the kind of girl a guy married; her friend was the kind a guy just slept with. \u201cWe were both equally crushed,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like someone branded us.\u201d Dern internalised the boy\u2019s comment. \u201cI was left feeling like if I didn\u2019t lead with sexuality I wasn\u2019t enough, that if I didn\u2019t prove to a boy that I could be all things, I\u2019d failed,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd yet I won the prize because I got picked for a long time; my friend felt hot, but a throwaway.\u201d It was David Lynch, says Dern, who showed her that she could be all things equally. He cast her first in Blue Velvet and then some years later in Wild at Heart, his twisted road movie about two lovers on the run. \u201cWild at Heart is so interesting because I\u2019m all of it,\u201d says Dern. \u201cI\u2019m the girl he picks, and she\u2019s sexual and wild, and it\u2019s all about mess and insanity, but it\u2019s a gift when you can be all of it.\u201d Lately, Dern has found herself playing a multitude of mothers. It has come at just the moment when she finds her own children \u2013 Ellery, her 17-year-old son, and Jaya, her 14-year-old daughter, both from her former marriage to the musician Ben Harper (the couple divorced in 2012) \u2013 taking tentative steps towards their adult lives. Last September Ellery walked the runway for Calvin Klein. \u201cSuddenly my son is 17, and I\u2019m realising he may not always live in my house with me, and that has been rather devastating.\u201d The actor smiles glumly. \u201cAs a parent, I felt and thought that, forever, my life would look and feel just like this.\u201d Meanwhile, Dern\u2019s maternal instinct continues to blossom into a series of powerful onscreen matriarchs. \u201cI love playing characters who lead with their desperation and their rage, and their ferocity and their loneliness and their vulnerability, because these were all things that when I started acting weren\u2019t necessarily on the page.\u201d She used to think she was fearless, but turning 50 shifted her perspective. Sometimes she thinks that she is only just catching up with her daughter in the way she is learning to think about herself. \u201cThat generation doesn\u2019t believe that anyone has the right to define who they are to them, and that includes their sexuality, their sense of self, how they want to be, quote, \u2018branded\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBoy, we were all raised so differently.\u201d It\u2019s become hackneyed to talk about self-actualisation, but Dern seems to be a living embodiment, a woman who might actually be able to say she\u2019s living her best life and mean it. \u201cWhat comes with this moment in life, for me, is a kind of sense of boldness that I thought I had in my 20s, that I was actually nowhere near,\u201d she says. \u201cNow I feel like I\u2019m ready to be an actor, now I feel I want to tackle anything. Now there\u2019s just a longing to explore more, dive deeper, find things that scare me. And go towards them.\u201d Big Little Lies starts on Sky Atlantic at 2am tomorrow morning, repeated at 9pm, exclusively on Sky Atlantic &amp; Now TV, courtesy of HBO Laura Dern\u2019s styling by Mary Inacio from The Wall Group; hair by Paul Norton at traceymattingly.com using IGK; makeup by Jo Strettell at traceymattingly.com using Serucell Skincare",

Boo! After school Dunbar worked in a local mill \u2013 but she also went on to write plays, most famously <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/14/rita-sue-and-bob-too-andrea-dunbar-austerity-council-estate\" title=\"\">Rita, Sue and Bob Too</a></em>, inspired by her own experience and produced at the Royal Court in 1982.</p> <p>Freedom Studios\u2019 drama is several steps away from documentary, being an adaptation by Lisa Holdsworth of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/18/black-teeth-brilliant-smile-adelle-stripe-review\" title=\"\">the novel</a> that Adelle Stripe based on Dunbar\u2019s life. But it is vibrant and unsentimental, a shining example of site-specific work. Stripe\u2019s novel opens in Dunbar\u2019s local, the Beacon, in 1990, where the dramatist is taken ill: she died from a brain tumour at the age of 29. Holdsworth\u2019s play is staged, with an all-female cast, in a pub near the town centre. Outside, buses go to Baildon Moor, where Rita and Sue had their sex sessions with Bob; inside, there is dim light, swabbed-down tables and the sort of dingy comforting fug it is hard to find these days. Emily Spowage is impressive as the adult Dunbar: rackety and sceptical in, judging by the photos of the dramatist, a very authentic white jersey.

By 27, she had three children and was living with her parents. That made her feel a failure, though nowadays it\u2019s quite hard to find a 27-year-old <em>not</em> living with their parents.</p> <p>Dunbar\u2019s children have objected to the play \u2013 and Stripe\u2019s novel \u2013 for concentrating on \u201csalacious\u201d episodes in their mother\u2019s life at the expense of her work. I found it not at all gloatingly lewd and think the stoicism and sharpness of the central character likely to enhance her reputation. Yet it is not hard to sympathise with their life/work point. Dunbar\u2019s life has attracted considerable high-grade attention: not only from Stripe and Holdsworth but in film, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/the-arbor-film-review\" title=\"\">from Clio Barnard</a>.

My toddler doesn\u2019t sit still for long, and how many snacks would I need to pack for that length of journey?

At least a flight is over more quickly,\u201d says Hamston, who runs Mummy\u2019s Gin Fund, an online advice forum and buy-and-sell platform for parents.</p> <p>It is a thought that will draw sympathy from many, and highlights the logistical problem of moving a young family from one destination to the next by rail. Hamston, who lives in Devon, says that for families with older children cross-country train journeys could be a great experience, but for now she is sticking with staycations.</p> <h2>Extra costs</h2> <p>With baggage charges, the cost of getting to and from an airport and inflated food costs along the way, even the most budget of flights can balloon in cost quickly.</p> <p>There may be an expectation that, because of the amount of time it takes to get to your destination, rail, road and ferry would automatically be cheaper.</p> <p>The reality is not so clear-cut \u2013 particularly if you have to travel at peak times within the confines of school holidays.</p> <p>As a general rule the earlier you book \u2013 for most modes of travel \u2013 the cheaper the deal. Rail, ferry and airline companies use dynamic pricing, so shopping around in advance will usually pay off.</p> <p>Being flexible on travel dates will also help. Fridays and weekends are notoriously busy days for rail travel, for example, so passengers will usually pay more compared with midweek tickets. A search conducted recently for a return trip from London to Bordeaux for a family of four at the end of July (travelling midweek) would cost about \u00a3500 by train (Eurostar and TGV) or around \u00a3400 to fly with a low-cost airline, including check-in bags.</p> <p>While the train takes around six and a half hours, the flight is one hour 45 minutes.

      "body": "<p>Last Monday, at Apple\u2019s Worldwide Developers Conference, the company\u2019s head of software engineering, Craig Federighi, announced that it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/jun/04/itunes-is-over-what-this-means-for-you\" title=\"\">terminating iTunes</a>. In one way, the only surprising thing was that Apple had taken so long to reach that decision. It\u2019s been obvious for years that iTunes had become baroquely bloated, a striking anomaly for a company that prides itself on elegant and functional design. So the decision to split the software into three functional units \u2013 dealing with music, podcasts and TV apps \u2013 seemed both logical and long overdue. But for internet users <em>d\u2019un certain \u00e2ge</em> (including this columnist) the announcement triggered reflections on personal and tech history.</p> <p>There\u2019s been music on the internet for a long time. The advent of the compact disc in the early 1980s meant that recorded music went from being analogue to digital. But CD music files were vast \u2013 a single CD came in at about 700MB \u2013 and for most people, the network was slow. So transferring music from one location to another was not a practical proposition. But then, in 1993, researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany came up with a way of shrinking audio files by a factor of 10 or more, so that a three-minute music track could be reduced to 3MB without much perceptible loss in quality. <a href=\"https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/en/ff/amm/mp3history.html\" title=\"\">They called their new standard MP3</a> and in July 1994, released the first MP3 encoder, software that could take in CD tracks and compress them using the MP3 filter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2019/jun/04/itunes-is-over-what-this-means-for-you\">iTunes is over: what this means for you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was a pivotal moment for the music industry, but it took another five years for that penny to drop. In that time, music-loving geeks everywhere had \u201cripped\u201d all of their CDs using MP3 encoders and were storing their music on hard drives. (I remember having to buy a bigger \u2013 and ferociously expensive \u2013 hard drive to house my collection.)</p> <p>And then in 1999, a teenage geek named Shawn Fanning created a neat software system that enabled internet users who had MP3 tracks on their PCs not only to find others with similar assets but also to exchange these tracks with one another. Fanning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/may/31/napster-twenty-years-music-revolution\" title=\"\">called his file-sharing system Napster</a>, released it on the internet and in the process changed the world. By the time the music industry managed to get Napster shut down in 2001, it had acquired upwards of 60 million users and virtually every track that had ever been recorded was available \u2013 free \u2013 on the internet, which had now become, as someone once put it, \u201cthe celestial jukebox in the sky\u201d.</p> <p>The problem was that most of these tracks were copyrighted and so much of what was going on was wholesale piracy.

But this apparently lay beyond the capacity of an industry driven by executives with analogue mindsets and incentivised only to sell physical objects called CDs.</p> <p>Their ineptitude created the kind of vacuum that capitalism abhors. And into it strode an entrepreneur who saw in the music industry\u2019s incompetence the commercial opportunity of a lifetime. His name was Steve Jobs.</p> <p>iTunes was his vehicle for exploiting the opportunity. Based on SoundJam MP, a program that Jobs had acquired in 2000 and treated to an Apple makeover, it was launched early in 2001. From the outset, it was a revelation: nicely designed, functional software that made it easy to upload, organise and play one\u2019s digitised music \u2013 even if one were a complete newbie.

      "bodyText": "The Trump presidency began as reality TV, with a cast of loud-mouthed, dim-witted chancers embroiled in histrionic tiffs. Then, capitalising on Trump\u2019s threats to Kim Jong-un, Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury prospectively upgraded it to a war movie. But the nuclear fulminations were only bluff, and Trump soon began to exchange endearments with the chubby North Korean despot, having been told that he might qualify for the Nobel peace prize. The world didn\u2019t end after all, and the anticlimax has forced Wolff, in this new account of later developments, to think again about the Trump show\u2019s genre. Siege reclassifies the hapless administration as a comic opera, calls the president a clown, and makes his rants and tantrums sound absurd not alarming. To keep us quaking, Wolff gives his gossipy narrative a militarised title: we are asked to imagine Trump holed up in the White House as his enemies, armed with subpoenas, close in. Yet this is not the siege of Mafeking, let alone that of Leningrad. The war of attrition waged by Wolff and his fellow journalists has hardly worn Trump down; he retains the freedom of the air, tweeting out a daily barrage of lies and insults and jetting off to stoke up bigots in midwestern arenas or embarrass foreign heads of state who wince as they welcome him on to their soil. Mostly Siege retells scandalous stories that are pretty familiar, with few fresh disclosures. Despite the indiscreet tattle dribbled into his ear by the disgruntled Steve Bannon, Wolff has no idea what arcane surgical procedure (or impasse in nuptial negotiations?) kept Melania in hospital for a week last summer, let alone how Putin managed to reduce Trump to the status of a brutalised cur during their confidential colloquy in Helsinki. The book does have some sharp insights about Trump\u2019s mental deficiencies. Wolff diagnoses narcissism and megalomania, but adds that Trump, despite his keening self-pity, is too imperceptive about people and incurious about their motives to suffer from paranoia. Others rely on incredulous expletives, not clinical jargon, when characterising him. Sean Hannity, the Fox News demagogue who spends hours on the phone with Trump each day, calls him \u201ctotally fucking crazy\u201d; Nick Ayers, after briefly rehearsing to replace John Kelly as his chief of staff, flees in horror from a man he allegorises as \u201cMr Fucking-totally-out-of-his-mind-crazy\u201d. We knew that Trump was illiterate, and now in a neat symmetry Wolff discloses that he is innumerate as well. \u201cDysfunctional and inept\u201d, he \u201ccan\u2019t walk down steps\u201d, and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to use a phone\u201d. Insecurity assails this hollow man, who even resents the fact that his adolescent son Barron, elasticised by a sudden vertical spurt, is about to overtake him in height. \u201cHow do I stunt his growth?\u201d he often asks as he recoils from the Oedipal beanpole. Such malevolent blabbing reveals that Trump is all id, \u201cunable to control his own running monologue\u201d.

      "body": "<p><strong>All New Heart Breakfast</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.heart.co.uk/radio/heart-breakfast-jamie-theakston-amanda-holden/\" title=\"\">Heart</a>)</p> <p>OK. Deep breath. I\u2019m going to talk about <a href=\"https://www.heart.co.uk/radio/heart-breakfast-jamie-theakston-amanda-holden/\" title=\"\">Heart\u2019s new national breakfast show</a>. This started on Monday, with long-standing Heart London breakfast presenter Jamie Theakston being joined by Amanda Holden (full title: Amanda from <em>Britain\u2019s Got Talent</em> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2019/apr/23/chummy-automation-why-no-one-wants-ant-and-dec-to-voice-the-ms-tills\" title=\"\">M&amp;S talk-at-you tills</a> Holden). The show was pretty much as you might expect. Holden is a natural performer: funny, silly, confiding without actually telling you anything you didn\u2019t already know. I wish she wouldn\u2019t pretend to be stupid (\u201cThe periodic table? What\u2019s that?\u201d), but this might be early, please-like-me nerves. Holden is friendly and thoroughly professional. Ashley Roberts, ex-Pussycat Doll and <em>Strictly</em> almost-winner, is another new hiring, in to give us showbiz news (stuff about <em>Love Island</em>), and there\u2019s also the usual win-a-load-of\u2011cash phone-in competition to keep you listening.</p> <p>The deep breath is not because of any of this, but because Heart\u2019s brand new national breakfast show means I have to talk about the current state of the UK\u2019s commercial radio stations. Wait! Come back! Like many things in this world, the story is interesting and boring at the same time.</p> <p>Here goes with the boring bit. Last October, Ofcom, which is in charge of the UK\u2019s radio (including the BBC), made a change to the rules that govern commercial local radio\u2019s output. Previously, these so-called \u201clocalness guidelines\u201d insisted that any commercial local radio station had to feature at least seven hours of locally made output between 6am and 7pm, and this had to include the breakfast show. After October, such a station only had to feature three hours of local output, and the breakfast show did not have to be included.</p> <p>Ooooh, thought the three main commercial radio brands \u2013 Global, Bauer and Wireless Group, since you ask \u2013 these new rules mean that we can give the same breakfast show to lots of our local radio stations, making it, effectively, a national radio show. Global has already done this on Capital, with <a href=\"https://www.capitalfm.com/london/radio/shows-presenters/roman-kemp/\" title=\"\">Roman Kemp, Vick Hope and Sonny Jay</a> (who presented Capital\u2019s London breakfast show) going national on 8 April. <a href=\"https://www.smoothradio.com/digital/radio/shows-presenters/breakfast/\" title=\"\">Smooth Breakfast</a> will go national before the end of the year, and there have been rumours that the presenting job was offered to Davina McCall (supposedly she wanted all school holidays off, so that was a no-no). Wireless, which doesn\u2019t own as many commercial local stations in the UK (it has a few in Ireland), has already made its big breakfast show move, by <a href=\"https://virginradio.co.uk/ourpage\" title=\"\">hiring Chris Evans to do Virgin\u2019s breakfast</a>: a success. Bauer, which owns Hits, Kiss and Magic, is slightly behind, mostly because it\u2019s been busy <a href=\"https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/06/merger-inquiry-begins-into-bauers-radio-group-purchases/\" title=\"\">buying up loads of other radio stations</a>. Also, the most likely Bauer breakfast show to go national, Hits Manchester (which replaced Key 103), has not been a massive success, with the new breakfast show team of Gethin Jones, Dave Vitty and Gemma Atkinson being shunted aside after just one year\u2019s broadcasting (though Atkinson will get a drivetime show, with Wes Butters, after her maternity leave).</p> <p>Is any of this important? Well, if you liked the old local breakfast presenters, then, yes, it is. Jamie and Amanda are replacing 21 different breakfast shows, and the trade website Radio Today estimates that around 70 presenters and producers are being moved from that slot. All the other Heart shows are national now, too, except for the drivetime slot (remember that three hours\u2019 local output rule); there are 12 different regional Heart drivetime shows, and some of the old breakfast show presenters are moving there. Many more, of course, will be kicking their heels, and <a href=\"https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/04/global-starts-selling-its-radio-buildings-ahead-of-networking/\" title=\"\">several of Global\u2019s regional buildings are being shuttered</a>.</p> <p>The bigger question is, of course, do listeners want this? Does it matter if a breakfast show comes from London if the news and the traffic and travel is local? Or if, indeed, the whole day\u2019s output comes from the capital, apart from a three-hour drivetime show? I might be part of the London meeja elite, but to lose all this local talent does seem sad, even if Amanda Holden can generate national headlines simply by changing her frock.</p> <h2>Three shows about\u2026 money</h2> <p><a href=\"https://thisisbud.com/futureproof\" title=\"\"><strong>Futureproof</strong></a><br>A new show hosted by <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05tqk1x\" title=\"\">1Xtra\u2019s Jamz Supernova</a>, this podcast aimed at 20- to 30-year-olds comes from Bud, a company that uses data to help banks, customers and financial providers. <em>Futureproof</em> was inspired by a six-month investigation into young UK adults and their money desires and disasters.

Ashley Roberts, ex-Pussycat Doll and Strictly almost-winner, is another new hiring, in to give us showbiz news (stuff about Love Island), and there\u2019s also the usual win-a-load-of\u2011cash phone-in competition to keep you listening. The deep breath is not because of any of this, but because Heart\u2019s brand new national breakfast show means I have to talk about the current state of the UK\u2019s commercial radio stations. Wait! Come back! Like many things in this world, the story is interesting and boring at the same time. Here goes with the boring bit. Last October, Ofcom, which is in charge of the UK\u2019s radio (including the BBC), made a change to the rules that govern commercial local radio\u2019s output. Previously, these so-called \u201clocalness guidelines\u201d insisted that any commercial local radio station had to feature at least seven hours of locally made output between 6am and 7pm, and this had to include the breakfast show. After October, such a station only had to feature three hours of local output, and the breakfast show did not have to be included. Ooooh, thought the three main commercial radio brands \u2013 Global, Bauer and Wireless Group, since you ask \u2013 these new rules mean that we can give the same breakfast show to lots of our local radio stations, making it, effectively, a national radio show. Global has already done this on Capital, with Roman Kemp, Vick Hope and Sonny Jay (who presented Capital\u2019s London breakfast show) going national on 8 April. Smooth Breakfast will go national before the end of the year, and there have been rumours that the presenting job was offered to Davina McCall (supposedly she wanted all school holidays off, so that was a no-no). Wireless, which doesn\u2019t own as many commercial local stations in the UK (it has a few in Ireland), has already made its big breakfast show move, by hiring Chris Evans to do Virgin\u2019s breakfast: a success. Bauer, which owns Hits, Kiss and Magic, is slightly behind, mostly because it\u2019s been busy buying up loads of other radio stations. Also, the most likely Bauer breakfast show to go national, Hits Manchester (which replaced Key 103), has not been a massive success, with the new breakfast show team of Gethin Jones, Dave Vitty and Gemma Atkinson being shunted aside after just one year\u2019s broadcasting (though Atkinson will get a drivetime show, with Wes Butters, after her maternity leave). Is any of this important? Well, if you liked the old local breakfast presenters, then, yes, it is. Jamie and Amanda are replacing 21 different breakfast shows, and the trade website Radio Today estimates that around 70 presenters and producers are being moved from that slot. All the other Heart shows are national now, too, except for the drivetime slot (remember that three hours\u2019 local output rule); there are 12 different regional Heart drivetime shows, and some of the old breakfast show presenters are moving there. Many more, of course, will be kicking their heels, and several of Global\u2019s regional buildings are being shuttered. The bigger question is, of course, do listeners want this? Does it matter if a breakfast show comes from London if the news and the traffic and travel is local? Or if, indeed, the whole day\u2019s output comes from the capital, apart from a three-hour drivetime show? I might be part of the London meeja elite, but to lose all this local talent does seem sad, even if Amanda Holden can generate national headlines simply by changing her frock. Three shows about\u2026 money Futureproof A new show hosted by 1Xtra\u2019s Jamz Supernova, this podcast aimed at 20- to 30-year-olds comes from Bud, a company that uses data to help banks, customers and financial providers. Futureproof was inspired by a six-month investigation into young UK adults and their money desires and disasters. Each week, Jamz talks to an interviewee about subjects such as saving to buy a property, how to beat paycheck panic, and whether social media is ruining your career prospects. Planet Money Planet Money has been going a long time \u2013 there are more than 900 episodes to choose from! \u2013 and knows what it\u2019s doing. It\u2019s always entertaining, whether relating the story of how Japanese people started to eat raw salmon, or how the US unemployment rate got so low, or exactly what Trump\u2019s relationship is with debt. Contributors are lively, with great communication skills (no time is wasted). For the UK listener, it can be a bit American, but you can\u2019t fail to find a story that grabs you. FT Money Show This Financial Times weekly podcast has been running for over six years, so, again, there\u2019s a big back-catalogue. It\u2019s a simple format: host talks to various experts, about ISAs, pensions, credit scores etc. It\u2019s news-based \u2013 this week\u2019s episode discusses fund manager Neil Woodford and YouTube millionaires \u2013 so you can feel on top of what\u2019s going on. Be warned: this podcast\u2019s USP is clarity and calm (again, no surprise), so if you\u2019re looking for fireworks, better try a different show.",

But the reason why Futura were so intrigued was because, while Viagra, Cialis and other drugs have to be taken orally \u2013 meaning they reach the target area via the bloodstream and so interact with other systems in the body \u2013 GTN could be rapidly absorbed into erectile tissue through the skin. This meant that it could potentially be applied directly as part of a gel or cream, with almost instantaneous results and none of the troublesome side effects associated with Viagra.</p> <p>\u201cViagra and Cialis are quite effective drugs but 50% of people stop using them within a year,\u201d says James. \u201c60-70% of people have some degree of dissatisfaction with them. This shows there\u2019s an opportunity if we can come to market with something that addresses many of those concerns.\u201d</p> <p>Over the past decade, Futura have developed a GTN-based gel called Eroxon which appears to be capable of inducing an erection in patients with mild to moderate erectile dysfunction in five to 10 minutes. Already dubbed the new Viagra by some, it seems to have the potential to be the first genuinely novel treatment for erectile dysfunction in two decades, and Futura have even tentatively placed its potential commercial value at $1bn.</p> <p>After investors showed a renewed interest in backing novel treatments for erectile dysfunction, Futura completed a <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1743609517318520\" title=\"\">clinical trial of 232 patients</a> last year, and have now embarked on a final phase III trial of 1,000 patients to be completed by the end of 2019. If this succeeds, Eroxon could become available clinically within the next couple of years, although urologists remain cautious.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest question from that phase III trial will be how they compare in clinical efficacy to Viagra,\u201d says Soni. \u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s difficult to get similar efficacy with topical administration, but at the same time, our understanding of how drugs can be absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream has massively improved.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tackling the most severe cases</strong> </h2> <p>But even Futura\u2019s scientists admit that Eroxon is unlikely to help the severest cases of erectile dysfunction, which affect around 20-30% of patients, typically due to nerve damage in the lower abdomen.</p> <p>In the past there have been few options for these people, but over the past five years, the renewed interest in erectile dysfunction has seen research programmes dedicating more time and money to clinical trials of a technology known as shockwave therapy. Unlike Viagra or Eroxon, this attempts to reverse the problems which cause the dysfunction by passing low-intensity sound waves through erectile tissue.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Desperation has pushed many into\u00a0private clinics that offer shockwaves, stem cell infusions or injections of plasma</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Scientists are still not entirely sure how or why it works, but so far they think it leads to a form of regeneration of the erectile tissue, promoting the growth of new blood vessels and clearing plaque from existing vessels. \u201cImproving the function of these vessels leads to improved blood flow and erections in those patients,\u201d explains Georgios Hatzichristodoulou, who researches shockwave therapy at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany.</p> <p>However, because there is such a wide spectrum of causes of erectile dysfunction, shockwave therapy is currently only known to work in a subset of these patients, particularly those where the damage has resulted from diabetes or hypertension.</p> <p>Hatzichristodoulou points out that there remains a need for further data, with a series of trials of shockwave therapy currently going on in Europe and the US. But compared to Viagra or Eroxon, one of the great promises of the treatment is that it would not be needed on a regular basis. Instead, patients could simply undergo maintenance therapy at half-yearly or annual intervals.</p> <p>Most tantalisingly, in attempting to restore the natural function of the penis, it points towards an eventual cure, a hope which may yet be realised in years to come.</p> <h2><strong>The search for an all-out cure</strong> </h2> <p>Even when Viagra works, one of the problems for people who need to take it indefinitely is that it becomes less effective over the course of months or years.</p> <p>\u201cThis is quite common. Most patients will experience a worsening of their erections after they\u2019ve been on Viagra for a while,\u201d says Hatzichristodoulou. \u201cThey take Viagra for five, six, 10 years, and some days they feel that there is little improvement in function.\u201d</p> <p>Desperation has pushed many patients towards unscrupulous private clinics around the world, who promise an ultimate cure, offering treatments like shockwaves, stem cell infusions and injections of platelet-rich plasma on an unregulated basis. But all of these therapies are highly experimental \u2013 as an example, shockwave therapy is currently only approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to stimulate wound healing, as scientists are still working on establishing the best doses for efficacy and investigating long-term safety.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"87baf94c703bccce4d45ddc0a5cc9d846e112291\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87baf94c703bccce4d45ddc0a5cc9d846e112291/0_0_2712_3881/699.jpg\" alt=\"pel\u00e9 appears in a magazine advert endorsing viagra circa 2000\" width=\"699\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pel\u00e9 appears in a magazine advert endorsing Viagra, circa 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Advertising Archives</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s some particularly compelling data on shockwave therapy, especially in certain patients,\u201d says Soni. \u201cBut it is still in an early phase.\u201d</p> <p>While scientists hope that shockwave therapy may be ready for primetime within the next five to 10 years, progress is also being made on longer-term treatments such as gene therapy which could offer a complete cure. At the <a href=\"https://divisionofresearch.kaiserpermanente.org/\" title=\"\">Kaiser Permanente Division of Research</a> in northern California, a group of scientists have identified a genetic switch which is thought to be unique to sexual function. They believe that this switch plays a crucial role in controlling the brain signals which initiate an erection, and new genome editing technologies such as Crispr-Cas9 could one day allow scientists to reactivate this switch in patients.</p> <p>\u201cThis genetic location is part of a pathway which is involved in a number of different systems in the body, from pigmentation to weight to sexual function,\u201d explains project leader Eric Jorgenson. \u201cBut what is exciting about this, is that it seems to be very specific to sexual function, which would make it possible to target this location and not disturb anything else in the body. But there\u2019s a long way to get there. We need to understand the exact part of the brain where this switch is active, and then try targeting it in mice.\u201d</p> <p>Because genome editing is still such an experimental concept, Jorgenson says it will take time for regulators to become confident that it could be safe. \u201cThe first uses of Crispr-like technology will probably be in patients where there\u2019s more of a direct medical need for experimental therapies,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019d need to have a very safe treatment before people will allow it for erectile dysfunction.\u201d</p> <p>While gene therapy may be a little way off, there are still new treatments on the horizon for erectile dysfunction for the first time in decades.

They heard Green\u2019s threats that Arcadia would be tipped into administration if they voted against the restructuring plan \u2013 formally, a company voluntary arrangement, or CVA \u2013 but decided to take their chances. They\u2019ve secured a better offer that they are free to reject or approve at the rescheduled vote this Wednesday. So, yes, it\u2019s a little victory for the landlords.</p> <p>Take a step back, though, and this CVA still looks a remarkably good piece of business from the Greens\u2019 point of view. Chucking an extra \u00a39.5m in the landlords\u2019 direction is a small price for Green to pay if he gets the deal over the line and thereby secures his bigger prize \u2013 an effective cap on his pension liability.</p> <p>On the pension front, Green\u2019s absolute priority will have been to avoid the humiliating fiasco of BHS, where he was eventually obliged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/feb/28/philip-green-agrees-pay-363m-bhs-pension-fund\" title=\"\">cough up \u00a3363m</a> in 2017, when the department store chain collapsed a year after he sold it to a former bankrupt. In the Arcadia restructuring, therefore, he had to make peace with the Pensions Regulator. And he has done it: after some huffing and puffing, he\u2019s got an agreement whereby the fund gets contributions of \u00a3100m over three years from Lady Tina, three annual payments of \u00a325m (reduced from \u00a350m) from Arcadia itself, plus security over \u00a3210m of assets.</p> <p>That collection adds up to \u00a3385m, but remember two important points. First, the deficit in the Arcadia scheme is much larger \u2013 between \u00a3537m and \u00a3727m, according to different accounting measures, on the most recent public data. Second, CVAs do not have a great record of rescuing businesses: half the companies that use them subsequently fail, and sometimes quickly.</p> <p>So what would happen if Arcadia, perhaps dragged down by tired brands such as Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Wallis, becomes one of the flops?

Lady Green would still be on the hook for any outstanding element of her \u00a3100m contribution; and the pension fund could claim \u00a3210m of security over assets. But it is hard to see how the Pensions Regulator could demand that the Greens fill the rest of the deficit. Why? Well, unlike at BHS, Sir Philip would be able to say: \u201cLook, the regulator approved everything and voted in favour of the CVA.\u201d It would be a strong argument.</p> <p>That, one can guess, is why the Greens are desperate to get the landlords\u2019 approval and secure the CVA. It is also why, even at this late stage, it is welcome that Frank Field MP is putting pressure on the Pensions Regulator to explain its workings. So it should. The Greens were paid a \u00a31.2bn dividend from Arcadia in 2005 and, at any subsequent point, could have chosen to address the pension deficit decisively from their own fortune.

      "body": "<p>Joan Shuttleworth has fond memories of her 1940s childhood in Orchard Park, near Buffalo. \u201cWhen I was seven or eight I used to do the grocery shopping at a small store a block from our house,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt was all paper or cloth bags, and fish and meat would be wrapped in butchers\u2019 paper. There was no plastic.\u201d</p> <p>The lightweight polythene plastic bags we know today were <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/how-the-plastic-bag-became-so-popular/381065/\">patented in Sweden</a> in 1965. By 1979, 80% of European supermarkets were using plastic, and by the early 1980s they were widespread across the US \u2013 aggressively pushed by the oil <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/10/how-the-plastic-bag-became-so-popular/381065/\">company Mobil</a>. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t think about it,\u201d said Shuttleworth, a 79-year-old retired nurse now living in Oakland, California. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise what a scourge they would become. It was mindless.\u201d</p> <p>Today, much of our resource-intensive consumerism is still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/10/marie-kondo-you-know-what-would-spark-joy-buying-less-crap\">mindless</a>, despite rising awareness of the <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2018/06/plastic-planet-animals-wildlife-impact-waste-pollution/\">impact of our plastic waste</a>. Amid the hustle and convenience of a grocery store, it\u2019s hard to connect our own behaviour to the distant problems in the depths of the oceans. But the dozens of perfectly intact plastic bags<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/19/shocking-autopsy-photos-show-toll-of-plastic-waste-on-dead-whale\"> pulled from the stomach</a> of a dead Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale in the Philippines this spring could be from any of us. Those bags were once used in a grocery store \u2013 for an average of <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/more-recycling-wont-solve-plastic-pollution/\">12 minutes</a> \u2013 just to carry that bottle of wine home. A study by the Washington-based <a href=\"http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5565\">Worldwatch Institute</a> estimated that 4-5tn bags, including shopping bags and trash bags, were made in 2002 alone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/mar/14/plastic-microfiber-pollution-clothes-washing-solutions\">#Plasticfree: how to handle the scary plastic threat on our own backs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Countries around the world are stepping up <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2176417-new-zealand-becomes-the-latest-country-to-ban-plastic-bags/\">plastic bag bans</a>. Statewide bans have been introduced in California and Hawaii, as well as 240 cities and counties across the US. Bangladesh banned plastic bags in 2002 when it found they blocked drains and contributed to flooding. China, Israel, South Africa, Rwanda and others have followed suit. Some, including the UK, have implemented charges for bags instead.</p> <p>Plastic bag regulation can have unintended consequences. Sales of small trash can liners increased 120% after bag bans, 2019 research by Rebecca Taylor of the University of Sydney revealed, which resulted in thicker and heavier plastics ending up in landfill. While bans led to a 40.3m-pound reduction in plastic waste, that was offset by 11.5m pounds of waste caused by people using new bags instead of reusing carriers.</p> <p>Look at the carbon emissions of different bags in isolation, and our aversion to plastic bags looks misplaced; they simply use far less energy and water to produce. A paper bag needs to be used three times to equal the emissions of standard single-use polyethylene bags, and a cotton tote needs to be used 131 times, according to <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/291023/scho0711buan-e-e.pdf\">2011 research</a> by the UK government\u2019s Environment Agency. It\u2019s even worse if other environmental factors, such as toxic pollution, resource depletion and water use, are factored in. Research by the <a href=\"https://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2018/02/978-87-93614-73-4.pdf?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20190408&amp;utm_campaign=money&amp;utm_term=nprnews\">Danish government</a> in 2018 found that paper shopping bags need to be used 43 times to offset all environmental factors, and organic cotton totes an astonishing 20,000 times.</p> <p>While that\u2019s horrifying, the study did not deal with far less quantifiable effects of plastic pollution in the oceans and its impact on wildlife. Plastics kill an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and a million seabirds every year, and once the bodies decompose the plastic persists to be eaten by yet more animals.</p> <p>For nearly a year, our family has been on a mission to cut out single-use plastics from our home. I\u2019ve had the same massive, sturdy shopping bags since 2002 when I bought them in the British design store Habitat, and these workhorses have done everything from laundry and camping trips to moving house. When we take them shopping, we now also take small homemade cotton produce bags. When we do end up with Ziploc or food bags (largely from other people) we rinse and reuse until they fall apart.</p> <p>We recycle diligently too, but recent reports about backlogs of US recycling being sent to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/21/philadelphia-covanta-incinerator-recyclables-china-ban-imports\">incinerators</a> have confused me. It sounded like the beginning of the end of viable recycling. So I took myself to San Francisco\u2019s employee-owned <a href=\"https://www.recology.com/\">Recology recycling centre</a>, a leader in waste reduction that has \u2013 in combination with some robust city waste regulations \u2013 helped San Francisco keep 80% of its waste out of landfill.</p> <p>I realised I had been thinking about recycling as a benevolent community service, but that\u2019s wrong. Recycling companies are <em>businesses</em> that take our waste and try to sell it on. Glass, paper, cardboard, metal and plastic are sorted into different streams, and then packed in one-ton bales to sell to manufacturers. Of the seven main types of plastics, plastics numbered 1 and 2, such as detergent bottles, are easy to sell, but the rest are harder. If plastic doesn\u2019t make a sound when you drop it, it\u2019s probably worthless.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s big demand for bales of recycled paper, and Amazon and others need cardboard for their boxes,\u201d Recology\u2019s Robert Reed tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s 80% of the recycling bin. But the challenge for our man here who sells the bales is these low-grade plastics. There\u2019s just no market for them.\u201d Recycling companies also hate plastic bags because they get tangled in their sorting machinery, and can easily get mixed up with paper bales, making them less valuable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jan/15/dog-poop-bags-plastic-alternatives\">Dog poop bags are a menace. But what's the green alternative?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Contamination is a huge issue. Plastic takeout containers can\u2019t be recycled if they contain food \u2013 we should rinse or wipe out our recycling \u2013 and that\u2019s one reason China stopped accepting America\u2019s plastic waste in January 2018. </p> <p>There is a recycling scheme for plastic bags run, rather surprisingly, by the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/clientsum.php?id=D000000365&amp;year=2018\">spends millions</a> protecting the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/19/sunday-review/should-america-bag-the-plastic-bag.html\">interests</a> of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/aug/25/household-chemicals-toxic-substances-control-act-congress-environmental-defense-fund-sustainability\">plastics</a> industry. Their Wrap scheme manages 18,000 bins at grocery stores across the US, collecting clean bags and plastic film from customers and reminding them not to put it in curbside recycling. Half of the collected plastic is shipped overseas, largely to Asia, where the ACC says it doesn\u2019t know what happens to it.

      "bodyText": "Joan Shuttleworth has fond memories of her 1940s childhood in Orchard Park, near Buffalo. \u201cWhen I was seven or eight I used to do the grocery shopping at a small store a block from our house,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt was all paper or cloth bags, and fish and meat would be wrapped in butchers\u2019 paper. There was no plastic.\u201d The lightweight polythene plastic bags we know today were patented in Sweden in 1965. By 1979, 80% of European supermarkets were using plastic, and by the early 1980s they were widespread across the US \u2013 aggressively pushed by the oil company Mobil. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t think about it,\u201d said Shuttleworth, a 79-year-old retired nurse now living in Oakland, California. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise what a scourge they would become. It was mindless.\u201d Today, much of our resource-intensive consumerism is still mindless, despite rising awareness of the impact of our plastic waste. Amid the hustle and convenience of a grocery store, it\u2019s hard to connect our own behaviour to the distant problems in the depths of the oceans. But the dozens of perfectly intact plastic bags pulled from the stomach of a dead Cuvier\u2019s beaked whale in the Philippines this spring could be from any of us. Those bags were once used in a grocery store \u2013 for an average of 12 minutes \u2013 just to carry that bottle of wine home. A study by the Washington-based Worldwatch Institute estimated that 4-5tn bags, including shopping bags and trash bags, were made in 2002 alone. Countries around the world are stepping up plastic bag bans. Statewide bans have been introduced in California and Hawaii, as well as 240 cities and counties across the US. Bangladesh banned plastic bags in 2002 when it found they blocked drains and contributed to flooding. China, Israel, South Africa, Rwanda and others have followed suit. Some, including the UK, have implemented charges for bags instead. Plastic bag regulation can have unintended consequences. Sales of small trash can liners increased 120% after bag bans, 2019 research by Rebecca Taylor of the University of Sydney revealed, which resulted in thicker and heavier plastics ending up in landfill. While bans led to a 40.3m-pound reduction in plastic waste, that was offset by 11.5m pounds of waste caused by people using new bags instead of reusing carriers. Look at the carbon emissions of different bags in isolation, and our aversion to plastic bags looks misplaced; they simply use far less energy and water to produce. A paper bag needs to be used three times to equal the emissions of standard single-use polyethylene bags, and a cotton tote needs to be used 131 times, according to 2011 research by the UK government\u2019s Environment Agency. It\u2019s even worse if other environmental factors, such as toxic pollution, resource depletion and water use, are factored in. Research by the Danish government in 2018 found that paper shopping bags need to be used 43 times to offset all environmental factors, and organic cotton totes an astonishing 20,000 times. While that\u2019s horrifying, the study did not deal with far less quantifiable effects of plastic pollution in the oceans and its impact on wildlife. Plastics kill an estimated 100,000 marine mammals and a million seabirds every year, and once the bodies decompose the plastic persists to be eaten by yet more animals. For nearly a year, our family has been on a mission to cut out single-use plastics from our home. I\u2019ve had the same massive, sturdy shopping bags since 2002 when I bought them in the British design store Habitat, and these workhorses have done everything from laundry and camping trips to moving house. When we take them shopping, we now also take small homemade cotton produce bags. When we do end up with Ziploc or food bags (largely from other people) we rinse and reuse until they fall apart. We recycle diligently too, but recent reports about backlogs of US recycling being sent to incinerators have confused me. It sounded like the beginning of the end of viable recycling. So I took myself to San Francisco\u2019s employee-owned Recology recycling centre, a leader in waste reduction that has \u2013 in combination with some robust city waste regulations \u2013 helped San Francisco keep 80% of its waste out of landfill. I realised I had been thinking about recycling as a benevolent community service, but that\u2019s wrong. Recycling companies are businesses that take our waste and try to sell it on. Glass, paper, cardboard, metal and plastic are sorted into different streams, and then packed in one-ton bales to sell to manufacturers. Of the seven main types of plastics, plastics numbered 1 and 2, such as detergent bottles, are easy to sell, but the rest are harder. If plastic doesn\u2019t make a sound when you drop it, it\u2019s probably worthless. \u201cThere\u2019s big demand for bales of recycled paper, and Amazon and others need cardboard for their boxes,\u201d Recology\u2019s Robert Reed tells me. \u201cThat\u2019s 80% of the recycling bin. But the challenge for our man here who sells the bales is these low-grade plastics. There\u2019s just no market for them.\u201d Recycling companies also hate plastic bags because they get tangled in their sorting machinery, and can easily get mixed up with paper bales, making them less valuable. Contamination is a huge issue. Plastic takeout containers can\u2019t be recycled if they contain food \u2013 we should rinse or wipe out our recycling \u2013 and that\u2019s one reason China stopped accepting America\u2019s plastic waste in January 2018. There is a recycling scheme for plastic bags run, rather surprisingly, by the American Chemistry Council (ACC), which spends millions protecting the interests of the plastics industry. Their Wrap scheme manages 18,000 bins at grocery stores across the US, collecting clean bags and plastic film from customers and reminding them not to put it in curbside recycling. Half of the collected plastic is shipped overseas, largely to Asia, where the ACC says it doesn\u2019t know what happens to it. The other 50% is sent to companies including Trex, which makes decking out of melted plastic films and wood chip \u2013 which, like most composites, is too difficult to recycle. But perfect if you want decking planks that will be around in 1,000 years. Business has profited immeasurably for decades by using cheap plastic packaging, and yet the cost of cleaning up after them has fallen to consumers and local governments. \u201cThese are complicated, wicked problems that require very complicated, multi-actor solutions,\u201d says Christopher Jones, senior lecturer in environmental psychology at the University of Surrey in the UK. \u201cGovernment can introduce legislation and guidelines that can also affect retailers, so you need retailers onboard as well. But there is a degree of responsibility on the consumer \u2026 if you continue to buy cheap goods that are being sourced in an unsustainable way, then they are going to continue to make them.\u201d Jones says consumer behaviour is affected by both environmental factors \u2013 like a plastic bag surcharge \u2013 and by awareness of an issue, which can help someone connect their behaviour to a bigger problem. \u201cMaking people feel proud of their behaviour is a better way of stimulating action,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt comes down to a feeling of empowerment and doing the right thing, and bolsters your identity in a way that makes you more likely to act in a consistent pro-environmental way.\u201d As ever, these environmental concerns only become more complicated the closer we look. But for all the research there is one simple constant: buy less stuff, and reuse what you have.",

      "bodyText": "As we\u2019re now witnessing, Trumpian economic nationalism is a zero-sum game in which the industries of the future are dominated either by China or by the United States. We win or they win. The loudest opposition to this view comes from multinational American corporations and their Republican shills in Congress, who don\u2019t want tariffs stopping them from making bundles of money around the world. So is this the only choice \u2013 zero-sum economic nationalism or unfettered free trade? No. There\u2019s a third alternative: \u201cindustrial policy\u201d \u2013 which means putting national resources (government spending on research and development, along with tax subsidies and export incentives) behind emerging industries, while making sure the nation\u2019s workers get the resulting experience and jobs. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s new Plan for Economic Patriotism, unveiled on Tuesday, marks a stunningly ambitious version of American industrial policy. Industrial policy centers on a social contract between the public and business: corporations get extra resources to grow bigger and more innovative. In return, those corporations create high-paying jobs in the nation, and focus on sectors promising the greatest social returns. This isn\u2019t laissez-faire economics; nor is it zero-sum economic nationalism. America\u2019s investments in its workers and leading-edge industries wouldn\u2019t prevent other nations from making similar investments. Such competition is positive-sum: if all nations\u2019 workers became more productive, and all socially-beneficial industries grew, the world will be better for everyone. Those of us who advocated for an industrial policy decades ago argued that America already had one, but it was hidden. Our giant defense industry had turned America into the world\u2019s leading maker of bombs, airplanes, satellite communications, cargo ships, and container ships, as well as the leader in computers, software and the internet. Our subsidies for pharmaceuticals under the National Institutes of Health (NIH) were central to our dominance over new drugs. But America\u2019s hidden industrial policy didn\u2019t necessarily benefit America. Military spending was bloated and wasteful. The NIH didn\u2019t require drug companies using its research to invest in good jobs in America, or to hold down drug prices. In subsequent years, special tax breaks for oil and gas have hastened the climate crisis. The huge, no-strings-attached 2008 bailout of Wall Street allowed financial executives to prosper even as millions of Americans lost their homes and savings because of Wall Street\u2019s gambling addiction. State and local subsidies to lure companies their way (like the recent bidding war for Amazon\u2019s new headquarters) have merely moved jobs from one place to another, and are ignored when a company decides it can do even better by moving elsewhere. Other countries such as Germany and China have been far smarter and more open about their industrial policies. Smartness and openness go together. An open, explicit industrial policy becomes a national competitive strategy. A hidden industrial policy becomes a haven for political payoffs \u2013 a form of corporate welfare. Which may be why big business in America killed off industrial policy in the 1980s. Such talk threatened to expose how much public money big business was raking in without doing anything in return. Warren berates American companies that \u201chave no loyalty or allegiance\u201d to the nation they were born in. \u201cThese \u2018American\u2019 companies show only one real loyalty: to the short-term interests of their shareholders, a third of whom are foreign investors,\u201d she writes. But Warren is no zero-sum economic nationalist. She understands globalization can be a positive force if focused on improving the conditions of a nation\u2019s workforce rather than on maximizing returns to capital. \u201cGlobalization isn\u2019t some mysterious force whose effects are inevitable and beyond our control. No \u2013 America chose to pursue a trade policy that prioritized the interests of capital over the interests of American workers.\u201d Warren proposes enlarging federal research and development, and targeting it on leading technologies. These R&amp;D investments would be \u201cspread across every region of the country, not focused on only a few coastal cities\u201d. The products that emerge would be built by American workers. Her Green Manufacturing Plan proposes allocating $150bn annually for the next decade to renewable, green, American-made energy products, along with a dramatic expansion of worker training to ensure Americans have the skills for the anticipated new jobs. It\u2019s a national investment in our future. \u201cOver the next decade, the expected market for clean energy technology in emerging economies alone is $23tn,\u201d she explains. It would also be good for the world. She calls for a Green Marshall plan, \u201cdedicated to selling American-made clean, renewable, and emission-free energy technology abroad and a $100bn commitment to assisting countries to purchase and deploy this technology.\u201d As Trump erects tariff walls and rolls back federal efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions, Elizabeth Warren is promoting a positive economic nationalism designed both to advance America\u2019s workers and respond to one of the most profound crises confronting the world. She reasons that if China can commit its national resources to promoting its domestic industry through plans such as Made-in-China 2025, and Germany can undertake economic planning, there\u2019s no reason America can\u2019t plan a future of cutting edge industries and good jobs \u2013 while combating the climate emergency. She\u2019s right.

He had temporarily been put in charge of a prisoner-of-war camp of German tank crews after the <a href=\"https://www.dday-overlord.com/en/battle-of-normandy/cities/calvados/caen\" title=\"\">battle for Caen</a>. The very young men the other side of the barbed wire, he said, looked indistinguishable from his own men. They weren\u2019t Nazis. They were Europeans caught up in the same terrible events as he was, but unlucky to be born in the wrong country. Never, never again. Europeans had been fighting each other too often. Were our arguments and differences so deep that there was no other solution than killing each other on such a scale? It had to stop. The members of the wartime generation, what the US journalist Tom Brokaw called \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d in his book chronicling their experiences, were unique. Nobody escaped the dreadful pall of the 1930s depression and the fear of unemployment. Having lived through the privations of a capitalist system that palpably did not work, they found themselves locked in a world war against fascism. It seemed that the good life would never come their way. For them, it was about belt-tightening, facing any hardship, pulling together and, ultimately, coming through.</p> <p>The searing experience incubated a collective purpose: to build so that it could never happen again. Their legacy \u2013 the mixed economy, the welfare state, European and global institutions designed to promote trade, collaboration, peace and help for developing countries \u2013 has been resilient enough to offer my generation what they did not have.</p> <p>Above all, the D-day celebrations signify a shared purpose now lost. What was so painfully won is being put insouciantly to one side, from crucial values to the tools of economic management, and a society absent of an overriding shared purpose is unable to muster resistance. Contemporary capitalism, left too much to its own devices by the rightwing proposition that the state must keep out of the economy, does not work. The inequalities it has thrown up are, as in the 1930s, provoking powerful societal protests. And, as in the 1930s, a new wave of demagogues, of whom Nigel Farage is a prime example, is blaming an out-of-touch elite for misgoverning a population needy of change.</p> <p>Foreigners must lie at the root of our ills and there is no greater or more intrusive foreign agent than the European Union. Vote Brexit \u2013 it offers a purpose otherwise lacking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26eabea86ba246c32284eb555c0c85cb55444797\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26eabea86ba246c32284eb555c0c85cb55444797/0_54_2287_1371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler in Florence, Italy, 1940.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler in Florence, Italy, 1940.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Incredibly, there are even British rightwing politicians using exactly the same language as Hitler and Mussolini. For both dictators, the popular will, expressed in referendums manipulated to produce the right result, had to override parliaments and democratic assemblies, which must be suspended or prorogued if they oppose it. Yet Tory leader hopeful Dominic Raab, deranged by the religion of Brexit, proposes just such <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/08/suspending-parliament-should-not-be-ruled-out-says-dominic-raab\" title=\"\">a suspension of parliament</a> this autumn to deliver a no-deal Brexit. It is crazed and totalitarian in its spirit, the antithesis of what the millions, including my father, fought for 75 years ago. The feebleness of the reaction \u2013 no such man should ever be entrusted with the prime ministership of Britain or even a position in its government \u2013 betokens how far we have sunk.</p> <p>I can write my columns for as long as you are willing to read them, but words do not have the same impact as lived experience. The wartime generation were so shaped by what they lived through that they created the institutions that have served us so well. Maybe the British will have to live through a suspended parliament and the mayhem of a no-deal Brexit to learn that the ultra-populist right, with all its hatred of the other and of international collaboration, offers no worthwhile answer.</p> <p>Rather, our purpose lies in rebuilding the values and institutions bequeathed to us by that wartime generation. If the D-day celebrations made any contribution to promoting again a collective way of thinking, they will have been worth their weight in gold.</p> <p>\u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist</p>",

Were our arguments and differences so deep that there was no other solution than killing each other on such a scale? It had to stop. The members of the wartime generation, what the US journalist Tom Brokaw called \u201cthe Greatest Generation\u201d in his book chronicling their experiences, were unique. Nobody escaped the dreadful pall of the 1930s depression and the fear of unemployment. Having lived through the privations of a capitalist system that palpably did not work, they found themselves locked in a world war against fascism. It seemed that the good life would never come their way. For them, it was about belt-tightening, facing any hardship, pulling together and, ultimately, coming through. The searing experience incubated a collective purpose: to build so that it could never happen again. Their legacy \u2013 the mixed economy, the welfare state, European and global institutions designed to promote trade, collaboration, peace and help for developing countries \u2013 has been resilient enough to offer my generation what they did not have. Above all, the D-day celebrations signify a shared purpose now lost. What was so painfully won is being put insouciantly to one side, from crucial values to the tools of economic management, and a society absent of an overriding shared purpose is unable to muster resistance. Contemporary capitalism, left too much to its own devices by the rightwing proposition that the state must keep out of the economy, does not work. The inequalities it has thrown up are, as in the 1930s, provoking powerful societal protests. And, as in the 1930s, a new wave of demagogues, of whom Nigel Farage is a prime example, is blaming an out-of-touch elite for misgoverning a population needy of change. Foreigners must lie at the root of our ills and there is no greater or more intrusive foreign agent than the European Union. Vote Brexit \u2013 it offers a purpose otherwise lacking. Incredibly, there are even British rightwing politicians using exactly the same language as Hitler and Mussolini. For both dictators, the popular will, expressed in referendums manipulated to produce the right result, had to override parliaments and democratic assemblies, which must be suspended or prorogued if they oppose it. Yet Tory leader hopeful Dominic Raab, deranged by the religion of Brexit, proposes just such a suspension of parliament this autumn to deliver a no-deal Brexit. It is crazed and totalitarian in its spirit, the antithesis of what the millions, including my father, fought for 75 years ago. The feebleness of the reaction \u2013 no such man should ever be entrusted with the prime ministership of Britain or even a position in its government \u2013 betokens how far we have sunk. I can write my columns for as long as you are willing to read them, but words do not have the same impact as lived experience. The wartime generation were so shaped by what they lived through that they created the institutions that have served us so well. Maybe the British will have to live through a suspended parliament and the mayhem of a no-deal Brexit to learn that the ultra-populist right, with all its hatred of the other and of international collaboration, offers no worthwhile answer. Rather, our purpose lies in rebuilding the values and institutions bequeathed to us by that wartime generation. If the D-day celebrations made any contribution to promoting again a collective way of thinking, they will have been worth their weight in gold. \u2022 Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",

In Northampton, turnout jumped 11% from 2012.</p> <p>\u201cAt 8 o\u2019clock at night, they were five and six wide, all the way around the building, and all the way out to the parking lot,\u201d said Larry Hallett at the time, describing voting lines. \u201cTrump all the way. And that\u2019s the way it went.\u201d</p> <p>But since then, the electorate in Northampton has changed. While some older voters have died, new residents \u2013 commuters, retirees, warehouse industry employees \u2013 have moved in, and a flood of new voters has entered the field, with turnout among young voters tripling from the midterm elections of 2014 to the midterm elections of 2018.</p> <p>That turnout drove huge gains for Democrats in the Pennsylvania state legislature, while the Democratic governor won re-election with 57% of the vote. In a US senate race, the incumbent Democrat beat a virulently anti-immigrant Trump cutout by 13 points.</p> <p>\u201cWhat was very impressive in 2018, for a midterm election, were turnout levels among youth voters,\u201d said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \u201cAnd if you add that group in the mix, if you look at where the president stands in that group \u2013 it\u2019s daunting math for the president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"f921b9abb9fa4fa775e6ad8e1dd7a173e8d1160e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f921b9abb9fa4fa775e6ad8e1dd7a173e8d1160e/0_0_7059_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Left: Connie Butto checks out a snowglobe, among the thousands of donated items for sale at the 45th annual \u2018Boutique at the Rink\u2019.

But he also drew a lot of votes from people here who avidly disliked his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In dozens of interviews in the last three years with Northampton county voters, including Democrats who supported Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jul/20/donald-trump-support-base-hillary-clinton-hatred-pennsylvania\">antipathy towards Clinton</a> came up again and again as the main reason for their votes. A similar boost \u2013 call it the \u201chater vote\u201d \u2013 is not likely to be available to Trump in 2020.</p> <p>The most problematic candidate in the 2020 race for Trump, however, might be Trump. No incumbent president <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/approval-ratings-and-re-election-odds/\">in the history for which we have reliable numbers</a> has won re-election with less than around 49% approval. For pretty much his entire presidency, Trump\u2019s average approval rating has been stuck where it is now, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/\">around 41%</a>, give or take a few points.</p> <p>Trump, however, still has time to lift his approval rating. And there is always the chance that this time, history might not apply.</p> <h2><strong>How Trump could win</strong></h2> <p>The key challenge for Trump in Pennsylvania is to create excitement that not only turns out his base, but spills over into voters who did not catch the fever in 2016, said Borick.</p> <p>\u201cThe popular wisdom is that Trump squeezed about just as much as he could out of the state last time\u201d in terms of voter turnout, said Borick. \u201cBut if he can keep those folks aboard, and maybe bring in a few more folks on the margin, who maybe didn\u2019t vote at all in 2016, then he can make further gains.\u201d</p> <p>Snover, the county Republican party chairwoman, has a plan to help Trump win again. \u201cWe\u2019re running the Stop the Nonsense campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we feel every issue the Democrats are running on and putting in the forefront is nonsense.\u201d</p> <p>Snover named the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/11/green-new-deal-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-ed-markey\">Green New Deal</a>, the campaign for abortion rights, Medicare for All, free college tuition and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/29/trump-impeachment-mueller-statement-cory-booker-democrat-demands-latest\">impeachment of Trump</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m hoping that the Democrats overplay all these things,\u201d said Snover. \u201cThey\u2019re not real issues that hard-working Americans base their vote on.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>People don\u2019t like socialism.

And as we sort out who he\u2019s going to run against \u2013 will it be a socialist, or will it be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/29/joe-biden-pennsylvania-first-campaign-event-2020\">[Joe] Biden</a>?\u201d</p> <p>In conversations about opponents who could challenge Trump in Pennsylvania, the most frequently recurring name is that of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/29/joe-biden-pennsylvania-first-campaign-event-2020\">Joe Biden</a>, the former vice-president who was born and raised in the state and who currently dusts the Democratic competition in polls of Pennsylvania voters. The idea is that Biden could lure back the large proportion of registered Democrats in Northampton and elsewhere who switched sides to vote for Trump in 2016.</p> <p>But counterbalancing that theory, for Democrats, is the concern that a candidate like Biden, a white man and a senior citizen, would sap the enthusiasm of grassroots progressives looking for a fresh face.</p> <p>It\u2019s not yet clear which other Democratic candidate might emerge to challenge Trump here. Many supporters of the president are quick to take Trump up on his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/28/cpac-trump-2020-conservatives-democrats-bernie-sanders\">branding of the entire field as \u201csocialist</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/28/cpac-trump-2020-conservatives-democrats-bernie-sanders\">\u201d</a>.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t like socialism.

      "bodyText": "In the lead-up to the 2016 election, Larry Hallett erected Donald Trump billboards outside his roadside diner in eastern Pennsylvania, where he handed out Trump bumper stickers and presided over big breakfasts with a dozen or so regulars who got together to share their excitement about the Republican nominee. When Trump won, Hallett \u2013 an 81-year-old who restored classic cars on the side and led a Bible study \u2013 called it one of the highlights of his life. \u201cIt\u2019ll be fantastic,\u201d he predicted. Throughout Trump\u2019s first year in office, Hallett remained an enthusiastic fan of the president. \u201cI\u2019m pretty happy with the man,\u201d he would say. But, early in 2018, tragedy struck. Hallett went in for heart surgery and did not make it. \u201cEverybody was dumbfounded when they found out that he passed away,\u201d said Joan Hallett, his wife of 62 years. \u201cWe had an awful time, when we had to write up the obituary \u2013 he did about anything that you could possibly do.\u201d The old politics breakfast group had dwindled, she said. \u201cYou know we had this whole group of people, we talked about everything in there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re slowly dying off.\u201d In the two and a half years since Trump became president, his bedrock of support has not shifted. People who love Trump still love Trump. But life has changed in Northampton county, Pennsylvania, one of those crucial swing counties nationwide that voted twice for Barack Obama before flipping for Trump \u2013 and which could decide whether Trump gets a second term. If Trump wins here in 2020, he has a great shot at retaking the state of Pennsylvania, and at recapturing the White House, political analysts say. But if Trump loses here, he might become the first one-term president since George HW Bush. The fight to re-elect Trump has begun With its unusual knack for electing politicians from both major parties, the region around Northampton county has a distinctive politics. It also has a distinctive history, as the former home of Bethlehem Steel, which for generations produced plates and beams for warships and skyscrapers \u2013 a symbol of American greatness if ever there was one. Do voters here think Trump has delivered on his promise to \u201cmake America great again\u201d? Despite Trump\u2019s repeated proclamations that, thanks to him, the US steel industry is now \u201cbooming\u201d, steel in Bethlehem has shown zero signs of resurgence, former workers say. Frank Behum worked at Bethlehem Steel for 32 years. \u201cThe president is a pathological liar,\u201d Behum said on a recent morning near the silent row of rusting blast furnaces that went extinct 25 years ago. \u201cHe can\u2019t help himself. He\u2019s been doing it his whole life and getting away with it.\u201d Some former steelworkers remain supportive of Trump, saying the president is doing his best to jump-start the manufacturing sector in the face of what they see as Democratic obstruction. But the question for Trump here is not whether he can hold his core supporters. It is whether he can expand his appeal enough to overcome lackluster approval ratings and a galvanized Democratic opposition, to find the extra votes he will need for re-election. \u201cI have challenges. I have more to gain. I definitely have challenges,\u201d said the Northampton county Republican party chairwoman Lee Snover, describing her effort to re-elect Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve got to hold what I have, and I actually have to get new people. And I have to get more Democrats. \u201cBut here\u2019s the thing: I\u2019m banking on the Democrats continuing to be foolish and push nonsense.\u201d The fight to re-elect Trump has begun. With the first Democratic primary debates on the horizon at the end of June, here\u2019s what it looks like in Northampton county, Pennsylvania. How Trump could lose Trump\u2019s victory in Northampton county in 2016 was built on a combination of factors: the candidates in play, the policy terrain and the electorate. All three of those things have changed in Northampton county in the last two and a half years \u2013 each in ways that might look not so good for Trump. The electorate has changed On election night 2016, the more white, rural areas of Northampton county witnessed the same turnout phenomenon that played out in the Florida panhandle, the Ohio rust belt and the Michigan exurbs. In Northampton, turnout jumped 11% from 2012. \u201cAt 8 o\u2019clock at night, they were five and six wide, all the way around the building, and all the way out to the parking lot,\u201d said Larry Hallett at the time, describing voting lines. \u201cTrump all the way. And that\u2019s the way it went.\u201d But since then, the electorate in Northampton has changed. While some older voters have died, new residents \u2013 commuters, retirees, warehouse industry employees \u2013 have moved in, and a flood of new voters has entered the field, with turnout among young voters tripling from the midterm elections of 2014 to the midterm elections of 2018. That turnout drove huge gains for Democrats in the Pennsylvania state legislature, while the Democratic governor won re-election with 57% of the vote. In a US senate race, the incumbent Democrat beat a virulently anti-immigrant Trump cutout by 13 points. \u201cWhat was very impressive in 2018, for a midterm election, were turnout levels among youth voters,\u201d said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. \u201cAnd if you add that group in the mix, if you look at where the president stands in that group \u2013 it\u2019s daunting math for the president.\u201d Healthcare has become a key issue In 2016, when Trump ran on a call to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obama\u2019s healthcare law, known as Obamacare, polling indicated that the policy stance did not move the needle much either way for him. But since then, when it comes to healthcare policy, Trump\u2019s approval rating in Pennsylvania has dived, while it has solidified as the No 1 most important issue for voters. According to this year\u2019s edition of the annual Pennsylvania Health Poll conducted by the Muhlenberg College Public Health Program, a majority (51%) of Pennsylvania residents disapprove of the way that Trump is handling the issue of healthcare, with only 28% approving. \u201cIf you look right now, it remains, I think, from a policy perspective, his greatest weakness going into 2020 in Pennsylvania,\u201d said Borick. \u201cHe\u2019s below 30% approval rating on this particular issue. There\u2019s lots of strong disapproval, while the Affordable Care Act [Obamacare] is fairly popular in the state. \u201cI don\u2019t know how he fixes that issue before the election.\u201d The \u2018hater vote\u2019 Three years ago, Trump was a popular candidate in Northampton county. But he also drew a lot of votes from people here who avidly disliked his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. In dozens of interviews in the last three years with Northampton county voters, including Democrats who supported Trump, antipathy towards Clinton came up again and again as the main reason for their votes. A similar boost \u2013 call it the \u201chater vote\u201d \u2013 is not likely to be available to Trump in 2020. The most problematic candidate in the 2020 race for Trump, however, might be Trump. No incumbent president in the history for which we have reliable numbers has won re-election with less than around 49% approval. For pretty much his entire presidency, Trump\u2019s average approval rating has been stuck where it is now, around 41%, give or take a few points. Trump, however, still has time to lift his approval rating. And there is always the chance that this time, history might not apply. How Trump could win The key challenge for Trump in Pennsylvania is to create excitement that not only turns out his base, but spills over into voters who did not catch the fever in 2016, said Borick. \u201cThe popular wisdom is that Trump squeezed about just as much as he could out of the state last time\u201d in terms of voter turnout, said Borick. \u201cBut if he can keep those folks aboard, and maybe bring in a few more folks on the margin, who maybe didn\u2019t vote at all in 2016, then he can make further gains.\u201d Snover, the county Republican party chairwoman, has a plan to help Trump win again. \u201cWe\u2019re running the Stop the Nonsense campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause we feel every issue the Democrats are running on and putting in the forefront is nonsense.\u201d Snover named the Green New Deal, the campaign for abortion rights, Medicare for All, free college tuition and the impeachment of Trump. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that the Democrats overplay all these things,\u201d said Snover. \u201cThey\u2019re not real issues that hard-working Americans base their vote on.\u201d Talk to Trump supporters, and it\u2019s easy to see how Snover\u2019s message could resonate. \u201cIf anything, the Democrats continuing to do what they\u2019re doing is making the resolve of those of us that support him that much stronger,\u201d said Bruce Haines, a hotelier and former steel executive. \u201cThe fact that they continue to harass him like this just strengthens the resolve of the people I talk to \u2013 not just the Trump supporters, but the Trump-agenda supporters. \u201cSo I think support is going to strengthen as we get closer to the election. And as we sort out who he\u2019s going to run against \u2013 will it be a socialist, or will it be [Joe] Biden?\u201d In conversations about opponents who could challenge Trump in Pennsylvania, the most frequently recurring name is that of Joe Biden, the former vice-president who was born and raised in the state and who currently dusts the Democratic competition in polls of Pennsylvania voters. The idea is that Biden could lure back the large proportion of registered Democrats in Northampton and elsewhere who switched sides to vote for Trump in 2016. But counterbalancing that theory, for Democrats, is the concern that a candidate like Biden, a white man and a senior citizen, would sap the enthusiasm of grassroots progressives looking for a fresh face. It\u2019s not yet clear which other Democratic candidate might emerge to challenge Trump here. Many supporters of the president are quick to take Trump up on his branding of the entire field as \u201csocialist\u201d. \u201cPeople don\u2019t like socialism. People that are working people, you know?\u201d said Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 78, who has cut hair in downtown Bethlehem for five decades and who switched parties from Democrat to Republican in 2016 to vote for Trump. \u201cThe socialists don\u2019t know how to pay the bills.\u201d Snover, who calls hardcore supporters of the president \u201cTrumpers\u201d, expressed confidence that despite the Republicans\u2019 lackluster performance in the midterms, Trump voters would materialize in 2020. \u201cI just think these Trumpers are a different animal, they\u2019re like a sleeping giant,\u201d she said. The Promise \u201cIn one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming!\u201d Trump tweeted last month. If that were true, few Americans would be more capable of declaring it so than Ron Keschl, 76, who had five main jobs at Bethlehem Steel over four decades: sintering plant foreman, ore yard foreman, car tip foreman, blast furnace drillman and coke works foreman. \u201cI don\u2019t feel it around here,\u201d Keschl said of Trump\u2019s claim that US steel is back. \u201cI don\u2019t feel anything around here. You can\u2019t get it back. That whole thing is gone.\u201d Two weeks ago, engineers dynamited one of the most powerful symbols of the former local industry, the 21-storey Martin Tower in downtown Bethlehem. The former headquarters for Bethlehem Steel is now a giant pile of rubble \u2013 with twisted orange steel beams set to one side for recycling. Summer is coming once again to Northampton county, when Saturday nights at the Trolley Shop, the Halletts\u2019 restaurant, are marked by gatherings of classic car enthusiasts featuring live music and outdoor dancing. Larry Hallett, the community pillar, used to emcee the event. \u201cEverybody misses him,\u201d said Joan Hallett. \u201cIt\u2019s hard. I just can\u2019t get over it, because we were together constantly.\u201d But as politics go, she said, not much has changed. \u201cWe\u2019re all for Trump yet.\u201d",

Around half of the UK\u2019s surrogacy arrangements are contracted commercially abroad, in the absence of adequate research or concern about the long-term impact of these deals on surrogates. Domestically, around a third of \u201ccarriers\u201d may also be the baby\u2019s biological parent. The precious \u201cgenetic link\u201d with a child that the commission hopes to offer more would-be parents, presumably evaporates, for surrogates, after handover. </p> <p>The commissioners\u2019 unwavering commitment to surrogacy clients requires them to set aside, too, the reasons why successive countries have restricted or banned <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-46466888\" title=\"\">commercial surrogacy</a>. The abuse of human rights also concerns the UN. Last year, its special rapporteur Maud de Boer-Buquicchio <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=22763&amp;LangID=E\" title=\"\">recommended</a> that, to counter exploitation and commodification of children, \u201cthe surrogate mother retains parentage and parental responsibility at birth\u201d (the Law Commission suggests the opposite). She added that there is no \u201cright to a child under international law\u201d.</p> <p>Hopkins\u2019s reforms seem more sympathetic to the delusion, long cultivated by fertility industry shysters, that the desire for a biological child \u2013 because others may have one effortlessly \u2013 cannot justifiably be thwarted. \u201cSometimes,\u201d the report says, rather carelessly of the implications for property, \u201csurrogacy can be the only way for people to have children who have a genetic link to them.\u201d</p> <p>Not all people, obviously. \u201cSurrogates are generally economically and socially less well off,\u201d the report confirms, \u201cthan intended parents.\u201d Unaccountably, affluent women almost never seem to have babies for very poor couples. But if the projected normalising of UK surrogacy will change little for impoverished childless people, it could usher in a golden age for post-Brexit manufacturing.</p> <p>Plainly, much will depend on adequate recruitment of strong, young, non-criminal surrogates, preferably with good teeth, and on judicious pricing. Purely altruistic surrogates, although these noble women do exist, are already too few to satisfy the increasing demand for own-gamete children. In any case, the commission hopes, with helpful regulation, to \u201cencourage those wishing to enter into surrogacy arrangements to do so in the UK rather than overseas\u201d.</p> <p>What figure would make the pregnancies worth women\u2019s while, while leaving us competitive with Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, the US? It is at this point, where the commissioners invite consultees to address appropriate remuneration and accounting, with due attention to receipts for extra food (\u201cwomen need additional calories during the final trimester of pregnancy\u201d), that the repeated echoes of Swift\u2019s breeding programme (\u201calways advising the Mother to let them Suck plentifully in the last Month, so as to render them Plump, and Fat\u201d) become actively unsettling.</p> <p>For the question of costs leads, inevitably, to that of insurance. \u201cPregnancy and childbirth,\u201d the men point out, \u201ccarry with them the risk of significant complications, including death, so it may be reasonable for surrogacy agreements to make provision for compensation if complications arise.\u201d Whatever the appropriate amount is for, say, \u201cthe loss of the surrogate\u2019s fertility following removal of her fallopian tubes or ovaries or a hysterectomy\u201d.</p> <p>So consultees might want to consider if it may be yet more reasonable to accept that desire for a genetically linked child can never justify asking a perfect stranger to endanger her health or life. Unless female survival is another subject of interest only to feminists.</p> <p>\u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist</p>",

Last year, its special rapporteur Maud de Boer-Buquicchio recommended that, to counter exploitation and commodification of children, \u201cthe surrogate mother retains parentage and parental responsibility at birth\u201d (the Law Commission suggests the opposite). She added that there is no \u201cright to a child under international law\u201d. Hopkins\u2019s reforms seem more sympathetic to the delusion, long cultivated by fertility industry shysters, that the desire for a biological child \u2013 because others may have one effortlessly \u2013 cannot justifiably be thwarted. \u201cSometimes,\u201d the report says, rather carelessly of the implications for property, \u201csurrogacy can be the only way for people to have children who have a genetic link to them.\u201d Not all people, obviously. \u201cSurrogates are generally economically and socially less well off,\u201d the report confirms, \u201cthan intended parents.\u201d Unaccountably, affluent women almost never seem to have babies for very poor couples. But if the projected normalising of UK surrogacy will change little for impoverished childless people, it could usher in a golden age for post-Brexit manufacturing. Plainly, much will depend on adequate recruitment of strong, young, non-criminal surrogates, preferably with good teeth, and on judicious pricing. Purely altruistic surrogates, although these noble women do exist, are already too few to satisfy the increasing demand for own-gamete children. In any case, the commission hopes, with helpful regulation, to \u201cencourage those wishing to enter into surrogacy arrangements to do so in the UK rather than overseas\u201d. What figure would make the pregnancies worth women\u2019s while, while leaving us competitive with Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, the US? It is at this point, where the commissioners invite consultees to address appropriate remuneration and accounting, with due attention to receipts for extra food (\u201cwomen need additional calories during the final trimester of pregnancy\u201d), that the repeated echoes of Swift\u2019s breeding programme (\u201calways advising the Mother to let them Suck plentifully in the last Month, so as to render them Plump, and Fat\u201d) become actively unsettling. For the question of costs leads, inevitably, to that of insurance. \u201cPregnancy and childbirth,\u201d the men point out, \u201ccarry with them the risk of significant complications, including death, so it may be reasonable for surrogacy agreements to make provision for compensation if complications arise.\u201d Whatever the appropriate amount is for, say, \u201cthe loss of the surrogate\u2019s fertility following removal of her fallopian tubes or ovaries or a hysterectomy\u201d. So consultees might want to consider if it may be yet more reasonable to accept that desire for a genetically linked child can never justify asking a perfect stranger to endanger her health or life. Unless female survival is another subject of interest only to feminists. \u2022 Catherine Bennett is an Observer columnist",

But when there are circumstances over which you do have control you do not behave in the way that, I\u2019m afraid, some of those six did behave.\u201d Over little more than three months Change UK was buffeted by both difficult political fortunes \u2013 in last month\u2019s European election it took just 3% of the vote \u2013 as well as public bickering over tactics, for example about tactical voting and whether to pursue a merger with the Liberal Democrats. But insiders say the disagreements were even more heated behind closed doors, punctuated by differences over leadership arrangements, threats to quit the party and lack of agreement over even the basics of the party\u2019s future direction. Some of the reported disputes bordered on farce, such as the party almost missing a print deadline for its European election leaflets because one MP wanted a different photograph, and official social media feeds being stopped at the instructions of one member, and then tacitly resumed by another. Meanwhile, sources amid those who quit argue that Soubry and Leslie \u2013 whose spouses are respectively treasurer and chief executive of the party \u2013 sought to run Change UK \u201clike a Soviet state\u201d. Soubry says she will stay as leader until an autumn conference, and has ruled out any idea of joining up with the Lib Dems. The split was clear, Soubry said, when Umunna told her he did not think Change UK should continue as a formal party. \u201cI said to him: the movement\u2019s out there, we just need to build a home for that movement, a political party. When he decided that he believed we should not stand candidates I was beyond even disappointed,\u201d she said. \u201cI believed in him, and believed he should be prime minister of our country. He was a major part of why I left the Conservative party. And here we were, having had a very difficult time, and obviously a disappointing set of election results. \u201cBut hell, 600,000 people voted for us, and we\u2019d found 69 candidates, many of whom have got more ability in their little fingers than some MPs across the whole of the chamber. Some seriously brilliant people.\u201d The five remaining MPs were \u201cabsolutely on the same page\u201d, she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got decades of experience between us. We\u2019re now going to turn our attention on building a membership-based party, and of equal importance we\u2019ve already started the work on formulating policies. That\u2019s already begun.\u201d",

I always say my hair talk makes <em>War and Peace</em> look like a subheading. There are many reasons for these ongoing dialogues. Afro hair carries with it a complex history and many women of colour have convoluted relationships with their hair, so detangling all of this takes time. Products also make up a huge part of the conversation. Finding products that work on chemical-free, natural Afro hair (particular with a tight coily pattern) is an unending pilgrimage. Afro hair, surprising to most, is actually quite fragile, has a tendency to dryness and breakage, so needs intense hydration. Alas, most products don\u2019t touch the sides. Curlsmith, a wonderful vegan and organic hair product line, works brilliantly and this treatment serum should be a staple. It is formulated with jojoba, avocado, oat, andiroba, macadamia and apricot, which softens, hydrates and transforms brittle hair. Despite the putty-like texture, it is light enough to be used as a daily moisturiser, but I find it really comes into its own when used as a deep conditioning treatment. The results are phenomenal. Unlike Curlsmith, most brands, shamefully, do not cater for Afro hair, which is another reason I have endless conversations about hair.<br><em>Curlsmith Intensive Treatment Serum, \u00a329, <a href=\"https://www.feelunique.com/\">feelunique.com</a></em></p> <h2><strong>On my radar\u2026</strong> three products that are all coming up roses</h2> <p><strong>Flower power </strong>Looks like a mist, acts like a serum.

My new favourites, however, are more selective still (only via mail at the moment so pre-planning is necessary): Tosier\u2019s 10g micro-batch tinies (\u00a38 for four). I mean what is 10g of chocolate? Thus far only in 70% or 90% cocoa content (more coming though), the bars are exquisite Sylvanian Family-sized: two, sealed and dosage-controlled in a foil packet. But so flavoursome (the Monmouth Coffee Company version is the best coffee-chocolate I\u2019ve ever tasted), even if you don\u2019t usually like 70% chocolate I implore you to try them.",

The battery can be fully recharged in under seven hours, meaning commuters can ride the machine to work, charge the removable battery and then ride home again. The scooters have an external charger and removable battery and can be charged at any common household socket. Electricity currently costs about \u00a30.15 per kWh, so using a Super Soco electric scooter means you will spend less than \u00a31.00 per 100 miles \u2013 or 1p per mile!</p> <p>The CUX is a ideal for anyone who wants to travel to work, but doesn\u2019t want the expense of a bigger motorbike or the modest exertion of an electric bicycle. It costs \u00a32,099 (including a government grant) so it\u2019s priced in the same range as some of the posher e-bikes. The scooter is comfortable, nimble, nippy and soaks up the bumps and lumps of our pitted roads with ease. It\u2019s all-in-one bodywork gives it a smooth and modern look \u2013 as if it has been designed by a freelancer from Apple.

      "body": "<p>It was great to see Sonia Sodha highlighting the potential unfairness of carbon taxes and promoting the possibility of rationing as an alternative policy to combat climate change (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/01/sin-taxes-on-meat-or-flying-wont-change-a-climate-hypocrite-like-me-rationing-might\" title=\"\">Sin taxes on meat or flying won\u2019t change a climate hypocrite like me. Rationing might</a>\u201d, Comment). In relation to what Sodha calls climate hypocrisy, it is worth noting that, according to a wartime Home Intelligence report from May 1942, the British public showed \u201ca complete and expressed unwillingness to make voluntary sacrifices, but an apparent readiness to face compulsory sacrifices without undue grumbling\u201d.</p> <p>However, Sodha suggests that we modernise rationing, introducing a market and allocating \u201cpolluting credits\u201d allowing people to buy and sell rations. But would this be an improvement? Arguably, the rejection of markets, and a commitment to fair shares, is precisely what made rationing attractive to the general public in the 1940s. A report from 1941 stated: \u201cAs long as people believe that all classes and sections are suffering and enduring equally, they will put up with very great hardship. It is \u2018unfairness\u2019 that people resent.\u201d<br>Either way, Sodha\u2019s suggestion that rationing would be better than a carbon tax is supported by the historian Mark Roodhouse, who argued that rationing would be more effective than a carbon tax if a government needed \u201cto reduce carbon emissions quickly and dramatically\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Rob Lawlor</strong><br>Leeds<br></p> <h2>Poor nations need nurses too<br></h2> <p>Michael Savage has only considered the UK\u2019s need for additional nurses, not whether poorer countries can afford to lose their nurses (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/02/foreign-nurses-target-cut-from-nhs-staffing-plan\" title=\"\">Plan to hire thousands of foreign nurses for NHS is axed</a>\u201d, News). I lived and worked in South Africa, mainly in townships, and was shocked the first time I saw a full page ad from a private British medical recruitment company for doctors and nurses to work in the NHS.</p> <p>The vast majority of the white population in South Africa have medical insurance and are treated in state-of-the-art hospitals. The vast majority of non-white people live in townships and only the largest townships have a public hospital that does not demand money up front. The difference in medical treatment can be summed up by the fact that one private hospital in Johannesburg has more gynaecologists than the whole of the province of Limpopo.</p> <p>The depressing truth is that the UK does not train enough nurses or doctors and expects poorer countries to do the training for it.<br><strong>Michael Gold</strong><br>Romford, Essex<br></p> <h2>Politicians and \u2018the truth\u2019<br></h2> <p>I understand Kenan Malik writing of the risks if the law were to be the judge of the lies of canvassing politicians (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/democracy-is-victim-if-law-polices-politics-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">Democracy is the victim if the law starts to police politics</a>\u201d, Comment). But when is a lie not a lie? Only after a politician is elected? At some time, the law might be all we have. In an era when politicians have subdued our public broadcaster and we are alarmed at the dishonesty of overseas elected leaders, should we not be more careful about politicians here subverting their democratic licence?<br><strong>William Steele</strong><br>Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Herts<br></p> <h2>More PE is essential<br></h2> <p>\u201cAusterity\u201d in the form of cuts in school budgets and to the school sports partnerships programme may have contributed to the reduction in the time pupils spend in PE (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/01/perfect-storm-austerity-behind-130000-deaths-uk-ippr-report\" title=\"\">Austerity cuts are blamed for 130,000 preventable deaths</a>\u201d, News). The evidence suggests, however, that by far the most significant cause is the increased pressure on schools to produce good exam results in the core subjects.</p> <p>Even in the more limited time that students are in PE lessons, there is a growing tendency to pull them out for extra tuition in core subjects. At a time when, due to their excessive use of electronic devices, young people lead a more sedentary lifestyle and childhood obesity is on the rise, it is a national disgrace that young people\u2019s opportunity for physical activity at school has been so severely cut back. <br><strong>Chris Pratt</strong><br>Adel, Leeds<br></p> <h2>When history became history<br></h2> <p>In his perceptive article on the historical amnesia that is creating a Britain that is an \u201cunreal land of distorted memories\u201d, David Olusoga refers to the \u201cfog of historical amnesia\u201d that hangs heavily over postwar history (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/britain-cant-be-reborn-while-while-were-still-lost-fantasies-about-past\" title=\"\">Britain can\u2019t be reborn while we\u2019re still lost in fantasies about the past</a>\u201d, Comment). However, it has to be said that planned ignorance of British history, including recent history, has also played a key role in producing so many amnesiacs and part of the blame for this lies at the door of Kenneth Clarke MP.</p> <p>When Clarke was secretary of state for education and science from 1990-1992, the National Curriculum Council history task group was trying to slim down the content of the curriculum. Clarke decided to make history optional beyond the age of 14 and to rule out the study of events in the previous 20 years from the history curriculum. He was doing the country no favours by building ignorance of history into the education system, for it has helped to form the fantasy view of British history that sustains the case for Brexit.<br><strong>David Head</strong><br>Peterborough<br></p> <h2>My explosive wartime birth<br></h2> <p>Unlike Richard Norton-Taylor, I was not born on D-day but 20 days later, my arrival precipitated by Mother\u2019s shock at a V-1 flying bomb explosion in the grounds of her Croydon maternity hospital, which brought the ceiling down on her bed (\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/02/i-was-a-d-day-baby-at-least-i-wasnt-called-dwight\" title=\"\">I was a D-day baby but at least I wasn\u2019t called Dwight</a>\u201d, Comment). Six weeks later, she saved our lives by upending my pram in the porchway of a house as a Messerschmitt 109 pilot began strafing us. All this was happening while her husband was away serving in the RAF.<br><strong>David J Savage</strong><br>South Ockendon, Essex<br></p> <h2>Unfair visa system is wrong<br></h2> <p>The UK government\u2019s biased immigration policy is undermining \u201cglobal Britain\u2019s\u201d reputation and efforts to tackle challenges including climate breakdown, poverty, disease outbreaks and conflict.</p> <p>As leaders of organisations, institutions and programmes that are striving to strengthen the UK\u2019s position as a science, research and development world leader, we continue to be extremely concerned that growing numbers of African partners are being refused entry to the UK. A recent report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa highlighted that the number of UK visa refusals for nationals of African countries is twice the rate of those from any other part of the world.</p> <p>The UK Government International Research and Innovation Strategy states: \u201cThe importance of global co-operation to find solutions and to drive our long-term prosperity has never been greater.\u201d TThis co-operation must extend to all countries and regions.

      "bodyText": "It was great to see Sonia Sodha highlighting the potential unfairness of carbon taxes and promoting the possibility of rationing as an alternative policy to combat climate change (\u201cSin taxes on meat or flying won\u2019t change a climate hypocrite like me. Rationing might\u201d, Comment). In relation to what Sodha calls climate hypocrisy, it is worth noting that, according to a wartime Home Intelligence report from May 1942, the British public showed \u201ca complete and expressed unwillingness to make voluntary sacrifices, but an apparent readiness to face compulsory sacrifices without undue grumbling\u201d. However, Sodha suggests that we modernise rationing, introducing a market and allocating \u201cpolluting credits\u201d allowing people to buy and sell rations. But would this be an improvement? Arguably, the rejection of markets, and a commitment to fair shares, is precisely what made rationing attractive to the general public in the 1940s. A report from 1941 stated: \u201cAs long as people believe that all classes and sections are suffering and enduring equally, they will put up with very great hardship. It is \u2018unfairness\u2019 that people resent.\u201d Either way, Sodha\u2019s suggestion that rationing would be better than a carbon tax is supported by the historian Mark Roodhouse, who argued that rationing would be more effective than a carbon tax if a government needed \u201cto reduce carbon emissions quickly and dramatically\u201d. Rob Lawlor Leeds Poor nations need nurses too Michael Savage has only considered the UK\u2019s need for additional nurses, not whether poorer countries can afford to lose their nurses (\u201cPlan to hire thousands of foreign nurses for NHS is axed\u201d, News). I lived and worked in South Africa, mainly in townships, and was shocked the first time I saw a full page ad from a private British medical recruitment company for doctors and nurses to work in the NHS. The vast majority of the white population in South Africa have medical insurance and are treated in state-of-the-art hospitals. The vast majority of non-white people live in townships and only the largest townships have a public hospital that does not demand money up front. The difference in medical treatment can be summed up by the fact that one private hospital in Johannesburg has more gynaecologists than the whole of the province of Limpopo. The depressing truth is that the UK does not train enough nurses or doctors and expects poorer countries to do the training for it. Michael Gold Romford, Essex Politicians and \u2018the truth\u2019 I understand Kenan Malik writing of the risks if the law were to be the judge of the lies of canvassing politicians (\u201cDemocracy is the victim if the law starts to police politics\u201d, Comment). But when is a lie not a lie? Only after a politician is elected? At some time, the law might be all we have. In an era when politicians have subdued our public broadcaster and we are alarmed at the dishonesty of overseas elected leaders, should we not be more careful about politicians here subverting their democratic licence? William Steele Bishop\u2019s Stortford, Herts More PE is essential \u201cAusterity\u201d in the form of cuts in school budgets and to the school sports partnerships programme may have contributed to the reduction in the time pupils spend in PE (\u201cAusterity cuts are blamed for 130,000 preventable deaths\u201d, News). The evidence suggests, however, that by far the most significant cause is the increased pressure on schools to produce good exam results in the core subjects. Even in the more limited time that students are in PE lessons, there is a growing tendency to pull them out for extra tuition in core subjects. At a time when, due to their excessive use of electronic devices, young people lead a more sedentary lifestyle and childhood obesity is on the rise, it is a national disgrace that young people\u2019s opportunity for physical activity at school has been so severely cut back. Chris Pratt Adel, Leeds When history became history In his perceptive article on the historical amnesia that is creating a Britain that is an \u201cunreal land of distorted memories\u201d, David Olusoga refers to the \u201cfog of historical amnesia\u201d that hangs heavily over postwar history (\u201cBritain can\u2019t be reborn while we\u2019re still lost in fantasies about the past\u201d, Comment). However, it has to be said that planned ignorance of British history, including recent history, has also played a key role in producing so many amnesiacs and part of the blame for this lies at the door of Kenneth Clarke MP. When Clarke was secretary of state for education and science from 1990-1992, the National Curriculum Council history task group was trying to slim down the content of the curriculum. Clarke decided to make history optional beyond the age of 14 and to rule out the study of events in the previous 20 years from the history curriculum. He was doing the country no favours by building ignorance of history into the education system, for it has helped to form the fantasy view of British history that sustains the case for Brexit. David Head Peterborough My explosive wartime birth Unlike Richard Norton-Taylor, I was not born on D-day but 20 days later, my arrival precipitated by Mother\u2019s shock at a V-1 flying bomb explosion in the grounds of her Croydon maternity hospital, which brought the ceiling down on her bed (\u201cI was a D-day baby but at least I wasn\u2019t called Dwight\u201d, Comment). Six weeks later, she saved our lives by upending my pram in the porchway of a house as a Messerschmitt 109 pilot began strafing us. All this was happening while her husband was away serving in the RAF. David J Savage South Ockendon, Essex Unfair visa system is wrong The UK government\u2019s biased immigration policy is undermining \u201cglobal Britain\u2019s\u201d reputation and efforts to tackle challenges including climate breakdown, poverty, disease outbreaks and conflict. As leaders of organisations, institutions and programmes that are striving to strengthen the UK\u2019s position as a science, research and development world leader, we continue to be extremely concerned that growing numbers of African partners are being refused entry to the UK. A recent report from the All Party Parliamentary Group on Africa highlighted that the number of UK visa refusals for nationals of African countries is twice the rate of those from any other part of the world. The UK Government International Research and Innovation Strategy states: \u201cThe importance of global co-operation to find solutions and to drive our long-term prosperity has never been greater.\u201d TThis co-operation must extend to all countries and regions. It is vital to delivering life-saving work such as helping to bring an end to the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to ensuring that taxpayers\u2019 money makes a tangible difference and to promoting the UK as a venue for cutting-edge global debates. We must have a fair and equitable visa system that promotes and protects the essential collaborations that mean we can tackle today\u2019s global challenges as well as the unknown challenges of the future.

On the left, socialism, political correctness and identity politics are cudgels for beating the benighted into submission, winning professorial tenure and growing the Leviathan of government.</p> <p>For both groupings, \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d and the resulting right to be left alone are at best debatable propositions. Enter George Will\u2019s latest book, a bracing response to progressivism, \u201ccompassionate\u201d conservatism and neo-Caesarism.</p> <p>In the eyes of Will, a self-described \u201camiable atheist\u201d, rights precede government and are a bounty bestowed by the \u201cLaws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God\u201d, to quote the Declaration of Independence. They do not emanate from the state, nor are they conferred by majorities.</p> <p>Will, a columnist at the Washington Post and former panelist at ABC and Fox, now regularly appears on MSNBC. That says plenty about the state of 1980s Reaganism. It is no longer the religion of the party faithful, <a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2019/06/03/george-will-trump-has-as-much-to-do-with-conservatism-as-doris-day/\">a reality of which Will is acutely aware</a> but which he refuses to embrace as his own.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In my book the name Donald Trump doesn\u2019t appear \u2026 Neither does the name of Charlemagne or Doris Day or Humphrey Bogart</p> <footer> <cite>George Will</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Will recently explained, \u201cYou may notice that in my book the name Donald Trump doesn\u2019t appear \u2026 Neither does the name of Charlemagne or Doris Day or Humphrey Bogart. None of them have anything to do with conservatism.\u201d</p> <p>Many would beg to differ, especially the president and his minions. Will has ceased to be a member of the GOP, which he brands a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/447181-george-will-conservatives-have-become-a-cult-of-trump\">personality cult</a>.</p> <p>The Conservative Sensibility, a 640-page tome, focuses on America\u2019s origins and development. Will happily observes that John Locke was a muse to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence and to James Madison and his constitution. As Will frames things: \u201cThe constitution is John Locke\u2019s political philosophy translated into institutional architecture.\u201d At that moment, the Word was made marble and given the force of law.</p> <p>By that same measure, when it comes to the civil war Will is a unionist to his core and an ardent fan of Abraham Lincoln. It is Lincoln\u2019s fealty to America\u2019s founders and foundational documents that enshrines him in Will\u2019s pantheon. On that score, the book opens with an excerpt from a speech Lincoln delivered in 1838.</p> <p>In Will\u2019s words: \u201cLincoln\u2019s greatness was commensurate with that of the founders because his overarching purpose was to reconnect the nation with the founders\u201d and their \u201cnatural rights tradition\u201d. For Will, as for Lincoln, the American experiment is about a certain July day in 1776 and what came next.</p> <p>Will captures Lincoln weeks before he is to assume the presidency, saying: \u201cI have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from sentiments embodied by the Declaration of Independence.\u201d</p> <p>The bright line running from that document to Lincoln conferred a legitimacy on his decision to keep the nation together at a bloody cost. In the end, the horrors of slavery ran counter to the spirit of Jefferson\u2019s best-known work, even if Jefferson was a slaveholder.</p> <p>The grandson of a Lutheran minister, Will looks back at history but is not mired there. He relishes social and technical dynamism and the grenade hurled by Charles Darwin. On the other hand, he has a bone to pick with Woodrow Wilson, progressivism, utopianism and majoritarianism.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>For Will, the political is not reflexively the personal. Nor is it driven by the urge to 'own the libs'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Will finds Wilson\u2019s belief in the malleability of human nature to run counter to reality, his missionary zeal to be overbearing and self-defeating, and his utopianism more harmful than good. In Will\u2019s view, increased inputs do not necessarily lead to greater or better outcomes. Nor do majorities necessarily deliver wisdom.</p> <p>Will peruses the 20th century and observes that government\u2019s failures rival if not exceed its successes. He also recalls progressivism\u2019s early affinity for eugenics. As a matter of policy and preference, Will puts a premium on personal autonomy, and that places him directly at odds with the arc of government over the past century.</p> <p>According to The Conservative Sensibility, the supreme court got it right in its 1905 decision in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/198/45/\">Lochner</a>, which struck down a New York law that set a legal maximum on the number of hours in the workplace as an unconstitutional encroachment on the right to contract. The court again reached the correct conclusion in 2003 when it ruled in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/198/45/\">Lawrence</a> that Texas\u2019s sodomy statute violated the constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process \u2013 over a dissent by Antonin Scalia.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bff9acd266fc0dffe09b8c79d7c7311b26cbf8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bff9acd266fc0dffe09b8c79d7c7311b26cbf8c/0_200_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Patrick Moynihan, presidential urban affairs adviser, and President Richard Nixon, seen in 1970.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Patrick Moynihan, presidential urban affairs adviser, and President Richard Nixon, seen in 1970.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Will argues that \u201cScalia, consistent in his majoritarianism, was as wrong about Lawrence<em> </em>as he was about Lochner.\u201d In light of Justice Clarence Thomas recently taking aim at contraception in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/18pdf/18-483_3d9g.pdf\">Box</a>, an unsuccessful challenge to Indiana\u2019s abortion laws, it is unlikely the debate over privacy and the reach of government will end any time before the 2020 elections.

Nor is it driven by the urge to \u201cown the libs\u201d. Among other things, The Conservative Sensibility brims with admiration for the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations and in the Senate.</p> <p>Will does not predict what comes next.

      "bodyText": "In America, traditional conservatives are not having a good day. Their amalgam of limited government, patriotism, rule of law and free markets is in retrograde. On the right, there are those who now yearn for a soul-filled state driven by \u201corder, continuity, and social cohesion\u201d and who demand that individual autonomy take a back seat in an ersatz Eden. On the left, socialism, political correctness and identity politics are cudgels for beating the benighted into submission, winning professorial tenure and growing the Leviathan of government. For both groupings, \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d and the resulting right to be left alone are at best debatable propositions. Enter George Will\u2019s latest book, a bracing response to progressivism, \u201ccompassionate\u201d conservatism and neo-Caesarism. In the eyes of Will, a self-described \u201camiable atheist\u201d, rights precede government and are a bounty bestowed by the \u201cLaws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God\u201d, to quote the Declaration of Independence. They do not emanate from the state, nor are they conferred by majorities. Will, a columnist at the Washington Post and former panelist at ABC and Fox, now regularly appears on MSNBC. That says plenty about the state of 1980s Reaganism. It is no longer the religion of the party faithful, a reality of which Will is acutely aware but which he refuses to embrace as his own. As Will recently explained, \u201cYou may notice that in my book the name Donald Trump doesn\u2019t appear \u2026 Neither does the name of Charlemagne or Doris Day or Humphrey Bogart. None of them have anything to do with conservatism.\u201d Many would beg to differ, especially the president and his minions. Will has ceased to be a member of the GOP, which he brands a personality cult. The Conservative Sensibility, a 640-page tome, focuses on America\u2019s origins and development. Will happily observes that John Locke was a muse to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence and to James Madison and his constitution. As Will frames things: \u201cThe constitution is John Locke\u2019s political philosophy translated into institutional architecture.\u201d At that moment, the Word was made marble and given the force of law. By that same measure, when it comes to the civil war Will is a unionist to his core and an ardent fan of Abraham Lincoln. It is Lincoln\u2019s fealty to America\u2019s founders and foundational documents that enshrines him in Will\u2019s pantheon. On that score, the book opens with an excerpt from a speech Lincoln delivered in 1838. In Will\u2019s words: \u201cLincoln\u2019s greatness was commensurate with that of the founders because his overarching purpose was to reconnect the nation with the founders\u201d and their \u201cnatural rights tradition\u201d. For Will, as for Lincoln, the American experiment is about a certain July day in 1776 and what came next. Will captures Lincoln weeks before he is to assume the presidency, saying: \u201cI have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from sentiments embodied by the Declaration of Independence.\u201d The bright line running from that document to Lincoln conferred a legitimacy on his decision to keep the nation together at a bloody cost. In the end, the horrors of slavery ran counter to the spirit of Jefferson\u2019s best-known work, even if Jefferson was a slaveholder. The grandson of a Lutheran minister, Will looks back at history but is not mired there. He relishes social and technical dynamism and the grenade hurled by Charles Darwin. On the other hand, he has a bone to pick with Woodrow Wilson, progressivism, utopianism and majoritarianism. Will finds Wilson\u2019s belief in the malleability of human nature to run counter to reality, his missionary zeal to be overbearing and self-defeating, and his utopianism more harmful than good. In Will\u2019s view, increased inputs do not necessarily lead to greater or better outcomes. Nor do majorities necessarily deliver wisdom. Will peruses the 20th century and observes that government\u2019s failures rival if not exceed its successes. He also recalls progressivism\u2019s early affinity for eugenics. As a matter of policy and preference, Will puts a premium on personal autonomy, and that places him directly at odds with the arc of government over the past century. According to The Conservative Sensibility, the supreme court got it right in its 1905 decision in Lochner, which struck down a New York law that set a legal maximum on the number of hours in the workplace as an unconstitutional encroachment on the right to contract. The court again reached the correct conclusion in 2003 when it ruled in Lawrence that Texas\u2019s sodomy statute violated the constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process \u2013 over a dissent by Antonin Scalia. Will argues that \u201cScalia, consistent in his majoritarianism, was as wrong about Lawrence as he was about Lochner.\u201d In light of Justice Clarence Thomas recently taking aim at contraception in Box, an unsuccessful challenge to Indiana\u2019s abortion laws, it is unlikely the debate over privacy and the reach of government will end any time before the 2020 elections. If ever. For Will, the political is not reflexively the personal. Nor is it driven by the urge to \u201cown the libs\u201d. Among other things, The Conservative Sensibility brims with admiration for the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations and in the Senate. Will does not predict what comes next. But it is also safe to say that America, the Republican party and conservatism are all in flux. The GOP is no longer home to John Cheever\u2019s world and aspirational America. In 2018, suburban moms flipped the House. Paint Greenwich and Rye reliably blue. These days, fewer than three in 10 Republicans are white voters with a BA or better. Instead, nearly 60% of the party\u2019s support comes from whites without a four-year degree. Even after Trump leaves office, don\u2019t expect Will\u2019s brand of conservatism to find a warm welcome in what once was the Party of Lincoln. To be sure, America is poorer for that.",

At these times, it becomes something savage, as an assortment of semi-literate grotesques gather to yell insults and throw eggs.</p> <p>On Thursday, it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/06/ex-mp-natalie-mcgarry-jailed-for-18-months-for-embezzlement\" title=\"\">Natalie McGarry\u2019s turn</a> to face these gargoyles. The former Scottish Nationalist MP, who has an 18-month-old child, was jailed for 18 months for embezzling more than \u00a325,000 from pro-independence campaign groups during and after the 2014 independence referendum. She is a first-time offender.</p> <p>During the trial, it was revealed that McGarry had fallen into serious debt and appropriated some of the money to fund a foreign holiday for her and her husband. This was fraud and deception at an egregious level, which left many of her former friends and colleagues at the Women for Independence group feeling heartbroken and betrayed. McGarry needed to face justice for her actions and the rest of us needed to see that it was proportionate and applied compassionately. What the sheriff Paul Crozier handed down is open to question on these requirements, but it fitted the pattern of how this country assesses guilt and measures crime. </p> <p>Some of us who encountered McGarry during the tumult of the independence campaign found a likable and gregarious woman, but one who didn\u2019t perhaps possess the tenacity for professional politics. This is a calling that seeks to flay its adherents until they are left with none of their emotional safeguards. During her trial, she sacked her counsel on several occasions and attempted in vain to reverse her guilty plea. The respected journalist and court reporter James Doleman, who covered the proceedings, <a href=\"https://bylinetimes.com/2019/04/25/the-rising-star-of-scottish-politics-in-the-dock-of-the-sheriffs-court/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>: \u201cWatching Natalie McGarry leave court today, nobody I saw expressed any righteous anger, just sadness at a life gone so terribly wrong.\u201d</p> <p>McGarry\u2019s mental fragility and what the prospect of being separated from her child might do to both of them seemed to cut no ice. This is modern, enlightened, progressive Scotland, where all roads lead to jail even when there is no danger to the public. In the course of a thousand years, it seems we haven\u2019t progressed beyond an atavistic and savage tendency to lock people up. But, hey, at least we no longer hang people. Instead, the taxpayer will pay at least \u00a330,000 to keep McGarry in prison. This is the price we pay for refusing to consider something more refined such as unpaid work and financial compensation, perhaps with a restriction of liberty sanction.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"471962696547e96a5bcd1ccafaa81233143f17d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/471962696547e96a5bcd1ccafaa81233143f17d4/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Eighty per cent of women in Cornton Vale jail were reported to have mental health difficulties.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Eighty per cent of women in Cornton Vale jail were reported to have mental health difficulties.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fergus McNeill, professor of criminology and social work at the University of Glasgow, said he had deep misgivings about the sentence but also a degree of sympathy for the sheriff, who in this case perhaps felt restricted in his options by McGarry\u2019s apparent reluctance to take responsibility for her actions or show remorse.</p> <p>\u201cWhat this case highlights,\u201d he said, \u201cis a system that can\u2019t cope with the disordered reality of the lives of many women who enter it. For many, chronic social, personal and health-related problems impede the production of the remorseful, compliant, docile subject that the law and the court wants to see before it will extend leniency. So it treats chaos and disorder as danger and defiance, which is why so many women end up in prison not because of what they\u2019ve done, but because they can\u2019t play the part the system needs them to play.\u201d</p> <p>McNeill\u2019s observations echo concerns raised in the 2012 <a href=\"https://www2.gov.scot/resource/0039/00391828.pdf\" title=\"\">Angiolini commission on women offenders</a> after Scottish government concerns about the high number of women we insist on sending to jail. The numbers stitched into the report are depressing: in 2010/11, under 2% of the women guilty of a criminal offence were convicted for serious violence; 75% of custodial sentences imposed on women are for six months or less; at 5%, the percentage of women in the 2010/2011 Scottish prison population was greater than 10 years earlier (3.5%).</p> <p>In addition, the imprisonment of women in Scotland increased at a greater rate than men and, in 2007, 80% of women in Cornton Vale jail were reported to have mental health difficulties.

      "bodyText": "Social media is a place to be avoided when it\u2019s time for a public execution. At these times, it becomes something savage, as an assortment of semi-literate grotesques gather to yell insults and throw eggs. On Thursday, it was Natalie McGarry\u2019s turn to face these gargoyles. The former Scottish Nationalist MP, who has an 18-month-old child, was jailed for 18 months for embezzling more than \u00a325,000 from pro-independence campaign groups during and after the 2014 independence referendum. She is a first-time offender. During the trial, it was revealed that McGarry had fallen into serious debt and appropriated some of the money to fund a foreign holiday for her and her husband. This was fraud and deception at an egregious level, which left many of her former friends and colleagues at the Women for Independence group feeling heartbroken and betrayed. McGarry needed to face justice for her actions and the rest of us needed to see that it was proportionate and applied compassionately. What the sheriff Paul Crozier handed down is open to question on these requirements, but it fitted the pattern of how this country assesses guilt and measures crime. Some of us who encountered McGarry during the tumult of the independence campaign found a likable and gregarious woman, but one who didn\u2019t perhaps possess the tenacity for professional politics. This is a calling that seeks to flay its adherents until they are left with none of their emotional safeguards. During her trial, she sacked her counsel on several occasions and attempted in vain to reverse her guilty plea. The respected journalist and court reporter James Doleman, who covered the proceedings, wrote: \u201cWatching Natalie McGarry leave court today, nobody I saw expressed any righteous anger, just sadness at a life gone so terribly wrong.\u201d McGarry\u2019s mental fragility and what the prospect of being separated from her child might do to both of them seemed to cut no ice. This is modern, enlightened, progressive Scotland, where all roads lead to jail even when there is no danger to the public. In the course of a thousand years, it seems we haven\u2019t progressed beyond an atavistic and savage tendency to lock people up. But, hey, at least we no longer hang people. Instead, the taxpayer will pay at least \u00a330,000 to keep McGarry in prison. This is the price we pay for refusing to consider something more refined such as unpaid work and financial compensation, perhaps with a restriction of liberty sanction. Fergus McNeill, professor of criminology and social work at the University of Glasgow, said he had deep misgivings about the sentence but also a degree of sympathy for the sheriff, who in this case perhaps felt restricted in his options by McGarry\u2019s apparent reluctance to take responsibility for her actions or show remorse. \u201cWhat this case highlights,\u201d he said, \u201cis a system that can\u2019t cope with the disordered reality of the lives of many women who enter it. For many, chronic social, personal and health-related problems impede the production of the remorseful, compliant, docile subject that the law and the court wants to see before it will extend leniency. So it treats chaos and disorder as danger and defiance, which is why so many women end up in prison not because of what they\u2019ve done, but because they can\u2019t play the part the system needs them to play.\u201d McNeill\u2019s observations echo concerns raised in the 2012 Angiolini commission on women offenders after Scottish government concerns about the high number of women we insist on sending to jail. The numbers stitched into the report are depressing: in 2010/11, under 2% of the women guilty of a criminal offence were convicted for serious violence; 75% of custodial sentences imposed on women are for six months or less; at 5%, the percentage of women in the 2010/2011 Scottish prison population was greater than 10 years earlier (3.5%). In addition, the imprisonment of women in Scotland increased at a greater rate than men and, in 2007, 80% of women in Cornton Vale jail were reported to have mental health difficulties. Women were also 10 times more likely to self-harm than male prisoners and 35% indicated they had committed the offence to gain money for drugs (compared with 16% of male prisoners). Other numbers suggested the inevitable consequences of patterns of multi-deprivation and found links to female offending and severe physical and sexual abuse. Astonishingly, the Scottish government\u2019s response was to announce the building of another women\u2019s prison, although it cancelled the plan after public outrage and a campaign by Women for Independence. The government\u2019s subsequent plans for a small, secure prison and a number of community units are proceeding at a glacial pace. Governments can be forced to change attitudes and the judiciary can be altered, over time, to reflect more authentically the tides that ebb and flow beneath real lives and beyond the anointed existences of their lordships. However, what seems harder to change is the mob rule of social media. What moves people to shout their glee on social media at the downfall of another human being? I hope that if they or their loved ones ever take a wrong turning in life through simple human frailty they are met with more compassion and humanity than many are willing to extend to Natalie McGarry. \u2022 Kevin McKenna is an Observer columnist",

      "body": "<p>Cameroon, a central African state of 24 million people on the Gulf of Guinea, is rarely in the news \u2013 which is surprising, given the awful things happening there. In a warring world full of conflict, the country\u2019s troubles barely rate a mention. That\u2019s short-sighted. As Yemen shows, today\u2019s local difficulties have a habit of becoming tomorrow\u2019s international crises.</p> <p>Long-running tensions between Cameroon\u2019s French and English-speaking communities came to a head last week with the arrest of at least 350 members of the main opposition party, whose leader has been jailed since January.

According to a new <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/globalassets/pdf/reports/nrcs-list-of-the-worlds-most-neglected-displacement-crises/nrcs-list-of-the-worlds-most-neglected-displacement-crises.pdf\" title=\"\">Norwegian Refugee Council report</a>, Cameroon is the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis. Since 2016, conflict between government forces and non-state armed groups has forced 450,000 people from their homes.</p> <p>According to the report, \u201c780,000 children are out of school. Hundreds of villages have been burned down, tens of thousands of people are hiding in the bush with no humanitarian support, and attacks are taking place every day.\u201d Both the government and separatists are accused of \u201chorrific human rights violations\u201d.</p> <p>Though the specifics vary, Cameroon does not suffer in isolation. Its instability reflects that of its neighbours \u2013 Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic \u2013 and the wider Sahel region. Across this vast area, home to numerous other under-reported conflicts, the developed world\u2019s present-day neglect is sowing a poisonous future harvest.</p> <p>In Nigeria, the notorious <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/boko-haram\" title=\"\">Boko Haram</a> insurgency has been pegged back. But the rise of less-known Isis affiliates, such as so-called Islamic State West Africa, and regional jihadist groups is a cause of growing concern, <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/interactive/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/boko-haram-nigeria\" title=\"\">says the US-based Council on Foreign Relations</a>.</p> <p>About 2.4 million people in the Lake Chad basin are displaced. \u201cAlthough the Nigerian military has regained control in parts of the north-east, civilians in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger continue to be affected by grave violations of human rights, widespread sexual and gender-based violence, forced recruitment and suicide bombings,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/nigeria-emergency.html\" title=\"\">the UN\u2019s refugee agency says</a>.</p> <p>Investigations by the New Humanitarian project suggest the Sahel emergency is intensifying rapidly. \u201cA surge in violence in recent months in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left more than 440,000 people displaced and 5,000 dead as militants \u2013 some with links to al-Qaida and Isis \u2013 extend their grip across the region,\u201d it reported in May.</p> <p>The ramifications of this advance are dire. \u201cAs they gain ground, the jihadists are stoking conflicts between different ethnic groups \u2026 putting the region\u2019s entire social fabric into question. Cycles of inter-communal violence are now claiming more lives and uprooting more people than direct jihadist attacks,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thenewhumanitarian.org/in-depth/sahel-flames-Burkina-Faso-Mali-Niger-militancy-conflict\" title=\"\">New Humanitarian says</a>.</p> <p>Neglected or forgotten conflicts are by no means confined to sub-Saharan Africa. Nor are political, ethnic or religious tensions the only factors. Conflicts are often rooted in the failure of authoritarian, incompetent or corrupt governments to protect their citizens, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/06/sudan-african-union-suspension-military-rulers\" title=\"\">as in Sudan</a>. Struggling communities may fear state security forces more than they fear local militias, as in Kashmir.</p> <p>Yet the inattention of wealthy countries, coupled with the damaging impact of their economic and cultural behaviour, are powerful factors, too. Interventionism, and escalation of local conflicts by the co-opting of proxy forces, are on the rise, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/09/libya-crisis-anxiety-uk-blame-laid-doors-gulf-allies\" title=\"\">as seen in Libya</a> where rival states back opposing sides.</p> <p>At the same time, external diplomatic mediation and third-party peace efforts are declining even as the total number of conflicts rises, <a href=\"https://www.prio.org/News/\" title=\"\">according to Oslo\u2019s Peace Research Institute</a>. The western world has long fixated, for example, on the Israel-Palestine peace process. By contrast, no comparable commitment is seen in Somalia, ravaged by decades of conflict.</p> <p>Aggravating this neglect are inadequate, under-fire western foreign aid and assistance budgets. UN humanitarian appeals are routinely under-funded. Aid can become a political football, as happened recently in Venezuela.

      "bodyText": "Cameroon, a central African state of 24 million people on the Gulf of Guinea, is rarely in the news \u2013 which is surprising, given the awful things happening there. In a warring world full of conflict, the country\u2019s troubles barely rate a mention. That\u2019s short-sighted. As Yemen shows, today\u2019s local difficulties have a habit of becoming tomorrow\u2019s international crises. Long-running tensions between Cameroon\u2019s French and English-speaking communities came to a head last week with the arrest of at least 350 members of the main opposition party, whose leader has been jailed since January. Human Rights Watch accused security forces of using \u201cexcessive and indiscriminate force\u201d. Political repression may be the least of Cameroon\u2019s worries. According to a new Norwegian Refugee Council report, Cameroon is the world\u2019s most neglected displacement crisis. Since 2016, conflict between government forces and non-state armed groups has forced 450,000 people from their homes. According to the report, \u201c780,000 children are out of school. Hundreds of villages have been burned down, tens of thousands of people are hiding in the bush with no humanitarian support, and attacks are taking place every day.\u201d Both the government and separatists are accused of \u201chorrific human rights violations\u201d. Though the specifics vary, Cameroon does not suffer in isolation. Its instability reflects that of its neighbours \u2013 Nigeria, Chad and the Central African Republic \u2013 and the wider Sahel region. Across this vast area, home to numerous other under-reported conflicts, the developed world\u2019s present-day neglect is sowing a poisonous future harvest. In Nigeria, the notorious Boko Haram insurgency has been pegged back. But the rise of less-known Isis affiliates, such as so-called Islamic State West Africa, and regional jihadist groups is a cause of growing concern, says the US-based Council on Foreign Relations. About 2.4 million people in the Lake Chad basin are displaced. \u201cAlthough the Nigerian military has regained control in parts of the north-east, civilians in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad and Niger continue to be affected by grave violations of human rights, widespread sexual and gender-based violence, forced recruitment and suicide bombings,\u201d the UN\u2019s refugee agency says. Investigations by the New Humanitarian project suggest the Sahel emergency is intensifying rapidly. \u201cA surge in violence in recent months in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger has left more than 440,000 people displaced and 5,000 dead as militants \u2013 some with links to al-Qaida and Isis \u2013 extend their grip across the region,\u201d it reported in May. The ramifications of this advance are dire. \u201cAs they gain ground, the jihadists are stoking conflicts between different ethnic groups \u2026 putting the region\u2019s entire social fabric into question. Cycles of inter-communal violence are now claiming more lives and uprooting more people than direct jihadist attacks,\u201d New Humanitarian says. Neglected or forgotten conflicts are by no means confined to sub-Saharan Africa. Nor are political, ethnic or religious tensions the only factors. Conflicts are often rooted in the failure of authoritarian, incompetent or corrupt governments to protect their citizens, as in Sudan. Struggling communities may fear state security forces more than they fear local militias, as in Kashmir. Yet the inattention of wealthy countries, coupled with the damaging impact of their economic and cultural behaviour, are powerful factors, too. Interventionism, and escalation of local conflicts by the co-opting of proxy forces, are on the rise, as seen in Libya where rival states back opposing sides. At the same time, external diplomatic mediation and third-party peace efforts are declining even as the total number of conflicts rises, according to Oslo\u2019s Peace Research Institute. The western world has long fixated, for example, on the Israel-Palestine peace process. By contrast, no comparable commitment is seen in Somalia, ravaged by decades of conflict. Aggravating this neglect are inadequate, under-fire western foreign aid and assistance budgets. UN humanitarian appeals are routinely under-funded. Aid can become a political football, as happened recently in Venezuela. Meanwhile, environmental degradation linked to the climate crisis is increasing poverty and inequality, helping to drive conflict. Climate change, specifically drought, played a key role in sparking the Darfur genocide in the early 2000s, where farmers were pitted against herders. It is a factor now in Iraq, Egypt and other areas of the Middle East where competition for ever scarcer water supplies is intensifying. It is a factor, too, in a resurgence of preventable diseases, as in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The link to conflict is evident. \u201cEnvironmental degradation is starting to reverberate and affect economic growth,\u201d a Brookings Institution study of sustainability declared last month: \u201cDisasters triggered by weather and climate-related hazards were responsible for thousands of deaths and $320bn in losses in 2017 \u2026 Water stress linked to climate change is already contributing to migration, which in turn can lead to conflict.\u201d According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, political violence and protest surged worldwide last year. \u201cThese trends showed few signs of stopping in 2019,\u201d it says. In its list of looming flashpoints, relatively neglected conflicts in the Sahel, South Sudan, the southern Philippines and Myanmar feature alongside better-reported wars in Syria and Afghanistan. The International Crisis Group casts its net even wider. Rising tensions, from multiple causes, in Benin, Togo, Sri Lanka, Honduras, Nicaragua, Kosovo and Iran all need to be carefully watched, too, it says in its June CrisisWatch report. In one sense, it\u2019s an impossible task. In another sense, greater focus on conflict prevention and resolution in everyone\u2019s interest. The scale of the challenge merely underscores an inescapable 21st-century reality: rather than question multilateralist approaches, the international community needs to work together more closely than ever if, collectively, it hopes to survive.",

      "bodyText": "In olden days, communication from the bank was often along the lines of: \u201cDear sir, I\u2019m more than distressed by the state of your current account. Could we please revert to the situation whereby you bank with us, rather than vice versa?\u201d Nothing so simple in the complex world of banking and fintech. Consider the following from Andrew Beatty, senior vice president of global banking at FIS: \u201cBoth parties must apply constructive criticism appropriately... the fintech should not blindly accept all requested changes from the incumbent bank which could quickly take both parties off course and threaten the traction needed to progress in the engagement.\u201d Or this from Stephan Fabel, product director at Canonical: \u201cOnly by reducing network latency can the next generation of customer-facing services be realised within bank branches.\u201d It\u2019s all well beyond my financial capabilities and I\u2019m sure even my long-suffering bank manager of yore, who was a dab hand at customer-facing services, would be scratching his head. As he would by this proclamation from Matt Hancock, who the last time I looked was health secretary, but parked his tank on Penny Mordaunt\u2019s lawn in a foreign policy speech: \u201cThe future lies not in siloed services but in a full-spectrum, first-tier, day-one capability: special forces, cyber intelligence, working alongside the potential to project conventional hard power, combined with softer persuasive power, harnessed by a foreign policy steeped in diplomacy.\u201d Nuclear-strength eyewash, I think you\u2019ll agree, so Hancock, back to counting bedpans, please. To happier matters and a new word, to me at least \u2013 skeevier, the comparative form of skeevy, meaning morally or physically repulsive, disgusting, sleazy. Damned good word. Feel free to use as you will. \u2022Jonathan Bouquet is an Observer columnist",

He\u2019s had his awards and his TV appearances, and published a cook book. But in Edinburgh his name has sometimes been overshadowed by those of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/may/25/foodanddrink.restaurants\" title=\"\">Tom Kitchin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/01/the-honours-restaurant-review\" title=\"\">Martin Wishart</a>. It shouldn\u2019t be so. Recently, Greenaway moved out of his eponymous restaurant to this set of interlocking spaces off the ground-floor atrium of the <a href=\"https://waldorfastoria3.hilton.com/en/hotels/united-kingdom/waldorf-astoria-edinburgh-the-caledonian-EDNCHWA/index.html\" title=\"\">Waldorf Astoria Caledonian</a>. As with so many hotel restaurants it\u2019s a walk to get to the action, through two other huge dining rooms, which could be filled, but aren\u2019t. Think of it as a way of getting your Fitbit steps in, to mitigate the heft of what is to come. The third space is full of solid tables, the obligatory outbreak of tartan and lots of dark wood.</p> <p>Those deep shades are matched by the still-warm treacle and stout sourdough, the colour of an old leather sofa, with \u201cduck skin\u201d butter. It\u2019s bread and butter, but engineered for the Marvel Universe. It\u2019s full of deep, lusty caramel tones and the butter takes to it, as if to a welcoming lover\u2019s bed. It\u2019s superpowered and so irresistible I eventually have to get it taken away. The menu writing pulls the under-utilised trick of not telling you everything. Compressed discs of deeply piggy ham hock (or \u201chough\u201d, as here) served at room temperature, do indeed come with the advertised fried quail\u2019s egg and a fanned slice of dehydrated pineapple, the sharpness of which does bring something to the plate. But what makes it is the sizeable dollop of a foamy pea mousse. It turns the dish into a giggly take on pea and ham soup. The cleverness does not overwhelm its more obvious appeal, which is just how fun it is to eat.</p> <p>Another starter of a fried duck egg, laid at the bottom of a dish like a picnic rug, is covered with fragments of warm confit duck, slices of duck \u201cham\u201d and unexpected dollops of a bright parsley mayo. To show willing we order a third starter of a still-warm crumpet, heaped with curls of cured trout and with salmon roe. In the middle is yet another egg, this time poached. The repeated eggs in these starters was not intentional on our part, but as each one was perfectly cooked, the yolk ready to run in all the right directions, I\u2019m not going to complain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb59458251ad4defedf120c2a38e869e7a66bfd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb59458251ad4defedf120c2a38e869e7a66bfd2/1294_257_2798_3498/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Sensitively cooked\u2019: hake.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sensitively cooked\u2019: hake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The simplest of the dishes is a square of pork belly, slowly rendered over half a day, with crackling like glass, a \u201ctoffee apple\u201d sauce, a few greens and a big welcoming pillow of mash. It\u2019s meat and two veg that\u2019s had a facial, its nails done and a full blow-dry. It is drop-dead gorgeous. Even so, it is overshadowed by a sensitively cooked hake fillet, the skin crisped and given a spritz of acidity. Alongside is a shellfish boudin, wrapped in a roll of striped and silky pasta. The whole dish is brought together by a ripe bisque that tastes of the best of shells that have been roasted down to their essence, then lifted from their sticking place by a glug of booze. Simmer all that, strain, reduce again, then bolster with cream. And hurrah: a sauce that puts the headrush into lush.</p> <p>Even the two side dishes deserve note: golden rustling pieces of \u201cKentucky-fried\u201d cauliflower (the filthy bastards) and the pop of fresh peas and little gem lettuce bound by a bacony cream sauce. After all that take the hotel-length trudge to the loos. You\u2019ll need the exercise. Because trust me: here, you won\u2019t graze. You\u2019ll trough.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The winner among desserts is a brown sugar cheesecake with a florentine base</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A mixed plate of desserts provides the only head scratcher. A halved doughnut is decorated with bits of fresh strawberry and dollops of white and dark chocolate mousse, and simply isn\u2019t as nice as a freshly made, filled doughnut would have been.

      "bodyText": "After 18 years, Barrie Cassidy\u2019s final Insiders observation wasn\u2019t about the institution he had overseen as a stoic guardian of transparency and purveyor of truth. It wasn\u2019t even about the players who he had alternatively terrified and charmed for almost two decades from a Melbourne studio on Sunday mornings, while in the real world eggs cooked and coffee was brewed. It was about those who had always been at the heart of what he did and why. And it was those people who caused Cassidy\u2019s famously craggy face to soften in an emotional tide. The audience. \u201cThe night after Bob Hawke died I went to the John Curtin hotel in Melbourne \u2013 you were there, Mike [Bowers] \u2013 for old time\u2019s sake and I ran into a young bloke who said to me, \u2018a few years ago I went on Tinder\u2019. And I thought, oh, where is this going. \u201cHe said that he found a post from a young woman who said that she wanted to meet somebody who watched Insiders, preferably with a hangover. He got in touch, they watched Insiders and now they\u2019re married. \u201cHow good is Insiders! \u201cI say that for this point of view that I\u2019ll be thanking all of those around me later on, but it\u2019s the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s you that I want to just talk to you very briefly this morning.

Guardian Australia photographer-at-large and Insiders co-creator, Mike Bowers, who ambushed his friend and colleague on the couch for a surprise Talking Pictures segment paying tribute to Cassidy, said at the end of the day everything Cassidy had built was for those who watched. \u201cIt was very emotional but, as is Barrie\u2019s attitude, he wanted to fit in as much as possible in day-to-day politics, which is what Barrie is like.

      "bodyText": "Labor will examine any legislative proposals to protect press freedom in Australia, it\u2019s deputy leader says, with the storm surrounding last week\u2019s police raids on journalists showing no signs of abating. Labor has defended its role in helping to pass national security legislation which curtailed media freedoms and protections for whistleblowers in the past two terms of Coalition government, with the opposition sensitive to any criticism it was \u201csoft\u201d on the issue. But Richard Marles said Labor consistently attempted to add safeguards to the government\u2019s legislation, to ensure public interest journalism and those who contributed to it were protected, adding the government was distancing itself from the \u201cextraordinary\u201d scenes of last week. \u201cAt every moment along the way, we have been the proponents and responsible for amendments which go to the question of there being national interest tests which protect the freedom of the press,\u201d he told the ABC\u2019s Insiders program on Sunday morning. \u201cThat\u2019s actually our form over the last few years. We will have a look at whatever the government put before us in terms of propositions here. But the starting point is they\u2019ve actually got to come out and make it clear that, as a government, they support the idea of the freedom of the press. And right now, we haven\u2019t even heard that. Marles defended Mark Dreyfus, in his role of shadow attorney general, writing to the government demanding an investigation into the leak which formed the basis of Smethurst\u2019s story, as \u201cpointing out the chaos of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government and the fact they were leaking like a sieve\u201d. \u201cAnd they needed to get their house in order,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea that the remedy of that is to then go and shake down a press gallery with the federal police is ridiculous. The government needs to get its house in order in terms of how it manages information. That\u2019s not a question then about stopping the media from doing its job, and that completely crosses the line.\u201d Scott Morrison and Peter Dutton have both distanced themselves from the AFP raids, which saw the News Corp Sundays political editor, Annika Smethurst, targeted at her home for stories she wrote more than a year ago, and the ABC raided over a story from two years ago, for which an alleged whistleblower has already been charged. In the days following the raids, it was revealed the AFP advised it was not looking for conversations which involved politicians while Smethurst\u2019s home was raided, while the AFP also acknowledged it had dropped the investigation into the politically advantageous leak into security agency advice into the medevac laws the Coalition opposed. The final Senate makeup is yet to be decided, but the Centre Aliance senator Rex Patrick said if, as expected, his party\u2019s two votes form part of the balance of power, he would expect further protections for media freedom to be seriously considered. Speaking to Sky News, Patrick, who has previously argued for more protection for whistleblowers, said a free media should form part of Australia\u2019s constitution. The first amendment of the US constitution protects both freedom of speech and the media and has stood as an inalienable defence against attempts to discourage journalists from investigating those in power. \u201cRather than perhaps go back and adjust every single one of [the laws], if we had, as we should have, a provision in our constitution that protects freedom of the press, it would change the lens through which those laws were interpreted and, indeed, may make some of them completely invalid,\u201d he told Sky News. Any changes to the constitution require a referendum. Patrick said he believed the issue to be \u201curgent and pressing\u201d and worth consideration.",

      "bodyText": "The north Queensland MP Bob Katter has been recorded taking a membership pledge for far-right \u201cwestern chauvinist\u201d group, the Proud Boys, but has dismissed his actions as \u201clarrikinism\u201d. In the company of Australian members of the men-only fraternity, Katter recites into a bullhorn: \u201cI am Bob Katter and I am a proud western chauvinist. And it is us who brought civilisation to the world and we won\u2019t be apologising for it. \u201cDon\u2019t get in our way,\u201d Katter adds. US civil rights group the Southern Poverty Law Centre classifies the Proud Boys as a hate group and previously US law enforcement has highlighted the group\u2019s links to white nationalists. Katter\u2019s pledge was a slight improvisation on the pledge that all Proud Boys make: \u201cI am a proud western chauvinist, and I will not apologise for creating the modern world.\u201d A video of Katter taking the pledge was posted online in September 2017 and provided to the Guardian by the White Rose Society, an anti-fascist group. Alongside Katter as he makes the pledge is Queensland Proud Boy, Ben Shand, who runs several social media channels under the nom de guerre The Dusty Bogan. Shand has appeared under that moniker and his own name on Australian far-right podcasts like The Unshackled. On his Dusty Bogan YouTube channel, Shand has interviewed a number of Australian far-right figures, including Blair Cottrell. Cottrell has been a long-time organiser on the Australian far right, and who was extensively praised by the accused Christchurch killer Brenton Tarrant. In the interview, Shand speaks to Cottrell about several topics including the conspiracy theory of \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d. Shand\u2019s channel also features video from a Brisbane rally in support of white South African farmers last September, which was also attended by the former senator Fraser Anning, the Liberal MP Andrew Laming and several other Proud Boys. Another video features him handing out how-to-vote cards for an independent candidate in the Queensland seat of Blair, John \u201cSandy\u201d Turner, whose Facebook page is festooned with Islamophobic and anti-immigrant memes. In response to a question as to how he came to be in the company of Proud Boys, Katter commented in an email: \u201cMy irresponsible larrikinism often gets me into trouble. \u201cYoung blokes always come up to me on the street, at venues, so I think you\u2019ll probably find 4,000 examples of me mixing with irresponsible people,\u201d Katter added. Asked why he had recited their pledge, whether he was a member and whether he supported the group, Katter said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who this group is or anything about it.\u201d The Proud Boys were founded by Gavin McInnes, who was prevented from entering Australia for a planned tour last year on character grounds. McInnes publicly resigned from the Proud Boys last year just a week after the Guardian revealed that, according to law enforcement officers in Clark County, Washington, the FBI considered the Proud Boys an \u201cextremist group with ties to white nationalism\u201d. When asked if he was supportive of the decision to exclude McInnes from the country in 2018, Katter said: \u201cI would tenaciously back the government on their decision.\u201d He added that \u201cwe separate ourselves from extremist groups and we consider extremist groups to be very dangerous and have always backed any measures without curtailing freedom of expression. You can laugh at extremists but you want to keep your foot on their throat.\u201d He then wrote of his \u201cgreat passion for the First Australians\u201d. Elsewhere in Australia in recent months, far-right groups have attempted to infiltrate mainstream political parties, including Katter\u2019s former party, the National party. In recent weeks, chat logs involving the Proud Boys in the United States have reportedly shown plans for violence at rallies. While the group and its leaders have been mostly banned from mainstream social media platforms, Proud Boys groups, including Australia\u2019s Proud Boys, are using a less regulated messaging app, Telegram, for communications, recruitment and vetting. In the Proud Boys Australia vetting channel on Telegram, many young men have posted videos reciting the same pledge Katter did, in order to begin their membership process. Katter, the long-standing member for the rural Queensland seat of Kennedy, briefly counted Fraser Anning as a senator for his party. Katter has also been the subject of several viral political videos, including one in which he abruptly shifted from talking about same-sex marriage to crocodile attacks in north Queensland.",

Kitney says he still deeply regrets the decision.</p> <p>Then came Packer\u2019s financial split with his sister, Gretel, that plunged his private company into debt.

      "bodyText": "Crown Resorts\u2019 $2bn luxury casino and apartment tower rising at Barangaroo has been synonymous with James Packer, one of Australia\u2019s richest men, reflecting his greatest achievement as well as a heavy personal burden. Packer shed some of that load on 31 May, when he sold 19.99% of his stake in Crown to Lawrence Ho, his former business partner in a joint venture in Macau, realising nearly $1.8bn. The abrupt sale has led to dozens of articles about whether Packer sold too cheaply and whether he should have waited to see if the US casino operator Wynn, which pulled out after details of its planned buyout of Crown leaked, made a better offer. There has been speculation about how and when Ho patched up his once close relationship with Packer, forged during the 10 years the two jointly developed casinos in Macau and the Philippines as Melco-Crown. There have also been oblique discussions as to whether Packer is further retreating from corporate and public life, amid mental health problems that he has acknowledged have periodically threatened to overwhelm him. Damon Kitney records in excruciating detail in his book The Price of Fortune the heavy toll that running Crown has taken on Packer and its contribution to his serious bouts of depression. Since 2015, when construction began and Crown\u2019s debt topped $1.4bn, Packer had felt a rising sense of panic over his big vision, Kitney says. On the board of Crown, there have been concerns about whether the opulent tower is excessively over the top. Would the luxury apartments, the most expensive in Australia, sell? Only 25% have been sold so far. Would an exclusive high-roller casino work? And would the Chinese keep coming in the face of president Xi Jinping\u2019s crackdown on corruption and offshore currency movements? During 2015, Packer\u2019s business setbacks mounted. There were losses from his foray into Ratpac, his film venture in Hollywood with Brett Ratner. He retreated from plans for casinos in Las Vegas, and then took the hard decision to sell out of his investments in Macau with Ho and Melco to reduce Crown\u2019s debt. Kitney says he still deeply regrets the decision. Then came Packer\u2019s financial split with his sister, Gretel, that plunged his private company into debt. A crisis in his personal life followed, after his engagement to pop diva Mariah Carey came to an abrupt and very public end. The final straw came in October 2016 \u2013 the detention of 19 of Crown\u2019s staff in China, including the head of international VIP business, Jason O\u2019Connor, for breaching the country\u2019s strict laws against soliciting clients to gamble. Another breakdown \u201cThe horrors of 2016 had left Packer, for the third time in his life suffering a nervous breakdown,\u201d Kitney writes. \u201cThose who knew him well and saw the private pain of his two previous mental crises say this latest iteration was by far his worst. It led him in March 2018 to acknowledge to the world for the first time that he was battling mental health issues as he resigned from the Crown board for the second time in the space of two and a half years.\u201d Kitney, who received Packer\u2019s extensive co-operation, recounts the billionaire\u2019s high life after he won the Sydney casino licence in 2013. Packer found himself feted by Hollywood stars and casinos around the world. When he and Ho opened their Hollywood-themed Melco Crown resort, Studio City, Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese lent their star power to the launch and were part of what has been described as the most expensive corporate video ever. But by 2016, Packer was battling mental health issues and could barely leave the guest house on American filmmaker Warren Beatty\u2019s estate. \u201cMacau was so heartbreaking because I lost my reputation and serious people treat me differently both because of the charges that were levied against our staff in China and because we sold out of Macau,\u201d he told Kitney. \u201cWith Ratpac and Hollywood, Mariah, Israel, China, all of those things, I was like Icarus. I flew too close to the sun.\u201d Kitney goes on to detail how Beatty, media mogul Kerry Stokes and other close friends intervened to help rescue the billionaire from his deep despair. In March 2018, Packer was photographed entering a clinic in Boston and he made it known to the world that he was battling mental health issues. Now that he has brought his holding down to less than a clear controlling interest in the empire that he and his father Kerry built, the question is: what next? Those close to Packer insist he wants to stay at Crown, and say business and professional stress contributed to the problems he is trying to overcome. In a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on the day the deal with Ho was announced, Packer said: \u201cCrown has been a massive part of my life for the last 20 years and that absolutely remains the case today \u2013 my continuing Crown shareholding represents my single largest investment.\u201d The sale allowed him to \u201ccontinue my long-term involvement with Crown and at the same time to better diversify my investment portfolio,\u201d he said. He later told the Australian Financial Review he planned to seek advice from fund manager Hamish Douglass, who is the chairman of Magellan, and the former star Macquarie banker Ben Brazil, on how to invest the $1.8bn in cash he has reaped from the deal with Ho. \u201cI am obviously looking to diversify my investments,\u201d he said from Los Angeles. \u201cFortunately, I know people like Hamish Douglass and Ben Brazil, and I will be taking their advice closely.\u201d Ho\u2019s big plans Meanwhile, Ho appears ready to take a bigger stake in Crown if it becomes available. He has said he will seek a board seat and, subject to regulatory approvals, will welcome the opportunity for Melco to increase its ownership in Crown. At 19.99%, he would need to make a bid for the company to go further, although the creep provisions allow him to buy an extra 3% every six months without making a bid \u2013 assuming he meets the probity requirements to take control. Ho is already sounding like the boss, outlining plans to leverage Melco\u2019s databases of wealthy gamblers to bring more high rollers to Australia. He has signalled possible joint expansion into Japan, the new frontier for casinos. \u201cCrown\u2019s resorts in Perth and Melbourne are world-class entertainment destinations and I believe that Crown Sydney, much like Melco\u2019s Morpheus property, will create an architectural icon for the city, the country and the world,\u201d he says. The immediate task will be to turn around Crown\u2019s revenues, which have slumped thanks to a 12% fall in VIP takings in the second half of 2018. While Melco seems to be committed to rebuilding those, Ho has also adopted a new strategy in Macau of attracting wealthy tourists from China, who might spend thousands, rather than millions. That could mean a shift in direction for Barangaroo, which is licensed as a VIP-only gaming centre. During the New South Wales state election in March, both major parties ruled out changing the licence condition that prohibits poker machines at Barangaroo but with new voices at the board table, only time will tell whether Crown will be able to put pressure on the state government to relax the condition. And with Packer\u2019s influence waning, a change of direction would not involve a loss of face for him.",

      "bodyText": "A long-awaited statue of the AFL great Nicky Winmar will be unveiled at the Optus Stadium in Perth next month to commemorate the stand he took against racism. The statue, showing the moment Winmar lifted his shirt after enduring racist abuse from the crowd at a St Kilda-Collingwood match in 1993 and pointed at his skin, will be unveiled on Noongar country at the start of Naidoc week on 6 July. \u201cI\u2019m black and I\u2019m proud to be black,\u201d he told the crowd. The statue has been two years in the making. The announcement comes two days after the AFL apologised to former Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes for its failure to stand with him against the racist abuse that prompted him to end his career in 2015. Winmar, a Noongar man, started his professional football career playing for South Fremantle in the Western Australian Football League before being recruited by St Kilda. He said he hoped the statue \u201cencourages more conversations and education about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history and culture. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the AFL and the Western Australian state government for commissioning this statue, the artist has done an incredible job acknowledging this moment in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a surreal thing to be a part of and it\u2019s something my family are very proud of.\u201d The WA Aboriginal affairs minister, Ben Wyatt, a Yamatji man, said Winmar was an inspiration to young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. \u201cNicky\u2019s actions that day have inspired countless other young people in both sport and in life to stand up and be proud of yourself and your heritage,\u201d he said. Tanya Hosch, the AFL\u2019s general manager for inclusion and social policy, said the statue depicted \u201ca defining moment for calling out racism in our country\u201d. The Melbourne-based sculptor Louis Laumen based the 2.7m statue on Wayne Ludbey\u2019s iconic photograph. It was paid for by a combination of crowdfunding and support from the AFL, and had been waiting in a workshop in Melbourne for some months, according to reports in the West Australian, until delivery could be arranged to WA.
