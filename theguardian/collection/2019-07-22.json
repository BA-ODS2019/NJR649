Police and prosecutors have warned that in some cases, if victims do not allow the contents of their phones to be downloaded, they may not be able to pursue investigations.

Prosecutors insist that just because material is downloaded, it does not mean it will all be examined. The director of public prosecutions, Max Hill QC, insists that there has been no policy change and that legal safeguards restricting use of private information will be upheld.

So it\u2019s the perfect step for me.\u201d Leipzig\u2019s sporting director Markus Kr\u00f6sche said: \u201cWe are very pleased to have won Ethan Ampadu for a one-year loan. He has only 18 years of international experience and can play both in the defense and in the defensive midfield. \u201cDespite many English offers, Ethan has decided to join us, and we now have another top talent in our ranks that is versatile enough to give our squad even more variation.\u201d Leipzig, who are close to securing Ademola Lookman from Everton this summer, will tap into Ampadu\u2019s versatility with the teenager able to operate in defensive midfield and at centre-half. Lampard is to make decisions on the future of Chelsea\u2019s other fringe and youth graduates in what remains of the window, with others likely to move on season-long deals away from Stamford Bridge despite the club being unable to add to their own squad due to Fifa\u2019s transfer ban. Midfielder Adam signs on at Reading Reading have signed Scottish midfielder Charlie Adam on a one-year deal after his release by Stoke at the end of last season. The 33-year-old had been training at Blackburn during pre-season, but has opted to join the Royals for the 2019-20 Championship campaign. \u201cThanks to Tony Mowbray and everyone at Rovers for allowing me to train with them for the past few weeks,\u201d Adam tweeted. \u201cWas great to play and score a few goals. I wish them all the best this season. I\u2019m now ready for my next challenge.\u201d The Reading chief executive, Nigel Howe, called Adam \u201ca player with Premier League experience and pedigree at European and international level,\u201d and backed the former Scotland international to \u201cplay a very valuable role within what is a relatively young first-team squad at Reading.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Increasing the diversity of America\u2019s police officers will not necessarily cut racial disparities in fatal police shootings, according to a new study which claims that race-specific crime rates are a bigger factor than the race of the officer. Research published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday found that as the percentage of black officers who shot in FOIS (fatal officer-involved shootings) increased, the citizen shot was more likely to be black than white. In a similar vein, as the number of Hispanic officers went up, the person shot was more likely to be black or Hispanic than white. The authors, led by David Johnson, a social cognitive psychologist at the University of Maryland, College Park, said the link between officer race and the race of citizens fatally killed are the result of officers and citizens usually coming from the same population base. They claimed to find no evidence that white officers were more likely to shoot minority groups than officers of colour. Researchers came to their conclusions by creating a database of more than 900 FOIS that occurred in the US in 2015, including officer race, sex and years of experience, using information from the Guardian and the Washington Post. Researchers then analysed the different factors to try to predict the race of the person shot. The Guardian\u2019s the Counted investigation found that in 2015 a total of 1,134 people died at the hands of law enforcement and that young black men were nine times more likely than other Americans to be killed by police officers. While this latest study by Johnson acknowledges there are racial disparities in shootings, it claims race-specific crime rather than officer race best predicts the race of the victim. It found that in counties where minorities were responsible for higher rates of violent crime, a person fatally shot was 3.7 times more likely to be black than white and 3.3 times more likely to be Hispanic than white. \u201cAlthough officer race was related to racial disparities, the fact that black and Hispanic civilians were more likely to be shot by same-race officers was largely explained by similarities between officer and county demographics,\u201d stated the report. \u201cBecause racial disparities in FOIS do not vary based on officer race, hiring more diverse officers may not reduce racial disparities in FOIS.\u201d While it acknowledged that greater officer diversity would probably have other benefits \u2013 such as improving police understanding of communities and increasing trust \u2013 it said it would not \u201cmeaningfully reduce\u201d racial disparities in fatal shootings. It added: \u201cOne of our clearest results is that violent crime rates strongly predict the race of a person fatally shot. At a high level, reducing race-specific violent crime should be an effective way to reduce fatal shootings of black and Hispanic adults.\u201d The report also found that of all the shootings analysed, in 56% of FOIS a single officer fired their weapon.

And The Art of Growing Up does, at times, read much like the work of a principal who is fed up. Marsden says that this contemporary crop of teenagers is outperforming generations past in terms of academic achievement and political engagement, but he is fearful about their emotional health, borne out by statistics on the prevalence of mental health issues among the young. \u201cThe scale of the problem is massive.

In his new book about how we treat and understand children, Marsden \u2013 the author best known for his Tomorrow, When The World Began series for young adults \u2013 is in no mood for niceties about contemporary parenting. \u201cWe are seeing an epidemic of damaging parenting at the moment,\u201d he writes. \u201cI think this is a widespread problem,\u201d Marsden tells Guardian Australia. \u201cDamaging parenting\u201d is not equivalent to emotional abuse, but rather represents an \u201cill-conceived and misguided\u201d approach that is doing significant emotional damage, he says. In the past five years, he says he has found it more difficult to run a school (he is principal and founder of two). And The Art of Growing Up does, at times, read much like the work of a principal who is fed up. Marsden says that this contemporary crop of teenagers is outperforming generations past in terms of academic achievement and political engagement, but he is fearful about their emotional health, borne out by statistics on the prevalence of mental health issues among the young. \u201cThe scale of the problem is massive. The issue of emotional damage is pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cThe level of anxiety is something I\u2019ve never seen before, and I don\u2019t know how it can be improved.\u201d Media roundup The Australian reports that border patrol forces have intercepted a boat of asylum seekers heading for Australia, with around 20 Sri Lankans being taken to Christmas Island for processing. The Daily Telegraph reports on the previous criminal history of the woman accused of decapitating her mother in western Sydney. And the Courier-Mail says Queensland is getting serious about bidding for the 2032 Olympics, as premier Annastacia Palaszczuk leads a taskforce to investigate the cost, promising it could be \u201cthe best thing that ever happened to Queensland\u201d. Coming up The UK Conservative party is expected to announce the winner of the leadership race between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt this evening.

The foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, told reporters on Monday the migrant flow through Mexico had diminished by 36.2% since 7 June \u2013 when the Mexican government agreed to increase immigration enforcement to avoid Donald Trump imposing escalating trade tariffs. Figures from the National Immigration Institute showed an average of 4,156 migrants entered Mexico daily through its southern border during the week of 1-7 June. That figure fell to roughly 2,652 people a day during the week ending 19 July. Ebrard attributed that decline to the deployment of 20,000 members of a newly formed militarised police force and \u201cimmigration laws being enforced\u201d. He added: \u201cWe have not agreed on a number for the next 45 days\u201d \u2013 with the Trump administration \u2013 \u201cbut we\u2019re going to keep up this effort so the trend continues downward.\u201d President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador once promised to not \u201cdo the dirty work\u201d of any foreign government on the immigration issue, but his administration has taken action amid fears that Trump\u2019s fury over the steady stream of migrants could dent Mexico\u2019s export-driven economy. The US president, however, has recently complimented Mexico as the country detains and deports ever larger numbers of migrants \u2013 and fewer migrants make it to the US border. Migrant apprehensions on the US southern border fell in June to some 100,000 people, according to US data. Observers say the figures usually drop during the scorching summer months. Mexico\u2019s deal with Trump included a provision to revise the progress Mexico was making after 45 days. The two sides would also discuss designating Mexico as a \u201csafe third country\u201d for asylum seekers if it was deemed Mexico\u2019s efforts to stop migrants were inadequate. Such a deal would oblige asylum seekers, who currently make up a large part of those apprehended at the US border, to seek refuge in Mexico instead. Ebrard said on Monday that Mexico would not discuss the safe third country issue further and he did not know the Trump administration\u2019s stance on the issue. He added the previous deal was not addressed during a weekend meeting with the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. \u201cI can\u2019t anticipate what their stance is [on the safe third country issue] but the Mexican position is very clear.

      "bodyText": "The independent health advice panel overseeing medical transfers for asylum seekers languishing offshore says there were 73 admissions covering 43 people at the RPC Medical Centre on Nauru in the first quarter of 2019, with \u201cthe majority\u201d relating to mental health conditions. The first quarterly report of the independent panel, obtained by Labor under an order for the production of documents in the Senate, found that in addition to the 73 admissions, with stays ranging between one and 44 days, there were 8,260 medical consultations provided to people on Nauru in the quarter \u2013 mostly for mental health problems. The new figures underscoring significant problems with the mental health and wellbeing of asylum seekers, and people whose asylum claims have failed, came as the Liberal backbencher Russell Broadbent declared on Monday Australia could not continue with \u201cindefinite detention\u201d. The governor of Manus Island, Charlie Benjamin, also urged Australia to \u201cstep up\u201d and help resettle refugees from his province to a third country. The panel\u2019s report says 5,908 consultations to 237 people were provided at the Nauru regional processing centre medical centre, and 2,352 at the IHMS Nauru settlement medical centre, for a range of conditions, but \u201cthe commonest reason for consultation was for psychological reasons\u201d. In Papua New Guinea, the report says, there were 1,134 primary health consultations, 472 mental health consultations and 375 specialist consultations performed at East Lorengau refugee transit centre at Manus in the first three months of 2019. There were 21 admissions to Lorengau general hospital for 17 people, again predominantly for mental health conditions. During a visit to Canberra, Benjamin said the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d situation on Manus required urgent action. \u201cWe want their travel to come to an end, they have to find a place to go to, but I think the onus is really on Australia, because they [the refugees] don\u2019t want to be in Papua New Guinea,\u201d he said. Responding to a renewed offer from New Zealand at the weekend to resettle 150 people in offshore detention, Broadbent told the ABC on Monday the home affairs minister Peter Dutton was \u201ctrying to find a solution\u201d. But the Liberal moderate said he would \u201clike to see the government pursue issues that would go towards \u2026 there being nobody left on Manus Island and nobody left on Nauru in indefinite detention\u201d. Broadbent said many Australians \u201cthought we had dealt with indefinite detention under the Howard government\u201d and he suggested people should contact the prime minister and Dutton \u201cto say this is how we feel\u201d. \u201cIt often takes a catalyst of an individual issue to be raised around indefinite detention,\u201d Broadbent said. \u201cI just find it personally unacceptable for the nation that we are, for the free and wonderful nation that we are \u2026 and we have to take every opportunity that is there to remove these people from indefinite detention.\u201d The Morrison government is expected this week to proceed in the House of Representatives with a bill repealing the medevac procedures overseen by the independent health panel \u2013 arrangements imposed on the government last year by the crossbench during the period when the Coalition governed in minority. But the repeal will be the subject of a Senate inquiry. The Senate\u2019s legal and constitutional legislative committee will report in late October, which means the earliest the regime could be scrapped is the parliamentary sittings in November. One of the key kingmakers in the Senate, the Centre Alliance crossbench senator Stirling Griff, has put the Morrison government on notice that repealing the medical evacuations bill would \u201csully the relationship\u201d between himself and the Coalition. The panel notes in its first assessment there are \u201creasonable quality primary and secondary care\u201d services on Nauru \u201csupplemented on a periodic basis by the availability of specialist services\u201d. It notes on Nauru there are 53 contracted health professionals, including 23 mental health professionals. It says there are significant numbers of mental health workers on Nauru but \u201cthere is no access to high-quality inpatient psychiatric care in Nauru and patients with severe mental illness and at high risk of suicide should be transferred to a hospital with appropriate inpatient psychiatric care\u201d. At the time the report was written the panel said they intended to visit Nauru in September to \u201cmore fully understand the scope of health services\u201d. The panel said it was \u201cimpressed\u201d with the facilities offered at the hospital at Port Moresby and was \u201creasonably confident\u201d that acute inpatient mental health treatment could be provided, but it also noted there was no access to electroconvulsive therapy of psychiatric intensive care for patients.",

Rory McIlroy\u2019s participation in the 2007 European Amateur Team Championship in Ayrshire, won by Ireland, came just days before an Open Championship debut at Carnoustie. It was never a case of \u2018Whatever happened to Shane Lowry\u2019 but his teammate claimed by far the greater weight of attention before events at Royal Portrush on Sunday. Twelve years and a few heartaches on Lowry is in possession of the Claret Jug. On that score at least he now sits 1-1 with McIlroy. There is a glaring dichotomy attached to Lowry\u2019s Open win, which came 48 hours after McIlroy missed the cut at a championship where he was in such sharp focus. McIlroy admitted as much, when posting praise of Lowry on Monday alongside a photo of the duo in their amateur days. \u201cEven though last week wasn\u2019t the week I had envisaged for myself, I couldn\u2019t be happier and more proud of Shane,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cHow he handled everything over the weekend \u2026 emotions, nerves and conditions tells you everything I\u2019ve gotten to know about him over the past 15 years. 2019 Champion Golfer of the Year!

That is what the police had asked me to do and it was the process I followed with all those who claimed to be survivors of historic child sex abuse.</p> <p>\u201cIt was not my role to judge whether victims\u2019 stories were true. I encouraged every person that came to me to take their story to the police and that is what I did with Nick. I hope this trial, and the case of one person, does not prevent survivors of child sexual abuse coming forward and reporting their experiences to the police.\u201d</p> <p>Responding to Proctor\u2019s criticisms, which included that of the Labour MP\u2019s speech to the Commons in 2012 in which he said there was \u201cclear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10\u201d, Watson said: \u201cI believe that my question to the prime minister in October 2012 surfaced the issue of historic child sexual abuse in a way that meant it could not be ignored as it had been. My question led to the recovery of police files and the conviction of three men for child sexual abuse.\u201d</p> <p>Beech alleged the offences had taken place in an array of locations in London \u2013 such as Dolphin Square, a private members\u2019 club, the Carlton Club, Elm Guest House and London zoo \u2013 as well as military bases and on Heath\u2019s yacht.</p> <p>Beech, who was a paediatric nurse at the start of his career, pleaded guilty in a separate trial in January to four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism.</p> <p>After Monday\u2019s verdict, the policing watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, announced it had cleared three officers involved in Operation Midland following an investigation into how a district judge granted police warrants to raid the homes of those Beech accused.</p> <p>Responding to Beech\u2019s conviction, the deputy Met commissioner, Sir Stephen House, said: \u201cIt remains true that investigating allegations of sexual offences is a very complex and challenging area of police work. Those complexities are compounded where those allegations stretch back many decades, as was the case in Operation Midland.</p> <p>\u201cAdditionally, many of the issues relating to the investigation of non-recent sexual offences continue to be examined by the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse, with which the Met is fully cooperating, and it would be inappropriate for us to pre-empt the inquiry\u2019s findings with any wider commentary on this area of policing at this time.\u201d</p>",

The trial heard that Beech fled to a remotepart of northern Sweden whenhis story began to unravel. His conviction comes as the Guardian can reveal: Beech gave talks to children as young as five about the dangers of abuse on behalf of the NSPCC. The journalist who led reporting of the false claims has admitted to repeated doubts about his key source and said he was taken in by Beech\u2019s middle-class credentials. Beech helped start a charity exhibition highlighting child abuse survivors\u2019 stories which went on display at City Hall in London. Beech \u2013 who pleaded guilty to child abuse image offences in a separate trial \u2013 told the Met in 2014 that his stepfather, Maj Raymond Beech, had begun ferrying him to parties when he was seven where he was sexually abused by a group of high-profile men.

Beech, who was a paediatric nurse at the start of his career, pleaded guilty in a separate trial in January to four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism. After Monday\u2019s verdict, the policing watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, announced it had cleared three officers involved in Operation Midland following an investigation into how a district judge granted police warrants to raid the homes of those Beech accused. Responding to Beech\u2019s conviction, the deputy Met commissioner, Sir Stephen House, said: \u201cIt remains true that investigating allegations of sexual offences is a very complex and challenging area of police work.

      "bodyText": "Appearing before Congress on Wednesday, former special counsel Robert Mueller will for the first time publicly detail ties between Donald Trump\u2019s campaign and Moscow and potential efforts by the president to obstruct justice in the Russia investigation. One Democrat on the House judiciary committee told the Guardian Mueller\u2019s testimony will prove \u201cdamning and explosive\u201d. The highly anticipated appearance is expected to reinvigorate heated debate among Democrats over whether Trump should be impeached. For Democrats who took control of the House in November, Mueller\u2019s remarks could prove a make-or-break moment as they grapple with how to hold the president accountable \u2013 and whether the public will be on their side if they move ahead with impeachment. \u201cWe cannot emphasize enough that this will be the first opportunity for many, many Americans to actually hear what\u2019s contained in the Mueller report,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House judiciary committee. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone should expect there\u2019s going to be an explosive new moment where [Mueller] is going to add something the investigation didn\u2019t cover, but the contents of the report are damning and explosive.\u201d Mueller will appear before the judiciary committee and the intelligence committee in what will be his first and only public assessment of his work before lawmakers on Capitol Hill. A redacted version of his 448-page report was released in April. The former FBI director made only a brief statement in May, reiterating his team\u2019s consensus that Trump could not be exonerated but also could not be charged with committing a crime. Mueller signaled a reluctance to testify, stating that his report should speak for itself. But his decision not to recommend charges against the president, choosing instead to punt the issue to a divided Congress, has left Democrats with little clarity on how to move forward. Roughly a third of House Democrats have called for a formal impeachment inquiry. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has cautioned against such a move, stating the ensuing fight would be \u201cdivisive\u201d and play into Trump\u2019s hands as he seeks re-election. Greg Brower, a former assistant director in the FBI\u2019s Office of Congressional Affairs, said Mueller\u2019s testimony could be \u201cvery impactful\u201d in shifting the political winds. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people or Congress fully understands what the evidence is,\u201d Brower said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of Mueller\u2019s continuing duty to explain his findings in as compelling a way as possible that, at a minimum, is intended to inform Congress, but could also change public opinion. \u201cJust assuming that nobody cares and it\u2019s not going to change any minds is an abdication of his responsibility to make sure the public understands the details of his report. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say it\u2019s Mueller\u2019s duty to advocate for a certain outcome.

Polling has found that the Mueller report did not substantially change public perceptions of the Russia investigation, although a slim majority would like to see some kind of action against the president. Just 39% believe no further action should be taken and investigations into Trump should end. All eyes are now on Mueller, with millions of Americans due to tune in from home. Republican members of the House committees have promised tough questioning, with supposed FBI misconduct around the Russia investigation, tweeted about by Trump on Monday, one likely subject. Trump himself suggested he had no plans to watch the hearing. \u201cMaybe I\u2019ll see a little bit of it,\u201d he told reporters at the White House, before swiftly reversing course. \u201cI\u2018m not going to be watching Mueller because you can\u2019t take all those bites out of the apple.

Ratcliffe\u2019s plans for the guardian\u2019s cottage also include a two-car garage and \u201ccart store\u201d for a further three cars, and an additional \u201cfour-bay machine store\u201d. There will also be a dovecote and a loggia, a reclaimed brick and wood structure designed to evoke the feeling of a Renaissance Italian palazzo. \u201cTwo additional small outbuildings give space for guardian to work and persue [sic] interests, the Loggia &amp; Dovecote, flanking the sides of the main dwelling,\u201d the application states. Ratcliffe submitted the plans for the cottage to \u201cprovide a family residence for a permanent guardian who will be responsible for tending to the site and neighbouring Thorns Beach House\u201d shortly after it was revealed that he plans to move to Monaco to save up to \u00a34bn-a-year in tax. In order to avoid paying UK taxes Ratcliffe will be limited to a maximum of 182 days a year in the UK and will not be able to visit his portfolio of British properties regularly. A team of six security guards are currently employed to guard the site of his main home in the picturesque village of Thorns Beach near Beaulieu. Ratcliffe has already annoyed his neigbours \u2013 who include the Dire Straits musicians Mark Knopfler and John Illsley \u2013 by requesting that they help fund his high-speed broadband connection. One neighbour told the Sun: \u201cHe\u2019s a bloody billionaire. If he wants it, why doesn\u2019t he just pay for it?\u201d Ratcliffe, who also owns a \u00a377m superyacht called Hampshire II, did not respond to requests for comment on the project. The Hampshire II, which has a crew of 21 and cabins for 14 guests, is currently in Monaco.",

Taylor was seeking state funding to set up five more centres to allow country students to study close to home. He later became chief executive of the CUC network.</p> <p>The documents show Country Universities Centre planned to pay the chief executive $170,000 a year. Duncan Taylor, who eventually took the job and stepped down as chair, has told the Guardian that he took the job on a voluntary basis and is not paid.</p> <p>The CUCs subsequently also received $5.1m funding in 2018 from the federal government, including $830,000 for a centre in Goulburn in the seat of Hume, the seat of the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor. Angus is the brother of Duncan, and Angus Taylor\u2019s wife, Louise Clegg, is on the board of the Goulburn CUC.</p> <p>A spokesman for Angus Taylor said he \u201chad no influence in the decision to award any of the grants to Country University Centres in NSW, including the Goulburn CUC\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Minister Taylor made no representations to the minister for education or his department.</p> <footer> <cite>Spokesman for Angus Taylor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cMinister Taylor made no representations to the minister for education or his department in relation to this matter.\u201d</p> <p>The 2016 cost-benefit analysis, which was done in a matter of days before Christmas by the industry department\u2019s investment appraisal unit, found the project\u2019s claims of benefit to the state due to increases in country students completing degrees were \u201cunrealistic\u201d.</p> <p>It said that completion rates would need to rise by 10.6% just to reach break even. But given the project was targeting part-time students whose completion rates were below 50%, this was \u201chighly optimistic\u201d.</p> <p>It concluded \u201cthat a cost benefit analysis using realistic student completion assumptions \u2026 is unlikely to find that the project would generate a positive net benefit to the state\u201d.</p> <p>It did note there could be equity reasons for funding the centres, as country students include larger numbers of poor and indigenous students.</p> <p>Highlighting the rushed nature of the project, the analysis noted it was done on \u201ca preliminary basis with insufficient time to conduct a full and rigorous cost benefit analysis\u201d. It said there had been much less testing of the information provided than was normal and there had not been time to conduct due diligence on the proposal.</p> <p>The documents also highlighted concerns the CUC proposal would duplicate Tafe. But this issue appears not to have been pursued in the face of the urgency to fund the program.</p> <p>The 2017-18 grant of $8m was made from unallocated funding within the industry department that was \u201crepurposed\u201d.

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales government funded a $16m education project closely associated with the spouse of a state minister despite a cost-benefit analysis showing the project would be unlikely to deliver a positive benefit to the state. The 2016 analysis of the proposed Country Universities Centres has surfaced after a call for papers by the NSW Legislative Council. The project was proposed by Duncan Taylor, husband of the upper house Nationals MP Bronwyn Taylor, who at the time was parliamentary secretary to John Barilaro, the state Nationals leader and deputy premier. The funding of the CUCs has led to fiery exchanges in question time and has been the subject of a parliamentary demand for documents following reporting on the project by Guardian Australia. The latest documents show Barilaro pushed for the Country Universities project to be funded even though the 2016 analysis found the proposal to set up five study centres in country NSW would not deliver value for money for the taxpayer. Bronwyn Taylor has said she played no role in securing the state funding for her husband\u2019s project. The documents confirm that the grants \u2013 $8m in 2017-18 and a further $8m in 2019 \u2013 were made without tender following a direct approach by Duncan Taylor to Barilaro. Barilaro, who has boasted that his nickname should be \u201cPork Barrelaro\u201d, and who is highly skilled in getting money for the regions, took an active role in funding the Country Universities Centres. One bureaucrat noted she was \u201cgetting pressure from Dep Prem office\u201d to get the CUC project funded, while several others noted the project was urgent. At the time Duncan Taylor was the chair of the Cooma Universities Centre, which had been established with support from Snowy Hydro. Taylor was seeking state funding to set up five more centres to allow country students to study close to home. He later became chief executive of the CUC network. The documents show Country Universities Centre planned to pay the chief executive $170,000 a year. Duncan Taylor, who eventually took the job and stepped down as chair, has told the Guardian that he took the job on a voluntary basis and is not paid. The CUCs subsequently also received $5.1m funding in 2018 from the federal government, including $830,000 for a centre in Goulburn in the seat of Hume, the seat of the federal energy minister, Angus Taylor. Angus is the brother of Duncan, and Angus Taylor\u2019s wife, Louise Clegg, is on the board of the Goulburn CUC. A spokesman for Angus Taylor said he \u201chad no influence in the decision to award any of the grants to Country University Centres in NSW, including the Goulburn CUC\u201d. \u201cMinister Taylor made no representations to the minister for education or his department in relation to this matter.\u201d The 2016 cost-benefit analysis, which was done in a matter of days before Christmas by the industry department\u2019s investment appraisal unit, found the project\u2019s claims of benefit to the state due to increases in country students completing degrees were \u201cunrealistic\u201d. It said that completion rates would need to rise by 10.6% just to reach break even. But given the project was targeting part-time students whose completion rates were below 50%, this was \u201chighly optimistic\u201d. It concluded \u201cthat a cost benefit analysis using realistic student completion assumptions \u2026 is unlikely to find that the project would generate a positive net benefit to the state\u201d. It did note there could be equity reasons for funding the centres, as country students include larger numbers of poor and indigenous students. Highlighting the rushed nature of the project, the analysis noted it was done on \u201ca preliminary basis with insufficient time to conduct a full and rigorous cost benefit analysis\u201d. It said there had been much less testing of the information provided than was normal and there had not been time to conduct due diligence on the proposal. The documents also highlighted concerns the CUC proposal would duplicate Tafe. But this issue appears not to have been pursued in the face of the urgency to fund the program. The 2017-18 grant of $8m was made from unallocated funding within the industry department that was \u201crepurposed\u201d. Barilaro announced the initiative at a Young Nationals conference in April 2017. In one email, bureaucrats discuss whether the matter needs to go to cabinet or go through the expenditure review process. \u201cAs discussed, I expect it is the DP\u2019s [deputy premier\u2019s] call as to how he would like to proceed, but if there are rules or expectations to follow then we should advise him of that in the brief,\u201d one bureaucrat said. In February this year, the second grant of $8m was being considered by Barilaro\u2019s department to open CUCs in Mudgee, Tumut, Deniliquin, Young and Parkes. A briefing document shows the departmental secretary directed his department \u201cto examine whether there is a basis for direct negotiation with CUC\u201d. The memo notes that direct negotiation is generally not advised but could be justified if the project demonstrates \u201cuniqueness\u201d. While grants are not subject to the procurement rules, the memo noted that \u201ccare must be taken to adhere to the Independent Commission against Corruption guidelines which state: \u2018as a general rule, direct negotiations should be avoided unless they clearly fall within the the government\u2019s legislative and policy framework and/or the risk of corrupt conduct has been managed in accordance with these guidelines\u2019.\u201d The second $8m grant was announced by Barilaro in February 2019, just before the state election. It is unclear from the documents whether the project went to cabinet. A spokesman for Barilaro said: \u201cThe NSW Government followed all procedures as recommended and approved by the NSW Department of Industry.\u201d The shadow treasurer, Walt Secord, said the documents prove that no due diligence was undertaken. \u201cIn short, these documents show that the Berejiklian government should have not funded the project,\u201d Secord said. \u201cWith the release of these documents, the Berejiklian government has many questions to answer including why they funded this project when the advice warned against it.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The return to strong wage rises still looks to be some way off as the latest labour force figures offer only the smallest of hopes that underemployment is falling. Overall there continues to be a high level of spare capacity in the labour market. With the recent move of the Australian Bureau of Statistics to detail underemployment rates each month, we now can give it as much attention as the unemployment rate. But while this increased focus is very good given the importance underemployment has on wages growth, and also for highlighting the overall health of the economy, it also means we need to be careful in not getting too excited by its monthly changes. Last week the latest labour force figures showed the underemployment rate fell 0.4% points \u2013 the second biggest monthly fall for over four years \u2013 to a rate of 8.2%. This clearly is good news. A lower underemployment rate means fewer people are unhappy with the amount of hours they are working, and as a result people are less worried about the trade-off between more hours and better pay. But alas that big fall was in the seasonally adjusted rate; the less erratic trend rate saw no change \u2013 indeed it has been at 8.3% for 10 straight months: The seasonally adjusted rate jumps around a fair bit \u2013 even more so than the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate. Over the past five years the median change in the underemployment rate has been 0.14% points compared with just 0.07% points for unemployment. So it pays not to get too excited by a one-month change, but this is the case even more so in the latest month. When we look at the actual number of underemployed workers we see that in June there was a 4.2% fall \u2013 the biggest one-month fall since October 2014 and the second biggest fall for over 18 years: Now that alone would have you questioning if it is more of a statistical flub than a reflection of reality, but just how wonky the figure is becomes even more clear when you break it down by states. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the number of underemployed workers in June fell across the nation by 49,000; but in Victoria alone the number fell by 53,600. The 15.9% fall in Victorian underemployment was the biggest one-month fall in the state since 1988 and the second biggest fall in any mainland state for 30 years. Underemployment actually rose by 0.6% elsewhere in the nation: It looks like the big fall in June was mostly a statistical response to the big rise in May \u2013 in effect it was all a bit of noise. So where does that leave us? Well, because the underemployment rate has remained flat in trend terms over the past six months while the unemployment rate has risen, it means that there has been a slight narrowing of the two measures \u2013 although they remain much further apart than they once were: But the rise in unemployment this year also means that underutilisation has increased \u2013 and increased mostly across all ages: And with that increase comes the slackening of the labour market \u2013 more people wanting either more hours or any work at all. And when that occurs, the pressure for wages growth eases. Given there was not much to begin with, that rather dashes any hopes that the slight improvement in wages growth that has occurred over the past year might continue. And so in lieu of a wage rise the best we can hope for is more interest rate cuts. Over the past two months there has been a large change in the outlook for rates. In May, the outlook was for the cash rate to get to the current level of 1.0% only by the end of the year; now the expectation is for the cash rate to reach 0.75% by then and around a 50% chance of a further cut to 0.5% by this time next year: But as Shane Wright in the Sydney Morning Herald has noted, those rate cuts are not going to help wages growth, especially while the number of unemployed and underemployed per job vacancy is rising: The big statistical drop in underemployment in June could be a sign of a corner being turned and that things are about to improve, but this is a small hope as a more realistic view of the figures is that it was just a statistical flub in one state. For workers the problem is that the period of falling underutilisation that occurred during 2017 and 2018 looks to have at best slowed and at worst halted completely. And given that even during these two improving years wages growth remained pitiful, there seems little hope that things will get better any time soon. \u2022 Greg Jericho is a Guardian Australia columnist",

      "bodyText": "\u201cFor many unemployed people, Australia not only doesn\u2019t have one of the best safety nets in the world, it has one of the worst.\u201d That\u2019s the finding of an analysis of Newstart by the Australian National University\u2019s Prof Peter Whiteford \u2013 and comes despite Scott Morrison\u2019s claim in May that Australia\u2019s safety net is a world-beater. There appears to be more momentum now for an increase to Newstart, Australia\u2019s $277.85-a-week unemployment benefit, than there has been for quite some time. Guardian Australia has assessed some of the claims around Newstart previously, such as the tricky suggestion that 99% of Newstart recipients get other payments. But there is still more to say. So consider this, Newstart facts, part two. How does Newstart compare to the rest of the world? Whiteford\u2019s analysis, which first appeared in a piece for Inside Story, used OECD data to compare Australia\u2019s unemployment benefit against other nations. Most other OECD countries have an insurance system in which people\u2019s benefits are paid as a percentage of their last wage, while Australia\u2019s payment is a set rate. Whiteford took the \u201creplacement rate\u201d of each country and, using an Australian who had lost a salary that was two-thirds of the average wage, found that Newstart was the second-lowest payment in the OECD. When he included rent assistance, which about 40% of people on Newstart get, compared to other nation\u2019s housing benefits, Newstart is \u201cthe lowest payment in the OECD\u201d. A department spokeswoman noted that other OECD nations measured eligibility \u201cbased on past income, contributions or taxes paid during a person\u2019s working life\u201d. \u201cIn many overseas countries eligibility and rates of payment are determined by how much an individual has contributed to an insurance-based arrangement while working,\u201d the spokeswoman said. \u201cIn a number of instances these payments are also time-limited. \u201cAustralia\u2019s payments continue until an unemployed person finds a job unlike a number of OECD countries where the assistance a person receives can reduce or stop even though they remain unemployed.\u201d Even taking someone who had been on Newstart for five years, Whiteford found Australia was still \u201cbelow the OECD average\u201d and behind countries such as New Zealand, France, Germany and the UK. How long do people stay on Newstart? If you\u2019ve been following the debate around Newstart at all, you might be wondering how two-thirds of people can move off Newstart in less than 12 months, as the government says, while 64% are on it longer than a year, as welfare groups point out. The difference is in two data tables prepared every three months by the Department of Social Services. Or, as Whiteford puts it, the difference between \u201cstock and flow\u201d. The one the government cites takes all the people who have gotten onto the Newstart payment between January-December 2017. It then counts how many have exited the payment within 12 months. Of the 376,031 \u201centries\u201d, there were 226,530 \u201cexits\u201d, or 63%. The other data table takes all Newstart recipients on the government\u2019s books at a point-in-time, say December last year, and measures how long they have been on the payment. Crucially, that measure takes in people who have been on the payment much longer, even as long as five or 10 years. That table is reproduced below.

In 1997, the Howard government effectively froze Newstart, tying it to inflation while the pension is pegged to wages. (Howard has since said it\u2019s time to increase Newstart.) That has resulted in six-month increases such as the $2.35 a week extra delivered last year to Newstart recipients like Kylie Ruxton, who labelled it \u201claughable\u201d.

While the increases for politicians have mostly been in line with wages (starting from a much higher base), in 2012 MPs and senators got a $50,000 yearly pay bump. Newstart was 10.8% of a politician\u2019s salary in 1994, and it is now 6.85%. Between 1994 and today, while Newstart increases have been pegged to inflation, a federal politician\u2019s base salary has increased by $85,776.37 in real terms.",

      "body": "<p>One thing as predictable as an increase in the projected cost of building HS2 is the response from business lobby groups. Sure enough, as the high-speed railway <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/20/hs2-could-go-30bn-over-budget\">was reported last week</a> to be hurtling towards a potential cost overrun of almost \u00a330bn, trade bodies barely paused to consider this astonishing figure and instead insisted that HS2 should be built anyway.</p> <p>To be scrupulously accurate, the CBI nodded to the idea that \u201ctaxpayers\u2019 money should always be spent wisely\u201d and that HS2 should \u201cstrive\u201d to stay on budget. And the British Chambers of Commerce opined that \u201cno public project should be written a blank cheque\u201d, a notably abstract form of words.</p> <p>But both organisations then returned to trumpeting the supposed wondrous benefits of the rail link for jobs, connectivity and economic growth. Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn wants the new prime minister to make \u201ca clear re-commitment\u201d to HS2 with \u201cno equivocation\u201d. Claire Walker, co-executive director of the BCC, also wants him to lash himself to the rails. The government \u201cmust reaffirm its commitment to the delivery of HS2\u201d, she declared.</p> <p>Is this how the CBI and the BCC think their members run their own businesses? Do they think boards routinely make binding pledges to build, say, a new factory even if the costs of construction have exploded? Do they believe an extra \u00a330bn for HS2 doesn\u2019t matter?</p> <p>Once upon a time, the rail link was meant to cost \u00a332bn in its entirety. In 2012, that became \u00a342bn. Then \u00a356bn. Now, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/27ab2f5c-a976-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04\">according to the FT</a>, Allan Cook, the new chairman of HS2, has written to the Department for Transport to say the final costs could be between \u00a370bn and \u00a385bn.</p> <p>If private money were at stake, rather than public funds, one can imagine how the conversation in the boardroom would go. There would be a rigorous re-examination of costs and benefits. The directors would ask if there are better ways to deliver \u201ca catalyst for economic growth\u201d, to use HS2\u2019s language. Would up-grading commuter and regional routes, or speeding up travel within Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, deliver more bang for the same buck?</p> <p>The commercial question would be framed this way: at what point does HS2 become so expensive that alternative infrastructure investments deliver better value?</p> <p>If the CBI, the BCC and other fans of HS2 mean what they say about \u201cno blank cheque\u201d they should volunteer an answer. If their support is truly conditional on cost, how much is too much? Does \u00a370bn-\u00a385bn qualify? If not, is \u00a3100bn also acceptable? More?</p> <p>Strange as it sounds given Boris Johnson\u2019s previous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/29/matt-hancock-lays-into-boris-johnson-over-brexit-business-f-word-tirade\">\u201cfuck business\u201d remark</a>, the new prime minister sounds more businesslike than the business folk on the subject of HS2. Unlike the lobbyists, he\u2019s at least asking about money.

      "bodyText": "One thing as predictable as an increase in the projected cost of building HS2 is the response from business lobby groups. Sure enough, as the high-speed railway was reported last week to be hurtling towards a potential cost overrun of almost \u00a330bn, trade bodies barely paused to consider this astonishing figure and instead insisted that HS2 should be built anyway. To be scrupulously accurate, the CBI nodded to the idea that \u201ctaxpayers\u2019 money should always be spent wisely\u201d and that HS2 should \u201cstrive\u201d to stay on budget. And the British Chambers of Commerce opined that \u201cno public project should be written a blank cheque\u201d, a notably abstract form of words. But both organisations then returned to trumpeting the supposed wondrous benefits of the rail link for jobs, connectivity and economic growth. Director-general Carolyn Fairbairn wants the new prime minister to make \u201ca clear re-commitment\u201d to HS2 with \u201cno equivocation\u201d. Claire Walker, co-executive director of the BCC, also wants him to lash himself to the rails. The government \u201cmust reaffirm its commitment to the delivery of HS2\u201d, she declared. Is this how the CBI and the BCC think their members run their own businesses? Do they think boards routinely make binding pledges to build, say, a new factory even if the costs of construction have exploded? Do they believe an extra \u00a330bn for HS2 doesn\u2019t matter? Once upon a time, the rail link was meant to cost \u00a332bn in its entirety. In 2012, that became \u00a342bn. Then \u00a356bn. Now, according to the FT, Allan Cook, the new chairman of HS2, has written to the Department for Transport to say the final costs could be between \u00a370bn and \u00a385bn. If private money were at stake, rather than public funds, one can imagine how the conversation in the boardroom would go. There would be a rigorous re-examination of costs and benefits. The directors would ask if there are better ways to deliver \u201ca catalyst for economic growth\u201d, to use HS2\u2019s language. Would up-grading commuter and regional routes, or speeding up travel within Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester, deliver more bang for the same buck? The commercial question would be framed this way: at what point does HS2 become so expensive that alternative infrastructure investments deliver better value? If the CBI, the BCC and other fans of HS2 mean what they say about \u201cno blank cheque\u201d they should volunteer an answer. If their support is truly conditional on cost, how much is too much? Does \u00a370bn-\u00a385bn qualify? If not, is \u00a3100bn also acceptable? More? Strange as it sounds given Boris Johnson\u2019s previous \u201cfuck business\u201d remark, the new prime minister sounds more businesslike than the business folk on the subject of HS2. Unlike the lobbyists, he\u2019s at least asking about money. He has been critical of spiralling costs and has commissioned Douglas Oakervee, a former HS2 chairman, to conduct an independent review. There\u2019s no guarantee that Johnson would change direction in office, but a call for facts and analysis is surely justified. On its current trajectory, HS2 is a financial monster that will consume the lion\u2019s share of government spending on rail for years. The CBI\u2019s call for no equivocation flies in the face of the business world\u2019s usual demand for government to engage in evidence-based decision-making. If the costs of HS2 could be almost two and half times the original estimate, equivocation is far more sensible than a rigid refusal to look at the numbers. Bring Star back to Earth Expect craziness, warned China experts, and they were right. The launch in Shanghai of Star Market, a new Nasdaq-style stock exchange, was accompanied by wild speculation. Every stock surged in value and one, chipmaker Anji Microelectronics Technology, rose by 520% from its float price. Nasdaq, lest we forget, has not always been immune to irrational exuberance \u2013 think the dotcom bubble, circa 1999. But the Chinese authorities, if they\u2019re serious about creating a respected market for domestic technology firms, would be well advised to try to calm proceedings. China has been down this Nasdaq-style route in the past with an exchange called ChiNext, which is still going but seems to have been tarnished by corporate scandals among listed firms. Star Market, with the promise of higher governance standards, is intended to be an improvement.

      "body": "<p>John Gosden has said that Enable faces \u201ca tall order\u201d in trying to win Saturday\u2019s King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, despite being a hot favourite in the betting. The trainer accused bookmakers of trying to protect themselves by offering unrealistically short odds about his mare, who is unbeaten since April 2017.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/21/andrea-atzeni-enable-king-george-ascot-frankie-dettori-defoe\">Andrea Atzeni hoping to lower Enable\u2019s colours in King George</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cI see the betting industry has put her at a price that they don\u2019t want anyone to be backing her,\u201d Gosden said of Enable, a 4-6 shot for Saturday. He thinks that this is partly a consequence of her jockey, Frankie Dettori, winning four races on a single day at Royal Ascot last month, when bookmakers lost heavily to punters backing his mounts in accumulators. It could have been still more expensive for bookies, had Dettori won the Britannia on Turgenev, as briefly seemed likely.</p> \n<p>\u201cI was told that if Frankie hadn\u2019t got carried away down at the two and a half furlong marker in the Britannia that day, we could have had a couple of institutions with rather a large hole under the waterline,\u201d Gosden added. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure that pricing her where she is, is not realistic to her chances. But it is realistic for them trying to protect themselves, I suppose. I see here more as an even-money shot, with the quality of that field.\u201d</p> \n<p>Enable won the King George two years ago but Gosden explained why she faces a stiffer task this time. \u201cShe won it as a three-year-old filly, getting the weight from the others, just as Taghrooda won it as a three-year-old filly. It\u2019s a little different when you\u2019re older and suddenly you\u2019ve got a Derby winner coming at you and he\u2019s getting the weight from you. And you have a wonderful old horse, Crystal Ocean, who ran a blinder in it last year and won the Prince of Wales well. So this is no penalty kick, absolutely not.\u201d</p> \n<p>But he added that everything had gone smoothly for Enable in the three weeks since she made an impressive comeback success in the Eclipse. And he is pleased by Dettori\u2019s continued excellent form.</p> \n<p>\u201cI suppose, like Lewis Hamilton, you get in the zone and you get your confidence, you\u2019re not frightened of anything. It doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not a banana skin around every corner. But having said that, he is riding well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Referring to Dettori\u2019s front-running tactics that sealed victory in Saturday\u2019s Irish Oaks on Star Catcher, Gosden said: \u201cHe was concerned that they might go forward and then pull the pace up. We discussed it before and I said, \u2018You know, with me, you\u2019ve got a blank canvas, you paint the painting any way you want.\u2019 And he went out there and thought, no, I\u2019m not happy with what\u2019s happening here, I\u2019m going to set my own fractions.\u201d</p> \n<p>Reflecting on a productive year so far, Gosden spoke of his pleasure at sending out \u201csix individual Group One winners for six different owner-breeders\u201d. He now has an exceptionally strong hand for major races to come.</p> \n<p>Too Darn Hot will tackle the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood next week, with his trainer hoping to avoid a wide draw. Stradivarius will also be there, trying to win a third consecutive Goodwood Cup, while Mehdaayih goes for the Nassau.</p> \n<p>Anapurna is heading for next month\u2019s Yorkshire Oaks, where she could be joined by Coronet and/or Lah Ti Dar. That race remains a possibility for Enable, though she has an alternative in the Juddmonte International.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"3a66744c-ed0b-4824-98a8-d036cbb62350\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Musselburgh</b>&nbsp;<br><b>2.00</b> Arriba De Toda <b>2.30</b> Northern Hope <b>3.00</b> Spirit Of Lund <b>3.30</b> Tom&nbsp;<br>Tulliver <b>4.00</b> Classic Pursuit <b>4.30</b> Iolani <b>5.00</b> Your Pal Tal (nb)&nbsp;<br><b>Wolverhampton</b>&nbsp;<br><b>2.15</b> Prissy Missy <b>2.45</b> X Force <b>3.15</b> Wild Edric <b>3.45</b> Deleyll <b>4.15</b> Engrossed&nbsp;<b>4.45</b> Stormbomber <b>5.15</b> Genuine Approval&nbsp;<br><b>Chelmsford</b>&nbsp;<br><b>5.20</b> Farol <b>5.50</b> Hector Loza <b>6.20</b> Alkaraama (nap) <b>6.50</b> Lawmaking <b>7.20</b> Lady Lawyer <b>7.50</b> Maximum Effect <b>8.20</b> Characteristic <b>8.50</b> Threshodofadream&nbsp;<br><b>Southwell</b>&nbsp;<br><b>5.40</b> Streets Of Milan <b>6.10</b> Le Musee <b>6.40</b> Red Inca <b>7.10</b> Skeaping <b>7.40</b> Carrie&nbsp;Des Champs <b>8.10</b> Red Royalist <b>8.40</b> Theatre Act&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>King Of Comedy, runner-up at Royal Ascot, will go to France for the Jacques le Marois, with the Irish Champion and the Champion Stakes as longer-term targets.

      "bodyText": "John Gosden has said that Enable faces \u201ca tall order\u201d in trying to win Saturday\u2019s King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, despite being a hot favourite in the betting. The trainer accused bookmakers of trying to protect themselves by offering unrealistically short odds about his mare, who is unbeaten since April 2017. \u201cI see the betting industry has put her at a price that they don\u2019t want anyone to be backing her,\u201d Gosden said of Enable, a 4-6 shot for Saturday. He thinks that this is partly a consequence of her jockey, Frankie Dettori, winning four races on a single day at Royal Ascot last month, when bookmakers lost heavily to punters backing his mounts in accumulators. It could have been still more expensive for bookies, had Dettori won the Britannia on Turgenev, as briefly seemed likely. \u201cI was told that if Frankie hadn\u2019t got carried away down at the two and a half furlong marker in the Britannia that day, we could have had a couple of institutions with rather a large hole under the waterline,\u201d Gosden added. \u201cSo I\u2019m sure that pricing her where she is, is not realistic to her chances. But it is realistic for them trying to protect themselves, I suppose. I see here more as an even-money shot, with the quality of that field.\u201d Enable won the King George two years ago but Gosden explained why she faces a stiffer task this time. \u201cShe won it as a three-year-old filly, getting the weight from the others, just as Taghrooda won it as a three-year-old filly. It\u2019s a little different when you\u2019re older and suddenly you\u2019ve got a Derby winner coming at you and he\u2019s getting the weight from you. And you have a wonderful old horse, Crystal Ocean, who ran a blinder in it last year and won the Prince of Wales well. So this is no penalty kick, absolutely not.\u201d But he added that everything had gone smoothly for Enable in the three weeks since she made an impressive comeback success in the Eclipse. And he is pleased by Dettori\u2019s continued excellent form. \u201cI suppose, like Lewis Hamilton, you get in the zone and you get your confidence, you\u2019re not frightened of anything. It doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s not a banana skin around every corner. But having said that, he is riding well.\u201d Referring to Dettori\u2019s front-running tactics that sealed victory in Saturday\u2019s Irish Oaks on Star Catcher, Gosden said: \u201cHe was concerned that they might go forward and then pull the pace up. We discussed it before and I said, \u2018You know, with me, you\u2019ve got a blank canvas, you paint the painting any way you want.\u2019 And he went out there and thought, no, I\u2019m not happy with what\u2019s happening here, I\u2019m going to set my own fractions.\u201d Reflecting on a productive year so far, Gosden spoke of his pleasure at sending out \u201csix individual Group One winners for six different owner-breeders\u201d. He now has an exceptionally strong hand for major races to come. Too Darn Hot will tackle the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood next week, with his trainer hoping to avoid a wide draw. Stradivarius will also be there, trying to win a third consecutive Goodwood Cup, while Mehdaayih goes for the Nassau. Anapurna is heading for next month\u2019s Yorkshire Oaks, where she could be joined by Coronet and/or Lah Ti Dar. That race remains a possibility for Enable, though she has an alternative in the Juddmonte International. King Of Comedy, runner-up at Royal Ascot, will go to France for the Jacques le Marois, with the Irish Champion and the Champion Stakes as longer-term targets. Star Catcher, the Irish Oaks winner, also has a French target in the Prix Vermeille. It was reported later on Monday that Sea Of Class had died, having failed to recover from a bout of colic and consequent surgery in recent weeks. William Haggas\u2019s chestnut filly won the Irish Oaks and the Yorkshire Oaks last year and was widely seen as unlucky when narrowly beaten by Enable in the Arc.",

But a newfound unity on Brexit, as well as the fresh action on antisemitism, appear to make that unlikely.</p> <p>However, the Labour leader faced some rearguard action in the meeting from shadow ministers who wanted to beef-up independent involvement in the complaints process, which was not part of Corbyn\u2019s original proposal.</p> <p>In a joint statement, the shadow cabinet backed Corbyn\u2019s plan but said it also \u201csupports the proposal to introduce independent oversight of our processes\u201d. Corbyn is likely to suggest that could include independent legal advice \u2013 stopping short of outsourcing the process entirely.</p> <p>At the meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, Corbyn faced an hour of strained questioning from MPs. \u201cIt was one of the most tense it has been,\u201d one MP said. \u201cThe trust has just gone. And this happens every week.\u201d</p> <p>MPs said Cooper had berated the Labour leader for the treatment of whistleblowers who spoke to BBC Panorama\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">documentary about the crisis</a>, saying they had been smeared and that treated incited more members to verbally attack MPs locally.</p> <p>Kyle reeled off a list of antisemitic incidents in his Hove constituency, including a member who had proposed a protest march against the local synagogue. \u201cHe asked [Corbyn] to consider what it is about his world view \u2013 separate from a political platform \u2013 that has attracted these people into our party in the first place,\u201d one MP said.</p> <p>The Jewish Labour Movement also expressed scepticism of the new plan and said it would be handing power to another factional body. \u201cThe national executive committee (NEC) is elected on factional slates on the basis of political patronage.

      "bodyText": "Jeremy Corbyn has set out new plans to ramp up the expulsion of antisemites from the Labour party at an emergency shadow cabinet meeting, though MPs later angrily questioned why the proposal did not have detail on independent oversight as demanded by senior MPs. The proposals, which were backed by the shadow cabinet, came before a restive meeting of MPs on Monday night, where MPs including Yvette Cooper and Peter Kyle called on the Labour leader to reflect on why antisemites might be attracted to join the party. Corbyn told the shadow cabinet before a crunch meeting of the party\u2019s ruling body on Tuesday that a new rule would refer members who had clearly committed the most egregious offences to a new panel of officials, including the general secretary, with the power to immediately expel them. Presenting the proposals, Corbyn had the backing of key allies including shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who has at times in recent weeks appeared frustrated at the handling of the issue. Some of Corbyn\u2019s supporters regard antisemitism as a \u201cwedge\u201d issue used to undermine him, and had begun to fear an imminent leadership challenge. But a newfound unity on Brexit, as well as the fresh action on antisemitism, appear to make that unlikely. However, the Labour leader faced some rearguard action in the meeting from shadow ministers who wanted to beef-up independent involvement in the complaints process, which was not part of Corbyn\u2019s original proposal. In a joint statement, the shadow cabinet backed Corbyn\u2019s plan but said it also \u201csupports the proposal to introduce independent oversight of our processes\u201d. Corbyn is likely to suggest that could include independent legal advice \u2013 stopping short of outsourcing the process entirely. At the meeting of Labour MPs on Monday night, Corbyn faced an hour of strained questioning from MPs. \u201cIt was one of the most tense it has been,\u201d one MP said. \u201cThe trust has just gone. And this happens every week.\u201d MPs said Cooper had berated the Labour leader for the treatment of whistleblowers who spoke to BBC Panorama\u2019s documentary about the crisis, saying they had been smeared and that treated incited more members to verbally attack MPs locally. Kyle reeled off a list of antisemitic incidents in his Hove constituency, including a member who had proposed a protest march against the local synagogue. \u201cHe asked [Corbyn] to consider what it is about his world view \u2013 separate from a political platform \u2013 that has attracted these people into our party in the first place,\u201d one MP said. The Jewish Labour Movement also expressed scepticism of the new plan and said it would be handing power to another factional body. \u201cThe national executive committee (NEC) is elected on factional slates on the basis of political patronage. It has an in-built majority for the left which does what the leadership of the party tells it to,\u201d JLM\u2019s chair, Mike Katz, said. \u201cNothing short of a fully independent process, first asked for by the Jewish community way back in April 2018, is even going to begin to suggest that the party leadership really cares about tackling institutional anti-Jewish racism.\u201d Labour released new figures on Monday, briefed by the general secretary, Jennie Formby, to the shadow cabinet, revealing it had referred 97 members to the national constitutional committee (NCC), the party\u2019s highest disciplinary body, for possible expulsion since January, with an additional 41 given warnings and 49 given reminders of conduct. The party said there had been complaints against 625 Labour members, some receiving multiple complaints, but the party had also received complaints about 658 people who were not current members. However, the figures also suggested that just 28 of those cases had been dealt with by the NCC, resulting in eight expulsions, three suspensions, four warnings and one not guilty finding. Twelve of those referred to the NCC had left the party of their own accord. The equivalent period in 2018 saw just 10 cases heard and seven expulsions \u2013 just one fewer than the current year. Speaking in shadow cabinet, Corbyn said complaints had often taken too long to deal with. \u201cThis is not good enough,\u201d he said. \u201cOur members don\u2019t want to share their party with anyone who is racist \u2013 and they want to be able to demonstrate there is no place for antisemitism among them. \u201cSome of the hate and bigotry displayed on social media would count as gross misconduct in any workplace and must be treated similarly robustly in the Labour party.\u201d Several NEC members, including the party\u2019s deputy leader Tom Watson, proposed changes last week to install an independent appointee with the power to automatically expel members for racism, antisemitism, homophobia, sexism or transphobia. The change proposed by Corbyn on Monday would not give that independent oversight but would cut out the need to refer members to the NCC where hearings can take months, sometimes years, to take place. A Labour source said there were significant obstacles to fully outsourcing the disciplinary process. \u201cNo other political party or trade union has outsourced its complaints process,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt is unclear how it could logistically work and comply with our responsibilities under data protection legislation..\u201d Corbyn\u2019s preferred plan would mean those offences that met the criteria would instead be referred swiftly to a special panel including the general secretary and NEC officers \u2013 its most senior officials.

Assad, though nominally in a winning position, owes his ascendancy to Moscow and Tehran, both of whom have been staking out their claims on postwar Syria as the war has slowly wound down. Iran, which provided proxy ground forces that were instrumental in the recapture of Aleppo in late 2016, has not committed substantial forces to the Idlib front, and is increasingly at odds with Moscow over how to deal with the province. Turkey, while acquiescing to a limited Russian-led operation in the south of Idlib province, has insisted it would not shoulder the burden of a massive inflow of refugees in the event of a coordinated ground push. Its calls for a fresh summit add weight to assessments in the region and Europe that the battlefront has reached a stalemate. \u201cWe say to Assad and his friends that their obvious attempts to obliterate civilian life have failed this far and will fail again,\u201d said a senior Turkish official. \u201cThey have lost in Idlib, and will continue to lose. They cannot bomb their way into victory. Only infamy.\u201d",

Jane\u2019s other major contribution to world archaeology was to highlight the treatment of human remains and the broader repatriation issue, in books she co-edited, Sacred Sites, Sacred Places (1994) and The Dead and Their Possessions (2002). Born in Chelsea, London, Jane was the youngest of three daughters of William de Bargue Hubert, a psychiatrist, and his wife, Ruth (nee Kindersley), both of whom died while Jane was a teenager.

In 1974 Anthony became professor of anthropology at the Australian National University and shortly afterwards Jane joined the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1982. Jane had returned to the UK the previous year and taken up a post with the healthcare evaluation team in community medicine at Southampton University, where her new partner, Peter Ucko, was professor of archaeology. She brought a unique anthropological perspective to learning disability research, and obtained funding for a study of 20 families who had a child or young adult at home with a profound learning disability and challenging behaviour. A similar study followed with 20 families with a child at home with a severe head injury, leading to her 1995 book Life After Head Injury. Jane and Peter became involved in the decision to uphold the UN\u2019s academic and cultural boycott of South Africa by banning participants from South Africa and Namibia (then under apartheid South African control) from the meeting of the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (UISPP) in 1986, which Peter was organising. Rather surprisingly, as the UISPP was affiliated to the UN through Unesco, its executive ruled that it was unconstitutional to exclude any scholars, and withdrew the conference. In response, a new organising committee, led by Peter, set up the World Archeological Congress, and invited people from new nations and minority groups. This caused a schism in academic archaeology.

However, while Peter was credited, or attacked, for the ban and the revolution in the study and practice of archaeology, WAC simply would not have happened without her. She provided the insight and understanding of a close academic, political and ethical collaborator. WAC, now the primary international archaeological organisation, is as much Jane\u2019s legacy as Peter\u2019s. She continued her medically related work at Southampton and confronted common practice in Too Many Drugs, Too Little Care (1992), about the inappropriate use of psychotropic medication to treat people with learning disabilities. The book was the topic of a BBC Panorama programme in 1992 and prompted one reviewer, Jean O\u2019Hara, in the Psychiatric Bulletin, to comment \u201cread this book, and you will appreciate the magnitude of the problem, and the need for a radical shift in social and professional attitudes\u201d. In 1993 Jane joined the department of psychiatry of disability at St George\u2019s hospital, Tooting, in south London, where she continued to introduce and supervise ethnographic research methods that were deeply rooted in social justice.

Jane merged her academic worlds by involving a number of learning disabilities experts in the fourth WAC held in post-apartheid Cape Town in 1999, which resulted in another groundbreaking volume, Madness, Disability and Social Exclusion: The Archaeology and Anthropology of \u201cDifference\u201d (2000). In retirement, Jane continued to work as an honorary senior lecturer at St George\u2019s, and collated eight of her best publications for a doctoral thesis, The Realities of Life for People with Severe and Profound Disabilities and Mental Health Problems, awarded in 2009 by Maastricht University. In 2012 she was presented with a lifetime achievement award by WAC. Peter died in 2007. Jane is survived by Tom and Olivia, her grandchildren, Jess, Toby and Barnaby, and her sister Anna. \u2022 Jane Hubert, anthropologist and health researcher, born 16 March 1935; died 21 June 2019",

Dyche is telling us that if a player told him he was gay, neither he nor anyone else in the dressing room would have any issue with it. \u201cDoes being gay mean you can\u2019t be a good footballer?\u201d he would say. \u201cNo. So let\u2019s crack on.\u201d</p> <p>So what does it say about the culture of homophobia in football, Grace wants to know, that no current players in the English men\u2019s game have come out as gay? There must be gay footballers, she says \u2013 he nods \u2013 but we don\u2019t have any idea. \u201cHold on though,\u201d he says. \u201cHave you ever thought they might not want you to have any idea? This thing about \u2018the next gay footballer\u2019. Imagine the noise around that. They might not want it. You could not contain that information. All I am saying is that in my changing room, there would be no problem.\u201d</p> <p>We ask all our interviewees to mark themselves out of 10, both as football fans and as feminists. On feminism, he marks himself down, saying he is probably \u201caround three, four out of 10\u201d, though Grace marks him up as the conversation develops as he talks about his mother, his wife and his teenage daughter in terms which make her think he understands equality, but perhaps doesn\u2019t understand that equality is all feminism is really about. \u201cI grew up in an era where Dad worked, Mum looked after the family, and if I think of the qualities she brought to that \u2013 nurture and support are so valuable. She didn\u2019t have a powerful job, but she was very powerful in my house, as powerful as any position anyone can hold in a business. You cannot underestimate the importance of that role in a home.\u201d</p> <p>His wife Jane, he says, is also \u201cwhat you would call a housewife\u201d, but cultural and social changes mean she does it differently to the last generation. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a job but she teaches disabled children tennis, and in the last six and a half years I\u2019ve lived two lives, working in Burnley, a lot of time up there, and Jane has been here with the children much more. She has done a remarkable job \u2013 I should tell her more. She is her own woman, she is bright, has a degree, but her thirst is not a career but to be the modern version of a housewife, not cooking and cleaning the whole time, but making sure everything here is ticking over and the kids are OK \u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Most people think footballers are thick. Some might be academically, but they can see the game strategically, tactically</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about education. We are more educated. I am still learning. I am in a male-dominated world.\u201d</p> <p>Male-dominated or not, it is a world in which the modern manager must pay attention to the emotional needs of players in a way that makes his time as a player seem like a different age. Though he speaks with fondness bordering on reverence of Brian Clough, manager at Nottingham Forest when Dyche was a young apprentice, he describes his man management as \u201cbrutal\u201d. \u201cIt was basically \u2018do it, or disappear\u2019. If he told you you played well, your head grew so big you couldn\u2019t get through the door. If he said you played badly, you wanted to disappear under the floor. On a horse, with a top hat on.\u201d</p> <p>Today, he says, even if players play really badly, a manager needs to say \u2018\u201cyou did well there, but here\u2019s how you could have done better\u201d. Clough really did say to players \u201cget your hair cut, young man,\u201d and the players did as they were told. He admits he occasionally suggests to his players they take a trip to the barber. \u201cThe idea of asking them to do errands for me, like Cloughie did, forget it. It\u2019s just not happening.\u201d</p> <p>What he did learn from Clough, though, is \u201cthe value of simplicity\u201d. He says: \u201cDon\u2019t overcomplicate. I mean, I never made it at Forest, but I was there three years and I saw him a lot, we were in and around the senior players and everyone knew their role, because he kept it simple. The game is a lot bigger, a lot more complicated in some ways, but you still have to try to keep it simple.</p> <p>\u201cMost people think footballers are thick.

Mentally, though, he is not so sure. \u201cLife is really different. The earthiness has gone. Is there the same desire, dedication, drive to achieve? You are not going to be a player without the will and the desire and the belief \u2026 People now want the Ferrari and the big house, the kind of thing that never crossed my mind.\u201d</p> <p>He thinks Clough would struggle with a lot in the modern game. Agents. Social media. Tattoos! \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be \u2018get your hair cut\u2019 but \u2018get rid of your tattoos, young man\u2019.\u201d Dyche is closer to Clough on this than he is to the players. \u201cEveryone has a tattoo, thinking they\u2019re different, but it means they\u2019re all the same.\u201d He mimics a player \u2013 \u201c\u2018Oh, but my sleeve is different!\u2019 \u2013 I reckon about five of our players don\u2019t have one. Listen, I\u2019m not anti-tattoo, I just don\u2019t understand it.\u201d</p> <p>But does any of it matter, Grace interjects, provided they play well? \u201cAh,\u201d he says, \u201cbut these things can get confusing. It is not the tattoos. It\u2019s that you can start believing in these things more than the job. The car, the lifestyle, it becomes bigger than the job, it softens you and swerves you off the job, takes the edge away.\u201d Ironically, given that the tattoo-isation of modern football and modern Britain owes as much to David Beckham as anyone else, he cites him as the best example of someone who was able to do all the off-field stuff while remaining at the top of his game on it. \u201cMadness all around him, yet delivering all the time.\u201d</p> <p>In the end, he says, for all the knowledge that data and analytics can give you, managers still have to be able to make human judgments about players. \u201cIf there is a flaw in the academy system it\u2019s that they try to tell them everything. Kids are taught the same. They look the same. So you\u2019re constantly looking for the X factor. It\u2019s the hardest thing, that mystical ingredient, instinct, the four-second hit, like/dislike, it can come unbelievably quickly.

Part of it is leaving him alone. I am still learning about Dwight as a person. He had a knock at 14, he was rejected by Man U. That can be a powerful thing. He stuck at it. That\u2019s a good sign. He listens. That is a good sign. At Burnley we have to have them all on top form. We are not making big statements about how superior we are. The basics have to be there, delivery for the team, not just yourself.\u201d Annoyingly, he disabused Grace of the notion, which I have happily created in my own home, that I am something of a football adviser to him and his No 2 Ian Woan. \u201cOh my God, this thing about him advising me. I don\u2019t tell him about politics and he doesn\u2019t tell me about football. He\u2019s a fan. He may be a fan who knows more than most, because he knows a lot of people, but he is a fan.\u201d As for his politics, Dyche is a remainer \u2013 though he somewhat surprised me in naming Margaret Thatcher in his \u201csix-a-side team to save the world\u201d. \u201cYou\u2019re doing this to wind me up now, aren\u2019t you?\u201d \u201cWhen I was growing up, she was just such a big figure, doing so much, never off the news and I thought my God, that is some woman, in the world as it was then, you must have something special to be doing that job the way you do it.\u201d Fair point, I said to Grace. \u201cFeminist in a way,\u201d she said. \u201cI reckon he is a seven out of 10.\u201d Sean Dyche\u2019s interview for the Football, Feminism and Everything in Between podcast is available now",

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sir Alan Duncan, the former Foreign Office minister, said he wanted the Commons to hold an effective confidence vote in Boris Johnson tomorrow to avoid a constitutional crisis. </strong>Some people may suspect that Duncan, a longstanding critic of Johnson\u2019s was trying to bring him down before the Queen even had a chance to appoint him as PM on Wednesday afternoon. But Duncan put a more positive gloss on what he was doing. He said that this be the first time in living memory where a minority government changes PM mid-term and he said that, to avoid a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, he thought it was important to establish that Johnson had the confidence of the Commons. Speaking to Sky, Duncan said he would have voted to back Johnson. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/jul/22/brexit-tory-leadership-boris-johnson-dismisses-boris-johnsons-claim-moon-landing-style-can-do-spirit-will-solve-brexit-live-news?page=with:block-5d35c9a18f08d0b6ca535839#block-5d35c9a18f08d0b6ca535839\"> 3.40pm.)</a></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Duncan said he did not know why John Bercow, the Speaker, turned down his application for a debate.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He cast doubt on Johnson\u2019s ability to be a good PM, while claiming he was not motivated by animosity.</strong> Asked about his views of Johnson, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When I was his deputy I was totally loyal. We never had an argument. I never bad mouthed him. So I\u2019ve served both foreign secretaries. And I\u2019ve no doubt which of the two is the more capable and more competent. So I have very grave concerns that he flies by the seat of his pants, and it\u2019s all a bit haphazard and ramshackle. But there\u2019s no personal animosity of any sort. I just think he\u2019s going to go smack into a crisis of government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When asked if he thought Johnson was fit to be PM, Duncan replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I will never say that he\u2019s unfit to be prime minister. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Duncan also claimed he wanted Johnson to succeed.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a Conservative, I\u2019m a patriot.

There seem to have been two reasons for this. First, Duncan was pushing for a vote tomorrow - after Johnson\u2019s probable election as Tory leader, but before he gets appointed prime minister (which is due to happen on Wednesday afternoon). And, much more importantly, only the leader of the opposition can table a no confidence motion in the government that has to be debated. (Other MPs can table no confidence motions, but they just get printed as early day motions and then ignored.)</p> \n  <p>Instead, Duncan tried to use standing order 24 to hold an emergency debate on a motion that would have effectively amounted to a confidence vote in Johnson.</p> \n  <p>SO24 allows MPs to call for emergency debates on topical issues, normally held on the day an MP applies, and lasting for up to three hours.</p> \n  <p>But for an SO24 debate to happen, the Speaker has to allow the MP to apply, by making a very short speech in the Commons chamber, and the Speaker then decides whether it should go ahead. John Bercow has blocked this bid at the first hurdle; he is not even allowing Duncan to make his application in the chamber.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T14:33:04.915Z\">at 3.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d35c4538f08d0b6ca5357ee\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T14:16:01.288Z\">3.16pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Alan Duncan claims Speaker has blocked attempt to hold vote on whether Boris Johnson has confidence of MPs</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>These are from the BBC\u2019s<strong> Laura Kuenssberg.</strong></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1153305713772552194\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1.

The prime minister was chairing a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra to consider how to react to the capture of the Stena Impero on Friday. Officials said the meeting would consider the options for \u201cstrengthening current reassurances\u201d to commercial shipping as well as the response to Tehran. </p> \n  <p>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do not seek confrontation with Iran but it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to seize a ship going about legitimate business through internationally recognised shipping lanes.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The spokesman said the ship was seized under \u201cfalse and illegal pretences and the Iranians should release it and its crew immediately\u201d. As the Press Association reports, military experts have warned that cuts to the Royal Navy had left it over-stretched, with too few warships to protect British interests. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The high volume of ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz - up to 30 ships covering more than 100 nautical miles - makes it impossible to escort vessels individually. </p> \n   <p>We already work closely with international partners to ensure a co-ordinated effort to defend freedom of navigation, this includes sharing information on threats to shipping and offering mutual protection for each other\u2019s vessels.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Downing Street said there had not been a US offer to escort all UK ships in the region. But the spokesman said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The US has been discussing with a number of countries, including the UK, how we might deliver maritime security in the face of recent threats to shipping.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, will update MPs later on the situation.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b32b79ed60521a440cd362bd16ffd1dd41f988e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b32b79ed60521a440cd362bd16ffd1dd41f988e/0_147_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iranian Revolutionary Guards patrolling around the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero anchored off the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas yesterday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iranian Revolutionary Guards patrolling around the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero anchored off the Iranian port city of Bandar Abbas yesterday.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hasan Shirvani/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d35940c8f08cf92bb77496d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T10:51:58.822Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Tory MP Charlie Elphicke charged with three counts of sexual assault</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is from the Press Association.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, has been charged with three counts of sexual assault against two women, the Crown Prosecution Service said. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Elphicke was suspended from the Conservative party for just over a year after allegations of sexual offences were made against him, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/12/tory-mps-suspended-over-sex-allegations-reinstated-for-confidence-vote\">he had his suspension lifted so that he could take part in the no confidence vote in Theresa May in December.</a> He has strongly denied any criminal wrongdoing.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d5fd7163cfa95efe9d9ef05df34fb2cb3b59360f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d5fd7163cfa95efe9d9ef05df34fb2cb3b59360f/0_149_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Elphicke\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Elphicke</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Findler/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d358c218f0845f89e311e99\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T10:36:05.029Z\">11.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Polling shows millions of Brexit voters do not support no-deal, says Gordon Brown</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Gordon Brown</strong>, the former Labour prime minister, has been speaking at an event this morning organised by the IPPR thinktank and Hope not Hate, which campaigns against fascism and the far-right. Here are the main points, based on the text of the speech sent out in advance.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brown says most voters oppose a no-deal Brexit, with millions of leave supporters saying it would be bad for Britain. </strong>He is referring to <a href=\"https://www.hopenothate.org.uk/campaigns/nodealbrexit/nodealbrexit-the-polling/\">some polling released by Hope not Hate today</a> which shows that, by a margin of more than two to one, people are more likely to think leaving the EU without a deal will be bad for Britain than good for Britain. Brown says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Elected by a smaller electorate than voted for Ed Balls on Strictly Come Dancing, [Boris Johnson] will have to come face to face with a very hard truth [if he becomes PM on Wednesday]: Millions of Brexit voters do not support a no-deal Brexit.</p> \n   <p>According to the poll by Hope Not Hate, who are, to their credit, launching this community No To No-Deal campaign today, three million of those who voted leave in 2016 say that exiting the EU without a deal would be bad for Britain.</p> \n   <p>While the Conservative party has been talking to itself, Johnson\u2019s \u2019do or die\u2019 plan to leave on October 31 with or without a deal is losing support.</p> \n   <p>Perhaps the most revealing figure of all is that 40 per cent of Labour Brexit voters have been changing their minds. </p> \n   <p>And I believe dissent about Brexit will grow as people find what a no-deal really means.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He says a no-deal Brexit would be a betrayal of what people were promised in the Brexit referendum and in the 2017 Tory election manifesto. </strong>He says:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In the run-up to the referendum the official Vote Leave campaign ruled out a no-deal Brexit, one of their publications stating: \u2018Taking back control is a careful change, not a sudden stop. We will negotiate the terms of a new deal before we start any legal process to leave\u2019. </p> \n   <p>Another briefing paper stressed that if the country voted to leave, it would be on the basis of \u2018a new UK-EU treaty based on free trade and friendly co-operation\u2019.</p> \n   <p>And although Mr Johnson now insists on a hard deadline of Halloween, Vote Leave argued at the time of the referendum that \u2018our guiding principle should be \u2018safety first and flexibility\u2019. Is a no-deal safety first? </p> \n   <p>Nor were the voters asked to sign up to a no-deal Brexit even as a last resort at the 2017 general election. The Tory manifesto promised \u2018the best possible deal for Britain as we leave the European Union delivered by a smooth, orderly Brexit\u2019.</p> \n   <p>Smooth and orderly? A phrase that rings as hollow as Mrs May\u2019s promise of a government that would be \u2018strong and stable\u2019.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He says a no-deal Brexit would be unprecedented as a \u201cpeacetime act of self-harm\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When future historians look back, they will be shocked to discover how such an act of economic self-harm that runs wholly counter to the national interest could ever be portrayed by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as the height of patriotism and criticism from any quarter be dismissed as a betrayal of Britain and all we stand for.</p> \n   <p>Even if some of the immediate chaos forecast by officials is averted on the day, the long-term economic impact of no-deal Brexit is where the calamity lies. British history includes self-inflicted wounds \u2013 military disasters such as the Charge of the Light Brigade and the fiasco of Gallipoli \u2013 but no peacetime act of self-harm can rival a no-deal Brexit for which we are so woefully unprepared and from which even now the new European Commission president is offering to deliver us \u2013 and we are refusing the help.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He says the risk of a no-deal Brexit to the union means Johnson could be \u201cfated to be remembered not as the 55th prime minister of the UK but as the first prime minister of England\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hopenothate/status/1153245106302062593\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/OfficeGSBrown?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OfficeGSBrown</a>: 'I fear for the cohesion or our community and country.'

Johnson has been watching the TV over the weekend and he has decided that, if humans can land a man on the moon, they can construct a mechanism for allowing frictionless trade at the Ireland/Northern Ireland border without the UK having to be in the the customs union.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an extract from his column.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Think of that achievement [the moon landing], and then <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/07/21/boris-johnson-ignore-pessimists-can-put-man-moon-can-solve/\">think of the current debate about actually leaving the EU </a>\u2013 which has been going on for so long that we are in danger of believing that we are incapable of finding our way out; like someone who has lost their car in a vast multi-storey car park, and is beginning to despair of ever leaving at all.</p> \n   <p>At its core, the problem with leaving the EU is technical and logistical. In order to come out of the EU customs union, and to maintain frictionless trade across the border in Northern Ireland (and indeed at Calais and elsewhere) we will need ways of checking goods for rules of origin, and whether they conform to the right standards, and whether or not they have been smuggled \u2013 but we have to do it away from the border, because no one can accept border controls in Northern Ireland.</p> \n   <p>And I am afraid that there are technological pessimists \u2013 some of them apparently in London \u2013 who seem genuinely to think that such technical solutions are impossible, that they are a kind of logical contradiction, a mythological species that we will never see in this universe. Are they right? Of course not. There is abundant scope to find the solutions necessary \u2013 and they can and will be found, in the context of the Free Trade Agreement that we will negotiate with the EU (and this is common to both candidates in the current leadership contest) after we have left on October 31.</p> \n   <p>It is absurd that we have even allowed ourselves to be momentarily delayed by these technical issues. If they could use hand-knitted computer code to make a frictionless re-entry to Earth\u2019s atmosphere in 1969, we can solve the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border ...</p> \n   <p>It is time this country recovered some its can-do spirit. We can come out of the EU on October 31, and yes, we certainly have the technology to do so. What we need now is the will and the drive.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In the past, in response to a complaint about an inaccuracy about Brexit in one of Johnson\u2019s columns, <a href=\"https://www.ipso.co.uk/rulings-and-resolution-statements/ruling/?id=00154-19\">the Daily Telegraph told the Independent Press Standards Organisation</a> that the column in question was \u201cclearly comically polemical, and could not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters.\u201d That does not seem to be the paper\u2019s take on this article, although one can never be entirely sure.</p> \n  <p>But the objections to Johnson\u2019s argument are numerous, including: 1) This is what people say about almost any insuperable problem, normally ones that never do get solved (like abolishing poverty); 2) Putting a man on the moon took the Americans the best part of a decade, while Johnson is committed to delivering Brexit in just 100 days; 3) If it were that easy, the UK and the EU would probably have found a solution within the last three years; 4) There is no example in the world of an entirely frictionless border between two countries with different customs arrangements; and 5) the Americans never had to worry about smuggling being a problem, or sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, or lunar paramilitaries, when they established their own border crossing on the surface of the moon. </p> \n  <p>On the Today programme this <strong>Tony Blair</strong>, the Labour former prime minister, came up with another specific objection, as well as dismissing Johnson\u2019s entire stance. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s a very Boris Johnson approach to thing which is to say \u2018Look, never mind the detail, but if we only believe in ourselves, we can do it\u2019. I found the article this morning - it\u2019s one of these things where essentially he was saying was, look, the Americans put a man on the moon, and therefore surely we can find a way round the Irish border problem. To which the obvious response of the Europeans will be, \u2018Well, if it\u2019s that simple, why are you opposed to the backstop?\u2019 But in any event the two things are obviously rather technically different. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Here is the agenda for the day.<br></p> \n  <p><em>9.30am: </em>The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) publishes its latest economic forecast for the economy.</p> \n  <p><em>11am: </em>Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Jo Swinson has been elected the new leader of the Liberal Democrats, winning a vote among party members to take over following Vince Cable\u2019s two-year tenure, with the party newly resurgent in the polls. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has said the government will try to put together a European-led mission to protect shipping in the Gulf. In a Commons statement about Iran\u2019s seizure of a British-flagged tanker, Hunt said: Because freedom of navigation is a vital interest of every nation, we will now seek to put together a European-led maritime protection mission to support safe passage of both crew and cargo in this vital region. We have had constructive discussions with a number of countries in the last 48 hours and will discuss later this week the best way to complement this with recent US proposals in this area. The new force will be focused on free navigation, bearing in mind that one fifth of the world\u2019s oil, a quarter of its liquefied natural gas \u2013 and trade worth half a trillion dollars - pass through the Strait of Hormuz every year . It will not be part of the US maximum pressure policy on Iran because we remain committed to preserving the Iran nuclear agreement. Alan Duncan, a senior Conservative critic of Boris Johnson, resigned from the government in order to test whether the new prime minister commands the confidence of the House of Commons. The mounting risk of no-deal Brexit may have pushed the UK economy into a recession already, one of the country\u2019s foremost economic forecasters has warned. School budgets face cuts to fund a new teachers\u2019 pay rise after the government announced it would only partially fund the award of 2.75%. Three former prime ministers, Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, have all told Boris Johnson that opting for a no-deal Brexit would be unacceptable. (See 1.55pm.) Boris Johnson has put his faith in optimism to find technological solutions to prevent a hard Irish border if he becomes prime minister, as the DUP impressed on him the need to resolve the issue of the backstop to keep their support. Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet is backing a plan to speed up the expulsion from the party of antisemites. According to the party, Jeremy Corbyn told a shadow cabinet meeting: It is wrong to deny there is antisemitism in the Labour party. And those who deny that it does exist are part of the problem. We have to stand for a serious, anti-racist, inclusive socialism. Labour is not an antisemitic party. But one antisemite is always one too many. I also know that some complaints have taken too long to deal with. This is not good enough. Our members don\u2019t want to share their party with anyone who is racist - and they want to be able to demonstrate there is no place for antisemitism among them. Corbyn presented the shadow cabinet with two options for speeding up the party\u2019s complaints process. Under his preferred option the most serious of cases would be referred to a special panel consisting of the party\u2019s general secretary and NEC officers who would have the power to expel the member - allowing for more rapid action. After the meeting the shadow cabinet issued a statement saying: As part of tackling antisemitism, the shadow cabinet has today supported the proposal for summary exclusion outlined by the Labour leader, which he will put to the national executive committee tomorrow. The shadow cabinet also supports the proposal to introduce independent oversight of our processes, and will continue to seek to engage with Jewish community organisations to build confidence. The Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke has been charged with three counts of sexual assault relating to two women, prosecutors have said. Self-styled yellow vest protester James Goddard has been handed a suspended prison sentence and been banned from an area around parliament for hurling abuse at remain-supporting MP Anna Soubry, the Press Association reports. That\u2019s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments. This is a fascinating chart. The tweet is from James Morris, a pollster who in the past has worked for Labour, but the data is from a poll published by Lord Ashcroft earlier this month (pdf). This graphic presents the information in a much clearer way than the table in the Ashcroft report (table 10). The two most positive readings in this chart are those that show what remain-voting Labour voters feel about the Green party (they prefer it to Labour) and what leave-voting Tories feel about the Brexit party (they prefer it to the Conservative party). In her first letter to party members as Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson said: I love this party - and honestly if you\u2019d told me when I first joined at the age of 17 that I\u2019d one day get the chance to write you this message, as the party\u2019s new leader, I\u2019d never have believed you. The first thing I want to do is say a huge thank you to everyone who took part in this election, and especially to my good friend Ed Davey. Over the last seven weeks Ed has shown the country what an outstanding politician he is; energetic, passionate and thoughtful. We\u2019ve debated and challenged each other in the way the contest deserved, but always in a spirit of friendship and unity. The contrast with the Conservative party couldn\u2019t be starker. I also want to pay tribute to Vince Cable, whose leadership has put us in an exciting position to have a real impact on British politics. And I want to pay tribute to all of you, who not only have challenged and tested us over the course of the contest, but whose hard work has ensured the party I\u2019m now so proud to lead is looking at a much brighter future than many predicted just six months ago, ready to take on the challenges ahead. The first of those is, of course, stopping Brexit. And as your new leader, it\u2019s the task that is absolutely at the top of my agenda. When I say Bollocks to Brexit I mean it. This isn\u2019t a normal political issue - this is about the fundamental direction of our country for generations to Brexit, in any form, is a disaster for our country and we\u2019ll do everything in our power to stop it. This is from Ed Davey, congratulating Jo Swinson on beating him in the Lib Dem leadership contest. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s profile of Jo Swinson. In the Commons Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is making a statement about the situation in the Gulf. He says the seizure of the British-flagged Stena Impero was an act of state piracy. He says the UK will try to put together a European-led mission to protect ships in the Gulf. He says it will not be part of the US maximum pressure policy on Iran, because the UK remains committed to the Iran nuclear deal. He says British-flagged ships will be asked to advise the government on when they are planning to sail through the Strait of Hormuz, so that they can be offered assistance. He says Iran may end up with an increased foreign naval presence on its doorstep. But if that happens, Iran only has itself to blame, he says. Here are the Lib Dem election results in full. Some 106,075 ballot papers were issued, and 76,429 were returned, giving a turnout of 72 per cent. Ed Davey: 28,021 (37%) Jo Swinson: 47,997 (63%) Swinson says this is a time for working together. And she says she has a message for MPs in other parties: if you want to stop Brexit and Corbyn, work with the Lib Dems. My door is always open, she says. And she says she has a message for people at home. If you want change, it is not enough to shout at the TV. Join us, she says. She winds up saying we should change politics so we can change the country. Jo Swinson is still giving her victory speech. She says in 2017 she knew she had to stand in East Dunbartonshire again to try to win back her seat. The 2017 campaign was ugly, she says. But she says she had seen this already in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum. That campaign was marked by Twitter trolls and rows about fake news. She says she felt sick in 2016 when Nigel Farage said leave won without a shot being filed. Just a week before Jo Cox had been murdered. But Farage did not seem to care, she says. She says the Lib Dems champion freedom. But Brexit means the next generation will be less free to work, live and love across Europe. She talks about a rise in the number of hate crimes, and Islamophobia and antisemitism at the heart of politics. And she condemns President Trump. Ilhan Omar is a strong woman, she says. But because of what Trump says migrant women feel less safe. Turning to Boris Johnson, she says he only cares about himself. Ask Kim Darroch. \u201cBritain deserves better than Boris Johnson,\u201d she says. And, on Labour, she says any party that cannot decide on the biggest issue of our time does not deserve her time or her vote. Swinson says she stands her today not just as Lib Dem leader, but as a candidate for PM. She says there is no limit to her ambition. She is ready to take her party into a general election and win it, she says. Here is my colleague Peter Walker\u2019s story on Jo Swinson\u2019s election. Swinson says, when she decided to stand, she thought the challenge would be different. The Lib Dems were only on around 8% in the poll. New parties (ie Change UK) were after their vote. But now there has been a turnaround, she says. She says Liberal Democrats are winning again. She pays tribute to her two predecessors: to Tim Farron for saying after the referendum that the Lib Dems would be the party of remain, and to Sir Vince Cable for overseeing a transformation in the party\u2019s fortunes. Jo Swinson is speaking now. She says she is \u201cover the moon\u201d to be elected leader. The Liberal Democrats are like a family to her, she says. She says liberalism is alive and thriving. And she will do whatever she can to stop Brexit, she says. She says the Lib Dems will lead the revive the country needs. She thanks her husband, the former Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames, and her mum, and says her two young children have brought her pure joy. And she thanks Sir Ed Davey. She says he has carried himself in the campaign with grace. She has huge respect for him, and they agree on most things, she says. She says this did not make for an interesting contest. She is proud to call him a friend, and he will be central to her team, she says. Brinton reads out the results Ed Davey: 28,021 Jo Swinson: 47,XXX (We could not hear the rest of Swinson\u2019s tally because there was so much cheering.) She says Cable has campaigned tirelessly for the Lib Dems\u2019 recovery. The Lib Dems won more than 700 council seats this year, and the party is now running at about 20% in the polls. She says the Lib Dem leadership contest has been unlike the Tories\u2019. Ed Davey and Jo Swinson have fought a courteous campaign, and they have respected each other. They have shown that there is a different way of doing politics. The message from members has been how hard it has been to decide, because both are exceptional candidates, she says. Sal Brinton, the Lib Dem president, is making the announcement. She pays tribute to Sir Vince Cable, the outgoing leader. We\u2019re about to get the announcement. In the House of Lords peers have just voted to keep the amendment to the Northern Ireland (executive formation) bill passed by MPs last week intended to stop a new prime minister proroguing parliament to stop the Commons blocking a no-deal Brexit. The result of the Lib Dem leadership contest will be announced soon. BBC News has just broadcast Laura Kuenssberg\u2019s interview with Sir Alan Duncan. Here are the main points. Sir Alan Duncan, the former Foreign Office minister, said he wanted the Commons to hold an effective confidence vote in Boris Johnson tomorrow to avoid a constitutional crisis. Some people may suspect that Duncan, a longstanding critic of Johnson\u2019s was trying to bring him down before the Queen even had a chance to appoint him as PM on Wednesday afternoon. But Duncan put a more positive gloss on what he was doing. He said that this be the first time in living memory where a minority government changes PM mid-term and he said that, to avoid a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d, he thought it was important to establish that Johnson had the confidence of the Commons. Speaking to Sky, Duncan said he would have voted to back Johnson. (See 3.40pm.) Duncan said he did not know why John Bercow, the Speaker, turned down his application for a debate. He cast doubt on Johnson\u2019s ability to be a good PM, while claiming he was not motivated by animosity. Asked about his views of Johnson, he replied: When I was his deputy I was totally loyal. We never had an argument. I never bad mouthed him. So I\u2019ve served both foreign secretaries. And I\u2019ve no doubt which of the two is the more capable and more competent. So I have very grave concerns that he flies by the seat of his pants, and it\u2019s all a bit haphazard and ramshackle. But there\u2019s no personal animosity of any sort. I just think he\u2019s going to go smack into a crisis of government. When asked if he thought Johnson was fit to be PM, Duncan replied: I will never say that he\u2019s unfit to be prime minister. Duncan also claimed he wanted Johnson to succeed. I\u2019m a Conservative, I\u2019m a patriot. I want him to succeed. My judgment says that it is going to be very, very difficult. Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby has also been speaking to Sir Alan Duncan. Sir Alan Duncan refuses to rule out voting against Boris Johnson in a no confidence motion to stop a no-deal Brexit. A few words of explanation about the Alan Duncan story. Sir Alan Duncan did not try to table a formal motion of no confidence in Boris Johnson. There seem to have been two reasons for this. First, Duncan was pushing for a vote tomorrow - after Johnson\u2019s probable election as Tory leader, but before he gets appointed prime minister (which is due to happen on Wednesday afternoon). And, much more importantly, only the leader of the opposition can table a no confidence motion in the government that has to be debated. (Other MPs can table no confidence motions, but they just get printed as early day motions and then ignored.) Instead, Duncan tried to use standing order 24 to hold an emergency debate on a motion that would have effectively amounted to a confidence vote in Johnson. SO24 allows MPs to call for emergency debates on topical issues, normally held on the day an MP applies, and lasting for up to three hours. But for an SO24 debate to happen, the Speaker has to allow the MP to apply, by making a very short speech in the Commons chamber, and the Speaker then decides whether it should go ahead. John Bercow has blocked this bid at the first hurdle; he is not even allowing Duncan to make his application in the chamber. These are from the BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg. More than 750 people may have missed out on their right to vote because of pilot schemes requiring them to prove their identity, the Press Association reports. Pilot schemes in 10 council areas for the local elections in England left \u201cimportant questions\u201d unanswered, the Electoral Commission said. Labour claimed the voter ID trials were evidence of a \u201cblatant attempt by the Tories to rig the result of future elections\u201d and called for the programme to be abandoned. But the government insisted the schemes revealed requiring voters to show ID was a \u201creasonable and proportionate measure\u201d to tackle electoral fraud. The 10 trial areas in May\u2019s elections were Braintree, Broxtowe, Craven, Derby, Mid-Sussex, North Kesteven, North West Leicestershire, Pendle, Watford and Woking. A review published by the Electoral Commission found up to 2,083 voters were initially refused a ballot paper because they lacked the required ID, and up to 758 of them did not return to cast their vote. Out of all those who went to their polling station in the pilots, the proportion who could not show ID and who did not return to vote ranged from 0.03% to 0.7%. The Cabinet Office also published its own review, saying the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people were able to cast their vote despite the voter ID rules being piloted. Charlie Elphicke has been suspended from the Conservative whip, party sources have said, following the news that he has been charged with three counts of sexual assault. His solicitor has said he is confident he will clear his name. Boris Johnson has repeatedly said that if, as expected, he becomes prime minister on Wednesday, the UK will definitely leave the EU by 31 October. But a majority of voters, and even 50% of leave voters, do not believe that will happen, a YouGov poll has found. Here are a couple of comments from below the line on Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit/moon landings analogy. (See 9.32am.) This is from Conor Burns, a Tory MP supporting Boris Johnson\u2019s leadership campaign. It is a joke about how Alan Duncan was happy to be known as the deputy foreign secretary, even though this was not a proper title (there is no such position) but just a term used by the media occasionally to refer to Duncan. This is from Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents mainly secondary school head teachers, on the 2.75% pay rise for teachers. (See 1.25pm.) Our reading of the government\u2019s statement is that the first 2% of the award will have to come from existing school budgets which are already under intense pressure and cannot sustain more unfunded costs. It is inevitable that this will result in more cutbacks, and while schools will do their best to implement the increase, we would not be surprised if some are unable to do so. The fact that this announcement has been made so late is not at all helpful for schools as they have had no time to factor these costs into next year\u2019s budgets. Here is Theresa May\u2019s reply to Alan Duncan following his resignation. (See 10.43am.) The fourth former prime minister alive today is David Cameron. He probably feels the say way Sir John Major, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown do about a no-deal Brexit (see 1.55pm), but he been reluctant to say anything of substance about the government\u2019s handling of Brexit since he left Number 10 three years ago. He is probably saving up his thoughts for his memoirs, which are out in the autumn. There are four former prime ministers still alive. (Theresa May probably already feels like a former prime minister, but she does not join the club until Wednesday). Today three of them have spoken out against a no-deal Brexit: Tony Blair, in an article in the Times (paywall) and on the Today programme (see 9.32am); Gordon Brown in a speech this morning (see 11.36am); and now Sir John Major. Major has just issued this statement. It is a timely moment to note that whoever becomes our prime minister this week, he will be far more than Leader of the Conservative party. As for every prime minister, he must act for our nation as a whole \u2013 not just one part of it. He must also remember that no-one born this century voted for Brexit \u2013 let alone a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit. Words and actions have consequences, and never more so than when they are those of the prime minister. As the evidence mounts of the probable economic and social damage of a \u201cno-deal\u201d Brexit \u2013 and of the rising opposition to it \u2013 the new prime minister must choose whether to be the spokesman for an ultra-Brexit faction, or the servant of the nation he leads. He cannot be both, and the choice he makes will define his premiership from the moment of its birth. As the most powerful politician in the four nations of our United Kingdom, any prime minister has the right to expect support but \u2013 if he acts as the spokesman for one hard-line faction only \u2013 he cannot complain if he faces uncompromising opposition from those who believe they have had their views ignored. I hope our new leader understands this, and is fully prepared for the enormity of the task before him. Boris Johnson must choose whether he wants to serve the nation, or just \u201can ultra-Brexit faction\u201d, says Sir John Major. As PM he can\u2019t do both, says Major. Major says Johnson will face \u201cuncompromising opposition\u201d if he just represents Brexiters as PM. Here are links to the written ministerial statements out today with details of the public sector pay awards, with extracts. Teachers Last year, the government announced the largest pay rise in nearly a decade for almost a million public sector workers. Building on this, this year I have decided to accept in full the STRB\u2019s recommendations for a 2.75% uplift to the minima and maxima of all pay ranges and allowances. The pay award will both raise starting salaries and increase the competitiveness of the pay framework. As a result, minimum starting salaries for classroom teachers will see an increase between \u00a3652 (Rest of England) and \u00a3816 (Inner London), and classroom teachers at the top of the main pay range could see an increase between \u00a3963 and \u00a31,110. For more experienced classroom teachers at the top of the upper pay range, it could mean an increase of between \u00a31,084 and \u00a31,327. As a result, the pay ranges for all teachers and leaders will see an uplift. Thanks to the flexible performance-based pay system we have, schools can choose to give teachers and leaders a higher pay rise where this is appropriate to their local context and budget. Doctors and dentists This pay rise represents one of the biggest uplifts in pay for medical staff for over a decade. In addition to their pay, medical staff continue to benefit from defined benefit pensions, which are amongst the most generous available. Today\u2019s pay award is worth: Between \u00a31,940 and \u00a32,630 for consultants Between \u00a3970 and \u00a31,820 for specialty doctors Between \u00a31,360 and \u00a32,250 for associate specialists Police Last year, the government announced the largest pay rise in nearly a decade for almost a million public sector workers. Building on this, this year the government has accepted in full the recommendations of the PRRB that a consolidated increase of 2.5% should be awarded to all ranks at all pay points. It has also accepted a corresponding increase to London weighting and the dog handlers\u2019 allowance and an increase in the on-call allowance for officers in the federated ranks from \u00a315 to \u00a320 for each 24-hour period on-call. These will be implemented with effect from 1 September 2019. Prison officers Last year, the government announced the largest pay rise in nearly a decade for almost a million public sector workers. Today we are building on that with a pay award that is worth at least 2.2% for all prison staff and 3% for our Band 3 officers on the \u2018Fair and Sustainable\u2019 terms and conditions. This is the second year in a row we have put in place awards over 2% for our prison staff and this year\u2019s settlement represents the highest consolidated increase for over 10 years. In addition to the headline increases we will also implement the totality of the other Review Body recommendations. This represents a full package for staff that will support us to recruit and retain prison officers and managers, contributing to safer prisons and reduced reoffending. In addition to their pay, prison officers continue to benefit from defined benefit pensions, which are amongst the most generous available. For a Band 3 officer on the modern terms and conditions the pay settlement is worth on average \u00a31,277. Armed forces Last year, the government announced the largest pay rise in nearly a decade for almost a million public sector workers. This year\u2019s award builds on this and focuses attention on increasing pay for the most junior sailors, soldiers, and airmen and women, to ensure that they continue to receive a living wage. Consequently, the basic pay for other ranks on completion of their initial training will now be \u00a320,000. This pay rise of over 6% represents an increase of \u00a31,140 for over 7,200 newly trained sailors, soldiers, and airmen and airwomen. The pay award also represents an annual increase of \u00a3995 in the nominal \u2018average\u2019 salary in the armed forces (which is at the corporal level), as well as an annual increase of \u00a3769 in starting salary for an officer. Senior civil servants SSRB recommendations set a 2.2% pay award with money allocated in the following priority order: 0.9% targeted at pay progression and anomalies 0.2% set aside for minima increases 1% increase for all SCS not benefiting from the minima increases, and those benefiting by less than 1% from the minima increases should be \u2018topped up\u2019 to a 1% increase (estimated cost of 0.9% of the paybill) 0.2% set aside to implement any specialist pay proposals. The SSRB also recommended reductions to the maxima and commented on priority work to be undertaken for the 2020-21 pay award. The government accepts the SSRB\u2019s recommendations in full with the following exceptions: The overall figure should be limited to an average 2% increase in line with the figure contained in the delegated pay remit guidance. The reduction of 0.2% will be taken from the money set aside for specialist pay which we will not be implementing this pay year. The government accepts the recommendation to decrease the maxima for all pay bands, but to delay implementation of this to next year whilst further work is undertaken on capability-based pay progression to ensure the levels set are robust and there is a clear and positive narrative for reduction. There are 30 written ministerial statements coming today, including quite a few relating to public sector pay. You can read them as they come out here. In a press notice, the Treasury says almost a million public sector workers are getting above-inflation pay increases. It says: Each workforce is different and reaches its own settlement with the government. All six deals finalised today hand pay rises higher than the current 2% rate of inflation (CPI June 2019, ONS) for the 2019/20 financial year. The pay rises will be backdated to the start of each work force\u2019s financial year and mean a rise of 2.75% for school teachers, 2.5% for consultants and dentists, 2.5% for police officers, 2.9% per cent for personnel in the armed forces, at least 2.2% for prison officers and 2% for senior civil servants and senior military staff. Pay for most public sector workers also rose above inflation last year after the government ended the across-the-board 1% pay rise cap in September 2017. Earnings growth for public sector workers reached 3.6% last year. Here is the Tory MP Ben Bradley on Alan Duncan\u2019s resignation. Charlie Elphicke\u2019s solicitor has issued a statement saying Elphicke is confident he will clear his name, Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby reports. Theresa May, senior ministers and security chiefs have met to discuss the UK\u2019s response to the Gulf crisis following the seizure of a British-flagged tanker by Iran, the Press Association reports.Downing Street has been hit by claims that the government \u201cdropped the ball\u201d by failing to prepare for Tehran\u2019s actions against British shipping in the Strait of Hormuz. The prime minister was chairing a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra to consider how to react to the capture of the Stena Impero on Friday. Officials said the meeting would consider the options for \u201cstrengthening current reassurances\u201d to commercial shipping as well as the response to Tehran. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman told journalists: We do not seek confrontation with Iran but it is unacceptable and highly escalatory to seize a ship going about legitimate business through internationally recognised shipping lanes. The spokesman said the ship was seized under \u201cfalse and illegal pretences and the Iranians should release it and its crew immediately\u201d. As the Press Association reports, military experts have warned that cuts to the Royal Navy had left it over-stretched, with too few warships to protect British interests. The prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: The high volume of ships moving through the Strait of Hormuz - up to 30 ships covering more than 100 nautical miles - makes it impossible to escort vessels individually. We already work closely with international partners to ensure a co-ordinated effort to defend freedom of navigation, this includes sharing information on threats to shipping and offering mutual protection for each other\u2019s vessels. Downing Street said there had not been a US offer to escort all UK ships in the region. But the spokesman said: The US has been discussing with a number of countries, including the UK, how we might deliver maritime security in the face of recent threats to shipping. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, will update MPs later on the situation. This is from the Press Association. Charlie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover, has been charged with three counts of sexual assault against two women, the Crown Prosecution Service said. Elphicke was suspended from the Conservative party for just over a year after allegations of sexual offences were made against him, but he had his suspension lifted so that he could take part in the no confidence vote in Theresa May in December. He has strongly denied any criminal wrongdoing. Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, has been speaking at an event this morning organised by the IPPR thinktank and Hope not Hate, which campaigns against fascism and the far-right. Here are the main points, based on the text of the speech sent out in advance. Brown says most voters oppose a no-deal Brexit, with millions of leave supporters saying it would be bad for Britain. He is referring to some polling released by Hope not Hate today which shows that, by a margin of more than two to one, people are more likely to think leaving the EU without a deal will be bad for Britain than good for Britain. Brown says: Elected by a smaller electorate than voted for Ed Balls on Strictly Come Dancing, [Boris Johnson] will have to come face to face with a very hard truth [if he becomes PM on Wednesday]: Millions of Brexit voters do not support a no-deal Brexit. According to the poll by Hope Not Hate, who are, to their credit, launching this community No To No-Deal campaign today, three million of those who voted leave in 2016 say that exiting the EU without a deal would be bad for Britain. While the Conservative party has been talking to itself, Johnson\u2019s \u2019do or die\u2019 plan to leave on October 31 with or without a deal is losing support. Perhaps the most revealing figure of all is that 40 per cent of Labour Brexit voters have been changing their minds. And I believe dissent about Brexit will grow as people find what a no-deal really means. He says a no-deal Brexit would be a betrayal of what people were promised in the Brexit referendum and in the 2017 Tory election manifesto. He says: In the run-up to the referendum the official Vote Leave campaign ruled out a no-deal Brexit, one of their publications stating: \u2018Taking back control is a careful change, not a sudden stop. We will negotiate the terms of a new deal before we start any legal process to leave\u2019. Another briefing paper stressed that if the country voted to leave, it would be on the basis of \u2018a new UK-EU treaty based on free trade and friendly co-operation\u2019. And although Mr Johnson now insists on a hard deadline of Halloween, Vote Leave argued at the time of the referendum that \u2018our guiding principle should be \u2018safety first and flexibility\u2019. Is a no-deal safety first? Nor were the voters asked to sign up to a no-deal Brexit even as a last resort at the 2017 general election. The Tory manifesto promised \u2018the best possible deal for Britain as we leave the European Union delivered by a smooth, orderly Brexit\u2019. Smooth and orderly? A phrase that rings as hollow as Mrs May\u2019s promise of a government that would be \u2018strong and stable\u2019. He says a no-deal Brexit would be unprecedented as a \u201cpeacetime act of self-harm\u201d. When future historians look back, they will be shocked to discover how such an act of economic self-harm that runs wholly counter to the national interest could ever be portrayed by Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson as the height of patriotism and criticism from any quarter be dismissed as a betrayal of Britain and all we stand for. Even if some of the immediate chaos forecast by officials is averted on the day, the long-term economic impact of no-deal Brexit is where the calamity lies. British history includes self-inflicted wounds \u2013 military disasters such as the Charge of the Light Brigade and the fiasco of Gallipoli \u2013 but no peacetime act of self-harm can rival a no-deal Brexit for which we are so woefully unprepared and from which even now the new European Commission president is offering to deliver us \u2013 and we are refusing the help. He says the risk of a no-deal Brexit to the union means Johnson could be \u201cfated to be remembered not as the 55th prime minister of the UK but as the first prime minister of England\u201d. And here is an extract from Sir Alan Duncan\u2019s resignation letter. He voted remain in the referendum. The UK does so much good in the world. It is tragic that just when we could have been the dominant intellectual and political force throughout Europe, and beyond, we have had to spend every day working beneath the dark cloud of Brexit. On a heartfelt personal note, I have known you and Philip for over 40 years, throughout which you have both displayed faultless dignity and an unstinting sense of duty. I am only sorry that your three years as prime minister have been brought to an end. You deserved better, but please take lasting comfort from the knowledge that your self-esteem can, and will forever, far exceed that of your critics. (Duncan may not have phrased that final sentence quite as intended. Boris Johnson\u2019s self-esteem probably far exceeds Theresa May\u2019s. Duncan seems to have been saying that the esteem in which she is held by others is higher.) Here is Sir Alan Duncan\u2019s resignation letter. My colleague Heather Stewart says Boris Johnson now seems be beset by \u201crolling resignations\u201d - a tactic that was used against Jeremy Corbyn. Note to Tories: the \u201crolling resignations\u201d directed at Corbyn by Labour front benchers did not achieve much in the end; three years on, he\u2019s still there. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour on Alan Duncan\u2019s resignation. Greg Hands, the former international trade minister, has criticised Sir Alan Duncan, Philip Hammond and David Gauke for announcing pre-emptive resignations. (See 9.48am.) He claims they are damaging the party. Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, has resigned today because he is not willing to serve under Boris Johnson, the Times\u2019 Steven Swinford reports. Number 10 has confirmed that Duncan has indeed gone. That is not especially surprising. Duncan has been fiercely critical of Johnson in public, including recently accusing Johnson of \u201ccontemptible negligence\u201d for his failure to back Sir Kim Darroch, at the time the US ambassador to Washington, in the face of attacks from President Trump. If Duncan was not resigning, he would almost certainly be sacked later this week. But what is unusual is the way Duncan, along with the cabinet ministers Philip Hammond and David Gauke, have decided to resign pre-emptively rather than let Johnson dismiss them. This is unusual, and illustrates quite how strong the opposition to Johnson is in some parts of the parliamentary Conservative party. Unless everything we know about the Conservative party turns out to be wrong, there are only about 60 hours to go before Boris Johnson becomes prime minister, and he has used what will probably be his final column in the Daily Telegraph (paywall) to reveal his long-awaited solution to Brexit, and in particular the Irish backstop problem. Johnson has been watching the TV over the weekend and he has decided that, if humans can land a man on the moon, they can construct a mechanism for allowing frictionless trade at the Ireland/Northern Ireland border without the UK having to be in the the customs union. Here\u2019s an extract from his column. Think of that achievement [the moon landing], and then think of the current debate about actually leaving the EU \u2013 which has been going on for so long that we are in danger of believing that we are incapable of finding our way out; like someone who has lost their car in a vast multi-storey car park, and is beginning to despair of ever leaving at all. At its core, the problem with leaving the EU is technical and logistical. In order to come out of the EU customs union, and to maintain frictionless trade across the border in Northern Ireland (and indeed at Calais and elsewhere) we will need ways of checking goods for rules of origin, and whether they conform to the right standards, and whether or not they have been smuggled \u2013 but we have to do it away from the border, because no one can accept border controls in Northern Ireland. And I am afraid that there are technological pessimists \u2013 some of them apparently in London \u2013 who seem genuinely to think that such technical solutions are impossible, that they are a kind of logical contradiction, a mythological species that we will never see in this universe. Are they right? Of course not. There is abundant scope to find the solutions necessary \u2013 and they can and will be found, in the context of the Free Trade Agreement that we will negotiate with the EU (and this is common to both candidates in the current leadership contest) after we have left on October 31. It is absurd that we have even allowed ourselves to be momentarily delayed by these technical issues. If they could use hand-knitted computer code to make a frictionless re-entry to Earth\u2019s atmosphere in 1969, we can solve the problem of frictionless trade at the Northern Irish border ... It is time this country recovered some its can-do spirit. We can come out of the EU on October 31, and yes, we certainly have the technology to do so. What we need now is the will and the drive. In the past, in response to a complaint about an inaccuracy about Brexit in one of Johnson\u2019s columns, the Daily Telegraph told the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the column in question was \u201cclearly comically polemical, and could not be reasonably read as a serious, empirical, in-depth analysis of hard factual matters.\u201d That does not seem to be the paper\u2019s take on this article, although one can never be entirely sure. But the objections to Johnson\u2019s argument are numerous, including: 1) This is what people say about almost any insuperable problem, normally ones that never do get solved (like abolishing poverty); 2) Putting a man on the moon took the Americans the best part of a decade, while Johnson is committed to delivering Brexit in just 100 days; 3) If it were that easy, the UK and the EU would probably have found a solution within the last three years; 4) There is no example in the world of an entirely frictionless border between two countries with different customs arrangements; and 5) the Americans never had to worry about smuggling being a problem, or sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, or lunar paramilitaries, when they established their own border crossing on the surface of the moon. On the Today programme this Tony Blair, the Labour former prime minister, came up with another specific objection, as well as dismissing Johnson\u2019s entire stance. He said: It\u2019s a very Boris Johnson approach to thing which is to say \u2018Look, never mind the detail, but if we only believe in ourselves, we can do it\u2019. I found the article this morning - it\u2019s one of these things where essentially he was saying was, look, the Americans put a man on the moon, and therefore surely we can find a way round the Irish border problem. To which the obvious response of the Europeans will be, \u2018Well, if it\u2019s that simple, why are you opposed to the backstop?\u2019 But in any event the two things are obviously rather technically different. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) publishes its latest economic forecast for the economy. 11am: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech on Brexit. As he writes in a Guardian article, he is urging MPs to reject no-deal as an option. 2pm: Sajid Javid, the home secretary, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee. After 3.30pm: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, is expected to make a statement in the Commons on Iran\u2019s seizure of a British-flagged tanker. 4pm: The Liberal Democrats announce the winner of their leadership contest. And at some point Jeremy Corbyn will chair a shadow cabinet meeting devoted to the subject of how Labour should address its antisemitism problem. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary when I wrap up. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. UPDATE: Brutha in the comments says I was wrong in what I said about the moon landings and sanitary and phytosanitary regulations. It just goes to show, you learn something new every day. There is more about the astronauts spending time in quarantine when they returned here.",

      "bodyText": "A US firm run by two billionaire entrepreneurs is being paid \u20ac62m (\u00a355.7m) in \u201cfinancial inducements\u201d as part of the Brexit-enforced relocation of the European Medicines Agency from London to Amsterdam. WeWork, a $47bn (\u00a337.7bn) property company founded by Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey, secured the cash from British and European taxpayers as part of a deal in which it will sublet the agency\u2019s former headquarters, EU documents reveal. All UK-based EU agencies have had to be relocated to other member states as a result of the UK\u2019s decision to leave the bloc. The Netherlands won the right to host the EMA while Paris secured the European Banking Authority. But before its move to the Netherlands, the EMA failed in its bid to break its 25-year lease with its landlord, the Canary Wharf Group. The EU agency had been facing \u00a3500m in costs, including an annual rent of \u20ac16m, on 26,000 sq metres (280,000 sq ft) of office space at 30 Churchill Place in Canary Wharf in London that it was unable to use. The subletting deal with WeWork recoups an undisclosed amount of those costs but EU budget documents record that at least \u20ac62m has been paid to the US firm in an attempt to make the deal attractive. The sum covers the costs for 2019-20. The EMA\u2019s efforts to sublet the property had faced rising competition in London\u2019s commercial subletting market as a result of businesses reducing their footprint in the capital in the light of the Brexit vote. But the attraction of the Canary Wharf location was made clear by the company when it announced the lease agreement, describing it as a \u201cdesirable location for our member businesses who are rapidly scaling as well as the large enterprise companies who now represent 40% of our global membership\u201d. A spokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union declined to comment on the costs to the Treasury from the relocation of the London-based agencies. The EU\u2019s budget documents for 2020 suggest that the payment to WeWork will add \u20ac6.5m to the forecasted outgoings to be met by the 28 member states. Nine years after co-founding WeWork, Neumann, 40, its chief executive, and 45-year-old McKelvey, as chief culture officer, are reportedly worth $7bn between them. The company leases large office spaces, divides them up and rents them out out in smaller portions to businesses offering perks such as free coffee and beer. Neumann once said the objective of his company was to \u201cto elevate the world\u2019s consciousness\u201d. WeWork, which operates in 27 countries and is preparing for a stock market flotation this year, is second only to the British government as an occupier of London offices, with more than 275,000 sq metres of space in the capital. The EMA is currently in a temporary building in Amsterdam until completion of the construction of its new premises at the end of the year. The agency\u2019s latest management board meeting heard that that the EMA expected at least one in four of its staff to stop working for it by the time of the final move as a result of the relocation.

The 250-strong force will provide a long-range reconnaissance capability for the United Nations deployment in the troubled African country which has struggled to decisively counter Islamic militants, armed separatists and traffickers. The deployment is likely to place British troops in combat situations, facing risks of ambushes and roadside bombs in remote and hostile environments. The UN is operating alongside a French-led force that has been fighting Islamic militants in Mali for six years. The mission is known as one of the most dangerous undertaken by the organisation anywhere in the world. More than 170 people deployed by the UN have been killed there between 2013 and February. Penny Mordaunt, the defence minister, said it was right that \u201cin one of the world\u2019s poorest and most fragile regions we support some of world\u2019s most vulnerable people \u2026 UK service personnel will work with our partners in the region to help promote peace by combating the threat of violent extremism and protecting human rights in Mali\u201d. Mali, which occupies a key location in the centre of the restive Sahel, was plunged into chaos in 2012 when Tuareg separatists and Islamic extremists joined forces to take control of much of the north of the country.

A third facility at Woodhill prison is reportedly empty.</p> <p>One of the reasons given for the low number of referrals was poor recording of extremism behaviours across the prison estate.</p> <p>\u201cIt was also thought that selection for the separation centres was quite rigid, with few prisoners meeting the criteria, especially where all alternative management strategies had been exhausted,\u201d the paper added.</p> <p>Prisoners were refusing to engage or cooperate with staff, the paper said, with some being actively encouraged by their lawyers to do so and a number challenging their detention in the centre through the courts.</p> <p>Some prisoners refused to take part in a care plan process because they had been advised against engaging by their solicitors, while others wanted to undermine the success of the centres. Some were happy and did not want to be returned to mainstream prisons, the paper said.</p> <p> Staff at both Frankland and Full Sutton reported that the prisoners felt they were being discriminated against by being placed in a separation centre, particularly as all those separated were Muslim. There were some reports of the men referring to the centres as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d, \u201cGuant\u00e1namo Bay\u201d and \u201cMuslim centres\u201d.</p> <p>All of the prisoners during the study period were considered to be Islamist extremists.

      "bodyText": "Jails-within-jails designed to prevent extremists from radicalising vulnerable prisoners are undersubscribed, staff at the specialist units have told officials. The separation centres were launched in 2017 to keep the most influential extremist prisoners from radicalising the broader prison population but critics have accused them of making ideologies more entrenched and discriminating against Muslims. The Ministry of Justice estimates that about 700 to 1,000 prisoners are considered a risk owing to their extremist views and as of 31 March 2019 there were 223 people in custody in Britain for terrorism-related offences. But staff at two of the three separation centres told MoJ researchers that referral rates to the units were too low. Frankland prison and Full Sutton prison each have the capacity to hold eight prisoners, but between June 2017 and December 2018 were holding only three to six prisoners on average, the study showed. A third facility at Woodhill prison is reportedly empty. One of the reasons given for the low number of referrals was poor recording of extremism behaviours across the prison estate. \u201cIt was also thought that selection for the separation centres was quite rigid, with few prisoners meeting the criteria, especially where all alternative management strategies had been exhausted,\u201d the paper added. Prisoners were refusing to engage or cooperate with staff, the paper said, with some being actively encouraged by their lawyers to do so and a number challenging their detention in the centre through the courts. Some prisoners refused to take part in a care plan process because they had been advised against engaging by their solicitors, while others wanted to undermine the success of the centres. Some were happy and did not want to be returned to mainstream prisons, the paper said. Staff at both Frankland and Full Sutton reported that the prisoners felt they were being discriminated against by being placed in a separation centre, particularly as all those separated were Muslim. There were some reports of the men referring to the centres as \u201cconcentration camps\u201d, \u201cGuant\u00e1namo Bay\u201d and \u201cMuslim centres\u201d. All of the prisoners during the study period were considered to be Islamist extremists. The Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary was reportedly detained in one of the centres. At the time of the study, there had been no referrals made for extreme rightwing offenders. Prisoners in both centres all used the same legal team and were using their solicitors to compare conditions between the two centres, as well as mainstream prisons, and lodging multiple complaints over any differences established, the paper said. There were 56 complaints made at Frankland over an 18-month period and 210 at Full Sutton over nine months. More than half of the complaints at Full Sutton were made by one individual. \u201cComplaints tended to centre around the regime being offered and were often duplicate complaints,\u201d the paper said. \u201cWhen staff provided requested activities (where appropriate), the men did not always engage, suggesting to staff this was an attempt to challenge rather than for a genuine desire to take part. As a number of the men were legally challenging their separation on to the centres, some of the resistance to engaging was perceived to stem from this.\u201d The first centre was opened in June 2017 at Frankland and the second in March 2018 at Full Sutton. Fieldwork for the study was carried out between July 2017 and December 2018. Interviews with officers and managers were conducted, as well as interviews with staff involved in the delivery of psychology, chaplaincy, education, counter-terrorism (CT) and healthcare services.

Swinson, though more open to pacts than her rival Ed Davey, has pledged never to prop up a Corbyn government in coalition, though if a snap election came and a confidence-and-supply agreement with Labour was the route to a new referendum, it would be hard to see the Lib Dems turning down that opportunity.</p> \n<p>Yet many of the Lib Dems\u2019 new members and voters are those who have left Labour, either as members or voters, and might be angered by any deal-making with Corbyn. Or they may be fickle and return to voting for the reds once they feel Labour has truly become the main \u201cremain party\u201d.</p> \n<p>The Liberal Democrats are right to be wary of doing deals. From Clegg-mania to the massacre in 2015 where Swinson herself lost her seat, they know better than most that a hyped revival can easily be followed by a calamitous fall.</p>",

Swinson can also talk passionately about the identity issues that matter to many young Labour voters \u2013 her victory speech rallied against violence against LGBT couples and Islamophobia and antisemitism in both main parties. All those factors would suggest the Lib Dems might find it far easier to capitalise in a snap general election, rather than one held in 2022, when a \u201cre-join the EU\u201d campaign might look far-fetched, with Labour then well placed to talk anew about inequality and division and a Johnson government possibly boosted by the swift decline of the Brexit party, even if a betrayal narrative still exists among the hardcore. An emergency election this autumn would give the Lib Dems a good opportunity to mop up swathes of disillusioned remainers. A recent poll for Politico suggests Johnson repels possible Lib Dem voters, particularly in London, Scotland and the north-west, giving the likely next prime minister practically zero hope of building an electoral coalition that also includes progressives. A snap election could yet pose a dilemma, especially if the Lib Dems make gains and end up holding the balance of power. Swinson, though more open to pacts than her rival Ed Davey, has pledged never to prop up a Corbyn government in coalition, though if a snap election came and a confidence-and-supply agreement with Labour was the route to a new referendum, it would be hard to see the Lib Dems turning down that opportunity. Yet many of the Lib Dems\u2019 new members and voters are those who have left Labour, either as members or voters, and might be angered by any deal-making with Corbyn. Or they may be fickle and return to voting for the reds once they feel Labour has truly become the main \u201cremain party\u201d. The Liberal Democrats are right to be wary of doing deals. From Clegg-mania to the massacre in 2015 where Swinson herself lost her seat, they know better than most that a hyped revival can easily be followed by a calamitous fall.",

      "bodyText": "Twenty-one years ago, on my recommendation, the UN general assembly named 2001 the year of \u201cdialogue among civilisations\u201d, and signalled its commitment to peace and its rejection of war and violence. The Iranian people, despite their own historic grievances and troubled history, opened a hopeful new chapter of engagement and dialogue with the Great Powers (US, UK and Russia). These hopes, however, were dashed by the terrorist atrocities of 11 September, 2001 and their tragic aftermath in devastating wars in west Asia. The catastrophic wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and other interventions in the region exacerbated already extant problems, and paved the way for the growth of international terrorism, civil wars in Syria and Iraq, and the depredations and war crimes still unfolding in Yemen. These conflicts have made the region unsafe and have impinged on security around the world. In the same period, the development of Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear programme became a test of the dialogue on peace. In order to build trust with the international community my administration sought dialogue, and after years of difficult and tumultuous negotiations, President Rouhani\u2019s government succeeded in concluding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) \u2013 known as the Iran nuclear deal \u2013 with six other world powers. Iran has repeatedly declared that it is not seeking to build a nuclear weapon. In addition to observing its obligations under the non-proliferation treaty (NPT), as a gesture of goodwill Iran accepted the JCPOA\u2019s measures to ensure transparent verifiability of the peaceful nature of its civilian nuclear programme. The successful conclusion of the JCPOA was a major achievement which showed that reciprocity and mutual trust between Iran and the E3+3 were not only possible, but desirable. Furthermore, it acted as an important basis on which to build, containing within it the prospect of more fruitful and positive relations between our respective nations in the future. Sadly, Iran was the only country to abide by all the provisions of the JCPOA, while the other signatories have either breached or shirked their responsibilities under its terms. While Iran was playing a decisive role in defeating the Islamic State\u2019s reign of terror, the Trump administration decided to initiate a new round of hostilities against my country by illegally withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, violating UN security council resolution 2231 that the US had itself jointly sponsored, and waging a campaign of economic sanctions against the Iranian people. President Trump is thus punishing Iran and indeed the world community not for violating the JCPOA, but for complying with this UN-sanctioned international legal agreement. By exiting the JCPOA, the Trump administration has moved against the very principles of dialogue, engagement and coalition-building. It has spurned the cause of peace. Unrelenting sanctions and what is effectively a blockade on Iran impose collective punishment on a nation that has done absolutely nothing wrong. The present US administration is ratcheting up tensions in the Persian Gulf, making a conflagration or even a full-scale war between our two countries increasingly likely. But the reimposition of brutal sanctions and renewed military threats will not force the Iranian government or my people into submission. Sanctions, like terrorism, are indiscriminate in their targets and ruinous in their consequences. Today, the Middle East once again faces a crisis not of its own making; a crisis which was both unnecessary and avoidable. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way, and escalating tensions can still be defused. Cool heads must prevail if the region is not going to find itself dragged into yet another violent maelstrom.

      "bodyText": "Kayak with whales Enter the realm of the whales on these multi-day trips Spotting the whales that frequent the waters of British Columbia\u2019s wild coast is an unforgettable experience, but Spirit of the West Adventures takes whale watching to the next level, with multi-day kayak trips into the realm of these magnificent creatures. Group tours depart from Quadra Island, which is just a 10-minute ferry ride from Campbell River, Vancouver Island, with various excursions available. It\u2019s not all about the whales, either \u2013 paddling alongside the towering coastal cliffs and ridges, camping (or glamping!) in the wild, and tucking in to fresh, local food prepared by guides, all make for a once-in-a-life-time experience. Soak in hot springs Soak your body as you take in the views There are hot springs all over British Columbia, so the question is not so much \u201cwhere?\u201d, as it is \u201cwhere first?\u201d For serious fans of a natural soak, the 530-mile Hot Springs Circle Route is a relaxing road trip worth taking, starting in the historic railway town of Cranbrook before winding through the breathtaking Kootenay Rockies with five scenic springs stops along the way. Horseback ride at Canada\u2019s oldest guest ranch Discover the prairies of the pioneers The Flying U Ranch has been at the forefront of western culture since 1849, and as the oldest guest ranch in Canada it\u2019s got some serious historical clout. Book a stay in one of the old west-style cabins on the shores of Green Lake, Cariboo, and settle in for an authentic ranch experience, including unsupervised horseback riding along trails that meander through meadows, forests, and groves of aspen. Enjoy your packed picnic lunch before heading back to the ranch\u2019s Longhorn Saloon \u2013 a charming spot, perfect for quenching your thirst after a long day\u2019s ride. Spend a night in the trees Relive your childhood treehouse fantasy If the fact that every North American child in every North American movie has a treehouse bigger than most one-bed rentals in central London has always irked you, then BC has your back \u2013 because treehouse rentals are a \u201cthing\u201d. The Free Spirit Spheres in Qualicum Beach, for example, hang suspended in the forest, and comfortably sleep two in full-sized double beds, with kitchenettes and porthole windows looking out into the trees. Take that, Kevin McCallister. Ride the seawall An oceanfront adventure awaits Welcome to the longest uninterrupted waterfront path in the world, where Vancouver\u2019s aptly named seawall encircles the city with 17 miles of glorious pathway bordered entirely by ocean. Rent a bike, or a tandem if you\u2019re feeling adventurous, and take in the sights from the comfort of your saddle, passing the futuristic dome of Science World, through the False Creek Marina, under the soaring feat of construction that is the Lionsgate Suspension Bridge and into Stanley Park, home to more than 400 hectares (1,000 acres) of temperate rainforest (yes, the word park is a bit of an understatement) just waiting to be explored. Go grizzly spotting If you go down to the woods today Observing grizzly bears in the wild can be a little tricky, as it is important not to disturb the creatures in their natural habitat. The good news is that bear-spotting tours allow you to do this in a safe and sustainable way, and several operate from the north end of Vancouver Island. Experienced guides will take you to the best spots to watch the famous grizzlies as you explore the island by covered boat or floatplane. The bears usually start \u201cdenning\u201d in preparation for hibernation mid-November, so plan your trip accordingly.

The city is home to seven universities, and it\u2019s got the youthful spirit to prove it. Breweries, cafes, live music and general levity can be found around every corner.

      "bodyText": "Foodies take note, a culinary boom is happening in Halifax right now, and the land is linked to everything. Visitors can expect to find ciders made with robust heritage apples, beers infused with locally grown blueberries, and of course, seafood everywhere, including some of the best lobsters to be found on the North American Atlantic coastline. The city is home to seven universities, and it\u2019s got the youthful spirit to prove it. Breweries, cafes, live music and general levity can be found around every corner. Here are a few neighbourhoods and nearby regions that visitors shouldn\u2019t miss to get a true taste of Canada\u2019s most playful port city, a destination that\u2019s only a six-hour flight from the UK. The North End One of the city\u2019s oldest neighbourhoods, the North End has been revived and transformed of late. The streets are an eclectic mix of colourful saltbox houses, old industrial warehouses and hip restaurants serving up craft beer, local wines and creative fare. The 2 Crows Brewing Co; colourful houses and businesses in the North End For a casual afternoon pint in the summer, there\u2019s nowhere better than the patio at Good Robot Brewing Company, where there is a rotating cast of all-star brews on the go and the vibe is always friendly and fun. The small but funky 2 Crows Brewing Co also has 12 taps and a brand new reveal every Saturday. Bar manager Mitch Gilbert recommends the Pollyanna Wild Northeast IPA, a juicy, tropical, bitter IPA that\u2019s been flying off the shelves. \u201cWe propagate and grow our own yeast grains,\u201d says Gilbert. \u201cThen we add fruits sourced from Nova Scotia and malt from neighbouring Prince Edward Island. The results yield a quite extensive selection of barrel-aged beers.\u201d Edna serves locally sourced (and foraged) food For an unforgettable brunch, check out Edna, the bright and airy neighbourhood favourite, full of foraged wildflowers, a wide selection of beers and ciders, and some of the city\u2019s best steaks, burgers and seafood. Later in the day, visit Field Guide \u2013 it\u2019s just across the way and the perfect place to start off an evening. Try exquisitely crafted cocktails while enjoying the sharing menu that changes according to season. Popular with visitors and locals alike, Bar Kismet will complete your visit to Halifax, but you\u2019ll need to book ahead or queue. Recently voted the 15th best restaurant in all of Canada, Bar Kismet gets everything right, nailing famous east-coast hospitality with stylish minimalism and exceptional seafood dishes. Award-winning bartender Cooper Tardivel recommends the signature cocktail, Return of the Sumac, paired with the popular appetiser ahi tartare and allumettes fries. Finally, the hidden gem Water and Bone offers up rotating taps of all-local ciders and beers, excellent happy-hour specials, a sweet back patio and insanely popular noodle bowls (with house-made noodles). Downtown and the Halifax waterfront Citadel Hill strategically overlooks Halifax harbour and is what enticed the British military here in 1749. It\u2019s worth a visit, and not only for the view from the top. From there, head downtown, stopping for a stroll in the Public Gardens. Don\u2019t miss the amazing Halifax Central Library, a cultural hub with award-winning architecture and two excellent cafes inside. Walking on the Halifax waterfront; try Lot Six for local seafood and cocktails Head to Argyle Street for a bite or a pint or two after a day of exploring the city. The strip is one of Halifax\u2019s nightlife hubs, where patios line both sides of the pedestrian-only zone. East of Grafton has a lovely little outdoor terrace that\u2019s popular for lunch and alfresco dinner in the warmer months. Farther down, the elegant Lot Six stands out when it comes to local seafood dishes and cocktails, while The Five Fishermen offers up inspired seafood with an upscale casual atmosphere. For traditional east-coast nightlife, try Durty Nelly\u2019s, while the Carleton is a must for live music in a cosy, friendly atmosphere. On the waterfront, a favourite place for a dinner date is The Bicycle Thief. Think incredible house-made pasta tossed with melt in your mouth scallops, sublime red wine and candlelit tables right beside the water. For afternoon pints by the water check out the Stubborn Goat Beer Garden where, as they say, beer tastes better by the ocean. Dartmouth Once at the Halifax waterfront, it\u2019s easy to catch the ferry across the harbour to downtown Dartmouth, which is developing its own hip little collection of bars and restaurants. Heading up the local favourites is the wildly popular Canteen, conveniently located only steps away from the ferry terminal. There\u2019s also the casual Battery Park, offering a slew of craft beers and home to Ace Burger Co, voted the best burgers in Halifax for several years running. For coffee, hit up Two If By Sea, the bright and friendly neighbourhood cafe that\u2019s next door. Battery Park in Dartmouth serves a range of craft beers - get there by ferry from Halifax Annapolis Valley Visitors to Halifax should also consider a trip to Nova Scotia\u2019s wine country \u2013 it\u2019s just an hour from the city. Leading the way is Lightfoot &amp; Wolfville Vineyards, a biodynamic, organic winery with strong Acadian roots. Owner Rachel Lightfoot\u2019s family has been farming in the valley for eight generations, creating German-style wines including riesling and pinot noir. \u201cFor us, being in tune with the land means being constantly connected to the past and future generations,\u201d she says. Lightfoot recommends trying their bestseller, the Terroir Series Scheurebe. \u201cNova Scotia\u2019s ocean-influenced cool climate provides freshness and energy, melding with the inherent aromatic intensity of the scheurebe grape to create a truly unique wine,\u201d she says. Another notable favourite is Luckett Vineyards. Pete Luckett is a transplanted Brit who emigrated to Nova Scotia and became a local celebrity. The restaurant is highly recommended, especially the charcuterie board. For beer lovers, Church Brewing Company offers an exceptional collection of craft beers and ciders and locally sourced hearty meals. The Annapolis Valley is wine country. Vineyards to visit include Lightfoot &amp; Wolfville (top) and Luckett Vineyards Tatamagouche, Northumberland shore The area surrounding Tatamagouche boasts several beaches, and because the Trans Canada Trail runs through it, visitors can walk, bike or run their way through town. The village, just under two hours from Halifax by car, is also home to the popular Tatamagouche Brewing Co.

South shore The idyllic seaside villages of Mahone Bay, Peggy\u2019s Cove, Chester and Old Town Lunenburg, a Unesco world heritage site, make up the south shore, and a scenic coastal drive to visit all four is one of the highlights of a visit to the region. For a self-guided tour, rent a car and enjoy the drive at your leisure, exploring the colourful seaside towns along the way.

      "bodyText": "Time for a recap: President Donald Trump has fired another broadside at the Federal Reserve, demanding that US interest rates are lowered. Trump is pushing for a sharp cut in borrowing costs, claiming that the Fed should be blamed if the American economy turns sour. A leading Democratic senator, Elizabeth Warren, has warned that a downturn is coming - and that Trump is to blame. She wrote that \u201cWarning lights are flashing. Whether it\u2019s this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high \u2014 and growing.\u201d UK think tank NIESR has predicted that Britain\u2019s economy could already be in recession. It has also warned that a disorderly no-deal Brexit would cause a severe downturn - the equivalent of pouring cement into the wheels of the economy. The pound has been pulled down by worries that Britain could leave the EU without a deal. Sterling is trading below $1.25 tonight, with analysts predicting further losses in the run-up to the 31 October deadline. Goodnight.... Heads up Volvo drivers: Half a million vehicles are being recalled for an urgent fix, due to a problem that could cause an engine fire. Aviation news: Credit rating agency Fitch has cut its outlook on Boeing\u2019s debt from stable to negative, due to uncertainty over its 737 Max plane. Fitch says the 737 Max (currently grounded after two fatal crashes) will remain a concern to the wider aviation sector next year, and hurt Boeing\u2019s operating margins for several years. Shares in Boeing have dropped 1%. Energy news: Oil giant BP has signed up to a joint venture to create ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil. Under the $775m scheme, BP will combine its Brazilian biofuels and biopower ventures with similar assets owned by US agricultural trader Bunge. The new group, called BP Bunge Bioenergia, will have 11 biofuels mills in Brazil, capable of producing both ethanol and sugar. The move is part of BP\u2019s push away from fossil fuels -- timely, given tensions in the Gulf, and pressure to tackle the climate emergency. CEO Bob Dudley says: Biofuels will be an essential part of delivering the energy transition. Brazil is leading the way in showing how they can be used at scale, reducing emissions from transport.\u201d Heads-up: The South China Morning Post is reporting that US officials will return to Beijing for fresh talks on a trade deal. They say an American delegation led by trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin are set to meet Vice-Premier Liu He. This would be their first meeting since May, when talks broke down and Donald Trump hiked tariffs on $200bn of Chinese imports. More here. One of Donald Trump\u2019s potential rivals for the White House, Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren, has warned that the US economy is at risk of a serious downturn. But rather than blaming the Federal Reserve, Warren says Trump\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d actions could be responsible. In a blogpost, she warns: Warning lights are flashing. Whether it\u2019s this year or next year, the odds of another economic downturn are high \u2014 and growing,\u201d \u201cThe country\u2019s economic foundation is fragile. A single shock could bring it all down. And the Trump Administration\u2019s reckless behavior is increasing the odds of just such a shock.\u201d She cites the slowdown in manufacturing, and worries that America could hit its debt ceiling soon. America\u2019s economy has been outpacing other advanced countries in recent years, growing by 3.1% in 2018 (more than twice as fas as the UK). But the slowdown in Europe and the damage caused by the trade war with China could be hurting, just as the boost from Trump\u2019s tax cuts fades. Donald Trump\u2019s frequent attacks on the Federal Reserve are already undermining the bank\u2019s reputation for independence. Investors must now calculate whether the Fed will act purely in line with its mandate, based on the data, or whether criticism from the tweeter-in-chief will sway policymakers. The Bond Vigilantes team at M&amp;G, the City asset managers, point out that undermining central bankers can end badly: Over in Washington, Donald Trump has renewed his campaign for US interest rates to be cut, with a fresh volley of tweets criticising the Federal Reserve. Trump is arguing that the Fed has hurt the economy by raising rates too high -- perhaps concerned that this Friday\u2019s GDP report will show the US economy has slowed? He also claims that rates are MUCH too high. That sounds like a call for the Fed to cut aggressively, perhaps by 50 basis points? (the markets currently expect a 25bps cut next week). Trump\u2019s claim that there is \u201calmost no inflation\u201d doesn\u2019t stand up, though. Core inflation rose by 2.1% per annum in June, an 18-month high, and slightly over the Fed\u2019s target. But still, his call for an insurance rate cut may resonate with Fed policymakers, as several have hinted that they favour such a move. The pound has lost more than 5% of its value against the US dollar in the last 12 weeks, as fears of a no-deal Brexit have intensified. UK holidaymakers heading abroad this summer will feel sterling\u2019s weakness. And Michael Brown, senior analyst at Caxton FX, fears there could be further losses in the future: \u201cFor the pound, politics will remain the main focus in the week ahead, with the new Conservative Party leader set to be announced tomorrow. Markets will be focused primarily on the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit plan, with moves towards a no-deal Brexit likely to result in downward pressure on the pound. NIESR\u2019s warning that the UK could already be entering a Brexit-induced recession hasn\u2019t helped sterling. The pound is now down almost half a cent today at $1.245, heading towards the 27-month lows struck last week. The news that a government minister has quit even before Boris Johnson get a chance to measure 10 Downing Street for new curtains has reminded the City that Britain\u2019s next PM will face the same parliamentary challenges as Theresa May. So with a no-deal Brexit looming, and the economy weak, there\u2019s little love for the pound today. JP Morgan told its clients that Britain\u2019s \u201cchronic\u201d balance of payments problem is a worry: While the trigger for the pound\u2019s slide is the re-rating of hard Brexit risk, the reason GBP has been so sensitive to political risk is the UK\u2019s uniquely vulnerable external position. The UK runs the largest current account deficit of any major economy and has amongst the lowest real yields, especially now that the BoE is priced to ease as the economy contracts, not to hike. Overseas investors are thus not compensated for the maximal level of UK political risk, and without this they have little reason to invest as another Brexit deadline approaches with zero visibility. City investors would, on balance, marginally prefer Jeremy Hunt to replace Theresa May rather than Boris Johnson. That\u2019s according to a survey from The Share Centre, which also warns that whoever wins has \u201cmuch to do to regain personal investors\u2019 confidence\u201d given the negative view of the Conservative government since the 2017 General Election. They say: When asked, given the commitments made, which of the leadership contenders would be best for personal investors, 35% said Hunt as compared to 29% who favoured Boris Johnson. This translated into a preference among those who expressed an opinion between Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson of 51% stating that Jeremy Hunt should be the next Prime Minister as compared to 49% favouring Boris Johnson. The survey also found that just one in seven investors believe the Conservative Government since 2017 has been good for personal investors -- quite a blow to the Thatcherite vision of a share-owning democracy. Here are the key points from NIESR\u2019S new report on the UK economy: Economic growth has stalled and there is around a one-in-four chance that the economy is already in a technical recession. The outlook beyond October, when the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union, is very murky indeed with the possibility of a severe downturn in the event of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. On the assumption that a no-deal Brexit is avoided, the economy is forecast to grow at around 1 per cent in 2019 and 2020 as uncertainty continues to hold back investment and productivity growth remains weak. On the assumption of an orderly no-deal Brexit, the economy is forecast to stagnate, before starting to grow again in 2021. Some loosening of the public purse appears inevitable and we expect public sector borrowing to rise above 2 per cent of GDP, with the possibility of substantial over-runs of the government\u2019s fiscal objectives in the event of a no-deal Brexit They\u2019ve also produced this fan chart, showing how they expect the UK economy to fare over the next few years. Each coloured area shows a 10% probability of coming true (so there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty in the forecast!). NIESR reckon sterling would plunge by 10% under a no-deal Brexit scenario, which would sent it down towards $1.10 against the US dollar. That would be inflationary, driving up the cost of imports. NIESR is painting a dark picture of Britain\u2019s economic prospects, says Bloomberg: The U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union may have already pushed the U.K. into a technical recession, according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. In a gloomy set of new forecasts, Niesr predicted that, even assuming a smooth exit in October, the nation will grow 1% in 2019 and 1% in 2020. There\u2019s an around a one-in-four chance that the economy is already shrinking, the think tank said. The outlook worsens if there a no-deal Brexit, with Niesr seeing the possibility of a \u201csevere\u201d downturn in the event of a disorderly departure. Even if an \u201corderly\u201d no deal exit is secured, Niesr says the economy will stagnate next year, with inflation accelerating to 4.1% as the pound drops about 10%. NIESR says there is a significant danger of a UK recession in the next year. As well as a one-in-four chance that the economy is already shrinking, there\u2019s a 30% danger of a recession in 2020. Professor Jagjit Chadha, the think tank\u2019s director, says: \u201cHowever we look at it, there will not be much economic joy in a no-deal Brexit,\u201d We discover early next month whether Britain\u2019s economy shrank in the second quarter of 2019, as NIESR fears is possible. But to be an official recession, the economy would then also have to contract in July-September -- which is possible, if no-deal Brexit fears hurt business investment and consumer spending. NIESR\u2019s director, Jagjit Chadha, is warning that a no-deal Brexit would \u201cthrow concrete\u201d into the wheels of the UK economy, knocking around 5% off GDP in the long run. In the short term, though, the Bank of England could cut interest rate to prop up growth, he adds. The title of NIESR\u2019s press conference is \u201cEconomic Prospects Deteriorate As New PM Takes Over\u201d, which rather sets the tone for prime minister Johnson (or possibly Hunt). NIESR are outlining their forecasts now... Even if Britain avoids a no-deal Brexit, the economy will only grow by around 1% per year in 2020 and 2021, NIESR estimates. NEWSFLASH: There\u2019s a one-in-four chance that Britain may be falling into a recession, as Brexit uncertainty drags on growth. That\u2019s according to the NIESR thinktank, which is publishing its latest assessment of the UK economy. It warns that the UK would suffer a \u201csevere downturn\u201d in the event of a disorderly Brexit. But if Britain left in an orderly fashion without a deal, the economy would stagnate in 2020 before returning to growth in 2021, it estimates. As NIESR puts it: \u201cThe outlook beyond October, when the United Kingdom is due to leave the European Union, is very murky indeed with the possibility of a severe downturn in the event of a disorderly no-deal Brexit. More to follow.... Morgan Stanley have released some new forecasts on how the pound might fare over the next few months. They warn that sterling could plunge towards parity with the dollar if Britain crashed out of the EU without a deal on 31 October, but could jump back to $1.45 if a deal is agreed, or Article 50 is revoked..... The drop in the pound this morning is providing some support to the London stock market. The FTSE 100 has gained around 0.5% this morning, led by exporters whose overseas earnings are more valuable (in sterling terms) when the pound weakens. Oil producers such as BP (up 2%) are also among the risers. Brent crude oil is continuing to rise, up 2.3% this morning at $63.92 per barrel. That\u2019s a fairly subdued reaction to the escalating tensions in the Gulf, suggesting the markets aren\u2019t expecting the detention of the Stena Impero to prompt a full-blown military clash. The big fear is that the Strait of Hormuz could be closed to international oil traffic. Hussein Sayed, Chief Market Strategist at FXTM, says oil could easily spike by $10 or $20 per barrel if this critical shipping route was badly disrupted. The little reaction seen in prices suggest two things. One, markets do not believe that these tensions will further escalate and two, the ongoing trade disputes will further hit demand while the US supply continues to reach new highs. While fundamentals do support lower oil prices, investors need to carefully watch the developments in Strait of Hormuz. After all, the Strait is responsible for one-fifth of the world\u2019s oil supply, and any disruption will lead to a significant spike in prices. The pound is dipping in early trading, as investors fret about the Brexit crisis. Sterling has dropped below the $1.25 mark, after chancellor Philip Hammond announced yesterday that he\u2019d resign if Boris Johnson won the Conservative leadership battle. Hammond surely faced the sack otherwise, for showing insufficient enthusiasm for Brexit. His replacement will be someone who shares Johnson\u2019s belief that Britain shouldn\u2019t fear a no-deal exit from the EU. Johnson\u2019s latest argument - if man can walk on the moon then the Irish border shouldn\u2019t be a problem - isn\u2019t providing the pound with much support today. Investors are watching to see if Johnson can maintain his position that Britain definitely, definitely leaves the EU on Halloween, as Neil Wilson of Markets.com explains: Watch for a harder tone on Brexit and the very clear message that Oct 31st is a hard date. As previously argued, the reality of parliamentary arithmetic may see this soften in due course. Pound traders will be watching the new PM like hawks over the coming days. Sterling will remain vulnerable to the prospect of a no-deal exit on Oct 31st. Asia-Pacific stock markets have fallen today, dragged down by worries over the global economy -- and fresh protests in Hong Kong. China\u2019s Shanghai index tumbled by 1.3%, closely followed by Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng (-1.2%) while Japan\u2019s Nikkei lost 0.25%. Stephen Innes of Vanguard Partners says the clashes between police and demonstrators is hitting the markets: The Hang Seng is suffering yet another Monday hangover as weekend demonstrations gridlocked Hong Kong again. The pro-democracy protests that began last month in opposition to the contentious extradition bill are showing little signs of abating. The longer these demonstrations persist, the more massive of a toll both in real and psychological terms will negatively imprint on Hong Kong\u2019s thriving financial centre. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Global markets are subdued this morning, weighed down by worries over the global economy, rising tensions in the Middle East, and the prospect of a new UK prime minister. Germany\u2019s finance ministry has cast a cloud over the new week, warning that its factory sector faces tough challenges. In a new monthly report, it said manufacturers are suffering from a slowing global economy, which is hitting demand for exports. \u201cLeading indicators as well as shrinking order books point to a lasting period of economic weakness in the industrial sector.\u201d That\u2019s not an understatement. Earlier this month we learned that German factories had suffered their biggest drop in orders in a decade, down over 8% year-on-year. A reminder that Germany\u2019s economy, once the powerhouse of the region, has been hurt by the US-China trade war and the wider eurozone slowdown. Elsewhere, some investors are sitting tight until they know whether the US Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next Wednesday (the Financial Times is confident they will lower borrowing costs by 0.25%, judging by today\u2019s front page). Such a rate could would please Donald Trump, but might not be enough to brighten the economic outlook. Traders are also watching events in the Gulf closely, after Iran seized a UK-flagged tanker, the Stena Impero on Friday. Outgoing UK PM Theresa May is chairing a security meeting on the crisis this morning, as relations between the two countries deteriorate. Worrying times, and an early test of Boris Johnson\u2019s diplomatic skills.... Concerns over escalating tensions in the Gulf have pushed the oil price up this morning, gaining 1.5% or almost one dollar per barrel to $63.37.",

      "body": "<h2>1. Thor Four is forward-thinking</h2> <p>The inscription on Mjolnir, Marvel\u2019s spin on the weapon of Norse legend, reads: \u201cWhosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\u201d It\u2019s time to update that pronoun.</p> <p>One can quibble about what was the biggest surprise at this year\u2019s marketing bonanza held at the San Diego Convention Center, but Oscar-winner Natalie Portman\u2019s return as the Asgardian hero Thor\u2019s former love interest, Dr Jane Foster, is a top contender. (The character got an \u201cexit, pursued by a lapsed contract\u201d off-screen dismissal earlier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.) Portman isn\u2019t just back for Taika Waititi\u2019s Thor: Love and Thunder, in theaters 5 November 2020, she will appearing <em>as </em>Thor. Not \u201ca female Thor\u201d \u2013 Thor. (The origins of this lay in Jason Aaron\u2019s The Mighty Thor comics arc which began in 2014.)</p> <p>This is not to say the upcoming film is all Portman. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson will be back in their previous roles, hopefully with no one remembering their Men In Black: International debacle. Importantly, a comment Thompson made during the panel that her character Valkyrie will be \u201clooking for her queen\u201d was confirmed later by Marvel\u2019s generalissimo, Kevin Feige, to mean that Valkyrie is the MCU\u2019s long overdue first LGBTQ superhero.</p> <h2>2. Filling out Phase Four</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6daa8b0b7f15a9b066facea96738e8c527758ce2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6daa8b0b7f15a9b066facea96738e8c527758ce2/0_7_3883_2330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence Pugh, O.T. Fagbenle, Rachel Weisz and Scarlett Johansson speak on stage for the Marvel panel in Hall H of the Convention Center during Comic Con.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Pugh, OT Fagbenle, Rachel Weisz and Scarlett Johansson speak on stage for the Marvel panel in Hall H of the convention center during Comic Con.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Marvel\u2019s late Saturday panel began as a victory lap announcing that Avengers: Endgame had officially outgrossed James Cameron\u2019s Avatar (though why anyone other than a stockholder would care is another story) then laid the groundwork for the next wave: Phase Four.</p> <p>In addition to Thor: Love and Thunder, many expected titles were confirmed. Scarlett Johansson stars opposite Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and Stranger Things\u2019 David Harbour in the flashback standalone Black Widow, coming 1 May 2020, and Benedict Cumberbatch will return in the very Stan Lee-sounding Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, out 7 May 2021. In between comes two lesser-known properties with great potential. First off, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, director of breath-taking Cannes drama The Rider, presented her cast for Eternals, releasing 6 November 2020, including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Salma Hayek. Eternals, concerning a group of space deities, was created by \u201cKing\u201d Jack Kirby and even devoted comics readers sometimes shrug to say: \u201cYeah, Eternals is really weird, man.\u201d</p> <p>Additionally, 12 February 2021 was announced as the release date for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. In it, Simu Liu stars as Shang-Chi, a character created in the 1970s as a \u201cmaster of Kung Fu\u201d. The Farewell star Awkwafina has been cast in an unnamed role, but the biggest revelation was Hong Kong legend Tony Leung as the Mandarin, the Marvel villain that Ben Kingsley\u2019s character was posing as in Iron Man 3. The <em>real </em>Mandarin hasn\u2019t appeared in the MCU yet.</p> <p>Feige also announced plans for streaming shows on the forthcoming Disney+ platform, but that\u2019s gonna be junk.</p> <h2>3. Blade is back, and he\u2019s brought Oscars</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"997ca265eb40d5c64432da356ec299909ebd6c0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/997ca265eb40d5c64432da356ec299909ebd6c0a/0_65_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mahershala Aliwears a hat to promote his new movie Blade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mahershala Ali promotes Blade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of Marvel\u2019s pep rally, which already had its assembled devotees clutching their albuterol, Feige found time for one more major surprise. Mahershala Ali, of Moonlight and Green Book fame, emerged from the wings, announcing his forthcoming appearance as the vampire hunter Blade. Ali apparently brought the idea of his playing Blade to the company, who quickly agreed. Of course, the actor is already in the wider Marvel Universe, playing Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes on the now cancelled Luke Cage series, but something tells me they will figure something out.</p> <p>Wesley Snipes played Blade in a trilogy from the late 1990s and early 2000s, eons before the current wave of superhero mania, and no word was given if he will appear in these new films.</p> <p>While he didn\u2019t have so much as a release date or even title treatment to share, Feige, to thunderous applause, shrieks and huzzahs, uttered the names Black Panther 2, Captain Marvel 2, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and, most importantly, considering they were previously Fox properties, Fantastic Four and Mutants, meaning the X-Men. This is never going to end.</p> <h2>4. Patrick Stewart has made it so</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3om4V_-Y0Q\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/f3om4V_-Y0Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Star Trek booked 90 minutes of Hall H time to try and convince nerds to shell out for the fledgeling CBS All Access streaming service. They may have succeeded. After some talk about Star Trek Discovery\u2019s third season and a look Lower Decks, an animated comedy from Rick and Morty producer Mike McMahan (and the first bit of animated Star Trek in 45 years) they brought out the big phasers.</p> <p>Patrick Stewart was positively beaming as he presented a full trailer for the new series Star Trek: Picard. With the exception of a short montage in the 2009 Star Trek film, this represents the first continuance of the \u201cprime\u201d Trek timeline since the franchise ran out of dilithium crystal with the 2002 dud Star Trek Nemesis.</p> <p>Captain Jean-Luc Picard is living in comfort with a dog (named Number One!) at his vineyard in France when trouble comes looking for him. He must return to Starfleet to confront his most hated of foes: the Borg. With him (and no one saw this coming) is Jeri Ryan, reprising her role as Seven of Nine. Also, sending fans into an orbit of pure bliss, Brent Spiner is back, though we will need to wait and see if he\u2019s playing Data, B4 or some sort of android-of-Theseus combination. (Trekkies know exactly what I am talking about, just trust me.) Though they were not at the panel, it was confirmed that Jonathan Frakes (who also directed a number of episodes) will return as William T Riker and Marina Sirtis will do the same as Deanna Troi.</p> <h2>5. Who will watch the Watchmen?</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKq1PRvPJQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1yKq1PRvPJQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019 12-issue collection Watchmen from the mid-1980s remains the go-to title to hand to someone who thinks superhero comics can\u2019t be a worthwhile intellectual pursuit. Zack Snyder adapted it into a middling film in 2009, after other directors such as Terry Gilliam had failed. Maybe not everything should be a movie, many fans suggested. But how about an HBO series?</p> <p>Created by Damon Lindelof (of Lost and The Leftovers fame) this new Watchmen is being called a remix as opposed to an adaptation or sequel. The setting is current and many of the characters are new. Still, the basic premise remains: what if, like, superheroes were real? While that may sound monumentally basic, Watchmen (the comics, at least) is a fantastic and detailed deep dive into the social and political implications of vigilantes running around in dopey costumes, some of them with magical powers. The HBO series looks to have nailed the lived-in look of some of the uniforms, like the grimy threads on Rorschach\u2019s mask. Of note: Jeremy Irons, perfectly cast as Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, star of perhaps <a href=\"http://cdn3.whatculture.com/images/2019/05/819355f0c122ffa7-600x338.jpg\">the greatest single panel</a> in the history of comic books.</p> <h2>6. Reworked Materials</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yuIE1OYnVI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1yuIE1OYnVI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Speaking of HBO reviving a franchise that had a misfire feature film adaptation in the late aughts: prepare for His Dark Materials.</p> <p>The high fantasy book trilogy, which famously raised the ire of the Catholic church, begat the disappointing Nicole Kidman movie The Golden Compass. However, the breadth of a series and a decade\u2019s worth of special effects development looks to offer the scope necessary for this alternate reality story. The setting is an out-of-time quasi-Britain with a hodgepodge of design elements mixing retro-future airships and Oxbridge-style campuses. At the story\u2019s root is a conspiracy to kidnap children featuring Dafne Keen (X-23 in Logan) as a chosen one, James McAvoy leading some sort of fight, Lin-Manuel Miranda brawling in an old west saloon and a group of helpful spirit animals called daemons that include monkeys, snakes, eagles and an armor-plated polar bear. Excuse me, I must immediately renew the HBO subscription I let lapse after Game of Thrones.</p> <h2>7. The urgent desire for high velocity</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSqVVswa420\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qSqVVswa420?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>They made a Top Gun sequel. On the one hand: ugh. Let the 80s die. On the other hand: Tom Cruise is, weirdly, making great movies right now, be they the Mission: Impossible series or overlooked titles like American Made. Also, now that Russia is America\u2019s bad guy again, we need Cruise up there in the sky, fighting for Democracy, or whatever the hell he was doing in the last one. (I mostly remember beach volleyball.)</p> <p>Anyway, Top Gun: Maverick, is directed by Joseph Kosinski. None of his previous films (Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, Only The Brave) have truly connected with audiences or critics, but they all have a delicious visual flare. Top Gun: Maverick reunites Kosinski with his Only The Brave star Miles Teller, who plays Bradley Bradshaw (really), the son of \u201cGoose\u201d from the last Top Gun. Kelly McGillis is nowhere to be found. After all, she\u2019s actually five years older than Tom Cruise. The love interest this time is Jennifer Connelly, a mere nine years Cruise\u2019s junior, which is something of a progressive win by mainstream Hollywood standards.</p> <h2>8. He said he\u2019d be back!</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d84caeabacd25143889a6197fda780faba52e3f7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d84caeabacd25143889a6197fda780faba52e3f7/0_120_4364_2618/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Linda Hamilton at the Terminator: Dark Fate film panel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Hamilton at the Terminator: Dark Fate film panel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chelsea Lauren/Variety/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Terminator franchise went way off the rails in 2009 with Terminator Salvation and just got further mangled in 2015 with Terminator Genisys. (Remember that one? No, you probably don\u2019t.) Hollywood is giving it one last try, however, by going back to the roots. Deadpool director Tim Miller, under what appears to be close supervision of producer James Cameron, looks to have stripped away a lot of the confusing lore to make a fast, loud action picture with Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth in the series.</p> <p>Linda Hamilton (who has been out of the series since the second one) is back with a shotgun spitting out lines like \u201cI hunt Terminators!\u201d and \u201cYou metal motherfucker!\u201d So Shakespeare it ain\u2019t, but it\u2019s great to see her blowing stuff up while cyborgs turn to liquid chrome. Though he did not appear in the footage (or at the Hall H presentation), Edward Furlong was confirmed as returning to the role of John Connor. Furlong\u2019s career has been a bit below-the-radar of late, primarily due to addiction issues, so it is great news to see Cameron and company helping him get back on his feet. Also in the mix, though his appearance is less of a surprise, the former governor of California, one Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger.<br></p> <h2>9. \u2018\u201cAnd watching over them from center Neptune!\u201d\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35c14b2902220c51a131c9e6752ccab678a60431\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35c14b2902220c51a131c9e6752ccab678a60431/0_68_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Russo and Anthony Russo participate in a conversation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Russo and Anthony Russo participate in a conversation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Joseph and Anthony Russo held court with a panel of their own this Comic-Con. They deserved it after pulling off the Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame diptych, grossing more money than many medium-sized nations and bringing smiles to audiences around the globe. They have got a lot on their plate in varying stages of development, but one title in particular stood out, at least to the brothers\u2019 fellow Gen X-ers: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acOnskcyrtA\">Battle of the Planets</a>.</p> <p>Battle of the Planets, also called G-Force, was a chopped-up animated series hastily brought to syndicated television in the US in the wake of the original Star Wars.

      "bodyText": "1. Thor Four is forward-thinking The inscription on Mjolnir, Marvel\u2019s spin on the weapon of Norse legend, reads: \u201cWhosoever holds this hammer, if he be worthy, shall possess the power of Thor.\u201d It\u2019s time to update that pronoun. One can quibble about what was the biggest surprise at this year\u2019s marketing bonanza held at the San Diego Convention Center, but Oscar-winner Natalie Portman\u2019s return as the Asgardian hero Thor\u2019s former love interest, Dr Jane Foster, is a top contender. (The character got an \u201cexit, pursued by a lapsed contract\u201d off-screen dismissal earlier in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.) Portman isn\u2019t just back for Taika Waititi\u2019s Thor: Love and Thunder, in theaters 5 November 2020, she will appearing as Thor. Not \u201ca female Thor\u201d \u2013 Thor. (The origins of this lay in Jason Aaron\u2019s The Mighty Thor comics arc which began in 2014.) This is not to say the upcoming film is all Portman. Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson will be back in their previous roles, hopefully with no one remembering their Men In Black: International debacle. Importantly, a comment Thompson made during the panel that her character Valkyrie will be \u201clooking for her queen\u201d was confirmed later by Marvel\u2019s generalissimo, Kevin Feige, to mean that Valkyrie is the MCU\u2019s long overdue first LGBTQ superhero. 2. Filling out Phase Four Marvel\u2019s late Saturday panel began as a victory lap announcing that Avengers: Endgame had officially outgrossed James Cameron\u2019s Avatar (though why anyone other than a stockholder would care is another story) then laid the groundwork for the next wave: Phase Four. In addition to Thor: Love and Thunder, many expected titles were confirmed. Scarlett Johansson stars opposite Florence Pugh, Rachel Weisz and Stranger Things\u2019 David Harbour in the flashback standalone Black Widow, coming 1 May 2020, and Benedict Cumberbatch will return in the very Stan Lee-sounding Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, out 7 May 2021. In between comes two lesser-known properties with great potential. First off, Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, director of breath-taking Cannes drama The Rider, presented her cast for Eternals, releasing 6 November 2020, including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kumail Nanjiani and Salma Hayek. Eternals, concerning a group of space deities, was created by \u201cKing\u201d Jack Kirby and even devoted comics readers sometimes shrug to say: \u201cYeah, Eternals is really weird, man.\u201d Additionally, 12 February 2021 was announced as the release date for Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. In it, Simu Liu stars as Shang-Chi, a character created in the 1970s as a \u201cmaster of Kung Fu\u201d. The Farewell star Awkwafina has been cast in an unnamed role, but the biggest revelation was Hong Kong legend Tony Leung as the Mandarin, the Marvel villain that Ben Kingsley\u2019s character was posing as in Iron Man 3. The real Mandarin hasn\u2019t appeared in the MCU yet. Feige also announced plans for streaming shows on the forthcoming Disney+ platform, but that\u2019s gonna be junk. 3. Blade is back, and he\u2019s brought Oscars At the end of Marvel\u2019s pep rally, which already had its assembled devotees clutching their albuterol, Feige found time for one more major surprise. Mahershala Ali, of Moonlight and Green Book fame, emerged from the wings, announcing his forthcoming appearance as the vampire hunter Blade. Ali apparently brought the idea of his playing Blade to the company, who quickly agreed. Of course, the actor is already in the wider Marvel Universe, playing Cornell \u201cCottonmouth\u201d Stokes on the now cancelled Luke Cage series, but something tells me they will figure something out. Wesley Snipes played Blade in a trilogy from the late 1990s and early 2000s, eons before the current wave of superhero mania, and no word was given if he will appear in these new films. While he didn\u2019t have so much as a release date or even title treatment to share, Feige, to thunderous applause, shrieks and huzzahs, uttered the names Black Panther 2, Captain Marvel 2, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 and, most importantly, considering they were previously Fox properties, Fantastic Four and Mutants, meaning the X-Men. This is never going to end. 4. Patrick Stewart has made it so Star Trek booked 90 minutes of Hall H time to try and convince nerds to shell out for the fledgeling CBS All Access streaming service. They may have succeeded. After some talk about Star Trek Discovery\u2019s third season and a look Lower Decks, an animated comedy from Rick and Morty producer Mike McMahan (and the first bit of animated Star Trek in 45 years) they brought out the big phasers. Patrick Stewart was positively beaming as he presented a full trailer for the new series Star Trek: Picard. With the exception of a short montage in the 2009 Star Trek film, this represents the first continuance of the \u201cprime\u201d Trek timeline since the franchise ran out of dilithium crystal with the 2002 dud Star Trek Nemesis. Captain Jean-Luc Picard is living in comfort with a dog (named Number One!) at his vineyard in France when trouble comes looking for him. He must return to Starfleet to confront his most hated of foes: the Borg. With him (and no one saw this coming) is Jeri Ryan, reprising her role as Seven of Nine. Also, sending fans into an orbit of pure bliss, Brent Spiner is back, though we will need to wait and see if he\u2019s playing Data, B4 or some sort of android-of-Theseus combination. (Trekkies know exactly what I am talking about, just trust me.) Though they were not at the panel, it was confirmed that Jonathan Frakes (who also directed a number of episodes) will return as William T Riker and Marina Sirtis will do the same as Deanna Troi. 5. Who will watch the Watchmen? Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\u2019 12-issue collection Watchmen from the mid-1980s remains the go-to title to hand to someone who thinks superhero comics can\u2019t be a worthwhile intellectual pursuit. Zack Snyder adapted it into a middling film in 2009, after other directors such as Terry Gilliam had failed. Maybe not everything should be a movie, many fans suggested. But how about an HBO series? Created by Damon Lindelof (of Lost and The Leftovers fame) this new Watchmen is being called a remix as opposed to an adaptation or sequel. The setting is current and many of the characters are new. Still, the basic premise remains: what if, like, superheroes were real? While that may sound monumentally basic, Watchmen (the comics, at least) is a fantastic and detailed deep dive into the social and political implications of vigilantes running around in dopey costumes, some of them with magical powers. The HBO series looks to have nailed the lived-in look of some of the uniforms, like the grimy threads on Rorschach\u2019s mask. Of note: Jeremy Irons, perfectly cast as Adrian Veidt AKA Ozymandias, star of perhaps the greatest single panel in the history of comic books. 6. Reworked Materials Speaking of HBO reviving a franchise that had a misfire feature film adaptation in the late aughts: prepare for His Dark Materials. The high fantasy book trilogy, which famously raised the ire of the Catholic church, begat the disappointing Nicole Kidman movie The Golden Compass. However, the breadth of a series and a decade\u2019s worth of special effects development looks to offer the scope necessary for this alternate reality story. The setting is an out-of-time quasi-Britain with a hodgepodge of design elements mixing retro-future airships and Oxbridge-style campuses. At the story\u2019s root is a conspiracy to kidnap children featuring Dafne Keen (X-23 in Logan) as a chosen one, James McAvoy leading some sort of fight, Lin-Manuel Miranda brawling in an old west saloon and a group of helpful spirit animals called daemons that include monkeys, snakes, eagles and an armor-plated polar bear. Excuse me, I must immediately renew the HBO subscription I let lapse after Game of Thrones. 7. The urgent desire for high velocity They made a Top Gun sequel. On the one hand: ugh. Let the 80s die. On the other hand: Tom Cruise is, weirdly, making great movies right now, be they the Mission: Impossible series or overlooked titles like American Made. Also, now that Russia is America\u2019s bad guy again, we need Cruise up there in the sky, fighting for Democracy, or whatever the hell he was doing in the last one. (I mostly remember beach volleyball.) Anyway, Top Gun: Maverick, is directed by Joseph Kosinski. None of his previous films (Tron: Legacy, Oblivion, Only The Brave) have truly connected with audiences or critics, but they all have a delicious visual flare. Top Gun: Maverick reunites Kosinski with his Only The Brave star Miles Teller, who plays Bradley Bradshaw (really), the son of \u201cGoose\u201d from the last Top Gun. Kelly McGillis is nowhere to be found. After all, she\u2019s actually five years older than Tom Cruise. The love interest this time is Jennifer Connelly, a mere nine years Cruise\u2019s junior, which is something of a progressive win by mainstream Hollywood standards. 8. He said he\u2019d be back! The Terminator franchise went way off the rails in 2009 with Terminator Salvation and just got further mangled in 2015 with Terminator Genisys. (Remember that one? No, you probably don\u2019t.) Hollywood is giving it one last try, however, by going back to the roots. Deadpool director Tim Miller, under what appears to be close supervision of producer James Cameron, looks to have stripped away a lot of the confusing lore to make a fast, loud action picture with Terminator: Dark Fate, the sixth in the series. Linda Hamilton (who has been out of the series since the second one) is back with a shotgun spitting out lines like \u201cI hunt Terminators!\u201d and \u201cYou metal motherfucker!\u201d So Shakespeare it ain\u2019t, but it\u2019s great to see her blowing stuff up while cyborgs turn to liquid chrome. Though he did not appear in the footage (or at the Hall H presentation), Edward Furlong was confirmed as returning to the role of John Connor. Furlong\u2019s career has been a bit below-the-radar of late, primarily due to addiction issues, so it is great news to see Cameron and company helping him get back on his feet. Also in the mix, though his appearance is less of a surprise, the former governor of California, one Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger. 9. \u2018\u201cAnd watching over them from center Neptune!\u201d\u2019 Joseph and Anthony Russo held court with a panel of their own this Comic-Con. They deserved it after pulling off the Avengers: Infinity War/Endgame diptych, grossing more money than many medium-sized nations and bringing smiles to audiences around the globe. They have got a lot on their plate in varying stages of development, but one title in particular stood out, at least to the brothers\u2019 fellow Gen X-ers: Battle of the Planets. Battle of the Planets, also called G-Force, was a chopped-up animated series hastily brought to syndicated television in the US in the wake of the original Star Wars. While footage was primarily from the earlier Japanese series Gatchaman (also called Science Ninja Team Gatchaman), the action was toned down and goofy additions were made, like an R2D2 ripoff called called 7-Zark-7 (a trashcan-shaped robot who lived underwater with his robo-dog pal 1-Rover-1.) A group of space-faring rangers with bird fetishes fought evil in brightly colored ships and liked to spin around in pyramid formation. The later sensation Voltron was heavily influenced by all this, and if you are just the right age there\u2019s a good chance you have been somewhat obsessed with this show that no one else seems to remember. Transmute! What the Russos have in mind for the G-Force (a live action film? an animated series?) remains unknown. All we can say is that Anthony Russo even wore a Battle of the Planets T-shirt to Comic-Con, so he means business. 10. Whither the Snyder Cut Warner Bros, and therefore DC Films, had no presence at Comic-Con this year. While the next Wonder Woman has already been shot, there are a lot of questions still about the rest of that cinematic universe. Making matters worse for the studio is the relentless nagging from some Internet weirdos who won\u2019t let their QAnon-esque fantasies about a stashed director\u2019s cut of the dreadful Justice League movie die. The unproven claim is that its director, Zack Snyder, while grieving the death of his daughter, had his three and a half-hour opus yanked away by an uncaring studio and neutered. (In their defense, the two-hour version that was released is, in fact, awful.) Snyder has effectively encouraged his fans to push for the \u201cSnyder Cut\u201d, and Warner Bros themselves have created a precedent by releasing the \u201cDonner Cut\u201d of Superman II to home video in 2006. What the fans forget is that there are a number of shots with unfinished effects in that version; to revive the snipped Justice League footage and make it look like anything other than a green screen workshop would take a fortune that Warner Bros is very unlikely to make that investment. Still, ads on bus shelters and even from an airplane demanded the release of the Snyder Cut at Comic-Con, proving that even with all this entertainment out there, comic book fans still have too much time on their hands.",

At this troubling moment in America, when vitriolic speech is dominating the conversation, the Guardian and PEN America reached out to high-profile writers and asked them to share inspiring lines from poems or literature about overcoming hatred and racism. Their submissions follow. We hope you, our readers, will add to this collection. You can submit ideas here and we will publish some of your suggestions: Gregory Pardlo Gregory Pardlo, an American poet whose book Digest won the 2015 Pulitzer prize for poetry, chose the first stanza of Negro Hero, a poem by Gwendolyn Brooks published in 1945. The subject of the poem was Dorie Miller, a mess attendant in the US navy at the start of the second world war. \u201cI had to kick their law into their teeth in order to save them. However, I have heard that sometimes you have to deal Devilishly with drowning men in order to swim them to shore Or they will haul themselves and you to the trash and the fish beneath. (When I think of this, I do not worry about a few Chipped teeth.) Pardlo also suggested the poem Won\u2019t You Celebrate with Me, by Lucille Clifton which includes the line \u201ccome celebrate with me that everyday something has tried to kill me and has failed.\u201d Andrew Solomon Andrew Solomon, a writer, activist and lecturer whose books include The Noonday Demon: An Atlas of Depression which won the National Book Award, chose this line from Emma Lazarus\u2019s letter collection Epistle to the Hebrews. \u201cUntil we are all free, we are none of us free.\u201d Min Jin Lee Min Jin Lee, the author of the novels Free Food for Millionaires and Pachinko, which was a finalist for the National Book Award, selected some lines from her book Pachinko. Living every day in the presence of those who refuse to acknowledge your humanity takes great courage. Mira Jacob Mira Jacob, the author and illustrator of Good Talk: A Memoir in Conversations and the critically acclaimed novel The Sleepwalker\u2019s Guide to Dancing, chose an excerpt from the poem Who Will Survive in America? or 2017: A Horror Film by the poet Ashley M Jones, from her book Dark//Thing. All year, I have worked against this feeling, this country, this raging wreck from sea to shining sea. Do you know what it means to wake each morning, to realize your own brown hands aren\u2019t enough to protect you, that the likelihood of any given day being your last one on earth is too high, that we are more likely to find life on Mars than to ever actually fix that fatal likelihood, that we will probably just continue with our meaningless Starbucks orders, fill the house with Nina Simone and call that \u201cwoke,\u201d value furry, collared creatures over our own human kin?

      "body": "<h2>BALE-ING OUT?</h2> <p>Having failed to endear himself to his Spanish hosts by making no effort to learn the lingo, refusing to walk around clacking castanets and showing little or no inclination to eat his dinner at two o\u2019clock in the morning, it seems Gareth Bale\u2019s Spanish adventure is about to come to an end. Despite scoring over 100 goals for Real Madrid, helping the club to a La Liga title, four Big Cups and three Club World Cups, among other shiny pots, the Welshman has fallen spectacularly out of favour at the Bernab\u00e9u, which has become something of a gilded cage for a knack-prone footballer who is paid so much money that most clubs who might be willing to offer him an escape route can\u2019t afford to do so. With three years of a contract worth \u20ac100m left to run and Bale refusing to take a pay cut, his options are \u2013 like The Fiver\u2019s tolerance for Purple Tin \u2013 extremely limited.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/21/zinedine-zidane-says-gareth-bale-could-leave-real-madrid-in-a-matter-of-days-football\">Gareth Bale could be on his way to China as Real Madrid career nears end</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Exactly how complicit Real manager Zinedine Zidane has been in Bale\u2019s weird fall from grace remains unclear, but having decided (or been told) the winger will not feature in his future plans, it came as no surprise that he left the Welshman out of Real\u2019s pre-season tour and told reporters he hoped a departure was \u201cimminent\u201d. Unless you\u2019re Bale\u2019s Mr 15%, that is, who clutched his pearls and swooned like a Victorian lady upon hearing what Zizou had said. \u201cZidane is a disgrace to speak like that about someone who has done so much for Real,\u201d he harrumphed. \u201cIf and when Gareth goes it will be because it is in the best interest of Gareth and nothing to do with Zidane pushing.\u201d</p> <p>Of course it is no secret that playing golf is very near the top of Bale\u2019s list of interests, so much so that he has had the back garden of his Spanish Villa landscaped into an exact replica of Augusta National and spent last night fantasising about a no-holds barred threesome involving himself, Fred Funk and a bearded man from the backwaters of the Irish paradise that is Offaly. And with the sport developing in China, where there are over 600 courses, he may well be tempted to join a club in one of the few countries where clubs playing another developing sport, one he happens to be very good at, can afford to pay his wages.</p> <p>While there is no evidence of any concrete offers from China, where the transfer window closes in nine days, The Fiver can\u2019t help but feel a speculative bid from Shenzhen FC could be in the pipe. While Bale may not be interested in learning Mandarin, looking at great walls or learning to use chopsticks, with its 12 courses and 216 holes, the local Mission Hills golf club could prove an irresistible draw.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cHe hit him full throttle. Harry [Wilson] got a knock on his cheekbone and his eye so that was not too cool. In general, I don\u2019t like overly hard games \u2026 there are rules.

Ray was coach of the Cambridge University football team in the 1990s \u2013 a gentle, kind man who was remarkably good in goal in training despite only saving shots by leaning forward and kind of shouldering them away. His stint with the Blues wasn\u2019t mentioned, but that\u2019s probably for the best. His last match in charge (my first year at university), we lost 0-4 to the Dark Side in the 1998 Varsity Match. (It was, honestly, closer than it sounds. RIP Ray\u201d \u2013 Mark Walsh.</p> <p>\u201cHaving seen Daniel Sturridge shoot, his brother should have known better.

      "bodyText": "BALE-ING OUT? Having failed to endear himself to his Spanish hosts by making no effort to learn the lingo, refusing to walk around clacking castanets and showing little or no inclination to eat his dinner at two o\u2019clock in the morning, it seems Gareth Bale\u2019s Spanish adventure is about to come to an end. Despite scoring over 100 goals for Real Madrid, helping the club to a La Liga title, four Big Cups and three Club World Cups, among other shiny pots, the Welshman has fallen spectacularly out of favour at the Bernab\u00e9u, which has become something of a gilded cage for a knack-prone footballer who is paid so much money that most clubs who might be willing to offer him an escape route can\u2019t afford to do so. With three years of a contract worth \u20ac100m left to run and Bale refusing to take a pay cut, his options are \u2013 like The Fiver\u2019s tolerance for Purple Tin \u2013 extremely limited. Exactly how complicit Real manager Zinedine Zidane has been in Bale\u2019s weird fall from grace remains unclear, but having decided (or been told) the winger will not feature in his future plans, it came as no surprise that he left the Welshman out of Real\u2019s pre-season tour and told reporters he hoped a departure was \u201cimminent\u201d. Unless you\u2019re Bale\u2019s Mr 15%, that is, who clutched his pearls and swooned like a Victorian lady upon hearing what Zizou had said. \u201cZidane is a disgrace to speak like that about someone who has done so much for Real,\u201d he harrumphed. \u201cIf and when Gareth goes it will be because it is in the best interest of Gareth and nothing to do with Zidane pushing.\u201d Of course it is no secret that playing golf is very near the top of Bale\u2019s list of interests, so much so that he has had the back garden of his Spanish Villa landscaped into an exact replica of Augusta National and spent last night fantasising about a no-holds barred threesome involving himself, Fred Funk and a bearded man from the backwaters of the Irish paradise that is Offaly. And with the sport developing in China, where there are over 600 courses, he may well be tempted to join a club in one of the few countries where clubs playing another developing sport, one he happens to be very good at, can afford to pay his wages. While there is no evidence of any concrete offers from China, where the transfer window closes in nine days, The Fiver can\u2019t help but feel a speculative bid from Shenzhen FC could be in the pipe. While Bale may not be interested in learning Mandarin, looking at great walls or learning to use chopsticks, with its 12 courses and 216 holes, the local Mission Hills golf club could prove an irresistible draw. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHe hit him full throttle. Harry [Wilson] got a knock on his cheekbone and his eye so that was not too cool. In general, I don\u2019t like overly hard games \u2026 there are rules. I don\u2019t want to say anything specific about this game because there will be headlines. I want to have a holiday in Spain again\u201d \u2013 J\u00fcrgen Klopp tries to keep a lid on his fresh and funky mood after Liverpool\u2019s 2-1 defeat by Sevilla at Fenway Park in which Joris Gnagon was sent off for booting Yasser Larouci high into the air and out of a rather unfriendly friendly. FIVER LETTERS \u201cI read with not a little nostalgia the piece about Ray Freeman. Ray was coach of the Cambridge University football team in the 1990s \u2013 a gentle, kind man who was remarkably good in goal in training despite only saving shots by leaning forward and kind of shouldering them away. His stint with the Blues wasn\u2019t mentioned, but that\u2019s probably for the best. His last match in charge (my first year at university), we lost 0-4 to the Dark Side in the 1998 Varsity Match. (It was, honestly, closer than it sounds. RIP Ray\u201d \u2013 Mark Walsh. \u201cHaving seen Daniel Sturridge shoot, his brother should have known better. It totally fits that he was aiming for Seville but ended up in West Bromwich\u201d \u2013 Daniel Doody \u201cLindisfarne lyrics are all well and good but might I suggest peppering your coverage with references to Yes? A good entry point would be Tales from Topographic Oceans, a pointless long distance runaround of interminable drudgery that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, especially when viewed in terms of the coherence of prior releases. So, Arsenal\u201d \u2013 Seth King. \u201cLast week life was so simple. Drop The Child at playgroup, cycle to the office, do a day\u2019s work, take in The Fiver over lunch (it comes in around midday over here) and generally enjoy Montreal summer. No more! Now every spare moment, from the commute in the morning to the increasingly lengthy toilet breaks that lead my office mates to think I have some serious digestion issues, is spent Googling what the hell HHAGTFABM is. I can get as far as BM meaning Big Man but that\u2019s it\u201d \u2013 Dave Lloyd. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And you can always tweet The Fiver via @guardian_sport. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day prize is \u2026 Mark Walsh, who wins a copy of Here We Go: Everton in the 1980s \u2013 the players\u2019 stories. NEWS, BITS AND BOBS David De Gea has donned his shades and said that he\u2019d like to be given the armband once he\u2019s signed a new contract and trousered some more cash. \u201cIt is amazing to be captain of a club like Manchester United and defend this badge,\u201d he blathered. Ethan Ampadu has joined Crass Energy Drink Advertising Gimmick Leipzig on loan from Chelsea. \u201c\u2018I\u2019ve been following the club,\u201d he Robbie Keaned. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect step for me.\u201d Dinamo Bucharest manager Eugen Neagoe is in a stable condition after collapsing on the sidelines during Sunday\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Universitatea Craiova. \u201cOne of the best of my career\u201d is how Harry Kane has described his goal from not quite the halfway line in Tottenham\u2019s meaningless friendly against Juventus. \u201cI saw him off his line and fortunately, it went in,\u201d he roared. The Queen\u2019s Celtic will face either Romanian side Cluj or Maccabi Tel-Aviv of Israel should they make it to the Big Cup third qualifying round \u2013 while Wolves and the Pope\u2019s Newc O\u2019Rangers avoided a potential clash in Big Vase. And Manchester City have been accused of being \u201cdisrespectful\u201d and \u201carrogant\u201d by China\u2019s state-run press agency. \u201cTheir appearance in China was nothing more than a commercial obligation,\u201d sniffed an article. City refused to comment but did post this on their website shortly after the criticism. STILL WANT MORE? Southampton will continue to invest in young tyros rather than spend significantly on the playing squad, writes David Hytner. Quiz! Quiz! Quiz! Do you know your Jack Spong from your Tyreece John-Jules? Name the club from the players who have made a rare appearance in this summer\u2019s pre-season kickabouts.

Hill has said she regretted putting her bosses in a difficult position, and amicably left ESPN within a year. She now writes for the Atlantic and has a weekly podcast. Along with the White House call for Hill\u2019s firing, Trump tweeted in October 2017 that \u201cwith Jemele Hill at the mike, it is no wonder ESPN ratings have \u2018tanked,\u2019 in fact, tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!\u201d",

It is understood the charity was aware that Beech\u2019s allegations had triggered Operation Midland, which was launched in November 2014, although he is not thought to have referred to his own experiences during the school talks.</p> <p>He formally resigned and handed in his ID in February 2017. The charity said it had received no complaints about his behaviour while he was volunteering. In total, he volunteered at 33 schools for the NSPCC.</p> <p>The programme\u2019s synopsis says: \u201cTrained NSPCC volunteers and staff deliver an assembly and workshop with the help of our Speak Out Stay Safe mascot, Buddy the speech bubble. Pupils are taught in a lively, memorable and child-friendly way.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an effective way to support your school\u2019s safeguarding duties and links directly to the curriculum. By the end of our visit, children feel empowered \u2013 knowing how they can speak out and stay safe.\u201d</p> <p>Following the verdict, an NSPCC spokesman said: \u201cBeech had no connection with the NSPCC when these offences came to light. Our volunteers are subject to the most strenuous and thorough safeguarding checks.</p> <p>\u201cWe are shocked and appalled by today\u2019s verdicts and hope Beech\u2019s actions don\u2019t prevent other abuse survivors from getting the justice they deserve.\u201d</p> <p>As part of the investigation into Beech for perverting the course of justice over his paedophile ring claims, Northumbria police raided his home in late 2016 and discovered 350 indecent images of children, dozens of which were graded category A \u2013 the most serious level. He had also secretly recorded a teenage schoolboy using the toilet.</p> <p>Software that could disguise \u201cforensic footprints\u201d had been used on devices. Police also found 21 indecent photographs of children hidden behind a calculator app on an iPad. He was charged in June 2017 with four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism.</p> <p>After failing to turn up for his trial at Worcester crown court in July 2017 and going on the run in Sweden, he was eventually extradited back to the UK to face justice after being captured.</p> <p>When confronted with the evidence, he initially lied to investigators and sought to frame his teenage son for the child abuse images, at first pleading not guilty before switching his plea and accepting he was responsible as he was due to face trial in January 2019.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Beech\u2019s role in helping kickstart a charity exhibition highlighting child abuse survivors\u2019 stories, which went on show at City Hall in London, can be disclosed in full for the first time.</p> <p>The Wall of Silence collated survivors\u2019 pictures, stories, poems and mementoes in a display in order to help them \u201covercome the aftermath\u201d of abuse.</p> <p>The wall was also displayed at Avon and Somerset police headquarters in 2016 and was due to be exhibited at the Houses of Parliament last year before permission was withdrawn after concerns were raised about Beech\u2019s involvement.</p> <p>The exhibition was established by the Southmead Project, a Bristol-based charity that provides support to child abuse survivors who have turned to drugs, alcohol or self-harming, but was spawned by Beech\u2019s efforts on social media.</p> <p>Beech used an anonymous Twitter account to communicate with child abuse survivors to collect their images, stories and other content, which he published on his blog.</p> <p>Dr Mike Peirce, who founded and runs the Southmead Project, said Beech\u2019s blog had kickstarted the idea for the wall and he had first started speaking to him in 2015 before eventually meeting him later that year.</p> <p>However, he said the Wall of Silence would be dismantled and he felt betrayed by Beech. \u201cI\u2019m on the wall. As a survivor, I\u2019m devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has triggered trauma and my guess is it would have triggered the trauma with so many other people, their despair.\u201d</p> <p>It all started out positively, Peirce explained. \u201cCarl Beech introduced the online concept of raising awareness of child abuse. From his concept, which he himself had gotten from the beautiful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/05/how-we-made-tower-of-london-poppies-paul-cummins-tom-piper\">poppy field</a> commemorating the fallen, he had followed that idea but came up with a way of victims and survivors of child abuse being remembered too for their suffering.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was a beautiful idea and I looked at it and I thought there\u2019s much more that can be done about this.\u201d</p> <p>Peirce said he had met Beech several times and corresponded with him over email and Twitter. \u201cThe Twitter response was amazingly positive to what he was trying to do.

      "bodyText": "The VIP paedophile ring accuser Carl Beech gave talks to children as young as five about the dangers of abuse on behalf of the NSPCC, it can be revealed. Beech, himself a convicted paedophile after pleading guilty to hoarding indecent images of children and spying on a teenager urinating, volunteered for the charity by delivering assemblies and workshops to young children. At the same time as he was going to police with his false claims about a murderous gang of high-profile abusers, Beech spoke to key stage 1 and 2 pupils at dozens of primary schools in Herefordshire as part of the NSPCC\u2019s Speak Out Stay Safe scheme. The 51-year-old father of one, who was also governor of two schools, volunteered for the NSPCC from November 2012 until July 2015. It is understood the charity was aware that Beech\u2019s allegations had triggered Operation Midland, which was launched in November 2014, although he is not thought to have referred to his own experiences during the school talks. He formally resigned and handed in his ID in February 2017. The charity said it had received no complaints about his behaviour while he was volunteering. In total, he volunteered at 33 schools for the NSPCC. The programme\u2019s synopsis says: \u201cTrained NSPCC volunteers and staff deliver an assembly and workshop with the help of our Speak Out Stay Safe mascot, Buddy the speech bubble. Pupils are taught in a lively, memorable and child-friendly way. \u201cIt\u2019s an effective way to support your school\u2019s safeguarding duties and links directly to the curriculum. By the end of our visit, children feel empowered \u2013 knowing how they can speak out and stay safe.\u201d Following the verdict, an NSPCC spokesman said: \u201cBeech had no connection with the NSPCC when these offences came to light. Our volunteers are subject to the most strenuous and thorough safeguarding checks. \u201cWe are shocked and appalled by today\u2019s verdicts and hope Beech\u2019s actions don\u2019t prevent other abuse survivors from getting the justice they deserve.\u201d As part of the investigation into Beech for perverting the course of justice over his paedophile ring claims, Northumbria police raided his home in late 2016 and discovered 350 indecent images of children, dozens of which were graded category A \u2013 the most serious level. He had also secretly recorded a teenage schoolboy using the toilet. Software that could disguise \u201cforensic footprints\u201d had been used on devices. Police also found 21 indecent photographs of children hidden behind a calculator app on an iPad. He was charged in June 2017 with four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism. After failing to turn up for his trial at Worcester crown court in July 2017 and going on the run in Sweden, he was eventually extradited back to the UK to face justice after being captured. When confronted with the evidence, he initially lied to investigators and sought to frame his teenage son for the child abuse images, at first pleading not guilty before switching his plea and accepting he was responsible as he was due to face trial in January 2019. Meanwhile, Beech\u2019s role in helping kickstart a charity exhibition highlighting child abuse survivors\u2019 stories, which went on show at City Hall in London, can be disclosed in full for the first time. The Wall of Silence collated survivors\u2019 pictures, stories, poems and mementoes in a display in order to help them \u201covercome the aftermath\u201d of abuse. The wall was also displayed at Avon and Somerset police headquarters in 2016 and was due to be exhibited at the Houses of Parliament last year before permission was withdrawn after concerns were raised about Beech\u2019s involvement. The exhibition was established by the Southmead Project, a Bristol-based charity that provides support to child abuse survivors who have turned to drugs, alcohol or self-harming, but was spawned by Beech\u2019s efforts on social media. Beech used an anonymous Twitter account to communicate with child abuse survivors to collect their images, stories and other content, which he published on his blog. Dr Mike Peirce, who founded and runs the Southmead Project, said Beech\u2019s blog had kickstarted the idea for the wall and he had first started speaking to him in 2015 before eventually meeting him later that year. However, he said the Wall of Silence would be dismantled and he felt betrayed by Beech. \u201cI\u2019m on the wall. As a survivor, I\u2019m devastated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has triggered trauma and my guess is it would have triggered the trauma with so many other people, their despair.\u201d It all started out positively, Peirce explained. \u201cCarl Beech introduced the online concept of raising awareness of child abuse. From his concept, which he himself had gotten from the beautiful poppy field commemorating the fallen, he had followed that idea but came up with a way of victims and survivors of child abuse being remembered too for their suffering. \u201cI thought it was a beautiful idea and I looked at it and I thought there\u2019s much more that can be done about this.\u201d Peirce said he had met Beech several times and corresponded with him over email and Twitter. \u201cThe Twitter response was amazingly positive to what he was trying to do. He invited people to send him how they depicted themselves, either a poem, picture, whatever way they wanted. There was enormous variation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had sent in those pictures willingly. He had then put them online.\u201d Peirce said he had developed Beech\u2019s idea into the Wall of Silence, which first went on display in January 2016 in Bristol and the following month at City Hall in London, the headquarters of the Greater London authority. It was due to be exhibited at parliament\u2019s upper waiting hall in April 2018 until concerns were raised over Beech\u2019s involvement. The Tory MP Sir Paul Beresford, the chair of the administration committee, wrote to Peirce informing him that permission had been withdrawn for the exhibition. Without mentioning Beech by name, Beresford wrote: \u201cThis decision was taken in light of the current controversy surrounding the exhibition.\u201d He added that \u201cconcerns have been raised\u201d in relation to the display but that \u201cthe committee\u2019s decision in no way indicates that any judgment has been made by the House of Commons about the veracity of any of the claims made about the exhibition\u201d. Peirce stressed Beech was not a client of the project and that he had not know about Beech\u2019s allegations other than that he had said he was a child abuse survivor. The charity founder, a counsellor with nearly 30 years\u2019 experience, added: \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy. I was taken in by a person. To be completely taken in, I felt extremely gullible. \u201cThe tragedy for me, not just me personally, is that I know the damage this has done and the potential damage it could do to raising genuine awareness.\u201d In all, Beech published 57 blogposts, including one in which he said he was \u201camazed at the almost daily increase in people following me on Twitter\u201d and \u201chumbled by the kind comments from survivors\u201d. He also began writing his own memoirs and spoke at a conference as a survivor of sexual abuse.",

About 13,000 closed between 2001 and 2018, which the industry has blamed on factors including high business rates, cheap supermarket alcohol, the rising minimum wage, the smoking ban and changing social habits. But government figures indicate that, while the decline has continued, the speed at which pubs are closing their doors for good has slowed considerably. Some experts have attributed this to measures that make it easier for communities to oppose developers\u2019 plans to demolish or convert pubs, as well as relief on business rates. There were 42,450 pubs at the beginning of 2018 but 914 fewer by the end of the year, a rate of 76 net closures a month. But 235 vanished during the first half of this year, or nearly 40 a month, according to government statistics. The commercial real estate consultancy Altus Group, which compiled the data, said government measures designed to staunch the flow of pub closures appeared to be having some effect. Alex Probyn, the UK chief executive of Altus, praised Philip Hammond\u2019s introduction of business rate relief for a limited number of smaller pubs in England, which he said had saved them on average \u00a36,052 a year. He also highlighted new rules that allow communities to have their local designated an \u201casset of community value\u201d (ACV), making it harder for the owner to redevelop the site as flats. Once a local council has designated a pub as an ACV, a six-month moratorium is placed on development plans, giving anyone interested in saving the pub time to raise funds to bid for it. John Harrison, from the south Cambridgeshire village of Guilden Morden, was among the leaders of a successful campaign to save the village\u2019s Three Tuns pub, which was due to be turned into residential property. Instead, it is about to throw open its doors again at a launch party in early August. ACV status \u201cstops you being at a disadvantage because of a lack of time\u201d, said Harrison, the chairman of Guilden Morden Community Pub Ltd, which now owns the Three Tuns. \u201cIt freezes the process to enable you to get your act together as a community and raise money to make a bid.

He is suing the Metropolitan police for \u00a31m.</p> <p>Proctor, who left the Commons in 1987 after pleading guilty to acts of gross indecency, told the Guardian: \u201cThis was like no other police operation or investigation ever.

His widow later received compensation from the Met after the force admitted the raids should never have taken place.</p> <p>Brittan died with the allegations hanging over him, as well as a separate claim, which was later dropped, from a woman who said the politician raped her in 1967, when she was 19.</p> <p>In February 2016, Bernard Hogan-Howe, then Metropolitan police commissioner, personally apologised to Brittan\u2019s widow, Diana, for the delay in telling the politician that there was no case to answer over the rape claim.</p> <p>The Labour MP Tom Watson also apologised to Lady Brittan for his role in the case, which had come to light after the rape complainant, known as Jane, had approached him in 2012.

However, the force said no inference of guilt should be drawn.</p> <p>The report drew widespread criticism. The former Tory cabinet minister Michael Heseltine, who knew Heath, said at the time: \u201cI am afraid that there isn\u2019t any evidence; there is just speculation and allegations.\u201d</p> <p>In January 2018, it emerged that the chief constable, Mike Veale, who led Wiltshire police\u2019s inquiry into Heath, was being investigated by a watchdog over claims he deliberately damaged a police-owned phone.</p> <h2>Edwin Bramall</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a29d43f8eea2895984808f1c7e1d7bb833379210\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a29d43f8eea2895984808f1c7e1d7bb833379210/0_775_2668_1600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lord Bramall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Bramall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Neil Munns/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lord Bramall, a 95-year-old D-day veteran and former chief of the defence staff, was also alleged to have attended and participated in the abuse parties.</p> <p>Bramall, who always denied the allegations, was questioned by police under caution, and his home was raided while his wife was suffering from dementia. She died before Bramall was told, in January 2016, that he faced no further action.</p> <p>He later received compensation from the Met over the raid, which the force admitted never should have happened. Hogan-Howe personally apologised to Bramall.</p> <p>Bramall, who retired from the House of Lords in 2013, told a newspaper in October 2016: \u201cAlthough police knew from very early on they had no case to answer, they couldn\u2019t stop investigating because they didn\u2019t want to be accused of not investigating it properly.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Harvey Proctor The former Conservative MP, 72, was alleged to have attended sexual abuse parties organised by a VIP paedophile ring and to have strangled a boy to death. On another occasion, it was claimed, Proctor participated in the rape and fatal beating of a second boy. He was accused of threatening to cut off Carl Beech\u2019s genitals with a penknife before allegedly being dissuaded by Ted Heath and then handing the weapon to Beech as a memento. A third boy was alleged to have been killed in Kingston upon Thames, south-west London, in a staged hit-and-run on the orders of the paedophile ring. Proctor\u2019s home was raided and he was twice questioned by police over the allegations, which cost him his job, before being told in March 2016 he faced no further action. He is suing the Metropolitan police for \u00a31m. Proctor, who left the Commons in 1987 after pleading guilty to acts of gross indecency, told the Guardian: \u201cThis was like no other police operation or investigation ever. It was self-justification and it was a PR campaign and I got caught up in all of it.\u201d Leon Brittan The former home secretary, a key figure in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s government, was alleged to have also attended the group\u2019s sexual abuse parties. Two of his properties were raided in March 2015, two months after his death aged 75 from cancer. His widow later received compensation from the Met after the force admitted the raids should never have taken place. Brittan died with the allegations hanging over him, as well as a separate claim, which was later dropped, from a woman who said the politician raped her in 1967, when she was 19. In February 2016, Bernard Hogan-Howe, then Metropolitan police commissioner, personally apologised to Brittan\u2019s widow, Diana, for the delay in telling the politician that there was no case to answer over the rape claim. The Labour MP Tom Watson also apologised to Lady Brittan for his role in the case, which had come to light after the rape complainant, known as Jane, had approached him in 2012. He apologised for causing distress and referring to Lord Brittan as \u201cevil\u201d, but defended going over the heads of senior detectives and lobbying the director of public prosecutions. Sir Edward Heath The former prime minister, who led a Conservative government from 1970 to 1974 and died in 2005 aged 89, was also alleged to have hosted and participated in the parties where Beech claimed to have been abused. As a result of a separate \u00a31.5m investigation into allegations of historical abuse against Heath, Wiltshire police announced in 2017 that the politician would have been questioned over the claims if he had still been alive when they came to light. Wiltshire police\u2019s report of its two-year investigation, Operation Conifer, concluded that the 40 allegations, including the alleged rape of an 11-year-old boy, would have met the legal threshold to interview Heath under caution had he still been alive. However, the force said no inference of guilt should be drawn. The report drew widespread criticism. The former Tory cabinet minister Michael Heseltine, who knew Heath, said at the time: \u201cI am afraid that there isn\u2019t any evidence; there is just speculation and allegations.\u201d In January 2018, it emerged that the chief constable, Mike Veale, who led Wiltshire police\u2019s inquiry into Heath, was being investigated by a watchdog over claims he deliberately damaged a police-owned phone. Edwin Bramall Lord Bramall, a 95-year-old D-day veteran and former chief of the defence staff, was also alleged to have attended and participated in the abuse parties. Bramall, who always denied the allegations, was questioned by police under caution, and his home was raided while his wife was suffering from dementia. She died before Bramall was told, in January 2016, that he faced no further action. He later received compensation from the Met over the raid, which the force admitted never should have happened. Hogan-Howe personally apologised to Bramall. Bramall, who retired from the House of Lords in 2013, told a newspaper in October 2016: \u201cAlthough police knew from very early on they had no case to answer, they couldn\u2019t stop investigating because they didn\u2019t want to be accused of not investigating it properly.\u201d",

It\u2019s a fascinating little volume about England/ Britain during the Regency period, and some of the towns and cities and places mentioned throughout the novels, as well as the places Jane lived and visited. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s still available to buy as it was first published in 1986 and mine is a secondhand copy. I seem to remember that when I looked it up there were some rather poor reviews online as well, but it\u2019s a decent introduction to Jane Austen\u2019s world and there are many many other books available for more in-depth insights. . . . . . . . . #guardianbooks #culturetripbooks #igreads #whatiread #bookish #bookworm_insta #bibliophile #vscocam #boxhill #nationaltrust #visitengland #visitbritain #travel #surrey #janeausten #janeite #austen #england #hike #walking #hiking #nature #naturelovers #bookworm #bookclub #nonfiction #geography #bookreview</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/chxrlottereads/\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Charlotte</a> (@chxrlottereads) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2019-07-18T07:40:02+00:00\">Jul 18, 2019 at 12:40am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> </figure>",

But the award for teachers is equivalent to a \u00a31,000 increase on average classroom pay, and the government was accused of achieving the \u201cworst of all worlds\u201d by school leaders, who said schools could not afford to deliver a \u201cderisory\u201d pay settlement. Only 0.75% is being funded by the government, which has deemed the remaining 2% \u201caffordable\u201d. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cIt is inevitable that this will result in more cutbacks, and while schools will do their best to implement the increase, we would not be surprised if some are unable to do so.\u201d The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which represents leaders in the majority of schools in England, described it as a missed opportunity to begin to solve the staffing crisis in schools and colleges. \u201cUnfortunately, leaders will have to cut elsewhere in their budgets in order to find the money needed to fund even this moderate rise,\u201d said Paul Whiteman, the NAHT\u2019s general secretary. Schools will continue to determine how staff are paid but the pay increase will be supported by an additional \u00a3105m to be paid through the teachers\u2019 pay grant, said the Department for Education, on top of \u00a3321m already committed for the 2019-20 financial year. The education secretary, Damian Hinds, said: \u201cToday\u2019s announcement of a 2.75% pay rise for teachers, accepting the STRB\u2019s [School Teachers\u2019 Review Body\u2019s] recommendations in full, means that teachers and heads can receive a pay rise above current rates of inflation and have more money in their pockets. \u201cIf we want the best people working in our classrooms then it\u2019s right that we ensure their salaries recognise the vital nature of their work and the potentially life-changing impact they can have on the lives of our children.\u201d His department said the pay award meant the minimum starting salary for a qualified teacher in 2019-20 would rise from \u00a323,720 to \u00a324,373 outside London and from \u00a329,664 to \u00a330,480 in inner London. Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said the announcement would not reverse nearly a decade of real-terms pay cuts for teachers and school support staff. \u201cThis announcement has been made after schools have submitted their budgets for next year, and school leaders and teachers continue to face destabilising uncertainty about their budgets in the years ahead.\u201d The Liberal Democrats\u2019 education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said headteachers would now have to decide which support staff to sack or which basic supplies to cut back. \u201cNo headteacher should have to make these sorts of decisions \u2013 schools should be fully funded and teachers should be paid properly.\u201d Confirming the awards across the public sector, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, said they had been made possible by the work done to rebuild public finances. While hospital doctors will get an average of \u00a31,500, an army corporal on average wages will get an additional \u00a3995 while police constables will get up to \u00a3978 more. Public sector pay rises \u2013 who gets what? Schoolteachers 2.75% Equivalent to a \u00a31,000 increase to average classroom teacher pay and a \u00a31,620 increase in the average pay of school leaders. Consultants and dentists 2.5% Ranges from \u00a3970 and \u00a31,820 for specialty doctors through to \u00a31,940 and \u00a32,630 for consultants. Police officers 2.5% The Police Federation said the pay rise equates to about an extra \u00a31,000 of pensionable salary a year for a constable. Armed forces personnel 2.9% The lowest-paid soldiers, sailors and airmen and women will receive a 6% increase to bring them in line with the living wage. It means new and junior personnel will receive a \u00a320,000 salary while an officer\u2019s starting salary will rise by \u00a3769. Prison officers 2.2% There will be a targeted 3% increase for band 3 officers on new terms and conditions as part of moves to reduce the gap with those on older conditions. Senior civil servants and senior military staff 2% Exceptions that include limiting the overall figure to an average 2% increase will mean a lot less for most members of the senior civil servants\u2019 union, the FDA.",

The child, Beech said, was \u201cpossibly\u201d Martin Allen, the teenager who went missing in 1979 and was never found.</p> <p>The detail was gruesome. He claimed Proctor and another man had tied the boy to a table, with the politician stabbing the child in the arm and cutting his chest and legs. \u201cI tried to untie him, but I couldn\u2019t.

During one abuse party, Proctor was said to have threatened to cut Beech\u2019s genitals with a penknife before handing him the weapon, which he then kept in a \u201cmemory box\u201d for three decades until he handed it over to police. On another occasion, Hanley kidnapped Beech\u2019s beloved pet dog, Heron, as a warning for missing a meet-up with his abusers.</p> <p>In 2014, in an interview with the BBC, Nick, as he was then known, said the abusers were \u201cquite open about who they were. They had no fear at all of being caught. It didn\u2019t cross their mind. They created fear that penetrated every part of me, day in, day out.\u201d</p> <p>Amid political pressure \u2013 led by the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech to talk about his claims \u2013 following the police\u2019s failure to bring Jimmy Savile to justice before his death, Scotland Yard began to investigate in earnest. Operation Midland was launched.</p> <p>Though none of the alleged VIP abusers were named in initial reports, their identities became known when their properties were later searched in a string of police raids.</p> <p>The Metropolitan police officer leading the investigation, Det Supt Kenny McDonald, described Beech\u2019s account as \u201ccredible and true\u201d on TV news bulletins in December 2014.</p> <p>On 4 March 2015, the homes of Proctor, Bramall and Brittan were raided simultaneously. Brittan had died from cancer two months earlier, going to his grave with the allegations hanging over him. Bramall, a war hero, and Proctor were interviewed under caution.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0662c413e5c619d6e587cce879bd0afef2fa46ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0662c413e5c619d6e587cce879bd0afef2fa46ec/374_70_2755_1653/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harvey Proctor at a press conference in August 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harvey Proctor at a press conference in August 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Proctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/20/vip-abuse-ring-accusation-turned-life-into-nightmare-former-mp-tells-court\">gave emotional testimony</a> from the witness box during the trial, telling jurors the Metropolitan police\u2019s high-profile investigation was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and a charade.</p> <p>The late Labour MP Greville Janner, who died in 2015, was also among those Beech accused of child abuse. The accusations were vehemently denied by Janner\u2019s barrister son, Daniel Janner QC, who called last year for Beech to be prosecuted.</p> <p>He told the Guardian: \u201cAs with other distinguished public figures, my late father Lord Janner was the victim of wicked fantasists like Carl Beech. He made his accusations under the cloak of anonymity as \u2018Nick\u2019. Those he accused were named. The time has come for anonymity until charge for suspects.\u201d</p> <p>But Beech\u2019s story began to unravel. Police could not find any evidence to support his sensational claims.</p> <p>In August 2015, Proctor assembled journalists for a remarkable press conference in which he outlined the allegations in lurid detail. Proctor, who left the Commons in 1987 after pleading guilty to acts of gross indecency, defended himself with vigour. \u201cI am a homosexual,\u201d he said, \u201cI am not a paedophile.\u201d</p> <p>The pendulum began to swing. Proctor told the Guardian: \u201cWhat I\u2019d set out to do had been achieved. Up until then the media were being fed scraps of information by the police and Exaro, who were profiting commercially from selling the stories. The police, for evidential reasons, did not want to give the press too much but just enough to keep the pot boiling in the hope that somebody would come forward.</p> <p>\u201cThey were astonished that nobody came forward to corroborate what \u2018Nick\u2019 had said.\u201d</p> <p>In September, the Met took the unusual step of conceding that its officer had been wrong to suggest that it was pre-empting the result of the inquiry by earlier declaring its key witness\u2019s account to be \u201ccredible and true\u201d. The writing was on the wall.</p> <p>In January 2016, it emerged that Beech had given an interview to a 2014 television documentary under the alias of \u201cStephen\u201d in which he alleged he had been abused by Savile.</p> <p>By March 2016, Operation Midland was closed after the police announced no further action would be taken against Bramall or Proctor. Heath had died in 2005. Lady Brittan and Bramall later received compensation from the Met after the force admitted the raids on their homes should never have taken place. Proctor is still pursuing legal action.</p> <p>After Brittan died in 2015, Watson wrote a piece for the Sunday Mirror in which he quoted a \u201csurvivor\u201d \u2013 thought to be Beech \u2013 who he said had told him that the late politician was \u201cas close to evil as a human being could get\u201d. Watson later apologised for the distress his comments had caused and said he would write to Brittan\u2019s widow. During the trial, jurors heard how Beech had used nearly exactly the same phrase to describe Brittan in an email sent to his counsellor.</p> <p>A retired judge, Sir Richard Henriques, was commissioned to review the investigation. His findings, published on 8 November 2016, were devastating for the police.</p> <p>Senior detectives fell for Beech\u2019s \u201cfalse allegations\u201d and then misled a judge to get warrants to search the homes of innocent members of the establishment, distressing them and their loved ones, the Henriques report found.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7a8cb80f532138d0a268ca58028fbde4f0917ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7a8cb80f532138d0a268ca58028fbde4f0917ce/0_189_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The remote property in Sweden that Carl Beech purchased after Northumbria police started to look into his allegations.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The remote property in Sweden that Carl Beech purchased after Northumbria police started to look into his allegations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Crown Prosecution Service/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Police should have spotted that Beech was not credible earlier and halted the investigation sooner, the report added.</p> <p>Northumbria police, appointed as an outside force, began investigating Beech for perverting the course of justice. On 2 November 2016, police searched his Gloucestershire home. An Acer laptop and a MacBook were seized and an iPad found in the front seat of his Ford Mustang sports car.</p> <p>What officers discovered was staggering. <strong> </strong>Beech had hoarded 350 indecent images of children, dozens of which were graded category A \u2013 the most serious level. He had also secretly recorded a teenage schoolboy using the toilet.</p> <p>Software that could disguise \u201cforensic footprints\u201d had been used on the devices. Police also found 21 indecent photographs of children hidden behind a calculator app on the iPad.</p> <p>Beech was charged in June 2017 with four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism.</p> <p>Significantly, the offences ranged over a three-year period from 2013 to 2016 \u2013 during which time he had gone to the media and police with his allegations.</p> <p>It was as he awaited trial for these offences that he moved to Sweden. The only bail conditions imposed were that he was not allowed to contact any witness involved in the case, leaving him free to travel.</p> <p>He purchased the small cabin in Mj\u00f6lan, in the region of \u00d6verkalix, for 200,000 Swedish krona (\u00a317,145) in February 2018.</p> <p>His mother, Charmian, a retired vicar, later went to join him.

It turned out Beech had bought the cabin next to the property she shared with her partner. The community has only about 10 permanent residents, with many houses lying empty during the harsh winter.</p> <p>\u201cHe was just an ordinary, friendly person,\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>Beech had plans to set up a B&amp;B, the Guardian has established. He applied for permission to build four new small cabins to rent out on his plot of land and turn one of the existing outhouses into a fifth for his mother to live in.</p> <p>On 20 February, when introducing himself to staff at \u00d6verkalix\u2019s <em>kommun</em>, which deals with planning applications, he initially gave his name as Stephen, his middle name. On official planning documents he is listed as \u201cCarl Anderson\u201d. Separately, he used another name, Sam Williams, to enter into an agreement for a second property around two hours away in Sleddo.</p> <p>Beech is understood to have returned briefly to the UK to attend a pre-trial hearing at the start of March 2018 before heading back to Scandinavia. He got to work excitedly promoting his venture on social media on a Facebook page called \u201c66 degrees north bed &amp; breakfast\u201d with a succession of posts from April onwards charting his progress renovating the cabin.</p> <p>Patrik Elemalm was employed by Beech to do some plumbing work on a new bathroom at the cabin last spring. \u201cHe introduced himself as Carl Anderson,\u201d Elemalm said.</p> <p>Beech ordered a bath and some taps, but never paid a 52,000 krona (\u00a34,457) bill for the work, according to Elemalm. \u201cHe seemed polite, friendly. I don\u2019t understand how a person like that could be a crook,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Per Andersson, who owns a carpentry firm, was also left out of pocket to the tune of 100,000 krona after one of his workmen helped renovate the cabin. He has given up all hope of retrieving the cash.</p> <p>Meanwhile, as a friendly gesture, Isaksson invited Beech to her wedding on 7 July, and he accepted. But he never turned up. Four days earlier, the CPS had announced it was charging Beech with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud after finding \u201csufficient evidence\u201d following Northumbria police\u2019s investigation. One of the charges related to \u00a322,000 Beech had received from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority because of his abuse claims. It later transpired that Beech \u2013 who along with his wife was at one stage \u00a370,000 in debt \u2013 had used some of the money to put down a deposit on a \u00a334,000 white Ford Mustang convertible sports car.</p> <p>Another charge detailed how he had set up and sent false information from a fake email account for a fictitious man called \u201cFred\u201d whom he had named as being present when he was abused.</p> <p>Isaksson believes she last saw Beech on 27 July. \u201cAt first we just thought he had gone on holiday and then he never came back,\u201d Isaksson said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"859172461c26f338c86d7a8a47ff46e2393225eb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/859172461c26f338c86d7a8a47ff46e2393225eb/0_263_5976_3586/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patrik Elemalm.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patrik Elemalm.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sean Smith/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 31 July, Beech was due to attend court in Worcester to stand trial over the child abuse images. He failed to show up. A European arrest warrant was issued, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian. It lists 19 offences in total.</p> <p>The warrant details how Beech made allegations to police from late 2012 to 2016 that \u201cbetween 1975 and 1984, when he was aged between seven and 16, he was subjected to numerous sexual offences and offences of violence by military personnel, politicians, a television presenter and other unidentified men at various locations. He also alleged that he had witnessed the murders of three boys.\u201d</p> <p>The warrant said the \u201cprovably false\u201d allegations were \u201cdeliberate, prolonged and detailed, and accompanied by the seeking of reassurance that the police were not only taking them seriously but they were actively investigating them\u201d.</p> <p>Beech managed to evade capture for two months, travelling across Sweden before he was finally arrested at Gothenburg train station on 1 October.</p> <p>In two interviews with Swedish police, transcripts of which have been seen by the Guardian, he said he had been \u201cwandering around in various places\u201d including the far north of the country since August.</p> <p>Later that month, he was extradited back to the UK to await trial. Beech initially lied to investigators and sought to frame his teenage son for the child abuse images, at first pleading not guilty before switching his plea and accepting he was responsible. Asked during the Newcastle trial why he had lied, Beech said: \u201cBecause I was totally ashamed of what I had done. I couldn\u2019t admit it to myself. I was in denial.\u201d</p> <p>Beech, who had been the serial accuser, was now the accused.</p> <p>It was years earlier, in late 2012, that Beech had first contacted police claiming his stepfather, Raymond, and Savile had abused him as a child.

      "bodyText": "On a snowy bank overlooking an ice-covered river in the tiny, remote northern Swedish hamlet of Mj\u00f6lan stands a small burgundy cabin. It would be unremarkable, were it not for one fact. For six months last year it housed the man who triggered an ill-fated multimillion-pound police inquiry thousands of miles away in Britain that sent shockwaves through the heart of the political establishment. It was, the Guardian discovered, the bolthole of 51-year-old Carl Beech \u2013 known as \u201cNick\u201d before a judge stripped him of anonymity last year \u2013 whose claims of a Westminster VIP paedophile ring, supposedly responsible for the murder of three boys, sparked a \u00a32m Scotland Yard investigation that closed in 2016 without a single arrest. Beech \u2013 assuming different identities \u2013 moved to Sweden last year to set up a B&amp;B, before going on the run from police for more than two months. Beech, a father of one, has been found guilty of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one of fraud over his false claims and faces a lengthy prison sentence. But how did it get to this point? In 2014, Beech, a former nurse, claimed his stepfather Raymond, an army major, had sexually abused him as a child in the late 1970s and 80s, ferrying him to parties at exclusive private members\u2019 clubs, Dolphin Square in London, and other locations \u2013 including swimming pools \u2013 attended by the former prime minister Sir Edward Heath, the former home secretary Leon Brittan, the then chief of the defence staff Lord Bramall, the ex-MI5 chief Sir Michael Hanley, as well as the former Tory MP Harvey Proctor, among others. The allegations, later accepted as completely false, peddled via the now-discredited Exaro news agency to the Sunday People, which detailed them in a series of stories from July 2014 onwards, were fantastical. \u201cVIP paedo ring sensation,\u201d the tabloid boasted on its front page in one story. Exaro shut down in 2016, but relaunched last year under new ownership. Children were claimed to have been sexually abused, raped, tortured and murdered by the gang. During his 10-week trial at Newcastle crown court, Beech stood by his story and gave a vivid account of three alleged child murders, insisting: \u201cI was there and I know it took place.\u201d One child, a friend called \u201cScott\u201d, was apparently deliberately mown down by the gang in a revenge hit-and-run attack after Beech claimed to have been warned by Hanley not to have any friends. He also tearfully told the court he had tried to save another boy who he claimed was raped and strangled by Proctor. The child, Beech said, was \u201cpossibly\u201d Martin Allen, the teenager who went missing in 1979 and was never found. The detail was gruesome. He claimed Proctor and another man had tied the boy to a table, with the politician stabbing the child in the arm and cutting his chest and legs. \u201cI tried to untie him, but I couldn\u2019t. There was a lot of blood. He just kept saying sorry,\u201d Beech told the court. On a third occasion, Beech alleged that Hanley had ordered him and three other boys to choose which of them was to die at an abuse session before a child was beaten to death. If most of his story sounded beyond belief, parts of it would have challenged even the most inventive of fiction writers. During one abuse party, Proctor was said to have threatened to cut Beech\u2019s genitals with a penknife before handing him the weapon, which he then kept in a \u201cmemory box\u201d for three decades until he handed it over to police. On another occasion, Hanley kidnapped Beech\u2019s beloved pet dog, Heron, as a warning for missing a meet-up with his abusers. In 2014, in an interview with the BBC, Nick, as he was then known, said the abusers were \u201cquite open about who they were. They had no fear at all of being caught. It didn\u2019t cross their mind. They created fear that penetrated every part of me, day in, day out.\u201d Amid political pressure \u2013 led by the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, who met Beech to talk about his claims \u2013 following the police\u2019s failure to bring Jimmy Savile to justice before his death, Scotland Yard began to investigate in earnest. Operation Midland was launched. Though none of the alleged VIP abusers were named in initial reports, their identities became known when their properties were later searched in a string of police raids. The Metropolitan police officer leading the investigation, Det Supt Kenny McDonald, described Beech\u2019s account as \u201ccredible and true\u201d on TV news bulletins in December 2014. On 4 March 2015, the homes of Proctor, Bramall and Brittan were raided simultaneously. Brittan had died from cancer two months earlier, going to his grave with the allegations hanging over him. Bramall, a war hero, and Proctor were interviewed under caution. Proctor gave emotional testimony from the witness box during the trial, telling jurors the Metropolitan police\u2019s high-profile investigation was a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d and a charade. The late Labour MP Greville Janner, who died in 2015, was also among those Beech accused of child abuse. The accusations were vehemently denied by Janner\u2019s barrister son, Daniel Janner QC, who called last year for Beech to be prosecuted. He told the Guardian: \u201cAs with other distinguished public figures, my late father Lord Janner was the victim of wicked fantasists like Carl Beech. He made his accusations under the cloak of anonymity as \u2018Nick\u2019. Those he accused were named. The time has come for anonymity until charge for suspects.\u201d But Beech\u2019s story began to unravel. Police could not find any evidence to support his sensational claims. In August 2015, Proctor assembled journalists for a remarkable press conference in which he outlined the allegations in lurid detail. Proctor, who left the Commons in 1987 after pleading guilty to acts of gross indecency, defended himself with vigour. \u201cI am a homosexual,\u201d he said, \u201cI am not a paedophile.\u201d The pendulum began to swing. Proctor told the Guardian: \u201cWhat I\u2019d set out to do had been achieved. Up until then the media were being fed scraps of information by the police and Exaro, who were profiting commercially from selling the stories. The police, for evidential reasons, did not want to give the press too much but just enough to keep the pot boiling in the hope that somebody would come forward. \u201cThey were astonished that nobody came forward to corroborate what \u2018Nick\u2019 had said.\u201d In September, the Met took the unusual step of conceding that its officer had been wrong to suggest that it was pre-empting the result of the inquiry by earlier declaring its key witness\u2019s account to be \u201ccredible and true\u201d. The writing was on the wall. In January 2016, it emerged that Beech had given an interview to a 2014 television documentary under the alias of \u201cStephen\u201d in which he alleged he had been abused by Savile. By March 2016, Operation Midland was closed after the police announced no further action would be taken against Bramall or Proctor. Heath had died in 2005. Lady Brittan and Bramall later received compensation from the Met after the force admitted the raids on their homes should never have taken place. Proctor is still pursuing legal action. After Brittan died in 2015, Watson wrote a piece for the Sunday Mirror in which he quoted a \u201csurvivor\u201d \u2013 thought to be Beech \u2013 who he said had told him that the late politician was \u201cas close to evil as a human being could get\u201d. Watson later apologised for the distress his comments had caused and said he would write to Brittan\u2019s widow. During the trial, jurors heard how Beech had used nearly exactly the same phrase to describe Brittan in an email sent to his counsellor. A retired judge, Sir Richard Henriques, was commissioned to review the investigation. His findings, published on 8 November 2016, were devastating for the police. Senior detectives fell for Beech\u2019s \u201cfalse allegations\u201d and then misled a judge to get warrants to search the homes of innocent members of the establishment, distressing them and their loved ones, the Henriques report found. Police should have spotted that Beech was not credible earlier and halted the investigation sooner, the report added. Northumbria police, appointed as an outside force, began investigating Beech for perverting the course of justice. On 2 November 2016, police searched his Gloucestershire home. An Acer laptop and a MacBook were seized and an iPad found in the front seat of his Ford Mustang sports car. What officers discovered was staggering. Beech had hoarded 350 indecent images of children, dozens of which were graded category A \u2013 the most serious level. He had also secretly recorded a teenage schoolboy using the toilet. Software that could disguise \u201cforensic footprints\u201d had been used on the devices. Police also found 21 indecent photographs of children hidden behind a calculator app on the iPad. Beech was charged in June 2017 with four counts of making indecent photographs of children, one count of possessing indecent images of children and one count of voyeurism. Significantly, the offences ranged over a three-year period from 2013 to 2016 \u2013 during which time he had gone to the media and police with his allegations. It was as he awaited trial for these offences that he moved to Sweden. The only bail conditions imposed were that he was not allowed to contact any witness involved in the case, leaving him free to travel. He purchased the small cabin in Mj\u00f6lan, in the region of \u00d6verkalix, for 200,000 Swedish krona (\u00a317,145) in February 2018. His mother, Charmian, a retired vicar, later went to join him. She sold the \u00a3200,000 Shropshire home she had been sharing with her son in May 2018. Sonja Isaksson, 57, remembers first meeting Beech in March last year. It turned out Beech had bought the cabin next to the property she shared with her partner. The community has only about 10 permanent residents, with many houses lying empty during the harsh winter. \u201cHe was just an ordinary, friendly person,\u201d she recalled. Beech had plans to set up a B&amp;B, the Guardian has established. He applied for permission to build four new small cabins to rent out on his plot of land and turn one of the existing outhouses into a fifth for his mother to live in. On 20 February, when introducing himself to staff at \u00d6verkalix\u2019s kommun, which deals with planning applications, he initially gave his name as Stephen, his middle name. On official planning documents he is listed as \u201cCarl Anderson\u201d. Separately, he used another name, Sam Williams, to enter into an agreement for a second property around two hours away in Sleddo. Beech is understood to have returned briefly to the UK to attend a pre-trial hearing at the start of March 2018 before heading back to Scandinavia. He got to work excitedly promoting his venture on social media on a Facebook page called \u201c66 degrees north bed &amp; breakfast\u201d with a succession of posts from April onwards charting his progress renovating the cabin. Patrik Elemalm was employed by Beech to do some plumbing work on a new bathroom at the cabin last spring. \u201cHe introduced himself as Carl Anderson,\u201d Elemalm said. Beech ordered a bath and some taps, but never paid a 52,000 krona (\u00a34,457) bill for the work, according to Elemalm. \u201cHe seemed polite, friendly. I don\u2019t understand how a person like that could be a crook,\u201d he said. Per Andersson, who owns a carpentry firm, was also left out of pocket to the tune of 100,000 krona after one of his workmen helped renovate the cabin. He has given up all hope of retrieving the cash. Meanwhile, as a friendly gesture, Isaksson invited Beech to her wedding on 7 July, and he accepted. But he never turned up. Four days earlier, the CPS had announced it was charging Beech with 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud after finding \u201csufficient evidence\u201d following Northumbria police\u2019s investigation. One of the charges related to \u00a322,000 Beech had received from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority because of his abuse claims. It later transpired that Beech \u2013 who along with his wife was at one stage \u00a370,000 in debt \u2013 had used some of the money to put down a deposit on a \u00a334,000 white Ford Mustang convertible sports car. Another charge detailed how he had set up and sent false information from a fake email account for a fictitious man called \u201cFred\u201d whom he had named as being present when he was abused. Isaksson believes she last saw Beech on 27 July. \u201cAt first we just thought he had gone on holiday and then he never came back,\u201d Isaksson said. On 31 July, Beech was due to attend court in Worcester to stand trial over the child abuse images. He failed to show up. A European arrest warrant was issued, a copy of which has been seen by the Guardian. It lists 19 offences in total. The warrant details how Beech made allegations to police from late 2012 to 2016 that \u201cbetween 1975 and 1984, when he was aged between seven and 16, he was subjected to numerous sexual offences and offences of violence by military personnel, politicians, a television presenter and other unidentified men at various locations. He also alleged that he had witnessed the murders of three boys.\u201d The warrant said the \u201cprovably false\u201d allegations were \u201cdeliberate, prolonged and detailed, and accompanied by the seeking of reassurance that the police were not only taking them seriously but they were actively investigating them\u201d. Beech managed to evade capture for two months, travelling across Sweden before he was finally arrested at Gothenburg train station on 1 October. In two interviews with Swedish police, transcripts of which have been seen by the Guardian, he said he had been \u201cwandering around in various places\u201d including the far north of the country since August. Later that month, he was extradited back to the UK to await trial. Beech initially lied to investigators and sought to frame his teenage son for the child abuse images, at first pleading not guilty before switching his plea and accepting he was responsible. Asked during the Newcastle trial why he had lied, Beech said: \u201cBecause I was totally ashamed of what I had done. I couldn\u2019t admit it to myself. I was in denial.\u201d Beech, who had been the serial accuser, was now the accused. It was years earlier, in late 2012, that Beech had first contacted police claiming his stepfather, Raymond, and Savile had abused him as a child. He was referred to Wiltshire police by Scotland Yard\u2019s Operation Yewtree into the TV presenter Savile. Though he alleged he had been abused by a group of up to 20 men, Beech named only his stepfather \u2013 who had died in 1995 \u2013 and the late Savile as perpetrators. But detectives could not substantiate the claims and shut the case after six months. At the time, Beech had recently divorced his wife, Dawn, after 20 years of marriage. Their son went to live with his father. Dawn confronted her ex-husband after recognising his silhouette in an interview that featured on a BBC Panorama episode in October 2015, but he denied it was him. The pair had married in 1992, four years after meeting during nursing training at the Royal Berkshire hospital in Reading. Dawn told the trial that during a breakdown her husband had confided in her about his claims that his stepfather had sexually abused him, but had never made any mention of a VIP paedophile ring during their marriage. When he went to the police, Beech was a pillar of respectability. After originally training as a paediatric nurse, he had enjoyed a successful career as an NHS manager at the Great Western hospitals trust. In January 2012, he joined the medical watchdog the Care Quality Commission as an inspector. He was suspended in November 2016 and sacked the following June when charged by police. Beech gave talks to children as young as five about the dangers of abuse on behalf of the NSPCC, the Guardian has learned. He volunteered for the charity\u2019s school speakers programme from November 2012 until July 2015, delivering assemblies and workshops to young children. Beech spoke to key stage 1 and 2 pupils at primary schools in Herefordshire as part of the NSPCC\u2019s Speak Out Stay Safe scheme. It is understood the charity was aware at the time that Beech\u2019s allegations had triggered Operation Midland, although he is not thought to have referred to his own experiences during the school talks. He formally resigned and handed in his ID in February 2017. The charity said it had received no complaints about his behaviour while he had volunteered at 33 schools. Beech was also a governor at two schools. One was Severn Vale, an academy in Quedgeley on the outskirts of Gloucester, where he was a governor from January 2014 until he was removed from the position in March 2017. The headteacher, Richard Johnson, described Beech as a \u201cvery intelligent, articulate individual\u201d. He said the school had no safeguarding complaints about him and he had an enhanced DBS check. Beech served as chair of governors at Beech Green primary school, also in Quedgeley, where he was involved for more than a decade. The headteacher, Julie Poulson, confirmed Beech had been a governor from 2006 until February 2017 and that no safeguarding concerns had been raised about him. Beech\u2019s claims have proved controversial with his family. His mother married Robert Gass in 1966. Beech was born in 1968 but his parents divorced in 1971, and he had little contact with his father, who had two children from a previous marriage and one more in a subsequent marriage. Beech\u2019s half-sister Lin Brown, 58, who lives in Wallasey, Wirral, said she had not seen her half-brother for more than 25 years. \u201cFrom the things he\u2019s done, I\u2019ve disowned him. He\u2019s not my brother,\u201d she said. Charmian went on to marry Raymond Beech, at the time a 40-year-old major in the Royal Artillery, in 1976 in Salisbury. Beech already had three children from his marriage to his first wife. It is during this period, when Beech was living with his mother, stepfather and step-siblings, that he claimed he was sexually abused by Raymond and introduced to the VIP paedophile ring. Beech\u2019s mother\u2019s relationship with Raymond was short-lived: she moved out of the officer\u2019s home with her son later the same year they had married. She is understood to believe her son\u2019s claims about being abused by his stepfather. Beech\u2019s trial heard how his stepfather\u2019s military records detailed that the major had a history of alcoholism and domestic violence, including against Charmian. However, there was no complaint of sexual assault or abuse in the records. He was discharged from the army in 1977 after being diagnosed with a personality disorder that led to him being \u201cdangerously explosive\u201d in his actions. Raymond\u2019s first wife, Joan Harborne, 80, and her three eldest children are understood to vehemently deny Beech\u2019s allegations, making their feelings clear to Operation Midland investigators and then to Northumbria police. In Sweden, locals in \u00d6verkalix are still scratching their heads at how the star witness of Operation Midland \u2013 which destroyed lives, reputations, and confidence among child abuse survivors \u2013 could have landed on their doorstep. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s a big mystery still,\u201d said Elemalm the plumber, who has lived in the area his whole life. \u201cIt will always be.\u201d",

Official growth figures for the second quarter are due to be published next month.</p> <p>Economists consider two consecutive quarters of economic contraction a recession. NIESR forecasts GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter, with a 25% chance that GDP declines again in the third quarter between July and September. However, the thinktank\u2019s central forecast is for growth of 0.2% in the third quarter.</p> <p>\u201cThe short-term outlook for the UK economy is very murky indeed, with a significant risk that a severe economic downturn will begin within the next six months,\u201d NIESR said.</p> <p>Warning the risk of leaving without a deal was rising with less than six months left before the next prime minister runs out of time to renegotiate a deal with Brussels, NIESR said the country risked an even more severe downturn in the autumn. It said economic growth over the long run could be damaged by about 5% a year.</p> <p>Jagjit Chadha, director of the thinktank, which is Britain\u2019s longest-established independent research institute, said a no-deal Brexit would in effect \u201cthrow concrete\u201d in the wheels of British trade with the EU at a moment when the UK is already \u201cfragile and vulnerable\u201d from a slowdown in growth.</p> <p>\u201cHowever we look at it, there will not be much economic joy in such an exit,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Alongside domestic uncertainty, growth in the world economy has deteriorated over recent months against a backdrop of rising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/15/chinese-economic-growth-falls-to-62-as-global-slowdown-bites\">trade tensions between the US and China</a>, harming business confidence and serving as a brake on growth.</p> <p>NIESR cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2019 and 2020 to 1.2% and 1.1%, down from 1.4% and 1.6% previously, as a result of the loss of momentum. However, it still said its forecasts were based on the next prime minister securing a deal with Brussels this autumn.</p> <p>Acknowledging that the UK crashing out without a deal on 31 October was becoming increasingly likely, the thinktank warned that the pound could plunge by about 10% against the US dollar to about $1.10. Inflation would then likely surge to about 4% as the price of importing goods to Britain rises, the highest level in almost eight years and more than double the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%.</p> <p>It said Threadneedle Street could cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 0.25% and the Treasury could ramp up spending to offset the hit to the economy, enabling growth to remain at zero next year under such a scenario.</p> <p>However, given the wide degree of uncertainty over the exact impact a no-deal Brexit would have on the UK, it said the outcome could be much worse \u2013 with a 30% chance of recession next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Business email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere is no palpable growth for some years to come following a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Chadha said.</p> <p>The thinktank\u2019s forecast for a no-deal scenario where the UK escapes recession next year could embolden Brexiters. However, it said public borrowing would rise sharply, breaking the Conservatives\u2019 deficit reduction promises.</p> <p>Public borrowing as a percentage of GDP could balloon from the current level of 1.2% of GDP to about 3.8% by 2022 under such a scenario.

      "bodyText": "The mounting risk of no-deal Brexit may have pushed the UK economy into a recession already, one of the country\u2019s foremost economic forecasters has warned. Sounding the alarm before the expected elevation of Boris Johnson to Downing Street this week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) said there was a one in four chance the country is in a recession currently. Against a backdrop of renewed uncertainty and the increasing likelihood of no-deal Brexit under a Johnson premiership, growth has stalled in recent months, business investment has faltered and the pound has fallen sharply. Some economists believe the UK economy contracted in the three months to June, marking the first negative quarter in seven years, as a consequence of factory closures planned to avert any potential disruption around the original 29 March Brexit deadline. Official growth figures for the second quarter are due to be published next month. Economists consider two consecutive quarters of economic contraction a recession. NIESR forecasts GDP fell by 0.1% in the second quarter, with a 25% chance that GDP declines again in the third quarter between July and September. However, the thinktank\u2019s central forecast is for growth of 0.2% in the third quarter. \u201cThe short-term outlook for the UK economy is very murky indeed, with a significant risk that a severe economic downturn will begin within the next six months,\u201d NIESR said. Warning the risk of leaving without a deal was rising with less than six months left before the next prime minister runs out of time to renegotiate a deal with Brussels, NIESR said the country risked an even more severe downturn in the autumn. It said economic growth over the long run could be damaged by about 5% a year. Jagjit Chadha, director of the thinktank, which is Britain\u2019s longest-established independent research institute, said a no-deal Brexit would in effect \u201cthrow concrete\u201d in the wheels of British trade with the EU at a moment when the UK is already \u201cfragile and vulnerable\u201d from a slowdown in growth. \u201cHowever we look at it, there will not be much economic joy in such an exit,\u201d he added. Alongside domestic uncertainty, growth in the world economy has deteriorated over recent months against a backdrop of rising trade tensions between the US and China, harming business confidence and serving as a brake on growth. NIESR cut its forecasts for economic growth in 2019 and 2020 to 1.2% and 1.1%, down from 1.4% and 1.6% previously, as a result of the loss of momentum. However, it still said its forecasts were based on the next prime minister securing a deal with Brussels this autumn. Acknowledging that the UK crashing out without a deal on 31 October was becoming increasingly likely, the thinktank warned that the pound could plunge by about 10% against the US dollar to about $1.10. Inflation would then likely surge to about 4% as the price of importing goods to Britain rises, the highest level in almost eight years and more than double the Bank of England\u2019s target of 2%. It said Threadneedle Street could cut interest rates by 0.5 percentage points to 0.25% and the Treasury could ramp up spending to offset the hit to the economy, enabling growth to remain at zero next year under such a scenario. However, given the wide degree of uncertainty over the exact impact a no-deal Brexit would have on the UK, it said the outcome could be much worse \u2013 with a 30% chance of recession next year. \u201cThere is no palpable growth for some years to come following a no-deal Brexit,\u201d Chadha said. The thinktank\u2019s forecast for a no-deal scenario where the UK escapes recession next year could embolden Brexiters. However, it said public borrowing would rise sharply, breaking the Conservatives\u2019 deficit reduction promises. Public borrowing as a percentage of GDP could balloon from the current level of 1.2% of GDP to about 3.8% by 2022 under such a scenario. The Tories have pledged to keep borrowing below 2% by that time.",

At first glance of the graph, it looks as if the number of couples meeting at a bar or restaurant has gone up, but that\u2019s only because they \u201cmet\u201d online first and the bar was the site of their first face-to-face meeting.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise of online dating has displaced every other way of meeting to a certain extent,\u201d says Michael Rosenfeld, a professor of sociology and lead researcher of the study. \u201cWhen we last looked at this with data from 2009, friends were still by far the most popular way heterosexual couples met partners. I have been a little bit surprised at how much the internet has displaced friends.\u201d He thought the internet could \u201cleverage friends \u2013 that is, you could meet people through Facebook\u201d, but apart from a few dating sites that make that the selling point, people are using online dating entirely separately from their social networks.</p> <p>Will everyone meet this way in the future? Rosenfeld says he doesn\u2019t want to make predictions, but that it is possible online dating has reached a plateau. The accessibility of web browsers in the mid-90s, and the invention of internet-enabled smartphones just over a decade ago, have had a huge impact. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to see another innovation as powerful as those two in the next 20 years.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Online dating has lost its stigma</strong></h2> <p>\u201cPeople I interviewed talked about starting online dating years ago and being really coy about it and not wanting anyone to know,\u201d says Roisin Ryan-Flood, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Essex, who is writing a book about online dating. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re much more open about it because it\u2019s become so ubiquitous. One of my participants said: \u2018Tinder made online dating cool.\u2019 I think there\u2019s a perception it went mainstream.\u201d</p> <p>As we live in an increasingly digital world, it\u2019s not surprising, she says, that our relationships have been made digital the same way as online shopping or booking a holiday. \u201cAlthough online dating does involve rejection, it does also present a lot of possibilities to meet new people,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom my research, people would often talk about online dating as: \u2018I\u2019m really busy and this is an efficient way of meeting people.\u2019 You could go on a dating app and line up a different date every night of the week.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/30/playing-the-field-can-dating-apps-find-you-love-at-glastonbury\">Playing the field: can dating apps find you love at Glastonbury?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The view that it is fuelling short-term, meaningless connections isn\u2019t quite right, says Julia Carter, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of the West of England. \u201cWhen you look at the data and talk to couples, those who met online tend to not say dissimilar things to people who met in more traditional ways. While the very start of relationships might be different \u2013 meeting online might give those first few dates a different flavour \u2013 when those relationships start to become established, then the way we do things hasn\u2019t really changed.\u201d</p> <p>What matters more, says Jacqui Gabb, a professor of sociology and intimacy at the Open University, is intention. \u201cIt\u2019s a commitment to making a relationship work. You could argue that if you\u2019re actively going out and looking for a relationship, you\u2019re more likely to make it work. If those who commit to relationships through internet dating are looking actively for a long-term partnership, then they\u2019re more likely to stay together.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Childhood sweethearts </strong><strong>are in decline</strong></h2> <p>In the UK and US, people are marrying later. In Britain, the age at first marriage has been rising since the early 70s and is now 37.9 for men and 35.5 for women. \u201cPeople are doing a lot more dating and experimenting before settling down,\u201d says Rosenfeld. The Stanford study shows the decline of the childhood sweetheart, although for the UK it was maybe never such a big thing to begin with. \u201cI wonder how different it would be to do this study here,\u201d says Carter, adding that it seems like a very American cultural phenomenon. \u201cAs we\u2019ve become more globalised, those local narrow contexts \u2013 and the very small community of primary school and secondary school friends \u2013 don\u2019t have so much of an influence on how we can imagine our futures.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>So are enduring university romances</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIn the past, you could meet someone at university and you accepted that and were happy,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWhat has happened is this dating technology has removed that stopping point, so people carry on looking. In the past [people] might have settled down with their university girlfriend or boyfriend, whereas now they have this imagined wider field of potential partners, so that\u2019s having an impact on when people settle down. We know people are getting married lots later in life, and having children later in life so that university relationship tends to fizzle out.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/17/sexy-dating-app-algorithms-score\">Should dating apps tell us how sexy we are? | Coco Khan</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Workplace romances are falling out of favour</strong></h2> <p>\u201cI was quite surprised about that,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt went up hugely in the 70s and peaked around the 80s \u2013 I think that\u2019s because women were entering the workforce in large numbers \u2013 and now it\u2019s coming down. I\u2019m not sure we can say that\u2019s wholly explainable by attitudes now to workplace romances or merely a levelling out in the data over time.\u201d Rosenfeld says it has become easier to meet people online than in offices. \u201cIn college, there are lots of single people around you, but if you\u2019re in the workforce, all of a sudden it\u2019s not 100% clear who\u2019s single or if it\u2019s appropriate to date your supervisor. Real-life problems intrude.\u201d</p> <p>Have office romances become more unacceptable? \u201cThere are certainly downsides to dating somebody at work,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce things go sour and you have to see them every day, that\u2019s a downside. Our friends in human resources have put their nose into it a little bit and suggested the office is not a great place for romance.\u201d</p> <p>It could be that, in the wake of #MeToo revelations of sexual harassment, people are keener to have \u201cprofessional distance at work,\u201d says Ryan-Flood. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing if it makes people more aware about sexual harassment or boundaries,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t get together with someone who sexually harasses you.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>You don\u2019t love thy neighbour</strong></h2> <p>Fewer people are getting together with their neighbours \u2013 again related to a more mobile population, settling down at a later age. \u201cSeventy years ago, Americans were marrying when they were 19 or 20 years old,\u201d says Rosenfeld. \u201cYou haven\u2019t really gone anywhere, so you\u2019re talking about [marrying someone] from high school, church or the neighbourhood \u2013 those were the only people you ever met. Now people are settling down later in life, so they\u2019re travelled, they\u2019ve lived in different places and the neighbourhood of origin is not as relevant as it used to be.\u201d</p> <p>It may also have something to do with the fact we don\u2019t know our neighbours any more. A study in the UK last year found <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britons-neighbours-strangers-uk-community-a8373761.html\" title=\"\">73% of people didn\u2019t know their neighbours\u2019 names</a> and 68% described them as \u201cstrangers\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/17/refrigerdating-would-you-date-someone-whats-in-fridge\">Refrigerdating: would you date someone because of what's in their fridge? | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Our </strong><strong>love stories are getting more boring \u2013 or at least shorter</strong></h2> <p>In 2009, respondents to the survey used 67 words to tell the story of how they met. By 2017, that had shrunk to 37 words, probably because it doesn\u2019t take many to say: \u201cI went on Tinder and swiped right.\u201d Is it a shame we\u2019re losing those stories of sparks and spontaneity? \u201cSome people I interviewed did express a kind of nostalgia for this idea of a different way people dated as opposed to going online, and there was a sense of disposability, but most of the time people had really positive experiences,\u201d says Ryan-Flood.</p> <p>Anyway, technology will change \u201cand maybe Tinder will seem really quaint and romantic\u201d, she says, with a laugh. \u201cMy parents met at a dance, and that doesn\u2019t strike me as epically romantic. I don\u2019t think apps are any better or worse than any other way. What really counts is meeting someone with whom you feel a connection.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "For future generations, the question: \u201cHow did you and Grandad meet?\u201d, will be answered with: \u201cTinder, obviously.\u201d Within eight years, the internet has become the dominant way heterosexual couples meet. The latest How Couples Meet and Stay Together study by Stanford University found that 39% of heterosexual couples met through online dating or apps, up from 22% in 2009, when the study was last conducted. Life has been disrupted by technology, and so has dating. What else can we learn about how romance has changed? We meet strangers, not friends of friends People meeting through friends \u2013 previously the largest category \u2013 has fallen from 34% in 1990 to 20% in the most recent data; other routes to relationships, such as meeting through work, family and neighbours, have also declined. At first glance of the graph, it looks as if the number of couples meeting at a bar or restaurant has gone up, but that\u2019s only because they \u201cmet\u201d online first and the bar was the site of their first face-to-face meeting. \u201cThe rise of online dating has displaced every other way of meeting to a certain extent,\u201d says Michael Rosenfeld, a professor of sociology and lead researcher of the study. \u201cWhen we last looked at this with data from 2009, friends were still by far the most popular way heterosexual couples met partners. I have been a little bit surprised at how much the internet has displaced friends.\u201d He thought the internet could \u201cleverage friends \u2013 that is, you could meet people through Facebook\u201d, but apart from a few dating sites that make that the selling point, people are using online dating entirely separately from their social networks. Will everyone meet this way in the future? Rosenfeld says he doesn\u2019t want to make predictions, but that it is possible online dating has reached a plateau. The accessibility of web browsers in the mid-90s, and the invention of internet-enabled smartphones just over a decade ago, have had a huge impact. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019re going to see another innovation as powerful as those two in the next 20 years.\u201d Online dating has lost its stigma \u201cPeople I interviewed talked about starting online dating years ago and being really coy about it and not wanting anyone to know,\u201d says Roisin Ryan-Flood, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of Essex, who is writing a book about online dating. \u201cAnd now they\u2019re much more open about it because it\u2019s become so ubiquitous. One of my participants said: \u2018Tinder made online dating cool.\u2019 I think there\u2019s a perception it went mainstream.\u201d As we live in an increasingly digital world, it\u2019s not surprising, she says, that our relationships have been made digital the same way as online shopping or booking a holiday. \u201cAlthough online dating does involve rejection, it does also present a lot of possibilities to meet new people,\u201d she says. \u201cFrom my research, people would often talk about online dating as: \u2018I\u2019m really busy and this is an efficient way of meeting people.\u2019 You could go on a dating app and line up a different date every night of the week.\u201d The view that it is fuelling short-term, meaningless connections isn\u2019t quite right, says Julia Carter, a senior lecturer in sociology at the University of the West of England. \u201cWhen you look at the data and talk to couples, those who met online tend to not say dissimilar things to people who met in more traditional ways. While the very start of relationships might be different \u2013 meeting online might give those first few dates a different flavour \u2013 when those relationships start to become established, then the way we do things hasn\u2019t really changed.\u201d What matters more, says Jacqui Gabb, a professor of sociology and intimacy at the Open University, is intention. \u201cIt\u2019s a commitment to making a relationship work. You could argue that if you\u2019re actively going out and looking for a relationship, you\u2019re more likely to make it work. If those who commit to relationships through internet dating are looking actively for a long-term partnership, then they\u2019re more likely to stay together.\u201d Childhood sweethearts are in decline In the UK and US, people are marrying later. In Britain, the age at first marriage has been rising since the early 70s and is now 37.9 for men and 35.5 for women. \u201cPeople are doing a lot more dating and experimenting before settling down,\u201d says Rosenfeld. The Stanford study shows the decline of the childhood sweetheart, although for the UK it was maybe never such a big thing to begin with. \u201cI wonder how different it would be to do this study here,\u201d says Carter, adding that it seems like a very American cultural phenomenon. \u201cAs we\u2019ve become more globalised, those local narrow contexts \u2013 and the very small community of primary school and secondary school friends \u2013 don\u2019t have so much of an influence on how we can imagine our futures.\u201d So are enduring university romances \u201cIn the past, you could meet someone at university and you accepted that and were happy,\u201d says Carter. \u201cWhat has happened is this dating technology has removed that stopping point, so people carry on looking. In the past [people] might have settled down with their university girlfriend or boyfriend, whereas now they have this imagined wider field of potential partners, so that\u2019s having an impact on when people settle down. We know people are getting married lots later in life, and having children later in life so that university relationship tends to fizzle out.\u201d Workplace romances are falling out of favour \u201cI was quite surprised about that,\u201d says Carter. \u201cIt went up hugely in the 70s and peaked around the 80s \u2013 I think that\u2019s because women were entering the workforce in large numbers \u2013 and now it\u2019s coming down. I\u2019m not sure we can say that\u2019s wholly explainable by attitudes now to workplace romances or merely a levelling out in the data over time.\u201d Rosenfeld says it has become easier to meet people online than in offices. \u201cIn college, there are lots of single people around you, but if you\u2019re in the workforce, all of a sudden it\u2019s not 100% clear who\u2019s single or if it\u2019s appropriate to date your supervisor. Real-life problems intrude.\u201d Have office romances become more unacceptable? \u201cThere are certainly downsides to dating somebody at work,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce things go sour and you have to see them every day, that\u2019s a downside. Our friends in human resources have put their nose into it a little bit and suggested the office is not a great place for romance.\u201d It could be that, in the wake of #MeToo revelations of sexual harassment, people are keener to have \u201cprofessional distance at work,\u201d says Ryan-Flood. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing if it makes people more aware about sexual harassment or boundaries,\u201d she says, adding: \u201cYou don\u2019t get together with someone who sexually harasses you.\u201d You don\u2019t love thy neighbour Fewer people are getting together with their neighbours \u2013 again related to a more mobile population, settling down at a later age. \u201cSeventy years ago, Americans were marrying when they were 19 or 20 years old,\u201d says Rosenfeld. \u201cYou haven\u2019t really gone anywhere, so you\u2019re talking about [marrying someone] from high school, church or the neighbourhood \u2013 those were the only people you ever met. Now people are settling down later in life, so they\u2019re travelled, they\u2019ve lived in different places and the neighbourhood of origin is not as relevant as it used to be.\u201d It may also have something to do with the fact we don\u2019t know our neighbours any more. A study in the UK last year found 73% of people didn\u2019t know their neighbours\u2019 names and 68% described them as \u201cstrangers\u201d. Our love stories are getting more boring \u2013 or at least shorter In 2009, respondents to the survey used 67 words to tell the story of how they met. By 2017, that had shrunk to 37 words, probably because it doesn\u2019t take many to say: \u201cI went on Tinder and swiped right.\u201d Is it a shame we\u2019re losing those stories of sparks and spontaneity? \u201cSome people I interviewed did express a kind of nostalgia for this idea of a different way people dated as opposed to going online, and there was a sense of disposability, but most of the time people had really positive experiences,\u201d says Ryan-Flood. Anyway, technology will change \u201cand maybe Tinder will seem really quaint and romantic\u201d, she says, with a laugh. \u201cMy parents met at a dance, and that doesn\u2019t strike me as epically romantic. I don\u2019t think apps are any better or worse than any other way. What really counts is meeting someone with whom you feel a connection.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>On the stage of a small theatre outside Avignon, a man paces around a mock-up of an apartment. Music issues from somewhere and there is a sense of a cityscape, close but impossible to reach. The man mutters to his shadow, sees visions, engages in conversation with people who might or might not be there. The door bursts open, revealing goons wearing the uniform of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB). An interrogation commences. Afterwards, the man stands looking out, illuminated by an outsized red star that looks as if it\u2019s been filched from the roof of the Kremlin. Later, he attempts to crank open the window and jump.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://www.festival-avignon.com/en/shows/2019/outside\">Outside</a>, a new play that has just opened at the Avignon festival. As the images pile up, they make you think of one thing above all else: the director and writer of the work, Russian theatre-maker Kirill Serebrennikov.

Disturbing, but not in the ways one might expect. While the director\u2019s own plight \u2013 a constant drumbeat in the show \u2013 is impossible to ignore, it is also not really the point. \u201cIt\u2019s about much more than the politics,\u201d says Sofia Kapkova, <a href=\"https://mart.foundation/\">whose international arts foundation Mart </a><a href=\"https://mart.foundation/\">co-produced the work</a>.</p> <p>Serebrennikov himself, speaking via secure audio message from Moscow while he awaits the outcome of his trial, would prefer not to address politics at all. Though the piece is \u201cbased on my own fantasies\u201d, he denies that the man on stage, named the Escapee, is him. Well, not quite him. \u201cIt\u2019s an accumulative image of a person,\u201d he tells me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8524b1a615ed8baab58089f99501ef57fc9d97ec\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8524b1a615ed8baab58089f99501ef57fc9d97ec/0_165_3040_4742/641.jpg\" alt=\"A supporter of Serebrennikov wears a paper bag with the writer-director\u2019s image at the 2018 Berlin international film festival, in Germany.\" width=\"641\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A supporter of Serebrennikov wears a paper bag with the writer-director\u2019s image at the 2018 Berlin international film festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DPA Picture Alliance/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Seven years ago, Serebrennikov had everything. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-rise-and-fall-of-russias-most-acclaimed-theatre-director\">Lauded by artists and critics</a> on Moscow\u2019s punky avant-garde arts scene, yet also adept at schmoozing the city\u2019s power brokers, he seemed high above the political fray. In 2012, he was invited to run the Gogol Centre in the city\u2019s unfashionable Basmanny district, and turned this struggling space into a thrilling arena for experimental drama. A new festival, Platforma, drew passionate young crowds and swooning reviews \u2013 not least because Serebrennikov\u2019s own shows enjoyed poking fun at Putin and the ruling elite.</p> <p>But then, Russian politics became more fraught and authoritarian in the wake of the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and things came crashing down. Platforma\u2019s funding evaporated and three Gogol staff were arrested. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/15/trial-of-russian-stage-director-kirill-serebrennikov-seen-as-test-for-artistic-freedom\">Serebrennikov himself was put on trial</a>, charged with embezzling state funds to the tune of 133m rubles (around \u00a31.7m). He faces up to 10 years in jail.</p> <p>Conspiracy theories have multiplied: that the director had offended someone, or drifted too close to power, or was making work that didn\u2019t fit with the wave of intolerant religiosity that has infected Russian culture. One especially Kafkaesque accusation concerned a 2012 production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Even though it had been seen by thousands of people and been shown at an awards ceremony, <a href=\"https://meduza.io/en/feature/2017/08/22/free-kirill-serebrennikov\">prosecutors claimed that it had never happened</a>.</p> <p>It seems unlikely that the truth will ever be clear \u2013 assuming such a commodity exists. One arts producer I speak to has a theory that Russia\u2019s labyrinthine finance regulations are deliberately impossible to follow; no one can be entirely above board. \u201cIt becomes a way of controlling you, if they want,\u201d she says. What\u2019s notable is that Outside is being produced by a private foundation, rather than the Gogol, where Serebrennikov remains artistic director. This project would be too hot to handle for a state-funded organisation.</p> <p>Amid it all, Serebrennikov seemed almost to relish the confrontation. In 2016, he directed a movie called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/05/the-student-film-review\">The Student</a>, which portrayed a teenage boy succumbing to Orthodox Christian fanaticism \u2013 an agonisingly powerful film, but also one in the eye for those intolerant clerics. Even under house arrest, he has completed a new film, Leto, and directed operas remotely in Zurich and Hamburg, watching video footage of rehearsals and sending notes back via USB sticks entrusted to his lawyer. \u201cI simply worked,\u201d he has said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16c74cb1c9efb1260a480bed5dc111352d6a5be4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16c74cb1c9efb1260a480bed5dc111352d6a5be4/0_64_1110_666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serebrennikov\u2019s 2016 film The Student.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serebrennikov\u2019s 2016 film The Student.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside began several years ago, when the director came across photographs of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/arts/design/ren-hang-paris.html\">contemporary Chinese artist Ren Hang</a> \u2013 another figure who had a troubled relationship with a heavy-handed state. Self-taught, known for slyly funny, outlandish and often semi-pornographic images of his friends (<a href=\"https://www.mep-fr.org/event/ren-hang/\">a topless woman clutching a swan, a man </a><a href=\"https://www.mep-fr.org/event/ren-hang/\">peeing on a cactus bush</a>), Ren became an art world star in the west in the early 2010s. He was also gay, and was arrested many times by the Chinese authorities on suspicion of obscenity. \u201cI was hooked by his talent,\u201d Serebrennikov says. \u201cYou see it in every frame.\u201d</p> <p>The director got in touch and the two arranged to meet. Then news came in February 2017 that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-39100128\">Ren had died after jumping from the window of his Beijing tower block</a>. He was 29 and had written openly about his struggles with depression. Six months later, Serebrennikov was confined to his own apartment building. By the time he was released from house arrest last May, still on bail, he had a script based on Ren, co-written with two colleagues, and immediately set to work with actors. It is the first piece he has been able to rehearse in person in almost 18 months.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a lot of pent-up energy,\u201d says the American-Russian actor Odin Biron, who plays the Escapee. \u201cKirill was pretty much bouncing off the walls.\u201d</p> <p>The show is a complex and bewitching amalgam. Both an act of mourning and a celebration of Ren\u2019s extraordinary visual imagination, Outside also weaves in the director\u2019s own fantasies and fears \u2013 one of which is that he, too, might take his own life. After the arrest scene, we watch a sequence of dreamlike encounters with Ren and his images, as if the book of photographs in his apartment had burst to life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad5e43e057911da5d07ffe6cb35a4cb88ab63238\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad5e43e057911da5d07ffe6cb35a4cb88ab63238/970_654_2573_1544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Outside, by Kirill Serebrennikov.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It\u2019s about much more than politics\u2019 \u2026 a scene from Outside.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christophe Raynaud de Lage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ren, clutching his camera, materialises from the same door that brought in the FSB.

Someone who might be based on Robert Mapplethorpe joins in <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/robert-mapplethorpe-11413/photographs-robert-mapplethorpe\">and it all gets a bit S&amp;M</a>.

It\u2019s as if Serebrennikov has turned the hall of mirrors on itself. \u201cI think it\u2019s about beauty,\u201d says Odin, \u201cand about beauty being the only thing that\u2019s important. It is about the creative struggle every artist goes through: do you want a comfortable life, or a life of ideals?\u201d</p> <p>The play\u2019s title offers a link between Ren and Serebrennikov. Both men were cast as outsiders, but outside is the one place the director \u2013 aside from daily walks \u2013 was not allowed to be. \u201cIt was a time when I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone,\u201d Serebrennikov tells me. \u201cThen I set the piece free, so to speak.\u201d</p> <p>What will happen next? Last month, <a href=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/russian-court-delays-serebrennikov-trial-again-to-allow-completion-of-study/30003878.html\">the director\u2019s trial was delayed yet again</a>, to allow for more evidence to be reviewed \u2013 possibly good news, though no one is sure. Kapkova is hopeful that Serebrennikov might have his passport restored and join a Gogol Centre tour to Tel Aviv this September. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist,\u201d she says, then laughs bitterly. \u201cAnything can happen. Russia is a country of possibility.\u201d (Kapkova hopes it will travel to Europe and perhaps New York.)</p> <p>Serebrennikov would like the piece to speak for itself. Yes, there are no easy answers, either in politics or in art. But in a world that seems more disastrously absolutist and cartoonish by the day, he thinks we should cling to complexity. \u201cOne of the most sinister tendencies of the contemporary world is the tendency for simplification,\u201d he says. \u201cComplexity is today\u2019s act of resistance.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.festival-avignon.com/en/shows/2019/outside\">Outside is at the Avignon festival until 23 July</a>.</p>",

      "bodyText": "On the stage of a small theatre outside Avignon, a man paces around a mock-up of an apartment. Music issues from somewhere and there is a sense of a cityscape, close but impossible to reach. The man mutters to his shadow, sees visions, engages in conversation with people who might or might not be there. The door bursts open, revealing goons wearing the uniform of Russia\u2019s Federal Security Service (FSB). An interrogation commences. Afterwards, the man stands looking out, illuminated by an outsized red star that looks as if it\u2019s been filched from the roof of the Kremlin. Later, he attempts to crank open the window and jump. This is Outside, a new play that has just opened at the Avignon festival. As the images pile up, they make you think of one thing above all else: the director and writer of the work, Russian theatre-maker Kirill Serebrennikov. He\u2019s not so much the ghost at the feast here as a kind of gaping void, probably the most talked about person in town yet invisible but for a few photographs. Arrested in August 2017 on fraud charges, and until recently held under house arrest in conditions resembling those of the man on stage, the director is still not permitted to leave Moscow. At the curtain call of Outside, the cast disappeared mid-applause and returned wearing white T-shirts saying: \u201cFREE KIRILL.\u201d The following morning, a press conference was held in Serebrennikov\u2019s honour, and he was bestowed an honorary degree in his absence. As a journalist from Le Point magazine put it: \u201cIl d\u00e9range\u201d\u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s disturbing.\u201d Outside is perhaps the most nakedly confessional piece Serebrennikov has ever done. Disturbing, but not in the ways one might expect. While the director\u2019s own plight \u2013 a constant drumbeat in the show \u2013 is impossible to ignore, it is also not really the point. \u201cIt\u2019s about much more than the politics,\u201d says Sofia Kapkova, whose international arts foundation Mart co-produced the work. Serebrennikov himself, speaking via secure audio message from Moscow while he awaits the outcome of his trial, would prefer not to address politics at all. Though the piece is \u201cbased on my own fantasies\u201d, he denies that the man on stage, named the Escapee, is him. Well, not quite him. \u201cIt\u2019s an accumulative image of a person,\u201d he tells me. Seven years ago, Serebrennikov had everything. Lauded by artists and critics on Moscow\u2019s punky avant-garde arts scene, yet also adept at schmoozing the city\u2019s power brokers, he seemed high above the political fray. In 2012, he was invited to run the Gogol Centre in the city\u2019s unfashionable Basmanny district, and turned this struggling space into a thrilling arena for experimental drama. A new festival, Platforma, drew passionate young crowds and swooning reviews \u2013 not least because Serebrennikov\u2019s own shows enjoyed poking fun at Putin and the ruling elite. But then, Russian politics became more fraught and authoritarian in the wake of the illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, and things came crashing down. Platforma\u2019s funding evaporated and three Gogol staff were arrested. Serebrennikov himself was put on trial, charged with embezzling state funds to the tune of 133m rubles (around \u00a31.7m). He faces up to 10 years in jail. Conspiracy theories have multiplied: that the director had offended someone, or drifted too close to power, or was making work that didn\u2019t fit with the wave of intolerant religiosity that has infected Russian culture. One especially Kafkaesque accusation concerned a 2012 production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream. Even though it had been seen by thousands of people and been shown at an awards ceremony, prosecutors claimed that it had never happened. It seems unlikely that the truth will ever be clear \u2013 assuming such a commodity exists. One arts producer I speak to has a theory that Russia\u2019s labyrinthine finance regulations are deliberately impossible to follow; no one can be entirely above board. \u201cIt becomes a way of controlling you, if they want,\u201d she says. What\u2019s notable is that Outside is being produced by a private foundation, rather than the Gogol, where Serebrennikov remains artistic director. This project would be too hot to handle for a state-funded organisation. Amid it all, Serebrennikov seemed almost to relish the confrontation. In 2016, he directed a movie called The Student, which portrayed a teenage boy succumbing to Orthodox Christian fanaticism \u2013 an agonisingly powerful film, but also one in the eye for those intolerant clerics. Even under house arrest, he has completed a new film, Leto, and directed operas remotely in Zurich and Hamburg, watching video footage of rehearsals and sending notes back via USB sticks entrusted to his lawyer. \u201cI simply worked,\u201d he has said. Outside began several years ago, when the director came across photographs of contemporary Chinese artist Ren Hang \u2013 another figure who had a troubled relationship with a heavy-handed state. Self-taught, known for slyly funny, outlandish and often semi-pornographic images of his friends (a topless woman clutching a swan, a man peeing on a cactus bush), Ren became an art world star in the west in the early 2010s. He was also gay, and was arrested many times by the Chinese authorities on suspicion of obscenity. \u201cI was hooked by his talent,\u201d Serebrennikov says. \u201cYou see it in every frame.\u201d The director got in touch and the two arranged to meet. Then news came in February 2017 that Ren had died after jumping from the window of his Beijing tower block. He was 29 and had written openly about his struggles with depression. Six months later, Serebrennikov was confined to his own apartment building. By the time he was released from house arrest last May, still on bail, he had a script based on Ren, co-written with two colleagues, and immediately set to work with actors. It is the first piece he has been able to rehearse in person in almost 18 months. \u201cThere was a lot of pent-up energy,\u201d says the American-Russian actor Odin Biron, who plays the Escapee. \u201cKirill was pretty much bouncing off the walls.\u201d The show is a complex and bewitching amalgam. Both an act of mourning and a celebration of Ren\u2019s extraordinary visual imagination, Outside also weaves in the director\u2019s own fantasies and fears \u2013 one of which is that he, too, might take his own life. After the arrest scene, we watch a sequence of dreamlike encounters with Ren and his images, as if the book of photographs in his apartment had burst to life. Ren, clutching his camera, materialises from the same door that brought in the FSB. A cavalcade of male and female models follow and cheerfully remove their clothes. They pose with an array of surreal props \u2013 hints of Ren\u2019s photographs, though the real images never actually appear. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to use them,\u201d says Serebrennikov. \u201cWe wanted to create our own story.\u201d A live band arrives and just as rapidly disrobes. Someone who might be based on Robert Mapplethorpe joins in and it all gets a bit S&amp;M. Sex runs through the piece, with nudity near-constant. But it is oddly innocent, even poignant, giving the sense that, in a repressive, surveillance-obsessed world, desire is one of the few things people have left. Filled with music and illuminated by stage tableaux of piercing beauty, Outside is somewhere between fever dream, nervous breakdown and act of fierce creative resistance. It\u2019s as if Serebrennikov has turned the hall of mirrors on itself. \u201cI think it\u2019s about beauty,\u201d says Odin, \u201cand about beauty being the only thing that\u2019s important. It is about the creative struggle every artist goes through: do you want a comfortable life, or a life of ideals?\u201d The play\u2019s title offers a link between Ren and Serebrennikov. Both men were cast as outsiders, but outside is the one place the director \u2013 aside from daily walks \u2013 was not allowed to be. \u201cIt was a time when I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone,\u201d Serebrennikov tells me. \u201cThen I set the piece free, so to speak.\u201d What will happen next? Last month, the director\u2019s trial was delayed yet again, to allow for more evidence to be reviewed \u2013 possibly good news, though no one is sure. Kapkova is hopeful that Serebrennikov might have his passport restored and join a Gogol Centre tour to Tel Aviv this September. \u201cI\u2019m an optimist,\u201d she says, then laughs bitterly. \u201cAnything can happen. Russia is a country of possibility.\u201d (Kapkova hopes it will travel to Europe and perhaps New York.) Serebrennikov would like the piece to speak for itself. Yes, there are no easy answers, either in politics or in art. But in a world that seems more disastrously absolutist and cartoonish by the day, he thinks we should cling to complexity. \u201cOne of the most sinister tendencies of the contemporary world is the tendency for simplification,\u201d he says. \u201cComplexity is today\u2019s act of resistance.\u201d \u2022 Outside is at the Avignon festival until 23 July.",

I was nagged by the sinkful of washing up that needed doing and the bin that needed to be taken out. I thought about the podcasts I could be listening to. Shamefully, I found myself wondering if anyone had written any good tweets. In the end, I managed 10 minutes of niksen before my brain stopped idling and told me to stop being such a layabout. Still, they were 10 very nice minutes. Niksen isn\u2019t something you can just plunge into, it turns out. It takes time to build up to a level of comfort where you can happily do nothing. And so help me God, I\u2019m going to get there if it kills me.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Katie Alcott, founder and chief executive of Frank Water, a charity based in Bristol, studied fine art at the University of the West of England Bristol (UWE Bristol). She has been awarded an MBE and won many national and local awards for social entrepreneurship, including an award for young entrepreneur of the year, a women of the future award, and Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s Future 100 award.</strong></p> <p>I founded Frank Water a few years after leaving UWE Bristol in 2005. But my initial passion for human rights stemmed from my first trip to India in the year before I started at UWE Bristol. I taught English in Kashmir and noticed children, particularly girls, often skipped classes. I later realised it was down to water-related illnesses. Then I got dysentery myself, from the unclean water, and was so ill that I lost about two stone in four months.</p> <p>After that, I started at UWE Bristol. While I was there I learned about different cultures through my course and in the process of working on my art. I also had the chance to go abroad \u2013 I spent three months in Barcelona on an Erasmus exchange. This helped develop my interest in the world. UWE Bristol was an amazing experience. It was multicultural and I met people from different walks of life. It was a real eye-opener. But it was also supportive and friendly. It was very much like a family environment and felt almost like a home away from home.</p> <p>After I graduated, I spent six months working as a photojournalist.

      "bodyText": "Katie Alcott, founder and chief executive of Frank Water, a charity based in Bristol, studied fine art at the University of the West of England Bristol (UWE Bristol). She has been awarded an MBE and won many national and local awards for social entrepreneurship, including an award for young entrepreneur of the year, a women of the future award, and Ernst &amp; Young\u2019s Future 100 award. I founded Frank Water a few years after leaving UWE Bristol in 2005. But my initial passion for human rights stemmed from my first trip to India in the year before I started at UWE Bristol. I taught English in Kashmir and noticed children, particularly girls, often skipped classes. I later realised it was down to water-related illnesses. Then I got dysentery myself, from the unclean water, and was so ill that I lost about two stone in four months. After that, I started at UWE Bristol. While I was there I learned about different cultures through my course and in the process of working on my art. I also had the chance to go abroad \u2013 I spent three months in Barcelona on an Erasmus exchange. This helped develop my interest in the world. UWE Bristol was an amazing experience. It was multicultural and I met people from different walks of life. It was a real eye-opener. But it was also supportive and friendly. It was very much like a family environment and felt almost like a home away from home. After I graduated, I spent six months working as a photojournalist. Then I returned to Bristol and noticed everyone was drinking bottled water. I thought: \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d It was strange to me, because I was aware of people in other countries not having access to clean drinking water. I thought: \u201cMaybe I can create a business around this,\u201d and that\u2019s how Frank Water was born.

      "bodyText": "The French navy has located one of its submarines that disappeared more than 50 years ago with 52 crew on board. La Minerve was discovered on the seabed in the Mediterranean off the port of Toulon. \u201cIt\u2019s a success, a relief and a technical feat,\u201d Florence Parly, the defence minister, tweeted. \u201cI am thinking of the families who have waited for so long for this moment.\u201d La Minerve was on a military exercise when it disappeared in January 1968. Repeated searches have failed to find the vessel until now. Under pressure from relatives of crew members, a fresh search was launched at the beginning of this year using the latest hi-tech equipment to map and model tides and currents in the Mediterranean. Data from the time of the accident was also re-examined. This included seismic reports that suggested the submarine probably imploded as it dropped to the bottom of the sea. A senior French naval officer told Agence France-Presse the submarine was discovered by a boat belonging to the private US company Ocean Infinity. It announced it had found La Minerve at a depth of 2,370 metres, 27 miles (45km) from Toulon, which is home to a French naval base. The cause of the accident that led to the submarine sinking in just four minutes has never been established. Families hope the wreckage will provide long-awaited answers. The son of La Minerve\u2019s commander, Andr\u00e9 Fauve, said it was a moment of \u201cgreat emotion\u201d for the families of the submariners who perished. \u201cMany people told me they were supporting me during the search because they didn\u2019t want me to feel alone but they didn\u2019t believe it would be found,\u201d Herv\u00e9 Fauve told Le Monde.

While the Electoral Commission, which carried out the research, said the trial in 10 local authority areas in England seemed to have gone smoothly overall, Labour said the scale of the issue meant the government must abandon the scheme. Overall the study found up to 2,083 people were initially turned away for not having the necessary ID with them, and as many as 758 never returned. As a proportion of all votes cast this ranged from 0.7% in two areas, Craven and Pendle, to 0.03% in Mid Sussex. While ministers have said compulsory voter ID is necessary to avoid fraud, critics say there is little evidence of voter impersonation, while ID requirements can particularly put off more vulnerable groups such as older people or those with disabilities. The report said charities that had raised concerns about the scheme represented people with learning disabilities, as well as those without a fixed address, and the BAME, LGBT, and Gypsies and traveller communities. The commission said that in Derby, one of the trial areas, there was a strong correlation between the numbers of people denied a vote in particular wards and the proportion of that ward\u2019s population who were from an Asian background. However, in Pendle this correlation was much weaker, it said. The study said that overall it was impossible to draw definitive conclusions from the pilots \u2013 an initial trial in five areas took place at the 2018 local elections \u2013 about what might happen if they were used nationally or particularly at a general election, where a much greater range of people would be taking part. While the trials showed the schemes seemed to make people believe the voting process was more secure, a series of factors would need to be considered, including what sort of ID was needed. The study also said opinion polls among people who did not vote showed 1% of them said it was because they did not have the right ID. These findings and the concerns about access to ID among some groups \u201craise questions about the effects of an ID requirement at future elections\u201d, the report said. The government has argued there is no reason why people should not show ID to vote, given they are expected to do so in areas of life such as picking up parcels, and that such a system has been used in Northern Ireland for some years. But critics say the scheme is an expensive and damaging waste of time, given the very low rates of voter impersonation. Ahead of the first round of trials it emerged that none of the five boroughs taking part had experienced a single instance of polling station impersonation in the past decade. Cat Smith, Labour\u2019s shadow Cabinet Office minister for voter engagement, said: \u201cIt is now clear that the government\u2019s fixation with voter ID is a blatant attempt by the Tories to rig the result of future elections by voter suppression. \u201cFor years Labour warned that restrictive identification requirements will make it harder for people to vote.

      "body": "<p>Nate Percastre makes $23 an hour working as a line cook at the cafeteria of Facebook\u2019s San Francisco office, a job he loves and looks forward to every day.</p> <p>Almost anywhere else in the country, his wage would have been enough to support his housing, his food, his healthcare and all the other basic costs of living. But in San Francisco, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/01/san-francisco-big-tech-workers-industry\">where the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,700 a month</a>, Percastre, 43, has to work two other jobs in order to survive. Though he lives outside of the city, where rents are lower, and is on the waitlist for more affordable housing, more than 60% of his paycheck goes to his landlord, and his rent has just increased.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so absurd, the crisis that we\u2019re living in right now,\u201d Percastre said. \u201cWhen a company is trying to pay you the same rate that they pay in other cities, we can\u2019t accept that. We\u2019re in San Francisco. The cost of living is way too high. Someone who works 40 hours a week should not be living below the poverty line.\u201d</p> <p>Percastre was part of a protest by Facebook\u2019s cafeteria workers last week, which followed months of negotiations with FlagShip Facility Services, the food services contractor employed by the tech giant, over higher wages and a shorter work day. But the issues they are calling out are echoed throughout San Francisco\u2019s food scene: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/09/san-franciscos-foodie-scene-suffers-as-its-workers-flee-high-cost-of-living\">service workers cannot afford to live in the city where they work.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5045f28091cb3d6094b17c3c7ada3389b658d355\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5045f28091cb3d6094b17c3c7ada3389b658d355/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In San Francisco, where the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,700 a month, some Facebook cafeteria employees have to work two other jobs in order to survive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In San Francisco, where the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,700 a month, some Facebook cafeteria employees have to work two other jobs in order to survive.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of Unite Here Local 2</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cService sector workers, restaurant workers, hospitality workers in the city have all felt the squeeze over the past few years, and that is going to continue,\u201d said Anand Singh, the president of Unite Here Local 2, the union that represents the cafeteria workers. \u201cWhile there is no one-size-fits-all solution with the housing crisis and the affordability crisis, if workers that are working day-in and day-out for the largest tech companies can\u2019t afford to make ends meet, I think we have to seriously examine what it is that we\u2019re doing here.\u201d</p> <p>FlagShip Facility Services offered the San Francisco Facebook cafeteria workers \u201ca compensation and benefits package in line with FlagShip employees in Menlo Park, Seattle, New York City, and Fremont\u201d as well as the offer of further negotiation meetings, said Marion Terrell II, FlagShip Facility Services\u2019 senior vice-president of human resources, in a statement.</p> <p>\u201cFlagShip is committed to ensuring a safe and fair working environment for all our employees, as well as having a positive and proactive relationship with our staff and union partners,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cFlagShip has long-standing relationships with many union partners around the country, and we willingly partner with stakeholders to advance the values of a positive working environment for our staff. We look forward to continuing dialogue with all involved.\u201d</p> <p>Anthony Harrison, a Facebook spokesman, said: \u201cWe value our Culinary team\u2019s work immensely and continue to support the right of FlagShip employees to unionize. We have agreements in place with FlagShip for culinary staff in Menlo Park, Fremont, Seattle as well as New York City and we look forward to FlagShip and Unite Here reaching an agreement.\u201d</p> <p>For the Facebook cafeteria workers, the answer is simple: one job should be enough. Percastre\u2019s situation is not unique. \u201cIt repeats with all my co-workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to work all the jobs.\u201d</p> <p>Delfina Ramirez, 24, works from 6am to 2.30pm as a line cook every day, and then drives for Uber for five to six hours.

      "bodyText": "Nate Percastre makes $23 an hour working as a line cook at the cafeteria of Facebook\u2019s San Francisco office, a job he loves and looks forward to every day. Almost anywhere else in the country, his wage would have been enough to support his housing, his food, his healthcare and all the other basic costs of living. But in San Francisco, where the median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $3,700 a month, Percastre, 43, has to work two other jobs in order to survive. Though he lives outside of the city, where rents are lower, and is on the waitlist for more affordable housing, more than 60% of his paycheck goes to his landlord, and his rent has just increased. \u201cIt\u2019s so absurd, the crisis that we\u2019re living in right now,\u201d Percastre said. \u201cWhen a company is trying to pay you the same rate that they pay in other cities, we can\u2019t accept that. We\u2019re in San Francisco. The cost of living is way too high. Someone who works 40 hours a week should not be living below the poverty line.\u201d Percastre was part of a protest by Facebook\u2019s cafeteria workers last week, which followed months of negotiations with FlagShip Facility Services, the food services contractor employed by the tech giant, over higher wages and a shorter work day. But the issues they are calling out are echoed throughout San Francisco\u2019s food scene: service workers cannot afford to live in the city where they work. \u201cService sector workers, restaurant workers, hospitality workers in the city have all felt the squeeze over the past few years, and that is going to continue,\u201d said Anand Singh, the president of Unite Here Local 2, the union that represents the cafeteria workers. \u201cWhile there is no one-size-fits-all solution with the housing crisis and the affordability crisis, if workers that are working day-in and day-out for the largest tech companies can\u2019t afford to make ends meet, I think we have to seriously examine what it is that we\u2019re doing here.\u201d FlagShip Facility Services offered the San Francisco Facebook cafeteria workers \u201ca compensation and benefits package in line with FlagShip employees in Menlo Park, Seattle, New York City, and Fremont\u201d as well as the offer of further negotiation meetings, said Marion Terrell II, FlagShip Facility Services\u2019 senior vice-president of human resources, in a statement. \u201cFlagShip is committed to ensuring a safe and fair working environment for all our employees, as well as having a positive and proactive relationship with our staff and union partners,\u201d Terrell said. \u201cFlagShip has long-standing relationships with many union partners around the country, and we willingly partner with stakeholders to advance the values of a positive working environment for our staff. We look forward to continuing dialogue with all involved.\u201d Anthony Harrison, a Facebook spokesman, said: \u201cWe value our Culinary team\u2019s work immensely and continue to support the right of FlagShip employees to unionize. We have agreements in place with FlagShip for culinary staff in Menlo Park, Fremont, Seattle as well as New York City and we look forward to FlagShip and Unite Here reaching an agreement.\u201d For the Facebook cafeteria workers, the answer is simple: one job should be enough. Percastre\u2019s situation is not unique. \u201cIt repeats with all my co-workers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to work all the jobs.\u201d Delfina Ramirez, 24, works from 6am to 2.30pm as a line cook every day, and then drives for Uber for five to six hours. On weekends, she caters parties and events. As a single mother with a five-year-old girl, she\u2019s tired, Ramirez said. But she has no other choice. She rents out a room in her two-bedroom apartment in Daly City, bringing her monthly payments down to $2,200, but it\u2019s still a significant portion of her paycheck. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to take care of my daughter,\u201d Ramirez said. \u201cShe asks me, \u2018Mommy, why do you work so much?\u2019 I tell her I have to do it. I have to pay for rent, I have to pay for the car, I have to pay for school, I have to pay for the phone. Then I spend $118 every week just for transportation.\u201d In negotiating for higher wages and a guarantee of an eight-hour workday with a lunch break, \u201cwe\u2019re simply asking that there\u2019s an even playing field for working people in this city and we extend the promise that one job should be enough,\u201d Singh said. \u201cOur perspective, looking at this company and looking at how these workers are serving tech workers at Facebook, one of the largest companies in the world, the fact that we\u2019re having a dispute is rather remarkable,\u201d Singh said. \u201cIf anyone can afford this, it is the tech industry.\u201d",

But let\u2019s not dwell on the past, because the future promises yet more excitement. Like many 11-year-olds, the Not the Booker is changing.</p> <p>We still want to find this year\u2019s best novels and uncover a few gems that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. We still want to have a serious discussion about literature and prize culture. We still want to have fun. And we still want to hear from you about the books that matter. So this year\u2019s Not the Booker prize begins like every other, with nominations for this year\u2019s best fiction on this very blog and a public vote to whittle those nominations down to a shortlist.</p> <p>It\u2019s here that the important change comes in. This year the public vote will choose three novels for our shortlist. One other book will be selected by the 2018 judging panel. And \u2013 here\u2019s the new bit \u2013 inspired by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/oct/15/tips-links-and-suggestions-what-are-you-reading-this-week#comment-121584941\">a suggestion below the line from Ongley</a>, we\u2019re enlisting the help of Chester\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/nov/28/chesters-award-winning-library-cultural-transformation-public-service-awards\">award-winning</a> <a href=\"https://www.storyhouse.com/venue/storyhouse/library\">Storyhouse library</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.thebookseller.com/british-book-awards/winners/2019\">2019 independent bookseller of the year</a>, Edinburgh\u2019s <a href=\"https://goldenharebooks.com/\">Golden Hare Books</a>. They\u2019ll each select one novel to complete our shortlist of six.</p> <p>We\u2019ll read those in turn, as always, at the rate of about one a week. I\u2019ll post my thoughts here on the site and \u2013 crucially \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to post your own opinions about the books below the line. Then there\u2019s the final vote, the judges\u2019 panel and the beautiful moment when we get to bestow an actual Guardian mug on the lucky winner.</p> <p>But that\u2019s then \u2013 and this is now. Which is to say, it\u2019s time to start compiling our very long longlist and discovering a wealth of new talent. As usual, we are asking for nominations for <a href=\"https://thebookerprizes.com/sites/manbosamjo/files/181210%20MB2019%20Rules%20And%20Entry%20Form.pdf\">any book eligible for this year\u2019s Booker prize</a>: it has to be a novel, first written in English and published in the UK or Ireland by a British or Irish publisher between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019. (US authors are still allowed.) All you need to do is to post a comment naming the book and author below the line, alongside the word \u201cnomination\u201d. We\u2019ll be grateful if you can also name the publisher \u2013 and feel free to say why you like the book.</p> <p>At this stage, we only need one nomination for each title. So if someone else has already nominated your favourite novel, there\u2019s no need to nominate it again \u2013 just tell us what it is about the novel that makes it so great.</p> <p>If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/22/mug-up-here-on-the-not-the-booker-prize-2019-terms-and-conditions\">you can find all of our terms and conditions here</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2019/jul/22/mug-up-here-on-the-not-the-booker-prize-2019-terms-and-conditions\"> </a>\u2013 and how radiant and beautiful they are.

      "bodyText": "The Not the Booker prize is back \u2013 for the 11th time. We\u2019ve been uncovering excellent novels for more than a decade, and that\u2019s a mighty fine thing. But let\u2019s not dwell on the past, because the future promises yet more excitement. Like many 11-year-olds, the Not the Booker is changing. We still want to find this year\u2019s best novels and uncover a few gems that might otherwise have gone unnoticed. We still want to have a serious discussion about literature and prize culture. We still want to have fun. And we still want to hear from you about the books that matter. So this year\u2019s Not the Booker prize begins like every other, with nominations for this year\u2019s best fiction on this very blog and a public vote to whittle those nominations down to a shortlist. It\u2019s here that the important change comes in. This year the public vote will choose three novels for our shortlist. One other book will be selected by the 2018 judging panel. And \u2013 here\u2019s the new bit \u2013 inspired by a suggestion below the line from Ongley, we\u2019re enlisting the help of Chester\u2019s award-winning Storyhouse library and the 2019 independent bookseller of the year, Edinburgh\u2019s Golden Hare Books. They\u2019ll each select one novel to complete our shortlist of six. We\u2019ll read those in turn, as always, at the rate of about one a week. I\u2019ll post my thoughts here on the site and \u2013 crucially \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to post your own opinions about the books below the line. Then there\u2019s the final vote, the judges\u2019 panel and the beautiful moment when we get to bestow an actual Guardian mug on the lucky winner. But that\u2019s then \u2013 and this is now. Which is to say, it\u2019s time to start compiling our very long longlist and discovering a wealth of new talent. As usual, we are asking for nominations for any book eligible for this year\u2019s Booker prize: it has to be a novel, first written in English and published in the UK or Ireland by a British or Irish publisher between 1 October 2018 and 30 September 2019. (US authors are still allowed.) All you need to do is to post a comment naming the book and author below the line, alongside the word \u201cnomination\u201d. We\u2019ll be grateful if you can also name the publisher \u2013 and feel free to say why you like the book. At this stage, we only need one nomination for each title. So if someone else has already nominated your favourite novel, there\u2019s no need to nominate it again \u2013 just tell us what it is about the novel that makes it so great. If you really want to get into the nitty-gritty, you can find all of our terms and conditions here \u2013 and how radiant and beautiful they are. We\u2019re also going to be looking out for three judges from those contributing to the discussion of this year\u2019s shortlist. More on that soon. For now, we need those nominations for our longlist. Let\u2019s go! To nominate a book for the 2019 Not the Booker prize please leave a comment below, including the word \u201cnomination\u201d, with the title and author of one book you think should be considered. If you can supply a publication date, that would be very useful. Nominations will remain open until 23.59 BST on Saturday 27 July 2019.",

Duncan resigned as a Foreign Office minister on Monday before the expected arrival of Johnson at Downing Street, becoming the latest in a string of ministers to pre-emptively quit their jobs in protest at Johnson\u2019s likely direction as prime minister. He then revealed to the BBC that he had applied for a debate to test whether Johnson could command a majority, but was turned down by the Speaker. The motion read: \u201cThat this house has considered the merits of the newly chosen leader of the Conservative party, and supports his wish to form a government\u201d. If he had lost a vote of confidence, Johnson\u2019s tenure in government could have been sunk before it began. However, Tory rebels fighting against a no-deal Brexit have indicated they are prepared to give him a \u201ctime-limited chance\u201d to steer away from that path before they consider bringing him down. Labour is backing away from holding its own confidence motion on Johnson\u2019s government this week because anti-Johnson MPs believe it would probably be won by the likely new prime minister and have the effect of boosting his confidence. The departure of Duncan followed announcements on Sunday by Philip Hammond, the chancellor, and David Gauke, the justice secretary, that they would quit on Wednesday, just before Johnson formally becomes prime minister.

It is part of a wider \u00a350m fundraising by Atom Bank that also drew investment from the Spanish banking group BBVA and investment funds Perscitus and Toscafund.</p> \n<p>But Woodford\u2019s involvement in the funding round failed to excite investors. Instead, shares in the FTSE-250-listed fund fell 1.6% to a new low of 53.1p.</p> \n<p>It is the first major investment decision made by Patient Capital since 3 June, when Woodford made the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/jun/03/neil-woodford-blocks-investors-from-pulling-cash-from-flagship-fund\">shock decision to suspend his flagship Equity Income Fund</a> after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals. It followed a string of bad investments that caused the fund\u2019s performance to nosedive. Woodford was forced to block investors from withdrawing their money from the equity income fund in order to give himself time to sell off stakes in quoted stocks and unlisted companies that can be more difficult to sell.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"a34ab7fd-7b6c-4631-aeaf-bc0eebcb4675\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/neil-woodford\">Neil Woodford</a>&nbsp;was once the UK\u2019s biggest star fund manager, personally managing a \u00a325bn mountain of money on behalf of pension funds and other investors at Invesco Perpetual. When he decided to quit Invesco and go it alone in 2013 it was a huge shock for the fund management industry. Invesco shares slumped by 7% on the day he announced his departure.</p>\n    <p>At Invesco Woodford held control of huge stakes in some of the UK\u2019s biggest firms, and his opinions mattered. His criticism of AstraZeneca chief executive David Brennan in the 2012 shareholder spring was widely regarded to have cost him his job, and his critique of BAE\u2019s attempted \u00a328bn merger with Airbus is acknowledged as one of the reasons the deal collapsed.</p>\n    <p>Woodford, who was widely referred to in the media as an investment \u201chero\u201d and fund management \u201cstar\u201d, had done exceedingly well over his quarter century there. A \u00a31,000 investment placed when he started at the firm in 1988 would have risen to \u00a323,000 by the time he left.</p>\n    <p>Woodford accidentally fell into fund management and hadn\u2019t heard of the term until he rocked up in the City in the 1980s sleeping on his brother\u2019s floor while looking for a job. He got his first break in insurance, before drifting into fund management. He had left school wanting to fly fighter jets but couldn\u2019t pass the RAF\u2019s aptitude test, and instead read economics and agricultural economics at the University of Exeter.</p>\n    <p>Feeling he had outgrown Invesco Perpetual, he set up his own firm Woodford Investment Management in 2014, on an industrial estate near Oxford. Within two weeks of launching, he had raised \u00a31.6bn, a UK record, and it quickly grew to \u00a316bn. In its first full year his flagship fund returned 16% and Woodford, a devotee of veteran US investor Warren Buffett, was dubbed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-27/oracle-of-oxford-sees-red-as-stock-picking-powers-misfire\">\u201cOracle of Oxford\u201d</a>.</p>\n    <p>Asked if he ever doubted his judgment, Woodford once said: \u201cDaily. You must never, as a fund manager, stick your head in the sand saying \u2018everybody go away, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right, I\u2019m right\u2019. You\u2019ve always got to expose yourself to criticism and the analysis that you may be wrong.\u201d</p>\n    <p>Woodford went on to say that the secret of successful fund management was a balance of arrogance and humility. \u201cYou have to have a sufficiently strong arrogant gene to back your judgment, back your conviction. If you didn\u2019t, you would end up with a portfolio that looks very much like the index.

      "bodyText": "Neil Woodford\u2019s stock-market-listed fund has announced its first major investment since the shuttering of its flagship sister vehicle last month. Woodford Patient Capital Trust confirmed on Monday that it was pumping \u00a310m into Atom Bank, keeping its stake at 18%. It is part of a wider \u00a350m fundraising by Atom Bank that also drew investment from the Spanish banking group BBVA and investment funds Perscitus and Toscafund. But Woodford\u2019s involvement in the funding round failed to excite investors. Instead, shares in the FTSE-250-listed fund fell 1.6% to a new low of 53.1p. It is the first major investment decision made by Patient Capital since 3 June, when Woodford made the shock decision to suspend his flagship Equity Income Fund after being overwhelmed by customer withdrawals. It followed a string of bad investments that caused the fund\u2019s performance to nosedive. Woodford was forced to block investors from withdrawing their money from the equity income fund in order to give himself time to sell off stakes in quoted stocks and unlisted companies that can be more difficult to sell. The move trapped more than 290,000 retail clients and their billions of pounds of investments behind the gated fund. The suspension was recently extended by another 28 days to 29 July. While Woodford Patient Capital Trust is not directly affected by the suspension, the move by its sister fund caused a sell-off in its shares and resulted in closer scrutiny of its investments. Its shares have tumbled 32% since the Equity Income Fund was gated. Woodford Patient Capital Trust declined to comment on the new investment. Patient Capital last month followed through on a commitment to hand \u00a320m in funding to Proton Partners, a Hereford-based company focused on cancer treatments using proton beams. However, that funding announcement was originally made in February, before Woodford\u2019s Equity Income Fund was suspended. Atom Bank said it planned to use its fresh funding to fuel growth and investment in technology. Atom, which offers savings accounts, business loans and mortgages, was founded by the former Metro Bank boss Anthony Thomson in 2014.",

      "bodyText": "Live Nation, the world\u2019s largest live music firm, has admitted placing tickets for Metallica directly on to resale websites, despite having claimed that it is against ticket touting. In a secret recording of a telephone call between an associate of Metallica, a Live Nation business partner and a senior Live Nation executive, the executive outlined a plan to bypass the regular avenues by which fans buy tickets at face value. On the 11-minute call leaked to US music website Billboard, the executive can be heard saying that Ticketmaster, Live Nation\u2019s official ticketing subsidiary, \u201cwill not do it\u201d. He discussed sending the tickets direct to secondary ticketing companies, websites such as StubHub and Viagogo that allow touts to sell at large mark-ups. Live Nation admitted that it had placed the tickets, for Metallica\u2019s 2017 WorldWired stadium tour of North America, directly on to the resale market, but insisted that this was unusual. \u201cLive Nation does not have a practice of placing tickets on the secondary market. Our standard practice is to use Ticketmaster\u2019s Platinum, VIP and other tools to help tours price closer to true market value,\u201d said a spokesperson. \u201cIn this situation, a consultant for the band opted to use the secondary market to try to capture that value.\u201d A representative for Metallica told Billboard that the band\u2019s members were unaware of the practice, as the band had delegated the matter to a \u201cticketing consultant\u201d. Live Nation said people associated with Metallica had decided to use the secondary market after realising how much money was being made from their concerts by touts, sometimes known as brokers within the ticketing industry. \u201cIn 2016, Metallica performed a single show in Minneapolis at which more than 10,000 tickets were transacted on the secondary market without the band\u2019s participation,\u201d said the spokesperson. \u201cAfter seeing the volume of secondary transactions for that show and the benefit being captured by brokers, the independent consultant worked with Live Nation on a unique distribution strategy that used the secondary market as a sales distribution channel for select high-end tickets.\u201d Fans and ticket industry sources have long suspected that bands, venues or promoters are leaking tickets directly on to the secondary market, forcing fans to pay more to see their favourite acts, but the allegation has been difficult to prove. Live Nation told Billboard that the Metallica tour was not the only time it had engaged in passing tickets directly to resale sites but said it only did so when musicians asked it to. It said that between 2016 and 2017, \u201cabout a dozen artists out of the thousands we work with asked us to do this\u201d. Adam Webb of FanFair Alliance, which campaigns against industrial-scale online ticket touting, told the Guardian: \u201cThanks to the efforts of government, MPs, the Competition and Markets Authority, the Advertising Standards Authority \u2013 as well as many in the industry \u2013 the UK\u2019s secondary ticketing market is becoming far more regulated. \u201cFor a start, it would be unlawful for an event organiser to put tickets directly on to the secondary market without making a clear disclosure.

The four-tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter, a lander named Vikram after the founder of Isro, and a rover. The rover, named Pragyan, which means \u201cwisdom\u201d in Sanskrit, will spend two weeks traversing the moon\u2019s surface. The six-wheeled vehicle, which will be deployed in early September, will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface, and search for water.</p> \n<p>The lunar south pole is interesting to scientists because they believe water may be present on its vast shadowed areas. The lunar south pole also has craters that are cold traps and which contain a fossil record of the early solar system, according to Isro.</p> \n<p>As well as Chandrayaan-2, India has said it aims to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/15/india-conduct-manned-space-mission-2022-modi\">send three astronauts into space</a> by 2022.</p>",

India launched its first lunar probe in 2008, and guided a spacecraft into orbit around Mars in 2014. Its space programmes are famously thrifty, and its Mars mission, Modi has joked, had a smaller budget than that of the film Gravity. India\u2019s achievements in space have been hailed by Modi as a mark of the country\u2019s rising ambition as a global power. In March, he announced that the country had successfully shot down one of its own satellites with a missile. Though celebrated by Modi as a breakthrough for India\u2019s national security, the missile test was criticised by Nasa for creating hundreds of pieces of orbital debris and threatening astronauts onboard the International Space Station (ISS). The launch of Chandrayaan-2 follows the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landing, and comes amid renewed interest in returning to the moon among states and private industry. In January China landed the Chang\u2019e 4 spacecraft on the previously unexplored far side of the moon, while in April the Israeli spacecraft Beresheet, the first privately funded mission to the moon, crashed after an apparent engine failure. Donald Trump has also said he wants to put astronauts back on the moon by 2024. Chandrayaan-2 \u2013 Sanskrit for \u201cmoon craft\u201d \u2013 is India\u2019s most ambitious space mission yet. Its first lunar mission, Chandrayaan-1, helped to confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did so without landing on the lunar surface. Sivan said carrying out a soft landing would be \u201c15 terrifying minutes\u201d. At the forefront of the Chandrayaan-2 mission are two women. Its project director, Muthayya Vanitha, an electronics system engineer, was named by the science journal Nature as one of five scientists to watch in 2019. It is also being navigated by Ritu Karidhal, who helped to lead India\u2019s Mars mission in 2014. It will take more than six weeks to travel about 238,600 miles (384,000km) to the moon. The four-tonne spacecraft has a lunar orbiter, a lander named Vikram after the founder of Isro, and a rover. The rover, named Pragyan, which means \u201cwisdom\u201d in Sanskrit, will spend two weeks traversing the moon\u2019s surface. The six-wheeled vehicle, which will be deployed in early September, will collect crucial information about the mineral and chemical composition of the lunar surface, and search for water. The lunar south pole is interesting to scientists because they believe water may be present on its vast shadowed areas. The lunar south pole also has craters that are cold traps and which contain a fossil record of the early solar system, according to Isro. As well as Chandrayaan-2, India has said it aims to send three astronauts into space by 2022.",

Late on Monday, police said they had arrested five people \u2013 some of them allegedly Triads \u2013 in relation to the attacks on charges of \u201cunlawful assembly\u201d. On Monday, Yoho Mall, a shopping centre connected to the Yuen Long mass transit station, said some shops had closed amid rumours the armed men would return in the evening. Businesses outside the station in Yuen Long were also closed on Monday afternoon, leaving the normally colourful streets eerily quiet. Local public recreation centres were closed at 7pm due to \u201cpublic safety considerations,\u201d according to Hong Kong\u2019s leisure and cultural services department. Many shops in the normally bustling shopping centres in the towns of Shatin and Tuen Mun have also closed. Hiring men to beat up protesters is not a new tactic, according to activists and observers, who say thugs were also behind attacks on pro-democracy protests in 2014. Men, possibly from southern China, where the practice is more common, heckled and assaulted demonstrators. A widely circulated video showed the pro-Beijing lawmaker Junius Ho, who lives in Yuen Long, shaking hands with men in white and giving them a thumbs up. In response to accusations that he had hired the men to go after protesters, Ho said in a press briefing on Monday that he had nothing to do with the attack. Asked why he did not call the police, Ho said: \u201cThey appeared to be normal residents, just like the protesters in your eyes.\u201d Protesters later covered Ho\u2019s office in pro-democracy sticky notes and threw documents of his over an escalator. Several who covered their faces with scarves and hats later broke down a glass wall of his office in a shopping mall in Tsuen Wan. One poster on the wall stuck on by protesters said: \u201cRural bullies beat up people and carry out terrorist attacks!\u201d In the early hours of Monday, morning police entered a village near the station in Yuen Long where groups of men in white had gathered but said they had seen no weapons and made no arrests because they \u201ccould not be sure of who was involved\u201d. On Monday, Lam and her colleagues were pressed on why police took so long to reach the attacks, even after several people had called emergency services. The police chief, Stephen Lo, said officers, at the time facing down protesters who had amassed near Beijing\u2019s liaison office, had to be redeployed. Lam was criticised after lambasting protesters for their \u201cblatant challenge to national sovereignty\u201d before condemning the Yuen Long attack in statements issued late on Sunday after protesters clashed with police. Asked if she would characterise the attack in Yuen Long as a terrorist attack, Lam said only that she condemned all kinds of violence. The protests, which began over a bill that would allow suspects in Hong Kong to be extradited to mainland China, have take on wider demands, including an investigation into police behaviour. The violence in Yuen Long and the police\u2019s response is likely to be the focus of another protest. On Sunday, thousands of protesters attending a peaceful anti-government march defied the police-sanctioned route and pushed westwards to Beijing\u2019s representative office in Hong Kong, where they graffitied the building\u2019s walls, threw eggs at it, and defaced the emblem of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Speaking outside the building on Monday, Wang Zhimin, the director of Beijing\u2019s liaison office, said an \u201cillegal mob\u201d had \u201cseriously hurt the feelings of the entire Chinese people\u201d. Chinese state media called the attack a \u201cblatant challenge to the central government\u201d. The demonstrations challenge Beijing\u2019s authority over the former British colony, returned to Chinese control in 1997. Under the one country, two systems framework, Hong Kong is meant to maintain a high degree of autonomy from the mainland, with an independent judiciary and a free press. But critics say they have witnessed Hong Kong\u2019s freedoms quickly disappearing. Among protesters\u2019 demands are democratic reforms that would give Hong Kongers the ability to directly elect their leaders. Protest groups have vowed to continue until their demands are met. \u201cI don\u2019t see this ending. It looks like it\u2019s just going to escalate \u2026 it\u2019s almost becoming ungovernable,\u201d said Victoria Hui, a political scientist from Hong Kong, now at Notre Dame University.",

Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched the finale.</em></p> \n<h2>\u2018This is not some put a ribbon on it, bygones be bygones ending, OK?\u2019</h2> \n<p>Ed may have been talking about the renewal of his and Madeline\u2019s vows, but this finale (and perhaps the last ever Big Little Lies) was a put-a-ribbon-on-it send-off. Bathed in blue light, it was an episode dedicated to tying up what few loose ends there really were, and to its characters realising they would tell no more lies. Not even big little ones. The teaser had set up a disintegration of the group, sneakily taking Celeste\u2019s \u201cthe friendship is the lie\u201d line and making it seem as if it would all fall apart for the Monterey Five. Ultimately, though, solidarity prevailed, and as Bonnie made her way to the station to hand herself in, they were right there with her. It was no beach picnic, but it was, in its own way, warm nonetheless.

Don\u2019t read on unless you have watched the finale. \u2018This is not some put a ribbon on it, bygones be bygones ending, OK?\u2019 Ed may have been talking about the renewal of his and Madeline\u2019s vows, but this finale (and perhaps the last ever Big Little Lies) was a put-a-ribbon-on-it send-off. Bathed in blue light, it was an episode dedicated to tying up what few loose ends there really were, and to its characters realising they would tell no more lies. Not even big little ones. The teaser had set up a disintegration of the group, sneakily taking Celeste\u2019s \u201cthe friendship is the lie\u201d line and making it seem as if it would all fall apart for the Monterey Five. Ultimately, though, solidarity prevailed, and as Bonnie made her way to the station to hand herself in, they were right there with her. It was no beach picnic, but it was, in its own way, warm nonetheless. And it was fine, as endings go. The much anticipated courtroom showdown did not play out with the fireworks I expected, though to watch Kidman and Streep go at it with relative restraint, at least at first, was one of the more elegant turns this season.

Former special counsel to testify twice on Wednesday Robert Mueller is preparing to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before two House committees about his report on Russian election interference and the Trump campaign\u2019s links to Moscow. The chairman of the house judiciary committee, Jerrold Nadler, said on Sunday he believed the 448-page report contained \u201csubstantial evidence that the president is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanours\u201d, sufficient to warrant Trump\u2019s impeachment. White supremacy. Trump renewed his racist attacks on the progressive lawmakers known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d on Sunday, while the Democratic presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg suggested white supremacy \u201ccould be the lurking issue that ends this country.\u201d Imran Khan. The president is due to meet the prime minister of Pakistan for the first time on Monday, with Khan hoping to mend relations between the two countries after Trump claimed Pakistan had not done enough to fight extremism. Distracted Britain facing oil tanker standoff with Iran The UK is under increasing pressure to join the US in planning a maritime protection force in the Gulf, after Iran seized a British oil tanker, the Stena Impero, as retaliation for the seizure of one of its own vessels by British forces near Gibraltar earlier this month. Responsibility for managing the crisis falls to Britain\u2019s foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, yet he is busy fighting a leadership contest against Boris Johnson, which Hunt is likely to lose this week \u2013 putting his position as foreign secretary in jeopardy. Radio exchange. A recording has emerged of Iranian coastguards telling a British naval frigate they want to inspect the captured ship for security reasons, contrary to Tehran\u2019s previous claim that the oil tanker had collided with a fishing vessel. Brexit complications. Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a no-deal Brexit is under threat after two top government ministers resigned ahead of Johnson\u2019s likely ascension to the leadership, saying they could not countenance such an outcome. Rossell\u00f3 clings on as Puerto Rico governor Puerto Rico\u2019s embattled governor, Ricardo Rossell\u00f3, has announced he will resign as president of the island\u2019s ruling New Progressive party amid the furore over leaked text messages in which Rossell\u00f3 and his inner circle made misogynistic comments and joked about those who died during Hurricane Maria. Yet he has steadfastly refused to quit as governor, despite 10 days of mass protests against his scandal-plagued administration. Loud voices. The protests have been led in part by some of Puerto Rico\u2019s most famous musicians, including Ricky Martin, Residente and Bad Bunny. US criticism. Top US politicians have also joined the calls for Rossell\u00f3 to resign, from the progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to the conservative Florida senator Rick Scott. Hong Kong police absent as armed gang attacks protesters Hong Kong police have been accused of standing by as a group of armed men dressed in white attacked protesters, including women and children, on their way home from a pro-democracy march. The suspected triads, most wearing masks, stormed a subway station in the city\u2019s Yuen Long district armed with rods and other weapons, leaving 45 people hospitalised, including one in critical condition. Anti-government protests. The attack followed violent clashes between protesters and police at an anti-government march. Police fired teargas and rubber bullets at demonstrators, who had targeted China\u2019s liaison office in the city. Crib sheet The Chinese government has published a paper claiming \u201chostile forces in and outside China\u201d are trying to \u201csplit\u201d the country by suggesting that members of the persecuted Uighur Muslim community are descended from Turks. A 44-year-old rock singer is set to form a coalition government with Ukraine\u2019s sitcom-star president, after exit polls showed him leading the newly created Golos (Voice) party to 6% of the vote in the country\u2019s parliamentary election. A row has broken out between scientific factions over the excavation of Pompeii, which archaeologists say promises remarkable discoveries about Roman life, but vulcanologists claim could destroy crucial information about the eruption that destroyed the city in AD79. Natalie Portman has confirmed her return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the forthcoming sequel Thor: Love and Thunder, in which she will reprise the role of Dr Jane Foster from the 2011 original \u2013 but this time with superhero powers. Must-reads Armed antifascists: \u2018If others have rifles, we\u2019ll have rifles\u2019 In response to the rising threat of the far right, leftist organisations have created their own self-defence groups. And in some cases, they have turned to firearms for protection. Kim Kelly travels to a Trans Pride march with the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club.

With the new remake of The Lion King roaring into cinemas, following the recent live-action versions of Dumbo and Aladdin, Charles Bramesco assesses and ranks the Disney studio\u2019s new, CGI-laden takes on its library of animated classics.

They want to find solutions for other young people and adults outside of Tunis \u2013 the most marginalised in the country \u2013 through social entrepreneurship and the environment to preventing sexual violence. It goes in every direction. The solution for youth is coming from youth.\u201d</p> <p>One possible solution is Cogite, a Tunis-based co-working space that tries to open doors for young entrepreneurs. It provides mentors, access to training, finance and networks. Aside from supporting startup businesses, it has generated jobs itself by choosing some members to run other Cogite co-working spaces across the country.</p> <p>\u201cIf you have a great business model, support network, and access to finance you could go a long way,\u201d says Houeida Anouar, Cogite\u2019s CEO. \u201cAt Cogite, we try to help them build new skills. If you have a great idea but you don\u2019t know how to write a business plan, or don\u2019t know how to pitch a great idea, this is a problem. We facilitate all these aspects for people.\u201d</p> <p>Founded in 2013, Cogite was the first co-working space in the country. Now, there are over 40 in total across cities and in regional areas.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important thing for Cogite was to be a place where people would have access to each other, where collaboration could happen, and a place where there is a lot of inspiration,\u201d she says. \u201cYoung entrepreneurs need to be connected with major players of the economy in Tunisia.\u201d</p> <p>Sahba Sobhani, acting head of Business Call to Action, hopes there will be a domino effect. \u201cThis encouragement of entrepreneurship, the efforts to change the mindset of what kind of opportunities you can grab in Tunisia \u2013 the only way you can do that is seeing others doing it,\u201d he says.</p>",

After finishing my studies, I decided to turn my hobby into a business.\u201d Wenitzky, who works on the Mashrou3i programme, says: \u201cThe programme is able to encourage people to feel that they have the potential to be a change agent \u2013 and entrepreneurship is something they realise can help them take control of their lives.\u201d Utterwulghe adds that there\u2019s a drive among young Tunisians to find solutions for themselves and others. \u201cThey\u2019re very conscious about social difficulties Tunisians face. They want to find solutions for other young people and adults outside of Tunis \u2013 the most marginalised in the country \u2013 through social entrepreneurship and the environment to preventing sexual violence. It goes in every direction. The solution for youth is coming from youth.\u201d One possible solution is Cogite, a Tunis-based co-working space that tries to open doors for young entrepreneurs. It provides mentors, access to training, finance and networks. Aside from supporting startup businesses, it has generated jobs itself by choosing some members to run other Cogite co-working spaces across the country. \u201cIf you have a great business model, support network, and access to finance you could go a long way,\u201d says Houeida Anouar, Cogite\u2019s CEO. \u201cAt Cogite, we try to help them build new skills. If you have a great idea but you don\u2019t know how to write a business plan, or don\u2019t know how to pitch a great idea, this is a problem. We facilitate all these aspects for people.\u201d Founded in 2013, Cogite was the first co-working space in the country. Now, there are over 40 in total across cities and in regional areas. \u201cThe most important thing for Cogite was to be a place where people would have access to each other, where collaboration could happen, and a place where there is a lot of inspiration,\u201d she says. \u201cYoung entrepreneurs need to be connected with major players of the economy in Tunisia.\u201d Sahba Sobhani, acting head of Business Call to Action, hopes there will be a domino effect. \u201cThis encouragement of entrepreneurship, the efforts to change the mindset of what kind of opportunities you can grab in Tunisia \u2013 the only way you can do that is seeing others doing it,\u201d he says.",

It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

We want them out!\u201d Six months later, that excitement \u2013 and with it Castro\u2019s conviction that change is nigh \u2013 is fading. \u201cAt that time, I felt you could reach out and you could grasp it,\u201d the 63-year-old caraque\u00f1a admitted this week. \u201cI don\u2019t have that feeling any more.\u201d When Guaid\u00f3 declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim leader on 23 January \u2013 and was recognised by dozens of foreign governments, including Britain and the US \u2013 the young opposition leader and his backers believed Maduro would fall within days. But half a year later, a massive show of domestic dissent and international pressure has failed to dislodge Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s unpopular successor. \u201cThis was a very high stakes gamble \u2026 and it hasn\u2019t really paid off,\u201d said Phil Gunson, a Caracas-based expert for Crisis Group and author of a report on possible solutions to Venezuela\u2019s crisis. \u201cPlan A has certainly not worked.\u201d That reality has forced Venezuela\u2019s opposition to begin exploring alternatives, particularly after a botched bid to spark a military uprising on 30 April. This month, Guaid\u00f3 and Maduro representatives met on the Caribbean island of Barbados for the latest round of talks optimists hope could lead to free presidential elections in 2020, but which pessimists dismiss as a stalling tactic from Venezuela\u2019s wily authoritarian leader. Guaid\u00f3, meanwhile, has busied himself touring his crisis-stricken country \u2013 he has visited 13 of Venezuela\u2019s 23 states since January \u2013 in an effort to keep his campaign alive. \u201cWe are getting close to a real solution,\u201d he claimed last week. Some have already given up on the 35-year-old politician, amid reports that even Donald Trump \u2013 Guaid\u00f3\u2019s key backer \u2013 is losing interest in his crusade. The commitment of another crucial regional supporter, Jair Bolsonaro, is also in doubt, after Brazil\u2019s far-right president recently dropped a mention of Guaid\u00f3 from a speech for fear of upsetting Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin who, along with China\u2019s Xi Jinping, continues to support Maduro. (On Friday, Bolsonaro said he hoped Russia would \u201chelp resolve the Venezuela question\u201d.) \u201cGuaid\u00f3 is just like the rest of them [in the opposition], he has no plan,\u201d complained Frank Rengifo, a 31-year-old army sergeant who fled over the border into Colombia in mid-March hoping for a US-backed military invasion that never came.

Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 who on Tuesday will mark six months since his challenge with fresh protests \u2013 has retained widespread support. Venezuela\u2019s notoriously fractious opposition has yet to fall apart, despite constant \u201csniping from the wings\u201d from more hardline rivals. Maduro remains in power but is weakened \u2013 to the extent that it was conceivable the military might \u201celbow him aside\u201d and replace him with a junta, Gunson said. But if talks come to nothing, Venezuela\u2019s economic and humanitarian catastrophe would worsen and the future would be bleak. \u201cThere is a real danger this could escalate into some kind of long-term low-intensity armed conflict within Venezuela,\u201d Gunson warned.

      "body": "<p>Kirsten, 22, knew something strange was happening at about eight weeks into her pregnancy. The classic first trimester symptoms, such as weight gain, food aversions and nausea, were all arriving as expected \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t the only one affected.</p> <p>Her partner, Silas, 23, was experiencing similar physical shifts. He started gaining weight and felt repelled by familiar foods. As Kirsten\u2019s morning sickness took hold, he was struck with equally debilitating nausea. \u201cI felt sick every day for weeks,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Initially, Kirsten was sceptical. She worried that Silas\u2019s symptoms were an elaborate joke, or that he was being insensitive. \u201cBut, as time went on, I realised he was truly suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cThe nausea was the worst of it. He had it much worse than I did. I ended up sharing my morning sickness medication with him so he could get through the day.\u201d</p> <p>Silas\u2019s experience was no freak phenomenon. He had Couvade syndrome, otherwise known as a \u201csympathy pregnancy\u201d. The mysterious \u2013 yet surprisingly common \u2013 condition causes pregnant women\u2019s partners to manifest the physical and psychological symptoms of pregnancy. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02646830701467207?src=recsys\" title=\"\">Those with the syndrome report</a> abdominal pain, morning sickness, bloating and lethargy, as well as mood swings, memory loss and depression. In more extreme cases, they can even experience pseudocyesis, in which their stomach swells throughout their partner\u2019s pregnancy, only to begin retracting after the birth.</p> <p>For Kalu, 25, the symptoms were brief, but all-consuming. During the first trimester of his partner\u2019s pregnancy, he struggled with extreme anxiety and nausea. \u201cMy stomach was twisting and turning,\u201d he says. \u201cI was throwing up for days. The only thing I could eat were liquids, such as water and fruit smoothies.\u201d</p> <p>It is easy to dismiss these men as simply being melodramatic, especially when you compare Couvade syndrome with the intense physical strain of a real pregnancy. Perhaps that is why there has been so little research into the causes.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that people understand the nature of the disorder,\u201d says Dr Arthur Brennan, a senior lecturer in nursing at Kingston University, who has written several research papers on the condition. \u201cIt sort of straddles the boundaries between a mental disorder and a physical disorder. It doesn\u2019t fit tidily into one or the other category.\u201d</p> <p>As for how many men may be affected, the research is surprising: one study found that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3486406\" title=\"\">up to 52% of US fathers</a> will experience some symptoms of Couvade syndrome, with <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328695897_Couvade_Syndrome_Among_Jordanian_Expectant_Fathers\" title=\"\">59.1% in Jordan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8496024\" title=\"\">up to 61% in Thailand</a>. In Poland, a 2013 study found that <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235681584_Couvade_Syndrome_among_Polish_expectant_fathers\" title=\"\">72% of expectant fathers</a> could experience at least one pregnancy-related symptom. Lack of research in the UK means that recent statistics are sparse, but estimates in the early 1970s put rates between 11% and 50%. Of course, there is a lot of room for interpretation when symptoms such as mood swings and depression are involved.</p> <p>The syndrome is not a modern-day one. There are references to Couvade rituals in <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T_AfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=corsica+couvade+ritual&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JhjHaS9Lh4&amp;sig=ACfU3U02I5M5p0g8qcZTLUQJZWytBqSAAg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSjMuCk6XjAhVHTRUIHfVGCDwQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=corsica%20couvade%20ritual&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Corsica</a>, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T_AfAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=corsica+couvade+ritual&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JhjHaS9Lh4&amp;sig=ACfU3U02I5M5p0g8qcZTLUQJZWytBqSAAg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiSjMuCk6XjAhVHTRUIHfVGCDwQ6AEwCXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=corsica%20couvade%20ritual&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">Cyprus</a>, <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/medicine/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/couvade-syndrome\" title=\"\">Papua New Guinea</a> and <a href=\"https://ttu-ir.tdl.org/bitstream/handle/2346/23304/31295018714302.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y\" title=\"\">ancient Iberia</a> that stretch as far back as 50BC, with expectant fathers apparently lying in bed throughout the pregnancy, and receiving the same level of attention as mothers. In some cases, they would even wear their partner\u2019s clothes, groan and cry out, and complain of labour pains.</p> <p>Couvade syndrome may not be limited to heterosexual human couples, although they make up the majority of the reported cases. Dr Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, says the most severe case of Couvade syndrome he has ever heard of came via a vet: \u201cA woman developed a variant of Couvade syndrome triggered by her dog\u2019s pregnancy: she had all the symptoms of the syndrome, and she knew she was not pregnant.\u201d</p> <p>So what does cause Couvade syndrome? For a long time, it was believed to be purely psychological. Some <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/26/why-some-men-develop-signs-of-pregnancy/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.cdd64d6f1b61\" title=\"\">early explanations</a>, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, suggested that the symptoms were born out of a man\u2019s envy of the woman\u2019s ability to procreate. Others suggested it could be a way of diverting attention back to the man, who can feel irrelevant or marginalised during pregnancy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Amanda is pregnant, I just get emotional and lazy, and eat cake</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But more recent studies have suggested that Couvade syndrome could be linked to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235681584_Couvade_Syndrome_among_Polish_expectant_fathers\" title=\"\">empathy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/09/26/why-some-men-develop-signs-of-pregnancy/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.0aa0cd853ba3\" title=\"\">attachment</a>. Symptoms, it seems, are more prevalent in men with greater investment in their unborn baby, and increased involvement in the pregnancy.</p> <p>This was the case for Mike, 32. The tattoo artist had Couvade syndrome with all three of his partner Amanda\u2019s pregnancies, experiencing morning sickness, pseudocyesis, exhaustion and heightened emotions. He believes it may have been down to the couple\u2019s closeness. \u201cWe breathe each other\u2019s air constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cWe own a couple of businesses together, we live together, we work together and we have children together, so we\u2019re very close. We also spend a lot of our free time together, too, because we\u2019re friends.\u201d</p> <p>There are potential physical explanations for Couvade syndrome. What we know from the very few studies that have been carried out so far is that men\u2019s hormonal levels shift significantly during the antenatal period.

      "bodyText": "Kirsten, 22, knew something strange was happening at about eight weeks into her pregnancy. The classic first trimester symptoms, such as weight gain, food aversions and nausea, were all arriving as expected \u2013 but she wasn\u2019t the only one affected. Her partner, Silas, 23, was experiencing similar physical shifts. He started gaining weight and felt repelled by familiar foods. As Kirsten\u2019s morning sickness took hold, he was struck with equally debilitating nausea. \u201cI felt sick every day for weeks,\u201d he says. Initially, Kirsten was sceptical. She worried that Silas\u2019s symptoms were an elaborate joke, or that he was being insensitive. \u201cBut, as time went on, I realised he was truly suffering,\u201d she says. \u201cThe nausea was the worst of it. He had it much worse than I did. I ended up sharing my morning sickness medication with him so he could get through the day.\u201d Silas\u2019s experience was no freak phenomenon. He had Couvade syndrome, otherwise known as a \u201csympathy pregnancy\u201d. The mysterious \u2013 yet surprisingly common \u2013 condition causes pregnant women\u2019s partners to manifest the physical and psychological symptoms of pregnancy. Those with the syndrome report abdominal pain, morning sickness, bloating and lethargy, as well as mood swings, memory loss and depression. In more extreme cases, they can even experience pseudocyesis, in which their stomach swells throughout their partner\u2019s pregnancy, only to begin retracting after the birth. For Kalu, 25, the symptoms were brief, but all-consuming. During the first trimester of his partner\u2019s pregnancy, he struggled with extreme anxiety and nausea. \u201cMy stomach was twisting and turning,\u201d he says. \u201cI was throwing up for days. The only thing I could eat were liquids, such as water and fruit smoothies.\u201d It is easy to dismiss these men as simply being melodramatic, especially when you compare Couvade syndrome with the intense physical strain of a real pregnancy. Perhaps that is why there has been so little research into the causes. \u201cI don\u2019t think that people understand the nature of the disorder,\u201d says Dr Arthur Brennan, a senior lecturer in nursing at Kingston University, who has written several research papers on the condition. \u201cIt sort of straddles the boundaries between a mental disorder and a physical disorder. It doesn\u2019t fit tidily into one or the other category.\u201d As for how many men may be affected, the research is surprising: one study found that up to 52% of US fathers will experience some symptoms of Couvade syndrome, with 59.1% in Jordan and up to 61% in Thailand. In Poland, a 2013 study found that 72% of expectant fathers could experience at least one pregnancy-related symptom. Lack of research in the UK means that recent statistics are sparse, but estimates in the early 1970s put rates between 11% and 50%. Of course, there is a lot of room for interpretation when symptoms such as mood swings and depression are involved. The syndrome is not a modern-day one. There are references to Couvade rituals in Corsica, Cyprus, Papua New Guinea and ancient Iberia that stretch as far back as 50BC, with expectant fathers apparently lying in bed throughout the pregnancy, and receiving the same level of attention as mothers. In some cases, they would even wear their partner\u2019s clothes, groan and cry out, and complain of labour pains. Couvade syndrome may not be limited to heterosexual human couples, although they make up the majority of the reported cases. Dr Bartlomiej Piechowski-Jozwiak, a neurologist at Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, says the most severe case of Couvade syndrome he has ever heard of came via a vet: \u201cA woman developed a variant of Couvade syndrome triggered by her dog\u2019s pregnancy: she had all the symptoms of the syndrome, and she knew she was not pregnant.\u201d So what does cause Couvade syndrome? For a long time, it was believed to be purely psychological. Some early explanations, rooted in psychoanalytic theory, suggested that the symptoms were born out of a man\u2019s envy of the woman\u2019s ability to procreate. Others suggested it could be a way of diverting attention back to the man, who can feel irrelevant or marginalised during pregnancy. But more recent studies have suggested that Couvade syndrome could be linked to empathy and attachment. Symptoms, it seems, are more prevalent in men with greater investment in their unborn baby, and increased involvement in the pregnancy. This was the case for Mike, 32. The tattoo artist had Couvade syndrome with all three of his partner Amanda\u2019s pregnancies, experiencing morning sickness, pseudocyesis, exhaustion and heightened emotions. He believes it may have been down to the couple\u2019s closeness. \u201cWe breathe each other\u2019s air constantly,\u201d he says. \u201cWe own a couple of businesses together, we live together, we work together and we have children together, so we\u2019re very close. We also spend a lot of our free time together, too, because we\u2019re friends.\u201d There are potential physical explanations for Couvade syndrome. What we know from the very few studies that have been carried out so far is that men\u2019s hormonal levels shift significantly during the antenatal period. Testosterone tends to diminish, while oestrogen and prolactin rise. \u201cI\u2019d say my oestrogen levels were all over the place when Amanda was pregnant,\u201d says Mike. \u201cI was an emotional wreck.\u201d \u201cMy training regime practically stopped because I didn\u2019t feel like I had the urge or energy. I\u2019m quite a testosterone-y bloke: I\u2019m mad on the gym, and I train hard and often. But when Amanda is pregnant, that just stops. My \u2018want\u2019 just disappears. I just get emotional and lazy, and eat cake.\u201d Dr Robin Edelstein, a psychologist from the University of Michigan, has studied these hormonal shifts in expectant fathers.

      "body": "<p>There is a word that all Asians hope never to hear but many cannot avoid. The P-word. It came Yan Dhanda\u2019s way when he was very young and playing football with friends in a park near his family home in Tipton, and while the details are sketchy he remembers easily the shocking nature of the abuse.</p> <p>\u201cIt was from random people who\u2019d either be playing with me and my friends or against us,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019d say things like, \u2018he\u2019s a Paki, he\u2019s never going to make it [as a footballer]\u2019. I\u2019ve also heard it a few times since \u2013 \u2018Paki this, Paki that\u2019, again from random people. But it never affected me. It just made me want to prove those people wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Which Dhanda has. Aged 20, he has gone from the local park to becoming part of the first-team squad at Swansea City, via youth-level spells at West Bromwich Albion and Liverpool. He has also been capped at Under-16 and Under-17 level for England, with more expected to come from a player of promising technical and creative gifts. And then there is Dhanda\u2019s broader impact \u2013 one of the very few professional players in this county who is of Asian descent, making him a standard-bearer for a community that continues to be woefully under-represented in the game. Given his age, Dhanda could deem that too big a responsibility. Instead, he relishes it.</p> <p>That much can be taken from his willingness to be part of the Football Association\u2019s Bringing Opportunities to Communities strategy, which was launched four years ago and is designed to increase Asian representation right across English football. As part of a fresh push, the FA plans to appoint an \u201cAsian champion\u201d to the governing body\u2019s board and, alongside a host of other measures, has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edPNPflDgdk&amp;feature=youtu.be)\" title=\"\">produced a film featuring four Asian role models</a> \u2013 referee Lisa Rashid, England Women\u2019s deaf futsal player Lucindha Lawson, Charlton Women\u2019s manager Riteesh Mishra and Dhanda.</p> <p>\u201cI got a call from someone at the FA asking if I\u2019d get involved and I jumped at the opportunity,\u201d he says. \u201cGrowing up, I never really thought about why there were so few Asians in football \u2013 I was purely focused on making it myself. But now it does ring alarm bells.\u201d</p> <p>The numbers around this issue are stark. People of Asian descent have lived in Britain for decades and, in England specifically, represent 8% of the population. Yet historically there has been very few who have played professionally in the country with the current total, according to the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, standing at 12. Add in the lack of coaches and managers and it is little wonder many Asians feel detached from the national game, and why the \u201crandom people\u201d Dhanda came across in Tipton felt emboldened enough to claim he and those of a similar background would not, and could not, make the grade.</p> <p>Dhanda\u2019s mental toughness meant he did not wilt under the abuse. He also benefited from something most Asians growing up on these shores do not have \u2013 a football role model: his father, Jaz. \u201cHe played for Tipton Town,\u201d Dhanda says. \u201cMy uncle also played for them and from the age of five I\u2019d go watch them, so for me it was normal seeing Asians play football.</p> <p>\u201cMy dad also helped me deal with racism. From a young age he told me that if people said horrible stuff to me they were stupid and I should just ignore them. Which is what I\u2019ve always done\u201d</p> <p>Dhanda is mixed race: English on his mother\u2019s side and Punjabi on his father\u2019s. Along with Jaz and other members of his family and friends, he visited Punjab recently to learn more about his roots as well as inspire youngsters in the region \u2013 \u201cI went to different schools and spoke to the kids there about my life. They seemed to enjoy it.\u201d Back in Swansea, the focus for Dhanda is on inspiring Asians through his performances on the pitch, something he struggled to do last season having swapped Merseyside for south Wales on a free transfer.</p> <p>The midfielder made a blistering start, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/04/sheffield-united-swansea-city-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">scoring with his first touch in senior football</a> to secure a 2-1 victory away to Sheffield United on the opening day of the Championship campaign. But there followed only five more first-team appearances as then manager Graham Potter deemed him physically short of what was required. Dhanda, a naturally slight athlete, accepted he needed to work on bulking up and that is what he has been doing since returning from India in the hope of impressing Steve Cooper, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/10/swansea-managerial-vacancy-steve-cooper-england-under-17s\" title=\"\">who replaced Potter last month</a> following his switch to Brighton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0471f9c29380e4365a4e9b0aa1fc703636052e1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0471f9c29380e4365a4e9b0aa1fc703636052e1e/0_138_4373_2624/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yan Dhanda celebrates scoring Swansea\u2019s winning goal against Sheffield United on the opening day of last season\u2019s Championship.

It was his first touch in senior football.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robbie Stephenson/JMP/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve spoken with the manager and it\u2019s clear everyone in the squad has a fresh start under him,\u201d Dhanda says on a warm afternoon at Swansea\u2019s picturesque training ground on the outskirts of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to take our chance when we get it and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d</p> <p>Dhanda is well thought of at Swansea and there is no desire there to give up on a player who Liverpool took a punt on when he was just 14. Ultimately Dhanda did not make the grade at Anfield, but he has no regrets about his six years there. \u201cI trained with the first team a lot for someone of my age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was amazing to be on the same pitch as Gerrard, Sterling and Coutinho. Coutinho is the best player I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s also one of the nicest. From the first time he saw me, he came over and made me feel welcome. He also followed me on Instagram.\u201d</p> <p>Our conversation soon returns to the lack of Asians in English football and what, beyond the FA\u2019s scheme, can be done to increase numbers. Dhanda suggests more clubs could replicate Chelsea\u2019s Asian Star initiative, which has been <a href=\"https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/05/18/asian-star-marks-10th-anniversary-with-success-at-stamford-bridg\" title=\"\">running for a decade</a> and sees hundreds of children take part in a series of activities aimed at increasing Asian participation in, and enthusiasm for, football. \u201cI took part in it nine years ago,\u201d Dhanda says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great scheme that should be on offer elsewhere.\u201d</p> <p>Within clubs there also has to be a shifting of attitudes, with anecdotal evidence suggesting coaches across the board are writing off Asians at a young age because of a perception that they lack the dedication required to make it professionally. It is a lazy stereotype but, as is the case with many stereotypes, also based in experience. Quite simply, too many Asian parents have put off \u2013 and even prevented \u2013 their children from becoming involved in football, directing them instead towards more academic professions, namely medicine and law.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that doesn\u2019t happen, because it does,\u201d says Dhanda. \u201cBut in the next few generations things will be different. I\u2019ve got friends who have kids and they\u2019ve told me that if they want to get into football, they\u2019ll support them in that. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s also the case with other young Asian parents.\u201d</p> <p>Among the dozen Asians currently playing professionally in this country there is Stoke\u2019s Danny Batth, who is of Sikh-Punjabi descent, Aston Villa and Wales defender Neil Taylor, whose mother is a Bengali from Kolkata, and the man who may ultimately make the biggest impact of all \u2013 Leicester\u2019s Hamza Choudhury. The midfielder, whose mother is of Bangladeshi origin, was part of the England Under-21 squad that took part in the recent European Championship in Italy, and while his main contribution was a challenge in the opening game against France that rightly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/19/hamza-choudhury-england-under-21-red-card-never-felt-worse-apologises\" title=\"\">led to him being sent off</a>, he is seen as a star of the future, at club and international level.</p> <p>\u201cHamza\u2019s a friend of mine but I hate playing against him because he\u2019s so good,\u201d Dhanda says with a laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper player and seeing him play in the Premier League makes me want to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important that as many Asians as possible make it at the highest level. We\u2019re role models for the next generation and they need to see football is for them. If you love doing something and want to make it your career, you should be able to do so, regardless of your background.\u201d</p>",

Add in the lack of coaches and managers and it is little wonder many Asians feel detached from the national game, and why the \u201crandom people\u201d Dhanda came across in Tipton felt emboldened enough to claim he and those of a similar background would not, and could not, make the grade. Dhanda\u2019s mental toughness meant he did not wilt under the abuse. He also benefited from something most Asians growing up on these shores do not have \u2013 a football role model: his father, Jaz. \u201cHe played for Tipton Town,\u201d Dhanda says. \u201cMy uncle also played for them and from the age of five I\u2019d go watch them, so for me it was normal seeing Asians play football. \u201cMy dad also helped me deal with racism. From a young age he told me that if people said horrible stuff to me they were stupid and I should just ignore them. Which is what I\u2019ve always done\u201d Dhanda is mixed race: English on his mother\u2019s side and Punjabi on his father\u2019s. Along with Jaz and other members of his family and friends, he visited Punjab recently to learn more about his roots as well as inspire youngsters in the region \u2013 \u201cI went to different schools and spoke to the kids there about my life. They seemed to enjoy it.\u201d Back in Swansea, the focus for Dhanda is on inspiring Asians through his performances on the pitch, something he struggled to do last season having swapped Merseyside for south Wales on a free transfer. The midfielder made a blistering start, scoring with his first touch in senior football to secure a 2-1 victory away to Sheffield United on the opening day of the Championship campaign. But there followed only five more first-team appearances as then manager Graham Potter deemed him physically short of what was required. Dhanda, a naturally slight athlete, accepted he needed to work on bulking up and that is what he has been doing since returning from India in the hope of impressing Steve Cooper, who replaced Potter last month following his switch to Brighton. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with the manager and it\u2019s clear everyone in the squad has a fresh start under him,\u201d Dhanda says on a warm afternoon at Swansea\u2019s picturesque training ground on the outskirts of the city. \u201cIt\u2019s up to us to take our chance when we get it and that\u2019s what I intend to do.\u201d Dhanda is well thought of at Swansea and there is no desire there to give up on a player who Liverpool took a punt on when he was just 14. Ultimately Dhanda did not make the grade at Anfield, but he has no regrets about his six years there. \u201cI trained with the first team a lot for someone of my age,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was amazing to be on the same pitch as Gerrard, Sterling and Coutinho. Coutinho is the best player I\u2019ve ever seen. He\u2019s also one of the nicest. From the first time he saw me, he came over and made me feel welcome. He also followed me on Instagram.\u201d Our conversation soon returns to the lack of Asians in English football and what, beyond the FA\u2019s scheme, can be done to increase numbers. Dhanda suggests more clubs could replicate Chelsea\u2019s Asian Star initiative, which has been running for a decade and sees hundreds of children take part in a series of activities aimed at increasing Asian participation in, and enthusiasm for, football. \u201cI took part in it nine years ago,\u201d Dhanda says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great scheme that should be on offer elsewhere.\u201d Within clubs there also has to be a shifting of attitudes, with anecdotal evidence suggesting coaches across the board are writing off Asians at a young age because of a perception that they lack the dedication required to make it professionally. It is a lazy stereotype but, as is the case with many stereotypes, also based in experience. Quite simply, too many Asian parents have put off \u2013 and even prevented \u2013 their children from becoming involved in football, directing them instead towards more academic professions, namely medicine and law. \u201cWe can\u2019t pretend that doesn\u2019t happen, because it does,\u201d says Dhanda. \u201cBut in the next few generations things will be different. I\u2019ve got friends who have kids and they\u2019ve told me that if they want to get into football, they\u2019ll support them in that. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s also the case with other young Asian parents.\u201d Among the dozen Asians currently playing professionally in this country there is Stoke\u2019s Danny Batth, who is of Sikh-Punjabi descent, Aston Villa and Wales defender Neil Taylor, whose mother is a Bengali from Kolkata, and the man who may ultimately make the biggest impact of all \u2013 Leicester\u2019s Hamza Choudhury. The midfielder, whose mother is of Bangladeshi origin, was part of the England Under-21 squad that took part in the recent European Championship in Italy, and while his main contribution was a challenge in the opening game against France that rightly led to him being sent off, he is seen as a star of the future, at club and international level. \u201cHamza\u2019s a friend of mine but I hate playing against him because he\u2019s so good,\u201d Dhanda says with a laugh. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper player and seeing him play in the Premier League makes me want to do the same. \u201cIt\u2019s important that as many Asians as possible make it at the highest level. We\u2019re role models for the next generation and they need to see football is for them. If you love doing something and want to make it your career, you should be able to do so, regardless of your background.\u201d",

This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.</p>\n    <p>Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.</p>\n    <p>The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs divide in the Irish Sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.</p>\n    <p>Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u2019s customs union permanently if the UK &amp; EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was added to May\u2019s withdrawal agreement?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><b>Joint interpretative instrument&nbsp;</b><br></p>\n    <p>A legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try to get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU\u2019s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.</p>\n    <p><b>Unilateral statement from the UK&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This set out the British position that, if the backstop were to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.</p>\n    <p><b>Additional language in political declaration&nbsp;</b></p>\n    <p>This emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like.

In his Telegraph column on Monday, he condemned the \u201ctechnological pessimists\u201d who said this was impossible in the available time, adding: \u201cIt is absurd that we have even allowed ourselves to be momentarily delayed by these technical issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP MP who is the party\u2019s chief whip at Westminster, said he believed technology could \u201cplay a part in addressing this issue\u201d, but warned that the timescales appeared difficult.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether there will be enough time between now and the deadline in October to get agreement with the EU on what that technology would look like,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> \n<p>It might be possible to complete the task before the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of 2020, Donaldson added. \u201cBut we would have to have agreement with the EU on this, otherwise we\u2019re looking at a no-deal situation, and our preference is we leave the EU with a deal. But that means finding a way to address the concerns around the backstop.\u201d</p> \n<p>While the DUP\u2019s confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservatives would still be in place if Johnson took over, there would be some renegotiation, Donaldson noted.</p> \n<p>He said: \u201cWe\u2019re about to enter phase two of the confidence and supply agreement, and we will of course be negotiating the arrangements for the next stage of our support for the government.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking on Talk Radio, the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who is likely to return to the cabinet under Johnson, also called for \u201ca bit more optimism about the enterprise we\u2019re embarked on\u201d.</p> \n<p>A change of PM should make a big difference on Brexit, Raab said. \u201cSome of the challenges remain the same, but the difference is, first of all, we had a prime minister who has resigned because the deal hit the buffers and clearly cannot get through parliament.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat is a fact for the UK and the EU. Secondly, if Boris wins, but I\u2019m reasonably confident we\u2019ve got a prime minister that will stick to the plan of saying we either get a deal that is acceptable to the UK or we\u2019ll leave on WTO terms.\u201d</p>",

In his Telegraph column on Monday, he condemned the \u201ctechnological pessimists\u201d who said this was impossible in the available time, adding: \u201cIt is absurd that we have even allowed ourselves to be momentarily delayed by these technical issues.\u201d Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP MP who is the party\u2019s chief whip at Westminster, said he believed technology could \u201cplay a part in addressing this issue\u201d, but warned that the timescales appeared difficult. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether there will be enough time between now and the deadline in October to get agreement with the EU on what that technology would look like,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. It might be possible to complete the task before the end of the Brexit transition period at the end of 2020, Donaldson added. \u201cBut we would have to have agreement with the EU on this, otherwise we\u2019re looking at a no-deal situation, and our preference is we leave the EU with a deal. But that means finding a way to address the concerns around the backstop.\u201d While the DUP\u2019s confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservatives would still be in place if Johnson took over, there would be some renegotiation, Donaldson noted. He said: \u201cWe\u2019re about to enter phase two of the confidence and supply agreement, and we will of course be negotiating the arrangements for the next stage of our support for the government.\u201d Speaking on Talk Radio, the former Brexit secretary Dominic Raab, who is likely to return to the cabinet under Johnson, also called for \u201ca bit more optimism about the enterprise we\u2019re embarked on\u201d. A change of PM should make a big difference on Brexit, Raab said. \u201cSome of the challenges remain the same, but the difference is, first of all, we had a prime minister who has resigned because the deal hit the buffers and clearly cannot get through parliament. \u201cThat is a fact for the UK and the EU. Secondly, if Boris wins, but I\u2019m reasonably confident we\u2019ve got a prime minister that will stick to the plan of saying we either get a deal that is acceptable to the UK or we\u2019ll leave on WTO terms.\u201d",

In Brisbane members of a separate group, Galilee Blockade, blocked access to the headquarters of a concrete pumping company that has worked for Adani.

Plus, more national security, where the Howard line of <strong>\u201c</strong><strong>whose side are you on?\u201d</strong> will no doubt make a million more appearances. So many so, that even <strong>Michael McCormack</strong> might manage to get it right. </p> <p>In case you didn\u2019t notice it today, it was the line the Morrison government trotted out for practically every issue. And they won\u2019t stop.</p> <p>From now on, I am going to answer every question I don\u2019t like with something similar. The government obviously thinks it is effective and it has put Labor on the defensive all day \u2013 given the party is now having to say it is on the side of Australians.</p> <p>This is the quality of debate. National security has been bipartisan since the Howard years, and yet every single time a question is raised, we get a \u201cwhose side are you on?\u201d response.

It must not end up as a slush fund for big corporate agribusiness, leaving struggling farmers high and dry,\u201d Senator Rice said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are four issues that the Greens seek to amend and look forward to support for them from across the parliament:<br> </p> <ol> <li>We must significantly increase parliamentary oversight of the Drought Minister. This bill gives far too much leeway to the Minister and his National Party mates to pick and choose what projects get funded.<br> </li> <li>We must ensure the integrity of the Murray Darling Basin plan and of our national water laws.<br> </li> <li>Make sure that this bill does not rip $3.9 billion out of the Building Australia Fund. Our cities and regions are already experiencing chronic underinvestment in transport infrastructure. Instead propose that the monies for the fund should come from the billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks given to the fossil fuel industry who should pay to clean up their own mess.<br> </li> <li>Finally, it needs to be crystal clear that the investment vehicle for this fund must not invest in fossil fuels. It would be the peak of cynicism to have a drought fund that is designed to help our regions adapt to the impacts of climate change simultaneously investing in the very industries that are causing

Prime minister, you\u2019ve spoken about Australia\u2019s step-up, but there are some growing calls for Australia to step down from offshore detention. Prime minister Marape, would you like to see the Manus Island detention centre closed? And prime minister Morrison, are you prepared to do that if that\u2019s what the prime minister asks of Australia?</p> <p><strong>Morrison:</strong> <strong>Let me start off by saying that the detention centre on Manus Island is closed, has been closed for some time. There is no detention centre on Manus Island. I think it\u2019s important that Australians are no longer told that somehow there is a detention centre that\u2019s operating on Manus Island. </strong>That has been a process we\u2019ve been working through now for some time. The accommodation facility at East Lorengau which now accommodates, there are about 300-odd people on Manus Island currently who are refugees and that is down from 1,353 at the peak when Labor were in power. So we\u2019ve made substantial progress. The detention centre at Lombrum is closed and we\u2019re working very closely together with the PNG government in terms of the service arrangements which continue for those who continue to be resident on Manus Island. And that includes a tender process on the contract which has had a lot of attention on it here, which we mutually agreed would be put in place and the existing contract extended until that tender process had been completed to allow a new service provider to step up. Prime minister?</p> <p><strong>Marape:</strong> <strong>Yes, as confirmed by prime minister Morrison, there is no more detention. People are living freely in Manus, and also some have moved to Port Moresby for medical reasons and are moving around freely.</strong> And I\u2019ve expressed clearly to minister Dutton that we need to establish a schedule and timetable towards full closure of the entire asylum processes. PNG has always stood in, and stepped in to assist Australia in times of need, as you have always done to us also. We will ensure that we have a mutually workable timetable and closer program that is healthy for all of us, but more importantly, healthy for those people who have been part of us in Manus and now in PNG for some time now. Some are classified as refugees. Those who are classified as refugees, the international convention on refugees and resettlement will apply. Some are not classified as refugees; we\u2019ll work with them to ensure they resettle, given encouragement to move back to their home of origin or where they\u2019d like to move. Those are works in process that both governments have agreed to establish a schedule going forward. And for us, to find some closure in the Manus asylum seekers. <strong>But let me agree with prime minister Morrison: there is no more detention</strong>. We\u2019re in the process of resettling the entire people out from PNG, within PNG, and common decency will apply to those human beings who are with us in Port Moresby and Manus right now.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T06:34:59.036Z\">at 7.34am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3557918f0845f89e311d2b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T06:29:18.591Z\">7.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Larissa Waters </strong>is next up on Afternoon Briefing.

That is not my concern. My concern is that members of that era, of Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop, were very well looked after by the old parliamentary superannuation scheme so I think they should have particular regard and respect for any decisions that they take soon after leaving politics in regard to the parliament and former members and to those members who have to carry on into the processes of governing ...</p> <p>I think we need to defend that trust because in the past we have let the public down too often as individuals and then probably when governments have said one thing and done another, on both sides of the House. It is not a broad accusation, it is just the way the public see us. </p> <p>I am very close to my community and have been for a long time and know what they feel. At the football club they could not care less what Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop are doing at the moment, they are worried about the kids and their hopes and aspirations for the future and just having a job.

Less than 20% of people on Newstart receive a family tax benefit, which goes to helping cover the cost of raising children. <br></p> <p>\u201cWhen we look at who is on Newstart, we see that half of recipients are over the age of 45; more than 100,000 are single parents; and one in four have an illness or disability but cannot get the disability support pension. <br></p> <p>\u201cOlder people, people with disability and single parents face challenges and discrimination in finding paid work and this is part of the reason why the average time spent on Newstart is three years. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe reality for people on Newstart is that they are living in deep financial crisis that severely restricts their chance of finding paid work.

People are living freely in Manus, and also some have moved to Port Moresby for medical, and moving around freely. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>And I\u2019ve expressed clearly to minister Dutton that we need to establish a schedule and timetable towards full closure of the entire asylum processes.</strong> As PNG has always stood in to assist Australia in times of need, as it has done for us also, we will ensure that we have a mutually workable timetable and closer program that is healthy for all of us, but more importantly, healthy for those people who have been part of us in Manus and PNG. Some are classified as refugees. </p> <p>\u201cThose classified as final refugee, the international convention of refugees will apply. Those who aren\u2019t classified as refugees, we\u2019ll see where they\u2019re given encouragement to move back to their home of origin or where they\u2019d like to move. </p> <p>\u201cThose are works in process that both governments have agreed to. And for us, to find some closure in the Manus area. But let me agree with prime minister Morrison, there is no more detention. We\u2019re in the process of resettling the entire people out from PNG, within PNG, and common decency will apply to the people who are with us in Port Moresby and Manus now.\u201d</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T02:43:21.409Z\">at 3.43am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5d3519f38f0845f89e311bce\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-22T02:07:23.334Z\">3.07am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>James Marape:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We come to Australia as friend and family, as prime minister <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> has indicated. </p> <p>[The] meeting this morning was to consolidate on some of the issues that we need to build on as leader to leader, that will set the pace for our ministers to have their dialogue, and we will consolidate going into the future. </p> <p>The future for PNG is not a future of economy and security.

      "bodyText": "And as Labor\u2019s motion on the Future Drought Fund heads to its inevitable defeat (the government has the majority in the House) we are going to close up the blog. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow. One, because we love it, and two, because I love getting paid. It\u2019s party room and caucus day, so we\u2019ll bring you that. Plus, more national security, where the Howard line of \u201cwhose side are you on?\u201d will no doubt make a million more appearances. So many so, that even Michael McCormack might manage to get it right. In case you didn\u2019t notice it today, it was the line the Morrison government trotted out for practically every issue. And they won\u2019t stop. From now on, I am going to answer every question I don\u2019t like with something similar. The government obviously thinks it is effective and it has put Labor on the defensive all day \u2013 given the party is now having to say it is on the side of Australians. This is the quality of debate. National security has been bipartisan since the Howard years, and yet every single time a question is raised, we get a \u201cwhose side are you on?\u201d response. Putting the words national security into a speech or piece of legislation shouldn\u2019t give you carte blanche to do whatever you want, but it has become to mean that over the last couple of decades. So now we have seen how the government intends to move on, we need to see how the rest of the parliament will react. A massive thank you to everyone who joined us today \u2013 and to Mike Bowers and the brains trust for all that they do. Big ups to Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin for keeping me informed, fed and caffeinated, and all the secret squirrels who let me know what is happening around the traps. As always, thank you to you for choosing to spend some of your time with us. We appreciate it and all of your comments, emails and tweets. You\u2019ll find some behind the scenes, as well as a morning update, here on Instagram, and you\u2019ll catch me here bright and early tomorrow morning. And remember \u2013 take care of you. While Labor\u2019s attempt to move a motion on the Future Drought Fund is about to go down in the House (where the government holds the numbers), the Greens will attempt to amend the legislation in the Senate. From Janet Rice: \u201cAny spending on drought must support farmers in building resilience to face our climate crisis, helping them to use less water and regenerate damaged land and soils. It must not end up as a slush fund for big corporate agribusiness, leaving struggling farmers high and dry,\u201d Senator Rice said. \u201cThere are four issues that the Greens seek to amend and look forward to support for them from across the parliament: We must significantly increase parliamentary oversight of the Drought Minister. This bill gives far too much leeway to the Minister and his National Party mates to pick and choose what projects get funded. We must ensure the integrity of the Murray Darling Basin plan and of our national water laws. Make sure that this bill does not rip $3.9 billion out of the Building Australia Fund. Our cities and regions are already experiencing chronic underinvestment in transport infrastructure. Instead propose that the monies for the fund should come from the billions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks given to the fossil fuel industry who should pay to clean up their own mess. Finally, it needs to be crystal clear that the investment vehicle for this fund must not invest in fossil fuels. It would be the peak of cynicism to have a drought fund that is designed to help our regions adapt to the impacts of climate change simultaneously investing in the very industries that are causing it.\u201d Some of the day, as seen by Mike Bowers Full text of Tony Burke\u2019s motion: That the House: 1) notes that: (a) the Government first introduced the Future Drought Fund Bill and Future Drought Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill into the House of Representatives in November last year; (b) the Government failed to prioritise the bills, with the Future Drought Fund Bill being introduced but never debated in the Senate, and the Future Drought Fund (Consequential Amendments) Bill never passing the House; (c) the Government introduced 26 bills into the House of Representatives last sitting week but these bills were not among them; (d) today, the Government is seeking to both introduce and debate the amended bills on the one day; (e) it is usual for bills to be introduced by the Government in one sitting week and not debated until the following sitting week to allow Members the opportunity to properly consider bills before voting on them; and (f) the drought funding in these bills is not available to help farmers until 1 July 2020; and 2) therefore, calls on the Government to adjourn debate on these bills immediately following the Minister\u2019s speech on the second reading to allow all Members the opportunity to properly consider these bills before debate resumes tomorrow. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, has moved a motion to resume debate on the drought fund bill after the minister\u2019s second reading speech tomorrow. Labor is infuriated that the government is rushing the bill through to wedge the opposition before it can consider it at caucus on Tuesday. Burke says the the motion \u201cwill make no difference at all to the timing of drought assistance\u201d (because the bill can still pass by week\u2019s end) and Labor is attempting to draw the line to prevent it becoming \u201cstandard practice for legislation to be rushed through without being read\u201d. Burke says rushing the legislation through is a \u201creally dumb idea\u201d and makes vague threats that \u201cif the government decides proper process in this house no longer matters\u201d they can\u2019t come to the opposition seeking cooperation on other procedural matters. Craig Kelly has just been advertised as a speaker at the American Conservative Union conference being held in Sydney next month. Nigel Farage is the headline act, because of course he is. Mark Latham is also speaking. As is Tony Abbott. And now \u2013 backbencher Craig Kelly. Try not to hurt yourself in your rush for tickets. The American Conservative Union and LibertyWorks are proud to bring CPAC to Australia for the first time! CPAC will launch and run over 9-11 August 2019 and the timing couldn\u2019t be better. This is a conference for those that despaired at the prospect of a Shorten government controlled by militant unions and influenced by the Greens. Australia dodged a socialist arrow this time, and thank goodness for that, but we know they will redouble their efforts and come again supported by their boosters the Unions and GetUp. Now is not the time to be complacent. Now is the time to get involved. The \u2018shy\u2019 voters made a stand this time however we should remind ourselves that \u2018The future doesn\u2019t belong to the light-hearted. It belongs to the brave\u2019, as Ronald Reagan famously stated. Come to CPAC, hear Nigel Farage, Matt Sclapp, conservative senators and MPs, visiting US congressmen, Australia\u2019s political warriors and more \u2026 much more. Come to CPAC, join the brave, protect the future.\u201d The inquiry into Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs and their compliance with ministerial standards has to report back by 10 September, which is midway through the next sitting week. (a) Compliance by former ministers of state with the requirements of paragraph 2.25 of the prime minister\u2019s statement of ministerial standards, dated 30 August 2018, including, but not limited to the undertakings given by ministers to comply with their obligations concerning post-ministerial employment, and action taken by the prime minister and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to ensure full compliance by former ministers with paragraph 2.25 of the ministerial standards. That exchange makes Russell Broadbent\u2019s call to end indefinite detention even more interesting. Larissa Waters followed it up with this: What was particularly galling today was that my colleague, senator Nick McKim, who was just booted out of the country for politely trying to look at what is happening in these detention centres, asked the government: are you going to give the head of PNG the answer about the timetable? What is the timetable for withdrawal, is there one? And the government refused to accept there are even people still in detention, even though behind razor wire every night those facilities are locked and people are behind those locked doors, so it was a case of a parallel universe. I think we are potentially further damaging our relationship here with PNG if we continue to refuse to answer those very valid questions that are being levelled at us and the government just squibbed it today. They do not accept there is a problem. Much like the ministerial standards, they want to say nothing to see here and go back to going out to lunch with the latest lobbyist.\u201d Now, on the issue of detention on Manus Island, you may remember this exchange at the press conference with James Marape and Scott Morrison this morning: Question: Thank you. Prime minister, you\u2019ve spoken about Australia\u2019s step-up, but there are some growing calls for Australia to step down from offshore detention. Prime minister Marape, would you like to see the Manus Island detention centre closed? And prime minister Morrison, are you prepared to do that if that\u2019s what the prime minister asks of Australia? Morrison: Let me start off by saying that the detention centre on Manus Island is closed, has been closed for some time. There is no detention centre on Manus Island. I think it\u2019s important that Australians are no longer told that somehow there is a detention centre that\u2019s operating on Manus Island. That has been a process we\u2019ve been working through now for some time. The accommodation facility at East Lorengau which now accommodates, there are about 300-odd people on Manus Island currently who are refugees and that is down from 1,353 at the peak when Labor were in power. So we\u2019ve made substantial progress. The detention centre at Lombrum is closed and we\u2019re working very closely together with the PNG government in terms of the service arrangements which continue for those who continue to be resident on Manus Island. And that includes a tender process on the contract which has had a lot of attention on it here, which we mutually agreed would be put in place and the existing contract extended until that tender process had been completed to allow a new service provider to step up. Prime minister? Marape: Yes, as confirmed by prime minister Morrison, there is no more detention. People are living freely in Manus, and also some have moved to Port Moresby for medical reasons and are moving around freely. And I\u2019ve expressed clearly to minister Dutton that we need to establish a schedule and timetable towards full closure of the entire asylum processes. PNG has always stood in, and stepped in to assist Australia in times of need, as you have always done to us also. We will ensure that we have a mutually workable timetable and closer program that is healthy for all of us, but more importantly, healthy for those people who have been part of us in Manus and now in PNG for some time now. Some are classified as refugees. Those who are classified as refugees, the international convention on refugees and resettlement will apply. Some are not classified as refugees; we\u2019ll work with them to ensure they resettle, given encouragement to move back to their home of origin or where they\u2019d like to move. Those are works in process that both governments have agreed to establish a schedule going forward. And for us, to find some closure in the Manus asylum seekers. But let me agree with prime minister Morrison: there is no more detention. We\u2019re in the process of resettling the entire people out from PNG, within PNG, and common decency will apply to those human beings who are with us in Port Moresby and Manus right now. Larissa Waters is next up on Afternoon Briefing. She said this about why the inquiry into Pyne and Bishop\u2019s jobs is so important: This is an area where people are really crying out for better representation. If you don\u2019t have integrity in politics, then people lose confidence in the system, they turn off, and I think that is why we see so many Australians think that politics does not speak for them. Because you look at this place and people are feathering their own nest and then going off in this cosy relationship with industry groups. Like a revolving door between parliament and lobby groups and industry groups. We have got to fix that. We in here have a job to represent the people and to try to work for the best outcomes of the citizens and our planet and you cannot do that if you are on the take or lining yourself up a job when you finish.\u201d On Newstart, Russell Broadbent had this to say: It is up to the government to govern with the resources they have and we have to give everybody as much as possible. I have to question the Jobstart agencies as to their effectiveness and would money be better spent directly with those who are unemployed, enabling them to get job opportunities.\u201d The first speeches are well under way. Anika Wells is wearing white in solidarity with the suffragettes. Her daughter Celeste has been with her for much of the day. Julian Simmonds became emotional as he spoke of those who had supported him. So despite Mathias Cormann appearing to rule out delaying superannuation increases, Scott Morrison twice knocked back chances in question time to do the same. Then senator James Paterson said this in the Senate after question time: \u201cOf course it\u2019s entirely appropriate the government has commissioned a retirement incomes review as a recommendation of the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission recognised it\u2019s no good putting more money into superannuation if that system is broken, as we believe it currently is.\u201d Paterson cited work by the assistant minister for superannuation, Jane Hume, to prevent fees and inappropriate insurance eating up low balances. He name checked both the treasury under Ken Henry during Labor\u2019s time in government and the Grattan Institute as independent bodies which opposed super increases. So despite what Cormann told the Senate, it sounds like the Liberal MPs who arced up calling for super increases to be frozen have not given up. On indefinite detention, and the New Zealand offer to take 150 refugees from Manus Island and Nauru, Russell Broadbent says: \u201cWe can\u2019t continue with indefinite detention. We cannot. That is the bottom line. At the same time we cannot have the Greens option of open borders. \u201cThat is not on either. The prime minister is going through protecting his border from this type of immigration and at the same time trying to have a compassionate stance on the people in long-term detention who will not be here, many of which are not refugees, Patricia, they are not refugees so New Zealand is only gonna take those people who are established as refugees ... \u201cI think I would like to see the government pursue issues that would go towards, anything, that would go towards there being nobody left on Manus Island and nobody left on Nauru indefinite detention. \u201cThat is what they want to do and that is at the heart for the nation. Clearly. Many in my community and across Australia thought we had dealt with indefinite detention under the Howard government. \u201cThat should be a call-out to those people that care about this issue to make sure that contacting the local members and their prime minister and the minister to say this is how we feel. \u201cThat this has not gone away for us and that should be a strong movement by a whole lot of people. I believe Mr Dutton is trying to find a solution.\u201d Patricia Karvelas asks if he believes advocacy around ending indefinite detention had lost momentum. It rises and falls like the tide. It often takes a catalyst of an individual issue to be raised around indefinite detention. I just find it personally unacceptable for the nation that we are, for the free and wonderful nation that we are, Patricia, and we have to take every opportunity that is there to remove these people from indefinite detention.\u201d Russell Broadbent is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on Afternoon Briefing. He had this to say about Julie Bishop and Christopher Pyne\u2019s new job: I think the Senate inquiry will be more of a political exercise. That is not my concern. My concern is that members of that era, of Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop, were very well looked after by the old parliamentary superannuation scheme so I think they should have particular regard and respect for any decisions that they take soon after leaving politics in regard to the parliament and former members and to those members who have to carry on into the processes of governing ... I think we need to defend that trust because in the past we have let the public down too often as individuals and then probably when governments have said one thing and done another, on both sides of the House. It is not a broad accusation, it is just the way the public see us. I am very close to my community and have been for a long time and know what they feel. At the football club they could not care less what Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop are doing at the moment, they are worried about the kids and their hopes and aspirations for the future and just having a job. These are things that are important to them but just the same, in general they do not like the look [of taking these jobs].\u201d But he trusts that Bishop and Pyne will do the right thing and trusts in Martin Parkinson\u2019s report. He does not believe there needs to be stricter standards for former ministers. And the motion itself: The Senate will hold an inquiry into Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop\u2019s new roles. The vote was won 35 to 29. That\u2019s Labor, the Greens and the whole crossbench voting for Rex Patrick\u2019s motion. The Senate is voting on Rex Patrick\u2019s motion to start an inquiry into Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop\u2019s new job. It has the numbers. This from the Greens (as reported by Katharine Murphy): The Greens also want to pursue an amendment to the terms of reference to include whether serving ministers Angus Taylor and Josh Frydenberg may have breached guidelines regarding the listing and alleged destruction of a critically endangered grassland species.\u201d Was rejected. As that paperwork was going on, Tony Burke was meant to give leave for something (I think) and there was some interruption. \u201cDo you want me to just not give leave next time?\u201d Burke asked. Scott Morrison, who was still in his chair, said something about Burke sounding \u201cvery threatened\u201d. \u201cGrow up, seriously,\u201d Morrison said across the table. So. Civil. Scott Morrison calls an end to question time. Morrison tries to introduce the member for Ryan\u2019s (Julian Simmonds) first speech, but Tony Burke reminds the chamber there is paperwork first. Bit of a downer. Simmonds, you may remember, took the preselection from the previous member, Jane Prentice. He had been her campaign manager. Prentice was not planning on stepping down, but lost the vote in her branch. It is back to dixers. The motion to move to suspend standing orders is defeated 65 to 75. We return to question time. It looks like Palladium has taken down that video Tony Burke was talking about. I can\u2019t find it on their Facebook page. I never thought I would say this, but I miss the bells. And that is coming from someone who hears them in her dreams. That motion is also won by the ayes: 76 to 69. Terri Butler jumps up to say \u201cThe more you look at this, the dodgier it gets\u201d and is told to sit down. And we are now voting on no longer hearing from her. So we will sit in awkward silence for another few minutes before coming to the inevitable conclusion of: 76 to 69. The motion to no longer hear from Tony Burke is won: 76 to 69. Mark Butler jumps up to try and suspend standing orders again (the next step) and the government moves to no longer hear him as well. We go back to the AyePads. I\u2019ve just been informed that the iPads used for the digital divisions have already been christened \u201cAyePads\u201d. Digital divisions mean we all just sit here in an awkward \u201cend of exam\u201d silence. And the motion: For those who missed it, we do divisions via iPads now: Meanwhile, an older gentleman stood up in the gallery and looked prepared to yell something out but was asked to sit down. He tried to hand a report to the floor and seemed to say something about the \u201cminister for trees ... you\u2019ve cleared too many\u201d. \u201cThe drought is man-made,\u201d he said. \u201cProve me wrong.\u201d Following Tony Burke\u2019s question about Julie Bishop and the video she filmed, Burke attempts to suspend standing orders. Christian Porter asks that he no longer be heard. We will now have about 10 minutes of divisions that go nowhere. Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister tell the House how the claim that Julie Bishop had nothing to do with Palladium in the five years she was minister is consistent with her appearance in a video filmed in her office titled \u201cAustralian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop commends Palladium business part of platform\u201d which was posted to the Palladium \u201cmake it possible\u201d site? Morrison: I refer them into the report provided by the secretary. Someone has been reading the blog Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: (I miss the whole question, but it is on whether or not he is confident there was full disclosure in the Pyne/Bishop review) Morrison: I am pleased to table the reply provided that goes into the matter. I have no reason to doubt at all the competence of the secretary of the Department in relation to these matters whatsoever. My simple question is, why does the Labor Party seemed to question the competency of the secretary, the transparency of the arrangements that he has entered into are there for him to see. All I can see is just another attempt by the Labor Party to get into what the former Manager of Government Business [Pyne] used to call the chum bucket. Karen Andrews just made the most Karen joke of all time. (Google a Karen if you don\u2019t know what I am talking about.) This is how Tveeder transcribed it. Space has long been called the final frontier but, under the Morrison government, space is the new jobs frontier.\u201d GROANS. Tveeder does not lie. Rowan Ramsey asks the next dixer about the moon landing, which he says he is embarrassed to say he remembers well. Ed Husic asks him to tell him about meeting the Wright Brothers or Louis Pasteur. AB Culvahouse is no longer in the House. Lucky him. There you go Tony Burke to Scott Morrison: Does the prime minister stand by the outcome of the inquiry into the compliance of former ministers, Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop? Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for his question. I have accepted the advice of the secretary and that response that was provided by the secretary has been tabled in the Senate.\u201d Alan Tudge is doing his best Alan Tudge. \u201cBring back Pyne, at least he was fun,\u201d yells someone from Labor. Bill Shorten is still overseas, for those wondering. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. This morning his trade minister said about the legislated increase to the superannuation guarantee [that] it is not the government\u2019s intention to change what is legislated at this point in time. Will the prime minister rule out any changes to the legislated increase in the superannuation guarantee? Morrison: I simply say to the member what I just said. There is no change to the government\u2019s policy. But on the topic of superannuation, given we are talking about the positions of parties on superannuation, does the Labor party stand by its more than $30bn in higher superannuation taxes, Mr Speaker? Are they going to walk away from that or are they going to continue to see superannuation as a target for their higher taxing policies? Because Mr Speaker, the Labor party have learned nothing since the last election. They oppose tax relief. The leader of the opposition opposed tax relief in this parliament, speaking against it inside this chamber and out. They are opposing us seeking to support farmers and graziers and the rural community in this country by legislating the drought fund, yet we continue to invest in infrastructure at record levels, $25bn. More than six times the amount that the building Australia fund actually had, we spent more than six times that amount in committed funding. The leader of the opposition is opposition with a capital O.\u201d Labor voted for the tax package. David Littleproud continues his \u201cwatch me not yell\u201d question time experiment in his dixer. He also includes the government\u2019s talking point line of the day: So the question comes: do those opposite who politicise the misery of Australian farmers in one of their lowest acts in this nation\u2019s parliament by voting against the future drought fund bill back in October? Who do they support? Do they support Australian farming families or do they support the continuation of cheap politics?\u201d Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: My question as to the prime minister. Does he agree with seven of his backbenchers who want to see the legislated increase of the superannuation guarantee to 12%? Morrison: There is no change to the government public policy. Michael McCormack ended with: Farmers there made it very clear to us they want dams, they want pipelines, they ... want what infrastructure, they want to heighten, lengthen and strengthen weirs. We are getting on with doing just that. We put half $1bn into the national infrastructure development fund last year. Those opposite are not interested in regional Australia or that infrastructure and it shows every day of the week.\u201d Someone from Labor yells out \u201cNo dams in six years.\u201d \u201cWatch this space,\u201d McCormack says as he sits down. Oh the lols. Phil Thompson gets the next dixer and the new Herbert MP brings Michael McCormack back to the despatch box which is just too much McCormack for any one. But everyone, including those on the Coalition side, get the opportunity to check their phones and reports, so it is not a total loss. Andrew Wilkie gets his first question as the member for Clark (the electorate was previously called Denison): I discussed with you recently ... that since 2014 the Tasmanian government has failed to spend on health some $1.6bn of GST funding earmarked for health. This is obviously no small matter in light of the systemic public health crisis being experienced in Tasmania. Nor is it disputed as a recent IAP fact-checker confirmed the Tasmanian government has indeed misspent $1.6bn of the federal health fund. Will you hold the Tasmanian government to account for this deadly dereliction of its core responsibility to provide effective health services, and what safeguards will you put in place to prevent this misconduct in the future?\u201d Greg Hunt: (After a preamble): the answer to that question respectfully is that the overall Tasmanian funding, which is informed by these variety of sources which go into it, has increased quite dramatically from 25% to 32%. That means Tasmania\u2019s public funding is not only up in action dollars but also proportionate dollars.\u201d David Littleproud: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and, well, well, well, we have seen him crawl out of the rock he has been hiding [under] after six years. He was not going to ask me a question about a drought or anything else because we had made a commitment to those impacted by the drought not to politicise the misery of Australian farmers is nothing short of the lowest political act that I have seen in the last parliament. We put in place a systematic way to address it, to listen to communities, not only with the drought envoy but with making sure that we sat around kitchen tables, in sheds, listening to farmers and communities because it is not just farmers but also the communities that support them and that is why we are putting in place $1.9bn in supporting the here and now but a future fund that you voted against, those opposite voted against before the last election to politicise the misery of Australian farmers by trying to score a cheap political point. People in this country want leadership, they do not want politics. You\u2019re playing with the lives of Australian farming families. This is above politics. This is something that we can do better as a parliament, get behind this today. A $5bn future fund that goes on to support Australian farming families, not just in the here and now, they can be taken away at the whim of a treasurer, but legislated and protect to make sure we make that commitment for longevity.\u201d Tony Smith is having none of it, pointing out that the question was succinct and Littleproud has just gone on and on without actually addressing the question. He tells him to get on with it. Littleproud: Happy to. As articulated earlier, we have gone to the point of consultations and now it is time to get on to the job. We elevated drought to cabinet for the first time. We had a prime minister who in the first couple of days of his prime ministership came to a drought-affected community and has elevated drought to the highest table of his office. That is leadership, not politics\u201d tl;dr \u2013 we don\u2019t need Barnaby any more. The Senate is just dishing it up today: Joel Fitzgibbon to David Littleproud: My question is to the minister for drought and I ask him, why is it that the government no longer has a drought envoy? Barnaby Joyce raised his hands in the air, in the international \u201cI don\u2019t know either\u201d signal. Michael McCormack said some more things, including bungling the government talking point line of the day \u201cwhich side is Labor on\u201d. We are getting on with the job of putting our economic management into surplus. It is something they could only have a pipe dream and we talk of pipe dreams, pipelines, we have a pipeline of assessment. $100m over the next 10 years. We are getting on with the job. It is creating jobs. What side do they sit on? Do they want to get on with getting their constituents home safer and sooner? Or do they want to continue to object and oppose everything?\u201d We know what side Labor sits on. It\u2019s the opposition. The defence minister, Linda Reynolds, is taking questions from Labor in Senate question time about when and how refugees will be taken off Manus Island. Reynolds said the meeting with the Papua New Guinean prime minister, James Marape, his ministers and the governor of Manus were \u201cvery productive\u201d and included discussion of developing the base on Manus Island to provide employment opportunities for people on Manus. Reynolds confirms the governments also discussed the possibility of resettlement packages to allow refugees to resettle (elsewhere) in PNG. She dodged Labor\u2019s Kristina Keneally\u2019s query about when all refugees will be off Manus, falling back on Coalition lines that there is \u201cnobody in detention\u201d there and it is all Labor\u2019s fault anyway. Catherine King inflicts Michael McCormack on us. What is the point of Independent Infrastructure Australia making recommendations to government on transport, water, energy and communication priorities if there is no money in the building Australia fund to fund its recommendations? McCormack: Well, I thank the shadow minister for her question and note the presence in the chamber of the American ambassador, one small step for man, yesterday was one giant leap forward for Parkes which will play an integral part in the inland rail $9.3m investment because we get on and do things. The inland rail was first suggested in 1890, the first plant drawn up into the early 1900s and the Liberals and Nationals are building it. More to the point of the shadow minister\u2019s question, 19 out of 21 projects on the priority list are funded by the Australian government. Nineteen out of 21. That is not a bad result. This government significantly transformed the way we invest in infrastructure. A $100bn commitment investment in infrastructure right across the country. Better roads, better rail, better airports, better seedpods. We are getting on with the job of building infrastructure to get Australians home sooner and safer.\u201d I think I am actually stupider for having listened to that. I can feel brain cells running out of my ear and down my neck in a desperate bid to escape. Melissa McIntosh, the new Liberal MP for Lindsay, gets the first dixer. And maybe outs herself as the MP who missed the cue to stand up, allowing Joel Fitzgibbon to sneak in his question early. Ahhhh, isn\u2019t this parliament just so much more civil than the last? Glad both Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese made that clear. First Scott Morrison answers with a preamble: It is a fund that the Labor party is opposing. They opposed it in the last parliament, we put it in the budget, we took it to the Australian people, the Australian people returned the government to ensure that we can get on with the job of supporting our farmers through one of the toughest droughts that this country has ever seen. This government has delivered some $7bn worth of support to our farmers and our rural communities all around the country. Most recently, that has included more than $110m, Mr Speaker.\u201d Fitzgibbon gets up with an \u201canswer the question\u201d point of order, to which Tony Smith says the prime minister is allowed to have a preamble. Morrison: \u201cThe point I make is the government has been acting each and every day supporting rural communities on the issue of the drought, whether it is the immediate assistance required to support communities through the million dollar payments to each of the shires and councils around the country or to invest in the water infrastructure projects which build resilience. \u201cWe are investing in those projects right now and the future drought fund will enable us to continue to invest in those drought-resilience projects into the future. We are funding those drought-resilience projects about now out of the budget, and from 1 July next year we will draw down $100m out of the fund that will increase in value to $5bn and provide permanent funding support for drought-resilience projects in this country. \u201cI have a simple statement to make to those opposite. Why won\u2019t you support farmers going through the drought? Mr Speaker, how on earth can the leader of the opposition, and I will call him the leader of the opposition because I\u2019ve yet to find something that he doesn\u2019t oppose. Mr Speaker, he opposed us on tax relief for Australians, he opposed us on security measures and now they oppose us on the drought fund.\u201d Two things: Bill Shorten is not in the chamber, and whoever was meant to jump up for the dixer did not, and we go straight to Joel Fitzgibbon: My question is also to the prime minister: why is it the proposed draft fund will not deliver a cent until at least next July? Anthony Albanese gives his respect to those who went to the moon and we begin. Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister, and it goes to national security. Does the prime minister doubt which side people are on when they support the unanimous position of the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security? Morrison: I thank the member for his question and raising the role of the joint standing committee. The joint standing committee on these matters does important work in this parliament, and when members come to that committee, they bring forward the positions of their various parties to address the national security issues the country faces. And what I have noted in my time in this place is that it has always been those who sit on this side of the house have always brought the stronger position. It is always those I sit with on this side of the house ... (Labor goes insane at this) \u201c ... With the measures before that committee that the matters have been sought to be watered down. And therefore it is always going to be the action of my government to ensure that where those matters are watered down, we will always seek to remedy it and always keep Australia strong.\u201d Before QT, Scott Morrison stands to recognise the 50th anniversary of the moon landing. That\u2019s why AB Culvahouse is in the House. Scott Morrison has entered the chamber and is greeting Arthur B Culvahouse, the US ambassador, who is a guest of the House today. Suggestions on the new pub test are coming in strong It is time for Who\u2019s That MP ... and it\u2019s Ken O\u2019Dowd. Just in case you missed it \u2013 because I did \u2013 James Ashby is back in the parliament. Ashby had his pass taken from him after an altercation with Brian Burston last year. He\u2019s now had it reinstated. I am off to the chamber for question time. Hit me up with your bingo predictions. Meanwhile, I really do think we need to update the pub test to something more in line where actual opinions are given. Like, the group chat test. Every single pub test in Australia has been failed today. Every. Single. One. Ain\u2019t politics grand. Much of Queensland has been in drought for close to a decade but it only really hit the national agenda when it was creeping in on the regions around Sydney. Strange that. The speeches taking note of the review conclude. The vote on an inquiry will be held after question time. Malcolm Roberts just linked Julie Bishop to Hillary [Clinton] \u201cand the images that go with that\u201d. You just know that \u201clock her up\u201d was chanting in his head. He also says the jobs Christopher Pyne and Bishop have taken are an \u201cinsult\u201d to the Australian people. I can think of a couple of other insults to the Australian people, but moving on ... The Australian National Audit Office has issued a report into the defence department\u2019s handling of travel expenses and concluded its processes are \u201cnot fully effective\u201d and it has \u201coverstated\u201d progress on initiatives to improve administration. From the report: \u201cDefence\u2019s administrative arrangements to support the payment of travel allowances to APS employees exhibit shortcomings, which reduce their appropriateness. These include: inconsistency in guidance; a failure to consistently reflect policy requirements in guidance and supporting tools (such as travel calculators); and the division of policy and administrative responsibility across three defence groups. The 2015 review of red tape in defence made similar findings and recommended that defence produce a \u2018single, brief policy guidance document in plain English\u2019 on official travel and the use of the defence travel card. Defence reported internally that it had addressed this recommendation, when it had not ... \u201cDefence\u2019s arrangements for providing assurance over the payment of travel allowances to APS employees are not fully effective. Defence has identified shortcomings in the design of detective controls for credit cards and ANAO testing of a sample of travel allowance transactions indicates that preventative controls are not fully effective. This performance audit identified a number of instances where defence reports to senior committees overstated the progress of activities intended to improve assurance across the administration of travel and credit cards. These instances included: incorrect advice about residual risk; and advice that recommendations from reviews and audits had been addressed, when they had not. \u201cA key feature of this audit has been that defence\u2019s senior committees have been provided with advice that overstates the progress of activities intended to improve the administration of travel allowances and credit cards. Inaccurate performance reporting reduces accountability and senior leaders\u2019 ability to assess risks and consider the need for remediation strategies.\u201d Looks like One Nation is also on board for an inquiry. It also looks like Malcolm Roberts has taken public speaking lessons straight from Toastmasters 101. There are many hand movements. That is how you know he is serious. Everything that is happening in the Senate at the moment is just the formal response to the tabling of Martin Parkinson\u2019s report into Christopher Pyne\u2019s and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs. The actual vote on whether or not there should be an inquiry won\u2019t happen until later this afternoon, about 4pm. The Greens have held a press conference calling on the government to lift Newstart by $75 a week and criticising Labor for proposing only a review. Richard Di Natale compared the trajectory of the issue to the banking royal commission debate when the Greens were the first mover then \u201ceventually ... got the Labor party across the line, we got the crossbenchers across the line and then we started to see National party MPs speak out\u201d. The Greens leader said: \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that right now Barnaby Joyce has raised his voice saying he thinks it needs to go up. We\u2019re seeing backbench members within the Labor party saying it needs to go up. I feel we\u2019re at a point that we\u2019re going to start to see the pressure building on the government, so that an increase in Newstart becomes inevitable.\u201d The Greens\u2019 social services spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, accused the government of \u201cuntruths\u201d that Newstart is a transition payment, citing the fact that 44% of people receive the unemployment payment for longer than two years, and 15% longer than five years. Despite Liberal Dean Smith joining the ranks of those calling for an increase, Siewert criticised him for failing to vote for the Greens\u2019 bill. She also chipped Labor for suggesting the Greens were wasting time in the Senate. Larissa Waters says the Greens will support the inquiry into former ministers moving into jobs related to their portfolios \u2013 but they want actual solutions. She\u2019s also asking what happened to Christian Porter\u2019s federal Icac, which she says has not been spoken of since February. That would be the behind-the-scenes Icac, where you would find out there was an investigation only if there was a guilty verdict in the court afterwards. Kristina Keneally finished her speech to the Senate by saying Scott Morrison faced an integrity test, with his response to Christopher Pyne\u2019s and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs. Rex Patrick is up now and is basically saying the outcome of the review is \u201cridiculous\u201d given the information both former ministers have, and how that can be used in their new roles. He says the parliament needs to have more of a look at how their knowledge will be used. Which means \u2013 there will be an inquiry. It\u2019s only a year late, but the government will table the ombudsman\u2019s report into the Telecommunications (interception and access) Act 1979 \u2013 you know, the bill that allows the government to keep all of your metadata \u2013 later this afternoon. It\u2019s the report for 2016-17. We are in 2018-19. But why on earth should we need to know how often security agencies are accessing our data? Over in the Senate, Kristina Keneally says the results of the Martin Parkinson review into Christopher Pyne\u2019s and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs is \u201cabsurd\u201d. She says she will not be surprised if Scott Morrison tries to dismiss it as something \u201cin the Canberra bubble\u201d but says this involves hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts. Oh, and Manus Island is still Labor\u2019s fault. Scott Morrison: We\u2019re dealing with the problem of people who found themselves on Manus Island because of the failed border protection policies of the previous government. That\u2019s who is on Manus Island. That\u2019s who is there. So we\u2019re still dealing with the legacy of the policy failures of the previous government.\u201d Six. Years. Later. Scott Morrison ends the press conference by saying that he and James Marape will be watching the Cronulla Sharks at the end of the week. \u201cI believe in miracles,\u201d he says (to which my brain answers \u2018do ya, do ya, do ya\u2019 . EVERY TIME). \u201cSo hoping for one on Thursday when we go up against the Cowboys.\u201d Acoss have also put together a fact sheet on Newstart. You can find it here The Australian Council of Social Service has very much welcomed Dean Smith\u2019s call to raise the Newstart rate. From its statement: Australian Council of Social Service\u2019s acting chief executive, Jacqui Phillips, said: \u201cCommunity members and journalists are rightly asking members of the government whether they could live on $40 a day. \u201cThe government cannot continue to avoid the question by spreading misconceptions. \u201cPeople on Newstart are actively looking for paid work \u2013 they apply for 20 jobs a month \u2013 but the reality is there is only one job available for every eight people looking for a job or more hours. \u201cWhile some in the government claim most people on Newstart receive other payments, they neglect to explain that this is due to the energy supplement, which is less than $1 a day. \u201cLess than half of people on Newstart receive rent assistance, which is about $10 a day, if you spend at least $150 a week on housing. Less than 20% of people on Newstart receive a family tax benefit, which goes to helping cover the cost of raising children. \u201cWhen we look at who is on Newstart, we see that half of recipients are over the age of 45; more than 100,000 are single parents; and one in four have an illness or disability but cannot get the disability support pension. \u201cOlder people, people with disability and single parents face challenges and discrimination in finding paid work and this is part of the reason why the average time spent on Newstart is three years. \u201cThe reality for people on Newstart is that they are living in deep financial crisis that severely restricts their chance of finding paid work. It is very hard to put your best foot forward in a job interview when you\u2019re eating one meal a day, wearing worn-through clothing, and are worrying about how to pay rent.\u201d On Manus Island: Scott Morrison: \u201cThe detention centre on Manus Island is closed, has been closed for some time. There is no detention centre on Manus Island. I think it\u2019s important that Australians are no longer told that somehow there is a detention centre that\u2019s operating on Manus Island. \u201cThat is a process we\u2019ve been working through for some time. The accommodation facility which now accommodates about 300 people on Manus Island currently, and that is down from 1,353, at the peak when Labor were in power. \u201cSo the detention centre ... is closed and we\u2019re working closely with the PNG government ... [over] the service arrangements for those who continue to be resident on Manus Island, and that includes a tender process for someone who had a lot of attention on it here, which we mutually agreed would be put in place and the existing contract extended until the tender process was there until a new service stepped up. Prime minister?\u201d James Marape: \u201cYes, as confirmed by prime minister Morrison, there is no more detention. People are living freely in Manus, and also some have moved to Port Moresby for medical, and moving around freely. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve expressed clearly to minister Dutton that we need to establish a schedule and timetable towards full closure of the entire asylum processes. As PNG has always stood in to assist Australia in times of need, as it has done for us also, we will ensure that we have a mutually workable timetable and closer program that is healthy for all of us, but more importantly, healthy for those people who have been part of us in Manus and PNG. Some are classified as refugees. \u201cThose classified as final refugee, the international convention of refugees will apply. Those who aren\u2019t classified as refugees, we\u2019ll see where they\u2019re given encouragement to move back to their home of origin or where they\u2019d like to move. \u201cThose are works in process that both governments have agreed to. And for us, to find some closure in the Manus area. But let me agree with prime minister Morrison, there is no more detention. We\u2019re in the process of resettling the entire people out from PNG, within PNG, and common decency will apply to the people who are with us in Port Moresby and Manus now.\u201d James Marape: We come to Australia as friend and family, as prime minister Scott Morrison has indicated. [The] meeting this morning was to consolidate on some of the issues that we need to build on as leader to leader, that will set the pace for our ministers to have their dialogue, and we will consolidate going into the future. The future for PNG is not a future of economy and security. PNG must be economically secure. Once PNG is economically secure, we secure borders and we in turn become very, very healthy and fruitful. I believe the Pacific island region is one of the best places if not the best place globally speaking. We need to keep the peace and serenity and the environment just as we have, something that is a global asset.\u201d I almost missed this: That gets the inquiry over the line. Scott Morrison and James Marape are holding their joint press conference. Morrison opens with this: It\u2019s been a great privilege that prime minister Marape has been my first guest of government status visitor to Australia, and I\u2019m also incredibly pleased that it is Papua New Guinea who holds that status as the first country to visit, particularly post the election in this formal status.\u201d Which means that Jacinda Ardern, who was here last week, did not hold that status. The gist of the statement is Australia and PNG are cool friends, and share a passion for rugby league and a connection through church programs (both of which were mentioned). Also, looking at that photo, I am sorry, but beards are cancelled now. I don\u2019t make the rules. What is this? A party for ants? It needs to be at least three times bigger than this! Alternatively, so many womens! (Compared to when they just had two.) It was a four flagger. There are also a butt load of first speeches being delivered today. Among them are newbies Anika Wells, Josh Burns and Julian Simmonds, all of whom have very young children who will be in the gallery to watch their parents. I will be watching the three children under two attempting to sit still in the weird place that is parliament. Over in the Senate, the Liberal Dean Smith has joined a growing group of government MPs who say Newstart should be increased. Smith made the comments during a debate on a bill by the Greens senator Rachel Siewert, which sought to increase the unemployment payment by $75 a week, in line with calls from Acoss, and some business groups. \u201cI am someone who thinks that the Newstart allowance amount must be more than reviewed \u2013 which was Labor\u2019s position \u2013 [but] should be increased,\u201d Smith said. He cited comments from John Howard, who called last year for the payment to be increased, as well as the RBA governor Philip Lowe\u2019s recent remarks about the need for a boost to wages. Smith joins Coalition politicians Barnaby Joyce, Arthur Sinodinos and Matthew Canavan. Siewert began by lashing the government for being \u201cwilfully ignorant or misleading our nation\u201d in its claims that Newstart recipients move off the payment quickly. In fact, the average duration is three years. \u201cHow are people expected to look for work when they are living below the poverty line,\u201d she said. Labor\u2019s Pat Dodson, who said the payment needed to increase, also criticised the government\u2019s \u201cdisingenuous\u201d claims about the welfare payment. It has also claimed that the payment increases every six months, and that 99% of recipients get other payments. Dodson suggested that because only the government could increase Newstart, Siewert\u2019s bill meant the Senate had \u201cwasted a bit of time here this morning\u201d. Debate on the bill was adjourned. The Greens leader Richard Di Natale will hold a press conference in the Senate courtyard at 12.30. That will be on Newstart, security bills and the Murray-Darling. Oh and for those wondering if the budget could handle the $3bn or so annual cost to increase Newstart, franking credits cost about $6bn a year. So yeah. It probably could. Even with the SuRpLuS obsession. There you go there\u2019s one more. On the numbers (and remember numbers aren\u2019t my thing) by my count Labor, the Greens and Centre Alliance are still two short of getting the inquiry through. Cory Bernardi had flirted with the idea of voting for the inquiry. Jacqui Lambie didn\u2019t say, but has been very vocal about lobbyists in the past. One Nation \u2013 who knows (timeless statement) but don\u2019t be surprised if Pauline Hanson voted yes, as part of her \u201cholding them to account\u201d schtick. Oh, and on Hanson, the Australian\u2019s media section reported today that she has been booked for a once a fortnight paid appearance on Network Nine\u2019s Today show. Cool. Katharine Murphy has had a chat to Labor about Rex Patrick\u2019s move to bring former ministers\u2019 lobbying jobs to a Senate inquiry and says the guidance, at this stage, is that Labor is likely to support it. Mathias Cormann will make a statement to the Senate at 12.20 about the outcome of Martin Parkinson\u2019s review into Christopher Pyne\u2019s and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs, but it might not be enough. Rex Patrick is still pushing for an inquiry: On what is before me at present I will still be asking the Senate to conduct an inquiry.\u201d Scott Morrison and Papua New Guinea\u2019s PM, James Marape, will make a joint statement at 11.30 in the prime minister\u2019s courtyard. Just on the medevac legislation, the repeal bill has been sent to a parliamentary committee for a review. Submissions close mid next month and the report date is not until 18 October. The next sitting (from 21 October) is a House sitting only. The Senate won\u2019t sit until 11 November. The too-long, didn\u2019t-read version of that is that he had conversations with both of them and is satisfied, on the information given, that both Pyne and Bishop know their responsibilities. Here is Martin Parkinson\u2019s report on the review into Christopher Pyne\u2019s and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs: Speaking of national security \u2013 and the bipartisan approach the political parties have taken on it (in that they both back the legislation as a general rule) \u2013 Labor is a bit cranky over Mathias Cormann saying this on AM this morning: \u201cThe Labor party needs to decide which side they\u2019re on \u2026 We are on the side of keeping Australians safe.\u201d That will not be the end of it. This has been happening with increasing regularity. The government accuses Labor of not supporting it on national security. Every single time someone asks a question about the bill Labor points out it has always backed the national security legislation. There is argy bargy and then everyone votes for the legislation. Rinse and repeat. But given the way national security debates tend to go in this country, Labor will most likely end up supporting the bill. Kristina Keneally has released a statement on the temporary exclusion order legislation, asking why the legislation is suddenly so \u201curgent\u201d given how long Peter Dutton has been in the job: Home affairs minister Peter Dutton must explain why he has waited four years to introduce a temporary exclusion order (TEO) scheme in Australia. \u201cWe are working through national security legislation as quickly as possible.\u201d Mathias Cormann, ABC AM, 22 July 2019 The United Kingdom TEO scheme \u2013 which Mr Dutton so frequently cites \u2013 was introduced in 2015. However, Mr Dutton didn\u2019t introduce similar legislation in Australia until February 2019. Would Mr Dutton be willing to say he was working \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d when it took him four years to introduce TEO legislation? During the four years Mr Dutton waited to introduce the TEO legislation, it\u2019s reported 40 foreign fighters have returned to Australia. These 40 foreign fighters have only been able to return because the home affairs minister failed to introduce legislation for four years. Was it incompetence or apathy towards the risks of foreign fighters by minister Dutton that saw him do nothing during this time? Labor has already expressed its support for the intent of the TEO scheme, and agreed with the Liberal-dominated PJCIS that its recommended changes be incorporated into the legislation. Labor wants a TEO scheme that works, is constitutional, keeps Australians safe and that withstands high court challenges.\u201d Pauline Hanson also wants Newstart raised: There\u2019s a talk about $75 a week that needs to be raised. I think that needs to be addressed and it also needs to be costed. Can we afford it? That\u2019s another thing too.\u201d Andrew Leigh responded to Mathias Cormann: It\u2019s important to recognise that many Australians are living on Newstart for ongoing periods. I heard Mathias Cormann this morning saying it\u2019s a temporary payment. He might speak to some of 150,000 Australians who\u2019ve been living on Newstart for more than a year, to the 80,000 Australians who have been living on Newstart for more than two years. It\u2019s not adequate and Labor believes it should be increased, which is why we went to the last election calling for a review of the Newstart payment.\u201d And just a reminder that the daily parliamentary travel allowance is more than the weekly Newstart payment. And just to get ahead of \u201cthose on Newstart get additional payments\u201d comments, Luke Henrique-Gomes broke that down for us earlier this year. When the department broke down the data for the Greens senator Rachel Siewert last year, it found 51.9% of Newstart recipients also got another supplement. (The energy supplement was not separated out of the data, so it is unclear how many received that, and another supplement.) So for the majority of Newstart recipients, the average value of the \u2018other payments\u2019 is $7.32 a week. That is, they don\u2019t live on $39 a day, but about $40 a day (before other costs).\u201d And what would that cost the budget? Sarah Martin has looked at that: The government\u2019s resistance to lifting the Newstart payment comes after a Deloitte Access Economics report last year found a $75-a-week increase to Newstart would lead to a boost in consumer spending, and create more than 10,000 jobs. The report said that increasing the incomes of more than 700,000 people by $10.71 a day would cost the federal budget $3.3bn a year. Unlike the pension, the Newstart payment is linked to prices rather than wages and, since 1994, when the unemployment benefit was last increased in \u2018real terms\u2019, wages have grown 40% faster than prices.\u201d But you know, sUrPlUs. Raise the payment. It\u2019s ridiculous. The Senate will also debate Rachel Siewert\u2019s bill to increase Newstart. \u201cNewstart needs to be increased urgently by at least $75 a week,\u201d the Greens senator said. \u201cWe then have to stop treating income support payments like a political football. An independent process for setting pensions and allowances is well overdue. \u201cLabor and some in the Coalition are clearly feeling the heat when it comes to the abysmally low rate of Newstart, and those in parliament who support an increase to Newstart should vote for it when they get the chance. \u201cThe Greens urge senators and MPs to join the community in the campaign to increase Newstart and support my bill. \u201cIt is untenable that people on Newstart continue to live in poverty. The government should be moving immediately to address the appalling low rate of Newstart. \u201cWhen the people in Parliament work for their community, we can do powerful things together.\u201d Scott Morrison has already said no, which means even if it was passed by the Senate it would be defeated in the House. Richard Marles had a chat to ABC breakfast this morning about Labor\u2019s position on the temporary exclusion orders Peter Dutton wants. Labor supports, in principle, a regime of temporary exclusion orders, and we always have. But we\u2019ve been working cooperatively with the government through the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security. This is complex legislation. It needs to be done in a way that is lawful, in the sense that it needs to be able to survive high court challenges. That\u2019s why this committee is in place and goes through the legislation in detail. There are actually a number of amendments that the committee recommended which Liberal members of the committee supported. We just want to get through the bottom of that and work with the government on that. But at the end of the day, we completely acknowledge the importance of having a temporary exclusion order regime and we\u2019ll work cooperatively with the government to achieve that.\u201d Shadow cabinet will meet later today, followed by caucus where a final decision will be made Sarah Hanson-Young is still pushing for a royal commission into the Murray-Darling basin. That debate will begin in the Senate today. Like the banking royal commission, the Senate\u2019s support for a bill to establish a commission is an essential step in cleaning up the management of the Murray-Darling and stopping the rorts,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cFarmers, communities and ecosystems throughout the basin are suffering. We know there are problems with the way it is being managed, and Australians deserve answers. \u201cMost of the money allocated for the plan has been spent and the river is still in deep trouble. The only way to ensure we get the answers we need, and those responsible are held to account, is with a comprehensive royal commission. \u201cThe South Australia royal commission began this important work but was hampered by the refusal of the federal government and other basin states to participate. A million fish dead and revelations of ongoing mismanagement mean we must have answers.\u201d Rex Patrick has just got back to me. Here is what he had to say: I need to see the evidence that the prime minister is relying on to reach his finding. It needs to cover off on Pyne\u2019s [and Bishop\u2019s] intended role, the reasons for hiring, the expectations of the parties to the employment contracts and the processes and procedure in place in the companies to prevent future breaches [use of knowledge not in the public domain]. I will hear what minister Cormann has to say and then make a decision as to whether to ask the Senate to initiate an inquiry.\u201d So watch this space. Labor had also expressed interest in an inquiry, but without Centre Alliance would not have the numbers. Speaking to ABC radio this morning, Mathias Cormann said the review Martin Parkinson undertook into Julie Bishop\u2019s and Christopher Pyne\u2019s new jobs found neither breached the ministerial standards. \u201cWhat is important is that whatever employment they take on does not put them in breach of the statement of ministerial standards,\u201d he told AM. \u201cAnd the advice that the prime minister has received from the secretary of his department independently is that former ministers Pyne and Bishop are not in breach. \u201cDr Parkinson reviewed all of the relevant information, he spoke to both former ministers Pyne and Bishop, and his advice to the prime minister is there\u2019s no breach of ministerial standards, and that is the advice that I will be providing to the Senate this morning.\u201d The statement of ministerial standards includes this bit: \u201cMinisters are also required to undertake that, on leaving office, they will not take personal advantage of information to which they have had access as a minister, where that information is not generally available to the public.\u201d Rex Patrick from Centre Alliance had wanted to launch a Senate inquiry into the jobs of former ministers, who work in areas related to their former portfolios when they leave parliament. He said he would wait and see the outcome of the prime minister and cabinet department\u2019s review before making up his mind. We have asked him what his thinking is now that Cormann says they are clear. Time flies whether you are having fun or not, and so we find ourselves back in Canberra with the MPs for the first sitting fortnight since the May election. It\u2019s also about the 14th or 15th sitting day this year, so I suppose we shouldn\u2019t complain too much. Because \u2013 democracy. And after this sitting ends on 1 August, parliament won\u2019t sit again until 9 September. It\u2019s been that sort of year. But suddenly national security is once again URGENT. We know this because there were stories in the News Corp papers over the weekend about how many foreign fighters had already returned to Australia. And Deidre Chambers, what a coincidence \u2013 Peter Dutton wants the parliament to give home affairs the power to place temporary exclusion orders on dual citizen foreign fighters, which would keep them out of Australia for at least two years. And the parliament is due to debate that this fortnight. What. Are. The. Chances. Drought will also be back on the agenda \u2013 or at least the drought fund the government wants to set up. Labor will back it if it doesn\u2019t take money from other funds, like infrastructure. So prepare for that debate. Meanwhile the government will attempt to appeal the medevac legislation (Jacqui Lambie is the key vote for that one) and has been made a little more sensitive by the visit from Papua New Guinea\u2019s prime minster, James Marape. Marape wants a timeline on when Australia plans to close its offshore detention centre on Manus Island and also has a few things to say about the awarding of contracts for running the centres. Fun. Oh and smash me down and call me avocado: Mathias Cormann, as one of the only regular government members approved to do regular media spots, was doing the rounds this morning and said a review into Christoper Pyne\u2019s and Julie Bishop\u2019s new jobs has found no breach of the rules. Pyne has been hired as a defence consultant for EY. He was the defence minister about two seconds ago. Bishop has taken a board position with Palladium, which manages hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Dfat contracts. She was the foreign affairs minister about five minutes ago. But Cormann told ABC radio a review by the head of prime minister and cabinet has found \u201cnothing to see here\u201d. We will bring you that and the rest of the day\u2019s news, as it happens. Mike Bowers is on deck running around, no doubt freezing, and forgetting to bring me my coffee, so you\u2019ll have his amazing work to look forward to as well. Katharine Murphy is back from leave, and she\u2019ll be heading up the brains trust of Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. All of them have forgot to bring me a coffee, but I adore them anyway. You\u2019ll find me in the comments, or on Twitter, so drop us a line if you are in the mood. Ready? Let\u2019s get into it",

By any measure Stowers is a remarkable woman. As a child she was a victim of sexual violence, and sought refuge at a Victim Support Group where she began weightlifting and went from being \u201cshy and hopeless\u201d \u2013 her words \u2013 to a world junior and Commonwealth Games champion. Yet having been chosen to be the flag bearer at the Pacific Games, she missed out on two gold medals to a 41-year-old, Laurel Hubbard, who looks set to be one of the biggest stories of Tokyo 2020.</p> <p>The reason? Hubbard is a transgender athlete, who as a male named Gavin did not make a ripple on the international stage until becoming a woman in her mid\u201130s. Now, though, Hubbard is a realistic contender for an Olympic medal and creating a tsunami of protests from women who fear she has an unfair advantage because of the residual benefits of being a male. As the Australian weightlifter Deborah Acason put it: \u201cI feel that if it\u2019s not even, why are we doing the sport?\u201d The Samoan prime minister has also weighed in.</p> <p>This is a contentious and complicated issue. It cuts across sex and gender, fairness and inclusivity. There is also no solution that will satisfy those who insist women\u2019s sport needs to be protected, and others who believe gender identification trumps everything. As one leading expert put it to me last week: \u201cHow can you be fair to everyone? It is almost impossible.\u201d Anyone who enters the debate risks walking on a minefield.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/18/labour-mayors-urge-government-to-speed-up-gender-law-changes-england-wales\">Labour mayors urge government to speed up gender law changes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But when it comes to the science, a new academic paper in the BMJ Journal of Ethics argues that elite transgender women do maintain an advantage when they transition \u2013 and that the current International Olympic Committee policies create what they call an \u201cintolerable unfairness\u201d, because testosterone has much more of an advantage on nearly every sport as opposed to say, being tall, having a large wingspan, or coming from a richer country, which the scientists say is more of a \u201ctolerable unfairness\u201d as it only provides a benefit in some sports.</p> <p>This debate involves numbers, and it can be easy to switch off. But bear in mind the following: women\u2019s testosterone levels range from 0.52 to 2.42 nanomoles per litre, while men\u2019s are 10.41 to 34.70nmol/L. Meanwhile the IOC guidelines for transgender athletes, published in 2015, require them to drop their levels to 10nmol/L for 12 months in order to compete as women \u2013 a figure much higher than normal.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The academics point out that the IOC is making two fundamental assumptions. First, that testosterone is a massive factor in sport. Second, that trans women with levels under 10n/mol have mitigated the performance advantage of their former male physiology. On the first point the IOC is undoubtedly right. Women have 44% less upper body strength \u201cproviding men an advantage for sports like boxing, weightlifting and skiing\u201d, say the academics, while muscle mass differences lead to \u201cdecreased trunk and lower body strength by 64% and 72% respectively in women\u201d. Men also have, on average, larger hearts, greater lung capacity and stronger bones.</p> <p>As the academics note: \u201cThese differences largely underwrite the significant differences in world record times and distances set by men and women.\u201d That, of course, is why women\u2019s sport is protected.

The launch of the Star listing of domestic tech firms is seen as China\u2019s answer to the US\u2019s premier tech index, and an attempt to sidestep American markets in Beijing\u2019s long-running trade war with Washington. It is also considered to be a bold step towards financial market reform, as the Star market features a US-style system for initial public offerings (IPOs). Inaugural trading on Monday involved an initial batch of 25 companies, including chipmaker Anji Microelectronics Technology, which surged 520% from its IPO price in morning trading. That was despite shares having been suspended twice throughout the day by circuit breakers meant to slow a burst in trading. Suzhou Harmontronics Automation Technology soared 113% from its listing price, despite falling 30% at the market opening. The average stock increase across the index was 140%. The moves are rare for Chinese firms, as most local stock markets cap share price gains trading at 44% during the first five days of trading. The new Star market has no such limit.

      "bodyText": "Mathias Cormann has apparently ruled out changing the timetable to lift superannuation to 12%, as renegade Liberal MPs call for increases to be delayed or scrapped. Despite the finance minister\u2019s intervention, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, twice refused to give the same guarantee on Monday, while Liberal senator James Paterson argued no more money should be put into compulsory retirement savings while the system is \u201cbroken\u201d. Last week the Grattan Institute released a report arguing that increasing the superannuation guarantee from 9.5% could harm workers by reducing their take-home pay, and reducing access to the age pension later in life. As parliament resumed on Monday, Labor targeted the Coalition in both houses, citing a report in the Australian quoting seven Liberal MPs either calling for scheduled superannuation increases to be scrapped or arguing workers would prefer more take-home pay. In 2014, the Abbott government froze the superannuation guarantee at 9.5% but \u2013 under current legislation \u2013 it is due to go up to 10% in 2021 and to 12% by 2025. In the Senate, Cormann was asked: \u201cCan you rule out any changes to the timetable for the legislated increases to the superannuation guarantee\u201d contained in the current legislation? \u201cYes,\u201d he replied. But in the house, Morrison said there was \u201cno change\u201d to the government\u2019s policy, refusing to rule it out in future. After Senate question time, Paterson said the government had commissioned a review into retirement incomes on the recommendation of the Productivity Commission, which \u201crecognised it is no good putting more money into super if that system is broken, as we believe it currently is\u201d. Paterson cited reforms to be introduced by the assistant minister for superannuation to prevent fees and inappropriate insurance coverage eating into workers\u2019 savings. \u201cI also think it\u2019s worthwhile for the government review to consider the wisdom of increasing superannuation from 9.5% to 12%,\u201d he told the Senate. Paterson noted that the Treasury under secretary Ken Henry had advised Labor in government against increasing superannuation \u201cbecause it would hurt the take-home pay of Australians\u201d, a result that was replicated by the Grattan Institute\u2019s \u201cvery compelling work\u201d. \u201cWe need to carefully consider whether it\u2019s a good idea [for workers] to potentially receive lower take-home pay and maybe not receive a higher retirement benefit as a result.\u201d Earlier, Liberal MP Tim Wilson told Sky News that he had \u201creservations\u201d about the scheduled superannuation increases \u201cas an alternative to allowing Australians to opt out\u201d of compulsory increases. Wilson said MPs were raising \u201clegitimate questions about whether we should continue to increase the superannuation guarantee versus the alternative of giving people the choice to opt for wage increases so they can do things like pay down debt today\u201d. Wilson argued that increasing the super guarantee \u201cprinciple benefits the wealthy\u201d and said that Australians should have \u201cmaximum choice\u201d over how they use their money. The other Liberals quoted in the Australian\u2019s report questioning the super increases were MPs Craig Kelly, Jason Falinski and Andrew Hastie, and senators Amanda Stoker and Gerard Rennick. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and Labor\u2019s financial services spokesman, Stephen Jones, said that Scott Morrison had \u201cfailed dismally\u201d the test \u201cto stand up to the extremists on his backbench and rule out thieving workers\u2019 super\u201d. \u201cThe Liberals are clearly gearing up for another attack on the retirement incomes of Australian workers,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAt a time when workers\u2019 wages are stagnant, the Liberals also want less money going into their retirement balances as well.\u201d In 2018, the then finance and services minister, Kelly O\u2019Dwyer, indicated the Coalition might prefer to keep the guarantee frozen at 9.5%, arguing that lifting the guarantee would exacerbate sluggish wage growth, but no change to the legislated timetable was formally proposed.",

Could I hold a voice recorder in one hand, phone in the other and push my child in a swing with my foot while I did a work interview in the middle of a playground? Could I shut my baby in the garden, behind some double glazing, to play with the fox poo while I sat at my computer and had a conversation on speakerphone?</p> <p>As a freelance writer, I was lucky enough to have a choice when it came to maternity leave: live on \u00a3140.98 for 39 weeks and risk losing my career, or simply work when the baby slept. For the first year, I chose the latter; on one particularly remarkable occasion managing to submit a tax return while rocking a Moses basket.</p> <p>When my son was not quite a year old, I got the opportunity to interview a photographer for an article. I wanted to do it and so said yes without hesitation. The only snag? I had nobody to look after my child for the hour it would take to do the interview, let alone the time needed to transcribe and write up the conversation. Both his grandmothers were ill, my partner works full-time in a school and I cannot afford nursery.</p> <p>At the time, I didn\u2019t feel able to ask anyone else; the few times I had tried in the past \u2013 attempting to write in my friend\u2019s bedroom while she played with our children downstairs \u2013 my son had stood at the door screaming until I came back into the room. So there I was: a phone, a deadline, a commission and no idea what to do with my child.</p> <p>Would a good mother, I wondered, simply put their child in a sleep bag, dump them in their cot with a pile of snacks, a wooden spoon and some old remote controls for an hour, and hope for the best? A few minutes later, while scrolling through the photographer\u2019s biography online, I learned that he was also a parent of two children. Suddenly, the internalised, patriarchal stupidity of what I was doing hit me. Why did I feel this shame at admitting to someone that, as well as having paid work, I also had a child? Did I really think the sound of a child playing was so revolting that he would hang up? Had I really come to see parenting and professionalism as mutually exclusive?</p> <p>I remembered Jacinda Ardern sitting in the UN General Assembly with her three-month-old daughter, Neve. I thought of Senator Tammy Duckworth casting her vote in the Senate with her newborn daughter Maile in her arms. I thought of Harriet Harman breastfeeding in the House of Commons in 1982. Here I was, in 2018, sweating over a quick phone interview, when so many women have fought so long to simultaneously make money, babies and a difference in the world.</p> <p>So I stopped planning. I stopped trying to shoehorn this tiny, precious human being into a boxfile just so I could work like the big boys. I stopped trying to scrape any trace of motherhood from my voice before work phone calls. I stopped organising meetings on days when I knew someone else would be on hand to wheel my child around the park. I stopped telling editors I was always available at half an hour\u2019s notice. In short, I stopped pretending that I didn\u2019t really have a child at all.</p> <p>That day, I opened the interview by explaining that my infant son was in the room and might make some noise. The photographer said that was absolutely fine. And it was. A few months later, I watched my son scatter raisins across my agent\u2019s carpet while waving around a hairbrush he had liberated from a nearby drawer. Just this week, I interviewed a doctor while breastfeeding my 20-month-old in front of her.</p> <p>I am in the incredibly privileged position of being able to work as a freelancer with family and friends around for help. I am not a single parent. I did not have to go back to full-time work mere weeks after my child was born in order to afford food and heating. I am lucky and I am very grateful for it. But it is important that women such as me, parents such as me, fight to bring the reality of parenting into the world of work. We need to be honest about the pressure, the strain, the juggling, the missed opportunities, the injustice and the work-arounds, in order to make it, hopefully, eventually, fairer for everyone. Sometimes we have to bring our children to offices, rearrange meetings, get our breasts out beside filing cabinets. But we can still work. We can still make it work. The day I stopped trying to work only when my baby was either asleep or absent was the day I decided to claim a new space in the world: one in which I always needed to be paid, might need more time and would probably take up more room. You know, like bosses do.</p>",

In short, I stopped pretending that I didn\u2019t really have a child at all. That day, I opened the interview by explaining that my infant son was in the room and might make some noise. The photographer said that was absolutely fine. And it was. A few months later, I watched my son scatter raisins across my agent\u2019s carpet while waving around a hairbrush he had liberated from a nearby drawer. Just this week, I interviewed a doctor while breastfeeding my 20-month-old in front of her. I am in the incredibly privileged position of being able to work as a freelancer with family and friends around for help. I am not a single parent. I did not have to go back to full-time work mere weeks after my child was born in order to afford food and heating. I am lucky and I am very grateful for it. But it is important that women such as me, parents such as me, fight to bring the reality of parenting into the world of work. We need to be honest about the pressure, the strain, the juggling, the missed opportunities, the injustice and the work-arounds, in order to make it, hopefully, eventually, fairer for everyone. Sometimes we have to bring our children to offices, rearrange meetings, get our breasts out beside filing cabinets. But we can still work. We can still make it work. The day I stopped trying to work only when my baby was either asleep or absent was the day I decided to claim a new space in the world: one in which I always needed to be paid, might need more time and would probably take up more room. You know, like bosses do.",

Here the property speculators Mr Parker and Lady Denham plan an ambitious modern development to rival its longer established neighbours at Brighton, Eastbourne and Worthing. This was not the first time Austen had imagined characters by the sea. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jul/11/reading-group-jane-austens-persuasion-is-julys-book\" title=\"\">Persuasion</a></em>, finished only months before <em>Sanditon</em> was begun, is set in part in Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast. And in her fourth novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/jane-austen-emma-changed-face-fiction\" title=\"\">Emma</a></em>, fretful Mr Woodhouse disputes with his elder daughter Isabella the pros and cons of two resorts for health and sea bathing \u2013 South End, on the Thames estuary, and Cromer, in Norfolk \u2013 their conversation only serving to make Emma, who has never seen the sea, \u201cenvious and miserable\u201d. In the same novel, the seaside, in the shape of Weymouth, provides the clues (overlooked by the landlocked Emma) to the relationship between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill. </p> <p>But <em>Sanditon</em> was Austen\u2019s only truly seaside novel, her only novel to absorb into its structure something of what the seaside has come to represent in later modern fiction \u2013 in, for example, Kate Chopin\u2019s <em>The Awakening </em>(1899), Virginia Woolf\u2019s <em>To the Lighthouse</em> (1927), Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s <em>The Bookshop </em>(1978), John Banville\u2019s <em>The Sea </em>(2005), Ian McEwan\u2019s <em>On Chesil Beach</em> (2007) and Sarah Perry\u2019s <em>The Essex Serpent</em> (2016).</p> <p>Seaside novels are not a single type; nor are they necessarily beach reading. What they share is an understanding of the sea and shore as a place of flux. Where land dissolves into sea, where romantic scenery is the consequence of landslips and cataclysm, the seaside is a space between, a place of transformation and transcendence \u2014 especially of human reality in the face of nature\u2019s great unaccountability. Here the mind responds to limitless views of sea and sky, intimating new beginnings or something darker: dissolution and death. Either way, as the term \u201csea change\u201d suggests, the effect is powerful and mysterious.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6eb7a5b3c856f1a2cdd48a57e3818b9920c748e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb7a5b3c856f1a2cdd48a57e3818b9920c748e5/0_79_2055_1233/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rupert Evans as Frank Churchill in the BBC production of Emma (2009).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rupert Evans as Frank Churchill in the BBC production of <em>Emma</em> (2009)<em>.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laurence Cendrowitz/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout the 18th century, seaside resorts had sprung up along England\u2019s coastline, from Blackpool and Scarborough to Brighton, to take advantage of the fashion for salt-water bathing. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/01/my-hero-william-cowper-harris\" title=\"\">William Cowper</a>, Austen\u2019s favourite poet, put it in \u201cRetirement\u201d (1782): \u201cAll impatient of dry land, agree / With one consent to rush into the sea\u201d.</p> <p>England\u2019s south coast resorts remained fashionable throughout the long years of the Napoleonic war. Their attractions (and dangers) for giddy teenagers such as <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/26/pride-prejudice-200th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Pride and Prejudice</a></em>\u2019<em>s </em>Lydia Bennet, who follows the militia to Brighton, were only enhanced by the presence of army garrisons and scarlet-coated officers. From Brighton, Lydia elopes with George Wickham, who not long before, on a summer visit to Ramsgate, had almost succeeded in seducing 15-year-old Georgiana Darcy. In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2017/jul/11/reading-group-jane-austens-persuasion-is-julys-book\" title=\"\">Persuasion</a></em>, the seaside again proves dangerous when Louisa Musgrove\u2019s foolish leap from the Cobb at Lyme Regis leaves her badly concussed. Not only perilous but exhilarating, the seaside elicits rare moments of sensuous delight from a writer who does not easily let down her guard. A tourist-brochure tribute to Lyme and its neighbour Charmouth intrudes strangely into <em>Persuasion</em>:</p> <p><em>Its sweet retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation \u2026 its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state.</em></p> <p>At Lyme in September 1804, Austen declared the \u201cBathing \u2026 so delightful \u2026 I believe I staid in rather too long\u201d; she also enjoyed holidays at nearby Dawlish and Sidmouth. She may even have experienced her own seaside romance, according to a family rumour \u2013 in one version of events, this was with a nameless young man she met in the summer of 1801; in another, he was a clergyman who promised to return but soon died. In <em>Persuasion</em> the geological upheavals of Dorset\u2019s Jurassic coast echo Anne Elliot\u2019s emotional reawakening after eight empty years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0967bb4404ad358ba5f0b1d08736dc2e01148511\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0967bb4404ad358ba5f0b1d08736dc2e01148511/0_0_6642_3988/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cobb at Lyme Regis, Dorset.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cobb at Lyme Regis, Dorset.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Spraggon/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the seaside world of <em>Sanditon</em> is different from that depicted in Austen\u2019s earlier fiction. Reviewing the novel on its publication in 1925, EM Forster noted its \u201cqueer taste \u2026 which is not easily defined: a double-flavoured taste \u2013 half topography, half romance\u201d. This is not a bad description of the uncertain ground of seaside novels, where the sea scours the land, identity is challenged, relationships falter, houses decay and narrative crumbles. In these stories, the conventions of realism are strained. \u201cHitherto,\u201d Forster commented, \u201cthe face of the earth\u201d was for Austen merely \u201ca site for shrubberies and strawberry beds\u201d; but now \u201canother configuration has been given to the earth \u2026 <em>Sanditon</em> gives out an atmosphere.\u201d</p> <p>Austen\u2019s typical country village implied some-thing permanent and known, its families with their regular routines thrown into temporary excitement by the appearance of strangers: the cynical urbanite Crawfords in <em>Mansfield Park</em>; the metrosexual Frank Churchill in <em>Emma</em>. <em>Sanditon</em> turns everything inside out; visitors, drifting there for one reason or another, outnumber residents. Mr Parker has abandoned his old house and \u201cthe real village of <em>Sanditon</em>\u201d, in pursuit of a vision. On a hilltop looking out to sea, the narrator tells us, \u201cthe Modern began\u201d. In her final work Austen just as decisively sets the traditional village behind her for the half-built development with its empty amenities marching close to the cliff edge.</p> <p>The social scene has widened, dominated by a range of idiosyncratic fantasists: Mr Parker\u2019s sisters, Susan and Diana, meddlesome do-gooders who self-medicate for non-existent illnesses; Sir Edward Denham, a would-be seducer who turns for lifestyle advice to the antiheroes of pulp fiction. Sir Edward has amassed a whole lexicon of hard words in his \u201cliterary alembic\u201d \u2013 \u201canti-puerile\u201d, \u201cindomptible\u201d, \u201ccoruscations of talent\u201d \u2013 which he lobs into conversation to the confusion of his listeners. Diana\u2019s officious acts of charity inspire stylistic insurgency in a narrator striving to keep pace with her creation: she \u201cwas now regaling in the delight of opening the first trenches of an acquaintance\u201d. Trapped inside their new-built schemes and bizarre idiolects, they are incapable of normal communication. This is a society that has lost its social glue. It is, after all, the town built on sand.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Sanditon is a study in fragments of a society in fragments</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Sanditon</em> is a study in fragments of a society in fragments. Does it represent Austen\u2019s verdict on England in 1817? After decades of war, has England lost its moorings? Speculation is the watchword for the resort\u2019s visitors and inhabitants alike: they gamble on land, investments, health, love.</p> <p>Charlotte Heywood, the reader\u2019s eyes and ears, is also a speculator, struggling to process a world she witnesses but never really enters. A young Miss Marple, her detachment, along with the oblique angle of vision that persists through the novel, deepens its air of mystery. After 12 chapters, characters and events have assumed no predictive shape: no obvious heroine, no hero, no marriage plot. The wide panoramas across the South Downs, the seascapes and the sudden mist that descends, obscuring people and things, conspire to make us doubt what is real, what matters.</p> <p>Attempting (and failing) to continue the novel many years after her aunt\u2019s death, Austen\u2019s niece, Anna Lefroy, created sinister backstories for its characters. More recently, in <em>A Cure for All Diseases</em> (2008), Reginald Hill relocated characters and events to Sandytown, Yorkshire, \u201cHome of the Healthy Holiday\u201d. His title, a quotation from Sir Thomas Browne\u2019s <em>Religio Medici</em> (1643) \u2013 \u201cWe all labour against our own cure, for death is the cure of all diseases\u201d \u2013 aptly captures the defiant energy that sparks from Austen\u2019s last pages.</p> <p>Looking out to sea in 1817, Austen, the great realist, appears to question the central impulse of her fiction-making. In <em>Sanditon</em>, the pattern of everyday life is distorted and rearranged. With its cliffs and downs and immense skies, its company of misfits and idlers, and its air of restless anxiety, <em>Sanditon</em> might just be the first English seaside novel </p> <p><em>Kathryn Sutherland is editor of the Oxford World\u2019s Classics edition of Sanditon (OUP, \u00a34.99). ITV\u2019s adaptation of Sanditon airs this autumn.</em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Sanditon, abandoned unfinished in March 1817, four months before Jane Austen died, is set in a fictional fishing village on the Sussex coast. Here the property speculators Mr Parker and Lady Denham plan an ambitious modern development to rival its longer established neighbours at Brighton, Eastbourne and Worthing. This was not the first time Austen had imagined characters by the sea. Persuasion, finished only months before Sanditon was begun, is set in part in Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast. And in her fourth novel, Emma, fretful Mr Woodhouse disputes with his elder daughter Isabella the pros and cons of two resorts for health and sea bathing \u2013 South End, on the Thames estuary, and Cromer, in Norfolk \u2013 their conversation only serving to make Emma, who has never seen the sea, \u201cenvious and miserable\u201d. In the same novel, the seaside, in the shape of Weymouth, provides the clues (overlooked by the landlocked Emma) to the relationship between Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill. But Sanditon was Austen\u2019s only truly seaside novel, her only novel to absorb into its structure something of what the seaside has come to represent in later modern fiction \u2013 in, for example, Kate Chopin\u2019s The Awakening (1899), Virginia Woolf\u2019s To the Lighthouse (1927), Penelope Fitzgerald\u2019s The Bookshop (1978), John Banville\u2019s The Sea (2005), Ian McEwan\u2019s On Chesil Beach (2007) and Sarah Perry\u2019s The Essex Serpent (2016). Seaside novels are not a single type; nor are they necessarily beach reading. What they share is an understanding of the sea and shore as a place of flux. Where land dissolves into sea, where romantic scenery is the consequence of landslips and cataclysm, the seaside is a space between, a place of transformation and transcendence \u2014 especially of human reality in the face of nature\u2019s great unaccountability. Here the mind responds to limitless views of sea and sky, intimating new beginnings or something darker: dissolution and death. Either way, as the term \u201csea change\u201d suggests, the effect is powerful and mysterious. Throughout the 18th century, seaside resorts had sprung up along England\u2019s coastline, from Blackpool and Scarborough to Brighton, to take advantage of the fashion for salt-water bathing. As William Cowper, Austen\u2019s favourite poet, put it in \u201cRetirement\u201d (1782): \u201cAll impatient of dry land, agree / With one consent to rush into the sea\u201d. England\u2019s south coast resorts remained fashionable throughout the long years of the Napoleonic war. Their attractions (and dangers) for giddy teenagers such as Pride and Prejudice\u2019s Lydia Bennet, who follows the militia to Brighton, were only enhanced by the presence of army garrisons and scarlet-coated officers. From Brighton, Lydia elopes with George Wickham, who not long before, on a summer visit to Ramsgate, had almost succeeded in seducing 15-year-old Georgiana Darcy. In Persuasion, the seaside again proves dangerous when Louisa Musgrove\u2019s foolish leap from the Cobb at Lyme Regis leaves her badly concussed. Not only perilous but exhilarating, the seaside elicits rare moments of sensuous delight from a writer who does not easily let down her guard. A tourist-brochure tribute to Lyme and its neighbour Charmouth intrudes strangely into Persuasion: Its sweet retired bay, backed by dark cliffs, where fragments of low rock among the sands make it the happiest spot for watching the flow of the tide, for sitting in unwearied contemplation \u2026 its green chasms between romantic rocks, where the scattered forest trees and orchards of luxuriant growth declare that many a generation must have passed away since the first partial falling of the cliff prepared the ground for such a state. At Lyme in September 1804, Austen declared the \u201cBathing \u2026 so delightful \u2026 I believe I staid in rather too long\u201d; she also enjoyed holidays at nearby Dawlish and Sidmouth. She may even have experienced her own seaside romance, according to a family rumour \u2013 in one version of events, this was with a nameless young man she met in the summer of 1801; in another, he was a clergyman who promised to return but soon died. In Persuasion the geological upheavals of Dorset\u2019s Jurassic coast echo Anne Elliot\u2019s emotional reawakening after eight empty years. But the seaside world of Sanditon is different from that depicted in Austen\u2019s earlier fiction. Reviewing the novel on its publication in 1925, EM Forster noted its \u201cqueer taste \u2026 which is not easily defined: a double-flavoured taste \u2013 half topography, half romance\u201d. This is not a bad description of the uncertain ground of seaside novels, where the sea scours the land, identity is challenged, relationships falter, houses decay and narrative crumbles. In these stories, the conventions of realism are strained. \u201cHitherto,\u201d Forster commented, \u201cthe face of the earth\u201d was for Austen merely \u201ca site for shrubberies and strawberry beds\u201d; but now \u201canother configuration has been given to the earth \u2026 Sanditon gives out an atmosphere.\u201d Austen\u2019s typical country village implied some-thing permanent and known, its families with their regular routines thrown into temporary excitement by the appearance of strangers: the cynical urbanite Crawfords in Mansfield Park; the metrosexual Frank Churchill in Emma. Sanditon turns everything inside out; visitors, drifting there for one reason or another, outnumber residents. Mr Parker has abandoned his old house and \u201cthe real village of Sanditon\u201d, in pursuit of a vision. On a hilltop looking out to sea, the narrator tells us, \u201cthe Modern began\u201d. In her final work Austen just as decisively sets the traditional village behind her for the half-built development with its empty amenities marching close to the cliff edge. The social scene has widened, dominated by a range of idiosyncratic fantasists: Mr Parker\u2019s sisters, Susan and Diana, meddlesome do-gooders who self-medicate for non-existent illnesses; Sir Edward Denham, a would-be seducer who turns for lifestyle advice to the antiheroes of pulp fiction. Sir Edward has amassed a whole lexicon of hard words in his \u201cliterary alembic\u201d \u2013 \u201canti-puerile\u201d, \u201cindomptible\u201d, \u201ccoruscations of talent\u201d \u2013 which he lobs into conversation to the confusion of his listeners. Diana\u2019s officious acts of charity inspire stylistic insurgency in a narrator striving to keep pace with her creation: she \u201cwas now regaling in the delight of opening the first trenches of an acquaintance\u201d. Trapped inside their new-built schemes and bizarre idiolects, they are incapable of normal communication. This is a society that has lost its social glue. It is, after all, the town built on sand. Sanditon is a study in fragments of a society in fragments. Does it represent Austen\u2019s verdict on England in 1817? After decades of war, has England lost its moorings? Speculation is the watchword for the resort\u2019s visitors and inhabitants alike: they gamble on land, investments, health, love. Charlotte Heywood, the reader\u2019s eyes and ears, is also a speculator, struggling to process a world she witnesses but never really enters. A young Miss Marple, her detachment, along with the oblique angle of vision that persists through the novel, deepens its air of mystery. After 12 chapters, characters and events have assumed no predictive shape: no obvious heroine, no hero, no marriage plot. The wide panoramas across the South Downs, the seascapes and the sudden mist that descends, obscuring people and things, conspire to make us doubt what is real, what matters. Attempting (and failing) to continue the novel many years after her aunt\u2019s death, Austen\u2019s niece, Anna Lefroy, created sinister backstories for its characters. More recently, in A Cure for All Diseases (2008), Reginald Hill relocated characters and events to Sandytown, Yorkshire, \u201cHome of the Healthy Holiday\u201d. His title, a quotation from Sir Thomas Browne\u2019s Religio Medici (1643) \u2013 \u201cWe all labour against our own cure, for death is the cure of all diseases\u201d \u2013 aptly captures the defiant energy that sparks from Austen\u2019s last pages. Looking out to sea in 1817, Austen, the great realist, appears to question the central impulse of her fiction-making. In Sanditon, the pattern of everyday life is distorted and rearranged. With its cliffs and downs and immense skies, its company of misfits and idlers, and its air of restless anxiety, Sanditon might just be the first English seaside novel Kathryn Sutherland is editor of the Oxford World\u2019s Classics edition of Sanditon (OUP, \u00a34.99). ITV\u2019s adaptation of Sanditon airs this autumn.",

      "bodyText": "The British foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, is under intense pressure to join US-led plans for an international maritime protection force in the Gulf as signs grow that Iran is preparing for a long standoff over the British-flagged tanker it has detained. As Tehran signalled it would refuse to release the Steno Impero until the UK released an Iranian-flagged ship seized off the coast of Gibraltar a fortnight ago, the British government faced accusations it had failed to sufficiently guard its shipping in the Gulf. Adding to the tensions, the defence minister, Tobias Ellwood, said cuts had left the Royal Navy too small to manage Britain\u2019s interests around the globe. Theresa May will chair a meeting of the government\u2019s emergency committee Cobra at 10.30am BST. As well as receiving the latest updates from ministers and officials, the meeting will discuss the maintenance of the security of shipping in the Gulf. Hunt is due to make a statement to MPs on Monday afternoon. Senior Tory backbenchers including figures close to Boris Johnson, who is expected to become prime minister this week, are angry at the government\u2019s reluctance to accept an offer from Washington to protect British vessels in the region. The capture of the Stena Impero on Friday was widely seen as an avoidable error for which ministers had ample warning. Iain Duncan Smith, a former minister tipped for a cabinet post in a Johnson administration, said the government needed urgently to answer the charge that it had made an error. He said genuine questions had been raised about the UK\u2019s contingency planning after the UK seized the Iranian tanker, Grace 1, on 4 July. \u201cIf something didn\u2019t send an alarm signal that we needed to have serious assets or protection and convoying of our vessels in that area then I want to know why not.\u201d Duncan Smith said his sources had suggested Washington had invited the UK \u201cto use US assets to support British shipping and they were not taken up at that point.\u201d He said he wanted to know why additional UK assets were not speedily dispatched. Hunt is expected to announce limited sanctions directed against members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and to say that the UK is willing to join an international protection force on the right terms. It will also send air assets to the region. On Sunday evening, the Foreign Office confirmed Hunt had spoken with his French and German counterparts who agreed that a \u201csafe passage for vessels\u201d through the economically significant Strait of Hormuz was \u201ca top priority\u201d for Europe. The Foreign Office is seeking a diplomatic solution to the conflict but has advised all British-flagged ships not to enter the Strait of Hormuz. Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said: \u201cWe must restore confidence in the security of ships passing through the strait, and if this necessitates the deployment of more naval vessels from the international community, we would welcome that.\u201d The Iranian government said the length of detention of the mainly Indian crew on Stena Impero depended on the degree of their cooperation. \u201cWe are required by regulations to investigate the issue,\u201d Allahmorad Afifipour, the head of ports and maritime in Hormozgan province, told Iranian state TV. Afifipour said all 23 crew members from the ship were \u201csafe and in good health\u201d. The ship\u2019s owners have asked to visit the crew. Iranian MPs meeting on Sunday welcomed the ship\u2019s capture and made calls for the government to consider imposing tolls on all British and US shipping heading to the Strait, a move that would lead to naval confrontations since the strait is considered international waters. Iranian officials were explicit that the capture on Friday was in retaliation for the capture of Grace 1. The speaker of Iran\u2019s parliament, Ali Larijani, said the British \u201cstole and got a response\u201d from the Revolutionary Guards. Britain privately admits it worked in conjunction with the US in the capture of Grace 1 but says it had independent intelligence that the ship contained oil bound for Syria, in violation of EU sanctions. It says the ship could not have been stopped had it not entered Gibraltarian waters. It is possible ministers underestimated the reaction, particularly since Iran did not attempt any reprisal when the British \u2013 unlike the French or Germans \u2013 blamed the Revolutionary Guards for an attack on two tankers last month. One Whitehall source admitted the government had considered turning a blind eye, admitting that an unworthy part of him had thought: \u201cLet this cup pass from my lips.\u201d Ellwood again demanded the release of the Stena Impero, a call echoed by Oman in whose waters the ship was captured. Speaking on Sky News, Elwood also made a stark call for a reversal of defence cuts. He said: \u201cIf we want to continue playing a role on the international stage \u2013 bearing in mind that threats are changing, all happening just beneath the threshold of all-out war \u2013 then we must invest more in our defence.\u201d Britain has been nervous of the rules of engagement of the US\u2019s long-touted plan for an international maritime security force, nicknamed Operation Sentinel. There is already a UN-endorsed anti-piracy operation off the coast of Somalia, while combined taskforces already operate in the Gulf, dedicated to security and fighting drug-smuggling. There are also issues about the funding of any new larger operation proposed by US Central Command. But, most of all, Britain fears US-led convoys in the Gulf could by accident turn from something passive and defensive into something more volatile. Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister, said on Sunday that the US national security adviser, John Bolton, \u201chaving failed to lure Donald Trump into war of the century \u2026 is turning his venom against the UK in hopes of dragging it into a quagmire.\u201d Iran\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Hamid Baeidinejad, said on Twitter that Britain needed to contain \u201cthose domestic political forces who want to escalate existing tension between Iran and the UK well beyond the issue of ships\u201d. There is an awareness in Iranian circles that the a Johnson premiership could lead to the UK weakening its support for the nuclear deal from which Trump withdrew last year. Meanwhile Iran said it had arrested 17 Iranian nationals allegedly recruited by the CIA to spy on the country\u2019s nuclear and military sites. Some of them have already been sentenced to death, Tehran claimed.",

      "body": "<p>Almost four years ago, the former foreign secretary Jack Straw went on holiday with his wife and a couple of friends to Iran, where he experienced what he calls a \u201cforced conscription into a thriller\u201d. Visiting the cypress of Abarkuh, a tree estimated to be up to 5,000 years old, the foursome were confronted by a group of men dressed in religiously observant black. They were members of the Basij, the thuggish volunteer offshoot of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/12/its-become-a-monster-is-irans-revolutionary-guard-a-terror-group\" title=\"\">the Revolutionary Guards</a>, and they handed Straw a leaflet explaining why he was unwelcome in their country.</p> <p>The document detailed Britain\u2019s perfidious 19th- and 20th-century track record in Iran and claimed that the recently retired Straw was a subversive agent of the British state, using his visit to sow discord. Thereafter the Basij followed the party everywhere until the Iranian police intervened. Armed and undercover, they bundled Straw and his friends into a car, as if they were being kidnapped, and whisked them away into hiding.</p> <p>As Straw drily notes, to be given police protection from criminals and terrorists is one thing, but to be given police protection against other parts of the state is quite another. \u201cI can think of no other country in the world where that occurs,\u201d he writes.</p> <p><em>The English Job: Understanding Iran </em><em>and Why It Distrusts Britain</em> is a response to that strange experience and the accusations made in the Basij leaflet. The book is highly readable, full of vivid history, diplomatic anecdotes and personal observation. It explains the peculiar circumstances of a country finely balanced between becoming a nuclear power and risking international isolation. It\u2019s written in a manner that is balanced, dispassionate and yet sympathetic to the Iranian people.</p> <p>As Straw shows, Iran is a nation that remains anachronistically fixated on the UK, as if it were a superpower capable of extraordinary influence far beyond its shores. There is a reason for this. Britain did once fit that description, and there were few countries in which its long and clandestine reach was felt with more resentment than in Iran.</p> <p>In the 19th century, the Iranian shah Naser al-Din granted Britain what Straw calls \u201cthe most extraordinary and rapacious business concessions\u201d. He did this partly to recruit the British empire as a buffer against Russian encroachment, and partly for personal gain, but its effect was to establish the suspicion that the British had \u201conly malign intentions\u201d for Iran. That suspicion grew steadily and was confirmed in 1953 with Britain\u2019s grubby role, along with the US, in unseating the democratically elected Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in an orchestrated coup. Power then swung to the shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who became increasingly autocratic. Hated by many of his people, he was eventually forced to flee in the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>Straw, who in 2001 became the first senior British minister to visit Iran since the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/feb/03/iranian-revolution-archive\" title=\"\">1979 revolution</a>, is clear-eyed about, and damning of, Britain\u2019s part in empowering the shah. But he\u2019s not about to fall for the flagrant historical revisionism practised by the religious authorities who have held control since Ayatollah Khomeini hijacked the revolution.</p> <p>\u201cThe myth in the Islamic republic today,\u201d writes Straw, \u201cis that the clerics stood foursquare with Mosaddegh. They did the opposite. Their overriding concern, then as now, was to preserve their power and influence within Iran.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b77b2386f9f784007d2855717deb64a5631ce2cf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b77b2386f9f784007d2855717deb64a5631ce2cf/0_0_1583_2048/773.jpg\" alt=\"Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw greets Mohammad Khatami, the former president of Iran, in 2001\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former British foreign secretary Jack Straw greets Mohammad Khatami, whose eight-year tenure as president of Iran ended in 2005, in Tehran in 2001.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That determination has led to a modern nation with enormous potential being strangled by a shadow clerical state that thwarts all attempts at political modernisation. There is, in effect, a two-state system. One is the elected politicians with their ministries and the appearance of a functioning democracy. The other, more powerful, is run by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and ensures democracy is largely cosmetic.</p> <p>There have been several reform-minded presidents who have sought to create a more representative politics at home and a less aggressive image abroad. They have all had to work under the watchful eye of Khamenei, and it has seldom gone well for them. And, should popular resistance grow, Khamenei is not afraid to fix elections, as he almost certainly did in 2009, triggering the Green movement protests.</p> <p>Straw makes the case that Mohammad Khatami, Iran\u2019s president when Straw became foreign minister in 2001, was someone the west could have done business with. He was beginning to push through reforms and, post-9/11, there were signs of international collaboration with the US. But that opportunity was destroyed by the inclusion of Iran in President George W Bush\u2019s infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/31/usa.julianborger\" title=\"\">axis of evil</a> list. No one, it seems, is sure how the phrase \u201caxis of evil\u201d made it into the <a href=\"https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/print/20020129-11.html\" title=\"\">final speech</a>.

Yet it has to be said that the Iranian leadership, under Khamenei, do little to encourage confidence in their actions. They have been playing a game of brinkmanship for many decades that stems in part from fear of foreign meddling but also anxiety about domestic change.</p> <p>It is this tension that goes to the heart of a nation divided between public pretence and private interests. In 2011, members of the Basij \u2013 the group who tried to intimidate Straw on his Iran trip \u2013 ransacked compounds belonging to the British embassy. They smashed almost everything they could, except for one thing: bottles of alcohol, which they stole.</p> <p>Like the nuclear material that Iran is currently processing, that kind of hypocrisy has a dangerous half-life.

He did this partly to recruit the British empire as a buffer against Russian encroachment, and partly for personal gain, but its effect was to establish the suspicion that the British had \u201conly malign intentions\u201d for Iran. That suspicion grew steadily and was confirmed in 1953 with Britain\u2019s grubby role, along with the US, in unseating the democratically elected Iranian prime minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in an orchestrated coup. Power then swung to the shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who became increasingly autocratic. Hated by many of his people, he was eventually forced to flee in the 1979 revolution. Straw, who in 2001 became the first senior British minister to visit Iran since the 1979 revolution, is clear-eyed about, and damning of, Britain\u2019s part in empowering the shah. But he\u2019s not about to fall for the flagrant historical revisionism practised by the religious authorities who have held control since Ayatollah Khomeini hijacked the revolution. \u201cThe myth in the Islamic republic today,\u201d writes Straw, \u201cis that the clerics stood foursquare with Mosaddegh. They did the opposite. Their overriding concern, then as now, was to preserve their power and influence within Iran.\u201d That determination has led to a modern nation with enormous potential being strangled by a shadow clerical state that thwarts all attempts at political modernisation. There is, in effect, a two-state system. One is the elected politicians with their ministries and the appearance of a functioning democracy. The other, more powerful, is run by the supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and ensures democracy is largely cosmetic. There have been several reform-minded presidents who have sought to create a more representative politics at home and a less aggressive image abroad. They have all had to work under the watchful eye of Khamenei, and it has seldom gone well for them. And, should popular resistance grow, Khamenei is not afraid to fix elections, as he almost certainly did in 2009, triggering the Green movement protests. Straw makes the case that Mohammad Khatami, Iran\u2019s president when Straw became foreign minister in 2001, was someone the west could have done business with. He was beginning to push through reforms and, post-9/11, there were signs of international collaboration with the US. But that opportunity was destroyed by the inclusion of Iran in President George W Bush\u2019s infamous axis of evil list. No one, it seems, is sure how the phrase \u201caxis of evil\u201d made it into the final speech. Its original author put it in with the expectation it would be taken out. Similarly, Straw thinks Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA) nuclear deal with Iran is another, though more wilful, mistake. Yet it has to be said that the Iranian leadership, under Khamenei, do little to encourage confidence in their actions. They have been playing a game of brinkmanship for many decades that stems in part from fear of foreign meddling but also anxiety about domestic change. It is this tension that goes to the heart of a nation divided between public pretence and private interests. In 2011, members of the Basij \u2013 the group who tried to intimidate Straw on his Iran trip \u2013 ransacked compounds belonging to the British embassy. They smashed almost everything they could, except for one thing: bottles of alcohol, which they stole. Like the nuclear material that Iran is currently processing, that kind of hypocrisy has a dangerous half-life. Perhaps all that\u2019s preventing a popular uprising is the nationalism fuelled by American hostility.

Is this possible and if so what is the best way to go about this?<br><strong>MN</strong></p> <p><strong>A</strong> Yes it\u2019s perfectly possible for you and your sister to become joint owners of your mother\u2019s house (assuming that\u2019s what your mother wants to happen). But unless you and your sister go and live in the house with your mother \u2013 and carry on living there until her death \u2013 the whole of the value of the property rather than just the value of your mother\u2019s share will be taken into account when working out how much inheritance tax is due. Giving away a part or the whole of something \u2013 whether it\u2019s a property or a valuable antique painting, for example \u2013 while continuing to benefit from it makes it not a proper gift or a \u201cgift with reservation\u201d in the eyes of HMRC and so the whole of the property is included in the valuation of her estate when she dies. So if your mother\u2019s estate is worth more than the \u00a3325,000 nil-rate band if she dies in the 2019-20 tax year, there will be a tax bill of 40% of the amount over \u00a3325,000. However, if your mother\u2019s will says that the family home is to be left to you and/or your sister (or other direct descendant), the nil-rate band goes up to \u00a3475,000 (\u00a3500,000 in the 2020-21 tax year) thanks to the \u201cresidence nil-rate band\u201d or \u201cfamily home allowance\u201d introduced in April 2017.</p> <p>If you were to continue with your plan of you and your sister becoming joint owners with your mother, the best way to do it would be to consult a solicitor. A good one would probably advise against on the grounds that it would make no difference to the eventual inheritance tax bill. He or she might also point out the other disadvantages. If you and your sister sold the house after your mother\u2019s death, you would pay capital gains tax on the increase in value from the date your mother gave you your shares in the house rather than the date of her death so potentially a bigger tax bill. In addition, if your mother had to move to a care home, giving you a share in a property you don\u2019t live in could be construed as a \u201cdeliberate deprivation of assets\u201d by the local authority doing the means test to see how much she had to contribute to her care home costs. If the local authority did think that, then the value of the whole house would be used in the means test and not just the value of her share.</p> <p><strong>Muddled about mortgages?

      "body": "<p>If you were a British Asian in the 90s you will viscerally recall the moment when you first saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/aug/25/goodness-gracious-me-an-asian-comedy-that-everyone-could-relate-to\" title=\"\">Goodness Gracious Me</a>. I was a moody teenager watching telly in bed with the lights off, presumably waiting for something presented by Dani Behr to come on, and it was the sketch about the Asian University.</p> <p>\u201cWe send you out into the world having learned the real value of education,\u201d Meera Syal was saying in a bright RP accent, hair manically GHD-ed in the futile 90s fashion. \u201cPharmacy is better than law \u2026 accountancy is better than engineering \u2026 and medicine is better than anything else you can think of.\u201d My God, it was hilarious. I was so tickled I got out of bed and ventured into the sitting room where, lo, my first-generation Indian parents were also gawping at this foreign visitor to our home: a BBC comedy sketch show made by and for brown people. I joined them on the sofa. We laughed our heads off at people who looked at us, made jokes about us and made jokes about the white people who made jokes (and worse) about us. It was a revelation, the stuff of which white BBC execs\u2019 dreams of diverse programming are made.</p> <p>Twenty years on, the racism is the same (or is it worse?), the latest fashion is moaning about diversity quotas and there still aren\u2019t enough black and Asian comedians on the telly. So Muzlamic (BBC Three) comes at a time like every other: when we need it more than ever.</p> <p>This pilot, at a zippy 15 minutes long, is written and performed by the goofy, occasionally too Ali G-ish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/18/will-allah-be-ok-with-this-muzlamic-bbc-three-first-british-muslim-sketch-show\" title=\"\">comedians Ali Shahalom and Aatif Nawaz</a>. Billed as \u201ca sketch show exploring life from the perspective of two Muslim comedians, or rather, two comedians who happen to be Muslim\u201d, it opens with an almost funny sketch about a pair of Muslim holidaymakers, caps on backwards and beards neatly manicured, being questioned by airport security. When asked if they have ever had any trouble with the police, they offer PDFs and printed copies of their answers to the standard questions, such as: \u201cDo you know Isis?\u201d When they leave, they courteously offer to send in \u201cthe next brown boys, yeah?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say brown. He said it,\u201d the security officer says nervously to the CCTV cameras.</p> <p>Much funnier is the office-based sketch in which the arrival of new guy Samir (\u201cI prefer Sam \u2013 that\u2019s what my wife Elizabeth calls me\u201d) puts an Asian colleague\u2019s nose out of joint. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed you to get a job in Stevenage,\u201d hisses Mo, \u201cbut those people out there are <em>my</em> white people.\u201d An increasingly absurd face-off in which they try to out-white each other follows. \u201cI\u2019m so white I have a loyalty card at Greggs,\u201d boasts Samir. \u201cI\u2019m so white I call my mum and dad by their first names,\u201d Mo bats back. And on it goes until Mo wins with a line about being so white he wipes rather than washes his bum.</p> <p>White fragility, racial stereotyping and unconscious biases are all serious subjects ripe for laughs. In Muzlamic, the material is spot on, but the comedy tends to fall short. In Chat to Me, a female presenter \u2013 and there aren\u2019t enough women here, by which I mean there is one \u2013 interviews the Muslim author of a children\u2019s book. First question? \u201cHow do you feel about 9/11?\u201d She interprets the relationship between a squirrel and older elephant in his book as a comment on grooming gangs then, once the cameras have stopped rolling, asks him to sign a book for her daughter. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d the author asks, defeated but still, as ever, trying to be the good immigrant. \u201cKashmir,\u201d she replies airily. </p> <p>The longest-running and silliest sketch is about Mabz, the gangsta owner of Halal Cuts in Bethnal Green. He is robbed in, the voiceover deadpans, \u201cthe notoriously cut-throat world of east London barbers\u201d and becomes embroiled in a turf war. \u201cCall all my cousins,\u201d he says to a mate on the phone. \u201cYeah, even my dad\u2019s side. Even Asif \u2026 No, not Shahmin, but everyone else.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly razor-sharp (sorry), but then that\u2019s half the point. It doesn\u2019t always have to be cutting edge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you were a British Asian in the 90s you will viscerally recall the moment when you first saw Goodness Gracious Me. I was a moody teenager watching telly in bed with the lights off, presumably waiting for something presented by Dani Behr to come on, and it was the sketch about the Asian University. \u201cWe send you out into the world having learned the real value of education,\u201d Meera Syal was saying in a bright RP accent, hair manically GHD-ed in the futile 90s fashion. \u201cPharmacy is better than law \u2026 accountancy is better than engineering \u2026 and medicine is better than anything else you can think of.\u201d My God, it was hilarious. I was so tickled I got out of bed and ventured into the sitting room where, lo, my first-generation Indian parents were also gawping at this foreign visitor to our home: a BBC comedy sketch show made by and for brown people. I joined them on the sofa. We laughed our heads off at people who looked at us, made jokes about us and made jokes about the white people who made jokes (and worse) about us. It was a revelation, the stuff of which white BBC execs\u2019 dreams of diverse programming are made. Twenty years on, the racism is the same (or is it worse?), the latest fashion is moaning about diversity quotas and there still aren\u2019t enough black and Asian comedians on the telly. So Muzlamic (BBC Three) comes at a time like every other: when we need it more than ever. This pilot, at a zippy 15 minutes long, is written and performed by the goofy, occasionally too Ali G-ish comedians Ali Shahalom and Aatif Nawaz. Billed as \u201ca sketch show exploring life from the perspective of two Muslim comedians, or rather, two comedians who happen to be Muslim\u201d, it opens with an almost funny sketch about a pair of Muslim holidaymakers, caps on backwards and beards neatly manicured, being questioned by airport security. When asked if they have ever had any trouble with the police, they offer PDFs and printed copies of their answers to the standard questions, such as: \u201cDo you know Isis?\u201d When they leave, they courteously offer to send in \u201cthe next brown boys, yeah?\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t say brown. He said it,\u201d the security officer says nervously to the CCTV cameras. Much funnier is the office-based sketch in which the arrival of new guy Samir (\u201cI prefer Sam \u2013 that\u2019s what my wife Elizabeth calls me\u201d) puts an Asian colleague\u2019s nose out of joint. \u201cI don\u2019t know what possessed you to get a job in Stevenage,\u201d hisses Mo, \u201cbut those people out there are my white people.\u201d An increasingly absurd face-off in which they try to out-white each other follows. \u201cI\u2019m so white I have a loyalty card at Greggs,\u201d boasts Samir. \u201cI\u2019m so white I call my mum and dad by their first names,\u201d Mo bats back. And on it goes until Mo wins with a line about being so white he wipes rather than washes his bum. White fragility, racial stereotyping and unconscious biases are all serious subjects ripe for laughs. In Muzlamic, the material is spot on, but the comedy tends to fall short. In Chat to Me, a female presenter \u2013 and there aren\u2019t enough women here, by which I mean there is one \u2013 interviews the Muslim author of a children\u2019s book. First question? \u201cHow do you feel about 9/11?\u201d She interprets the relationship between a squirrel and older elephant in his book as a comment on grooming gangs then, once the cameras have stopped rolling, asks him to sign a book for her daughter. \u201cWhat\u2019s her name?\u201d the author asks, defeated but still, as ever, trying to be the good immigrant. \u201cKashmir,\u201d she replies airily. The longest-running and silliest sketch is about Mabz, the gangsta owner of Halal Cuts in Bethnal Green. He is robbed in, the voiceover deadpans, \u201cthe notoriously cut-throat world of east London barbers\u201d and becomes embroiled in a turf war. \u201cCall all my cousins,\u201d he says to a mate on the phone. \u201cYeah, even my dad\u2019s side. Even Asif \u2026 No, not Shahmin, but everyone else.\u201d It\u2019s not exactly razor-sharp (sorry), but then that\u2019s half the point. It doesn\u2019t always have to be cutting edge.",

It\u2019s a truly magical location, looking across to the islet of Pladda and the Ayrshire coast. Expect to see seals and otters from your tent. Great pub serving food next to site. The circular island bus stops at the campsite gate, making it easy to explore the rest of this stunning place. \u2022 Tent from \u00a39 plus adult \u00a37, camping pods from \u00a340, campingarran.com Graham Ingham St Martin\u2019s, Isles of Scilly Nestled behind an idyllic empty white beach is St Martin\u2019s Campsite. With giant night skies, friendly birdsong and glorious untouched beaches wherever you turn, the island is paradise. The journey is part of the fun. Train to Penzance, then a stroll to the harbour, from where the ferry takes you past west Cornwall\u2019s incredible coastline. Twenty-eight miles later you dock in St Mary\u2019s, where you change to a smaller boat that sails to tiny St Martin\u2019s. \u2022 \u00a312.50pp in July and August, stmartinscampsite.co.uk Natalie Lewis Sark, Channel Islands Accessible by a small ferry is the beautiful La Valette campsite on Sark (which is not actually in the UK but certainly part of Europe: ed). No cars are allowed on the island, so it\u2019s geared towards those on foot. The campsite is basic \u2013 a field with incredible views over the sea and a shower block and two washrooms. Everyone is very helpful \u2013 on arrival, bags are taken off the ferry and delivered to the campsite by tractor. During the day visitors come and go by ferry, and bikes (or horse and carts) can be hired to explore secret plunge pools, bays and cafes. But, once the last day-trippers leave, the island is at its most peaceful \u2013 the best time for your evening swim in Gr\u00e8ve de la Ville Bay. \u2022 \u00a310 adult, \u00a35 child,sark.co.uk Rose Jump Great Langdale, Lake District The 516 bus between Kendal and Windermere passes the Great Langdale campsite at the foot of the Langdale Pikes.

Jump over the stile and you\u2019re at the top of the stairs to the beach, with a chance to grab a delicious snack from the Slow Pig van or a coffee at the kiosk. Here you\u2019ll find a bus stop. The Pembrokeshire bus service is frequent and reliable, linking to bigger hubs in Milford Haven and Pembroke, and buses have delightful names like the Puffin Shuttle. \u2022 One man tent from \u00a35 plus adult \u00a36, child \u00a34, ukcampsite.co.uk Bev Lovatt Burnham Deepdale, Norfolk The coast bus 36 from King\u2019s Lynn or Wells will take you to Deepdale Farm camping (every 30mins in summer and every hour in winter), and you can use it to explore the gorgeous Norfolk coast. Lots of facilities and a quiet site (no noise after 10pm) makes it perfect for families or those looking for a peaceful retreat. Big Norfolk skies mean amazing stargazing opportunities at night. Lots of different pitch options from basic up, and there\u2019s a backpackers\u2019 hostel if you prefer a roof. \u2022 Standard tent for up to five people from \u00a317 a night in August, dorm bed from \u00a321, deepdalebackpackers.co.uk Rachel Treen, Cornwall Hop on the train to Penzance, then bus it to Treen (a 20-minute ride). Treen campsite sits atop the cliff edge with sea views and coastal path leading to the best beach in the world (in my humble opinion). Pedn Vounder beach (clothes optional) is a bit of a scramble to reach, but worth it. Just make sure you arrive early to camp. Logan Rock Inn in Treen village pulls a great pint of Tribute with filling pub grub. Opposite is a farm dispensing unpasteurised fresh milk in the morning (with reusable glass bottles). There\u2019s even a cottage selling freshly baked bread.

The field is often full of wild horses \u2013 also a big part of the camping experience. Gorgeous New Forest countryside trails in three directions direct from the site, and a supermarket is 15 minutes\u2019 walk away. You can even hire out a BBQ, so no need to carry one. \u2022 Tent for two \u00a331 in August, campingintheforest.co.uk Oliver Davis South Downs, East Sussex Housedean Farm near Falmer couldn\u2019t be much easier to get to. A train to Lewes, Falmer or Brighton, then the 28 bus to the doorstep \u2013 it even has its own stop. At the height of summer the view from the site is of rolling slopes in earthy greens and yellows. Pitches are spacious and each has a fire pit. The site has a modern kitchen and high-quality timber showers with constant hot water. Best of all is its commitment to inclusivity \u2013 it says everyone is welcome and this, we found, creates a respectful environment. The location is a great base from which to explore the South Downs national park (the site is on the South Downs Way). Peter Sharpe Cairngorms, Highland The Glenmore campsite sits on the sandy banks of the beautiful Loch Morlich. It\u2019s a 10-minute hop on the 31 bus from Aviemore and its well-connected rail station. Nearby are Cairn Gorm (the UK\u2019s sixth-highest peak), the beautiful Rothiemurchus estates and lochs galore. It also has the best tiny pub ever, the Pine Marten. \u2022 Tent for two from \u00a325pn in August, campingintheforest.co.uk Fraser Mann EUROPE Calvi, Corsica Join a stately railway line from Ajaccio to get to Calvi. The trains may be recent, but this is a metre-gauge line built in the late 19th century. With stunning views the slow trip must be seen as a holiday experience rather than a means of travelling from A to B. Approaching Calvi the train stops at a beach halt 25 minutes along the boardwalk from the town itself, but just a few hundred metres from Camping La Pin\u00e8de. We stayed in a simple two-person Roulotte caravan.

      "body": "<p>Disney\u2019s new remake of The Lion King roared into theaters over the weekend, arriving as the culmination of a decade-long endeavor to revitalize (or at least squeeze a few more dollars out of) the studio\u2019s deep library of beloved animated classics. Simba\u2019s lesson in the art of <em>hakuna matata </em>marks the 10th such release, the new doctrine having been launched back in 2010 with Tim Burton\u2019s vision of Alice in Wonderland.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/18/the-30-greatest-disney-songs-ranked\">The 30 greatest Disney songs \u2013\u00a0ranked!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Going purely on dollars and cents, it\u2019s been a fabulously successful experiment, though the question of whether it all passes muster on the grounds of entertainment merits a longer and more involved conversation. For as much as this new wave of polished-up favorites has bewitched audiences by droves, it has often left critics and more discerning viewers cold. Are these films innocently refurbishing cherished parts of our childhoods so that they might be adored by a new generation, or is this the work of a corporate colossus intent on wringing every last dollar out of its stable of characters no matter the creative compromise required?</p> <p>To land on an answer \u2013 as with most things, it\u2019s somewhere in the middle \u2013 the Guardian took a deep dive into the current era of Disney and compiled the ranking below. From the most dismal cash-in to an exhilarating rework inspiring hope for the future, here\u2019s the full lowdown:</p> <h2><strong>10. Alice Through the Looking Glass</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bf6877cc5a86643c5889f2c3d80b09767c527d19\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf6877cc5a86643c5889f2c3d80b09767c527d19/0_0_1848_1024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mia Wasikowska\" width=\"1000\" height=\"554\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If 2010\u2019s previous adventure with Alice represented a new low of creative coasting for director Burton, its sequel marks the complete cannibalizing of his technique as an auteur. James Bobin steps in to fill the vacuum of talent left behind when Burton shifted to producer, mostly by aping the most superficial elements of his predecessor\u2019s work \u2013 goth-lite flourishes, outr\u00e9 couture, a possibly fatal overdose of whimsy \u2013 in a diluted form. Piling on mythologies that even Lewis Carroll might have found a touch convoluted, Bobin sends Alice on a bland time-traveling journey through a realm of incoherent digitized glop to save Johnny Depp\u2019s Mad Hatter, a character the film greatly overestimates as worth saving. The six-year gap between installments really emphasizes how little this was needed, and lays bare the money-minded imperatives fueling Disney\u2019s collective remake project.</p> <h2><strong>9. The Lion King</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50df5655435a3a365436c9a45852b7d9fe8a802f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50df5655435a3a365436c9a45852b7d9fe8a802f/0_0_8950_5217/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>After spinning a massive payday out of The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau returned to the House of Mouse for another photorealist fantasy with a core cast out of the kingdom Animalia. Chalk it up to laziness or reverence for the original, but this time around, Favreau nearly went shot-by-shot in his recreation of the 1994 masterpiece. The result of this experiment in boundary-pushing animation technology is an eyesore utterly devoid of imagination, exuberance or any signs of life. The simple inability of the animal characters to emote causes plenty of trouble; add to that a sleepy voice performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight? takes place during the day and a disappointing paucity of Beyonc\u00e9. It\u2019s an unattractive and joyless film, seemingly for no one.</p> <h2><strong>8. Aladdin</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0f9494fb10fcd8f9f621ab658aa07d8132891e4b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f9494fb10fcd8f9f621ab658aa07d8132891e4b/0_281_4353_2613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The harrowing sight of a gigantic cerulean Will Smith will haunt youngsters for years to come, and yet there\u2019s little else memorable about Guy Ritchie\u2019s take on the Arabian Nights folktale. He stages the musical numbers that haven\u2019t been tossed by the wayside with some panache, but directs the intervening passages with minimal distinction. Ritchie\u2019s spent his whole career choreographing and capturing fleet-footed chases, and now that he has got the full arsenal of Disney\u2019s resources at his disposal to follow Aladdin (Mena Massoud), he pulls off the throttle? Saturday Night Live alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s amusing supporting turn as a handmaiden pretty much cancels out a dull and creakily pseudo-feminist slant on Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott), leaving little else to savor. Meanwhile, Smith\u2019s streetwise genie pales in comparison to Robin Williams\u2019 nonstop barrage of schtick, one big shape-shifting flaw in the new film\u2019s comedic bedrock, though the end credits rap from the former Big Willie Style straddles the line of being so bad it circles back to good again.</p> <h2><strong>7. Beauty and the Beast</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"02271e932c200449b82c32e86be969a34d6e91f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02271e932c200449b82c32e86be969a34d6e91f8/53_0_5510_3307/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Emma Watson took one of her infrequent acting jobs to breathe new life into Belle, making the kept woman into something sturdier. Even so, her princess-in-spite-of-herself can\u2019t hold a singing candle to the original, and her nonhuman companions don\u2019t come off looking much better. This is where we start to see Disney losing its way in terms of CGI design, even as the studio made its execution more sophisticated than ever; Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs Potts and the rest of the domestic-furnishing crew lose all their visual warmth and charm in pursuit of a more realistic standard. Not to mention the Dan Stevens-played Beast, looking less like a mammalian hunk and more like a failed genetic experiment. Both he and Watson put their best foot forward, and despite their sincerest efforts, the film often feels like an imitation at once chintzy and overly expensive.</p> <h2><strong>6. Alice in Wonderland</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"119008e17dde7a98a02230ca7042165b9c0d9070\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/119008e17dde7a98a02230ca7042165b9c0d9070/219_0_3285_1972/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Burton\u2019s first dalliance with Disney stands out as the patient zero to which this whole trend can be traced back, its highly lucrative transmogrifying of intellectual property putting dollar signs in executives\u2019 eyes for the rest of the 10s. But to make this deal with the devil, the one-time ambassador to the morose Hot Topic set made some glaring artistic concessions placing him in line with a much duller channel of the mainstream. The German Expressionist influence has vanished, replaced by torrents of garbled digital imagery and washed-out color schemes distorting light\u2019s brilliance and the shadows it casts. As young Alice turns warrior in the Joseph Campbell mode, Mia Wasikowska lets everyone know how good she could be in a vehicle making proper use of her skills and screen presence. The rest of the colorful supporting turns shake out as hit-or-miss, with more in the former category (Alan Rickman\u2019s hookah-smoking caterpillar, a hysterical Helena Bonham Carter as the bigheaded Queen of Hearts) than the latter (Johnny Depp\u2019s grating Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway\u2019s miscalculated White Queen).</p> <h2><strong>5. Dumbo</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5321e7c90cedac9e153587d57faa5bf6d994a997\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5321e7c90cedac9e153587d57faa5bf6d994a997/107_0_1970_1182/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Burton got a little bit of the old spirit back with his most recent Disney collaboration, undoubtedly aided by the casting of regular pal Danny DeVito as the grumbling manager of a barely solvent circus. The milieu, with its vertical stripes and elaborate outfits and harsh footlights, came well-suited to the director\u2019s house style. Regardless, he could do little to salvage a thoroughly mangled script foregrounding two exquisitely annoying human kids while shunting Dumbo himself off to a tertiary role. (Though the film\u2019s glaring subtext \u2013 that corporate conglomeration is bad, kiddos, killing art and precipitating cutbacks \u2013 comes as a bracing tonic in the wake of Disney\u2019s gobbling-up of Fox.) While clearing the bar he had set for himself with his take on Alice and Co, Burton gave away just how low it had been placed, as his film contains scarcely an iota of the original\u2019s frightening surrealism. The high-gloss approximation of the pink elephant scene does a disservice to the nightmarish quality of its forefather.</p> <h2><strong>4. Maleficent</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9dadfa587563d98082a3818cb9b88731c5bb4f3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dadfa587563d98082a3818cb9b88731c5bb4f3b/0_89_4200_2519/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Casting Angelina Jolie and her superhuman cheekbones as the nefarious queen tormenting Sleeping Beauty qualifies as a stroke of genius, though it\u2019s not quite enough to carry this revisionist take on the fairytale. She offers an alternative portrait of the villain steeped in the tragic, a backstory in which she\u2019s wronged by a cruel man, defamed as a vindictive woman, and only restored to power through embracing the reputation assigned to her. It all sounds significantly more interesting than it turns out to be, possibly because this is a grown-up character study forced to contort itself into the shape of a fun-for-the-family blockbuster.

For one, this film illustrates the paramount importance of having a human actor in the lead, his expressive appearance a crucial mirror reflecting back the tone of the animals\u2019 dialogue. With newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli, the reaction shot (a fairly fundamental unit of film-making) becomes a possibility. There has been more thought put into the voice casting as well, from Bill Murray\u2019s lackadaisical delivery as Baloo to Scarlett Johansson mesmerizing croon as the hypnoserpent Kaa. But the film truly excels by allowing itself to slow down and take it easy, adopting the leisurely pace and emphasis on the easy life that entrenched the earlier film in its year of 1967. Even if Favreau overwrites the look of the film, he has the good sense not to dispose of its spirit.</p> <h2><strong>2.

      "bodyText": "Disney\u2019s new remake of The Lion King roared into theaters over the weekend, arriving as the culmination of a decade-long endeavor to revitalize (or at least squeeze a few more dollars out of) the studio\u2019s deep library of beloved animated classics. Simba\u2019s lesson in the art of hakuna matata marks the 10th such release, the new doctrine having been launched back in 2010 with Tim Burton\u2019s vision of Alice in Wonderland. Going purely on dollars and cents, it\u2019s been a fabulously successful experiment, though the question of whether it all passes muster on the grounds of entertainment merits a longer and more involved conversation. For as much as this new wave of polished-up favorites has bewitched audiences by droves, it has often left critics and more discerning viewers cold. Are these films innocently refurbishing cherished parts of our childhoods so that they might be adored by a new generation, or is this the work of a corporate colossus intent on wringing every last dollar out of its stable of characters no matter the creative compromise required? To land on an answer \u2013 as with most things, it\u2019s somewhere in the middle \u2013 the Guardian took a deep dive into the current era of Disney and compiled the ranking below. From the most dismal cash-in to an exhilarating rework inspiring hope for the future, here\u2019s the full lowdown: 10. Alice Through the Looking Glass If 2010\u2019s previous adventure with Alice represented a new low of creative coasting for director Burton, its sequel marks the complete cannibalizing of his technique as an auteur. James Bobin steps in to fill the vacuum of talent left behind when Burton shifted to producer, mostly by aping the most superficial elements of his predecessor\u2019s work \u2013 goth-lite flourishes, outr\u00e9 couture, a possibly fatal overdose of whimsy \u2013 in a diluted form. Piling on mythologies that even Lewis Carroll might have found a touch convoluted, Bobin sends Alice on a bland time-traveling journey through a realm of incoherent digitized glop to save Johnny Depp\u2019s Mad Hatter, a character the film greatly overestimates as worth saving. The six-year gap between installments really emphasizes how little this was needed, and lays bare the money-minded imperatives fueling Disney\u2019s collective remake project. 9. The Lion King After spinning a massive payday out of The Jungle Book, Jon Favreau returned to the House of Mouse for another photorealist fantasy with a core cast out of the kingdom Animalia. Chalk it up to laziness or reverence for the original, but this time around, Favreau nearly went shot-by-shot in his recreation of the 1994 masterpiece. The result of this experiment in boundary-pushing animation technology is an eyesore utterly devoid of imagination, exuberance or any signs of life. The simple inability of the animal characters to emote causes plenty of trouble; add to that a sleepy voice performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, the fact that Can You Feel the Love Tonight? takes place during the day and a disappointing paucity of Beyonc\u00e9. It\u2019s an unattractive and joyless film, seemingly for no one. 8. Aladdin The harrowing sight of a gigantic cerulean Will Smith will haunt youngsters for years to come, and yet there\u2019s little else memorable about Guy Ritchie\u2019s take on the Arabian Nights folktale. He stages the musical numbers that haven\u2019t been tossed by the wayside with some panache, but directs the intervening passages with minimal distinction. Ritchie\u2019s spent his whole career choreographing and capturing fleet-footed chases, and now that he has got the full arsenal of Disney\u2019s resources at his disposal to follow Aladdin (Mena Massoud), he pulls off the throttle? Saturday Night Live alum Nasim Pedrad\u2019s amusing supporting turn as a handmaiden pretty much cancels out a dull and creakily pseudo-feminist slant on Princess Jasmine (Naomi Scott), leaving little else to savor. Meanwhile, Smith\u2019s streetwise genie pales in comparison to Robin Williams\u2019 nonstop barrage of schtick, one big shape-shifting flaw in the new film\u2019s comedic bedrock, though the end credits rap from the former Big Willie Style straddles the line of being so bad it circles back to good again. 7. Beauty and the Beast Emma Watson took one of her infrequent acting jobs to breathe new life into Belle, making the kept woman into something sturdier. Even so, her princess-in-spite-of-herself can\u2019t hold a singing candle to the original, and her nonhuman companions don\u2019t come off looking much better. This is where we start to see Disney losing its way in terms of CGI design, even as the studio made its execution more sophisticated than ever; Cogsworth, Lumiere, Mrs Potts and the rest of the domestic-furnishing crew lose all their visual warmth and charm in pursuit of a more realistic standard. Not to mention the Dan Stevens-played Beast, looking less like a mammalian hunk and more like a failed genetic experiment. Both he and Watson put their best foot forward, and despite their sincerest efforts, the film often feels like an imitation at once chintzy and overly expensive. 6. Alice in Wonderland Burton\u2019s first dalliance with Disney stands out as the patient zero to which this whole trend can be traced back, its highly lucrative transmogrifying of intellectual property putting dollar signs in executives\u2019 eyes for the rest of the 10s. But to make this deal with the devil, the one-time ambassador to the morose Hot Topic set made some glaring artistic concessions placing him in line with a much duller channel of the mainstream. The German Expressionist influence has vanished, replaced by torrents of garbled digital imagery and washed-out color schemes distorting light\u2019s brilliance and the shadows it casts. As young Alice turns warrior in the Joseph Campbell mode, Mia Wasikowska lets everyone know how good she could be in a vehicle making proper use of her skills and screen presence. The rest of the colorful supporting turns shake out as hit-or-miss, with more in the former category (Alan Rickman\u2019s hookah-smoking caterpillar, a hysterical Helena Bonham Carter as the bigheaded Queen of Hearts) than the latter (Johnny Depp\u2019s grating Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway\u2019s miscalculated White Queen). 5. Dumbo Burton got a little bit of the old spirit back with his most recent Disney collaboration, undoubtedly aided by the casting of regular pal Danny DeVito as the grumbling manager of a barely solvent circus. The milieu, with its vertical stripes and elaborate outfits and harsh footlights, came well-suited to the director\u2019s house style. Regardless, he could do little to salvage a thoroughly mangled script foregrounding two exquisitely annoying human kids while shunting Dumbo himself off to a tertiary role. (Though the film\u2019s glaring subtext \u2013 that corporate conglomeration is bad, kiddos, killing art and precipitating cutbacks \u2013 comes as a bracing tonic in the wake of Disney\u2019s gobbling-up of Fox.) While clearing the bar he had set for himself with his take on Alice and Co, Burton gave away just how low it had been placed, as his film contains scarcely an iota of the original\u2019s frightening surrealism. The high-gloss approximation of the pink elephant scene does a disservice to the nightmarish quality of its forefather. 4. Maleficent Casting Angelina Jolie and her superhuman cheekbones as the nefarious queen tormenting Sleeping Beauty qualifies as a stroke of genius, though it\u2019s not quite enough to carry this revisionist take on the fairytale. She offers an alternative portrait of the villain steeped in the tragic, a backstory in which she\u2019s wronged by a cruel man, defamed as a vindictive woman, and only restored to power through embracing the reputation assigned to her. It all sounds significantly more interesting than it turns out to be, possibly because this is a grown-up character study forced to contort itself into the shape of a fun-for-the-family blockbuster. The interior character work that undoubtedly attracted Jolie to the job takes a back seat to flashy trailer-ready moments, though the idea it leaves behind (that some of history\u2019s most loathed women were secretly the victims behind the scenes) can endure. 3. The Jungle Book Another Favreau production with lifelike talking animals, a dearth of musical numbers, and a verdant setting overflowing with life \u2013 what did he do right here that would go so horribly awry just three years later? For one, this film illustrates the paramount importance of having a human actor in the lead, his expressive appearance a crucial mirror reflecting back the tone of the animals\u2019 dialogue. With newcomer Neel Sethi as Mowgli, the reaction shot (a fairly fundamental unit of film-making) becomes a possibility.

Even if Favreau overwrites the look of the film, he has the good sense not to dispose of its spirit. 2. Cinderella Kenneth Branagh\u2019s no stranger to spectacle, it\u2019s just that he usually gets his grandeur from the backlog of the Bard instead of Walt Disney. His style of stately opulence fit the storybook subject matter like a glass slipper, revitalizing the kingdom and its inhabitants with ravishing costumes and production design befitting the monarchy. Lily James holds it together as our riches-to-rags-to-riches-again heroine, but the real star of the show has to be Cate Blanchett, who spices up the role of the evil stepmother with a dash of Norma Desmond and a sprinkle of the Wicked Witch. While the computer-animated pumpkin carriage lacks the magic of the genuine article, the additional attempts to update or otherwise modernize do little to disrupt the bedtime fable atmosphere viewers can still feel nostalgic about. 1. Pete\u2019s Dragon Director David Lowery may be the only one to have realized the full potential of Disney\u2019s remake campaign, starting from square one to completely reshape the given property into a fully formed work with its own fresh themes and aesthetic \u2013 you know, a real movie.

      "bodyText": "On 1 July, Missy Cole was notified by her bank that her husband\u2019s most recent paycheck had bounced, leaving their account more than $1,000 in the red. Her husband had worked as a coalminer for nearly three years at one of the eastern Kentucky mines operated by Revelation Energy affiliate Blackjewel mining. But both companies had filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy, a financial move that has implications far beyond just laying off staff as the ex-workers now wait for bankruptcy proceedings to play out. Critics say the move is a ploy increasingly used in the struggling industry to avoid paying workers what they are owed. \u201cA layoff is always expected with miners. It\u2019s always in the back of your mind and it\u2019s no surprise when it happens in the coal industry. But this is much more than a layoff,\u201d Cole told the Guardian. \u201cWe have absolutely no access to our bank accounts. Those accounts are still negative, and falling deeper into the negative daily. We cannot even touch his 401(k) to withdraw money to survive on without the signature of the Blackjewel mining CEO or his personnel.\u201d One of the largest coalmining operators in the United States, Blackjewel abruptly shut its mines after filing for bankruptcy, jeopardizing the jobs of about 1,700 workers in Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky and Wyoming. Workers are still unsure if they will be permitted to return to work and for how long, if they will be paid for bounced checks and what will happen to their health insurance and benefits. \u201cIt\u2019s been very hard, not knowing if your going to be able to put food on the table for your three kids,\u201d said Mark Turner, a Kentucky miner at a Blackjewel-operated mine. He\u2019s unsure how he is going to afford his upcoming house payment, electric bill or buy clothes and supplies for his children with the new school year approaching. Jimmy Justus, 22, a mine worker for Blackjewel in Virginia, owes his bank more than $1,400 because his last paycheck bounced. \u201cNow my account has been closed,\u201d he said. On 1 July, Justus was sent home under the impression work would restart the next day, but then heard from co-workers the company had filed for bankruptcy. \u201cThe day-shift foreman had no intention of telling anyone anything.\u201d Another coal worker in Virginia, Mark Atwell, was on vacation with his family at Dollywood when he discovered his last paycheck had bounced. \u201cI had no money to feed my family or even gas to get back home on,\u201d Atwell said, who has three children and a disabled wife. According to the bankruptcy filing, Blackjewel mining has at least $500m owed in liabilities. A worker in Wyoming has filed a class action lawsuit against the company, which claims the company failed to give employees\u2019 proper notice, and wages and benefits earned before and after the bankruptcy filing. Blackjewel is the third large US coal company to declare bankruptcy since May 2019, despite promises from Donald Trump that he would save the coal industry and its jobs. Since Trump took office, about 2,000 jobs have been added to the coal industry, which currently employs an estimated 53,000 workers. The industry has shed more than 30,000 jobs in the past decade, driven by automation and changes in the energy industry, as renewable sources recently surpassed coal production for the first time ever in the US, and natural gas production hit a record high in 2018. Through filing bankruptcies, attorneys who have represented coalminers argue current laws allow operators to avoid obligations they have to workers. \u201cIt is especially egregious where Blackjewel bounces paychecks to the employees. This compounds with the loss of health insurance and other benefits,\u201d said Jack Jacobs, an Alabama-based attorney who has represented workers in black lung cases. \u201cThe miners work very hard and sacrifice a lot for these operators. Very frustrating to see how their loyalty is repaid.\u201d Attorney Shannon Anderson with the Powder River Basin Resource Council in Wyoming condemned the management of Blackjewel by its CEO, Jeff Hoops, who was recently forced to resign. Hoops did not respond to a request for comment. Anderson said: \u201cHoops was buying up distressed assets from bankruptcies and companies trying to offload mines that were no longer economically viable, and basically created a coal company with those assets.\u201d She said several Blackjewel-operated mines in Appalachia racked up various environmental violations and citations as the company operated at a loss and tried to keep costs as low as possible. She added: \u201cNone of these mines were making money and he was paying himself before any of the lenders, and basically running these mines at very low cost.\u201d Because Blackjewel LLC is privately owned, Anderson noted there is less public disclosure into what\u2019s going on with the company, leaving many questions unanswered for workers, their communities and if Hoops will be held accountable. \u201cAll the information we\u2019re getting is more or less off of social media and other co-workers in other states,\u201d said Joe Williamson, a Blackjewel coal worker in Virginia. Hoops resigned as a condition for a $5m emergency loan, though his multimillion-dollar plans to build a resort in West Virginia will reportedly not be impacted by the bankruptcy. In a letter to workers, Hoops claimed \u201cno one is hurting more than me\u201d as a result of the bankruptcy. Few workers agree. \u201cOur paychecks bounced,\u201d said Jeffery Cochran, a coalminer in Kentucky who has worked at a Blackjewel-operated mine for nearly four years. \u201cSome people have been denied unemployment which is owed to us. He didn\u2019t pay into it for some people, but yet he can build a $30m resort, and doesn\u2019t have to pay us.\u201d A representative for Blackjewel shared a press release issued on 10 July that noted about 140 employees have returned to work, and they would be paid for prior and future work, but did not address bounced checks for employees outside of Wyoming or the fees workers are accruing due to bounced checks and late bill payments.",

It comes after a high-stakes weekend in which a recording emerged of Iranian coastguards telling a British Royal Navy frigate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/iranian-coastguards-radio-exchange-with-uk-warship-emerges\">they wanted to inspect the captured Stena Impero oil tanker for security reasons</a>.

He is expected to announce limited sanctions directed against members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and to say that the UK is willing to join an international protection force on the right terms. Last night the Foreign Office confirmed Hunt had spoken to his French and German counterparts who agreed that safe passage for vessels through the vital strait of Hormuz was \u201ca top priority\u201d.</p> \n<p>Iran has made it clear that the tanker\u2019s detention was retaliation for the capture of the Iranian-flagged Grace 1 off Gibraltar. The speaker of Iran\u2019s parliament, Ali Larijani, said Britain \u201cstole and got a response\u201d from the Revolutionary Guards. All British shipping is still advised to avoid the area.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Tory high-noon</strong> \u2013 Any hopes in the Boris Johnson camp that there might be a smooth transition to No 10 this week took a drubbing with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/21/ministers-resignations-could-disrupt-boris-johnson-brexit-plans\">the promised resignations of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the justice secretary, David Gauke</a>. Others opposed to a hard Brexit may follow. Johnson is widely expected to be anointed as the party\u2019s new leader tomorrow (postal ballots from Conservative party members close at 5pm today). He will face a perilous political climate on multiple fronts \u2013 attempts to thwart a no-deal Brexit, a wafter-thin working majority of three that may vanish by the time MPs return from the summer recess, with mooted defections to the Lib Dems coming on top of a predicted byelection defeat. Not to mention the diplomatic tensions with Iran. Theresa May will hold a valedictory PM\u2019s question time tomorrow before Johnson is expected to head to the Palace on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Still on politics and the Liberal Democrats will announce their new leader this afternoon to replace Vince Cable. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Jo Swinson, and the former energy secretary, Ed Davey, are both hoping to be elected to the position.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>\u2018Where were the police?\u2019 </strong>\u2013 Hong Kongers have vented their fury over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/22/where-were-the-police-hong-kong-outcry-after-masked-thugs-launch-attack\">an attack by masked men at a train station</a>, in which commuters, including women and children, were indiscriminately attacked with wooden bats. Dozens were hospitalised and one person was critically injured in the incident, which followed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/21/hong-kong-police-fire-rubber-bullets-as-protests-turn-violent\">large anti-government march in the city on Sunday</a> that descended into chaos as police and protesters fought running battles, with riot police firing teargas and rubber bullets. Video showed passengers using umbrellas to shield themselves from the unidentified attackers, who some some suspect of having links to triad gangs.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Payback time </strong>\u2013 Rail passengers have been urged to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/uk-rail-passengers-lost-out-on-100m-pounds-compensation-last-year\">seek compensation for every delay they suffer </a>after missing out on an estimated \u00a3100m in payouts last year. Transport Focus, the UK industry watchdog, said passengers should send a message to train operators that reliability must keep improving. \u201cWhen things go wrong train operators must ensure every eligible passenger knows about Delay Repay and how to claim,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief executive, Anthony Smith. Research by the rail industry suggests train operators have been reluctant to advertise passengers\u2019 right to compensation, with 82% of delayed passengers entitled to a payout saying they did not hear any announcement on the train or at the station informing them they could make a claim.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Tumble dryer danger </strong>\u2013 Whirlpool will today recall an estimated 500,000 machines at risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/sep/24/killer-tumble-dryer-faulty-whirlpool-machine-product-safety-scandal\">bursting into flames</a>, four years after safety concerns in the UK first emerged.

The government ordered an \u201cunprecedented\u201d recall of the machine recall last month, escalating the long-running controversy. \u201cThe official recall of these machines is welcome but we believe should have been implemented years ago,\u201d said Martyn Allen, the technical director of Electrical Safety First.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Weather warning</strong> \u2013 The UK will experience a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/21/uk-weather-heatwave-to-come-after-storm-and-gales\">brief heatwave this week</a>, but not before a storm brings torrential rain and strong gales to some areas. The Met office issued a yellow alert for western parts of Scotland for today, with thunderstorms and a risk of flooding. But stand by with the suncream for later in the week when temperatures are expected to hit 34C (93F) across central, southern and eastern areas. \u201cHeatwave thresholds are likely to be reached in some places,\u201d said the office\u2019s chief meteorologist, Andy Page.</p> \n<h2>Today in Focus podcast: Stranded in Pakistan: why did the Home Office deny a baby a visa?</h2> \n<p>Nina Saleh, a British resident for 20 years, travelled to Pakistan to adopt a baby.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Jeremy Hunt to address Commons Good morning, I\u2019m Alison Rourke and welcome to this Monday morning briefing. In one of her final acts as prime minister, Theresa May will chair a crucial meeting in Downing Street this morning to address how to secure British shipping in the Gulf as the standoff over oil tankers continues. It comes after a high-stakes weekend in which a recording emerged of Iranian coastguards telling a British Royal Navy frigate they wanted to inspect the captured Stena Impero oil tanker for security reasons. It was at odds with Tehran\u2019s previous suggestions that the ship, now languishing in an Iranian port, was seized because of a collision with a fishing vessel. Jeremy Hunt will address the Commons today in what is looking increasingly like a diplomatic minefield. He is expected to announce limited sanctions directed against members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and to say that the UK is willing to join an international protection force on the right terms. Last night the Foreign Office confirmed Hunt had spoken to his French and German counterparts who agreed that safe passage for vessels through the vital strait of Hormuz was \u201ca top priority\u201d. Iran has made it clear that the tanker\u2019s detention was retaliation for the capture of the Iranian-flagged Grace 1 off Gibraltar. The speaker of Iran\u2019s parliament, Ali Larijani, said Britain \u201cstole and got a response\u201d from the Revolutionary Guards. All British shipping is still advised to avoid the area. * * * Tory high-noon \u2013 Any hopes in the Boris Johnson camp that there might be a smooth transition to No 10 this week took a drubbing with the promised resignations of the chancellor, Philip Hammond, and the justice secretary, David Gauke. Others opposed to a hard Brexit may follow. Johnson is widely expected to be anointed as the party\u2019s new leader tomorrow (postal ballots from Conservative party members close at 5pm today). He will face a perilous political climate on multiple fronts \u2013 attempts to thwart a no-deal Brexit, a wafter-thin working majority of three that may vanish by the time MPs return from the summer recess, with mooted defections to the Lib Dems coming on top of a predicted byelection defeat. Not to mention the diplomatic tensions with Iran. Theresa May will hold a valedictory PM\u2019s question time tomorrow before Johnson is expected to head to the Palace on Wednesday. Still on politics and the Liberal Democrats will announce their new leader this afternoon to replace Vince Cable. The party\u2019s deputy leader, Jo Swinson, and the former energy secretary, Ed Davey, are both hoping to be elected to the position. * * * \u2018Where were the police?\u2019 \u2013 Hong Kongers have vented their fury over an attack by masked men at a train station, in which commuters, including women and children, were indiscriminately attacked with wooden bats. Dozens were hospitalised and one person was critically injured in the incident, which followed a large anti-government march in the city on Sunday that descended into chaos as police and protesters fought running battles, with riot police firing teargas and rubber bullets. Video showed passengers using umbrellas to shield themselves from the unidentified attackers, who some some suspect of having links to triad gangs. * * * Payback time \u2013 Rail passengers have been urged to seek compensation for every delay they suffer after missing out on an estimated \u00a3100m in payouts last year. Transport Focus, the UK industry watchdog, said passengers should send a message to train operators that reliability must keep improving. \u201cWhen things go wrong train operators must ensure every eligible passenger knows about Delay Repay and how to claim,\u201d said the group\u2019s chief executive, Anthony Smith. Research by the rail industry suggests train operators have been reluctant to advertise passengers\u2019 right to compensation, with 82% of delayed passengers entitled to a payout saying they did not hear any announcement on the train or at the station informing them they could make a claim. * * * Tumble dryer danger \u2013 Whirlpool will today recall an estimated 500,000 machines at risk of bursting into flames, four years after safety concerns in the UK first emerged. The US-owned company issued a safety warning in 2015 after it found its Hotpoint, Creda and Indesit dryers had a fault that could make them catch fire, and launched a programme to modify faulty machines. The government ordered an \u201cunprecedented\u201d recall of the machine recall last month, escalating the long-running controversy. \u201cThe official recall of these machines is welcome but we believe should have been implemented years ago,\u201d said Martyn Allen, the technical director of Electrical Safety First. * * * Weather warning \u2013 The UK will experience a brief heatwave this week, but not before a storm brings torrential rain and strong gales to some areas. The Met office issued a yellow alert for western parts of Scotland for today, with thunderstorms and a risk of flooding. But stand by with the suncream for later in the week when temperatures are expected to hit 34C (93F) across central, southern and eastern areas. \u201cHeatwave thresholds are likely to be reached in some places,\u201d said the office\u2019s chief meteorologist, Andy Page. Today in Focus podcast: Stranded in Pakistan: why did the Home Office deny a baby a visa? Nina Saleh, a British resident for 20 years, travelled to Pakistan to adopt a baby. But she found herself becoming increasingly desperate when the UK Home Office repeatedly denied her visa, leaving her trapped in Pakistan for months on end. And: Zoe Williams on what her time as a waitress taught her about being a good diner. Lunchtime read: Aural sex: erotic podcasts are all about \u2018imagination\u2019 The team at Dipsea, a podcast app that releases erotic sex-positive audio stories, want to challenge people to rethink sexuality \u2013 by processing erotica through their headphones \u2026 and their imagination. \u201cThe truth we hold dear is that sexuality is as psychological as it is physical,\u201d says Gina Gutierrez, one of the ap\u2019s founders. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about stimulation. It\u2019s about imagination. It\u2019s about inspiration.\u201d The project was born over late-night chats and wine. Gutierrez and her co-founder, Faye Keegan, saw a gap in a crowded adult market. Dipsea\u2019s narratives range from former lovers meeting in a chance encounter on the train, to two strangers hitting it off at the same airport gate. The pair felt women were seeking another form of erotica that the market was not delivering. In focus groups, the company has heard from couples listening to the podcasts together and men who are listening to learn, Gutierrez said. \u201cThis is something that can slot into people\u2019s lives pretty easily because it\u2019s so short; it opens up a new possibility of how you can use it,\u201d she says. Sport An emotional Shane Lowry described how he had fought through the bad times, including leaving the Open last year at Carnoustie in tears, to win a brilliant first major championship in Portrush. England beat South Africa to end Tracey Neville\u2019s reign as coach with a bronze medal at the Netball World Cup before New Zealand upset the odds in the final to claim their first crown since 2003, prompting jubilation back home and some soul-searching in the Australian camp. Ellyse Perry scored 76 not out in Australia\u2019s second innings as they drew the Test with England and retained the Women\u2019s Ashes with three T20s left to play. Dina Asher-Smith was given a close-up view of what it will take to become a true sprint champion as she lost the 100m final at the Anniversary Games to Jamaica\u2019s Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce. And Yasser Larouci was stretchered off the pitch following a nasty challenge as Liverpool fell 2-1 to Sevilla during their pre-season friendly in Boston, while Harry Kane labelled his outrageous goal from the halfway line against Juventus in Singapore as \u201cone of the best of my career\u201d. Business High Street lenders have been accused of abandoning some of Britain\u2019s poorest communities with bank branches closing in deprived communities in England four times faster than in wealthy areas. High street banks have collectively closed 990 branches in the most deprived areas of the country since 2010, compared with 230 in the richest local authorities. The digital bank Pockit, which conducted the research, said a quarter of the poorest local authorities had lost more than 40% of their bank branches \u2013 totalling 705 closures \u2013 over an eight-year period.

MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.4%. Brent crude futures were up 1.4% at $63.35 per barrel following a gain of about 0.9% on Friday.

Along its western coast, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce trees topping 60 meters in height have in some cases weathered nearly a millennium of storms.</p> <p>Now a growing chorus of architects, foresters and engineers want the province\u2019s biggest city to grow another cluster of wooden giants: timber skyscrapers.</p> <p>Already, Vancouver\u2019s 18-storey Brock Commons tower stands as a testament to the vast possibilities of wood.

China is changing its code effectively because of Canada.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s another reason Canadian officials think the country could take the lead in transforming the way we build: its vast supply of trees.

Coveted for its strength and richly textured aesthetic appeal, boards of old-growth wood sourced from the primordial forests command top dollar on the open market.</p> <p>More than half of the <a href=\"https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/Mr/Mr112/BC_Forests_Geographical_Snapshot.pdf\">3.2m hectares</a> of old-growth forests in British Columbia are protected lands, but the remaining 1.42m hectares \u2013 home to towering western red cedar, fir and spruce \u2013 still face the prospect of chainsaw blades. The province has so far resisted calls for a moratorium.</p> <p>\u201cWe have an ecological emergency across vast parts of British Columbia,\u201d said Jens Weiting of the Sierra Club. He points to the clear-cutting of old growth forests as a catalyst for increasing fire risk, removing some of the most effective carbon sinks and depleting a resource that takes generations to return.</p> <p>But the large slabs of wood that architects propose for the next generation of towers don\u2019t come from old-growth sanctuaries. Instead, the massive beams and columns are created from the aggregate of many smaller pieces, mimicking many coveted characteristics of old-growth wood \u2013 including strength \u2013 with a fraction of the ecological damage.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raW7j1tUTEI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/raW7j1tUTEI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cA lot of that [old-growth] wood is simply converted into relatively small dimensional lumber, which could easily be replaced by other sources,\u201d said John Innes, dean of forestry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cEngineered wood has provided the opportunity to actually back off the harvesting of old growth.\u201d</p> <p>Both the Ancient Forest Alliance and the Sierra Club of British Columbia told Guardian Cities that, when done in a sustainable manner, the harvesting of younger, second-growth forests represents a way of protecting old growth trees.</p> <p>Despite popular misconceptions of wood as fire-prone and unstable, it can be a robust and innovative building material. Wooden skyscrapers are made of cross-laminated timber (CLT), in which perpendicular strips of wood are glued together to form sturdy beams.

      "bodyText": "British Columbia is no stranger to wooden giants. Along its western coast, Douglas fir and Sitka spruce trees topping 60 meters in height have in some cases weathered nearly a millennium of storms. Now a growing chorus of architects, foresters and engineers want the province\u2019s biggest city to grow another cluster of wooden giants: timber skyscrapers. Already, Vancouver\u2019s 18-storey Brock Commons tower stands as a testament to the vast possibilities of wood. Once the world\u2019s tallest timber building, it was built cheaper, faster and with less environmental impact than a comparable steel and concrete structure would have been \u2013 offsetting an estimated 2,432 metric tonnes of carbon. Now the provincial government has changed its building codes, effectively doubling the height limit for wood-frame buildings to 12 storeys (Brock Commons was granted an exception when it was built). The Canadian government is expected to match BC\u2019s codes nationwide. Vancouver is now pushing even those limits by unveiling plans for the Canada Earth Tower, an ambitious 40-storey tower that would be the world\u2019s tallest wooden building. The design includes around 200 homes, with an outdoor garden for every three floors as well as premium office space and retail. Meanwhile, government figures show nearly 500 mid-rise timber buildings in various stages of completion across the country. \u201c[British Columbia\u2019s] actions have created a ripple effect around the world,\u201d said Michael Green, a Vancouver-based architect and vocal proponent of timber buildings, pointing to recent relaxations in wood building codes in other countries. \u201cThe United States has changed its code effectively because of Canada. China is changing its code effectively because of Canada.\u201d There\u2019s another reason Canadian officials think the country could take the lead in transforming the way we build: its vast supply of trees. Canada has nearly 350 million hectares of forest, with the bulk of harvesting in British Columbia \u2013 where its environmentally conscious design goals have often jarred with the deeply controversial practice of logging old-growth forests. In spite of decades of fierce protest, forestry companies still clear-cut critical forest ecosystems, home to hundred-year-old giants. Coveted for its strength and richly textured aesthetic appeal, boards of old-growth wood sourced from the primordial forests command top dollar on the open market. More than half of the 3.2m hectares of old-growth forests in British Columbia are protected lands, but the remaining 1.42m hectares \u2013 home to towering western red cedar, fir and spruce \u2013 still face the prospect of chainsaw blades. The province has so far resisted calls for a moratorium. \u201cWe have an ecological emergency across vast parts of British Columbia,\u201d said Jens Weiting of the Sierra Club. He points to the clear-cutting of old growth forests as a catalyst for increasing fire risk, removing some of the most effective carbon sinks and depleting a resource that takes generations to return. But the large slabs of wood that architects propose for the next generation of towers don\u2019t come from old-growth sanctuaries. Instead, the massive beams and columns are created from the aggregate of many smaller pieces, mimicking many coveted characteristics of old-growth wood \u2013 including strength \u2013 with a fraction of the ecological damage. \u201cA lot of that [old-growth] wood is simply converted into relatively small dimensional lumber, which could easily be replaced by other sources,\u201d said John Innes, dean of forestry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cEngineered wood has provided the opportunity to actually back off the harvesting of old growth.\u201d Both the Ancient Forest Alliance and the Sierra Club of British Columbia told Guardian Cities that, when done in a sustainable manner, the harvesting of younger, second-growth forests represents a way of protecting old growth trees. Despite popular misconceptions of wood as fire-prone and unstable, it can be a robust and innovative building material. Wooden skyscrapers are made of cross-laminated timber (CLT), in which perpendicular strips of wood are glued together to form sturdy beams. By 2024, Japan\u2019s Sumitomo Group hopes to use CLT to build a 70-storey wood skyscraper in Tokyo, the world\u2019s riskiest city when it comes to earthquakes. Originally a Swiss invention, CLT has been the norm in Europe for decades. Yet years of conservative building regulations in North America have hampered its uses. All of that looks poised to change as Canada leapfrogs European nations by relaxing the rules. The government has also funnelled millions of dollars into research with forestry companies and universities, which are rushing to perfect new techniques and uses for wood. \u201cThis is the first new way of building a skyscraper in a century,\u201d said Green, whose firm recently finished Minneapolis\u2019 T3 building, a seven-storey wood structure, and has proposed designs for other wood towers in Toronto. \u201cIt challenges so many conventions in the construction industry.\u201d Lighter and more efficient to use than other structural materials, engineered wood carries much less of an environmental footprint than concrete, which produces up to 8% of the world\u2019s emissions. The resulting buildings, which often employ exposed wood interiors, are meant to elicit a sense of warmth and joy in visitors, said Jonathan King, a Toronto-based architect. \u201cAs a species, we clamber for places where there are natural materials all around us,\u201d he said. King\u2019s firm broke ground on an eight-storey wood officer tower in June. Meanwhile, on the city\u2019s waterfront, a controversial project led by Sidewalk Labs, a sister company to Google, aims to be \u201cthe first-ever mass timber district in the world\u201d, with some of the planned 12 wooden buildings reaching as high as 35 storeys. Because most of the pieces can be prefabricated, constructing a timber high-rise is like \u201cbuilding with Lego\u201d, said Innes. \u201cTall wood buildings draw attention to the possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when we actually look at what is actually happening\u2014 and where we could utilize the greatest amounts of wood\u2014 it would be in mid-rise buildings.\u201d Indeed, the bulk of new commercial timber buildings projects is focused on mid-to-low rise structures, such as commercial warehouses that currently use mainly concrete and steel, with large amounts of waste. The benefits of using wood, however, could be negated without proper forestry management. Years of intense wildfire and insect blight have constrained timber supplies, said Innes, prompting foresters to ask for regulatory exceptions to harvesting limits. That could harm Canada\u2019s sustainable forestry reputation. \u201cThe truth is, there is no such thing as sustainable building. Everything we do in building includes taking a cost out of something,\u201d said Green. Sustainable management will likely increase costs for forestry companies, builders and taxpayers, but for many in British Columbia, home to giants both past and future, those are costs worth paying.

      "body": "<p>Ricky Wilson gets his greeting a little mixed up when we meet in central London. First, he gives me a full body hug, before announcing he has shingles. \u201cIt\u2019s not that contagious,\u201d he tries to assure me. \u201cYou\u2019d have to literally wear my clothes to catch it.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson suspects he has caught the virus because the band he fronts, Kaiser Chiefs, are about to release their seventh album, Duck. He has had it twice before: \u201cAlways during periods of massive stress.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that anxiety is something <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/ricky-wilson\" title=\"\">Wilson</a> has spent a long time trying to overcome. It tends to rear its head in different ways \u2013 when he first appeared as a guest judge on The Voice, it was in the form of dizziness that was so severe, he couldn\u2019t stand up. \u201cI said to them: \u2018I don\u2019t get anxious, I\u2019m a rock star!\u2019 So they gave me seasick tablets.\u201d</p> <p>Since then, the 41-year-old has tried other ways to tackle it: anti-anxiety medication (\u201cThey left me with no fear of consequences so I stopped\u201d); a brief spell in therapy, before it became too much hassle organising it; and live performance, which he claims sorts him out. But at other times, he says, he turned to alcohol and this is something he wants to address today. However, by the time we have finished a hesitant and occasionally contradictory conversation, I am not entirely convinced he is ready to.</p> <p>I have known Wilson since Kaiser Chiefs found fame in the early 00s as a zippy indie pop group alongside bands such as Arctic Monkeys and Kasabian. Born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, Wilson taught at Leeds College of Art before the band took off. Kaiser Chiefs\u2019 music was more colourful, and less studiedly cool, than some of their peers, and their combination of Britpop nostalgia, Yorkshire humour and catchy tunes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=hamKl-su8PE\" title=\"\">I Predict A Riot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObzgUfCl28\" title=\"\">Ruby</a> \u2013 made them massive.

At the time it seemed like an incredibly risky move \u2013 gambling his hard-earned indie credibility for instant TV fame. But the band had just lost their drummer and songwriter, Nick Hodgson, who had decided he wanted to write for other pop artists instead, and their sales were diminishing. Wilson\u2019s TV sidestep could have been the death knell for the band \u2013 instead, it was a savvy masterstroke. Their next album <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/27/kaiser-chiefs-education-education-education-and-war-review\" title=\"\">Education, Education, Education and War</a> went to No 1. Half a decade later, they are still selling out arenas around the country.</p> <p>\u201cThat was a terrifying time,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI was letting go of control in terms of how people perceive you. Suddenly you\u2019re not in control of the edit. I was just lucky that I didn\u2019t turn out to be an absolute moron, because I didn\u2019t know whether I was or not.\u201d</p> <p>But fame came at some cost. Reading opinions about himself on social media whenever he took his phone out wasn\u2019t ideal for keeping his anxiety levels down. Neither was the fact that Hodgson was no longer around to provide the hits. \u201cI realised that we were just bowling around the world having a right laugh while he took a lot of the weight on his shoulders,\u201d Wilson reflects now. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why he got out.\u201d</p> <p>He says there is no bad blood between them, although they are no longer friends. Did he enjoy proving to Hodgson that the band could be successful without him? \u201cI\u2019m not <em>that</em> vindictive,\u201d he grins. In fact, Wilson loves proving everyone wrong \u2013 even his mortgage adviser Brian. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good friend of mine now, but at the start he told me to expect the band to last no more than five years. And so I proved him wrong \u2026 three times now!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a3bb3e5f0445977cf0956ba0df143b0563b4c0fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3bb3e5f0445977cf0956ba0df143b0563b4c0fb/0_159_4179_2507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson with fellow The Voice judges Sir Tom Jones, Rita Ora and Will.i.am.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson with fellow The Voice judges Sir Tom Jones, Rita Ora and Will.i.am.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Burmiston/BBC/Wall To Wall</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then there are the band\u2019s critics: \u201cThey\u2019ve thrown everything at us and we won\u2019t go away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt annoys them we\u2019re having success ... and I think: \u2018Yeah, it might piss you off but the reason we\u2019re having it is <em>because</em> it\u2019s pissing you off. As soon as you stop noticing, we\u2019ll stop trying.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>For Duck, the band put all their energies into songs they say are more open and personal than before. Lead single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=ulZjajyNjVA\" title=\"\">People Know How to Love One Another</a> has been described in the band\u2019s own publicity material as an anthem for Brexit Britain, although Wilson is cautious about taking this line: \u201cYou should never tell anyone what to do,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a country that\u2019s got 52% people thinking one way and 48% thinking the other way, that\u2019s a way to split your market share.\u201d</p> <p>Elsewhere on the album, Golden Oldies addresses a topic not often dealt with in pop \u2013 male broodiness. (\u201cI can paint the old back bedroom, blue and pink on different sides,\u201d Wilson sings.) \u201cIt\u2019s more about doubting your own broodiness,\u201d says Wilson, who has no children. \u201cBecause you can be broody but then you have to go through with it. And I\u2019ve got enough friends going through it to see that you get both elated and traumatised.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was just lucky that I didn't turn out to be an absolute moron</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He recently said that there was more to life than putting an album out every two years, and that he would rather <a href=\"https://www.universal-music.de/kaiser-chiefs/biografie\" title=\"\">\u201cput out a kid if I can\u201d</a> instead. \u201cWell, at least if you put out a kid you don\u2019t get 20,000 people on Twitter calling you a shithead,\u201d he says.</p> <p>I had assumed that one of the more personal songs on the album was Wait, which explicitly references Wilson\u2019s body insecurity.

But as he often does, Wilson plays it down: \u201cI found it hilarious that all I had to do to get on TV was straighten my teeth and lose a stone,\u201d he says. \u201cThen suddenly I\u2019m in Heat magazine with a before-and-after photograph saying I\u2019m a heart-throb.\u201d</p> <p>The way Wilson tells it, he had struggled to find a route on to TV until his dentist told him about a new brace that could sort his teeth out for \u00a31,500. \u201cI was umming and ahhing about it and my girlfriend at the time said: \u2018Of course you should, you\u2019re supposed to be a pop star!\u2019 And there I was thinking maybe we needed a new fridge.

So now when I feel anxious, I try to imagine that I\u2019m just excited instead, and \u2026 it doesn\u2019t help that much.\u201d He laughs, but it sounds like strange advice from a professional \u2013 sometimes, I suggest, anxiety exists because of a painful incident. \u201cUncertainty as well,\u201d he says. \u201cI get anxious when I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So throwing yourself into any kind of abyss, whether it\u2019s splitting up with someone or leaving a band, is just \u2026\u201d</p> <p>He trails off, looks uncomfortable and changes the topic. \u201cMy body language is bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, noticing that he has slumped in his seat with his arms folded. Would he rather we didn\u2019t cover this? \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Sometimes the only way you get to find things out is by doing interviews \u2026 free therapy!\u201d</p> <p>We move on to how he would drink to cope with the anxiety, and how that could sometimes get on top of him when he was on the road. \u201cBecause it\u2019s always available and legal. Plus people really like to see you \u2013 the guy who was on stage \u2013 afterwards. And they like to see you drinking \u2026 so I would get drunk. It becomes a weird hobby to take your mind off everything else. I\u2019d be, like, I\u2019m away for three weeks, I\u2019ll get through this by not really noticing. And as long as I can do my job properly, everything will be all right.\u201d</p> <p>He mentions the strange dynamic of touring, where being a lead singer means that you\u2019re \u201cat the top of a pyramid of people, and so you can kind of get away with a lot as long as it doesn\u2019t seep through into your work\u201d. Yet at the same time, being at the top of the pyramid brings its own pressures: \u201cI have loads of people who I have to take on tour. If I don\u2019t go, no one goes.\u201d</p> <p>How bad was the drinking? \u201cOn a personal level, I think it was bad,\u201d he says. \u201cEnough to want to stop. But in the grand music industry scheme of things? I think I drank less than most people spilled.\u201d</p> <p>He says he was never dependent on alcohol. \u201cI was more dependent on finding ways to do it than I was doing it. I liked the game of it. I liked the fact that it was something I\u2019d plan. I was quite sneaky and I got sneakier. The fun was in hiding it.\u201d</p> <p>Why was he hiding it? \u201cBecause I was ashamed,\u201d he says. And suddenly he sounds it, too, so much that I wonder if we should really be talking about this at all \u2013 yet he insists he is happy to carry on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85c77f1c15b58189e9c070cb7d1b790c99d08365\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85c77f1c15b58189e9c070cb7d1b790c99d08365/0_236_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wilson on stage with Kaiser Chiefs in Glasgow in June.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wilson on stage with Kaiser Chiefs in Glasgow in June.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Ricciuti/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI sound like I\u2019m skirting around the issue but I\u2019m still a little bit embarrassed,\u201d he says, biting his lip. \u201cSo it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to talk about it \u2026 it\u2019s more that I don\u2019t know <em>how</em> to talk about it.\u201d</p> <p>He describes quitting drinking as \u201ca new hobby\u201d, which sounds as if he\u2019s being flippant again.

      "bodyText": "Ricky Wilson gets his greeting a little mixed up when we meet in central London. First, he gives me a full body hug, before announcing he has shingles. \u201cIt\u2019s not that contagious,\u201d he tries to assure me. \u201cYou\u2019d have to literally wear my clothes to catch it.\u201d Wilson suspects he has caught the virus because the band he fronts, Kaiser Chiefs, are about to release their seventh album, Duck. He has had it twice before: \u201cAlways during periods of massive stress.\u201d It turns out that anxiety is something Wilson has spent a long time trying to overcome. It tends to rear its head in different ways \u2013 when he first appeared as a guest judge on The Voice, it was in the form of dizziness that was so severe, he couldn\u2019t stand up. \u201cI said to them: \u2018I don\u2019t get anxious, I\u2019m a rock star!\u2019 So they gave me seasick tablets.\u201d Since then, the 41-year-old has tried other ways to tackle it: anti-anxiety medication (\u201cThey left me with no fear of consequences so I stopped\u201d); a brief spell in therapy, before it became too much hassle organising it; and live performance, which he claims sorts him out. But at other times, he says, he turned to alcohol and this is something he wants to address today. However, by the time we have finished a hesitant and occasionally contradictory conversation, I am not entirely convinced he is ready to. I have known Wilson since Kaiser Chiefs found fame in the early 00s as a zippy indie pop group alongside bands such as Arctic Monkeys and Kasabian. Born in Keighley, West Yorkshire, Wilson taught at Leeds College of Art before the band took off. Kaiser Chiefs\u2019 music was more colourful, and less studiedly cool, than some of their peers, and their combination of Britpop nostalgia, Yorkshire humour and catchy tunes \u2013 I Predict A Riot, Ruby \u2013 made them massive. Their 2005 debut album Employment went platinum six times in the UK. The last time we met was in 2014, at the Groucho Club in Soho, just as Wilson was preparing for his new role as a judge on The Voice. At the time it seemed like an incredibly risky move \u2013 gambling his hard-earned indie credibility for instant TV fame. But the band had just lost their drummer and songwriter, Nick Hodgson, who had decided he wanted to write for other pop artists instead, and their sales were diminishing. Wilson\u2019s TV sidestep could have been the death knell for the band \u2013 instead, it was a savvy masterstroke. Their next album Education, Education, Education and War went to No 1. Half a decade later, they are still selling out arenas around the country. \u201cThat was a terrifying time,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI was letting go of control in terms of how people perceive you. Suddenly you\u2019re not in control of the edit. I was just lucky that I didn\u2019t turn out to be an absolute moron, because I didn\u2019t know whether I was or not.\u201d But fame came at some cost. Reading opinions about himself on social media whenever he took his phone out wasn\u2019t ideal for keeping his anxiety levels down. Neither was the fact that Hodgson was no longer around to provide the hits. \u201cI realised that we were just bowling around the world having a right laugh while he took a lot of the weight on his shoulders,\u201d Wilson reflects now. \u201cIt\u2019s probably why he got out.\u201d He says there is no bad blood between them, although they are no longer friends. Did he enjoy proving to Hodgson that the band could be successful without him? \u201cI\u2019m not that vindictive,\u201d he grins. In fact, Wilson loves proving everyone wrong \u2013 even his mortgage adviser Brian. \u201cHe\u2019s a very good friend of mine now, but at the start he told me to expect the band to last no more than five years. And so I proved him wrong \u2026 three times now!\u201d Then there are the band\u2019s critics: \u201cThey\u2019ve thrown everything at us and we won\u2019t go away,\u201d he says. \u201cIt annoys them we\u2019re having success ... and I think: \u2018Yeah, it might piss you off but the reason we\u2019re having it is because it\u2019s pissing you off. As soon as you stop noticing, we\u2019ll stop trying.\u2019\u201d For Duck, the band put all their energies into songs they say are more open and personal than before. Lead single People Know How to Love One Another has been described in the band\u2019s own publicity material as an anthem for Brexit Britain, although Wilson is cautious about taking this line: \u201cYou should never tell anyone what to do,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a country that\u2019s got 52% people thinking one way and 48% thinking the other way, that\u2019s a way to split your market share.\u201d Elsewhere on the album, Golden Oldies addresses a topic not often dealt with in pop \u2013 male broodiness. (\u201cI can paint the old back bedroom, blue and pink on different sides,\u201d Wilson sings.) \u201cIt\u2019s more about doubting your own broodiness,\u201d says Wilson, who has no children. \u201cBecause you can be broody but then you have to go through with it. And I\u2019ve got enough friends going through it to see that you get both elated and traumatised.\u201d He recently said that there was more to life than putting an album out every two years, and that he would rather \u201cput out a kid if I can\u201d instead. \u201cWell, at least if you put out a kid you don\u2019t get 20,000 people on Twitter calling you a shithead,\u201d he says. I had assumed that one of the more personal songs on the album was Wait, which explicitly references Wilson\u2019s body insecurity. Even though it is wrapped up in typical Kaiser humour (\u201cI\u2019ve got 99 problems, and every one of them with a flake\u201d), it seems to be touching on something more serious with its talk of mirror glances and skipping meals. But as he often does, Wilson plays it down: \u201cI found it hilarious that all I had to do to get on TV was straighten my teeth and lose a stone,\u201d he says. \u201cThen suddenly I\u2019m in Heat magazine with a before-and-after photograph saying I\u2019m a heart-throb.\u201d The way Wilson tells it, he had struggled to find a route on to TV until his dentist told him about a new brace that could sort his teeth out for \u00a31,500. \u201cI was umming and ahhing about it and my girlfriend at the time said: \u2018Of course you should, you\u2019re supposed to be a pop star!\u2019 And there I was thinking maybe we needed a new fridge. But it turned out to be a good investment.\u201d Wilson is often amusing but it can be hard to pierce through the wisecracks to work out how he really feels. This is particularly difficult when it comes to his anxiety: one minute he appears to be wrestling with his demons, the next he is laughing it all off. \u201cI can leave the house in the morning, I\u2019m fine,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve got money in the bank and a support system around me. So I have anxiety, but I don\u2019t suffer from it.\u201d He says a doctor once told him that anxiety was just adults not being able to process excitement. \u201cKids get excited; adults get anxious. So now when I feel anxious, I try to imagine that I\u2019m just excited instead, and \u2026 it doesn\u2019t help that much.\u201d He laughs, but it sounds like strange advice from a professional \u2013 sometimes, I suggest, anxiety exists because of a painful incident. \u201cUncertainty as well,\u201d he says. \u201cI get anxious when I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. So throwing yourself into any kind of abyss, whether it\u2019s splitting up with someone or leaving a band, is just \u2026\u201d He trails off, looks uncomfortable and changes the topic. \u201cMy body language is bad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, noticing that he has slumped in his seat with his arms folded. Would he rather we didn\u2019t cover this? \u201cNo, it\u2019s fine,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting. Sometimes the only way you get to find things out is by doing interviews \u2026 free therapy!\u201d We move on to how he would drink to cope with the anxiety, and how that could sometimes get on top of him when he was on the road. \u201cBecause it\u2019s always available and legal.

      "body": "<p>For the team at Dipsea, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/todayinfocus\">podcast</a> app that releases erotic sex-positive audio stories, the crucial piece in any of their shorts is the listener\u2019s imagination.</p> <p>In a world where so much of readily available pornography is visual, Dipsea is challenging its subscribers to rethink sexuality. By processing erotica through their headphones, listeners are \u201cenvisioning something based on the blueprint that we give them\u201d, Gina Gutierrez, one of Dipsea\u2019s founders, said.</p> <p>\u201cThe truth we hold dear is that sexuality is as psychological as it is physical,\u201d Gutierrez continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about stimulation. It\u2019s about imagination. It\u2019s about inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>Dipsea began, like many of its stories, over late-night chats and wine. Gutierrez and her co-founder, Faye Keegan, would sit around their friends\u2019 kitchen tables in San Francisco, talking about Keegan\u2019s affinity for the Starz series Outlander and its many sexy scenes.</p> <p>\u201cThat kind of experience is many women\u2019s stand-in for erotic content,\u201d Gutierrez said. <em>\u201c</em>They\u2019re not watching it to get off, they\u2019re not watching it to get turned on, but then they eventually are because it\u2019s really good, erotic content.\u201d</p> <p>When Gutierrez and Keegan first started exploring the concept of the app, they found a gap in the market. There were romance novels, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/04/fifty-shades-of-white-romance-novels-racism-ritas-rwa\">a $1bn-a-year industry in the US</a>, but those require time and commitment in a way that a visit to PornHub does not. There is online written erotica and even online audio erotica, but much of it is user-generated and of variable quality.</p> <p>They knew that in this day and age, plenty of women do find satisfaction in the available erotic content out there, whether it be visual or the written word. But they also felt many women were seeking another form of erotica that the market just hadn\u2019t yet developed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/24/i-wanted-sex-on-my-terms-and-it-was-readers-on-the-joy-of-losing-your-virginity-in-your-30s\">'I wanted sex on my terms, and it was': readers on the joy of losing your virginity in your 30s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThen one night, I was listening to the Headspace podcast and thought, this is what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s super sensory, it makes you feel something, you feel better after you listen.

      "bodyText": "For the team at Dipsea, a podcast app that releases erotic sex-positive audio stories, the crucial piece in any of their shorts is the listener\u2019s imagination. In a world where so much of readily available pornography is visual, Dipsea is challenging its subscribers to rethink sexuality. By processing erotica through their headphones, listeners are \u201cenvisioning something based on the blueprint that we give them\u201d, Gina Gutierrez, one of Dipsea\u2019s founders, said. \u201cThe truth we hold dear is that sexuality is as psychological as it is physical,\u201d Gutierrez continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about stimulation. It\u2019s about imagination. It\u2019s about inspiration.\u201d Dipsea began, like many of its stories, over late-night chats and wine. Gutierrez and her co-founder, Faye Keegan, would sit around their friends\u2019 kitchen tables in San Francisco, talking about Keegan\u2019s affinity for the Starz series Outlander and its many sexy scenes. \u201cThat kind of experience is many women\u2019s stand-in for erotic content,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cThey\u2019re not watching it to get off, they\u2019re not watching it to get turned on, but then they eventually are because it\u2019s really good, erotic content.\u201d When Gutierrez and Keegan first started exploring the concept of the app, they found a gap in the market. There were romance novels, a $1bn-a-year industry in the US, but those require time and commitment in a way that a visit to PornHub does not. There is online written erotica and even online audio erotica, but much of it is user-generated and of variable quality. They knew that in this day and age, plenty of women do find satisfaction in the available erotic content out there, whether it be visual or the written word. But they also felt many women were seeking another form of erotica that the market just hadn\u2019t yet developed. \u201cThen one night, I was listening to the Headspace podcast and thought, this is what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cIt\u2019s super sensory, it makes you feel something, you feel better after you listen. It\u2019s not just about the listening \u2013 it\u2019s about what happens afterwards. You feel relaxed, you feel more connected to your body.\u201d Dipsea launched in December, part of a booming podcast industry. Globally, 287 million people listened to at least one podcast a month in 2016, a figure that is expected to grow to 1.85 billion by 2023, according to the research company Ovum. Global podcast advertising revenue had reached $490m by the end of 2017, with the market predicted to hit $1bn by the end of 2020. With a podcast for any interest, be it dentistry or women drinking wine and talking about murder, sex has found a home in the medium as well. Bawdy Storytelling features true stories about sex, while the sex-advice columnist Dan Savage answers sex and relationship questions on Savage Lovecast. Few have gone the route of Dipsea, however, in generating regular original fictional content, produced with voice actors. \u201cIn a way, audio is a retro medium,\u201d Gutierrez said. \u201cWhen podcasting started blowing up, a lot of people were like, what?

This week it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/17/netflix-shares-fall-misses-growth-targets\">announced</a> that it had lost 130,000 US subscribers \u2013 its first drop in several years \u2013 while only achieving half of its global growth forecast. And worse is to come. A rush of new streaming services is in the process of stripping Netflix of its library. Friends is going to HBO Max. The Office is going to NBCUniversal. Disney+ could snatch back anything by Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm or 20th Century Fox. If Netflix is going to remain a world leader in streaming television, it needs all the original hits it can get.</p> <p>And right now Stranger Things is the biggest hit it has. Four days after its launch, Netflix <a href=\"https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1148359444188712960\">tweeted</a> about the record-breaking number of viewers who\u2019d either watched or completed Stranger Things 3. Furthermore, a recent survey discovered that Stranger Things was the second most beloved show on Netflix, after the soon-to-end Orange Is the New Black, even outscoring Friends.</p> <p>So Stranger Things isn\u2019t going anywhere. But what does the future hold? Here\u2019s a timescale of educated guesses.</p> <p>First, and most inevitably, let\u2019s not kid ourselves that Hopper is dead. Sure, it might have looked to all the world like he died at the end of Stranger Things 3, but then came the post-credit sting with all the pointed talk of \u201cthe American\u201d. Also, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that David Harbour is still under contract to the show. Plus, you know, the way that he\u2019s still talking about things that Hopper will do in the future, like when he told <a href=\"https://www.slashfilm.com/stranger-things-3-post-credit-scene/\">Slashfilm</a> that Hopper has karmic debts to pay for how dead he\u2019s been for a long time\u201d. So Hopper will be back. <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/netflix-stranger-things-smoking-cigarettes_n_5d1faa61e4b04c481413dd4c\">He won\u2019t smoke as much</a>, but he\u2019ll be back.</p> <p>Paul Reiser might also make a return. In Stranger Things 2, he fulfilled the Mandatory Older Actor From The 1980s role that\u2019s been filled by Cary Elwes and Matthew Modine in other seasons, but he returned by helicopter for a stunned-looking cameo in the aftermath of The Battle of Starcourt. This could mean that his character \u2013 a high-ranking scientist specialising in The Upside Down \u2013 is due to play a bigger part next year.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"590f8236af72355bafe49db3c23bc196ca045b30\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/590f8236af72355bafe49db3c23bc196ca045b30/0_0_4000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"undefined\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>And Eleven will regain her powers. She lost them towards the end of Stranger Things 3, presumably to give someone else a chance at being the hero. But will they come back? MilliComine Bobby Brown has teased that they might not, telling <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/07/06/stranger-things-3-millie-bobby-brown/\">Entertainment Weekly</a> that \u201cEleven is powerful with and without powers\u201d. And that might be true, but she\u2019d also be boring without them. Her powers are the only thing stopping her from becoming a sentient promotional tool for Eggo. Maybe her awful friends from that terrible bottle episode in season two can come and help her. Wouldn\u2019t that be a treat?</p> <p>Hawkins is also likely to be less of a fixture. Joyce and her grab-bag family have all moved away \u2013 much, much later than they should have, given everything that happened in season one \u2013 and Hopper is probably in a Russian cell somewhere. According to Matt Duffer, who spoke to <a href=\"https://ew.com/tv/2019/07/09/stranger-things-4-the-duffer-brothers-tease/\">Entertainment Weekly</a> last week, \u201cI think the biggest thing that\u2019s going to happen is it\u2019s going to open up a little bit, not necessarily in terms of scale, in terms of special effects, but open up in terms of allowing plotlines into areas outside of Hawkins.\u201d But then again, the brothers also told <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/07/stranger-things-3-ending-hopper-death-duffer-brothers-interview-season-4\">Vanity Fair</a> that \u201cThe story of Hawkins is not quite finished!\u201d So maybe everyone will be brought back to Hawkins by some sort of Upside Downy event, but that probably won\u2019t happen immediately.</p> <p>Beyond that, who knows. My guess is that the Duffer Brothers will end their story and Netflix will be desperate for them to stay, so they\u2019ll revert back to their original plan to Make Stranger Things an anthology series, and tell a completely different tale under the Stranger Things banner. And then obviously that will be a failure, so the Duffers will bring back the original cast \u2013 by that point in various states of post-child star disrepair \u2013 for a sloppy and directionless reunion season. And then two years after that, Disney will buy Netflix, leading to a new Stranger Things series where a number of lower-tier Avengers will travel to the Upside Down to punch a Demogorgon in the face. Memorise this last paragraph, because it will definitely come true.</p>",

Disney+ could snatch back anything by Disney, Marvel, Lucasfilm or 20th Century Fox. If Netflix is going to remain a world leader in streaming television, it needs all the original hits it can get. And right now Stranger Things is the biggest hit it has. Four days after its launch, Netflix tweeted about the record-breaking number of viewers who\u2019d either watched or completed Stranger Things 3. Furthermore, a recent survey discovered that Stranger Things was the second most beloved show on Netflix, after the soon-to-end Orange Is the New Black, even outscoring Friends. So Stranger Things isn\u2019t going anywhere. But what does the future hold? Here\u2019s a timescale of educated guesses. First, and most inevitably, let\u2019s not kid ourselves that Hopper is dead. Sure, it might have looked to all the world like he died at the end of Stranger Things 3, but then came the post-credit sting with all the pointed talk of \u201cthe American\u201d. Also, it\u2019s hard to ignore the fact that David Harbour is still under contract to the show. Plus, you know, the way that he\u2019s still talking about things that Hopper will do in the future, like when he told Slashfilm that Hopper has karmic debts to pay for how dead he\u2019s been for a long time\u201d. So Hopper will be back. He won\u2019t smoke as much, but he\u2019ll be back. Paul Reiser might also make a return. In Stranger Things 2, he fulfilled the Mandatory Older Actor From The 1980s role that\u2019s been filled by Cary Elwes and Matthew Modine in other seasons, but he returned by helicopter for a stunned-looking cameo in the aftermath of The Battle of Starcourt. This could mean that his character \u2013 a high-ranking scientist specialising in The Upside Down \u2013 is due to play a bigger part next year. And Eleven will regain her powers. She lost them towards the end of Stranger Things 3, presumably to give someone else a chance at being the hero. But will they come back? MilliComine Bobby Brown has teased that they might not, telling Entertainment Weekly that \u201cEleven is powerful with and without powers\u201d. And that might be true, but she\u2019d also be boring without them. Her powers are the only thing stopping her from becoming a sentient promotional tool for Eggo. Maybe her awful friends from that terrible bottle episode in season two can come and help her. Wouldn\u2019t that be a treat? Hawkins is also likely to be less of a fixture. Joyce and her grab-bag family have all moved away \u2013 much, much later than they should have, given everything that happened in season one \u2013 and Hopper is probably in a Russian cell somewhere. According to Matt Duffer, who spoke to Entertainment Weekly last week, \u201cI think the biggest thing that\u2019s going to happen is it\u2019s going to open up a little bit, not necessarily in terms of scale, in terms of special effects, but open up in terms of allowing plotlines into areas outside of Hawkins.\u201d But then again, the brothers also told Vanity Fair that \u201cThe story of Hawkins is not quite finished!\u201d So maybe everyone will be brought back to Hawkins by some sort of Upside Downy event, but that probably won\u2019t happen immediately. Beyond that, who knows. My guess is that the Duffer Brothers will end their story and Netflix will be desperate for them to stay, so they\u2019ll revert back to their original plan to Make Stranger Things an anthology series, and tell a completely different tale under the Stranger Things banner. And then obviously that will be a failure, so the Duffers will bring back the original cast \u2013 by that point in various states of post-child star disrepair \u2013 for a sloppy and directionless reunion season. And then two years after that, Disney will buy Netflix, leading to a new Stranger Things series where a number of lower-tier Avengers will travel to the Upside Down to punch a Demogorgon in the face. Memorise this last paragraph, because it will definitely come true.",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s something of the Renaissance man about Fred Brathwaite, AKA Fab 5 Freddy. A graffiti artist turned film-maker, producer and curator, Brathwaite spent much of the 80s speeding from downtown to uptown New York, connecting the punk scene with hip-hop DJs and graffiti crews like his Fabulous Five. He worked with everyone from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/basquiat\">Jean-Michel Basquiat</a> to <a href=\"https://nasirjones.com/\">Nas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/blondie\">Blondie</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/clash\">the Clash</a>. With his signature Kangol hat and oval shades, he became a torchbearer for hip-hop in the late 80s and early 90s, fronting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/mtv\">MTV</a>\u2019s flagship rap show and conducting formative interviews with a <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pl9-ljAa1U\">fresh-faced Tupac</a> and a typically spaced-out <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sXllZxwas1A\">Tribe Called Quest</a>.</p> <p>Upgrading the Kangol for a fedora and the shades for thick-rimmed reading glasses, Brathwaite now has the calmly authoritative air of an elder statesman. So much so that he has moved into Alan Yentob territory, making a film for the BBC about the hidden representations of black figures in Italian Renaissance art, under the painfully alliterative title A Fresh Guide to Florence with Fab 5 Freddy. He even opens the show on horseback, trotting outside <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2009/sep/01/uffizi-museum-florence\">the Uffizi</a> like a feudal lord. Where other hip-hop luminaries like Wu Tang Clan have their obsessions with shaolin kung fu, OutKast with aliens and MF Doom with comic-book villains, it seems Braithwaite\u2019s cultural touchstones are rather more academic.</p> <p>While his show is serious, Brathwaite is on terrific form when he turns his hip-hop-referencing gaze on to art history. Machiavelli is \u201cTupac\u2019s guy\u201d, Michelangelo is \u201cthe Michael Jackson of the Renaissance\u201d, as well as being a \u201cstreet artist\u201d for his wall drawings in the Medici tombs. And he revels in the controversy of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Urbino\">Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino</a>, which almost saw the artist excommunicated for its eroticised nudity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"efd12b1636886709be7982ec779d9a458c00f564\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/efd12b1636886709be7982ec779d9a458c00f564/51_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Eroticism controversy \u2026 Braithwaite and Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eroticism controversy \u2026 Brathwaite and Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC Studios</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The roots of his fascination run deep. \u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d he says, \u201cI would cut school to travel around Manhattan museums.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2014/may/26/new-york-metropolitan-museum-art-met-renovations\">The Metropolitan</a> was his favourite because of its lax entry policy. \u201cI would show up and toss a nickel in the admissions box then spend a day in fantasy land, going from English armour to Renaissance paintings, pop art to expressionism.\u201d </p> <p>It was an unusual interest, not one he could share with \u201cthe kids on the corner from the hood\u201d. But it sparked his own artistic career as a subway graffiti artist and led to a lasting bond with Basquiat, who he met as a teenager. \u201cHe would spend a lot of his childhood at the Brooklyn Museum just as I did at the Met,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, there was someone I could talk to about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/caravaggio\">Caravaggio</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/rothko\">Rothko</a>. We were both so impressed with the radical nature of modernist manifestos like futurism. They gave us \u2013 two young, black kids \u2013 the capacity to articulate what we wanted to say.\u201d</p> <p>He thought a lot about Basquiat while making this film. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he ever went to Florence but he would have absolutely loved it. The fact that the works are shown where they\u2019re intended to be, in their basilicas, would have been very important to him. He cared a lot about how his work was shown.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a7d1c6e7798c5b3b457fd3db1a6a015d3e57ecba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7d1c6e7798c5b3b457fd3db1a6a015d3e57ecba/0_74_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018They just thought we were grimy criminal kids\u2019 \u2026 Braithwaite in front of a work by Lee Qui\u00f1ones in Harlem, 1979.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018They just thought we were grimy criminal kids\u2019 \u2026 Brathwaite in front of a work by Lee Qui\u00f1ones in Harlem, 1979.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deborah Feingold/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This need to control the narrative around creativity was a result of the racial restraints of the 80s, which also affected Braithwaite. \u201cGallery people would be shocked that I knew who people like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Reinhardt\">Ad Reinhardt</a> were,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t expect a black kid from Brooklyn to be into these things. Nobody was writing or saying anything positive about the graffiti we were doing. They just thought we were grimy criminal kids. So that\u2019s why I made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084904/\">Wild Style</a>.\u201d This was his 1982 film about a fictional graffiti artist from the Bronx called Zoro. \u201cWe had to take control and show graffiti to the world. We made it street art and we\u2019ve given you <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/banksy\">Banksy</a> now.\u201d</p> <p>Wild Style, directed by Charlie Ahearn, has since become a cult classic in documenting the genesis of hip-hop. The first film to weave together the threads of record-scratching, MCs, graffiti art and breakdancing, it gave a sense of the movement in its entirety, featuring such prominent figures as subway graffiti artist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Qui%C3%B1ones\">Lee Qui\u00f1ones</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/aug/07/the-get-down-baz-luhrmann-grandmaster-flash-hip-hop\">DJ Grandmaster Flash</a> and Brathwaite himself. \u201cHip-hop falls in the lineage of the great artistic revolutions of history,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have any patronage or financial backing.

      "bodyText": "There\u2019s something of the Renaissance man about Fred Brathwaite, AKA Fab 5 Freddy. A graffiti artist turned film-maker, producer and curator, Brathwaite spent much of the 80s speeding from downtown to uptown New York, connecting the punk scene with hip-hop DJs and graffiti crews like his Fabulous Five. He worked with everyone from Jean-Michel Basquiat to Nas, Blondie and the Clash. With his signature Kangol hat and oval shades, he became a torchbearer for hip-hop in the late 80s and early 90s, fronting MTV\u2019s flagship rap show and conducting formative interviews with a fresh-faced Tupac and a typically spaced-out Tribe Called Quest. Upgrading the Kangol for a fedora and the shades for thick-rimmed reading glasses, Brathwaite now has the calmly authoritative air of an elder statesman. So much so that he has moved into Alan Yentob territory, making a film for the BBC about the hidden representations of black figures in Italian Renaissance art, under the painfully alliterative title A Fresh Guide to Florence with Fab 5 Freddy. He even opens the show on horseback, trotting outside the Uffizi like a feudal lord. Where other hip-hop luminaries like Wu Tang Clan have their obsessions with shaolin kung fu, OutKast with aliens and MF Doom with comic-book villains, it seems Braithwaite\u2019s cultural touchstones are rather more academic. While his show is serious, Brathwaite is on terrific form when he turns his hip-hop-referencing gaze on to art history. Machiavelli is \u201cTupac\u2019s guy\u201d, Michelangelo is \u201cthe Michael Jackson of the Renaissance\u201d, as well as being a \u201cstreet artist\u201d for his wall drawings in the Medici tombs. And he revels in the controversy of Titian\u2019s Venus of Urbino, which almost saw the artist excommunicated for its eroticised nudity. The roots of his fascination run deep. \u201cWhen I was a kid,\u201d he says, \u201cI would cut school to travel around Manhattan museums.\u201d The Metropolitan was his favourite because of its lax entry policy. \u201cI would show up and toss a nickel in the admissions box then spend a day in fantasy land, going from English armour to Renaissance paintings, pop art to expressionism.\u201d It was an unusual interest, not one he could share with \u201cthe kids on the corner from the hood\u201d. But it sparked his own artistic career as a subway graffiti artist and led to a lasting bond with Basquiat, who he met as a teenager. \u201cHe would spend a lot of his childhood at the Brooklyn Museum just as I did at the Met,\u201d he says. \u201cFinally, there was someone I could talk to about Caravaggio and Rothko. We were both so impressed with the radical nature of modernist manifestos like futurism. They gave us \u2013 two young, black kids \u2013 the capacity to articulate what we wanted to say.\u201d He thought a lot about Basquiat while making this film. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he ever went to Florence but he would have absolutely loved it. The fact that the works are shown where they\u2019re intended to be, in their basilicas, would have been very important to him. He cared a lot about how his work was shown.\u201d This need to control the narrative around creativity was a result of the racial restraints of the 80s, which also affected Braithwaite. \u201cGallery people would be shocked that I knew who people like Ad Reinhardt were,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t expect a black kid from Brooklyn to be into these things. Nobody was writing or saying anything positive about the graffiti we were doing. They just thought we were grimy criminal kids. So that\u2019s why I made Wild Style.\u201d This was his 1982 film about a fictional graffiti artist from the Bronx called Zoro. \u201cWe had to take control and show graffiti to the world. We made it street art and we\u2019ve given you Banksy now.\u201d Wild Style, directed by Charlie Ahearn, has since become a cult classic in documenting the genesis of hip-hop. The first film to weave together the threads of record-scratching, MCs, graffiti art and breakdancing, it gave a sense of the movement in its entirety, featuring such prominent figures as subway graffiti artist Lee Qui\u00f1ones, DJ Grandmaster Flash and Brathwaite himself. \u201cHip-hop falls in the lineage of the great artistic revolutions of history,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t have any patronage or financial backing. From the Harlem Renaissance to our scene, we just went out and did it.\u201d The message took time to spread, though. It wasn\u2019t until the early 90s and the arrival of NWA, Tupac and the Notorious BIG that hip-hop went global. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s race that held us back,\u201d Brathwaite says. \u201cThere was a movement of radical creatives in New York and they were all outsiders. But we were so outside we were almost locked out.\u201d In his new film, Brathwaite looks back to the Italian Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries when, he believes, racial stereotypes were not as prevalent. He references such works as Carpaccio\u2019s Miracle of the Relic of the True Cross on the Rialto Bridge, with its realist depiction of an elegantly dressed black gondolier in the foreground, citing it as an example of Italian metropolitan multiculturalism. \u201cWhat was interesting was that before the African slave trade began, the concept of race didn\u2019t really exist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe depictions of African people weren\u2019t stereotyped.

I remember thinking, \u2018You\u2019re an ignorant racist if you think he\u2019s some wild man that they pulled off the streets and locked up in the basement and gave some paints to.\u2019\u201d Brathwaite sees the mid-17th century tomb of Doge Giovanni Pesaro \u2013 a gargantuan marble monument held up by sculpted depictions of four grimacing slaves \u2013 as a turning point. \u201cThat made me sick to my stomach,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was visceral to see how these black figures were carved and then to know that this is how black people would continue to be represented after the African slave trade started. Before it began, slavery wasn\u2019t as brutal \u2013 it would be conquered people following their conqueror\u2019s religion and language.

      "body": "<p>This week\u2019s nightmare is the arrival of Boris Johnson; the autumn brings the Brexit watershed. Soon after, the 2020 US election takes shape, compounding the sense that politics everywhere is in a state of complete unpredictability. All that is clear, perhaps, is that the forces gathered around Brexit, Donald Trump and the various brands of European populism still think things are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/the-new-populism\" title=\"\">going their way</a>.</p> <p>For some people, everything comes down to the failures of neoliberalism and its inbuilt globalisation, and the long aftershocks from the crash of 2008.

There are also people who seem to think that any sober, cause-and-effect explanations of a global crisis are impossible amid the mess: they tend to take refuge in rather specious ideas about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/16/britain-national-nervous-breakdown-internet-social-media\" title=\"\">collective derangement</a>\u201d and national nervous breakdowns.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The ongoing transformation of production and consumption by computing power is everywhere</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What is not mentioned nearly enough is actually plain to see. We live in a time of deep economic disruption. The ongoing transformation of production and consumption by computing power is everywhere: in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2019/jan/30/high-street-crisis-town-centres-lose-8-of-shops-in-five-years\" title=\"\">hollowed-out town and city centres</a> and a labour market that seems to be increasingly divided between tech-literate, university-educated people at the top, and those pushed down into work that is service-based, insecure and poorly paid. Digital innovation is not separate from but integral to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/trump-workers-jobs-overseas-factories\" title=\"\">off</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/trump-workers-jobs-overseas-factories\" title=\"\">shoring of jobs</a>: technology allows companies to oversee production from a distance, and coordinate massively complicated modern supply chains. These things form the basic facts of our age, and a lot of political phenomena have to be understood accordingly.</p> <p>This is the basic argument of a book I have been lost in for the last 10 days: <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f1b84f22-a25b-11e9-974c-ad1c6ab5efd1\" title=\"\">The Technology Trap</a>, by the Swedish-German economist and historian Carl Benedikt Frey. His basic thesis is that this phase of the 21st century is turning out to be very like the early 19th, in the sense that technology is causing a great crisis of status, security and trust in institutions. Back then, the <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/there-is-a-light-that-never-goes-out\" title=\"\">stereotypical dissenter</a> was a skilled weaver in a newly industrialising area of England, horrified by the arrival of mechanised mills and rightly fearing a collapse in esteem and earnings. Now, a global storm centres on similarly angry people \u2013 men, very often \u2013 in such US states as Ohio. \u201cNot every manufacturing town there voted for Trump,\u201d Frey writes. \u201cBut electoral districts specialising in industries that have invested heavily in automation overwhelmingly did.\u201d</p> <p>He points out that in these places, a whole swath of the old socioeconomic middle, encompassing everyone from machine operators to mortgage underwriters, has been shrinking away for at least three decades \u2013 and to lose a once secure job in these circumstances is to surrender any chance of comparable stability. Nonetheless, many people affected by such experiences have an enduring personal investment in an idea Frey terms the \u201cdisciplined self\u201d: an idea invented as a means of \u201ctaking pride in monotonous toil on a factory\u2019s assembly line\u201d, bolstering the self-worth of male breadwinners.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"131e1f3b320a682a7cdbbce9a40fb957143666c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/131e1f3b320a682a7cdbbce9a40fb957143666c1/0_144_3352_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Hardworking Americans.\u2019 US president-elect Donald Trump visits a factory in Indianapolis, 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Hardworking Americans.\u2019 US president-elect Donald Trump visits a factory in Indianapolis, 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Segar/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the US and elsewhere, this myth was long ago racialised by such things as the exclusion from trade unions of people of colour \u2013 and the idea, rooted in the mess of racist beliefs that swirled around slavery and empire, that the work ethic is somehow a white preserve. It is here that base prejudice and a crisis of economic status fuse together, something exemplified when Trump told last week\u2019s already infamous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/17/trump-rally-send-her-back-ilhan-omar\" title=\"\">rally</a> in North Carolina that the black congresswoman Ilhan Omar \u201clooks down with contempt on the hardworking American\u201d \u2013 people who, as he well knows, may well be wondering if they will soon be doing any work at all and therefore looking for a scapegoat.</p> <p>On the face of it, Britain may not fit quite as snugly into this picture of technological transformation feeding political (and moral) breakdown: so far, this country\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/09/06/britains-unemployment-is-ultra-low-but-its-wages-are-ultra-measly\" title=\"\">levels of manufacturing automation</a> have lagged behind those of many other countries, and politicians hold up our supposedly low levels of unemployment as proof that if there is a storm, we are still riding it out. But we, too, have a story to tell about the links between a new industrial revolution and rising levels of resentment and rage.</p> <p>I think I know what the immediate British economic future will look like, not least if Johnson and the Tories use Brexit as a pretext for kicking away whatever employment regulations we have left. Two years ago I <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/nov/25/cobot-machine-coming-job-robots-amazon-ocado\" title=\"\">visited</a> the corporate headquarters of the online supermarket Ocado, in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Its operations were divided in two by a supply road, along which hulking delivery lorries came and went. On one side software engineers, hardware inventors and marketing specialists worked on the business\u2019s public face, and such innovations as robotic arms that will soon be able to handle no end of goods. Clutching coffees and dressed in functional casualwear, they looked happy and affluent.

      "bodyText": "This week\u2019s nightmare is the arrival of Boris Johnson; the autumn brings the Brexit watershed. Soon after, the 2020 US election takes shape, compounding the sense that politics everywhere is in a state of complete unpredictability. All that is clear, perhaps, is that the forces gathered around Brexit, Donald Trump and the various brands of European populism still think things are going their way. For some people, everything comes down to the failures of neoliberalism and its inbuilt globalisation, and the long aftershocks from the crash of 2008. Others, with very good reason, focus on racism and bigotry, and the spectacle of white men who are apparently convinced that their time at the top is about to come to a close and therefore lashing out. There are also people who seem to think that any sober, cause-and-effect explanations of a global crisis are impossible amid the mess: they tend to take refuge in rather specious ideas about \u201ccollective derangement\u201d and national nervous breakdowns. What is not mentioned nearly enough is actually plain to see. We live in a time of deep economic disruption. The ongoing transformation of production and consumption by computing power is everywhere: in hollowed-out town and city centres and a labour market that seems to be increasingly divided between tech-literate, university-educated people at the top, and those pushed down into work that is service-based, insecure and poorly paid. Digital innovation is not separate from but integral to the offshoring of jobs: technology allows companies to oversee production from a distance, and coordinate massively complicated modern supply chains. These things form the basic facts of our age, and a lot of political phenomena have to be understood accordingly. This is the basic argument of a book I have been lost in for the last 10 days: The Technology Trap, by the Swedish-German economist and historian Carl Benedikt Frey. His basic thesis is that this phase of the 21st century is turning out to be very like the early 19th, in the sense that technology is causing a great crisis of status, security and trust in institutions. Back then, the stereotypical dissenter was a skilled weaver in a newly industrialising area of England, horrified by the arrival of mechanised mills and rightly fearing a collapse in esteem and earnings. Now, a global storm centres on similarly angry people \u2013 men, very often \u2013 in such US states as Ohio. \u201cNot every manufacturing town there voted for Trump,\u201d Frey writes. \u201cBut electoral districts specialising in industries that have invested heavily in automation overwhelmingly did.\u201d He points out that in these places, a whole swath of the old socioeconomic middle, encompassing everyone from machine operators to mortgage underwriters, has been shrinking away for at least three decades \u2013 and to lose a once secure job in these circumstances is to surrender any chance of comparable stability. Nonetheless, many people affected by such experiences have an enduring personal investment in an idea Frey terms the \u201cdisciplined self\u201d: an idea invented as a means of \u201ctaking pride in monotonous toil on a factory\u2019s assembly line\u201d, bolstering the self-worth of male breadwinners. In the US and elsewhere, this myth was long ago racialised by such things as the exclusion from trade unions of people of colour \u2013 and the idea, rooted in the mess of racist beliefs that swirled around slavery and empire, that the work ethic is somehow a white preserve. It is here that base prejudice and a crisis of economic status fuse together, something exemplified when Trump told last week\u2019s already infamous rally in North Carolina that the black congresswoman Ilhan Omar \u201clooks down with contempt on the hardworking American\u201d \u2013 people who, as he well knows, may well be wondering if they will soon be doing any work at all and therefore looking for a scapegoat. On the face of it, Britain may not fit quite as snugly into this picture of technological transformation feeding political (and moral) breakdown: so far, this country\u2019s levels of manufacturing automation have lagged behind those of many other countries, and politicians hold up our supposedly low levels of unemployment as proof that if there is a storm, we are still riding it out. But we, too, have a story to tell about the links between a new industrial revolution and rising levels of resentment and rage. I think I know what the immediate British economic future will look like, not least if Johnson and the Tories use Brexit as a pretext for kicking away whatever employment regulations we have left. Two years ago I visited the corporate headquarters of the online supermarket Ocado, in Hatfield, Hertfordshire. Its operations were divided in two by a supply road, along which hulking delivery lorries came and went. On one side software engineers, hardware inventors and marketing specialists worked on the business\u2019s public face, and such innovations as robotic arms that will soon be able to handle no end of goods. Clutching coffees and dressed in functional casualwear, they looked happy and affluent. But over the road, pickers being paid between \u00a38 and \u00a310.65, and working often impossibly timed shifts, were dutifully doing many of the jobs that \u2013 as far as I understood it \u2013 would eventually be automated away. People in this country know that in the absence of a professional middle, the chance of even relative affluence now depends on falling on the right side of this kind of divide, and that for millions of us, the challenges that entails are impossible. All those empty shops are a constant reminder that automation is eating away at the retail jobs that were once proffered as a replacement for those lost in manufacturing and heavy industry. Like the US, if our politics is now clouded by aggressive nostalgia and an aversion to thinking about the future, this is a key reason why. So far, technology has not been one of the favoured themes of the western world\u2019s populists, who are still much keener on talking about work and prosperity in the context of globalisation, trade and such supra-national institutions as the EU. But Frey\u2019s book holds out the prospect of these politicians sooner or later floating the idea of somehow slowing the pace of automation so as to protect their supporters. History offers lessons here: given the convulsions of the industrial revolution led eventually to such liberating, job-creating innovations as mass access to electricity and the internal combustion engine, to do so would threaten things that, in the long run, will surely be to everyone\u2019s benefit. Clearly, any convincing answer to technological disruption lies not in trying to deny the future, but coming up with the kind of ameliorative social programmes \u2013 housebuilding, huge changes to education, either a universal basic income or a system of basic social rights \u2013 that might both protect people and allow them to make the most of huge change.

The protesters, who opposed the event as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/us/drag-queen-story-hour.html\">immoral</a>\u201d, held up signs equating drag with pedophilia, and screamed \u201cShame!

The area is an adopted home base for far-right groups like Patriot Prayer, Identity Evropa/American Identity Movement and the Proud Boys, who have organized numerous marches that have ended in violence.

She told them the event had a policy of having no open carry<em><strong> </strong></em>(that is, no visible weapon), which they were fine with. She accepted their offer.

A recent Stanford University<a href=\"https://hillreporter.com/more-guns-less-crime-a-new-study-debunks-a-long-held-assumption-on-concealed-carry-38243\"> study</a> challenged the longstanding conservative view that more guns equals less crime, finding that states that adopted \u201cright-to-carry\u201d laws (which legalized concealed carry) saw a<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-11/-more-guns-less-crime-stanford-rtc-study-suggests-otherwise\"> 13% increase</a> in violent crime over 10 years.</p> <p>Washington state\u2019s relatively loose gun laws mean that even those with minimal training are able to show up to public events armed, which has potentially lethal implications. At a Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of Washington in 2017, an antifascist protester was<a href=\"https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/trial-for-couple-accused-of-assault-at-uw-during-milo-yiannopoulos-appearance-is-delayed-for-appeal/\"> shot in the stomach</a> by a Trump supporter named Elizabeth Hokoana, who then claimed self-defense; if convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison.</p> <p>This is the context in which an armed community defense group has been invited to protect a trans pride event.

The club views gun control through a specifically leftist political lens. As Duke sees it, the root cause of American violence isn\u2019t the guns themselves; it\u2019s inequality.</p> <p>\u201cIt comes out of not wanting to arm former slaves and people in poverty who are struggling and organizing, and so when we talk about gun control in America, what we really should be talking about is capital control. If you read the<a href=\"https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/dred-scott-case\"> Dred Scott decision</a>, there\u2019s a line in there that says \u2018We don\u2019t want to grant citizenship because Black people might get guns,\u2019 and I think that says an awful lot about America and gun control.\u201d</p> <p>White privilege is something that is repeatedly brought up throughout the weekend (while there are people of color in the organization, the membership is majority white). Shannon says that, due to her \u201cmiddle-aged white lady veneer,\u201d she knows she will be treated differently by police when she open carries at a protest.</p> <p>In a recent appearance on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/shows/united-shades-of-america\">W Kamau Bell\u2019s United Shades of America</a>, a documentary series for CNN in which he travels America to explore race-based subcultures, Duke and several other members<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wkamaubellofficial/posts/10156883966326273?comment_id=10156987386916273&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D\"> sat down</a> with the comedian and Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza to talk guns and race; the episode was shown on CNN, and netted the group a significant amount of attention \u2013 some positive, some less so from the rightwing trolls who targeted them on social media. It was a reminder, they say, that public exposure brings risks. Members face serious potential repercussions in both their personal and professional lives, as well as constant threats from rightwing extremists.</p> <p>Fozz, a union organizer by trade, has been on suspension for the past four months after his involvement with the PSJBCG during his off hours was made the subject of an investigation at work. His supervisors identified a photo of him open-carrying at a protest; according to Fozz, the suspension was framed as a workplace safety issue because his bosses believe that he is capable of violence.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing as well as deeply concerning that an organization like a labor union would actually be critical of someone that takes the time and resources and expenses to stand up to people that would attack its membership,\u201d he says. \u201cI asked them the question, why do you guys have such a problem with a Jew standing up to neo-Nazis that are threatening his neighborhood?\u201d</p> <p>That weekend, none of the Proud Boys or other fascist provocateurs did show up to Trans Pride. For now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was off the clock.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The van lumbered down one of Seattle\u2019s many steep hills. A half dozen people packed inside but despite the heat, most wore long pants and boots, and several sported black hoodies. The atmosphere was subdued, except for the occasional joke. It wasn\u2019t so much tension as seriousness \u2013 there was work to be done. The people in the van are members of the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club (PSJBGC). Their stated aim is to fight white supremacy and build community defense in America\u2019s Pacific north-west, and their presence has become a fixture of protests in the Seattle and Tacoma areas, where the group is often invited to provide security against rightwing aggression. The night before, several of them had been called to a library in nearby Renton, Washington, where a Drag Story Time Hour, an event series in which a local drag queen or drag king reads to children in a library or bookstore, was being disrupted by rightwing protesters. The protesters, who opposed the event as \u201cimmoral\u201d, held up signs equating drag with pedophilia, and screamed \u201cShame! Shame!\u201d at parents and their kids. Among them were members of the Proud Boys, a violent rightwing street gang, and Three Percenters militia, who were open-carrying firearms. The north-west has been at the center of tense political clashes over the last two years. The area is an adopted home base for far-right groups like Patriot Prayer, Identity Evropa/American Identity Movement and the Proud Boys, who have organized numerous marches that have ended in violence. In response, a range of leftist groups have organized self defence groups and, in doing so, present gun ownership as a way to protect themselves and others. Now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was en route to Seattle\u2019s Trans Pride March. In the weeks prior, word spread that a number of white supremacist groups had planned to disrupt the celebration. Hearing this, the club reached out to the organizers of the event, the Gender Justice League, and offered to assist with security or to provide escorts. Brooke Wylie, the head of security for the Gender Justice League in charge of overseeing the 101-person security detail for the event, did some research on the club. She told them the event had a policy of having no open carry (that is, no visible weapon), which they were fine with. She accepted their offer. Police were also present, but many marginalized groups do not trust them to provide protection at public events, especially when far-right groups are involved. Each member showed up with a concealed handgun. \u201cWe do our actions proportional to the threat, so when other people are out with rifles, we\u2019ll be out with rifles,\u201d Nick, the group\u2019s de facto spokesperson, explained. \u201cIn this case, we don\u2019t want to appear threatening for the people that we\u2019re trying to protect and support; we want this to be a happy atmosphere, especially for a population that may have faced gun violence on the street just for being who they are.\u201d This scenario \u2013 in which armed community groups are working together to patrol a Pride event and protect it from other malicious and potentially armed groups \u2013 is becoming more and more common. There are more guns than people in America \u2013 approximately 393 million in a country of 328 million people. An average of 34,501 people died each year from firearms; in 2018, 992 of those deaths were the result of police shootings. And the memory of the Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016, when 49 people were killed at a mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Florida, is still hanging heavily over the LGBTQ community. Throughout the day, Puget Sound members stood watch oversections of the park, staying connected via walkie-talkies. \u201cThank you for being here!\u201d was a common refrain from march-goers, as were inquiries on how to join (the group has a several-month long vetting process and probationary period for prospective recruits.) Unlike some of the other masked antifascist groups at the march that day, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club consider themselves to be an \u201caboveground\u201d organization, and choose not to cover their faces. \u201cPart of the reason we don\u2019t cover our faces is that we don\u2019t want to present as though we are a militia,\u201d Fozz, a longtime member, explained. \u201cWe are not. We want to build relationships with people in our community, we want to appear approachable.\u201d While the group has not used deadly force, a former member of the group, Willem Van Spronsen, recently made headlines when he was killed by police after trying to set fire to Ice vehicles in a parking lot outside the Northwest Detention Center In Tacoma, Washington, a private immigration detainment facility. \u2018You don\u2019t want to be the antifa cop\u2019 Gun control advocates are quick to point out that more guns often means more violence, no matter the intent behind them. A recent Stanford University study challenged the longstanding conservative view that more guns equals less crime, finding that states that adopted \u201cright-to-carry\u201d laws (which legalized concealed carry) saw a 13% increase in violent crime over 10 years. Washington state\u2019s relatively loose gun laws mean that even those with minimal training are able to show up to public events armed, which has potentially lethal implications. At a Milo Yiannopoulos rally at the University of Washington in 2017, an antifascist protester was shot in the stomach by a Trump supporter named Elizabeth Hokoana, who then claimed self-defense; if convicted, she faces up to 15 years in prison. This is the context in which an armed community defense group has been invited to protect a trans pride event. The thinking goes that, since there are already guns everywhere, and the people who want to hurt minority groups are often heavily armed, their side may as well have guns, too. When asked about how they would react if a survivor of gun violence came up and confronted them about their decision to bring guns into a public protest space, the Puget Sound Club members say that they would approach the situation with empathy. A member named Seraphiad pointed to their own history with gun violence as a starting point. \u201cThe reason some people decide to carry is because they too have been victims of gun violence and other forms of violence,\u201d they explained. \u201cI would relate to them based on my own experience with violence and share my choice to protect myself.\u201d For many other left-leaning organizations, guns remain a difficult topic. The second amendment has attained almost religious significance to some conservative gun owners, while gun control has become a defining issue for centrists and liberals, the opinions of those on the more radical left vary. The Democratic Socialists of America, for example, responded to an interview request for this piece by saying, \u201cthe DSA has no comment on gun controls or the second amendment. Our members represent a diversity of viewpoints on this topic.\u201d Others have been more forthcoming. Patrick Blanchfield, the author of a forthcoming book on guns and the left called Gunpower, doesn\u2019t specifically oppose the idea of armed self-defense, but he sees it as a potential danger to both the individual as well as a broader group or community, referencing the government\u2019s brutal assaults on the Black Panthers as a historical example. Blanchfield also sees an issue in the way armed groups have the potential to inadvertently replicate existing oppressive structures. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be the antifa cop,\u201d he explains. \u201cFor example, I would need some convincing that armed leftists didn\u2019t shoot partners at a rate substantially lower than non-leftists.\u201d \u2018There were swastikas in my kid\u2019s park\u2019 The Puget Sound chapter is part of a long American leftist tradition of armed groups, from the Black Panthers to current groups like Redneck Revolt, the Socialist Rifle Association, Trigger Warning Queer &amp; Trans Gun Club, and the Los Angeles Black Coyote Collective. Twenty-one members turned up that day. Nick, Fozz and a member who goes by Reverend were joined by Cat, a diminutive, self-described \u201csoccer mom\u201d; quiet, serious Vixen, with strawberry blonde hair and orange knee socks; Duke, the group\u2019s stocky, bearded founder; and Shannon, a civil rights attorney and constitutional law professor. There are plenty of anarchists among their ranks, but there are also people like Shannon who feel strongly about the second amendment and who are more interested in working within existing frameworks than tearing them down. \u201cThere\u2019s power in knowledge of the constitution,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to be a knowledgeable person whose politics are left of center, and be willing to understand and fight back within the legal framework.\u201d Duke, a lifelong anarchist who founded the Seattle chapter in 2017, describes himself as having retired from activism following the birth of his son in 2012. He did \u201cnormal progressive Seattle dad\u201d things like taking his family to Black Lives Matter and Fight for 15 rallies until 2017, when he was inspired to act following the election of Donald Trump \u2013 and more specifically, by the proliferation of hate crimes that plagued Seattle during its lead-up. According to the Seattle Times, hate crimes increased in Washington by 32% between 2016 and 2017, and Duke, who is Jewish, had a front-row seat. \u201cI really got active in John Brown Gun Club because there were swastikas in my kid\u2019s park,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew a lot of people at that point who were organizing with Redneck Revolt across the country, so I was like, this is something I can do. So I formed this chapter, and members started flocking to us.\u201d The rise of white supremacist violence since 2016 served as a flashpoint for many members\u2019 decisions to arm themselves. Fozz, who is Jewish, told a story about sitting down with his wife after Trump\u2019s election and deciding which of them was going to learn how to use a gun, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to need it.\u201d For others, it was the shock of violence at the fatal 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville that sparked their interest in armed self-defense. \u201cAfter Charlottesville, there was this recognition that there has to be somebody who\u2019s not on the right who is willing to be in places that law enforcement either isn\u2019t willing to be, or where law enforcement is supporting fascists,\u201d Shannon explains. \u201cWhen you see law enforcement escorting Nazi groups to parades [in places like DC or Detroit] you realize there\u2019s a space to be filled by people who are confident in their skill as gun owners but whose bigger mission is community defense and protection.\u201d For Vixen, the decision to join came from the threats rightwing extremism poses to her identity. A trans woman who grew up shooting guns off her front porch in Indiana, she spoke about the toxic culture she had encountered at many gun ranges, and of the obligation she felt to protect her queer community. \u201cToday, I\u2019m a trans woman at Trans Pride, so I feel like I\u2019m personally able to step in front and put myself in front of people who are being attacked or harassed and just try to de-escalate the situation \u2013 which is always the goal,\u201d she said. \u201cObviously, you don\u2019t ever want to celebrate having to use force on someone, but completely throwing it away as an option is really self-defeating.\u201d So far, none of the members have had to use their weapons in this context, and the hope expressed is that they never will. The day after the march, Cat, Nick, Duke, Reverend and Fozz gathered at a coffee shop to debrief. The club views gun control through a specifically leftist political lens. As Duke sees it, the root cause of American violence isn\u2019t the guns themselves; it\u2019s inequality. \u201cIt comes out of not wanting to arm former slaves and people in poverty who are struggling and organizing, and so when we talk about gun control in America, what we really should be talking about is capital control. If you read the Dred Scott decision, there\u2019s a line in there that says \u2018We don\u2019t want to grant citizenship because Black people might get guns,\u2019 and I think that says an awful lot about America and gun control.\u201d White privilege is something that is repeatedly brought up throughout the weekend (while there are people of color in the organization, the membership is majority white). Shannon says that, due to her \u201cmiddle-aged white lady veneer,\u201d she knows she will be treated differently by police when she open carries at a protest. In a recent appearance on W Kamau Bell\u2019s United Shades of America, a documentary series for CNN in which he travels America to explore race-based subcultures, Duke and several other members sat down with the comedian and Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza to talk guns and race; the episode was shown on CNN, and netted the group a significant amount of attention \u2013 some positive, some less so from the rightwing trolls who targeted them on social media. It was a reminder, they say, that public exposure brings risks. Members face serious potential repercussions in both their personal and professional lives, as well as constant threats from rightwing extremists. Fozz, a union organizer by trade, has been on suspension for the past four months after his involvement with the PSJBCG during his off hours was made the subject of an investigation at work. His supervisors identified a photo of him open-carrying at a protest; according to Fozz, the suspension was framed as a workplace safety issue because his bosses believe that he is capable of violence. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing as well as deeply concerning that an organization like a labor union would actually be critical of someone that takes the time and resources and expenses to stand up to people that would attack its membership,\u201d he says. \u201cI asked them the question, why do you guys have such a problem with a Jew standing up to neo-Nazis that are threatening his neighborhood?\u201d That weekend, none of the Proud Boys or other fascist provocateurs did show up to Trans Pride. For now, the Puget Sound John Brown Gun Club was off the clock.",

Why? Well, to put it simply, ECT is the most rapid treatment for severe depression that we currently have to offer \u2013 with a recent study in the BMJ <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/364/bmj.l1079\" title=\"\">highlighting its effectiveness</a>.</p> <p>For the uninitiated, ECT is a medical procedure in which an anaesthetised patient has a small electrical current applied to their scalp in order to induce a seizure for the purposes of treating severe mental illnesses and occasionally neurological disorders too.

ECT course length varies depending on the needs of the patient, but on average eight to 12 treatments are given.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I raise the possibility of ECT with patients, their response is often one of fear, arising from outdated ideas</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s almost impossible to discuss ECT without the word \u201cbarbaric\u201d being used.

How?</p> \n<p>One can easily construct a narrative of exogenous forces that have brought the former foreign secretary to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/johnson-leads-hunt-by-two-to-one-in-tory-leader-race-poll\" title=\"\">threshold of N</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/johnson-leads-hunt-by-two-to-one-in-tory-leader-race-poll\" title=\"\">o </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/13/johnson-leads-hunt-by-two-to-one-in-tory-leader-race-poll\" title=\"\">10</a>: the patronage of one-time Telegraph owner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/15/conrad-black-trump-pardons-ex-media-mogul\" title=\"\">Conrad Black</a>, the lobbying of those who argued against John Major\u2019s initial instinct that Johnson should be kept off the Tory candidates\u2019 list, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/20/cameron-set-to-name-eu-referendum-date-after-cabinet-meeting\" title=\"\">David Cameron\u2019s decision</a> to hold the EU referendum that turbocharged his claim to the top job. But I don\u2019t think such an account gets us to the heart of the matter; in fact, it is essentially dishonest.</p> \n<p>To understand how Johnson and the rest of us have reached this point, one has to understand the stage upon which he has strutted. One has to grasp both cultural context and collective complicity. First, one must acknowledge, without qualification or excuse, the huge role that the media \u2013 and not just the rightwing press \u2013 has played in Johnson\u2019s rise. And this is a very English, and mostly male, story.</p> \n<p>Johnson is the spawn of two institutions \u2013 Eton and Oxford \u2013 that, at least in his day, taught men to assume that they were going to be in charge; of what scarcely mattered. Their principal bequest to their alumni was a potent brew of nonchalance, presumption and confidence. Of course, life has a way of draining a surfeit of such attributes from most people, but not all. Even in his darkest hour Johnson has never faltered in his belief that he is different, better and destined for greatness.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0cd3cadf6ca6d8c73faacf4e775c308e621ac37\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0cd3cadf6ca6d8c73faacf4e775c308e621ac37/0_194_3317_1990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson at the Tory leadership hustings in London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018What Johnson understood was that in the digital age voters were behaving more like an audience consuming entertainment than a civically engaged electorate.\u2019</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kirsty O\u2019Connor/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His fellow male journalists fell for this precisely because it was marketed with an artful buffoonery straight from the pages of PG Wodehouse. Especially in his early years, Johnson had the will to power of Pinochet and the social graces of Gussie Fink-Nottle.</p> \n<p>He was clever without being a swot. He winged it, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain\" title=\"\">drove his editors mad</a> but inspired considerable envy in his peers. He was fun.</p> \n<p>He activated the narcotic weakness within the English for eccentricity \u2013 especially potent when it is suspected that the eccentric in question may one day be the leader of the gang. All too often one heard the words \u201cthat\u2019s just Boris being Boris\u201d, as if his singular character conferred upon him a special kind of impunity. But it wasn\u2019t his character that did that. It was his fellow hacks, who indulged him for year after year, through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/jul/17/boris-johnson-gaff-prone-character-controversies\" title=\"\">controversy after controversy</a> \u2013 because he was part of what was still largely a brotherhood.</p> \n<p>I\u2019d love to exempt myself from this audit of blame, but I can\u2019t \u2013 at least not entirely.

      "bodyText": "How can this be happening?\u201d I have lost count of the number of times I have been asked this question in the past few weeks. What people want to know \u2013 and I mean people from across the political spectrum \u2013 is how Boris Johnson, barring a serious upset, is about to become prime minister, first lord of the Treasury, and generally in charge of everything. How? One can easily construct a narrative of exogenous forces that have brought the former foreign secretary to the threshold of No 10: the patronage of one-time Telegraph owner Conrad Black, the lobbying of those who argued against John Major\u2019s initial instinct that Johnson should be kept off the Tory candidates\u2019 list, David Cameron\u2019s decision to hold the EU referendum that turbocharged his claim to the top job. But I don\u2019t think such an account gets us to the heart of the matter; in fact, it is essentially dishonest. To understand how Johnson and the rest of us have reached this point, one has to understand the stage upon which he has strutted. One has to grasp both cultural context and collective complicity. First, one must acknowledge, without qualification or excuse, the huge role that the media \u2013 and not just the rightwing press \u2013 has played in Johnson\u2019s rise. And this is a very English, and mostly male, story. Johnson is the spawn of two institutions \u2013 Eton and Oxford \u2013 that, at least in his day, taught men to assume that they were going to be in charge; of what scarcely mattered. Their principal bequest to their alumni was a potent brew of nonchalance, presumption and confidence. Of course, life has a way of draining a surfeit of such attributes from most people, but not all. Even in his darkest hour Johnson has never faltered in his belief that he is different, better and destined for greatness. His fellow male journalists fell for this precisely because it was marketed with an artful buffoonery straight from the pages of PG Wodehouse. Especially in his early years, Johnson had the will to power of Pinochet and the social graces of Gussie Fink-Nottle. He was clever without being a swot. He winged it, which drove his editors mad but inspired considerable envy in his peers. He was fun. He activated the narcotic weakness within the English for eccentricity \u2013 especially potent when it is suspected that the eccentric in question may one day be the leader of the gang. All too often one heard the words \u201cthat\u2019s just Boris being Boris\u201d, as if his singular character conferred upon him a special kind of impunity. But it wasn\u2019t his character that did that. It was his fellow hacks, who indulged him for year after year, through controversy after controversy \u2013 because he was part of what was still largely a brotherhood. I\u2019d love to exempt myself from this audit of blame, but I can\u2019t \u2013 at least not entirely. Though I was never a member of Team Boris in the press corps \u2013 those who believed, once he became an MP, that he should rise to the very top \u2013 the two of us maintained a civil acquaintance as fellow members of the media-industrial complex for two decades. When I succeeded him at the Spectator in 2006, he was impeccably helpful and supportive. I commissioned articles from him and ran them on the cover. Did this skew my judgment of him as a political creature? That\u2019s for others to judge. Certainly, he can\u2019t stand what I\u2019m writing about him these days. But I can\u2019t rule out the possibility that, in the past, I pulled my punches from time to time. Thus indulged by his peers, Johnson was perfectly placed for a cultural shift of prodigious importance that he intuited very early: namely, the colonisation of politics by the entertainment industry. Let me be clear: I absolutely don\u2019t mean the theatrical dimension of power, which is as old as the charismatic leadership rituals of prehistoric tribes. No, I mean the ultramodern colonisation of politics by show business and its tropes. What Johnson understood was that in the digital age, voters were behaving more like an audience consuming entertainment than a civically engaged electorate. His shtick was no longer an aspect of his politics. It was his politics. While the rest of Westminster operated within the structures of 20th-century political discourse, Johnson worked on his material like a standup preparing for a Netflix special. And we let him get away with it. Be absolutely candid: a fair few of you laughed along more than occasionally, didn\u2019t you? Precisely because he was different, precisely because he didn\u2019t seem like another starchy old Tory. All of which converged neatly with the plummeting trust in institutions that has marked the first quarter of this century. Like Donald Trump, Johnson understands that the more scornful you appear of the traditional political process the more you appeal to your target voters. You signal to them: \u201cI hate regular politics, and politicians, and journalists, as much as you do.\u201d During Andrew Neil\u2019s brilliant recent forensic demolition of Johnson in a BBC interview, it was remarkable to see the massacred Johnson smirking away and gurning in irritation. He did the same in his ITV debate with Jeremy Hunt, narrowing his eyes and grimacing as if the whole business were a monstrous impertinence for a Man of Destiny. The blame is not evenly distributed.

Breathalyzer tests are a quick and non-invasive way to tell if a driver is drunk.</p> <p>But testing for stoned drivers isn\u2019t as straightforward. Some jurisdictions, including Colorado, have set standards for what constitutes cannabis impairment, such as five nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood. But there is no linear correlation between blood THC concentration and impairment, and testing requires a blood or saliva sample.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/08/can-cannabis-treat-anxiety-its-complicated\">Can cannabis treat anxiety? It's complicated</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What\u2019s more, THC stays in the bloodstream for weeks \u2013 so compared with alcohol, its presence reveals less about a driver\u2019s condition. These complications have made it a challenge to gauge whether legalization makes the roads more hazardous. Some areas have laws that define a predetermined concentration of THC in the blood as illegal whether or not the driver appears impaired.</p> <p>As a result, while marijuana can impair motor skills, the available data, as discussed in<a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/812440-marijuana-impaired-driving-report-to-congress.pdf\"> a 2017 report</a> by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, suggests the odds of being involved in a crash immediately after using cannabis are significantly lower than crash rates after drinking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"436a7a9e51ef5ce3d567d90e48224b017aa19222\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/436a7a9e51ef5ce3d567d90e48224b017aa19222/0_0_989_671/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stoned driving illustration for High Time column\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The stock explanation is alcohol makes drivers more aggressive and accident prone, while drivers who are high are more likely to drive too slowly. Several studies cited by NHTSA suggest this is broadly correct.</p> <p>So while it\u2019s generally illegal to drive while high, it\u2019s not clear if stoned driving is a serious problem or if police tactics can do much about it. Nonetheless, public safety considerations require places with legal cannabis to think about the issue and sometimes take action.</p> <p>Before legalizing recreational use in October, Canada approved one device, the <a href=\"https://www.draeger.com/en-us_us/Applications/Products/Breath-Alcohol-and-Drug-Testing/Drug-Testing-Devices/DrugTest-5000\">Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest 5000</a>, as a roadside spit tester for THC. But questions have been raised about its accuracy; it is known to <a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/concerns-raised-about-first-device-set-to-be-approved-for-roadside-drug-detection-1.4047206\">deliver both false positives and false negatives</a>. And when it measures correctly, it doesn\u2019t claim to assess the subject\u2019s fitness to drive. Another problem: the device only works at temperatures between 4C and 40C. It\u2019s useless during Canada\u2019s long, cold winters.</p> <p>The country has recently approved a second THC saliva test, the Abbott SoToxa. Six months after legalization, Canada\u2019s federal law enforcement agency, the RCMP, said there <a href=\"https://globalnews.ca/news/5201426/cannabis-impaired-driving-charges-rcmp/\">had not been a surge in charges</a> for driving high.</p> <p>But driving high happens. The California delivery service Eaze recently surveyed cannabis users on how they get around.</p> <p>It found 64% of cannabis consumers self-report driving within four hours of consuming cannabis and 20% say they drive within an hour after consuming.

      "bodyText": "Nobody recommends driving while high. But years into legalization, it\u2019s not clear if stoned drivers have become a hazard that demands a response. Even if they were, nobody would know what to do about them. Blood alcohol content and impairment generally rise in parallel, and the alcohol leaves the body relatively quickly. Breathalyzer tests are a quick and non-invasive way to tell if a driver is drunk. But testing for stoned drivers isn\u2019t as straightforward. Some jurisdictions, including Colorado, have set standards for what constitutes cannabis impairment, such as five nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood. But there is no linear correlation between blood THC concentration and impairment, and testing requires a blood or saliva sample. What\u2019s more, THC stays in the bloodstream for weeks \u2013 so compared with alcohol, its presence reveals less about a driver\u2019s condition. These complications have made it a challenge to gauge whether legalization makes the roads more hazardous. Some areas have laws that define a predetermined concentration of THC in the blood as illegal whether or not the driver appears impaired. As a result, while marijuana can impair motor skills, the available data, as discussed in a 2017 report by the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, suggests the odds of being involved in a crash immediately after using cannabis are significantly lower than crash rates after drinking. The stock explanation is alcohol makes drivers more aggressive and accident prone, while drivers who are high are more likely to drive too slowly. Several studies cited by NHTSA suggest this is broadly correct. So while it\u2019s generally illegal to drive while high, it\u2019s not clear if stoned driving is a serious problem or if police tactics can do much about it. Nonetheless, public safety considerations require places with legal cannabis to think about the issue and sometimes take action. Before legalizing recreational use in October, Canada approved one device, the Dr\u00e4ger DrugTest 5000, as a roadside spit tester for THC. But questions have been raised about its accuracy; it is known to deliver both false positives and false negatives. And when it measures correctly, it doesn\u2019t claim to assess the subject\u2019s fitness to drive. Another problem: the device only works at temperatures between 4C and 40C. It\u2019s useless during Canada\u2019s long, cold winters. The country has recently approved a second THC saliva test, the Abbott SoToxa. Six months after legalization, Canada\u2019s federal law enforcement agency, the RCMP, said there had not been a surge in charges for driving high. But driving high happens. The California delivery service Eaze recently surveyed cannabis users on how they get around. It found 64% of cannabis consumers self-report driving within four hours of consuming cannabis and 20% say they drive within an hour after consuming. There was no consensus among consumers about how much cannabis is safe to take before driving. (They were less likely to drive stoned with a child in the car.) Of adults who consume and drive, 77% believe it doesn\u2019t affect their driving and 16% believe it improves their driving, according to the survey. Men and younger drivers are more likely to drive within eight hours of consuming. A new law in California directs the state highway patrol to research better ways to determine an evidence-based response to stoned drivers. Until we have one, it will be another aspect of marijuana legalization that raises more questions than answers.",

Leptospirosis, a bacterial infection that can kill dogs in 48 hours and is also fatal to humans, had never caused a canine death in New South Wales. But in the past three months there have been seven. On Monday the lord mayor, Clover Moore, said she was taking drastic measures against the vermin that have been \u201cstirred up\u201d by unprecedented levels of construction. \u201cWe have been very concerned by the recent cases of leptospirosis in Sydney, affecting dogs in our local area, so have decided to double the number of rat bait stations in public areas and increase inspections to monitor rat activity,\u201d she said. The council will run 860 bait stations and will deploy additional baits to specific locations based on complaints from locals. Leptospirosis is stored in the kidneys of infected rats, spread in their urine, and can stay alive in water and moist environments. All confirmed fatalities occurred in the inner-city suburb of Surry Hills. In February the council said Sydney\u2019s construction boom was \u201cstirring up rat populations\u201d and \u201cleading to increased rat movements\u201d after five rats were spotted in a chicken chain restaurant, and one was seen in a dumpling restaurant. Veterinary experts say this could be behind the leptospirosis outbreak. An ecologist, Peter Banks, from the University of Sydney, told the Daily Telegraph larger, hungrier brown rats were becoming the dominant species in the city. There is a vaccine for leptospirosis and it is commonly prescribed for dogs in Queensland, but not in NSW due to its previous rarity. Moore said she had also asked for cooperation from other government bodies because the council can place baits only on land it owns. \u201cWe can\u2019t fight the rat problem on our own,\u201d she said. \u201cThe city has written to Sydney Trains, Property NSW, Sydney Water and NSW Land and Housing Corporation to urge them to increase baiting and monitoring of rats on their land. \u201cWe also need residents and businesses to take care with food scraps and other waste. Our regulatory staff will continue to target poor waste management practices and illegal dumping in hot spots.\u201d City of Sydney employs 135 staff to monitor and control rats. Pet owners have been advised to discuss leptospirosis and potential vaccination with their vet. They are also advised to keep their dogs away from puddles and ponds and wash their hands when feeding or touching their dogs. The disease is spread through the mouth, gum, eyes and skin abrasions.

Until recently Danes could divorce by filling out a simple online form. But under a package of legislation that came into force in April, couples determined to split must wait three months and undergo counselling before their marriage can be dissolved. Meanwhile, a survey by Politiken newspaper found that 68 of Denmark\u2019s 98 local authorities were offering relationship therapy to couples in difficulty, on the grounds that keeping families together saves municipalities money on housing and services. The initiatives, which in some countries might be seen as unwelcome state intrusion in citizens\u2019 private lives, have been broadly welcomed by both the public and politicians in Denmark, with only the small Liberal Alliance party criticising them as over-reach. The country has long championed family rights, offering year-long parental leave and universal public daycare, but it recorded 15,000 divorces in 2018, equivalent to nearly half the marriages that year. \u201cThis is about reducing the human and the financial costs of divorce,\u201d said Gert Martin Hald, a psychologist and associate professor of public health at Copenhagen University who helped devise the counselling course, which is now compulsory for all couples with children under 18 before their divorce can be finalised. \u201cIt\u2019s good for both the individual couple but also for the municipality \u2013 prevention is always better than cure,\u201d said Jette Haislund, head of the healthcare department at Ringk\u00f8bing-Skjern municipality in western Denmark, one of the first local authorities to experiment with couples therapy. The government\u2019s three-month waiting period and \u201ccooperation after divorce\u201d course, taken online or via an app, aims to smooth the process for divorcing couples and children by helping them improve communication and avoid pitfalls.

A tense stand-off follows.</p> <p>This corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a frontline of a simmering and sometimes deadly conflict between two largely impoverished groups: the autochthon people, forced out of the forest as part of conservation efforts, and the rangers, who are tasked with protecting the land.</p> <p>The situation across the vast Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga national park, home to the endangered eastern lowland (Grauer) gorilla, is itself a microcosm of growing tensions across the globe between conservation efforts and the rights of tribal peoples displaced by those efforts. </p> <p>Here, the conflict escalated sharply at the beginning of the year, after candidates in national elections encouraged the autochthon \u2013 popularly known as the Pygmies \u2013 to return to the forest. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/20/clash-with-pygmies-near-drc-gorilla-sanctuary-leaves-one-dead-14-injured?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">Violence erupted again</a> at the weekend, leaving one person dead, reportedly a Pygmy, and 14 injured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"63044fdc3e857020e2febe4fc55644f2ac48a601\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63044fdc3e857020e2febe4fc55644f2ac48a601/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Park rangers talk to autochthon people who have just felled a large area of trees for charcoal on the edge of the Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga national park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Park rangers talk to autochthon people who have just felled a large area of trees for charcoal on the edge of the Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga national park</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Holt/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Park rangers talk to autochthon people who have just felled a large area of trees for charcoal on the edge of the Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga park</p></li> </ul> <p>The autochthon sell the charcoal to traders, who in turn sell it at a giant markup in the nearby city of Bukavu, on the border with Rwanda, where it is used as cooking fuel.

In the most recent case, in April, a tracker called Espoir Bajoda had gone to an autochthon village to buy some food while off-duty. An argument ensued and he was killed. The clashes with the autochthon have contributed to a growing crisis of morale, fuelled by the longer term problem of armed militias who operate within the park\u2019s boundaries, and low pay. The rangers earn a basic salary of around $100 (\u00a379) a month before additional payments \u2013 barely enough, they say, to live on.</p> <p>Listed by Unesco as one of 53 world heritage sites under threat, Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga has long faced serious challenges.

      "bodyText": "On a scarred hillside on the edge of the Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga national park, smoke rises from the once-forested slope as men cut down trees and burn them for charcoal. Suddenly, warning cries echo across the landscape. Park rangers are arriving. More men come running to the scene, some carrying machetes in anticipation of a confrontation. A tense stand-off follows. This corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a frontline of a simmering and sometimes deadly conflict between two largely impoverished groups: the autochthon people, forced out of the forest as part of conservation efforts, and the rangers, who are tasked with protecting the land. The situation across the vast Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga national park, home to the endangered eastern lowland (Grauer) gorilla, is itself a microcosm of growing tensions across the globe between conservation efforts and the rights of tribal peoples displaced by those efforts. Here, the conflict escalated sharply at the beginning of the year, after candidates in national elections encouraged the autochthon \u2013 popularly known as the Pygmies \u2013 to return to the forest. Violence erupted again at the weekend, leaving one person dead, reportedly a Pygmy, and 14 injured. Park rangers talk to autochthon people who have just felled a large area of trees for charcoal on the edge of the Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga park The autochthon sell the charcoal to traders, who in turn sell it at a giant markup in the nearby city of Bukavu, on the border with Rwanda, where it is used as cooking fuel. Standing in a recently felled area, Mirindi Songolo (below), a 23-year-old autochthon villager, says his people have no choice. \u201cWe are cutting the forest because we do not [otherwise] have the means to survive,\u201d he says. \u201cThis was our land that was taken for the park. Our forefathers were born here. Now there are so many of us [in the communities outside the park] there is no room for us. That\u2019s why we decided to come into the park to cut trees for charcoal.\u201d A second man interjects: \u201cThe solution would be for the government to give us the land or money to live somewhere else, because it is too difficult for us to live the way we are now.\u201d A short distance away, park official Gloria Mwenge Bitomwa reflects on the deaths since last year of four rangers. In the most recent case, in April, a tracker called Espoir Bajoda had gone to an autochthon village to buy some food while off-duty. An argument ensued and he was killed. The clashes with the autochthon have contributed to a growing crisis of morale, fuelled by the longer term problem of armed militias who operate within the park\u2019s boundaries, and low pay. The rangers earn a basic salary of around $100 (\u00a379) a month before additional payments \u2013 barely enough, they say, to live on. Listed by Unesco as one of 53 world heritage sites under threat, Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga has long faced serious challenges. Spread over 600,000 hectares (1.5m acres) and dominated by its two extinct volcanoes, the park encompasses a variety of ecosystems, from lowland forests to montane highlands, forests of bamboo and even areas of sub-alpine prairie, characterised by continuous vegetation. Women carry large sacks of charcoal, illegally made with trees cut from the park Unlike the mountain gorillas found in the nearby Virunga national park as well as in Uganda and Rwanda, eastern lowland gorillas are found in only two locations, and the recent incursions into their Kahuzi-Bi\u00e9ga habitat have created anxiety for the primates, according to the rangers. Songolo says his people were invited back into the park as part of an agreement with authorities, but that a dialogue about what they could and couldn\u2019t do fell apart. The agreement refers to an attempt to introduce arrangements based on the \u201cWhakatane Mechanism\u201d, which was set up to ensure that conservation practices respect the rights of indigenous peoples, and takes its name from a town in New Zealand where a commission was held on the subject in 2011. In theory the Whakatane Mechanism allows for indigenous people to return to conservation areas to practise sustainable activities like foraging, and it has been pioneered elsewhere in Africa. In his house in the rangers\u2019 accommodation near the park\u2019s main administrative office, Kasereka Kioma \u2013 nicknamed Tout Terrain \u2013 and his wife reflect on the difficulties facing the rangers, their concerns over money mirroring those of the autochthons. \u201cI like my job,\u201d he says, adding that he has worked as a ranger for 24 years. \u201cI\u2019m passionate about protecting the gorillas but with a family I don\u2019t earn enough to live on.\u201d His wife, Jeanette, adds that most months she needs to borrow money before his salary comes in to pay for schooling and essentials.

It is just how the cookie crumbles when trying to make sense of a devastated country, that, according to the United Nations, continues to win the ever so coveted title of the world\u2019s most corrupt nation, year after year.</p> <p>When I heard about the death of Nalayeh, I didn\u2019t know just how much of an impact it would have on me as a journalist of over 20 years and now an academic. Media workers reporting from the developing world and conflict zones like myself are a tight-knit community. We are still reeling by her passing.</p> <p>I never met Nalayeh (we do have mutual friends, however). What made this especially difficult for me was that my late father, while involved in very different professions, had a similar life trajectory \u2013 to return to their homeland with the sole aim of helping and healing their people, and in Nalayeh\u2019s case, telling Somali stories in the process.</p> <p>They both paid the ultimate price.</p> <p>Nalayeh was killed along with her husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, and at least 24 others after a bomb exploded outside the Asasey Hotel.</p> <p>Like my father, politics was of no interest to her. Integration TV, an online media platform she founded, aimed to showcase a different side of a nation that has been consistently the butt of every joke regarding failed states.</p> <p>She wanted to show the resilience of the Somali people \u2013 if they can live through a war, they can live through the barbaric antics of al-Shabaab, a group that claims to be Muslim yet regularly kills those of the same faith. Sound familiar? That may well be because they have aligned themselves with Isis.</p> <p>It is no secret that journalism can get you killed in Somalia.</p> <p>Nalayeh\u2019s death symbolises the threat journalists are to al-Shabaab. Even media workers who steer clear of politics portray a people trying to survive and move forward under a cloud of death and destruction. Nalayeh\u2019s depiction of communities that wake up each morning knowing it may be their last sends out a message to these cowards that you may kill many, but you will never take away our traditions. This scares al-Shabaab.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/19/somalia-us-airstrikes-civilian-deaths-amnesty-international\">US airstrikes in Somalia are killing civilians, Amnesty International says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My hope is that Nalayeh\u2019s passing will not be in vain.

      "bodyText": "Numb. The defining emotion that comes to mind every time I hear of a bomb blast or another instance of tribal conflict the east African nation of Somalia has endured over 30 years. The homeland where my parents were born and raised has either been at war, under the threat of extremist attacks or famine for longer than I have been alive. I was born in Australia, the only one of four siblings, all of whom were born in the capital Mogadishu. My family, however, as most Somali families do, consistently teach their children about the language, culture and tradition they were forced to leave behind. Where Somali and African youth face instances of racism and discrimination on an almost daily basis, often resulting in rebelling against a society that has essentially rejected them because of the colour of their skin, Somali parents continue to implore their children to return to their cultural, traditional, linguistic and religious roots. It is not an isolation tactic, but nearly all immigrants in Australia teach their children the importance of knowing where you came from. Hodan Nalayeh, the Canadian-Somali journalist who was killed in a recent bomb blast in the city of Kismayo, wanted the same for her future children \u2013 not only an understanding of a brutal war, but to be proud of a rich history cultivated by their ancestors, and to ultimately be proud of their heritage. \u201cFadlan ku soo noqo xididada dhaqanka.\u201d This is a common phrase used by Somali mothers who beg their children to return to their traditions, a practice they believe will instil discipline and respect for Somalis that came before them, as well as becoming productive members of Australian society. While immensely appreciative in retrospect, one grows accustomed to suffering. It is just how the cookie crumbles when trying to make sense of a devastated country, that, according to the United Nations, continues to win the ever so coveted title of the world\u2019s most corrupt nation, year after year. When I heard about the death of Nalayeh, I didn\u2019t know just how much of an impact it would have on me as a journalist of over 20 years and now an academic. Media workers reporting from the developing world and conflict zones like myself are a tight-knit community. We are still reeling by her passing. I never met Nalayeh (we do have mutual friends, however). What made this especially difficult for me was that my late father, while involved in very different professions, had a similar life trajectory \u2013 to return to their homeland with the sole aim of helping and healing their people, and in Nalayeh\u2019s case, telling Somali stories in the process. They both paid the ultimate price. Nalayeh was killed along with her husband, Farid Jama Suleiman, and at least 24 others after a bomb exploded outside the Asasey Hotel. Like my father, politics was of no interest to her. Integration TV, an online media platform she founded, aimed to showcase a different side of a nation that has been consistently the butt of every joke regarding failed states. She wanted to show the resilience of the Somali people \u2013 if they can live through a war, they can live through the barbaric antics of al-Shabaab, a group that claims to be Muslim yet regularly kills those of the same faith. Sound familiar? That may well be because they have aligned themselves with Isis. It is no secret that journalism can get you killed in Somalia. Nalayeh\u2019s death symbolises the threat journalists are to al-Shabaab. Even media workers who steer clear of politics portray a people trying to survive and move forward under a cloud of death and destruction. Nalayeh\u2019s depiction of communities that wake up each morning knowing it may be their last sends out a message to these cowards that you may kill many, but you will never take away our traditions. This scares al-Shabaab. My hope is that Nalayeh\u2019s passing will not be in vain. Somali journalists will carry on her legacy; one of peace, respect and the integrity Somalia and its people deserve. The time of her death comes amid a focus on refugees, and Somalis in particular. It is worth remembering that the \u201ccrime-infested failed state\u201d, as Donald Trump labelled this country, didn\u2019t occur in a vacuum. It is also worth remembering that in an increasingly divisive world, those who chant \u201csend them back\u201d, or \u201cbuild that wall\u201d, support governments that made people flee the countries they never wanted to leave. The sheer hypocrisy is astounding. Nalayeh \u201cwent back\u201d to show that Somali people are not the poster children for poverty and desperation, but a proud society that wants and deserves what everyone on this planet wants: a better life. \u2022 Noor Ibrahim is the pseudonym for an academic and writer based in Melbourne \u2022 Comments on this article have been pre-moderated to ensure the discussion is on the topics that have been written about in the article",

Ray Lawler\u2019s play about imploding personal and national ideas of mateship, loyalty and family has been performed more than 1,000 times. It is regularly an assigned literary text in Australian high schools and universities, and it paved the way for a storytelling identity in its image: Australian naturalism, the mundane tragedies of life, the personal and the domestic writ epic. And it all started when the Doll won the prestigious Playwrights\u2019 Advisory Board Competition prize in 1955.</p> <p>But it didn\u2019t win alone. Lawler\u2019s play actually tied with another one: The Torrents by Oriel Gray. The Doll is a national classic; The Torrents had, until this year, only been performed professionally once: in Adelaide in 1996. We can guess at all the reasons the industry chose to focus on the Doll and ignore The Torrents. Gray was a woman writer, first of all, a working mother in a conservative era and a one-time member of the Communist party. She wrote about racism in country Australia, feminism and environmental concerns \u2013 all things the country was collectively trying to ignore.

It is the first time since 2007 that Australia have held neither the World Cup nor Commonwealth Games title and while a one-goal loss may not seem hugely concerning to the world No 1-ranked team, context makes all the difference.</p> \n<p>Just like last year on the Gold Coast, the Diamonds sailed through the early stages of this tournament with ease, winning their first five games by an average margin of 58 goals. Commentators praised their ability to learn from their past failure by allowing more players to run out full games, but the lack of a settled combination stuck out like a sore thumb.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/21/australia-new-zealand-netball-world-cup-final-match-report\">New Zealand end 16-year wait to beat Australia in Netball World Cup final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of the eight matches the Diamonds played across the tournament, they used the same starting seven only twice \u2013 in both games against New Zealand. Importantly, in the semi-final against South Africa, captain Caitlin Bassett did not take to the court at all and preferred goal keeper Courtney Bruce only made an appearance in the final quarter. With a lack of court time as a combination in pressure matches, the Diamonds struggled to move as a cohesive unit when it mattered most.</p> \n<p>A big talking point prior to the tournament was the lack of a specialist wing defence selected. Of the four players who played the position at the World Cup, only one \u2013 Jamie-Lee Price \u2013 had played wing defence during the Super Netball season, and only for two quarters.</p> \n<p>Although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/11/wing-defence-the-most-underrated-and-influential-of-netball-positions\">wing defence is often regarded unimportant in Saturday junior games</a>, it is a highly specialised position at this level.

      "bodyText": "\u201cI don\u2019t think you have a knee jerk reaction automatically on a one-goal loss,\u201d said Diamonds\u2019 coach Lisa Alexander after her charges were again denied by the smallest of margins in the final of a major tournament. It is the first time since 2007 that Australia have held neither the World Cup nor Commonwealth Games title and while a one-goal loss may not seem hugely concerning to the world No 1-ranked team, context makes all the difference. Just like last year on the Gold Coast, the Diamonds sailed through the early stages of this tournament with ease, winning their first five games by an average margin of 58 goals. Commentators praised their ability to learn from their past failure by allowing more players to run out full games, but the lack of a settled combination stuck out like a sore thumb. Of the eight matches the Diamonds played across the tournament, they used the same starting seven only twice \u2013 in both games against New Zealand. Importantly, in the semi-final against South Africa, captain Caitlin Bassett did not take to the court at all and preferred goal keeper Courtney Bruce only made an appearance in the final quarter. With a lack of court time as a combination in pressure matches, the Diamonds struggled to move as a cohesive unit when it mattered most. A big talking point prior to the tournament was the lack of a specialist wing defence selected. Of the four players who played the position at the World Cup, only one \u2013 Jamie-Lee Price \u2013 had played wing defence during the Super Netball season, and only for two quarters. Although wing defence is often regarded unimportant in Saturday junior games, it is a highly specialised position at this level. Star wing defences Gabi Simpson and Ashleigh Brazill watched on from their lounge rooms back in Australia as the Diamonds struggled to find an answer in this position. The finalists\u2019 squads looked different in their make up. While seven of the Silver Ferns had experienced the bitter taste of silver in 2015, only three Diamonds took part in that campaign \u2013 and two of those did not play in the final. However, talk of the Ferns\u2019 experience was often seen as a euphemism for their ageing squad \u2013 one that would not have the legs to run out a gruelling 10-day tournament. But by Sunday night the three players who took the game out of Australia\u2019s hands were 32-year-old Maria Folau, 33-year-old Laura Langman and 34-year-old Casey Kopua, who was also named player of the match. This is the trio coach Noeline Taurua refers to as her \u201cfossils\u201d and it was their experience that sealed a gold medal. The Diamonds have been understandably quiet since the end of the match, but Alexander took to social media with a pointed retweet stating \u201cWhen the battle is over, loudest opinions come from those who\u2019ve watched from the sidelines. But their opinion does not count. The only person whose opinion counts is the one who is in the arena and risks all in fighting for the win. And that\u2019s you.\u201d Unfortunately for the Australian coach, there will be many opinions from outside the team that will count as dust settles on this World Cup. She is currently contracted until the end of 2020, but there is no doubt reviews will be conducted into where it all went wrong \u2013 from team selections to match day player management.

To walk away from not one, but two major tournaments in as many years without a gold medal is not simply about the individual losses themselves, but the years of planning that go into ensuring the team peaks at the right time. After Alexander\u2019s post-match interview, former Diamonds\u2019 goal attack and three-time world champion Nat Medhurst was not buying into the minimisation of the situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not a knee jerk reaction because they lost last year as well,\u201d Medhurst said. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that has been happening for around the last 12 to 18 months. It\u2019s the flow on effect, because Australia \u2013 we don\u2019t want to be in this position. We want to be winning Comm Games, winning World Cups. It\u2019s not good enough.

      "bodyText": "Natalie Portman will take up the mantle of Thor in the upcoming Marvel sequel Thor: Love and Thunder, announced on Saturday. Stars Chris Hemsworth and Tessa Thompson, and director Taika Waititi, will also return from 2017\u2019s Thor: Ragnarok, and Portman will reprise her character of Dr Jane Foster, who debuted in the 2011 original. For fans confused by the character and gender shift, Waititi explained that the movie would be based on an existing 2014 comic book storyline where Thor loses his abilities and Jane Foster wields his powers and magical hammer Mjolnir. Further details of the plot have not been released, but the New Zealand director clarified that her name would be Mighty Thor. And at the end of Hemsworth\u2019s most recent on-screen appearance in Avengers: Endgame, the character had left his role as ruler of Asgard to join the Guardians of the Galaxy team, and appointed Thompson\u2019s Valkyrie character as his replacement. Thor: Love and Thunder is the fourth instalment in the franchise, and Waititi\u2019s second time directing a Marvel film. Portman has not featured in a Thor franchise film since 2013\u2019s Thor: The Dark World, which was not well received critically. But Waititi\u2019s Marvel debut with Ragnarok was praised for injecting a newfound sense of humour and style into the ailing franchise. Portman posted on Instagram that she was \u201cthrilled\u201d to return to the series and to work with Hemsworth and Thompson. \u201cRemember this as the before picture for when I get jacked,\u201d she joked. No details have been released about whether Tom Hiddleston, who portrayed Thor\u2019s brother Loki in the previous three films, would return. But Hiddleston was previously confirmed to feature in a new Marvel TV series, called Loki. Also announced on Saturday were a Black Widow film starring Scarlett Johansson, a sequel to Doctor Strange, a reboot of Blade starring Mahershala Ali, and Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings \u2013 Marvel\u2019s first Asian superhero film \u2013 starring Simu Liu and Awkwafina. Last week the James Bond franchise announced that female actor Lashanna Lynch would take over the mantle of agent 007 in the next film, with Daniel Craig also set to return as a retired James Bond.",

The Silver Ferns defeated old foes Australia in the Netball World Cup final in England in a thrilling match, which the New Zealand team won by a single point.</p> <p>In the final quarter of the nail-biting game, the Ferns managed to creep their lead out to four goals, however, in the dying minutes the Diamonds pulled it back to just one.</p> <p>Ecstatic New Zealand fans said the victory helped \u201cheal the wound\u201d of a \u201ccrushing defeat\u201d in the Cricket World Cup final to England last week.</p> <p>The disparity in the financial return for the two teams was not lost of New Zealanders, however.

      "bodyText": "What a difference a week makes. Seven days ago, New Zealand was in despair, mourning the loss of a Cricket World Cup final that will go down as one of the most dramatic in history. But on Monday the country awoke to news that swept away much of that grief. The Silver Ferns defeated old foes Australia in the Netball World Cup final in England in a thrilling match, which the New Zealand team won by a single point. In the final quarter of the nail-biting game, the Ferns managed to creep their lead out to four goals, however, in the dying minutes the Diamonds pulled it back to just one. Ecstatic New Zealand fans said the victory helped \u201cheal the wound\u201d of a \u201ccrushing defeat\u201d in the Cricket World Cup final to England last week. The disparity in the financial return for the two teams was not lost of New Zealanders, however. The Black Caps cricket team pocketed $3m for coming second, whereas there is no prize money for the Netball World Cup, and the Silver Ferns will likely get nothing for their win. New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, was up at 4am New Zealand time to watch the final. \u201cThe Silver Ferns deserve huge recognition for not only that final, but for their World Cup performance,\u201d she said. \u201cYou could see their heart and soul went into that last match and the whole tournament. It was an amazing final to watch.\u201d New Zealand national cricket veteran Ross Taylor passed on his congratulations. The All Blacks rugby team also made their support known as they flew back from a Test match against Argentina. Team members were photographed standing around Sam Cane\u2019s smartphone, so they could watch a live stream of the match. Veteran Silver Fern Casey Kopua, whose intercept with nine minutes left on the clock helped secure the team\u2019s victory, held her three-year-old daughter Maia, while being awarded player of the match. \u201cWhen you\u2019ve got the belief like that, there\u2019s nothing that can stop you,\u201d said Kopua, who, at 34, is a self-described \u201cfossil\u201d of the team, as Maia started licking sweat off her mother\u2019s shoulder, in an interview that sparked delight online. Kopua and fellow veteran Laura Langman confirmed that they are retiring from international competition after the match, having both debuted internationally back in 2005 \u2013 two years after the Silver Ferns\u2019 last World Cup win. In another post-match response that delighted fans, Langman said she hadn\u2019t decided how to celebrate yet, but was going to start by having a few biscuits. Last year, Netball New Zealand were forced to do some soul-searching after slumping to fourth in the Commonwealth Games. Management installed Noeline Taurua, herself a former Silver Fern, as coach, but controversially just hired her on a part-time basis. In the build up to the tournament she continued to coach Sunshine Coast Lightning in Super Netball, Australia\u2019s domestic competition.",

I would need to change and become one of those obnoxious people who can afford to have a lifestyle epiphany. I would de-stress. Find balance. Smell the roses, and then write about it.</p> <p>And so my twice-weekly yoga became daily exercises. I stopped drinking coffee after midday, if at all, and I cut back on red wine.</p> <p>I downloaded a meditation app that piped in the sounds I was aching most to hear: rain on a tin roof, raucous birdsong, the ocean surging.</p> <p>I focused on my breathing and I made sure I got enough sunlight. I ate wholefoods, for crying out loud, and I may have purchased green tea.</p> <p>And it wasn\u2019t as if this stuff didn\u2019t help, because in a way it did. It helped to sustain my freelance lifestyle and it kept me functioning. But functioning was my problem. I was functioning my arse off. I needed to function less.</p> <p>So when my partner came home one day and told me about a series of commissions he had secured up north, I suggested we jump in the car and just go there. As in right now. This afternoon. Let\u2019s take the dog, I said, and we can both work remotely.</p> <p>And off we went, north through the hardscrabble farming country of Victoria\u2019s interior to the vivid greenery of the superannuated southern highlands into the epicentre of anti-vaxxer counter-culture of northern NSW and, finally, on to a jerry-built, dog-friendly rental in the Sunshine Coast hinterland.</p> <p>Along the way, I ate terrible/great roadside food and drank middling pinot noir with my lunch. I didn\u2019t do any exercise other than walking in the local parks, and I stopped counting daily steps.</p> <p>Each day I woke to the sound of the sea, or the wind in the trees, or some other natural sound that I used to download on my smartphone.</p> <p>I listened to all the music and watched all the TV shows and read all the books that I had loved as a child and, gradually, I found my way back to myself.

My body was exhibiting strange symptoms in the form of heart palpitations and unexplained pains. Furthermore, I found it impossible to relax. My mind was snagged on the same punishing loop of work and deadlines and \u201cwhat\u2019s next? what\u2019s next?\u201d and I had forgotten how to just be. My GP insisted it was stress, but I was so arrogantly sure of my preternatural ability to push through, to get stuff done, that it took a lot of negative test results to concede my workaholism was making me ill. I would need to change and become one of those obnoxious people who can afford to have a lifestyle epiphany. I would de-stress. Find balance. Smell the roses, and then write about it. And so my twice-weekly yoga became daily exercises. I stopped drinking coffee after midday, if at all, and I cut back on red wine. I downloaded a meditation app that piped in the sounds I was aching most to hear: rain on a tin roof, raucous birdsong, the ocean surging. I focused on my breathing and I made sure I got enough sunlight. I ate wholefoods, for crying out loud, and I may have purchased green tea. And it wasn\u2019t as if this stuff didn\u2019t help, because in a way it did. It helped to sustain my freelance lifestyle and it kept me functioning. But functioning was my problem. I was functioning my arse off. I needed to function less. So when my partner came home one day and told me about a series of commissions he had secured up north, I suggested we jump in the car and just go there. As in right now. This afternoon. Let\u2019s take the dog, I said, and we can both work remotely. And off we went, north through the hardscrabble farming country of Victoria\u2019s interior to the vivid greenery of the superannuated southern highlands into the epicentre of anti-vaxxer counter-culture of northern NSW and, finally, on to a jerry-built, dog-friendly rental in the Sunshine Coast hinterland. Along the way, I ate terrible/great roadside food and drank middling pinot noir with my lunch. I didn\u2019t do any exercise other than walking in the local parks, and I stopped counting daily steps. Each day I woke to the sound of the sea, or the wind in the trees, or some other natural sound that I used to download on my smartphone. I listened to all the music and watched all the TV shows and read all the books that I had loved as a child and, gradually, I found my way back to myself. My heart rate slowed. The fog cleared. In a recent article on her sudden move to rural Greece, Brisbane writer Susan Johnson gorgeously refers to this shedding of skin as \u201cslipping the net\u201d. My road trip north was my version of that freedom, of going off-course so that I may eventually return to the busy thoroughfare of life, not a different person exactly, but not entirely the same either. I don\u2019t doubt that daily yoga or meditation can be life-changing for many, but there is far from one prescribed path to transforming your life or looking after your wellbeing. We all want a life we don\u2019t need regular health retreats and breaks from in order to withstand. And finding that life \u2013 and the unsteady, ungainly process of that task \u2013 looks different for everyone. What I discovered was that leaving my problems behind for a little while, indulging in empty pleasure and ignoring popular wellness advice was the salve my soul needed. \u2022 Johanna Leggatt is a freelance journalist",

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s your match report: \u201cNot everyone wants Liverpool to win,\u201d protests Gloria Greppi. No, but no one wants to see the sort of injury that was inflicted on Larouci tonight, and it seems a failure of karma that Sevilla scored a late winner. No matter -- Liverpool will move on with its preseason tour before welcoming its star players for the start of the season proper next month. They may wonder why they can\u2019t do well whenever they visit their corporate brethren in Boston, but they have bigger trophies to chase and defend. Thanks for following along with us tonight, and if you\u2019re in the USA, may your air conditioning hold out for another week or so. If this were a Champions League game, Liverpool fans would worry about the result. But it\u2019s a friendly, which means they\u2019ll just worry about the injury to Larouci on a horror tackle. And they\u2019ll worry about their defense, which looked as shaky as it did before Liverpool broke open the wallets to shore things up at the back. 90 +4 min: Good ball in from Ryan Kent, and the Sevilla keeper fools no one by pretending to be injured on the routine catch. Boston/Liverpool fans are having none of it. 90+2 min: We\u2019re into the second minute of a promised five, and Joe Gomez flings a throw-in well into the area. Direct ball, Liverpool apparently can\u2019t locate a right back, the ball is quickly crossed, and Mignolet can do nothing to prevent an unworthy result. 89 min: A bit of optimism here for Liverpool ... 87 min: El Haddadi sweeps the leg on Duncan. Liverpool might be happy to get out of this without another injury. In the first half, the commentators were complaining a bit much, but Sevilla have gone out for blood in the second half. 85 min: Sevilla have switched to the traditional 8-1-0 formation. Liverpool impressively pass around the defenders but can\u2019t create a decent chance. 82 min: And yet, Liverpool\u2019s defense have not impressed here. Young left back Adam Lewis has to scramble to keep a cross from being turned in from five years out. 80 min: Bobby Duncan will get a few minutes here under the sad circumstances of the Larouci injury. We\u2019re back underway, and play is all in Sevilla\u2019s half. Joris Gnagnon is sent off for for an MMA/kickboxing-style kick to Larouci\u2019s leg. The crowd groans with two replays of the incident. Gnagnon apparently hasn\u2019t looked, as he spends a while arguing with the ref. The stretcher has come out for Larouci. It was a simply outrageous play. 73 min: Liverpool are off to the races, with Ryan Kent slaloming through the midfield and handing it off to Milner, who plays ahead for Jones. The young Liverpool prospect doesn\u2019t have a great shooting angle, so he plays it back to Milner, whose shot is blocked. 70 min: Liverpool defender Ki-Jana Hoever gets the worst of an aerial collision and is down for treatment. The referee decides it\u2019s a good time for a water break. 69 min: Chance for Curtis Jones, who brings the ball down nicely at the corner of the goal area and immediately shoots. Tom\u00e1\u0161 Vacl\u00edk, Sevilla\u2019s entrenched starter in goal, makes the solid close-range save. 65 min: The Liverpool youngsters -- Larouci, Curtis Jones, Ryan Kent and Adam Lewis -- have strung together a few passing combinations. Not quite breaking through, but it\u2019s engaging and may eventually lead somewhere. 62 min: But after bringing on a strong attacker, Sevilla go on the defensive, packing eight players at the top of the area. Liverpool still win a corner and then regain possession. It\u2019s Yasser Larouci who ends up with the ball, and like Kent, he shows off his capacity to make a strong run forward but might consider sending the ball elsewhere before running into trouble. 60 min: Two more changes for Sevilla, taking out two players carried over from the second half (Ocampos, Jordan), and bringing on leading scorer Wissam Ben Yedder. 58 min: Mignolet is called into action again, this time on a corner kick floating to an awkward spot near the back post. Sevilla are simply picking apart the Liverpool defense at the moment. 55 min: Two big saves by Mignolet! Sevilla break forward, and El Haddadi takes a powerful shot from the top of the area. Mignolet parries. The rebound goes to Vazquez, whose shot is a little tamer and is smothered by the Liverpool keeper. 52 min: Ryan Kent makes a strong run between two defenders, one of whom decides he must be held back. Liverpool take advantage of the free kick to knock the ball around at the back. It\u2019s a possession drill. 51 min: At last, confirmation that Banega\u2019s evening is finished. 50 min: Ian Copestake has some insight into Sevilla\u2019s substitutions: \u201cYou may see Klopp come on in the second half to take out Banega himself.\u201d I\u2019d have to think Banega would have been sent off if this weren\u2019t a friendly in which the ref was pretty sure Banega was leaving at halftime, anyway. might as well let Sevilla play with 11 in the second half. Ocampos has NOT left the field, and Milner slides to block his shot at uncomfortably close range. 46 min: We\u2019re underway and desperately hoping Sevilla\u2019s Twitter feed informs us of their lineup changes. Liverpool\u2019s second-half lineup Only 11. Fair enough. They can probably afford to keep him. Everyone ready for waves of halftime subs? It\u2019ll take a while for us to get to them all. Lonergan makes another save as a ball caroms to Ocampos, 20 yards out. That\u2019s the last kick of the game. We have confirmation that Wilson scored the goal against Borussia Dortmund: 45+1 min: We\u2019ll get two minutes of added time, which is considerably shorter than the water break actually was. Wilson cuts in from the right to unleash a powerful shot, but he\u2019s developing a tendency of smacking the ball straight into defenders. Then Wilson gets a nice unnecessary slap in the face from Banega as they race along the touchline. Banega may be lucky not to get a second yellow. Our announcers say a few unpleasant things about South Americans. You can\u2019t say that was coming, because it wasn\u2019t. It\u2019s a scrappy set piece, with Alexander-Arnold\u2019s corner kick finding the head of the rising Phillips. The ball bounds up into a Sevilla defender\u2019s arm, but it\u2019s safe to say Liverpool won\u2019t argue with the referee allowing play to continue another second for the unmarked Origi to thump the ball into the net. The crowd chant Origi\u2019s name. 43 min: My theory of the half so far is that the teams have opted to play in Liverpool\u2019s half because it\u2019s in the shade. Jon Faris writes: \u201cI was at the match Friday. Wilson was wrongly credited with a goal, #40, Kent scored the goal. The announcer corrected himself after wrongly crediting Wilson, but, at halftime and after fulltime, Wilson was again wrongly credited. Granted Kent will not make the big club, but cut the kid some slack will ya? It may just be the highlight of his career.\u201d Did anyone writing about the match make the correction? 41 min: Liverpool\u2019s second-half players must be relishing the chance to make an impression here. Nolito\u2019s stay at Manchester City included a quip about the weather changing the color of his daughter\u2019s face. He didn\u2019t stay long. Liverpool\u2019s defense watches a cross roll through the area to Nolito, who curls a powerful shot into the top corner. Can\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t coming. 35 min: Booking for Diego Carlos for swinging his arms back into a Liverpool player\u2019s face. The free kick from 45 yards out is cleared, and Wijnaldum is brought down as he attempts to keep the ball in Sevilla\u2019s half. Van Dijk responds with a hard challenge of his own, and he also sees yellow. 33 min: Terrific control from Nolito, bringing down a long pass at the left side of the area, but his quick cross sails over de Jong\u2019s head. Liverpool have had maybe one half-chance in the last 20 minutes. 30 min: We resume with a Sevilla free kick and an offside call. The green in the numbers on Liverpool\u2019s new third kit roughly match the goalkeeping kit. 26 min: Water time. Did we mention the heat? Even the grass is taking on some water, thanks to some sprinklers and a few folks with hoses. And this has gone on for a couple of minutes now ... 24 min: Liverpool awaken and go storming the other way, with Andy Robertson finding space on the left and Jordan Henderson pouncing on a poor clearance. It\u2019s a pity most of these players will depart at the half. We\u2019re seeing some promising attacks here. 23 min: Free kick for Sevilla, headed clear by Phillips but not too far, and the ball is played back into de Jong, whose header goes just wide. The first five minutes belonged to Liverpool. The next 18 minutes have not. 21 min: Sevilla with a strong, patient buildup, switching play to their left and then centering. Many of these players are new to the club, but they\u2019ve figured out some intriguing combinations. 19 min: A decent spell of possession for the Reds, er, Navy-and-Green, but Sevilla keep them at bay. 16 min: Ball played in to Ocampos, whose first touch knocks the ball straight up into his own hand. Another whistle, and another adventure in playing the ball out of the back for Liverpool. 13 min: And it\u2019s a big save for Lonergan after some comical defending from Liverpool. A giveaway at the edge of the area, then a pass slipped through a defender\u2019s legs, and it\u2019s Lonergan making himself big at point-blank range. And another failure to play out of the back gives Ocampos a chance, which he puts just outside Lonergan\u2019s right post. Well now. This won\u2019t be as easy as it seemed in the first five minutes. 11 min: A foul, a whistle, and a spike that sends the ball flying about 30 feet in the air. The latter earns Argentine defender Ever Banega a booking. Replay shows the challenge was rather brutal. Our announcers say he\u2019ll think he won the ball, but that doesn\u2019t matter if you also smack into someone\u2019s ankle. 10 min: If you were thinking the heat would lead to a patient match, you\u2019re mistaken. De Jong finds space against van Dijk but makes a mess of the half-chance. In fairness, most of the players out here now will be removed from the game at halftime. 8 min: Harry Wilson takes a free kick straight into the wall -- or at least a Sevilla player who has jumped a bit in front of where the wall was supposed to be. Our observant referee asks for a retake, and Wilson duly thumps it into the wall again. 6 min: Chance for Sevilla, and it\u2019s defender Diego Carlos finding far too much space on a corner kick. He\u2019ll be disappointed with that header, and Jurgen Klopp will be disappointed with the defending. 5 min: It\u2019s a touch for Andy Lonergan, as Wijnaldum takes it backward and the defense take it further back. Andy Lonergan is not to be confused with Mark Lanegan, lead singer of Seattle band Screaming Trees. 4 min: Chance for Liverpool as Divock Origi scotts past the defense but can only put his shot at Sergio Rico. The ensuing corner is uneventful, but Sevilla look shaky. Our man Joe Pearson checks in: \u201cWhere is this on the TV dial? Bleacher Report says TNT, but that sure looks like \u201cSnow White\u201d to me. Help!\u201d Priorities, priorities. You\u2019ll need to go to Bleacher Report Live. They have apps for a couple of different platforms. 1 min: Chance for Liverpool. No surprise -- it\u2019s Trent Alexander-Arnold across the mouth of the goal. We\u2019re off, and the camera looks like it\u2019s perched on a blimp. You might know Sevilla\u2019s coach A few hints ... He was Spain\u2019s head coach heading into the 2018 World Cup, until he wasn\u2019t. He was fired after announcing he was headed to Real Madrid. His stay at Real Madrid was shorter than some summer camps. Yes, it\u2019s Julen Lopetegui. Think he\u2019s motivated to get Sevilla into the Champions League? Excessive heat warning ... Current temperature is 93 degrees, and the National Weather Service has warned everyone in Boston about it. In Celsius, that\u2019s 34 degrees. That doesn\u2019t sound any better. Funny how 32 degrees is the threshold for \u201ctoo cold\u201d in Fahrenheit and \u201ctoo hot\u201d in Celsius. Such symmetry. How do you turn a baseball stadium into a proper football ground? Very carefully ... In the old days of the NASL, they didn\u2019t even bother to cover the dirt. Why is this game at hallowed baseball stadium Fenway Park? Corporate synergy. The Boston Red Sox, which endured generations of frustration before winning the World Series so often in the past 15 years that it\u2019s become boring, are owned by Fenway Sports Group. Guess which European champion football club Fenway Sports Group also owns? So, yes, Fenway Sports Group has been rather successful in the past nine months: If you don\u2019t know Fenway Park, it\u2019s one of those old stadiums that has such a wonderful history that people don\u2019t mind its quirks. Left field is short but prevents easy home runs with the \u201cGreen Monster,\u201d a tall edifice upon which many a baseball has bounced. It\u2019s an odd fit for football, but this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve seen a game there. The park also has hosted a snowboarding \u201cbig air\u201d competition. The perennial top-half finishers in La Liga have had a major makeover this season. The defense was reinforced with a pair of centre backs from Ligue 1 -- Jules Kounde (Bordeaux) and Diego Carlos (Nantes). A few new attacking players will compete to fill the hole left by Pablo Sarabia, who left for PSG. Sevilla: Sergio Rico, Jes\u00fas Navas, Diego Carlos, Carri\u00e7o, Reguil\u00f3n, Fernando, Jord\u00e1n, Banega, Ocampos, Nolito, de Jong Jord\u00e1n (ex-Eibar), Ocampos (ex-Marseille) and De Jong (ex-PSV) are the newcomers to watch in attack, while goalkeeper Sergio Rico has returned from a loan spell with Fulham. It\u2019s interesting, especially the inclusion of goalkeeper Andy Lonergan. You\u2019d think the 35-year-old goalkeeper would be here just in case of emergency and that Liverpool would rather look at one of their youngsters instead, but the veteran of roughly a dozen English clubs gets the start tonight. Other than that, most of the starters will look familiar to anyone who watched Liverpool last season. Welsh winger Harry Wilson, an academy alumnus who scored against Borussia Dortmund a few nights ago, will start again. Liverpool: Lonergan, Alexander-Arnold, Phillips, van Dijk, Robertson, Wijnaldum, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Henderson, Woodburn, Wilson, Origi The players who have been busy with continental championships -- Allison, Salah, Firmino and Mane -- are not here. Naby Keita and Shaqiri haven\u2019t been traveling due to injury. Good evening to all in the UK, good afternoon to all in the USA, and thank you for joining us if you live elsewhere. If you\u2019re in the USA and have not yet downloaded Bleacher Report Live to the device of your choosing, then do so now if you want to watch the game. We\u2019ll wait ... Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s Andy Hunter\u2019s pick of the Liverpool players to watch on their pre-season tour: With Sadio Man\u00e9 still involved in the Africa Cup of Nations, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino only just beginning their holidays after international duty and Xherdan Shaqiri injured, Bobby Duncan will get his chance to impress on the US tour, alongside the highly-rated 19-year-old, Rhian Brewster. Duncan formed a prolific strike partnership with Paul Glatzel for the under-18s last season, scoring more than 60 goals in total including the equaliser against Manchester City in the FA Youth Cup final (Duncan) and the winning penalty in the shootout (Glatzel). Duncan won\u2019t be joined by his prolific strike partner, who picked up a knee injury in the friendly win over Tranmere. AH And here\u2019s reaction from another pre-season friendly, won by Harry Kane with an outrageous goal from the halfway line:",

It drew on data from the <a href=\"https://cls.ucl.ac.uk/cls-studies/millennium-cohort-study/\">Millennium Cohort Study</a>, which follows the lives of about 19,000 teenagers born across the UK in 2000-01.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/19/special-needs-support-school-send-cuts\">I had special needs help in school.

The study found that, at age 11, two-thirds of children with ASD reported being involved in some form of sibling bullying, compared with half of children without autism.</p> <p>While bullying got less frequent for children in both groups by the time they reached 14, autistic children were still more likely to be involved in two-way sibling bullying.</p> <p>Lead author of the study, Dr Umar Toseeb from the University of York, pointed out that the research went beyond the usual sibling squabbling that was a normal part of growing up, but looked at children who had persistent conflict with their siblings.</p> <p>He said: \u201cChildren with autism experience difficulties with social interaction and communication, which may have implications for their relationships with siblings.\u201d</p> <p>While other studies have shown that siblings are likely to speak positively of their relationship with their brother or sister with autism, Toseeb said it was natural for siblings to compete for attention in families, especially when one child had higher needs and was therefore maybe getting more time from parents.</p> <p>He said: \u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, siblings may be considered competitors for parental resources such as affection, attention and material goods \u2013 children with autism might get priority access to these limited parental resources leading to conflict and bullying between siblings.\u201d</p> <p>The parents of the children involved in the study were asked questions about their children\u2019s emotional and behavioural difficulties, focusing on things like whether their child was unhappy, downhearted and restless.</p> <p>According to the research, those children who had picked on or been bullied by a sibling, regardless of whether they had autism or not, were more likely to experience emotional and behavioural difficulties later in their adolescence.</p> <p>Researchers are calling for more resources to help autistic children and their parents identify and deal with bullying behaviours in the home, particularly earlier in childhood.</p> <p>Toseeb said: \u201cParents should be aware of the potential long-term consequences of sibling bullying on children\u2019s mental health and wellbeing.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 July 2019 to clarify that the word \u201cneurotypical\u201d was used by researchers to indicate participants without ASD.</p>",

Researchers also found that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are more likely to be both the victims and perpetrators of sibling bullying compared with those without autism, referred to in the study as \u201cneurotypical\u201d children. The study, a rare piece of research investigating sibling bullying and autism, used a sample of more than 8,000 kids, more than 231 of whom had ASD. It drew on data from the Millennium Cohort Study, which follows the lives of about 19,000 teenagers born across the UK in 2000-01. The children were asked how often they were picked on or hurt on purpose by their brothers or sisters and peers, and how often they were the perpetrators of such acts. The study found that, at age 11, two-thirds of children with ASD reported being involved in some form of sibling bullying, compared with half of children without autism. While bullying got less frequent for children in both groups by the time they reached 14, autistic children were still more likely to be involved in two-way sibling bullying. Lead author of the study, Dr Umar Toseeb from the University of York, pointed out that the research went beyond the usual sibling squabbling that was a normal part of growing up, but looked at children who had persistent conflict with their siblings. He said: \u201cChildren with autism experience difficulties with social interaction and communication, which may have implications for their relationships with siblings.\u201d While other studies have shown that siblings are likely to speak positively of their relationship with their brother or sister with autism, Toseeb said it was natural for siblings to compete for attention in families, especially when one child had higher needs and was therefore maybe getting more time from parents. He said: \u201cFrom an evolutionary perspective, siblings may be considered competitors for parental resources such as affection, attention and material goods \u2013 children with autism might get priority access to these limited parental resources leading to conflict and bullying between siblings.\u201d The parents of the children involved in the study were asked questions about their children\u2019s emotional and behavioural difficulties, focusing on things like whether their child was unhappy, downhearted and restless. According to the research, those children who had picked on or been bullied by a sibling, regardless of whether they had autism or not, were more likely to experience emotional and behavioural difficulties later in their adolescence. Researchers are calling for more resources to help autistic children and their parents identify and deal with bullying behaviours in the home, particularly earlier in childhood. Toseeb said: \u201cParents should be aware of the potential long-term consequences of sibling bullying on children\u2019s mental health and wellbeing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 July 2019 to clarify that the word \u201cneurotypical\u201d was used by researchers to indicate participants without ASD.",
