Three-quarters of support professionals such as health visitors and social workers said they had seen an increase in the numbers of families they regularly worked with who experienced destitution and were in need of basic financial support. Despite more families facing greater difficulties, official support was harder to come by, the survey found. \u201cThe only substantive increase in support over the last year was the increase in the number of families support workers have seen using food banks,\u201d it read. The survey of 1,290 frontline family support workers from 616 organisations across the UK was published by the poverty grants charity Buttle UK. It said it was undertaken to provide a \u201cthermometer reading\u201d of the lives of some the UK\u2019s most vulnerable families. It comes amid rising concern that alongside headline increases in relative poverty in recent years \u2013 more than 4 million children in the UK live below the breadline \u2013 a cohort of the very poorest families is experiencing the extreme and intractable form of poverty known as destitution. Destitution is defined as experience of at least two of six measures over the previous month, including eating fewer than two meals a day for two or more days; or as a weekly income after housing costs of \u00a370 for a single adult or \u00a3140 for a couple with children \u2013 an amount below which people \u201ccannot meet their core material needs for basic physiological functioning from their own resources\u201d. Last week, the MPs Frank Field and Heidi Allen warned that austerity cuts meant that the poorest communities were now \u201cblighted by the constant spectre of destitution\u201d. An estimated 1.5 million people in the UK, including 350,00 children, experienced destitution in 2017.

      "body": "<p>Half of all law centres and not-for-profit legal advice services in England and Wales have closed over the past six years, according to government figures.</p> <p>The scale of the reduction, caused by deep cuts to both legal aid and local authority funding, is revealed in figures <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2019-07-04/273435/\">obtained through parliamentary questions</a>.</p> <p>In 2013-14 there were 94 local areas with law centres or agencies offering free legal services, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed. By this year, 2019-20, the number had fallen to just 47.</p> <p>The figures were given in answer to questions by Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary. They also reveal that, between 2010-11 and 2018-19, MoJ funding for law centres through legal aid contracts dropped from \u00a312.1m to \u00a37.1m.</p> <p>The impact was caused by a double blow because removal of legal aid eligibility for many types of cases coincided with a financial crisis among local authorities, which have been forced to withdraw support for local law centres.</p> <p>Burgon, the Leeds East MP, said: \u201cDeliberately undermining law centres in this way is yet another indictment of the Tories\u2019 shameful record on justice.</p> <p>\u201cThe weakening of law centres and legal aid is part of the same austerity agenda that has inflicted such damage on working-class communities. These cuts leave people without the legal support they need to fight back against their services being slashed and their rights being trampled on. That\u2019s not a by-product, but the actual aim of cruel Tory policies that restrict access to justice.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/07/deaths-police-custody-sean-rigg\">Justice is a right \u2013 not something grieving families need to crowdfund | Kieran Yates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Burgon, who was visiting a law centre in south London as part of a campaign by the all-party parliamentary group on legal aid, added: \u201cLabour is committed to investing in law centres so that communities can once again defend their hard-won rights and take on the dodgy landlords, unscrupulous bosses and other exploitative people in positions of power that benefit from the hollowing out of our legal aid system.\u201d</p> <p>The party said it would build more law centres if it won the next election.</p> <p>Julie Bishop, director of the Law Centres Network, warned that several more law centres were in a \u201cprecarious\u201d state and likely to close soon. She said there were about 40 independent law centres surviving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with at least 11 having closed since the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act sliced about \u00a3950m off the annual legal aid budget.</p> <p>Bishop said: \u201cA lot of smaller aid agencies and Citizens Advice bureaux have withdrawn from providing legal services. There\u2019s been a real shrinkage.</p> <p>\u201cWe are anticipating that a couple of other law centres may close. Local authorities have been cut massively and they have withdrawn funding from the sector.

      "bodyText": "Half of all law centres and not-for-profit legal advice services in England and Wales have closed over the past six years, according to government figures. The scale of the reduction, caused by deep cuts to both legal aid and local authority funding, is revealed in figures obtained through parliamentary questions. In 2013-14 there were 94 local areas with law centres or agencies offering free legal services, the Ministry of Justice has confirmed. By this year, 2019-20, the number had fallen to just 47. The figures were given in answer to questions by Richard Burgon, the shadow justice secretary. They also reveal that, between 2010-11 and 2018-19, MoJ funding for law centres through legal aid contracts dropped from \u00a312.1m to \u00a37.1m. The impact was caused by a double blow because removal of legal aid eligibility for many types of cases coincided with a financial crisis among local authorities, which have been forced to withdraw support for local law centres. Burgon, the Leeds East MP, said: \u201cDeliberately undermining law centres in this way is yet another indictment of the Tories\u2019 shameful record on justice. \u201cThe weakening of law centres and legal aid is part of the same austerity agenda that has inflicted such damage on working-class communities. These cuts leave people without the legal support they need to fight back against their services being slashed and their rights being trampled on. That\u2019s not a by-product, but the actual aim of cruel Tory policies that restrict access to justice.\u201d Burgon, who was visiting a law centre in south London as part of a campaign by the all-party parliamentary group on legal aid, added: \u201cLabour is committed to investing in law centres so that communities can once again defend their hard-won rights and take on the dodgy landlords, unscrupulous bosses and other exploitative people in positions of power that benefit from the hollowing out of our legal aid system.\u201d The party said it would build more law centres if it won the next election. Julie Bishop, director of the Law Centres Network, warned that several more law centres were in a \u201cprecarious\u201d state and likely to close soon. She said there were about 40 independent law centres surviving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, with at least 11 having closed since the 2012 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (Laspo) Act sliced about \u00a3950m off the annual legal aid budget. Bishop said: \u201cA lot of smaller aid agencies and Citizens Advice bureaux have withdrawn from providing legal services. There\u2019s been a real shrinkage. \u201cWe are anticipating that a couple of other law centres may close. Local authorities have been cut massively and they have withdrawn funding from the sector. People cannot get access to legal help and demand continues to grow. \u201cWe have 1.5 million people living in destitution. Law centres say they have not seen it so bad in terms of people\u2019s situations after nine years of austerity.\u201d The MoJ provided transitional funding for law centres following the Laspo cuts. Its figures record that the number of advice services increased in 2013 but then reduced significantly thereafter. In his written answer, the justice minister Paul Maynard said the MoJ was investing up to \u00a35m to \u201cdeliver innovative services \u2026 offering support to people with social welfare problems like housing, including an expansion of early legal advice to determine the most effective solutions\u201d. The Law Centres Network was one of the charities supported by the Guardian in its Christmas appeal last year. Earlier this year the Guardian revealed that more than half of all magistrates courts in England and Wales have closed since 2010. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \u201cEvery person should have access to legal advice when they need it \u2013 that\u2019s why the Legal Aid Agency keeps availability under constant review and takes urgent actions whenever it has concerns. \u201cWe spent \u00a31.6bn on legal aid last year and in addition to the Civil Legal Advice telephone service, we are investing \u00a35m in innovative technologies to help people access legal support wherever they are.\u201d The latest figures, the department cautioned, may reflect consolidation where law centres may have closed offices but continue to deal with large volumes of legal aid work.",

Retail parks appeared to buck the gloomy trend, however, with 0.1% more visitors than the previous June.</p> \n<p>The BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the figures amounted to a \u201csummer slump\u201d, adding:<em> </em>\u201cPoor footfall this June led to a significant fall in the sales figures for the month \u2026 Last year\u2019s World Cup and glorious sunshine set a high bar which 2019\u2019s slow consumer spending and Brexit uncertainty failed to live up to.\u201d</p> \n<p>However, June\u2019s decline represents a month-on-month improvement on May\u2019s figures, which recorded footfall down 3.5% on the same month in 2018 \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/10/high-street-visits-hit-six-year-low-as-brexit-uncertainty-deters-shoppers\">the worst figure recorded since January 2013</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"8113512b-8ee0-49dc-80d3-0b56df87e441\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What\u2019s the problem?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Physical retailers have been hit by a combination of changing habits, unseasonably warm weather, rising costs and broader economic problems. In 2018 Toys R Us, Maplin and Poundworld disappeared as a result.</p>\n    <p>In terms of habits, shoppers are switching to buying online. The likes of Amazon have an unfair advantage because they have a lower business rate bill, which holds down costs and enables online retailers to woo shoppers with low prices. Business rates are taxes, based on the value of commercial property, that are imposed on traditional retailers with physical stores.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>At the same time, there is a move away from buying \u2018stuff\u2019 as more people live in smaller homes and rent rather than buy. Those pressures have come just as rising labour and product costs, partly fuelled by Brexit, have coincided with economic and political uncertainty that has dampened consumer confidence.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What help do retailers need?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Retailers with a high-street presence want the government to change business rates. They also want more political certainty as the potential for a no deal Brexit means some are not only incurring additional costs for stockpiling goods but are unsure about the impact of tariffs after October 2019. Retailers also want more investment in town centres to help them adapt to changing trends, as well as a cut to high parking charges which they say put off shoppers.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the government doing?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In the October 2018 budget the government announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/26/budget-to-offer-business-rates-relief-for-small-shops\">some relief</a>&nbsp;on business rates for independent shopkeepers. It has also set up a \u00a3675m \u2018future high streets\u2019 fund under which local councils can bid for up to \u00a325m towards regeneration projects such as refurbishing local historic buildings and improving transport links. The fund will also pay for the creation of a high street taskforce to provide expertise and hands-on support to local areas.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What is the outlook in 2019?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Some retailers could go under. Weakened by a difficult Christmas \u2013 which accounts for the entire annual profits of many retailers, and with further Brexit wobbles to come \u2013 retailers are facing a tough 2019. Another rise in the national minimum wage in April and the falling value of the pound against the dollar, which is used to buy goods in the far east, have also added to costs and hit profits.</p>\n    <p><br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The high street is being rocked by changes in shopping habits as consumers shop online rather than visit local stores.

      "bodyText": "Shoppers deserted UK high streets during June as the washout weather and continuing Brexit uncertainty helped drive store visits down to a seven-year low for the month. The \u201csummer slump\u201d took a particularly heavy toll on high streets, with shopping centres also badly affected, according to the British Retail Consortium\u2019s (BRC) monthly footfall tracker for the period from 26 May to 29 June. The data will fuel fears that Britain\u2019s economy has come to a standstill, with fears of a no-deal Brexit prompting consumers to sit on their hands and put off non-essential purchases. Footfall across shopping areas fell by 2.9% during the period, up from a 0.9% decline in the same month last year. That is the lowest June figure recorded since 2012, the second consecutive month where every UK region recorded a decline in footfall. High streets were worst hit, with visits sliding by 4.5%, compared with a 0.1% rise in June 2018, when the World Cup and sunny weather prompted many people to snap up barbecues, garden items and impulse purchases. Shopping centres also recorded significantly fewer visits, as footfall fell 2.4% for the month. Retail parks appeared to buck the gloomy trend, however, with 0.1% more visitors than the previous June. The BRC chief executive, Helen Dickinson, said the figures amounted to a \u201csummer slump\u201d, adding: \u201cPoor footfall this June led to a significant fall in the sales figures for the month \u2026 Last year\u2019s World Cup and glorious sunshine set a high bar which 2019\u2019s slow consumer spending and Brexit uncertainty failed to live up to.\u201d However, June\u2019s decline represents a month-on-month improvement on May\u2019s figures, which recorded footfall down 3.5% on the same month in 2018 \u2013 the worst figure recorded since January 2013. The high street is being rocked by changes in shopping habits as consumers shop online rather than visit local stores. This trend is only likely to accelerate: the internet is expected to account for more than half of UK retail sales in 10 years\u2019 time, up from about a fifth at present, according to a report by the analysts Retail Economics for the law firm Womble Bond Dickinson earlier this month. Household names such as Monsoon, Debenhams, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look have resorted to an insolvency process known as a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) to close stores and seek lower rents. Arcadia, owner of Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Evans and Burtons, among others, has also agreed a CVA. Dickinson said high streets and shopping centres needed to invest in improving their \u201cconsumer experience\u201d if they wanted to see footfall numbers rise, but with little money in the pot to spend on such measures, the government must reform the \u201cbroken\u201d business rates system and give firms the means to make the necessary improvements. The latest data showed that the West Midlands region was worst affected, notching up a 6% year-on-year decline in shopper numbers. London took the smallest hit, down 0.6%. Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s marketing and insights director, said that while the numbers were disappointing, given the \u201cexceptional and ongoing disruptive political and economic period\u201d the UK was facing, coupled with the turmoil in the retail sector, \u201cwe might actually expect consumer activity to have taken an even greater hit\u201d. The BRC revealed last week that retail sales in June fell by their biggest margin since records began in the mid-1990s, prompting it to declare that clarity over Brexit was desperately needed because the continued risk of a no-deal outcome was damaging consumer confidence and forcing retailers to spend hundreds of millions of pounds on measures to minimise the impact. Meanwhile, the Office for National Statistics reported that UK GDP rose by 0.3% in May from a month earlier, although some economists claimed Britain remained on the cusp of its first quarterly contraction since 2012.",

Union leaders at the TUC said without strong guidelines and action at a local level, communities in industrial cities and towns could suffer. The report, based on research conducted by the New Economics Foundation thinktank, said the UK may be able to learn lessons from three places that had transformed themselves after going through difficult times: Bilbao in northern Spain, Eindhoven in Holland, and Iceland.

But when Rohr spoke before the game of Egypt as Algeria\u2019s \u201cArab brothers\u201d he was correctly defining the mood. The Egyptians in the crowd, at first, were clearly backing Algeria, who responded by joining in the chants and raising of lit mobile phones in the 22nd minute in recognition of Mohamed Aboutrika, the great former playmaker who wore 22 when leading Egypt to victory in the Cup of Nations the last time they hosted it, but is now in effect exiled from his homeland after being included on a terrorism watchlist.</p> <p>But that is where alliances and relationships start to become a little clouded. Three Algerian fans were arrested early in the tournament for carrying signs bearing messages relating to political events back in Algeria, suggesting a level of cooperation between Egyptian and Algerian authorities.</p> <p>When Ighalo equalised, though, there was an exchange of bottles between the Algerian and Egyptian sections. There was a rush to the fence between them and briefly it seemed something very serious might break out. As it was, everything calmed down quickly as security moved in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jul/14/algeria-v-nigeria-africa-cup-of-nations-semi-final-live\">Algeria 2-1 Nigeria: Africa Cup of Nations semi-final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the pitch Algeria came again.

As Rohr noted, Algeria are better balanced now than when Nigeria beat them in World Cup qualifying and here the plan to close the spaces for the wingers worked perfectly. The only issue was fitness but one last surge brought the winner.</p> <p>By the end the exchanges between rival fans were of applause. That, hopefully, bodes well for security around the final but there is bound to be some unease on the part of the authorities if, as expected, thousands more Algerians travel east for the game.

In between were thousands upon thousands of orange and blue seats and then, in the centre, either side of the press box, a few thousand locals who had bought tickets in the expectation Egypt would be here. The 75,000 capacity Cairo International Stadium was perhaps a fifth full. Algeria and Egypt have a ferocious rivalry, as the 2009 World Cup play-off between the sides, and then the brutal Cup of Nations semi-final in Benguela a few months later attest. But when Rohr spoke before the game of Egypt as Algeria\u2019s \u201cArab brothers\u201d he was correctly defining the mood. The Egyptians in the crowd, at first, were clearly backing Algeria, who responded by joining in the chants and raising of lit mobile phones in the 22nd minute in recognition of Mohamed Aboutrika, the great former playmaker who wore 22 when leading Egypt to victory in the Cup of Nations the last time they hosted it, but is now in effect exiled from his homeland after being included on a terrorism watchlist. But that is where alliances and relationships start to become a little clouded. Three Algerian fans were arrested early in the tournament for carrying signs bearing messages relating to political events back in Algeria, suggesting a level of cooperation between Egyptian and Algerian authorities. When Ighalo equalised, though, there was an exchange of bottles between the Algerian and Egyptian sections. There was a rush to the fence between them and briefly it seemed something very serious might break out. As it was, everything calmed down quickly as security moved in. On the pitch Algeria came again. Belmadi spoke of their \u201cgreat attitude and mental strength\u201d but the tactical improvement since he took the job less than a year ago has been remarkable. As Rohr noted, Algeria are better balanced now than when Nigeria beat them in World Cup qualifying and here the plan to close the spaces for the wingers worked perfectly. The only issue was fitness but one last surge brought the winner. By the end the exchanges between rival fans were of applause. That, hopefully, bodes well for security around the final but there is bound to be some unease on the part of the authorities if, as expected, thousands more Algerians travel east for the game. At least, though, there may be a sense of occasion befitting a final \u2013 and there is no doubt that on form and ability Algeria deserve to be there.",

India\u2019s space programmes have been hailed by nationalist prime minister Narendra Modi as a marker of the country\u2019s rising status as a global power. In March, Modi announced the successful test of the country\u2019s first space weapon, an anti-satellite missile. The missile test was criticised by Nasa, who warned it had created dangerous orbital debris. Monday\u2019s attempted launch follows Chandrayaan-1, India\u2019s first lunar mission in 2008, which helped confirm the presence of water on the moon, but did not land on the lunar surface.

There has never been a World Cup final like this.

England lost wickets steadily in their run chase, but were driven on to a dramatic final sprint-finish by a wonderful innings from Ben Stokes, who laid to rest a few of his demons.</p> \n<p>Stokes was briefly the nation\u2019s most recognisable cricketer last year, if only for having a drunken, violent night out in Bristol followed by a much-publicised day in court. Here he repaid the patience of his teammates many times over with a fine, hugely determined innings to take England to a last-ditch tie on the 50-over scores.</p> \n<p>And so we reached the the agony of that ending. With the Lord\u2019s shadows lengthening after seven weeks of competition, 48 matches and 22,410 runs scored, the final match would end with each team facing six balls to decide which would become world champions. Somehow, reaching out across the codes, the nation\u2019s cricketers had found a way to make it go to penalties. But then, this is England, land of bruised hopes and faded glory, a place where the desire to win global sporting tournaments is entirely out of kilter with the painful reality of falling short, of last ditch collapse, of cruel, arbitrary endings.</p> \n<p>In the stands the crowd was in a state of disrepair, sitting, standing, hugging, leaping, making strange noises.

Cuccinelli would not guarantee no parents would be separated from children.</p> <p>In Atlanta on Sunday, advocacy groups and legal observers kept an eye on the streets. One lawyer told the Guardian Ice agents were in Clayton county, just south of the city, at 5am. Members of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights met at its offices north of Atlanta, near the city\u2019s migrant corridor, hoping to stream operations on social media.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/oct/05/living-in-fear-every-single-day-as-immigration-raids-wreak-havoc\">Mario Guevara</a>, a reporter for Mundo Hispanico with more than 300,000 followers on Facebook, was out early. He found only one undocumented woman, selling tamales. In her few months in Atlanta she had never seen Ice agents. She intended to work as usual, regardless of \u201crumors\u201d of a raid.</p> <p>A legal observer with Project South told the Guardian: \u201cNo news is good news.\u201d According to legal and law enforcement sources, raids in Atlanta were likely to be spread through the week. One immigration attorney, Pamela Peynado Stewart, said one contact had been made on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cWe recently learned that four Ice officers knocked at a single mother\u2019s home on Friday at 8am for the sole purpose of arresting the mother and her two young children,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had no crimes but did have an order of deportation in absentia from a few years back.</p> <p>\u201cThe family states that the Ice officers left the home without making a single arrest and simply asked the mother to follow some instructions and appear at a supervision, which she fully intends on doing.\u201d</p> <p>In San Diego, Ice arrested 27 people in an \u201cenforcement surge\u201d over the last week, spokeswoman Lauren Mack told the Guardian. Twenty arrests were targeted and seven were considered \u201ccollateral\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/immigration/story/2019-07-12/ice-arrests-20-in-san-diego-as-part-of-a-week-long-operation\">meaning</a> they may not be subject to deportation.</p> <p>The arrests, Mack said, were not part of the raids Trump has promoted. Ice said 85% of those arrested had convictions or charges on their record, thereby suggesting it was detaining people with no criminal history.</p> <p>Such \u201ccollateral\u201d arrests added a new level of fear, said Sandra Cordero, director of Families Belong Together, based in Los Angeles: \u201cIt\u2019s really really dangerous, because it just terrifies an entire community and allies and folks who have not been targeted before. It\u2019s going to bring a lot of havoc to folks who happen to be in a location.\u201d</p> <p>Cordero said she had not heard reports of raids in LA but said communities were on high alert: \u201cPeople are doing what they can to protect themselves.\u201d</p> <p>In northern California, activists said there had not been any raids in the Bay Area. But fear had spread elsewhere. Ambar Tovar, United Farm Workers\u2019 directing attorney, said people were staying off the streets in the Central Valley, a region not on the rumored list of targets.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump administration is trying to instil fear and even if nothing happens he\u2019s accomplishing that,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are not willing to come out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7458f1763e5b5bf1ca38515e1a4206ea39bcb5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7458f1763e5b5bf1ca38515e1a4206ea39bcb5f/0_233_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Immigration rights activists talk in Miami, during an event to hand out pamphlets as communities brace for a reported wave of Ice raids.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Immigration rights activists talk in Miami, during an event to hand out pamphlets as communities brace for a reported wave of Ice raids.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Bello/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Democratic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayorOfLA/status/1150138702233911296\">leaders</a>, <a href=\"https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/video/4123111-maywood-church-offers-sanctuary-to-immigrants-targeted-by-ice-raids/\">churches</a>, <a href=\"https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/press-room/uc-statement-immigration-raids-immigration-and-customs-enforcement\">universities</a> and others vowed not to help Ice.

      "bodyText": "Immigration raids were expected in major US cities on Sunday, a prospect that sparked anger, fear, protests and attempts to protect those in peril. On Saturday night, New York mayor Bill de Blasio said in a tweet that Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or Ice, had mounted raids but had not succeeded in rounding up anyone in Harlem or Sunset Park in Brooklyn. Like many other mayors the Democrat, who is running for the presidential nomination, has said his city will not cooperate with Ice. On Sunday evidence of raids was scarce and Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, would not confirm to CNN\u2019s State of the Union whether the raids had begun. Capturing dangerous criminals \u201cremains the priority for Ice\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cIce is protecting Americans [by] removing these criminals. Coming across the border illegally is a crime. [But] when we talk about prioritization for removal, we\u2019re not prioritizing that.\u201d Cuccinelli was asked what he would say to people like De Blasio who maintain that the raids are a political stunt. \u201cIt is about keeping the community safer,\u201d he said. \u201cJust the expectations impose such a deterrent effect. What we call the \u2018Trump Effect.\u2019\u201d The raids were expected to target roughly 2,000 migrants in the US illegally but the prospect rippled terror through whole communities. Cuccinelli would not guarantee no parents would be separated from children. In Atlanta on Sunday, advocacy groups and legal observers kept an eye on the streets. One lawyer told the Guardian Ice agents were in Clayton county, just south of the city, at 5am. Members of the Georgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights met at its offices north of Atlanta, near the city\u2019s migrant corridor, hoping to stream operations on social media. Mario Guevara, a reporter for Mundo Hispanico with more than 300,000 followers on Facebook, was out early. He found only one undocumented woman, selling tamales. In her few months in Atlanta she had never seen Ice agents. She intended to work as usual, regardless of \u201crumors\u201d of a raid. A legal observer with Project South told the Guardian: \u201cNo news is good news.\u201d According to legal and law enforcement sources, raids in Atlanta were likely to be spread through the week. One immigration attorney, Pamela Peynado Stewart, said one contact had been made on Friday. \u201cWe recently learned that four Ice officers knocked at a single mother\u2019s home on Friday at 8am for the sole purpose of arresting the mother and her two young children,\u201d she said. \u201cShe had no crimes but did have an order of deportation in absentia from a few years back. \u201cThe family states that the Ice officers left the home without making a single arrest and simply asked the mother to follow some instructions and appear at a supervision, which she fully intends on doing.\u201d In San Diego, Ice arrested 27 people in an \u201cenforcement surge\u201d over the last week, spokeswoman Lauren Mack told the Guardian. Twenty arrests were targeted and seven were considered \u201ccollateral\u201d, meaning they may not be subject to deportation. The arrests, Mack said, were not part of the raids Trump has promoted. Ice said 85% of those arrested had convictions or charges on their record, thereby suggesting it was detaining people with no criminal history. Such \u201ccollateral\u201d arrests added a new level of fear, said Sandra Cordero, director of Families Belong Together, based in Los Angeles: \u201cIt\u2019s really really dangerous, because it just terrifies an entire community and allies and folks who have not been targeted before. It\u2019s going to bring a lot of havoc to folks who happen to be in a location.\u201d Cordero said she had not heard reports of raids in LA but said communities were on high alert: \u201cPeople are doing what they can to protect themselves.\u201d In northern California, activists said there had not been any raids in the Bay Area. But fear had spread elsewhere. Ambar Tovar, United Farm Workers\u2019 directing attorney, said people were staying off the streets in the Central Valley, a region not on the rumored list of targets. \u201cThe Trump administration is trying to instil fear and even if nothing happens he\u2019s accomplishing that,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are not willing to come out.\u201d Democratic leaders, churches, universities and others vowed not to help Ice. Across the country, undocumented migrants described plans to buy groceries, in anticipation of locking themselves indoors. Businesses which rely on migrant labor reported employees staying home. \u201cThis administration\u2019s deliberate terrorizing of immigrant families and communities grows worse every day,\u201d Mary Bauer, deputy legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Immigrant Justice Project, told the Guardian. \u201cThe continued mistreatment of children held in detention facilities, the attacks on our asylum system, and the assaults on immigrant communities through threatened raids show that this administration\u2019s priority is terrorizing communities and not solving our nation\u2019s immigration problems.\u201d The planned actions come on the heels of congressional testimony about \u201chorrifying\u201d conditions inside detention facilities at the southern border. On Friday, reporters with vice-president Mike Pence visited a station in McAllen, Texas, and described men held in cages in \u201csweltering\u201d heat where the \u201cstench was horrendous\u201d. Officials have floated the idea of using hotels to hold those seized, prompting one chain, Marriott, to say it would not allow its buildings to be used. Ice responded that it would be forced to separate families if it lacked capacity. Trump first said his administration would conduct nationwide raids in June, only to postpone them. Opponents have had time to organize. Lights for Liberty vigils were attended by the American Teachers Federation and sponsored by the Women\u2019s March. Bridgette Gomez, director of strategic partnerships at Planned Parenthood, the largest network of not-for-profit reproductive health clinics in the US, said: \u201cThese raids are a cruel, racist and dangerous extension of the Trump-Pence administration\u2019s already horrifying policies.\u201d",

Almost simultaneously the cricket came to an even more dramatic conclusion, as the two sides finished level after 50 overs thanks to a freakish boundary in England\u2019s final over, and level again in the super over, giving the home side victory on the basis of having hit more boundaries over the course of the game. The \u201cdizzying, sickening, drama of those final minutes\u201d made it perhaps the greatest game of one-day cricket ever played, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/lords-perfect-venue-greatest-one-day-game-ever-played\">writes Andy Bull</a>.</p> <p><strong>Consecutive interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus have left Australia little \u201cwriggle room\u201d to revive the economy in the event of a further downturn</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/15/economy-has-heaps-of-stimulus-but-rba-may-have-fired-too-many-bullets-warns-deloitte\">Deloitte Access Economics has warned</a>.

Pressley is African American, Tlaib was born to Palestinian immigrants and Ocasio-Cortez comes from a New York-Puerto Rican family. Tlaib responded by saying Trump \u201cneeds to be impeached\u201d. Ocasio-Cortez said: \u201cThe country I \u2018come from\u2019, and the country we all swear to, is the United States.\u201d Epic drama lit up two historic London sporting venues overnight, as Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the first fifth-set tiebreak to settle a Wimbledon singles title, and England won a nerve-shredding cricket World Cup final at Lord\u2019s against New Zealand. Djokovic won 7-6, 1-6, 7-6, 4-6, 13-12 \u2013 the longest Wimbledon singles final \u2013 after Federer failed to convert two championship points in the fifth set. Almost simultaneously the cricket came to an even more dramatic conclusion, as the two sides finished level after 50 overs thanks to a freakish boundary in England\u2019s final over, and level again in the super over, giving the home side victory on the basis of having hit more boundaries over the course of the game. The \u201cdizzying, sickening, drama of those final minutes\u201d made it perhaps the greatest game of one-day cricket ever played, writes Andy Bull. Consecutive interest rate cuts and fiscal stimulus have left Australia little \u201cwriggle room\u201d to revive the economy in the event of a further downturn, Deloitte Access Economics has warned. In its latest business outlook report, Deloitte says there is \u201cheaps of stimulus\u201d in the economy, including \u201creduced policy uncertainty\u201d after the election, $158bn of personal income tax cuts, reduced bank funding costs, a lower Australian dollar and less stringent lending standards for home loans. \u201cCurrent conditions are better than many people think,\u201d it says. \u201cAnd, in turn, that raises an important question \u2013 have policymakers fired off too many bullets now, leaving them short of ammo in the event of a more substantial slowdown?\u201d World A journalist who Boris Johnson secretly discussed helping a friend to have beaten up has demanded an apology from the UK Conservative leadership candidate as he stands on the brink of Downing Street. Violent clashes erupted late on Sunday between Hong Kong police and protesters at the end of a peaceful demonstration against the controversial extradition bill. South Africa\u2019s former president Jacob Zuma will make an unprecedented appearance before a judicial inquiry for a five-day grilling this week over corruption allegations relating to his years in power. Burkina Faso, one of Africa\u2019s bastions of press freedom, is attempting to enact harsh legislation that threatens journalists reporting on an unfolding security crisis, human rights organisations and press freedom advocates have warned. Melting permafrost has sparked warnings from activists and officials in northern Russia of a \u201cgold rush\u201d for mammoth ivory, as prospectors dig up tusks and other woolly mammoth remains that can net a small fortune on the Chinese market. Opinion and analysis \u201cHe was the paramount of exaggeration and distortion and lies. He was a clown \u2013 a successful clown.\u201d So says the former EU official Willy H\u00e9lin, who became the butt of a classic Boris Johnson dispatch from Brussels when the Tory leadership aspirant was a correspondent for the Daily Telegraph in the 1990s. In the intervening years, Johnson\u2019s persona has elevated him to the highest stage. But according to those who knew him and worked with him in Brussels, the origins of his performance in those years were a crucial part of his political DNA. His five-year stint in the city as a reporter, they say, shaped his politics and influenced the wider British Eurosceptic movement. Temporary skilled migration has not undercut job opportunities or conditions for Australian workers but the \u201crevolving door\u201d political response to foreign workers has frustrated businesses, an industry report has found. The report from the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia said skilled migrants, particularly those on temporary skilled working visas, have been an \u201coverwhelming net positive\u201d for the economy. But despite economic evidence suggesting migration is a positive, \u201cgovernments have responded to community concern with a seeming revolving door of reviews, reports and frequent policy changes to Australia\u2019s temporary skilled migration program\u201d. Sport As if there wasn\u2019t enough drama in British sport on Sunday, Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix for a record sixth time at Silverstone, with his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas second. Behind them the battle between Red Bull and Ferrari threw up an epic scrap, one that has surely ended even the faintest title hopes of Sebastian Vettel. What can the AFL do with the hapless Gold Coast Suns, whose performance at Metricon Stadium on Saturday was so bad it drew laughs from the opposing Adelaide coaches\u2019 box? The region where Australian sport goes to die will now almost surely secure another wooden spoon, writes Craig Little. Thinking time: Gaye Su Akyol, Turkey\u2019s psychpop powerhouse \u201cThis is the hub of pop culture in Istanbul,\u201d says Gaye Su Akyol, as the singing sensation \u2013 who gets called \u201cthe most courageous artist in Turkey\u201d and has been questioned by the police about her lyrics \u2013 takes Robin Denselow on a tour of Istanbul to explain how political turmoil feeds her work. \u201cThis is where I was raised and where I live. This where my friends and memories are. And when politics made things difficult for musicians, this is where they ran to.\u201d Turkey\u2019s most intriguing psych-folk-rock singer and songwriter is providing a musical history lesson as she shows me around her neighbourhood, Kadik\u00f6y, an area of narrow streets, coffee shops, bars and clubs on the Asian side of Istanbul. President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan wanted the area transformed, and for a mosque to be built in Gezi Park \u2013 a space, Akyol says, \u201cwhere people could come together\u201d. In 2013, those plans led to demonstrations, in which she took part, and to a violent police response that led to injuries and deaths. This summer the mood in Istanbul has changed. We pass an old election poster for Ekrem \u0130mamo\u011flu, the new mayor, from the opposition party CHP, who in June won a rerun of the previously annulled election, this time with a massively increased majority. It was a major blow for Erdo\u011fan. \u201cPeople went crazy,\u201d says Akyol. \u201cThis is very big. This is the start of things. Erdo\u011fan said that if you lose Istanbul, you lose Turkey.\u201d Media roundup The Australian starts the week with demands from five Australian business groups to the industry minister, Karen Andrews, for urgent reform to the building industry. The ABC reveals that an internal briefing note from the Australian defence force last year warned of an influx of climate refugees to Australia and notes the ADF does not have an overarching strategy to address the risks. The Age reports that the \u201cviability of the Christian Brothers is in doubt\u201d after the order has had to pay out $213m in sexual abuse compensation. Coming up The inquest into overdose deaths of six young people at music festivals in NSW continues in Sydney. The annual Helpmann awards for the Australian theatre and live entertainment industry are presented in Melbourne.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s all from me. Algeria had a flood of first-half chances, but achieved little in the second period until Riyad Mahrez stepped up for that late, late free kick. It was enough. Bye! What cool from Mahrez. What guts, what technique. He had a quiet game, but somehow he\u2019s always there in the key moments. Nigeria handled him very well, but he still comes out of the game with a goal and an assist. So Algeria will play Senegal in Friday\u2019s final! They have probably been the two best sides across the tournament, and one of them will win it. 90+6 mins: It\u2019s all over! The referee gets everyone lined up for a centre-kick, but the moment it\u2019s taken he blows for full time! 90+5 mins: That was Akpeyi\u2019s side of the goal, unprotected by the wall. It had to be a hard and precise shot if it was to go in, and that\u2019s what it was! 90+5 mins: Mahrez curls a cracker into the far corner! 90+4 mins: Now Algeria have a free kick, 20 yards from goal and central. It\u2019s a fabulous shooting chance. If this goes in, it\u2019s over. 90+3 mins: Mahrez runs into the area, but he perhaps takes one touch too many and loses the ball before he can take his shot! 90+2 mins: Algeria hit the bar! Bennacer blasts in a shot from 20 yards that thumps into the meat of the bar with Akpeyi beaten! 90+1 mins: There will be four minutes of stoppage time. 90 mins: Chance for Algeria! Feghouli collects the ball on the edge of the area and turns. His marker moves away from him to cover a possible pass to Mahrez, so Feghouli decides to have a shot. It isn\u2019t a good one. 89 mins: Awaziem has been booked for something or other. It wasn\u2019t shown on TV. He would now miss the final. 88 mins: Musa plays the ball to Henry, just inside the area, but he takes a low-percentage shot that wasn\u2019t going in, and certainly wasn\u2019t once it clipped a defender\u2019s calf. The referee didn\u2019t see that either. Goal kick. 86 mins: Belaili run down the left, lifts the ball over Awaziem, and is taken out by the defender, who I thought made a deliberate movement as he slid under the ball to make sure he caught his opponent\u2019s leg. The referee sadly doesn\u2019t have slow-motion eyes, and gives a goal kick. 84 mins: There have been two free kicks in the last couple of minutes. Mahrez for Algeria and Etebo for Nigeria both overhit them, one into touch and one to the keeper. There\u2019s very little precision about anything anyone\u2019s doing. 80 mins: It\u2019s been a poor second half, in which next to nothing has been created from open play. Iwobi has a shot from 23 yards or so, which is on target but easily stopped. 78 mins: A first substitution, and it sees Henry replace Chukwueze for Nigeria. 76 mins: So nearly 200 minutes of semi-finals have been played, and we\u2019ve had two own goals and a penalty. Will this one follow the first into extra time? 72 mins: Such a long delay, and it ends with Ighalo sending the goalkeeper the wrong way before sidefooting a splendid spot-kick into the corner of the net! 72 mins: Odion Ighalo will take it. He places the ball on the spot \u2026 71 mins: The referee does give the penalty! And he books Mandi to boot! 70 mins: Finally, the referee goes to have a look himself. I think he\u2019ll point to the spot here. 69 mins: Mandi is the defender in question. The game has been held up while the VAR had a good look at all available replays. It\u2019s all taking way too long, though. 69 mins: That looked awfully handbally to me. The defender\u2019s arm was not far from his body, but the ball took a long time getting there. 68 mins: Nigeria appeal for handball as Etebo\u2019s shot is blocked inside the area, but nothing is given (yet). Feghouli is then booked for a foul on Etebo. 66 mins: Nigeria are straining to find a way back into this game, but Algeria have contained them well. Still, while the margin is so slender they remain just one brilliant moment from parity. 63 mins: Algeria win a free-kick on the left. It\u2019s headed to the edge of the area and eventually falls to Feghouli, whose volley flies well wide. 59 mins: Iwobi holds off Mahrez before squirting a shot wide from 25 yards. 57 mins: Guedioura is rolling around in apparent agony, after Musa \u2013 entirely innocently \u2013 trod on his foot. 55 mins: A nice combination from Nigeria ends when Musa doesn\u2019t quite control, and the ball is aimlessly but emphatically booted clear. 55 mins: This is fun, a game being played at a really high tempo. Quite a lot of errors, but plenty of quality as well. But can anyone score a goal in the right net in these semi-finals. 52 mins: A first booking, and the yellow card is shown to Bounedjah for desperately hacking down Iwobi from behind as the Nigeria forward bursts through Algeria\u2019s half on the counter. 50 mins: A lovely ball into the area looks for a moment destined for Bounedjah, but Troost-Ekong gets in the way. 47 mins: Bennacer is ordered off the field, apparently because the referee is not happy with the midfielder\u2019s socks. 46 mins: Peeeeeeep! Nigeria start half No2! The players are on their way back out. Can Algeria hang on to this? Yes, yes we are satisfied with such passion! Entertain yourself through half-time with a report on the other semi-final: 45+2 mins: Algeria deservedly lead at the break. They should have had more \u2013 Bounedjah should have had a brace, for a start \u2013 but though Riyad Mahrez has been very quiet, the only time he\u2019s got into Nigeria\u2019s area it led to a goal. I\u2019ll be back in a few minutes. 45+1 mins: Into stoppage time, of which there\u2019ll be about a minute. 43 mins: Not just a stroke of luck but an entire bucket of luck-strokes for Algeria, but the scoreline still doesn\u2019t reflect their dominance of this game, at least in terms of chance creation. They should probably be three up, but in the end they needed their opponents to score for them. 40 mins: Another chance for Algeria. A lovely pass to Mahrez on the right, with three players to his left. He ghosts past Collins and crosses; the ball flicks off Collins, hits Troost-Ekong on the stomach and flies into the net! 39 mins: Ighalo shoots just wide! Iwobi passes to him on the edge of the area. His first touch is good, and he can\u2019t see the team-mate running into space to his left, so he shoots low but just beyond the far post! 36 mins: Nearly an own goal now! Again the ball is lifted through towards Bounedjah; Collins flings out a foot and sends the ball floating over his goalkeeper, and just over the bar! Then the corner picks out Feghouli beyond the far post, and he attempts a ludicrously tough scissor-kick, which sends the ball in entirely the wrong direction. Just head it in lad! 33 mins: Now a penalty shout for Algeria. Bounedjah and Troost-Ekong run along the left-hand edge of the box, shoulder to shoulder. There\u2019s certainly contact, but they\u2019re both leaning in and a penalty would have been absurdly harsh. So just as well it wasn\u2019t given. 31 mins: Nigeria have a free-kick just outside the penalty area, on the right-hand corner. Someone in the crowd is shining a green laser-pointy-thing in Chukwueze\u2019s face as he prepares to take it. Eventually he curls in a left-foot shot that M\u2019bolhi saves easily enough. 29 mins: Algeria miss another glorious chance! They play another early pass over the defence. Omeruo totally fluffs his attempt to defend it and Bounnedjah runs onto it and into the area, with only the goalkeeper to beat, and \u2026 he hits a desperately weak shot straight into Akpeyi. 26 mins: Zeffane runs down the right, gets near the byline and then shanks his cross straight into touch. 23 mins: Both teams are going a bit long and a bit early at present, high-risk passes which aren\u2019t really paying off. 19 mins: The ball is played over the top for Belaili, but Awaziem blocks his path. That looked a bit like deliberate obstruction, but nothing\u2019s given. 18 mins: Now a chance for Nigeria! Chukwueze crosses from deep on the right, and Awaziem at the far post heads high! This is all very promising. 16 mins: Another miss from Algeria! Bennacer plays a beautiful ball into the penalty area from a free-kick on the left, and Bensebaini rises unmarked just beyond the penalty spot but heads over the bar! 13 mins: Ighalo buys another free-kick, this time making the most of a little contact from Benlamri, who was behind him. Nothing comes of it. 11 mins: Algeria continue to push. Bennacer\u2019s shot hits a defender at the end of a long period in which they moved the ball around the periphery of Nigeria\u2019s penalty area without ever quite creating the killer chance. 7 mins: What a chance for Algeria! It\u2019s a cross from the left from Belaili. Akpeyi dives forwards to grab the ball but fluffs it, and it bounces up and into Bounedjah\u2019s hip, level with the far post and with the goal completely unguardarded. It deflects the wrong side of the stick! 7 mins: Another attempt to release Musa down Nigeria\u2019s left flank, but this time the pass is overhit and runs away for a goal kick. 5 mins: Musa is released down the left, but is tackled as he attempts to jink infield. 3 mins: Neither side has done anything that could reasonably be called an attack so far. A bit of gentle sparring to start things off. 1 min: After 20 seconds Guedioura runs into Ighalo, and gets a talking-to from the referee. In fact there wasn\u2019t much contact, and Ighalo made the very most of it. 1 min: Peeeeeeeeep! Algeria get the game started. Anthems sung, the game will be under way in a few moments. Algeria and Nigeria have only played each other eight times, surprisingly. They\u2019ve won three apiece and drawn twice. The winners will play Senegal, back in this stadium on Friday. Senegal beat Tunisia after extra time across town a little earlier. The players are on their way out of the long, red-carpeted tunnel. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how the players cope with the disruption of being glued to the Cricket World Cup final for the last few hours. Riyad Mahrez is practising those far-post curlers: This is the cleanest dressing room I\u2019ve ever seen: The teams have been announced, and here they are: Algeria: M\u2019Bolhi; Zeffane, Mandi, Benlamri, Bensebaini; Feghouli, Gu\u00e9dioura, Bennacer; Mahrez, Bounedjah, Belaili. Nigeria: Akpeyi; Awaziem, Troost Ekong, Omeruo, Collins; Ndidi, Etebo; Chukwueze, Iwobi, Musa; Ighalo. Nigeria have made their way to the semi-finals without beating any team at this tournament by more than a single goal, and despite losing 2-0 to Madagascar in their final group game. Algeria have been more fluent, though they needed penalties to squeeze past Ivory Coast in the quarter-finals. \u201cWe have a team of warriors and we must seize our chance to win this tournament,\u201d roars Riyad Mahrez, and the bookmakers at least are backing them to reach the final. How things change. The teams last met in qualifying for the 2018 World Cup, when Algeria came last in Group B while Nigeria won it at a canter. \u201cThey were fragile at the time,\u201d says the Nigeria coach, Gernot Rohr. \u201cWe beat them 3-1 and there were lots of individual mistakes, they made it easy for us. In the return match [drawn 1-1] they were also fragile. Now they are solid, they have a good balance between attack and defence, they are still very physical and they have progressed a lot.

Not enough to lift them out of the category of hate-group. Not enough to stop you wanting to weep at the contortions of logic and perversions of thought that can be followed in the name of God.

Surviving America\u2019s Most Hated Family (BBC Two) was his exploration of whether things have changed since founder Fred Phelps (known as Gramps to the rest of the church, largely made up of those with his own fervid blood running through their veins) died five years ago. The short answer is \u2013 no, not enough to make a meaningful difference. Not enough to lift them out of the category of hate-group. Not enough to stop you wanting to weep at the contortions of logic and perversions of thought that can be followed in the name of God.

      "body": "<p>'Here\u2019s to the new century,\u201d says Sam Carne, raising a glass during dinner at Trenwith. \u201cWhat do it hold for us?\u201d And here\u2019s to the new series of Poldark and what it holds for us, it seems, is more of the same. So here\u2019s Ross Poldark looking pensive and tousled; here\u2019s George Warleggan being vile (\u201cWhy should we pay more for labour when we can get it for less?\u201d). Here are the sweeping shots of Cornwall, and some peasants about to start rioting. Poldark is about to take on \u2013 again \u2013 a lost cause that will pit him against the establishment, but which he will predictably win. And there cannot be a single Poldark fan who didn\u2019t smile when panto servant Prudie uttered her catchphrase \u201c\u2019T\u2019int fair, \u2018t\u2019int right!\u201d. We\u2019d waited all episode for it, and she delivered right at the end. None of this is a bad thing. There\u2019s something deeply comforting about it all \u2013 it\u2019s as cosy and familiar as a candlelit supper at the Nampara kitchen table.</p> \n<p>This is the fifth and final series of Poldark, or so they say. There are more Winston Graham novels, set later, so the makers haven\u2019t ruled out a return, but this could be in years to come. Instead, writer Debbie Horsfield has departed from the books, and there\u2019s a lot to tie up. Will Valentine ever find out about his true father? Will a Poldark mine ever turn a profit? Will Morwenna ever recover from her torturous first marriage?</p> \n<p>But this is Poldark, so there\u2019s still time to cram in a few outlandish new plots. In what may come to be seen as actor Aidan Turner\u2019s audition tape for James Bond, Poldark is being recruited. \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s government,\u201d says a shadowy figure, Wickham, in a box at the theatre after Poldark foils an assassination attempt on the king, \u201ccan always find a covert role for a person of your talents.\u201d</p> \n<p>But we\u2019re jumping ahead too quickly \u2013 a familiar feeling for Poldark fans. The episode opened in flashback to Virginia in 1781, with our captain lying, bloody-faced, amid slain British soldiers. So that\u2019s how he got the scar on his cheek. And that\u2019s how he meets Dwight Enys, the decent but drippy army surgeon who becomes his best friend. Their commanding officer is Ned Despard (a real historical figure; so is Wickham).</p> \n<p>At home in Cornwall \u2013 it\u2019s now 1800 \u2013 Despard\u2019s wife Catherine arrives on the early coach from London with a letter from her husband, begging Poldark to help get him out of jail, where he has been imprisoned without trial. \u201cHe said I should warn you, if you take on his case, it may be the rashest thing you ever do.\u201d She knows how to play him.</p> \n<p>There is a conspiracy against her husband, involving new villain Ralph Hanson, a colonialist mahogany trader who wears the kind of black leather gloves that make even the kindest person look like a murderer. He is furious that Despard, the governor of Honduras, was giving land to formerly enslaved people, and tries to ingratiate himself with the soon-to-be-knighted George Warleggan. But all is not well with George \u2013 after the death, last series, of his wife Elizabeth, he sees and hears her everywhere.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom

As well as Kitty, there is new peasant agitator Tess Tregidden, and Hanson\u2019s rebel daughter Cecily. And of course the enduringly no-nonsense Demelza who, in this episode, saves her family from their burning cottage after someone firebombs it. The story gallops along like Seamus the horse on a Cornish clifftop. It\u2019s all faintly ridiculous, but I couldn\u2019t imagine it any other way.</p>",

Poldark is about to take on \u2013 again \u2013 a lost cause that will pit him against the establishment, but which he will predictably win. And there cannot be a single Poldark fan who didn\u2019t smile when panto servant Prudie uttered her catchphrase \u201c\u2019T\u2019int fair, \u2018t\u2019int right!\u201d. We\u2019d waited all episode for it, and she delivered right at the end. None of this is a bad thing. There\u2019s something deeply comforting about it all \u2013 it\u2019s as cosy and familiar as a candlelit supper at the Nampara kitchen table. This is the fifth and final series of Poldark, or so they say. There are more Winston Graham novels, set later, so the makers haven\u2019t ruled out a return, but this could be in years to come. Instead, writer Debbie Horsfield has departed from the books, and there\u2019s a lot to tie up. Will Valentine ever find out about his true father? Will a Poldark mine ever turn a profit? Will Morwenna ever recover from her torturous first marriage? But this is Poldark, so there\u2019s still time to cram in a few outlandish new plots. In what may come to be seen as actor Aidan Turner\u2019s audition tape for James Bond, Poldark is being recruited. \u201cHis Majesty\u2019s government,\u201d says a shadowy figure, Wickham, in a box at the theatre after Poldark foils an assassination attempt on the king, \u201ccan always find a covert role for a person of your talents.\u201d But we\u2019re jumping ahead too quickly \u2013 a familiar feeling for Poldark fans. The episode opened in flashback to Virginia in 1781, with our captain lying, bloody-faced, amid slain British soldiers. So that\u2019s how he got the scar on his cheek. And that\u2019s how he meets Dwight Enys, the decent but drippy army surgeon who becomes his best friend. Their commanding officer is Ned Despard (a real historical figure; so is Wickham). At home in Cornwall \u2013 it\u2019s now 1800 \u2013 Despard\u2019s wife Catherine arrives on the early coach from London with a letter from her husband, begging Poldark to help get him out of jail, where he has been imprisoned without trial. \u201cHe said I should warn you, if you take on his case, it may be the rashest thing you ever do.\u201d She knows how to play him. There is a conspiracy against her husband, involving new villain Ralph Hanson, a colonialist mahogany trader who wears the kind of black leather gloves that make even the kindest person look like a murderer. He is furious that Despard, the governor of Honduras, was giving land to formerly enslaved people, and tries to ingratiate himself with the soon-to-be-knighted George Warleggan. But all is not well with George \u2013 after the death, last series, of his wife Elizabeth, he sees and hears her everywhere. Catherine, or Kitty, is a great addition \u2013 a former slave who also really existed \u2013 played with elegant defiance by Kerri McLean. \u201cShe is a remarkable woman,\u201d says Despard to Poldark, who visits him in prison. I\u2019m hoping for great things. \u201cAsk yourself, what is it that corrupts the milk of human kindness, turns the just and tender-hearted into vile rapacious brutes?\u201d she says to the rapt crowd at an abolitionist meeting. \u201cIt is the single-minded pursuit of profit. How long can this continue?\u201d Try 200 years later, Kitty. With the demise of Elizabeth, a woman constrained by her time though not that interested in challenging it, it feels as if this series might focus more on the proto-feminist women still standing. As well as Kitty, there is new peasant agitator Tess Tregidden, and Hanson\u2019s rebel daughter Cecily. And of course the enduringly no-nonsense Demelza who, in this episode, saves her family from their burning cottage after someone firebombs it. The story gallops along like Seamus the horse on a Cornish clifftop. It\u2019s all faintly ridiculous, but I couldn\u2019t imagine it any other way.",

      "bodyText": "Novak Djokovic called his Wimbledon final victory over Roger Federer \u201cthe most mentally demanding match of his career\u201d after finding a way to overcome his opponent and a Centre Court crowd that was overwhelmingly against him. The Serb came through 7-6 (5), 1-6, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 13-12 (3) after four hours and 57 minutes of play, having had to survive two championship points in the fifth set, but insisted he had never lost his self-belief. \u201cI had the most physically demanding match against Rafael Nadal in the finals of Australia that went almost six hours,\u201d he said. \u201cBut mentally this was different level, because of everything. I was one shot away from losing the match, as well. This match had everything. It could have gone easily his way. He was serving extremely well, I thought, the entire match. I had a lot of difficulties to read his serve. \u201cI thought most of the match I was on the back foot,\u201d he added. \u201cI was defending and he was dictating the play. I just tried to fight and find a way when it mattered the most, which is what happened. \u201cI just tried to never lose self-belief, to stay calm, and to just focus on trying to get the ball back, return, which wasn\u2019t serving me very well. And in the most important moments, in all three tie-breaks, I found my best game.\u201d Meanwhile Federer tried to put a brave face on his defeat, which hurt all the more given that he missed two match points when serving and 8-7 up in the final set. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I feel right now, he said. \u201cI just feel like it\u2019s such an incredible opportunity missed, I can\u2019t believe it. But you take it on your chin, you move on. You try to forget, try to take the good things out of this match. Federer was also asked about how this match compared to 2008 when he lost another five-set classic against Rafael Nadal. \u201cEpic ending, so close, so many moments so sure there\u2019s similarities, he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m the loser both times, so that\u2019s the only similarity I see. \u201cMaybe like after 2008 I will look back at it and think: \u2018Well, it\u2019s not that bad after all.\u2019 For now it hurts, and it should, like every loss does here at Wimbledon. \u201cBut I\u2019m very strong at being able to move on because I don\u2019t want to be depressed about actually an amazing tennis match.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Japan has the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe firmly on his agenda, after an exploratory trip here resulted in victory in the Grand Prix de Paris. Seizing such an important French prize on Bastille Day should arguably have made him terribly unpopular but this good-looking colt only added to his fan club with this, his first Group One success, but surely not his last. Aidan O\u2019Brien, the winning trainer, neatly sidestepped the question when asked if this performance amounted to proof that Japan is the best of his generation. But the betting market is prepared to consider it, as he was widely cut to 9-1 for the Arc, having been 16-1 on Sunday morning. Japan\u2019s progress in the last two months since he was fourth in the Dante, is the more impressive because of the setback he suffered in the spring. \u201cHe had a slight little thing,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe had a temperature very early and we had to ease off him for three weeks. That delayed us. We thought he wasn\u2019t going to make a run before the Derby but he ran in the Dante and he was really babyish at the time. We haven\u2019t forced him to do it.\u201d There will still be doubters, who can point to the fact that the runner-up here, Slalom, blew the start and was beaten only half a length in the end. O\u2019Brien feels, however, that his horse could have done much more if seriously pressed. \u201cWe were very happy with him,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cHe\u2019s a horse that always, when he got to the front, he didn\u2019t do much. He never wins very far. He probably won further than usual in Ascot because they went very fast and the field came back to him. \u201cThe lads [Coolmore, owners of Japan] will decide what they want to do but we were thinking we would give him a little break. Through the whole year, we\u2019ve been rushing him. We rushed him to the Dante, then the Derby, then he came to Ascot. So, a little break and then either the Irish Champion or the Prix Niel here.

If it had to be anyone to stand at the top of his mark, watched by millions but all alone in the moment, holding New Zealand\u2019s World Cup fate in the literal palm of his hand, it would always be Trent Boult. One of the best two bowlers his country has produced, one of the best two players in his side his whole career. Left arm, slight of build, deliverer of the perfect shape. The in-swing, the disguised bouncer, the slower ball, the unhittable full length.</p> \n<p>So he bowls. Curving in-swing, the yorker. Like a star tenor, perfect pitch. Ben Stokes, not out on 83 and swinging for the hills, hits the last ball of the match. Dug out for a single, like so many Boult deliveries before it. A run out coming back for the second. A tie. Then under the new rules, Boult has to come back and do it all again.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/14/england-new-zealand-cricket-world-cup-final-match-report-super-over\">England win Cricket World Cup after super-over drama against New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>New Zealand are the most condescended-to team in world cricket. Through the tournament previews we heard the phrase \u201cdark horse\u201d so often that you might wonder whether the upcoming event was a cricket World Cup or a midnight race meeting. There is a constant and recurring amnesia about the fact that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/mar/29/australia-new-zealand-world-cup-final\" title=\"\">New Zealand stormed to the previous final in 2015</a>, or made the semi-finals in almost every iteration before that.</p> \n<p>Bangladesh and Afghanistan still get the condescension of praise for being competitive, but they are recent enough in their development to partially warrant it. New Zealand teams have been good for decades. Then there is the persistent \u201cnicest guys in cricket\u201d narrative, which is partly based in admiration but would not lead the line so much if people held their ability in higher regard.</p> \n<p>On Sunday, that team made England \u2013 the team and the nation of supporters \u2013 sweat on a cool and breezy afternoon. They jiggled every knee, jangled every nerve, reanimated every dormant anxiety. They killed Lord\u2019s softly, rocked it gently, battling their way to a mid-range score, squeezing the air out of the chase, then once Stokes and Jos Buttler looked to have taken the game away, came back with fierce bowling and fearless fielding to force a tie.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f5fde6b6-0d76-4b5c-8587-5fe91da1e4af\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3PbULIbF-es?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>A tie in a World Cup final. As if that wasn\u2019t absurd enough, the tournament now uses the Twenty20 invention of the super over as a decider. Any previous year the teams would have shared the trophy, and after the quality of the match on Sunday no one could have argued with the fairness of that. But the rules have changed, probably with no one imagining they might actually be used. And so the super over went down to its very last ball as well. And was tied again.</p> \n<p>After New Zealand\u2019s seamers smashed up Sri Lanka in their first match of the tournament, they never dominated. They battled past modest sides thanks to a couple of Kane Williamson specials with the bat, but were beaten badly by Pakistan, Australia and England in the group stage.</p> \n<p>Come the semi-finals, though, New Zealand were able to play at their level. On slower pitches they batted first to build half-decent scores, then bowled and fielded like demons. First to knock off India, then nearly England.</p> \n<p>Never have the margins been finer in a race to the finish. With nine deliveries to go, Boult catching Stokes before stepping on the boundary to concede six. With three balls to go, Martin Guptill nearly running out Stokes, only for the ball to deflect off the diving batsman for four.</p> \n<p>This was England\u2019s day. And a super over could not have been designed better to suit their big-hitting style. Stokes, still warm. Buttler, the perfect machine for this. Boult had done it once but couldn\u2019t again. But then Jimmy Neesham, one of those useful all-rounders, smashed England\u2019s Jofra Archer in reply.</p> \n<p>If it had to be anyone with New Zealand\u2019s World Cup fate in his hands, you probably didn\u2019t want it to be Guptill. The opening batsman is one of the cleanest strikers in the world when on song, but lost his voice at this World Cup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For five balls it worked, as Guptill ran fiercely to get Neesham on strike. But in the grossly unfair situation of having one ball to face, Guptill couldn\u2019t find a gap.

      "bodyText": "Trent Boult. If it had to be anyone to stand at the top of his mark, watched by millions but all alone in the moment, holding New Zealand\u2019s World Cup fate in the literal palm of his hand, it would always be Trent Boult. One of the best two bowlers his country has produced, one of the best two players in his side his whole career. Left arm, slight of build, deliverer of the perfect shape. The in-swing, the disguised bouncer, the slower ball, the unhittable full length. So he bowls. Curving in-swing, the yorker. Like a star tenor, perfect pitch. Ben Stokes, not out on 83 and swinging for the hills, hits the last ball of the match. Dug out for a single, like so many Boult deliveries before it. A run out coming back for the second. A tie. Then under the new rules, Boult has to come back and do it all again. New Zealand are the most condescended-to team in world cricket. Through the tournament previews we heard the phrase \u201cdark horse\u201d so often that you might wonder whether the upcoming event was a cricket World Cup or a midnight race meeting. There is a constant and recurring amnesia about the fact that New Zealand stormed to the previous final in 2015, or made the semi-finals in almost every iteration before that. Bangladesh and Afghanistan still get the condescension of praise for being competitive, but they are recent enough in their development to partially warrant it. New Zealand teams have been good for decades. Then there is the persistent \u201cnicest guys in cricket\u201d narrative, which is partly based in admiration but would not lead the line so much if people held their ability in higher regard. On Sunday, that team made England \u2013 the team and the nation of supporters \u2013 sweat on a cool and breezy afternoon. They jiggled every knee, jangled every nerve, reanimated every dormant anxiety. They killed Lord\u2019s softly, rocked it gently, battling their way to a mid-range score, squeezing the air out of the chase, then once Stokes and Jos Buttler looked to have taken the game away, came back with fierce bowling and fearless fielding to force a tie. A tie in a World Cup final. As if that wasn\u2019t absurd enough, the tournament now uses the Twenty20 invention of the super over as a decider. Any previous year the teams would have shared the trophy, and after the quality of the match on Sunday no one could have argued with the fairness of that. But the rules have changed, probably with no one imagining they might actually be used. And so the super over went down to its very last ball as well. And was tied again. After New Zealand\u2019s seamers smashed up Sri Lanka in their first match of the tournament, they never dominated. They battled past modest sides thanks to a couple of Kane Williamson specials with the bat, but were beaten badly by Pakistan, Australia and England in the group stage. Come the semi-finals, though, New Zealand were able to play at their level. On slower pitches they batted first to build half-decent scores, then bowled and fielded like demons. First to knock off India, then nearly England. Never have the margins been finer in a race to the finish. With nine deliveries to go, Boult catching Stokes before stepping on the boundary to concede six. With three balls to go, Martin Guptill nearly running out Stokes, only for the ball to deflect off the diving batsman for four. This was England\u2019s day. And a super over could not have been designed better to suit their big-hitting style. Stokes, still warm. Buttler, the perfect machine for this. Boult had done it once but couldn\u2019t again. But then Jimmy Neesham, one of those useful all-rounders, smashed England\u2019s Jofra Archer in reply. If it had to be anyone with New Zealand\u2019s World Cup fate in his hands, you probably didn\u2019t want it to be Guptill. The opening batsman is one of the cleanest strikers in the world when on song, but lost his voice at this World Cup. For five balls it worked, as Guptill ran fiercely to get Neesham on strike. But in the grossly unfair situation of having one ball to face, Guptill couldn\u2019t find a gap. Another single, another despairing lunge, and a run out with New Zealand on the receiving end. These teams share a bond. It was after watching New Zealand\u2019s bravura 2015 World Cup that England vowed to discard their own hesitant way. It was a series against New Zealand in mid-2015 that saw that approach borne out on the field, with both teams flying to huge scores. Now this: a match that can knock off Australia and South Africa in 1999 as the most frenetic, transcendent, remarkable match in the history of the World Cup. It\u2019s a bond that two cricketing nations will share for ever. This was not New Zealand punching above their weight. This is their weight. They are the only side to go home without the trophy despite not losing a World Cup final. What they do have is a place, and this history. They should never be described as anyone\u2019s dark horse ever again.",

She said no team <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/28/cant-win-without-gays-usa-megan-rapinoe\">could win the event without gay players</a>, of which she is one. And she emerged as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/09/us-womens-soccer-team-equal-pay-us-soccer-world-cup\">a prominent voice for equal pay</a> after it was reported that the USA men\u2019s team earned significantly more than the women despite being significantly less successful.</p> <p>On Sunday that fight produced a significant result.

Do you believe that equal pay should be mandated? Do you believe that everyone should have healthcare? Do you believe that we should treat everyone with respect?

Well, yeah, that\u2019s true. Up to 44\u201d \u2013 Trump being the 45th president \u2013 \u201cI guess there was.\u201d She said: \u201cYou know what? I\u2019m going to fight for equal pay every day for myself, for my team, and for every single person out there, man, woman, immigrant, US citizen, person of color, whatever it may be. \u2018Equal pay,\u2019 as the great Serena Williams said, \u2018until I\u2019m in my grave.\u2019\u201d Rapino repeatedly made headlines on and off the field as the USA marched to the World Cup final, in which they beat the Netherlands 2-0. She said she would not go to the White House if the team were invited, prompting tweeted ire from Trump. She said no team could win the event without gay players, of which she is one. And she emerged as a prominent voice for equal pay after it was reported that the USA men\u2019s team earned significantly more than the women despite being significantly less successful. On Sunday that fight produced a significant result. Procter &amp; Gamble, a team sponsor, took out ads in the New York Times which said it was donating more than $500,000 to the women\u2019s national team players\u2019 association, $23,000 for each member of the 23-woman squad. The company also urged governing body US Soccer \u201cto be on the right side of history\u201d. In the aftermath of the World Cup one polling company suggested Rapinoe could beat Trump in a presidential election, the kind of coverage which prompted Sports Illustrated to write: \u201cThere are elements of a modern-day Muhammad Ali in Rapinoe\u2019s co-mingling of sports and social activism, to say nothing of her ability to turn the media\u2019s attention, even when negative in certain circles, to her advantage.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s very flattering,\u201d Rapinoe told NBC. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m Ali, but I\u2019m happy to be the biggest ally I can to Ali.\u201d This week, Rapinoe\u2019s remarks at a victory parade in New York City were a lightning rod for rightwing critics. She told NBC she was able to speak up in public because \u201cthe opportunity is in everyone\u2019s exhaustion of the fighting and the negative, and our team has managed to make people proud again, to capture people\u2019s interest, to make them want to do something. \u201cI think people are asking the question, \u2018How can we rally around this team?\u2019 \u2026 whether it\u2019s equal pay or racial equality or LGBTQ rights. I think we\u2019ve just managed to give people hope. And with that now we need to do the next step, which is to actually take the progress step.\u201d Asked what she would say to a notional soccer-loving Trump supporter who wanted her to visit the White House, Rapinoe said she would \u201ctry to share our message\u201d. \u201cDo you, you know, believe that all people are created equal? Do you believe that equal pay should be mandated? Do you believe that everyone should have healthcare? Do you believe that we should treat everyone with respect? I think those are the basics of what we\u2019re talking about. \u201cAnd I understand people feel upset or uncomfortable. There\u2019s, I think, some feelings of disrespect about the anthem protest or things that I\u2019ve said in the past, but ultimately I think I am here, open and honest. I\u2019ve admitted mistakes. I will continue to do that. \u201cI \u2026 want to have that conversation because I think Trump\u2019s message excludes people that look like me and that are me, of course, but it excludes a lot of people in his base as well. And I think that he\u2019s trying to divide so he can conquer, not unite so we can all conquer.\u201d Trump has seemed in two minds about whether the USA will be invited to the White House, as champion teams commonly are. Rapinoe said there were \u201clike, 50 policy issues that we can probably reverse and get going\u201d before the team would go. \u201cI mean,\u201d she said, \u201cit would take a tremendous amount I think. I understand that progress is sometimes slow and I\u2019ll never close any door all the way. But I think it would take more than Trump is willing to do.\u201d",

While many wondered why the World Cup Sunday, of all Sundays, had not been left free from county cricket, 500 or so doughty <strong>Lancashire</strong> supporters came through the turnstiles. Bafflement crossed the face of a spectator asked why he had not stayed at home to watch the World Cup final: \u201cWhy would we watch the television when you can watch Rob Jones bat?\u201d</p> <p>The aforementioned Jones made a very pretty 88, Glenn Maxwell, fresh from Australia\u2019s World Cup squad, 59, and the in-form Dane Vilas a century as Lancashire declared six short of 500 against a <strong>Sussex</strong> attack missing Chris Jordan (injured) and Ollie Robinson (with the Lions.) Sussex survived four overs before the close.</p> <p>Amar Virdi made a mockery of <strong>Nottinghamshire</strong>\u2019s decision to prepare a spinning pitch for their new import Ravi Ashwin at Trent Bridge. In his first Championship appearance of the season, having been given some \u201ctough love\u201d by <strong>Surrey</strong>, he took eight for 61 as Notts were dismissed for 116. Young Jamie Smith made 57 as Surrey built a lead of 308 despite the magic of Ashwin, who took four more wickets, giving him 10 in the match.</p> <p>At Chelmsford, <strong>Warwickshire</strong>\u2019s shorn batting stumbled to 161, with Peter Siddle taking five for 33.</p> <p>Darren Stevens again danced the dance of everlasting youth with his second five-fer in successive games, but only as <strong>Hampshire</strong> declared on 409 for nine. An unbeaten century from Joe Denly and 94 from Daniel Bell-Drummond took <strong>Kent</strong> past 300.</p> <p><strong>Somerset</strong> suffered one of their worst days in the Championship this season as <strong>Yorkshire</strong> continued to take advantage of a Gregory and Leach-less opposition, passing 500 with Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Harry Brook notching up their first Championship centuries of the season. Somerset had wobbled to 76 for four at the close.</p> <p>At the Riverside, <strong>Durham</strong> reached the heady heights of 212, from 47 for six, with fifties for Ned Eckersley and an unbeaten 78 for Ben Raine. <strong>Worcestershire</strong> were then bowled out for 151 with Chris Rushworth bustling his way to four wickets.</p> <p><strong>Northamptonshire</strong>\u2019s Temba Bavuma held the batting together with a hundred against <strong>Derbyshire</strong>; while <strong>Glamorgan</strong> were in a hole at Sophia Gardens after being bowled out for 171 by <strong>Middlesex</strong>.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2b5eca8f08cf92bb76fbef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T16:56:49.093Z\">5.56pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Parky is on.</strong></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5d2b5b9d8f08cf92bb76fbd9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-14T16:44:49.735Z\">5.44pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Lancashire declare </strong>- I suspect this match is about to change gear.

      "bodyText": "As England\u2019s players played the biggest game of their lifetimes, county cricket skipped along, humming a merry tune. While many wondered why the World Cup Sunday, of all Sundays, had not been left free from county cricket, 500 or so doughty Lancashire supporters came through the turnstiles. Bafflement crossed the face of a spectator asked why he had not stayed at home to watch the World Cup final: \u201cWhy would we watch the television when you can watch Rob Jones bat?\u201d The aforementioned Jones made a very pretty 88, Glenn Maxwell, fresh from Australia\u2019s World Cup squad, 59, and the in-form Dane Vilas a century as Lancashire declared six short of 500 against a Sussex attack missing Chris Jordan (injured) and Ollie Robinson (with the Lions.) Sussex survived four overs before the close. Amar Virdi made a mockery of Nottinghamshire\u2019s decision to prepare a spinning pitch for their new import Ravi Ashwin at Trent Bridge. In his first Championship appearance of the season, having been given some \u201ctough love\u201d by Surrey, he took eight for 61 as Notts were dismissed for 116. Young Jamie Smith made 57 as Surrey built a lead of 308 despite the magic of Ashwin, who took four more wickets, giving him 10 in the match. At Chelmsford, Warwickshire\u2019s shorn batting stumbled to 161, with Peter Siddle taking five for 33. Darren Stevens again danced the dance of everlasting youth with his second five-fer in successive games, but only as Hampshire declared on 409 for nine. An unbeaten century from Joe Denly and 94 from Daniel Bell-Drummond took Kent past 300. Somerset suffered one of their worst days in the Championship this season as Yorkshire continued to take advantage of a Gregory and Leach-less opposition, passing 500 with Tom Kohler-Cadmore and Harry Brook notching up their first Championship centuries of the season. Somerset had wobbled to 76 for four at the close. At the Riverside, Durham reached the heady heights of 212, from 47 for six, with fifties for Ned Eckersley and an unbeaten 78 for Ben Raine. Worcestershire were then bowled out for 151 with Chris Rushworth bustling his way to four wickets. Northamptonshire\u2019s Temba Bavuma held the batting together with a hundred against Derbyshire; while Glamorgan were in a hole at Sophia Gardens after being bowled out for 171 by Middlesex. Parky is on. Lancashire declare - I suspect this match is about to change gear. A partnership of 123 between Croft 31, and Vilas not out 132. And New Zealand lose a review... Ravi Ashwin ten-fer, but Surrey lead by 275. Somerset in deep swampy waters at 40-3 following Yorkshire\u2019s huge first-innings score. Essex\u2019s openers in no trouble against Warwicks, and a hundred for Joe Denly at the Rose Bowl! Worcestershire - gulp - 113 for seven, Middlesex 104 for 4 - but the lead is already 317; Bavuma eventually out for 134 at Chesterfield. Couple of near-misses at Lord\u2019s, patient building block time. Yes. Yes? Yes! Thought you\u2019d enjoy this... That\u2019s the hundred for Vilas - his twentieth first-class and fifth for Lancashire! I\u2019m told that his conversion rate from hundred to 150 is \u201cseriously weird.\u201d Back in the OT box - jinx block fully activated - we reckon it\u2019s Jos Buttler\u2019s moment. I\u2019m not sure anyone is still here, but just to say I\u2019ve got to get a round-up in early, so I\u2019m around but will update intermitently. Somerset -eek- 8/1. And fifty for Jamie Smith against Ravi Ashwin! He raises his bat at Bunsen Bridge after a classy straight drive for four and has now the second highest score of the match, plus a forty in the first innings. Real Deal.? Getting a bit nervy at Lord\u2019s ho! Meanwhile, a belated klaxon for Bavuma at Chesterfield - not out 117 with no-one else scoring more than 38. Northants 258-6. That was Harry Brook\u2019s first Championship century of the season, following Tom Kohler-Cadmore\u2019s earlier. Somerset\u2019s Gregory and Leach-less attack playing Yorkies into form. Let\u2019s see how Somerset\u2019s batting fares.... DIVISION ONE Chelmsford Essex 245 (Cook 84; Rhodes 5-17) v Warwickshire 161 (Siddle 5-33) Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) v Kent 158-2 (Denly 68) Trent Bridge: Notts 116 (Virdi 8-61) v Surrey 240 (Ashwin 6-69) and 78-4 (Ashwin 3-34) Headingley: Yorkshire 520 (Ballance 111, Kohler-Cadmore 102, Brook 101; Bess 4-130) v Somerset DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 212 (Eckersley 50, Raine 78 not out) v Worcestershire 72-3 Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 171 (Lloyd 67; Helm 5-53; Roland-Jones 4-45) v Middlesex 384 (Malan 166; Carey 4-54) and 49-3 Old Trafford: Lancashire 371-5 (Jones 88, Vilas 52 not out) v Sussex 127 (Parkinson 6-23) Chesterfield: Day 1: Derby v Northants 255-5 (Bavuma 115) Rob Jones is bowled for 88 - NO! - one that shot through. Vilas has made his seventh fifty of the season. Lancashire 371-5 and it\u2019s tea here at OT too. Scores to follow. Ravi Ashwin bowls Scott Borthwick at The Oval as they all retire for a mid-afternoon cherry bakewell. Surrey 78 for four but a lead already of 202 on this Trent Bridge bunsen. A thought for anyone simultaneously watching tv to ponder: Kent\u2019s Matt Henry still cutting it in the black shirt. Great catch by Latham. Gareth Harte breaks up a 22 run partnership at the Riverside. Worcestershire 56 for three, trail Durham by 156. My money\u2019s on this being a close one- two wobbly batting sides continually saved by their bowlers. Looking ahead to the August fixtures... Kent v Essex at Canterbury maybe the tastiest in Div one - if you assume (dangerous I know) that Somerset swat away Warwicks at Edgbaston. Yorkshire v Notts at Scarborough could be torturous for Notts in a season of continual torment. In Div Two, I fancy Glamorgan v Lancs at Colwyn Bay. Maharaj goes at last - who knew he had such a taste for the long handle? Yorkshire reach the giddy heights of 505-8. We wait for Act II. Bess 4-123 against his old-new-old loan county. Glad to see young Jamie Smith batting well at The Oval against Ravi Ashwin. Surrey\u2019s injury crisis has thrown him in at the deep end - seems he has that golden touch everyone was talking about. Oh my, Jason Roy is a lucky boy.... Rob Jones and Dane Vilas bring up the fifty partnership and the lead over Sussex passes 200. Should have mentioned that Chris Jordan hurt his knee yesterday and won\u2019t bowl today. Lancs 333-4. Another for Ravi Ashwin - Surrey 34 for 3. A lead of 158. Is it enough? **(Rhetorical question) Hail Rushworth, full of grace fire. Daryl Michell gone for a duck as Worcestershire wobble at 17 for 1. Durham were all out for 212 with Ben Raine stranded on 78. And suddenly Toby Roland Jones has four! Go TRJ! Glamorgan what is this stumble, trip? They\u2019ve lost four for ten and are 157 for nine with only three players in double figures. Amusing goings on at Trent Bridge or, to nick a BTL suggestion, Bridgeabad. Surrey 13 for two, with the two spinners Ravi Ashwin and Liam Patterson-White opening the bowling. Quick catch-up. Notts were all out for 116 with Virdi 8-61. That\u2019s quite some entrance. Gives Surrey a lead of 126 as they start their second innings. Warwickshire, shorn of Dom Sibley and Sam Hain limp on, 83 for five. Kent are batting, 56 for one, and Yorks go on, and on, and on - Harry Brook 72 not out, Yorks 434-7. Also... the tofu looks tasty. Sorry about the post-lunch silence. I ventured into the stands to see why people had made the trek to Old Trafford rather than watch England contest the World Cup Final on telly. Here is a cross-section of the answers, some more tongue in cheek than others.... \u201cWe\u2019re talking agricultural cricket versus non-agricultural cricket.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t cross the road to watch international one-day cricket.\u201d \u201cBut it brings in all the money so its very good of it to subsidise county cricket.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t watch a game where the players aren\u2019t dressed properly.\u201d \u201cCricket has to be over four days - unless it is minor counties cricket.\u201d \u201cWhy would we watch the television when you can watch Rob Jones bat?\u201d \u201cWhat you\u2019ve got to remember is that we\u2019re all good friends...\u201d \u201cWell we were this morning..\u201d Lancashire 296-4. Lovely shot by Glenn Maxwell to break the post-lunch lull: Sussex have take n the new ball and Hamza has it. Lancs 266/3. DIVISION ONE Chelmsford Essex 254 (Cook 84; Rhodes 5-17) v Warwickshire 57-4 Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 409-9 dec (Organ 100, Rossouw 92; Stevens 5-68) v Kent 14-0 Trent Bridge: Notts 104-7 (Virdi 5-59) v Surrey 240 (Ashwin 6-69) Headingley: Yorkshire 386-6 (Ballance 111, Kohler-Cadmore 102) v Somerset DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 209-8 (Eckersley 50, Raine 77 not out) v Worcestershire Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 128-5 (Lloyd 54 not out; Helm 4-41) v Middlesex 384 (Malan 166; Carey 4-54) Old Trafford: Lancashire 255-3 v Sussex 127 (Parkinson 6-23) Chesterfield: Day 1: Derby v Northants 66-3 Lunch scores to follow! A fabulous little sweep shot by Rob Jones takes Lancs to 243 and a feet-up, telly on, relaxed lunch. Apropos of nothing, I see the World Cup OBO is the most read item across the Guardian! Here\u2019s the link. Also, as it bows out, a shout out to this World Cup. A couple of days ago I got a message out of the blue from the only other girl in my class at secondary school who liked cricket. I\u2019ve not seen her since I was 16. We occasionally used to bump into each other at Lord\u2019s where we went with our respective dads but more usually hung out in the toilets after school where she\u2019d put on mascara and I\u2019d look on and try and copy her hair style. She just wrote to say how great the semi-final had been. So thank you cricket for extending the hand of friendship, and thank you Nicola. Meanwhile, Notts are 94 for 7, Warwicks 49-4 and Hants 409-9 declared. Virdi back with a swing, a swagger, and a bang. Opening the bowling, he\u2019s got five for 39 against Notts. Alec Stewart spoke last week of the \u201ctough love\u201d Surrey have shown Virdi, and that he has to understand what being a professional sportsman means, ie - he\u2019s not been fit enough. Seems to have worked ok! Notts 89 for 7. In Division Two, Durham\u2019s late flurry has been ended by Ed Barnard. Ned Eckersley gone for 50 but Ben Raine still hanging on, 49 not out. Durham 169-7. At Sophia Gardens, David Lloyd is still there on 43 but Billy Root Roland-Jonesed for 32. Glamorgan 103-5. Ah, and in the game starting today, Northants 62-3, a wicket for Derby\u2019s young Hudson-Prentice. A second five-fer in two games for roly-poly Darren Stevens, champion of the forty-plus club. Hampshire 402-9. Oh dear Warwickshire - 27-3. A wicket for young Aaron Beard. Ashwin and Patel rowing Notts towards three figures - 65-5. And Somerset have taken three wickets this morning, Yorkshire 351-6. Meanwhile in Trafalgar square: And Mullaney falls for a duck, lbw first ball. NOTTS 41-5. McManus hovers just short of fifty for Hampshire as they pile up dem runs at the Rose Bowl, and Libby falls to Virdi at Trent Bridge on a dry used surface. Actually Notts are now 40-4, having lost three for five. Virdi 2-25. Normal service resumes. And Hass goes, I\u2019m afraid, for 11, lbw Wiese. Lancs 184-3. Not a great start for Warwickshire as Essex sniff the air from Headingley and apply the hunting knife. Warwicks 14- 2, wickets for Siddle and Quinn. Yorkshire (305-3) collect their third batting point, and Glamorgan start climbing out the hole at Sophia Gardens as Billy Root and David Lloyd rebuild (Glamorgan 69-4). Wow! Jennings cut to backward point and Rawlings leaps left and high. Paul Edwards says you won\u2019t see a better catch than that at Lord\u2019s (bah humbug!). Lancs 166-2. Lots of people wondering why County Cricket is happening now, of all weekends. It does seem peculiar, especially as the ECB has been building towards England being in the Final for four years. This was their EVERYTHING! But having said that, there are a surprising number of people here - 300 or so. And a number I can\u2019t see who are in the pavilion, gazing up at the screens, as Paul Edwards says, \u201cas if witnessing the second coming.\u201d And that\u2019s a lovely shot by Hameed. Lancashire 166-1. Just asking around about Matt Parkinson for your benefit. General consensus is that there is no great conspiracy around his non-selection. Just that Lancashire\u2019s seam attack has been so good and they\u2019ve been playing on largely seaming wickets. At the beginning of the season they had Glenn Maxwell, who can turn his arm over, then Livingstone. Parry was picked last week because he\u2019s the one who has been bowling slightly better in the seconds. Parkinson himself seemed phlegmatic about it, and said yesterday that he\u2019d become resigned to playing just white ball cricket this season. \u201cI\u2019ve had to bide my time and I\u2019d sort of resigned myself to playing T20 for the next month, so it\u2019s nice to go out there and do well. But you can\u2019t fault our seam attack because there isn\u2019t a better one in the country.\u201d DIVISION ONE Chelmsford: Essex 245 v Warwickshire Ageas Bowl: Hampshire 340-6 v Kent Trent Bridge: Notts 20-1 v Surrey 240 Headingley: Yorkshire 282-3 v Somerset DIVISION TWO Riverside: Durham 122-6 v Worcestershire Sophia Gardens: Glamorgan 25-4 v Middlesex 384 Old Trafford: Lancashire 149-1 v Sussex 127 Chesterfield: Day 1: Derby v Northants In Division One, it is even stevens at Chelmsford with five wickets for Will Rhodes. Young Felix Organ made his maiden hundred for Hampshire against Kent. I\u2019m feeling there could be a Notts-up in waiting against Surrey (20-1) and a century for Gary Ballance has put Yorkshire in a strong position against Division One leaders Somerset. Now for a quick round-up from yesterday: Division Two Matt Parkinson fulfilled the fantasty of many BTL taking by a career-best six for 23 with his legspin from 15.2 overs after Sussex collapsed from 77 for 1 to lose five for 11. Lancashire had over taken Sussex by the close for the loss of only one wicket - Alex Davies for 72. Keaton returns with an unbeaten fifty. Glamorgan collapsed against Middlesex, with Tom Helm taking four for 8. David Malan earlier made a super 166. And Durham are in trouble against Worcestershire, after Cameron Bancroft failed. Derby and Northants start today at Chesterfield, as does the Lions match against Australia A. Here is the scene at Wombat CC, where the final day of English Women\u2019s county cricket as we know it is being played between Devon and Somerset. Good morning everyone - anyone? -from Old Trafford and welcome to the most important day in English cricket since....The Oval Test of 2005? Headingley \u201881? Bodyline? I can just see an elderly man in a blue shirt and white hair climbing the stairs of Stand A - he doesn\u2019t have many companions. A scattering in the pavilion and another handful here in the press box ,where I\u2019ve just watched Kane Williamson win the toss. Out on the pitch Lancashire are playing volleyball and Sussex have had circle time (shoes on) after their disastrous day yesterday. This was Jason Gillespie\u2019s summary: \u201cWe spoke this morning about the importance of adapting to conditions but we can have time meeting after team meeting after team meeting, if we\u2019re getting rissoled for a hundred each time, we may as well be banging our heads against a brick wall.We know it\u2019s not good enough. It is unacceptable. The brutal reality is that our top six batters are not doing their jobs and they need to find a way to get the job done.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>This was the most astonishing, fortuitous, preposterous climax to any cricket match I\u2019ve witnessed, let alone a World Cup final. Only the Kiwis could have coped so graciously with the manner of their defeat in the most riveting final this tournament has ever witnessed. At the end of it England emerged as World Cup winners for the first time. It is hard to believe how they managed it. We had better start at the end.</p> \n<p>The game had been gripping throughout. But in the final over it had more twists and turns than a Hitchcock thriller. England needed 15 runs to win from the last over, which was bowled by Trent Boult. Ben Stokes was on strike with two wickets remaining.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/14/new-zealand-v-england-cricket-world-cup-final-2019-live\">England win Cricket World Cup final after super-over drama against New Zealand \u2013 live reaction!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The first two deliveries produced nothing. Stokes hit the fielders and declined to run; the crowd, at least the majority of them, groaned. Stokes hit the next ball over midwicket for six. Nine runs were now needed from three balls.</p> \n<p>Now comes the twist that few scriptwriters could ever have conceived. Stokes heaved again and the ball sped to midwicket. Martin Guptill swooped and sent it back to the wicketkeeper\u2019s end to which Stokes was sprinting to complete a second run. He dived desperately for safety; the ball struck his bat and was consequently redirected towards the pavilion. There was a frantic pursuit but no Kiwi could stop it.</p> \n<p>In these circumstances the etiquette is that the batsmen should not run, which was observed by the two England players. But once the ball had crossed the boundary the umpires had no alternative but to signal that six runs had been scored. Two had been run plus the four overthrows. Three runs were now needed off two balls. Stokes hit to long on and Adil Rashid was run out at the bowler\u2019s end seeking a second. No matter. Two needed from one ball. This time Stokes intentionally patted to long on calculating that they could scramble two runs. A perfect throw came from Jimmy Neesham and Mark Wood was nowhere to be seen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf2f619ffc333ca85110ecf890e687c6329d0afd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf2f619ffc333ca85110ecf890e687c6329d0afd/78_199_4209_2525/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos Buttler wheels away in celebration after running out Martin Guptill in the deciding super over\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jos Buttler wheels away in celebration after running out Martin Guptill in the deciding super over</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And so the match was tied and we moved to the super over, cricket\u2019s equivalent to the penalty shootout. Out came Stokes again along with Jos Buttler. Once again Boult had the ball. England mustered 15 runs. So now New Zealand, on the verge of victory 20 minutes earlier, needed 16 to win the World Cup. Out came Neesham and Guptill. Jofra Archer was given the dubious honour of bowling, quite a compliment for the novice. A wide was followed by a mighty six from Neesham; then a misfield and we were back in familiar territory. Three runs needed off two balls, then two from the last one. It was established that if the match was tied England would win on the relatively random basis that they had hit more boundaries in the match. Guptill hit to midwicket.

      "bodyText": "This was the most astonishing, fortuitous, preposterous climax to any cricket match I\u2019ve witnessed, let alone a World Cup final. Only the Kiwis could have coped so graciously with the manner of their defeat in the most riveting final this tournament has ever witnessed. At the end of it England emerged as World Cup winners for the first time. It is hard to believe how they managed it. We had better start at the end. The game had been gripping throughout. But in the final over it had more twists and turns than a Hitchcock thriller. England needed 15 runs to win from the last over, which was bowled by Trent Boult. Ben Stokes was on strike with two wickets remaining. The first two deliveries produced nothing. Stokes hit the fielders and declined to run; the crowd, at least the majority of them, groaned. Stokes hit the next ball over midwicket for six. Nine runs were now needed from three balls. Now comes the twist that few scriptwriters could ever have conceived. Stokes heaved again and the ball sped to midwicket. Martin Guptill swooped and sent it back to the wicketkeeper\u2019s end to which Stokes was sprinting to complete a second run. He dived desperately for safety; the ball struck his bat and was consequently redirected towards the pavilion. There was a frantic pursuit but no Kiwi could stop it. In these circumstances the etiquette is that the batsmen should not run, which was observed by the two England players. But once the ball had crossed the boundary the umpires had no alternative but to signal that six runs had been scored. Two had been run plus the four overthrows. Three runs were now needed off two balls. Stokes hit to long on and Adil Rashid was run out at the bowler\u2019s end seeking a second. No matter. Two needed from one ball. This time Stokes intentionally patted to long on calculating that they could scramble two runs. A perfect throw came from Jimmy Neesham and Mark Wood was nowhere to be seen. And so the match was tied and we moved to the super over, cricket\u2019s equivalent to the penalty shootout. Out came Stokes again along with Jos Buttler. Once again Boult had the ball. England mustered 15 runs. So now New Zealand, on the verge of victory 20 minutes earlier, needed 16 to win the World Cup. Out came Neesham and Guptill. Jofra Archer was given the dubious honour of bowling, quite a compliment for the novice. A wide was followed by a mighty six from Neesham; then a misfield and we were back in familiar territory. Three runs needed off two balls, then two from the last one. It was established that if the match was tied England would win on the relatively random basis that they had hit more boundaries in the match. Guptill hit to midwicket. Jason Roy\u2019s throw was far from perfect but Buttler gathered it and dived for the stumps with Guptill a yard adrift. Somehow England could celebrate victory, yet no sane cricket fan in the ground could conclude that New Zealand deserved to lose. After this surreal hour they emerged with as much credit as England, maybe more, since the cricketing deities had been so cruel. Throughout New Zealand had been at their most resilient in what seemed destined to be a slow burning classic that must have enthralled an enlarged audience, whatever their age or gender.

      "body": "<p>After a long tumble into disgrace and confusion that dates back well over a year, the story playing out at the top of the Labour party increasingly seems to be so dreadful that it defies belief. Jeremy Corbyn is doing a very good impression of someone who would rather be anywhere else. The party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/09/corbyn-says-labour-would-back-remain-in-brexit-referendum\" title=\"\">supposed leap forward on Brexit policy</a> seems to have resulted in a stance not quite as bamboozling as the one it replaced, but it is still surrounded by unanswered questions; the leadership\u2019s dearth of collective energy as the agenda of a Boris Johnson government takes shape is miserable to behold.

This view is often part of the kind of political restorationism lately manifested in nostalgia for the Tony Blair years, and the idea that if only we could go back to an unspecified time between 1997 and 2006, everything would be OK. The broadcast media tends to privilege this view of things, along with Corbyn-till-I-die posturing: the result, as evidenced by what happened on TV and radio last week, is the seemingly daily spectacle of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNewsnight/status/1149438665560428544\" title=\"\">backers of the leader duking it out with older, often jaded people</a> who treat them and their politics as something almost beneath contempt.</p> <p>At which point, a reminder: four years ago, to his own evident shock, Corbyn raced ahead in the Labour leadership contest that followed the election defeat of 2015 for a set of clear and undeniable reasons. For all that Andy Burnham and Yvette Cooper have since risen to be, respectively, the mayor of Greater Manchester and one of the most impressive Commons critics of the Tories, the vapid offerings of his adversaries in the contest (the third, you may recall, was the Leicester MP Liz Kendall) was plain to see. In the moment, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/30/jeremy-corbyn-labour-leadership-clarity-under-30s-human-factors\" title=\"\">it was very exciting to see so many people gathering</a>, both in the real world and online, to voice their opposition to austerity, the cruelties of the modern benefits system, homelessness, and all the other moral outrages of 21st-century Britain.</p> <p>Around this time, a lot of people became Labour party members \u2013 and are still involved \u2013 for the most straightforward of reasons. When<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/16/momentum-labour-party-jeremy-corbyn-politics-john-harris\" title=\"\"> I went to an early Momentum gathering in Kent</a>, I met a woman who told me she had never considered of any kind of activism before, that she lived \u201cconstantly on the poverty line\u201d, Labour was at last speaking to her predicament, and that Corbyn offered an alternative to \u201chow people think a politician should talk, and look\u201d. Thousands of people had their own version of this story, and as evidenced by the yearly Labour-aligned festival of ideas titled The World Transformed, many of them soon set about creating a largely open and thoughtful \u2013 and passionately green - movement that brimmed with energy and ideas.</p> <p>But thanks to an accident of history, these people\u2019s politics came to sit alongside and often blur into a cliquey, closed-off strand whose roots go back into the mists of the British left\u2019s past. Alongside a belief in top-down power structures, among its key features are hostility towards the EU, and an affinity with the old Soviet Union that is now manifested in sympathy with Vladimir Putin. These things go with the grain of a supposed anti-imperialism that doesn\u2019t only criticise US foreign policy and Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians, but sees those things as unsurpassable evils. All too often, its adherents seem to apply entirely different moral standards to events depending on who is held to be responsible (witness responses to foreign intervention by Russia and the US), and keep the company of very rum people indeed: the tendency of some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/sep/05/jewish-concern-corbyn-israel-palestine-antisemitism-ihra\" title=\"\">anti-imperialists</a> to associate with <a href=\"https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/corbyn-won-t-back-away-from-salah-1.33044\" title=\"\">or endorse antisemites</a> is part of the reason why Labour\u2019s current problems started in the first place. </p> <p>At the grassroots, this stuff tends to be voiced by the kind of Labour member who often believes in a tangle of conspiracy theory, interprets most challenges to Corbyn as evidence of plots and hidden schemes, and sees alarm on the left about Brexit as a bourgeois indulgence. Higher up the party hierarchy, in a much more controlled and outwardly sensible form, a related set of views is there in Corbyn\u2019s own politics, and those of such far-left veterans as his chief of strategy, Seumas Milne, and the leader\u2019s close adviser Andrew Murray, both of whom who cut their teeth in the culture around doctrinaire British communism, and the political forces who eventually formed the deeply inconsistent and compromised Stop the War coalition.</p> <p>The separation between these factions and the new Labour party\u2019s more modern elements is not always clear: out of loyalty to the Corbyn project, the latter often defend and support the former. But nonetheless, in the awkward fit between them there lie issues that the left\u2019s polarised discourse has so far overlooked. Why, if you want British society to be radically changed, the climate emergency tackled via a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/22/labour-members-launch-green-new-deal-inspired-by-us-activists\" title=\"\">Green New Deal</a> and the basic notions of democracy and empowerment rolled out into the economy as well as the political system, does that agenda have to be coupled with fringe ideas that only speak to a tiny minority of people, and have played a key role in Labour\u2019s current mess? Put another way, why does 21st-century socialism have to be bundled up with all this weird stuff?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/end-the-antisemitism-soap-opera-emily-thornberry-tells-labour\">End the antisemitism soap opera, Emily Thornberry tells Labour</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even if it has yet to cohere into a convincing narrative, there is an abundance of good ideas in and around Labour and the left, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/07/labour-would-break-up-treasury-and-create-northern-no-11-says-john-mcdonnell\" title=\"\">John McDonnell\u2019s plans to break up the Treasury</a> and move a lot of its work to the north of England, through ideas about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/10/labour-delist-uk-firms-failing-to-fight-climate-change-john-mcdonnell\" title=\"\">punishing companies that fail to pull their weight on climate change</a>, and on to mounting a push to make co-operatives a central part of the economy.

When I went to an early Momentum gathering in Kent, I met a woman who told me she had never considered of any kind of activism before, that she lived \u201cconstantly on the poverty line\u201d, Labour was at last speaking to her predicament, and that Corbyn offered an alternative to \u201chow people think a politician should talk, and look\u201d. Thousands of people had their own version of this story, and as evidenced by the yearly Labour-aligned festival of ideas titled The World Transformed, many of them soon set about creating a largely open and thoughtful \u2013 and passionately green - movement that brimmed with energy and ideas. But thanks to an accident of history, these people\u2019s politics came to sit alongside and often blur into a cliquey, closed-off strand whose roots go back into the mists of the British left\u2019s past. Alongside a belief in top-down power structures, among its key features are hostility towards the EU, and an affinity with the old Soviet Union that is now manifested in sympathy with Vladimir Putin. These things go with the grain of a supposed anti-imperialism that doesn\u2019t only criticise US foreign policy and Israel\u2019s treatment of the Palestinians, but sees those things as unsurpassable evils. All too often, its adherents seem to apply entirely different moral standards to events depending on who is held to be responsible (witness responses to foreign intervention by Russia and the US), and keep the company of very rum people indeed: the tendency of some anti-imperialists to associate with or endorse antisemites is part of the reason why Labour\u2019s current problems started in the first place. At the grassroots, this stuff tends to be voiced by the kind of Labour member who often believes in a tangle of conspiracy theory, interprets most challenges to Corbyn as evidence of plots and hidden schemes, and sees alarm on the left about Brexit as a bourgeois indulgence. Higher up the party hierarchy, in a much more controlled and outwardly sensible form, a related set of views is there in Corbyn\u2019s own politics, and those of such far-left veterans as his chief of strategy, Seumas Milne, and the leader\u2019s close adviser Andrew Murray, both of whom who cut their teeth in the culture around doctrinaire British communism, and the political forces who eventually formed the deeply inconsistent and compromised Stop the War coalition. The separation between these factions and the new Labour party\u2019s more modern elements is not always clear: out of loyalty to the Corbyn project, the latter often defend and support the former. But nonetheless, in the awkward fit between them there lie issues that the left\u2019s polarised discourse has so far overlooked. Why, if you want British society to be radically changed, the climate emergency tackled via a Green New Deal and the basic notions of democracy and empowerment rolled out into the economy as well as the political system, does that agenda have to be coupled with fringe ideas that only speak to a tiny minority of people, and have played a key role in Labour\u2019s current mess? Put another way, why does 21st-century socialism have to be bundled up with all this weird stuff? Even if it has yet to cohere into a convincing narrative, there is an abundance of good ideas in and around Labour and the left, from John McDonnell\u2019s plans to break up the Treasury and move a lot of its work to the north of England, through ideas about punishing companies that fail to pull their weight on climate change, and on to mounting a push to make co-operatives a central part of the economy. By an accident of timing, the night last week\u2019s Panorama about Labour and antisemitism aired, I was in the basement of the HQ of the trade union Unite, speaking about a report jointly authored by the Runnymede Trust and the Corbyn-aligned thinktank Class, about the modern working-class experience in London, and a set of policy proposals that ranged from a set of universal citizen entitlements to housing, transport and internet access, to the end of the sell-off of public land. Such organisations as the Institute for Public Policy Research and the New Economics Foundation are developing the central idea of the drastic redistribution of power into exciting, trailblazing work. This has to be Labour\u2019s future. As Britain edges closer to a post-Brexit reality in which the political right will do its utmost to snuff out whatever residues of collectivism and solidarity we have left, Labour urgently needs to attend to it. Whether it can do so while its collective politics is so messed-up, inconsistent and toxic is the question that is already starting to decide its fate. \u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist",

In its latest business outlook report, released on Monday, Deloitte says Australia\u2019s economic slowdown appears \u201cwell contained\u201d with national income growth on track and stimulus arriving fast in the form of income tax reductions, rate cuts and looser lending rules. The relatively rosy assessment follows a meeting between the Reserve Bank governor, Philip Lowe, and the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, on Thursday, at which Lowe tempered his earlier warnings that the government must do more to stimulate the economy. Australia\u2019s economy grew just 0.4% in the March quarter, contributing to a 10-year low annual growth rate of 1.8%, and two consecutive cuts \u2013 of 25 percentage points each \u2013 in the cash rate by the RBA in June and July. Deloitte attributed the economic slowdown to falling house prices and the drought, but noted that national income growth remained at its long-term average because of higher coal and iron prices. It said the RBA was cutting rates not just because \u201cthe economy is slower than it was, but mainly because the economy has been slower than it needed to be\u201d \u2013 as it aimed to reduce unemployment from 5.2% to 4.5% to lift wages and push inflation back into the 2-3% target band.

      "bodyText": "An independent expert report found that a 23-year-old man who died at the Defqon.1 music festival last year may have survived if he\u2019d received better care at the event. Joseph Pham, 23, was one of two young people who died after taking MDMA at the Defqon.1 festival in western Sydney last September. Along with Diana Nguyen, 21, who also died after attending the event, he is one of the six people whose deaths from MDMA toxicity are being investigated by the New South Wales coroner. Last week the inquest heard about multiple issues with the medical care provided at some of the festivals and paid particular attention to the service provider EMS, which was employed at Defqon.1. The inquest heard the 30,000-person event had only two doctors on staff, including one, Andrew Beshara, who had never independently intubated a patient. Pham was taken to hospital almost an hour after a doctor said he needed an ambulance, while a NSW Ambulance paramedic who worked at the event described the care provided by EMS as \u201ccompletely abhorrent\u201d. And an expert report prepared by the emergency medicine specialist Associate Professor Anna Holdgate found that Pham may not have died if EMS staff had transferred him to hospital sooner. \u201cIn my opinion, if Joseph had received immediate treatment to lower his body temperature and had been promptly transported to hospital by appropriately skilled NSW Ambulance intensive-care paramedics, he would have arrived at hospital prior to his cardiac arrest and may have been effectively resuscitated,\u201d Holdgate wrote in her report. \u201cWhile it is by no means certain that this would have prevented the fatal outcome, it would certainly have significantly improved his chances of survival.\u201d Both Pham and Nguyen presented separately at the festival\u2019s medical tent within only a few minutes of each other. Pham, who had taken an \u201cunknown number of pills\u201d, was unconscious with an elevated heart rate, while Nguyen, who had taken two pills, was unconscious, \u201cextremely hyperthermic\u201d with low oxygen levels and profusely sweating. With only two doctors at the event, the inquest heard last week that the more senior of the two, Sean Wing, made the decision to prioritise the care of Nguyen who he believed to be in a more dire situation. Pham\u2019s care was left to NSW Ambulance paramedics and the more junior doctor, Beshara. Last week Beshara gave evidence to the inquest that he had asked for Pham to be transported to hospital sooner, and admitted staff at the event felt \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by the situation. \u201cHis jaw was essentially wired shut, his arms and legs were tensed up and he was very stiff,\u201d Beshara told the court. \u201cEssentially from the moment we received him, he would need to be transferred.\u201d He said he told the EMS director Michael Hammond that Pham needed to be transferred to hospital soon after the arrival of Nguyen. \u201cIt\u2019s a statement I expressed loudly,\u201d he said. Holdgate said in her report that at the time of Pham\u2019s presentation at the medical tent he had \u201csigns of significant MDMA toxicity\u201d and that it was clear he would need to be transported to hospital. \u201cHowever, EMS staff did not initiate a plan to transport him to hospital until after he had progressed to cardiac arrest,\u201d she wrote. She wrote that initial testing which showed Pham\u2019s body temperature levels was probably wrong, and that \u201cno treatment for hyperthermia was initiated at any stage either pre-hospital or after he arrived at Nepean hospital\u201d. In her report Holdgate wrote that she had \u201ca number of concerns about the treatment provided by the EMS medical team at the event\u201d. She said medical staff were \u201crapidly overwhelmed\u201d by the number of patients and lacked the skill to manage critically ill patients, apparently \u201crapidly ran out of basic resuscitation equipment\u201d and that medical staff were not adequately skilled to manage critically ill patients. \u201cThe decision-making as to what treatment should be provided on site and when patients should be transferred to hospital was poor,\u201d she wrote. Wing accompanied Nguyen in the ambulance just after 9pm, leaving Beshara \u2013 who had little critical care experience \u2013 as \u201cin effect the chief medical officer\u201d of the facility. \u201cIt seems that Dr Wing attempted to treat both patients as if he was in a well-supported hospital environment rather than a relatively isolated facility with limited physical and human resources,\u201d Holdgate wrote. Last week Wing said he believed Nguyen was dying, and leaving the event with her was a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d. \u201cI felt there was no conceivable alternative in my mind,\u201d he said.",

The report from the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia (CEDA), released on Monday, said that skilled migrants, particularly those on temporary skilled working visas, have been an \u201coverwhelming net positive\u201d for the Australian economy and have not had a negative impact on either the wages or participation rates of Australian-born workers. However, the report said that despite economic evidence suggesting migration is a positive, \u201cgovernments have responded to community concern with a seeming revolving door of reviews, reports and frequent policy changes to Australia\u2019s temporary skilled migration program\u201d. The latest policy change was the replacement of the 457 visa scheme with the temporary skill shortage visa scheme, which came into force in March 2018. The then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the change was intended to ensure that Australians had priority for Australian jobs, because the 457 scheme had \u201clost its credibility\u201d. The new visas are available for two to four years for a reduced range of occupations, for which most would require mandatory labour market testing. But the report said the change surprised the business community because of a lack of consultation. It has recommended a suite of reforms including introducing a streamlined path to make it easier for global companies to transfer employees to Australia; introducing a more transparent system for identifying areas of skill shortage; removing the requirement for labour market testing, which it says is \u201cinflexible\u201d; and getting the Productivity Commission to review the temporary skill shortage program at least every five years. It has also recommended that the levy paid by businesses who sponsor a skilled migrant, which goes into the Skilling Australia Fund, should not be payable until a visa application has been accepted, and that the use of the fund be better targeted to alleviate the skill shortage that prompted the visa application, rather than on unrelated training.

Earlier this year, Suns CEO Mark Evans said that if the AFL were to establish an expansion club into a foreign market you would have to establish a \u201c15 to 20-year play\u201d. His club is now in its ninth year in the AFL and having been pasted by over 90 points in consecutive weeks even a 30-year play seems sanguine \u2013 and that\u2019s with three players taken inside the top 10 at the national draft last year. While it is in line with many preseason predictions, Gold Coast will now almost surely win the wooden spoon with its dozenth straight loss, a game plus a whack of percentage behind a Carlton that has been Teagued back into relevance. Just days after Gold Coast chairman Tony Cochrane called for his club to receive a priority pick, his players made a case for them receiving six. Why not? The AFL has already thrown them close to $50m in the past two years. \u201cSunken costs\u201d seems an apt economic term to use given the state of these Suns. After that, Gillon McLachlan should get in a light plane, fly across Bass Strait and rain down a great deal of horseshit on AFL Tasmania. It would only be slightly more farcical than the performance at Metricon Stadium on Saturday night \u2013 one that drew plenty of laughs from the Adelaide coaches\u2019 box, much to the annoyance of Dew. \u201cLook at the Crows coaches\u2019 box in the last quarter there. So, that stings. It\u2019s got to sting. That\u2019s where we\u2019re at. That\u2019s what they think of us,\u201d he said. Someone also needs to keep him away from a computer, as even Wikipedia was in on the act, albeit temporarily. \u201cThe Gold Coast Suns, also known simply as Gold Coast are the worst team in the history of AFL. So much so that even Fitzroy laugh at them,\u201d the team\u2019s entry briefly read. Unfortunately for the Suns, the only time they are given much thought now is if your team has them in the next six weeks and need to work themselves back into form, much the way Eddie Betts did on Saturday night. Losers. We love \u2018em. For the league\u2019s other expansion team, GWS Giants, that opportunity may arrive too late, in Round 23. On Sunday at the MCG as the clouds overhead conspired to shut out the sun, Richmond \u2013 who recalled spearhead Jack Riewoldt for his first game since round six \u2013 shut out a Giants team that continues to underwhelm after a fourth defeat in five games and an injury to Stephen Coniglio that, given the state of GWS\u2019s fading premiership ambitions, is probably a bigger deal in the context of the restricted free agent\u2019s contract negotiations. Having slogged through winter with many of its stars in street clothes the Tigers are now eyeing a top-four berth, having leapt ahead of the Giants on the ladder. Although it\u2019s becoming more and more difficult to see the Brisbane Lions surrendering their spot in the top-four after dismantling a powerless Port Adelaide who continue to be football\u2019s From Dawn Til Dusk \u2013 an all guns blazing shoot \u2018em up Western one moment and zombie-like the next. This is to take nothing away from the Lions, whose four goals in the first eight minutes set-up another impressive win in what is becoming an impressive body of work, and everything that their Queensland neighbours are not \u2013 fun, exciting, watchable and winners. And nearly ten years after trying to boot the Fitzroy Lions to the kerb, Brisbane has also embraced a past that gives them a history that dates back to 1883, just eight years after the Gold Coast was first surveyed. In surveying the current state of play it is hard to think that with Essendon\u2019s last-gasp win over North Melbourne on Saturday night the eight is now not set. About the only team outside the eight you could make a case for is the Western Bulldogs who held off a persistent Melbourne at Marvel Stadium on Sunday afternoon, thanks largely to one of the best games of the year from Josh Dunkley whose 39 disposals and two goals make for better reading than the miserable percentage that effectively has the Bulldogs two games out from playing finals this year. But insofar as miserable numbers go that title this year, it seems, belongs to the Suns.",

      "body": "<p>The United Kingdom is a few months away from crashing out of the European Union, the main opposition party is engaged in political fratricide and the country faces the highest risk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/13/urgent-planning-needed-to-combat-looming-downturn\" title=\"\">recession</a> since 2007. Yet 160,000 Conservative party members will land us, almost certainly, with yet another <a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/v41/n13/james-wood/diary\" title=\"\">Etonian</a> prime minister, the 20th in our history. Whether the UK ends up being led by Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, one thing is certain: the winner will be the private school sector.</p> \n<p>For all the populist triumphs, the elite are blossoming in this anti-elitist era. Only 7% of the general population have a private education lavished upon them. Yet last month a survey by the Sutton Trust <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/25/britains-top-jobs-still-in-hands-of-private-school-elite-study-finds\" title=\"\">revealed</a> that people in the upper echelons of power were five times more likely to have been privately educated than the general population. It is not just the professions. Even the England cricket team is shown <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/48745093\" title=\"\">increasingly</a> to be the preserve of those who went to private schools.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"1ec9e624-fb4c-47a5-a6f9-f3f36fb6bf53\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/pN36jVSp1x0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Access to such an education is available to wealthy households, and only those with incomes above \u00a3120,000 send children in appreciable numbers to private schools. This walling-off of one section of society from another is damaging. The disparity in funding also creates unequal opportunities. In Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem, by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jan/13/public-schools-david-kynaston-francis-green-engines-of-privilege\" title=\"\">Francis Green and David Kynaston</a>, the authors calculate that private schools spend about three times as much per pupil as the state does. When Mr Johnson makes a <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/social-affairs/children-and-young-people/news/104924/boris-johnson-vows-reverse-tory\" title=\"\">commitment</a> to ensure fair funding across schools in England, he doesn\u2019t mean <a href=\"https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/14194\" title=\"\">levelling</a> the state sector upwards to private school standards so that ordinary students can fairly compete with their richer peers in exams, for access to high-status universities and ultimately similarly attain fortunes in their work lives that reflect their abilities, not their parents\u2019 income.</p> \n<p>There\u2019s no sign that Mr Johnson seeks to replicate the uplift in revenue seen in the private sector for state schools. Over the past 10 years in the state sector there have been 8% cuts in per-pupil school spending, while private school fees have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/39cc1aa0-b11c-11e8-8d14-6f049d06439c\" title=\"\">risen</a> by 49% to an average of \u00a314,289 per student in 2018, about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/12/salary-what-get-paid-talk-about-it-makes-brits-cringe\" title=\"\">half </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/may/12/salary-what-get-paid-talk-about-it-makes-brits-cringe\" title=\"\">the median annual income in the UK for full-time workers</a>. With all this cash sloshing around there ought to be little surprise when private schools hold <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5874703/St-Pauls-Girls-School-slammed-serving-pupils-baked-potatoes-beans-AUSTERITY-DAY-lunch.html\" title=\"\">austerity days</a> and serve standard school fare in their canteens, forgoing without irony a slow-baked Moroccan lamb with broad beans, prunes and preserved lemon lunch. Or why in the 236 private schools in London, 59 have <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/private-schools-upstage-the-west-end-with-cutting-edge-theatres-fhbqxjfwn\" title=\"\">theatres</a> \u2013 replete with cutting-edge technology and modern design \u2013 compared with the West End\u2019s 42 certainly more famous and probably more shabby venues. In Labour there are signs that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/09/labour-phase-out-private-schools-britain-inequality-finland?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\" title=\"\">issue</a> is being revived with an attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/09/abolish-eton-labour-groups-aim-to-strip-elite-private-schools-of-privileges\" title=\"\">harden</a> up the unambitious current policy of putting VAT on private school fees. It\u2019s a far cry from when Neil Kinnock, as Labour\u2019s education spokesman, committed the party in 1980 to <a href=\"http://bufvc.ac.uk/tvandradio/lbc/index.php/segment/0013200008004\" title=\"\">eliminate</a> private schools within a decade.</p> \n<p>Michael Gove, who served as education secretary under David Cameron, has suggested a desire to abolish private schools \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/03/01/michael-gove-would-like-see-end-private-education/\" title=\"\">by stealth</a>\u201d. There is good reason to ask why we permit a section of rich people to secede, in educational terms, from the rest of the nation. What is being purchased is social privilege. It cannot be right that the freedom to spend one\u2019s money to buy a head start in life at the expense of everyone else prevails when the widespread antisocial effects of such practices are so obvious. The temper of the times is to resolve economic and social injustice. Private schools cannot be exempted from that.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said the Sutton Trust report \u201crevealed that the upper echelons of power were five times more likely to be populated by the privately educated than by those who went to state schools\u201d.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The United Kingdom is a few months away from crashing out of the European Union, the main opposition party is engaged in political fratricide and the country faces the highest risk of recession since 2007. Yet 160,000 Conservative party members will land us, almost certainly, with yet another Etonian prime minister, the 20th in our history. Whether the UK ends up being led by Boris Johnson or Jeremy Hunt, one thing is certain: the winner will be the private school sector. For all the populist triumphs, the elite are blossoming in this anti-elitist era. Only 7% of the general population have a private education lavished upon them. Yet last month a survey by the Sutton Trust revealed that people in the upper echelons of power were five times more likely to have been privately educated than the general population. It is not just the professions. Even the England cricket team is shown increasingly to be the preserve of those who went to private schools. Access to such an education is available to wealthy households, and only those with incomes above \u00a3120,000 send children in appreciable numbers to private schools. This walling-off of one section of society from another is damaging. The disparity in funding also creates unequal opportunities. In Engines of Privilege: Britain\u2019s Private School Problem, by Francis Green and David Kynaston, the authors calculate that private schools spend about three times as much per pupil as the state does. When Mr Johnson makes a commitment to ensure fair funding across schools in England, he doesn\u2019t mean levelling the state sector upwards to private school standards so that ordinary students can fairly compete with their richer peers in exams, for access to high-status universities and ultimately similarly attain fortunes in their work lives that reflect their abilities, not their parents\u2019 income. There\u2019s no sign that Mr Johnson seeks to replicate the uplift in revenue seen in the private sector for state schools. Over the past 10 years in the state sector there have been 8% cuts in per-pupil school spending, while private school fees have risen by 49% to an average of \u00a314,289 per student in 2018, about half the median annual income in the UK for full-time workers. With all this cash sloshing around there ought to be little surprise when private schools hold austerity days and serve standard school fare in their canteens, forgoing without irony a slow-baked Moroccan lamb with broad beans, prunes and preserved lemon lunch. Or why in the 236 private schools in London, 59 have theatres \u2013 replete with cutting-edge technology and modern design \u2013 compared with the West End\u2019s 42 certainly more famous and probably more shabby venues. In Labour there are signs that the issue is being revived with an attempt to harden up the unambitious current policy of putting VAT on private school fees. It\u2019s a far cry from when Neil Kinnock, as Labour\u2019s education spokesman, committed the party in 1980 to eliminate private schools within a decade. Michael Gove, who served as education secretary under David Cameron, has suggested a desire to abolish private schools \u201cby stealth\u201d. There is good reason to ask why we permit a section of rich people to secede, in educational terms, from the rest of the nation. What is being purchased is social privilege. It cannot be right that the freedom to spend one\u2019s money to buy a head start in life at the expense of everyone else prevails when the widespread antisocial effects of such practices are so obvious. The temper of the times is to resolve economic and social injustice. Private schools cannot be exempted from that. \u2022 This article was amended on 22 July 2019. An earlier version incorrectly said the Sutton Trust report \u201crevealed that the upper echelons of power were five times more likely to be populated by the privately educated than by those who went to state schools\u201d.",

There must be a bigger focus on releasing artistry to open wide the doors of young minds. It ought to be the case that young people can go where their instinct takes them. The arts enrich people\u2019s lives. Medical science can make us live to 100.

The Labour peer and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg said recently that he dreams of a future in which the creative industries \u2013 film, TV, radio, photography, music, advertising, museums, galleries, literature, video games \u2013 pull the UK from its current slough of despond. He has a point: Britain\u2019s creative industries, according to government figures, were worth \u00a3101.5bn in 2017 and have been <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britains-creative-industries-break-the-100-billion-barrier\" title=\"\">growing at twice the rate of the economy</a> since 2010. In 2019, 2 million people work in these industries. Lord Bragg urges that, playing to our strengths, we should aim for 4 million in 10 or 20 years\u2019 time.

Then there is our second empire: that created by the English language. Never mind that the reason for the triumph of English is the triumph of the United States.

One-day cricket was still a novelty at the time and Bond, in tandem with his players, developed a new, dynamic outlook based around greater fitness, improved fielding, a more aggressive approach to run-getting and greater use of spin bowlers to take the pace off the ball. Wisden named him one of its cricketers of the year in 1971 solely based on his performances as captain, and noted that Bond\u2019s success was down to the fact that \u201cthe players knew him as a great fighter and a good companion \u2013 a man who had played the game the hard way, suffered rebuffs through injury, illness and loss of form, but still remained cheerful\u201d.

Bond retired from Lancashire after the 1972 season at the age of 40, before making an unsuccessful return for one season as player-manager and captain of Nottinghamshire in 1974, the year he also became an England Test selector. He played 362 first-class matches during his career, scoring 12,125 runs at an average of 25.90. After Nottinghamshire he was a manager at Lancashire for a time, before moving to the Isle of Man, where he became head cricket coach at King William\u2019s college and won the island\u2019s table tennis championship. In 1980 he was back in management at his home county, and then became a respected first-class umpire from 1988 to 1997. A down-to-earth character, he retained his close involvement with Lancashire even into his 80s, when he worked part-time as a member of the ground staff at Old Trafford. He is survived by his wife, Florence (nee Fletcher), whom he married in 1955, his daughter, Stephanie, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His son, Wesley, died in 1986. \u2022 Jack (John David) Bond, cricketer, born 6 May 1932; died 11 July 2019",

One account, @UKAmbRichard, was pretending to be that of the UK ambassador to Turkey and appeared to have acquired some Twitter followers. Another, @SGSSIGov, appeared to be masquerading as the government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, a British overseas territory in the southern Atlantic Ocean. Both complaints were made last year by the Foreign Office, which also complained successfully to Twitter in 2017 about an account set up by the Russian broadcaster RT as part of a commemorative project for the centenary of the Russian Revolution. The account, @BritshEmb1917, had been set up by RT and used an image of the Foreign Office\u2019s official crest under a profile identifying it as \u201cthe official Twitter account of the United Kingdom in the Russian Empire\u201d. In the UK, the Department for Transport took action twice last year against accounts pretending to be one of its branches. Twitter removed both accounts \u2013 @DVLAgov_uk and @DVLAgovuk2 \u2013 posed as associated with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which maintains a database of drivers in Britain. The action against Twitter on behalf of Liam Fox was taken by his special advisers last year. The fake Dominic Raab accounts which the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) complained about were @DominicRab and @BrexitRaab. According to DExEU, Twitter instructed the user of the latter account to make it clear that it was a parody. The account was removed and then recreated but had lost all its followers. The Ministry of Defence has been particularly active. Last year, after MoD complaints Twitter removed @UKchiefofstaff, an account apparently pretending to be Gen Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, the army\u2019s chief of the general staff. In 2017 Twitter suspended @gwilliamsonUK, an account named after the then defence minister. It initially ruled that another, @Roytalnavynews, was not in violation of policies but later suspended it, as it did with @RTHonMFallon, which used the name of another then defence secretary.",

Andrea Pasqualon (ITA) Wanty - Gobert Cycling 40 Team Romain Bardet comes home into Brioude to a warm welcome and crosses the finish line at the head of the peloton, but still not troubling the GC upper echelons. Alaphilippe will remain in yellow. A relaxed peloton cruises towards the finish, with Alaphilippe content enough in yellow, Thomas and his team content enough, and even their thoughts perhaps turning to what\u2019s going on in the tennis/cricket/F1. P\u00f6stlberger crosses the line, some five minutes back having made the first major move as today\u2019s race approached its closing stages. The peloton meanwhile is still 7km away from the finish. The top five: 1. Daryl Impey, 2. Tiesj Benoot, 3 Jan Tratnik, 4 Naesen, 5. Stuyven A deserved win for Impey, who timed his attack perfectly and then showed his sprinting smarts when Benoot tried to overhaul him at the last. He finally has a stage win in his seventh Tour. Benoot attacks with 400km to go, overtakes Impey, but it\u2019s only temporary as Impey shows his sprint mastery to counterattack brilliantly, hitting the front again and crossing the line first to take an emotional first Tour de France stage win. A fourth for Mitchelton-Scott. Into the final kilometre, with Impey just ahead of Benoot 1.5km to go: They approach Brioude\u2019s outskirts with the front two are working together as tiredness takes its toll on so many of their pursuers, the gap extended to 17 seconds. The peloton are 14 minutes behind, Sagan and the kings of the mountains 18 back. 4km to go: Team Ineos reel in that Porte, Bardet and Kruijswijk attack at the top of the peloton, while the gap between Impey and Benoot and the chief chasers stands at 14 seconds. Benoot has been awarded the most aggressive rider accolade for today. 6km to go: Home hero Bardet leads a break at the front of the peloton, with Richie Porte behind him. Impey and Benoot jostle at the front for the lead. And the main pursuers are now 20 seconds behind. 8km to go: Benoot makes a move, Impey responds but Roche cannot and loses some serious ground. He hangs on in there. Meanwhile, Ineos hit the front of the peloton, as the GC contenders begin to set out their stalls. 12km to go: Tratnik joins those losing the wheel and losing ground, as Impey joins the front two, applying real pressure on Roche and Benoot, and then hitting the front, taking the KOTM points at the summit. The peloton are 14 minutes behind, but starting to up the pace. 14km to go: Benoot catches Postlberger, who\u2019s going backwards now as the climb gets more arduous, and then Roche hits the front with Benoot in hot pursuit. Soler has started to struggle. It\u2019s livening up properly. 15km to go: They hit the ascent of the Cote de Saint-Just as Clarke, Herrada and Garcia Cortina try to join the gang of seven behind P\u00f6stlberger, who will surely be overhauled with his advantage down to 11 seconds. Alaphilippe\u2019s GC lead is not really in danger by the way - it\u2019d need Roche to be more than 23 minutes ahead of him in the leading group. 19km to go: As we head nearer to Brioude, the breakaway fragments a little yet again, as Boasson Hagen makes a move to join the leading group of chasers behind P\u00f6stlberger. Soler, Benoot, Stuyven and Roche are prominent in that group. And as the last climb approaches, it looks as if P\u00f6stlberger is being reeled in (or saving his energy). His lead is now a mere 24 seconds. The list of those seven chasers: Benoot, Tratnik, Naesen, Stuyven, Soler, Impey and Roche. Impey is at their head. 24km to go: P\u00f6stlberger just beginning to flag a little, the gap on his pursuers, which had crept over a minute, is now reeled back to around the 45sec mark. Soler looking keen among the chasing pack, and Boasson Hagen begins to step up. 31km to go: A bit of intrigue in the peloton. The Quick-Steppers had been comfortably in control at the head of it, protecting their man in yellow, Alaphilippe, but it\u2019s a bit more congested in there now. The gap from peloton to breakaway is more than 11 minutes. Meanwhile, P\u00f6stlberger\u2019s advantage is now 34 seconds, with no one yet showing an inclination to attack and challenge him. 35km to go: P\u00f6stlberger is really motoring at the moment, and has stretched his advantage to more than 20 seconds. You don\u2019t imagine it\u2019ll stay like that but it\u2019s giving the other frontrunners something to think about. 42km to go: And from that breakaway group of six P\u00f6stlberger suddenly hits the front, with clear daylight to his pursuers. 44km to go: Garcia Cortina attacks, Stuyvem goes with him and Benoot joins the party and gets to the front. Who will respond now? And how? Boasson Hagen struggling at the back of the leading group 50km to go: Tests of stamina will begin to kick in soon, and we might reasonably expect some movement and shaking out with 40km to go. For now, as they ride downhill towards La Prieure Sainte-Croix, the leading group extend their advantage over the peloton to 10mins 45sec. 55 km to go: The breakaway bunch are back together again after Simon Clarke and Jan Tratnik led that mini-attack a few kilometres back. A spot of shadow-boxing there, to size things up for the sprint finish. Alaphilippe being shepherded by his team-mates at the head of the peloton. Daryl Impey comes first at C\u00f4te Des Guillaumanches, pipping Ties Benoot. That\u2019s the South African\u2019s first King of the Mountains points. Two for him, one for Benoot. 61km to go: Clarke and Tratnick attack, just stretching out the leading group, with a sub-group of five now out at the front. Soler is among them, with Tony Martin just at his wheel. 63km to go: There\u2019s talk of a growing headwind towards the end of today\u2019s course, which could affect how things shake up in the final stages, as the leading bunch hit the top of the C\u00f4te Des Guillaumanches. Roche remains at the front of the group, followed by Herrada and Soler. For all the Bardet boosterism at the roadside, he\u2019s nowhere in this race. Alaphilippe, in yellow, still sits at the front of the peloton, which is 10mins 14sec behind the breakaway group. 67km to go: This is currently just a pleasant Sunday afternoon bike ride for all concerned, a calm before the storm, through country roads adorned with Romain Bardet graffiti. A convivial Bastille Day being enjoyed by all. The gap from leaders to peloton creeps back over 10 minutes. 71km to go: Quickstep happy enough to defend their man\u2019s yellow jersey today at the front of the peloton, as the gap with the leaders dips below 10 minutes for the first time in a while. That leading group gearing themselves up for the Cote Des Guillaumanches climb, which isn\u2019t as severe as their earlier slog at the Mur d\u2019Aurec-sur-Loitre but will present its own challenges. That intermediate sprint result in full: 1. Boasson Hagen, 2. Stuyven, 3. Delaplace, 4. Impey, 5. Benoot, 6. Herrada, 7. Roche, 8. Clarke, 9. P\u00f6stlberger, 10. Naesen, 11. T. Martin, 12. Tratnik, 13. Garcia Cortina, 14. Sicard, 15. Soler. Edvald Boasson Hagen wins the intermediate sprint! The Norwegian crosses the line ahead of Stuyven, Delaplace, Impey and Benoot. Anyway, thanks to John for stepping in, Tom here back in the saddle, with the leading pack still 10 minutes or so ahead of the peloton. 77 km to go: French hopes rest with this man. Can he be a contender for a GC? Next week will tell us more, though. He won\u2019t be winning today, that seems certain. The last Frenchman to win on Bastille Day while wearing yellow was Raymond Delisle in 1969. Eventual winner that year? Eddy Merckx, the greatest of all, and, of course, Belgian. 82 km to go: A reminder of today\u2019s breakaway group. Benoot (Lotto-Soudal) Boasson Hagen (Dimension Data), Clarke (EF Education First), Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Garcia (Bahrain-Merida), Herrada (Cofidis Solutions Credits), Impey (Mitchelton-Scott), Martin (Jumbo-Visma) OliverNaesen (Ag2r-La Mondiale), Postlberger (Bora-Hansgrohe), Roche (Sunweb), Sicard (Total-Direct Energie), Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo), Tratnik (Bahrain-Merida). Two Frenchmen in there in Anthony Delaplace and Romain Sicard. Neither have won a stage in the Tour, though Delaplace won a \u2018combativity\u2019 award in the first stage of the 2016 renewal. The winner that day was Mark Cavenidish. *sobs* 90 km to go: It\u2019s Bastille Day and France are hoping for a French winner of today\u2019s stage and this year\u2019s Tour - with Thibaut Pinot as best hope - as their last winner was this man, way back in 1985. 93 km to go: It looks like the break will contain today\u2019s winner. The best-placed rider on GC is Nicolas Roche, who was at least born in France, but is an Irishman, and from one of the sport\u2019s royal families. He\u2019s also 35, so might not be too suited to a sprint finish. This is his ninth Tour, whereas father Stephen rode it ten times, winning in 1987. He is 20 minutes down on Julian Alaphilippe, so no threat to the favourites. 97.5 km to go: Has this Tour had too many stages which peter into nothingness? Compared to other first weeks, where there pile-ups and rucks, it feels somewhat leisurely, and aside from Saturday and that excellent stage from Mulhouse to la Planche des Belles Filles, something of a procession. The fun really starts on Wednesday in Toulouse, and the Pyrenees, with the stage finishing at Bagn\u00e8res-de-Bigorre. 100km to go: Rui Costa, the peloton\u2019s Mr Unpopular, is back with the pack as that group of breakaway riders continue to pull away from him. Merci, Tom et bonjour \u00e0 tous. While Tom ingests his gels and baguettes, I shall be your guide. You can contact me on john.brewin.casual@theguardian.com and @johnbrewin_in the meantime. 105km to go: The 15-strong breakaway group are heading towards the delightfully named Craponne-sur-Arzon, and they\u2019re all just biding their time at the moment with the gap to the peloton remaining relatively stable at just over 10 minutes. On which note I\u2019m going to pull over to the side of the road, spread out my picnic rug, and tuck into a lovingly-prepared and lavish picnic (trans: popping down to the canteen in grey, overcast London). John Brewin will escort you through the next half-hour or so. 115km to go: The gap continues to grow, with the leaders - fronted by Roche and the Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step riders \u2013 now more than 10 and a half minutes ahead of the peloton as the route flattens out somewhat. \u201cThe Tour may be playing a bit of second fiddle to cricket, tennis and F1 today,\u201d admits Guy Hornsby, \u201cbut it\u2019s been great so far. The preponderance of beige flat stages are a thing of the past, and yesterday showed that in spades. It\u2019s great to see G fighting hard in a really open race.\u201d I do have to confess to occasionally breaking off from the cycling to yelp in anguish and hope at the cricket, but yes, this is an intriguingly open tour, and agreeably hard to call. 119km to go: Commentary chat, from Juan Antonio Flecha on Eurosport, attributing Rui Costa\u2019s travails, and the breakaway\u2019s unwillingness to let him join them, to his generally uncooperative nature. Thems the breaks. So he\u2019s in limbo, 2mins 46sec behind the leaders, with the peloton \u2013 headed by Alaphilippe, Ciccone and Pinot \u2013 ten minutes behind the front runners. 126km to go: It\u2019s all gone a bit pear-shaped for Rui Costa, who looks to have lost touch with the leaders and is close to abandoning the chase. He\u2019s in a bit of a huff with the attentions given to him by his attendant camera crew, and is now around a minute off the leaders. Roche heads the 15-strong leading group. 130km to go: A king of the mountains win for Benoot! The Belgian is first over the summit, delivering another victory to Lotto-Soudal. Here\u2019s the points from the Mur d\u2019Aurec-sur-Loire (cateory 1, km 36.5): 1. Tiejs Benoot, 10 pts 2. Anthony Delaplace, 8 pts 3. Daryl Impey, 6 pts 4. Romain Sicard, 4 pts 5. Jesus Herrada, 2 pts 6. Nicolas Roche, 1 pt 133km to go: Marc Soler has joined the leading group, which is a hell of an effort on this narrow, vertiginous climb on a road absolutely thronged with encroaching spectators, who are taxing the security people somewhat, albeit that it\u2019s all very festive and good-natured. Rui Costa is only 45 seconds behind the pack too. The breakaway is now seven minutes ahead of the peloton, headed by yellow-jersey holder Alaphilippe, with Pinot and Thomas just behind them. 135km to go: There\u2019s no sign the leading bunch are inclined to let Soler and Rui Costa join them, as we approach the big climb on the Mur. The gap between the leaders and the peloton has grown to six minutes, but as we hit the Mur we\u2019ll learn a lot more. Soler\u2019s making a decent fist of joining them, he\u2019s 46 seconds behind the leading group, who are in energy-preserving mode, as well they should, as the gradient grows and the road narrows. News on Alessandro De Marchi, who crashed horribly earlier and had to quit the race. And it\u2019s more encouraging \u2013 he wanted to continue, he was conscious, but he\u2019s got a cut on his eyebrows and needs his collar bone examined. His injuries are nowhere near as serious as they looked they might be when he clattered into the kerb. He\u2019s on his way to hospital for x-rays. 136.5km to go: The odd \u201cAllez Bardet\u201d banner beginning to appear, as the Frenchman rides through home territory. He\u2019s back in the pack, with the peloton just over three minutes behind the leaders as it passes over the Loire. And here\u2019s that leading bunch in full: Benoot (Lotto-Soudal) Boasson Hagen (Dimension Data), Clarke(EF Education First), Delaplace (Arkea-Samsic), Garcia (Bahrain-Merida), Herrada (Cofidis Solutions Credits), Impey (Mitchelton-Scott), Martin (Jumbo-Visma) OliverNaesen (Ag2r-La Mondiale), Postlberger (Bora-Hansgrohe), Roche (Sunweb), Sicard (Total-Direct Energie), Stuyven (Trek-Segafredo), Tratnik (Bahrain-Merida). Soler and Rui Costa continue to plough their lonely, slightly futile-looking furrows as chasers. 143km to go: We\u2019re climbing now, through really beautiful countryside it must be said, and we now have an established and strong break of 14, headed by Nico Roche and followed by Herrada and Stuyven. Benoot, Boassen Hagen, Naesen and Martin are among them. In no-man\u2019s land around 50 seconds behind them is Marc Soler, with Rui Costa on his own a minute and 40-odd seconds further back. Alaphilippe heads the peloton, which is around two and a half minutes behind the front. 153km to go: It looks as if the big break will be made on the Mur itself, which is looming large now. There\u2019s a group of about 15 at the front, including Roche, Naesen, Impey, Garcia Cortina, Herrada, Clarke, Martin, Stuyven and Benoot. Marc Soler has broken clear in a bid to join them. 158km to go: Tim Wellens, Wout van Aert and Rui Costa have joined Politt out front, with others looking to join the breakaway behind them. It\u2019s been a pretty aggressive start 159km to go: Alessandro De Marchi has had a nasty looking crash back in the pack, and looks to have hurt his head on the kerb. He\u2019s receiving medical assistance, and has had to be taken away in an ambulance. His race is over. 163km to go: Politt\u2019s powering ahead at the moment. He\u2019ll want and expect some company soon. Total Direct Energy have packed out the front of the peloton. De Gendt, yesterday\u2019s winner, riding cautiously thus far. 167km to go. Tim Wellens has gone off on his own, Billy no-mates, to set an early pace. Nils Politt is next to break clear. They\u2019re going at around 75km per hour 170km to go: Off they go, downhill, amid a volley of early Bastille-day fireworks. A fast-looking start, with those keen to get in the early breakaway already going hard. Some predictions: Today\u2019s stage heads downhill for the first 10km, which promises us a fast start, followed by 7km up, 7km down again before we begin the arduous Mur d\u2019Aurec-sur-Loire climb. They\u2019re about 4.3km from the line, which is also a downhill run. They\u2019re getting ready to ride out from Saint-\u00c9tienne, which is bathed in glorious/gruelling sunshine \u201cWhat a day for Pinot it was yesterday!\u201d trills MaliciousA on the Twitters. \u201cReaching into the bag and pulling a Stomp On, he thrilled with his heroics. Today is going to be great as he continues to consolidate his position.\u201d Yep, his performance has certainly spiced things up. Some Frenchman-in-yellow facts: Alaphilippe is the 32nd Frenchman to be wearing yellow at the start of the race on Bastille Day. The last two to lead on 14 July were Tony Gallopin in 2014 and Thomas Voeckler three years earlier, though the former only had it for one day. Some pre-racing reading for your delectation. Here\u2019s William Fotheringham on French hopes: When the tide runs his way, Pinot looks more than strong enough, as he did at the end of last year when he won two stages in the Tour of Spain and the Giro di Lombardia. So far in this Tour it has all gone his way. While Bardet\u2019s AG2R squad flopped, the Groupama-FDJ team performed above expectations in the first Sunday\u2019s team time trial, putting him on the front foot immediately, and this was followed by a strong showing behind the victorious Alaphilippe in \u00c9pernay, where he gained five seconds on Thomas. Slender pickings, but it gave him an advantage. His young, talented climbing teammate David Gaudu is also in sparkling form. The full piece is here. And here\u2019s yesterday\u2019s stage eight report from Jeremy Whittle: General classification \u2013 how they stand: And here\u2019s the points situation And the teams Stage nine, Saint-\u00c9tienne to Brioude, 170.5km Morning everyone, and happy Bastille Day. These are hopeful times for French fans, with one of theirs in yellow, Julian Alaphilippe, and another, Thibaut Pinot, riding himself into serious contention for the overall crown. Could 34 years of hurt be ending this time? (And will we ever stop describing any sporting title-drought as \u201cxx years of hurt?\u201d). Whatever, this Tour is showing signs of heating up after a meandering first week, with Geraint Thomas\u2019s tenacious display in yesterday\u2019s stage from M\u00e2con to Saint-\u00c9tienne raising hopes that last year\u2019s champion might retain his title. Thomas\u2019s position might have been even stronger had he not been caught up in the crash between Michael Woods and Gianni Moscon, from which he recovered strongly but still lost 39 seconds to Alaphilippe and 28 to Pinot. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t crashed I could have followed [Pinot and Alaplilippe] and it\u2019s a totally different story then,\u201d Thomas told ITV afterwards. \u201cThibaut Pinot and Julian Alaphillipe have a good kick and punch - they are the guys to watch and beat.\u201d Today\u2019s stage, a hilly one, features an imposing early climb in the shape of the Mur d\u2019Aurec-sur-Loire, from which we should see the stage\u2019s first breakaway and ends with a 30km loop around Brioude (Romain Bardet\u2019s hometown of course) that should be tailor-made for a bunch sprint of those who\u2019ve stayed the pace. The ever-formidable Peter Sagan, the current points leader, will, one suspects, be looking forward to this in particular. Today\u2019s stage starts at 12.25pm BST. And since we\u2019re starting in Saint-\u00c9tienne, here\u2019s some gratuitous, and possibly appropriate, pre-stage music: Tom will be here shortly to take you through stage nine.",

      "bodyText": "A Texas detention center which Vice-President Mike Pence visited on Friday, seeing migrants packed into cages amid what one reporter called an \u201coverwhelming\u201d stench, was in fact \u201cclean but crowded\u201d, Donald Trump claimed on Sunday morning. That contradicted a statement issued by Pence\u2019s office on Friday, which said it had \u201cspecifically instructed [Customs and Border Protection] to not clean up or sanitize the facility beyond what is routine so the American people could see how serious the crisis at our border is\u201d. US authorities at the southern border are struggling to cope with an influx of migrants from Central America, in what most agree is a spiralling humanitarian crisis. Press reports and official accounts have shown migrants of all ages held in spartan and squalid conditions. The Trump administration blames Democrats in Congress. Democrats accuse the administration of willfully making the problem worse. Some have likened the holding centers to concentration camps, a particularly emotive suggestion. On Sunday Trump ally Lindsey Graham, one of a group of Republican senators who accompanied Pence to Texas, told Fox Business Network\u2019s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo: \u201cThis is not a concentration camp that I saw, it is a facility overwhelmed.\u201d The South Carolina senator also said: \u201cI don\u2019t care if they have to stay in these facilities for 400 days. We\u2019re not going to let those men go that I saw. It would be dangerous. \u201cAll of them broke our law. Many of them have done it before. And we\u2019re not going to let them go.\u201d Before playing golf near Washington on Sunday, the president followed incendiary remarks about progressive Democratic women with a two-tweet volley about Pence\u2019s visit to centers in Donna and McAllen. Referring to the first visit in which Pence and eight senators saw a facility which held children and mothers, Trump wrote: \u201cFriday\u2019s tour showed vividly, to politicians and the media, how well run and clean the children\u2019s detention centers are. Great reviews!\u201d After taking a familiar shot at reporting by the New York Times, he said \u201cthe adult single men areas were clean but crowded\u201d and said without offering evidence such areas were \u201calso loaded up with a big percentage of criminals\u201d. \u201cSorry, can\u2019t let them into our country. If too crowded, tell them not to come to USA, and tell the Dems to fix [immigration law] loopholes \u2013 Problem Solved!\u201d Pence\u2019s visit to McAllen became the eye of an online storm. The press pool was swiftly removed from the room containing the caged men but Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post tweeted his impressions and pictures. He wrote: \u201cVP saw 384 men sleeping inside fences, on concrete w[ith] no pillows or mats. They said they hadn\u2019t showered in weeks, wanted toothbrushes, food. Stench was overwhelming. [Customs and Border Protection] said they were fed regularly, could brush daily [and] recently got access to shower (many hadn\u2019t for 10-20 days).\u201d Dawsey contested official descriptions of conditions and how long the men had been there and wrote that the \u201cheat was sweltering\u201d though \u201cCBP said it was air conditioned\u201d. The cages were so crowded it was impossible for all the men to lie on the concrete floor, he said. Dawsey said Pence\u2019s office said the vice-president \u201cwanted press to see the McAllen facility but that secret service had concerns about him going inside\u201d. At a news conference, Pence said: \u201cLook, this is tough stuff.\u201d He also said: \u201cI knew we\u2019d see a system that is overcrowded. It\u2019s overwhelmed and that\u2019s why Congress has to act.\u201d On Sunday Ken Cuccinelli, acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, told ABC\u2019s This Week: \u201cCongress has let it happen. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d He rejected the suggestion the migrants\u2019 human rights were being violated and said overcrowding was \u201ca reality of facilities not designed to handle the swamping at the border\u201d. To the contention that \u201ceven the most hardened criminals in our criminal justice system are not treated like that, death row inmates don\u2019t live in conditions like that\u201d, Cuccinelli said: \u201cWell that\u2019s because we have a much slower flow of people coming into our prisons.\u201d On Sunday, Dawsey responded to Trump\u2019s tweets. \u201cThe men,\u201d he wrote, \u201ccrammed inside fences, were sleeping on concrete and said they hadn\u2019t showered in many days. It was sweltering hot and the stench was horrific.\u201d",

Out came the safety car, and in came Hamilton for his one and only stop. </p> <p>Bottas had already pitted, and with the field driving slowly, Hamilton was able to nip in for fresh tyres to retain his lead.

      "bodyText": "And with that, I\u2019m on my bike. Here, once again, is Giles Richards\u2019 report on Lewis Hamilton\u2019s record-breaking sixth British GP win. Bye! And here\u2019s Lewis Hamilton: If I\u2019m honest, coming here I didn\u2019t know how many [British GPs] I\u2019d won. I still remember my first win here, my first pole here. Every year is such a challenge. This track is amazing, I can\u2019t put into words just how spectacular this track is to drive. To be amongst the greats that have shined on this circuit, I\u2019m so incredibly proud to be a part of it. [On his final lap, the fastest of the race] I was going for it. I saved just enough I think to have something left at the end. It was close, but the lap was looking really good. I really wanted that as well. Yesterday, what\u2019s crazy is that, second is great, third is great, but first is something unique. When you\u2019re striving for perfection and you don\u2019t reach it, you can still be proud of yourself but I\u2019m hard on myself. I was a little bit frustrated yesterday. I wanted to come here today and do something powerful. I wanted to harness the fans\u2019 energy. I feel like I captivated that energy that they had and used it. Here\u2019s Max Verstappen, initially on his battles with Leclerc: They were very hard and aggressive, so that was good. I didn\u2019t want to risk too much with divebombing or whatever. The race was long and we were clearly faster. But it was good to see and good to be in it. Out of the pits I locked up a bit, had no grip. So he went by again. Then I got round the outside of Seb but got rear-ended. He could see I was going to close the door on the inside, so a bit different to Baku. I think he could expect me to close the door. We already spoke to each other, he apologised. At the end of the day what can you do. I don\u2019t know how I brought that car to the finish. The power steering failed, my seat was out. When I jumped out of the car the whole floor and the rear was destroyed. I\u2019m so happy to finish fifth. Jenson Button calls it \u201cone of the best British grands prix I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d. That\u2019s a reflection on the battles between Red Bull and Ferrari, with Leclerc and Verstappen having a particularly great duel, rather than anything that happened at the head of the race, though for the first 20 laps Hamilton and Bottas were also putting on a show. Giles Richards has filed his report from Silverstone: Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix, taking the victory after an initial dogged fight with his Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas fell in his favour, during a safety car period. Once in the lead he ran a controlled race from the front to ensure a record sixth win at Silverstone. Bottas was second, in front of the Ferrari of Charles Leclerc who had enjoyed an almost race-long scrap with the Red Bulls of Max Verstappen who was fifth and Pierre Gasly who was fourth. Sebastian Vettel also vied with Verstappen but came off badly. He hit the Dutchman and was given a penalty, finishing in 16th place. Much more here: Finishing the race with the fastest lap, on old, hard tyres, was a big statement from Hamilton. He might been a bit lucky to sneak past Bottas while the safety car was out, but that was champion racing. The latest driver standings are as follows: 1. Hamilton/Mercedes, 223 points 2. Bottas/Mercedes, 184 3. Verstappen/Red Bull, 136 4. Vettel/Ferrari, 123 5. Leclerc/Ferrari, 120 6. Gasly/Red Bull, 55 7. Sainz/McLaren, 38 8. Raikkonen/Alfa Romeo 25 9. Norris/McLaren 22 10. Ricciardo/Renault 22 The top three drivers are on the podium and enjoying their anthems. Here\u2019s the Press Association\u2019s on-the-flag hot take: Lewis Hamilton won the British Grand Prix for a record sixth time. The Formula One world champion took advantage of a safety car to jump ahead of Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, delighting the bumper 141,000-strong Silverstone crowd. The win, Hamilton\u2019s seventh from 10 rounds, takes the Briton ever closer to a sixth world title. He is now 39 points clear of Bottas in the championship standings. On a sensational day for Hamilton, the Englishman also secured a bonus point by posting a stunning track record on his final lap. Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc finished third after Sebastian Vettel crashed into the back of Max Verstappen. Red Bull driver Verstappen managed to finish fifth, but Vettel dropped to 16th with the damage sustained in the incident. The Ferrari driver was also hit with a 10-second penalty for causing the collision. Lando Norris crossed the line a disappointing 11th on his maiden home event, the British teenager\u2019s race scuppered by strategy. For Hamilton, his stroke of luck arrived on lap 20 of the 52-lap race when Antonio Giovinazzi beached his Alfa Romeo at Brooklands. Out came the safety car, and in came Hamilton for his one and only stop. Bottas had already pitted, and with the field driving slowly, Hamilton was able to nip in for fresh tyres to retain his lead. The Englishman crossed the line 25 seconds clear of Bottas, surpassing Britain\u2019s double world champion Jim Clark and the Frenchman Alain Prost as the standalone master of his home race. \u201cWhat a day, I love you Silverstone,\u201d said Hamilton on his warm-down lap. Charles Leclerc, who had a fabulous ding-dong with Max Verstappen, is happy: It\u2019s probably the race I enjoyed the most in my Formula One career. With the safety car we lost a bit of position, it wasn\u2019t great for us. I\u2019m extremely happy to finish third and for the battle we had on the track. The last race was an eye-opener for me, really showing how far we could go. I\u2019m really happy that this race has gone like this. Valtteri Bottas says this: I don\u2019t know what to say. I stopped first, and I was still effectively winning the race until there was a safety car, and Lewis got a free stop there and got me there. Not really my day, but at least the pace was good and it felt good out there. For sure there\u2019s positives. We had a good fight. I\u2019ll keep fighting. It\u2019s not over yet. Lewis Hamilton has a chat: Honestly, I can\u2019t terll you how proud I ame to be here today in front of my home crowd, with my whole family here today, my team. You\u2019d think you would get used to something like that, but it feels like the first time and I\u2019m forever grateful to everyone who\u2019s come out. I couldn\u2019t have done it without my team, and the guys back at the factory, and their wives and their kids who support them. When I tell people thankyou to the team, there\u2019s nearly 2,000 people who make this possible. I\u2019m just a chink in that chain, and I\u2019m super proud to be a part of this. Confirmation of the final classification: Hamilton stops on the track, while a Martial brings him a Union flag to wave. This is his sixth British GP, after previous wins in 2008, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, a remarkable record. He thus overtakes Jim Clark and Alain Prost, who both had five wins, and now has the greatest record of all in this race. The final top 10: 1. Lewis Hamilton 2. Valtteri Bottas (+24.928) 3. Charles Leclerc 4. Pierre Gasly 5. Max Verstappen 6. Carlos Sainz 7. Daniel Ricciardo 8. Kimi Raikkonen 9. Daniil Kvyat 10. Nico Hulkenberg Lap 52 of 52: Hamilton sets a new fastest lap with his final effort, and he\u2019s won the British GP yet again! Lap 52 of 52: Hamilton is in his last lap, with space in front and behind. There\u2019s nothing to stop him now. Lap 50 of 52: Sainz v Ricciardo is the red-hot battle for sixth. There\u2019s but fractions of a second between them, but the five places ahead of them look sewn up. Lap 48 of 52: The Mercedes engineers are back out, in case Hamilton decides on a tyre change. Bottas, with his fresh soft tyres, is the fastest car on the track and has just set a new fastest lap. The update is that Bottas reported some tyre trouble, so Hamilton was told to stay out, so no orders were ignored. Lap 47 of 52: Bottas re-emerges, and he\u2019s 22.98 seconds behind Hamilton with just five laps to go! Lap 46 of 52: Now there is action in the Mercedes pits. Bottas comes in for his second change, and Hamilton is told to stay out for the remainder of the race. Lap 45 of 52: Hamilton is called into the pits, but he ignores the request and flies past. Lap 44 of 52: Nico Hulkenberg slips down to 11th, after Daniil Kvyat streaks past him. Lap 43 of 52: Vettel has received a 10-second penalty for causing the collision with Max Verstappen. Lap 42 of 52: Hamilton has 10 laps to go, and looks comfortable, particularly with Bottas likely to pit again. Lap 41 of 52: The floor of Verstappen\u2019s car has been damaged, but nothing that can be changed needs to be changed. Lap 40 of 52: The upshot of all that is that Leclerc is third, about 18 seconds behind Bottas in second. Gasly is fourth, with Verstappen fifth. Vettel has dropped down to 17th, with a potential penalty to come. Lap 39 of 52: Both Verstappen and Vettel are back on the track, but the latter at least has sustained significant damage. The Ferrari pits, and gets a new front wing. Verstappen is carrying on. Lap 38 of 52: Crash! Verstappen overtakes Vettel\u2019s Ferrari, who then drives right into the back of Verstappen\u2019s Red Bull! Both skid off the track! Lap 37 of 52: So Leclerc is fifth, but nearly five seconds behind Verstappen in fourth. There is a 12-second gap between Gasly in sixth and Carlos Sainz in seventh. Lap 36 of 52: Leclerc sweeps past Gasly, lovely driving! Gasly tries to get back ahead round Brooklands, but no dice! Lap 35 of 52: Further back, Albon, Raikkonen and Hulkenberg are separated by 1.1 seconds, with Albon clinging on to 10th place at the moment. Lap 33 of 52: It\u2019s unfortunate that the lead has changed hands without any actual overtaking happening. So far it\u2019s been a race of strategy and opportunism. Hamilton is currently a bit over two seconds ahead of Bottas, with Vettel a further eight seconds behind. Lap 30 of 52: Lando Norris gets on the radio, to complain of being \u201cscrewed over by the strategy\u201d. He will have to pit again, and is in eighth at the moment. Lap 28 of 52: Bottas will need to return to the pits at some point, while ahead of him Hamilton will hope to stay out for the remainder. Lap 27 of 52: Yellow flags are being waved at Brooklands, though we haven\u2019t been told why. Lap 25 of 52: Approaching the halfway stage, the current front six: 1. Hamilton 2. Bottas 3. Vettel 4. Gasly 5. Verstappen 6. Leclerc Lap 24 of 52: That was nearly ghastly for Gasly, who locks up and his Red Bull team-mate, Max Verstappen, nearly drives into the back of him! Lap 24 of 52: The safety car goes in, and the impact of the various pit-lane shenanigans while it was involved is that Lewis Hamilton leads the race! Lap 23 of 52: Leclerc gets on the radio to ask \u201chow the hell did we lose the position\u201d. He\u2019s told to concentrate on the race. He\u2019s currently sixth, with the safety car still out. Lap 22 of 52: Giovinazzi\u2019s mistake at the Vale, and the subsequent deployment of the safety car, might allow Hamilton to move to a one-stop strategy and thereby give him a crucial advantage over Bottas. Lap 21 of 52: Vettel also comes in, and like Hamilton has hard tyres fitted. Verstappen pits for the second time, and leaves with the same, fresh tyres. Lap 20 of 52: Antonio Giovinazzi is stuck in a gravel trap, and the safety car is deployed. Hamilton takes the opportunity to pop into the pits. Lap 19 of 52: Verstappen v Leclerc is the battle of the moment. Verstappen has a go at Stowe, where he is almost pushed onto the grass as Leclerc dives in front of him. Lap 18 of 52: Lando Norris and Alexander Albon have had some kind of off-camera pit-lane something-or-other. An investigation has been launched, we\u2019re told. Lap 17 of 52: Valtteri Bottas comes in for a fresh set of mediums. Two-stop strategies seem the order of the day. Lap 15 of 52: Leclerc overtakes almost instantly once they get out of the pits, after Verstappen drifted way wide \u2013 he gets on the radio to tell his mechanics that he had no grip. Lap 14 of 52: Leclerc and Verstappen both come into the pits! Both come out with fresh sets of medium compound tyres, and Verstappen comes out of the pit lane first! Lap 13 of 52: Pierre Gasly becomes the first of the leading group to pit. He comes out with a fresh set of hard tyres. Lap 11 of 52: Verstappen tries to overtake Leclerc, and when his move fails Vettel attacks him from behind, and from trying to third he\u2019s suddenly fighting off fifth! In the end, positions remain unchanged. Lap 10 of 57: The two Mercedes have stretched their lead a bit, and are about half a second ahead of Leclerc in third. Lap 8 of 57: Kevin Magnussen is back in the pits, and this time he won\u2019t be leaving them. That\u2019s his first retirement of the season. Lap 7 of 57: We see replays of the two Haas cars bumping each other in the opening lap, which was no the ideal start to proceedings. The top four remain in the order they started the race in. Behind them Sebastian Vettel has overtaken Pierre Gasly to take fifth. The race is at the front, where Hamilton is sniffing around Bottas. He looks one side, he looks the other. Then Hamilton takes the lead at Luffield! And then Bottas takes it back at Copse! A horrible start for Haas, with problems to both cars and Magnussen already lapped by the leaders. Romain Grosjean and Kevin Magnussen are forced into the pits in the very early stages, with rear punctures apparently to blame. Norris has overtaken Daniel Ricciardo to take seventh place. Before the race Norris said that him v Ricciardo was his mini-race. Go go go go go! Bottas holds on to his lead into the first corner, and it looks a clean start. The grid fills, and actual racing is about to happen. Hold on to your hats! The lights turn green, and off they go on the formation lap. Preambles complete, we are ready to race. Well, not us. We\u2019re ready to sit on our sofas. But some other people are. Pierre Gasly\u2019s car is also having some last-minute surgery. People in Red Bull overalls are sprinting around the pit lane. Max Verstappen\u2019s rear wing is being changed on the grid, with mechanics scurrying hither and yon, one of them pushing Sky\u2019s cameras away. \u201cHopefully I can put on a good show and go forwards, not backwards,\u201d Norris says, setting the bar high. \u201cWhat an embarrassment of sporting riches we have today,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby. \u201cThe race should be Lewis\u2019s providing he makes a fast start, but predictions make fools of us all. But it\u2019s hard not to be impressed by Lando Norris, not least because it\u2019s finally an improved year for McLaren.\u201d He is a really engaging character, and given a fair wind could be a star. The national anthem is warbled. The Red Arrows fly past. The clock ticks. Brilliantly chaotic scenes on the grid. Lee Mack is there. Philip Schofield has a quick chat. Two Spice Girls (scary and ginger, since you ask) are there. Daniel Craig is looking predictably suave. \u201cIt\u2019s my first time, I\u2019m just trying to take it all in,\u201d he says. Apparently it\u2019s the 1,007th grand prix, which is why he\u2019s been invited, and why Red Bull have a James Bond-themed paint job. Sky and Channel 4 do their grid walks. Both bump into Mo Farah at the same time, and interview him together. He\u2019s asked if he\u2019s spoken to Lewis Hamilton. \u201cHe was in that zone,\u201d he says. \u201cOnce someone\u2019s in that zone you just want to leave him there.\u201d On Sky, Lando Norris is interviewed while driving round Silverstone, an enterprise ruined both by the fact he is unable to talk and drive at the same time, and by the fact he gets the car stuck in a gravel trap. \u201cthat\u2019s the most embarrassing thing I think I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d he concludes. On Channel 4, Gareth Southgate is interviewing Toto Wolff. So far, they have repeatedly established their admiration for each other. They eventually move on to management techniques. \u201cMistakes happen everywhere, but you can only eliminate them if you discuss them,\u201d says Wolff. Southgate nods enthusiastically. Sky interview Steve Coogan, who \u201cwas invited down here by Lewis\u201d. They\u2019re unlikely chums, are they not? \u201cI\u2019m quite friendly with him,\u201d he adds. \u201cHe keeps threatening to make an appearance on Alan Partridge. Hopefully Lewis will do what he normally does.\u201d This is a good thing: The third of the three sporting crown jewels glittering their way across this English Sunday afternoon is at Silverstone, where Lewis Hamilton \u2013 winner of four of the last five grands prix this year, and four of the last five British grands prix to boot \u2013 starts second. Here\u2019s Giles Richards, setting the scene. Welcome!",

      "bodyText": "A healthy lifestyle that includes regular exercise, a balanced diet, not smoking and watching alcohol intake could reduce the risk of dementia \u2013 even in those with a genetic predisposition to such conditions, researchers say. Recent figures suggest there are 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK, and it is the leading cause of death for women in England. Many studies have indicated that lifestyle changes can reduce the risk of developing such conditions. A recent report suggested a third of cases could be prevented by tackling factors such as exercise, blood pressure, hearing and diet. In May, the World Health Organisation released guidelines on how to lead a brain-healthy lifestyle. However, it remained unclear whether such measures could have the same effect on those whose genes predispose them to dementia. Now experts say it seems they do. \u201cWe think there is a similar reduction in your risk of dementia associated with lifestyle, regardless of your genetic risk,\u201d said Prof David Llewellyn of Exeter University, who led the research. Llewellyn said the study also underscored that a high genetic risk or family history of dementia did not make it inevitable the condition would occur. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Llewellyn and colleagues report how they came to their conclusions by studying data, collected as part of a wider research endeavour called the UK Biobank, from almost 200,000 individuals of European ancestry aged 60 or older and who did not have dementia or cognitive problems at the outset. The team split participants into five equal groups based on their combination of almost 250,000 genetic variants linked to Alzheimer\u2019s disease in those of European ancestry. From this it produced three categories of low, intermediate and high genetic risk for dementia \u2013 the former and latter each comprising 20% of participants. The researchers also looked at participants\u2019 lifestyles, and the four key factors previously associated with a reduced dementia risk: meeting recommended guidelines for exercise, not smoking, eating from multiple food groups with little processed meat and lots of fruit and fish, and drinking one or fewer standard alcoholic drinks a day for women and two or fewer for men. Participants were given a score to reflect the overall \u201chealthiness\u201d of their lifestyle. The team tracked participants for about eight years, during which time 1,769 people \u2013 fewer than 1% of participants \u2013 developed some form of dementia. The results show that dementia prevalence was greater in the group with the highest genetic risk compared with the lowest: 1.2% and 0.6% respectively. A lower proportion of those with a healthy lifestyle developed dementia than those living unhealthily: 0.8% and 1.2%. Crucially, these trends appeared independently of each other. When the team took into account factors including age, sex and socioeconomic status, it found that a healthy lifestyle was linked to about a 30% lower risk of dementia compared with an unhealthy lifestyle, regardless of a high or low genetic predisposition. While the impact might seem small, the team said participants were at the younger end of older age, and that it would continue to follow the group to explore the link between lifestyle factors and dementia risk as people aged and more cases of dementia appeared. The study has limitations, including that lifestyle data was collected at one point in time and was self-reported, and it does not prove a healthier lifestyle is driving a lower risk of dementia. The study looked only at those of European ancestry, while some cases of dementia could have been missed. Prof Gill Livingston, an expert on dementia prevention at University College London who was not involved in the research, noted that the study looked at a small number of lifestyle factors and that participants had, in general, a healthier lifestyle than the general population. Nonetheless, she welcomed the study. \u201cThis is a very important paper, with a clear message that healthy lifestyle reduces dementia risk no matter what your genes are,\u201d she said.",

Stuart Collier, the journalist who was at the centre of the incident nearly 30 years ago, said Johnson was not fit to be prime minister. In 1990, Johnson was secretly recorded agreeing to provide the address of the News of the World reporter Stuart Collier to his friend Darius Guppy, who wanted to arrange for the journalist to have his ribs cracked as revenge for investigating his activities. In the event the assault did not occur, while Guppy ended up being jailed for a separate \u00a31.8m fraud and Johnson later dismissed the call as a joke.

      "bodyText": "It was a classic Boris Johnson dispatch from Brussels \u2013 funny, mocking and only partially based on fact. Under the headline \u201cItaly fails to measure up on condoms\u201d, Johnson revealed in the Daily Telegraph that \u201cBrussels bureaucrats have shown their legendary attention to detail by rejecting new specifications for condom dimensions\u201d, despite demands from the Italian rubber industry for a smaller minimum width. Readers were informed the decision had left \u201cItalian egos smarting\u201d, and he quoted an official spokesperson \u2013 Willy H\u00e9lin \u2013 who insisted \u201cthis is a very serious business\u201d. That was in 1991. Three decades later, H\u00e9lin, now retired, told the Guardian from his hospital bed he was still exasperated by the \u201cload of bullshit\u201d written by Johnson. \u201cWe were not interested by sizes. We had had requests from medical institutions across Europe to check on the safety of condoms. That has nothing to do with the size of dicks. All the journalists went on about comparing the size of penises in Germany and France. It\u2019s about safety, because so many doctors were interested to know about the risks for Aids patients,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was the paramount of exaggeration and distortion and lies. He was a clown \u2013 a successful clown.\u201d In the intervening years, Johnson\u2019s persona has elevated him to the highest stage. But according to those who knew him and worked with him in Brussels, the origins of his performance in those years were a crucial part of his political DNA. His five-year stint in the city as a reporter for the Daily Telegraph, they say, both shaped his politics and influenced the wider British Eurosceptic movement.

Johnson did not care for important but dull. Colleagues and adversaries say he did not invent the brand of Brussels-bashing British journalism that found niche pieces of European regulation and turned them into front-page stories about threats to the UK\u2019s sovereignty. But he seized on the approach, perfected it and become synonymous with it \u2013 helping sow many of the seeds that would later lead to Brexit and his potential rise to become prime minister. Having graduated from Oxford University and briefly considered becoming a management consultant, he secured a trainee job at the Times after making the (unrelated) journalist Frank Johnson laugh during a New Year\u2019s Eve party held at his fiancee Allegra Mostyn-Owen\u2019s family\u2019s stately home. Despite being sent for training on the Wolverhampton Express &amp; Star, he was sacked within months after fabricating quotes from his godfather Colin Lucas, a historian, in an attempt to get speculation about Edward II\u2019s supposed lover Piers Gaveston into a front-page news story. Having again used his contacts to secure a job at the Daily Telegraph, Johnson landed in Brussels, where he had spent a sometimes unhappy time as a child while his father, Stanley, served as one of the first British MEPs.

Charles Grant, who was working for the Economist in Brussels at the time, said: \u201cIt took him time to develop his persona.\u201d He said Johnson arrived as \u201ca fairly conventional\u201d journalist, but \u201cthe more he got on the front page, he had to live up to the character he had developed\u201d. His celebrity grew with stories about \u201cEC [European commission] plans\u201d to construct the world\u2019s tallest building for its headquarters or impose regulations on a reluctant Britain.

I think right now Warwick haven\u2019t proven their ability to do that.\u201d</p> <p>The woman, who had to sit one of her final-year exams alongside one of the men disciplined in the case, added: \u201cTheir track record would encourage me to say to people that maybe they\u2019re better to go elsewhere.

Danielle \u2013 not her real name \u2013 questioned the fitness of the university\u2019s vice-chancellor, Stuart Croft, to do his job because of his response to the complaint she and another female student brought last year after discovering they had been the subject of violent sexual comments exchanged among a group of male undergraduates. In an interview with the Guardian, she said: \u201cI think that if you are a girl or if you\u2019re a minority, if you\u2019ve been through past traumas, knowing that your university is going to care for you is really important. I think right now Warwick haven\u2019t proven their ability to do that.\u201d The woman, who had to sit one of her final-year exams alongside one of the men disciplined in the case, added: \u201cTheir track record would encourage me to say to people that maybe they\u2019re better to go elsewhere.

Her four-piece band, led by her partner and guitarist Ali G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc \u015eim\u015fek, are sporting dark glasses and dressed in black, priest-like robes, while Akyol comes on like an exotic butterfly, wearing boots and black shorts, with a bare midriff and transparent white wings attached to her wrists.</p> <p>The image may be pop but the music is anything but, veering from dark, brooding rock balladry, sometimes dressed up with twanging surf guitar, through to Turkish folk influences and tributes to her Turkish musical heroes.

Then there\u2019s the singalong Develerle Ya\u015f\u0131yorum (I\u2019m Living With Camels) and the angry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6nEDq6xN7s\">Nargile</a>, which includes the line: \u201cDig your grave deeper, your body is worthless.\u201d She says: \u201cThe police once questioned me about the lyrics and I said it was general, not specific.\u201d (A girl in the crowd tells me Akyol is \u201cthe most courageous artist in Turkey right now\u201d.)</p> <p>It\u2019s a musical fusion that, she says, reflects her upbringing. The daughter of the artist <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/artists/muzaffer-akyol/\">Muzaffer Akyol</a>, she\u2019s a social anthropology graduate and a painter (she sometimes exhibits her work alongside that of her father) who grew up surrounded by music. \u201cMy mum was a classical singer, while my dad listened to Turkish pop and jazz, and my uncle was a fan of Anatolian psychedelia and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2018/oct/09/how-the-west-was-won-inside-led-zeppelins-archive-in-pictures\">Led Zeppelin</a>.

The aim, she said, was to be \u201cauthentic and original. Music should reflect the pain and happiness of your culture.\u201d She regarded herself as a political artist, but used metaphors in her lyrics \u201cbecause if you use slogans, that doesn\u2019t affect people. You should find your own way of thinking and using language.\u201d And was this also a way of escaping the censors? \u201cThere may be a small percentage of fear in it. But it\u2019s about finding a unique artistic way of saying things.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Crazy guys are spreading around the world like cancer</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When asked to explain Constant Fantasy Is Reality, she answers: \u201cIt may sound cheesy, like new wave shit, but it\u2019s not escapism. It\u2019s going against escapism.

Festival director Harun Izer thinks the effect of the political climate on the city\u2019s musical scene has been \u201cpositive because political turmoil and argument help young people to be more creative\u201d. Akyol thinks of it rather differently. \u201cIf you put pressure on people, they\u2019ll find a way to express their feelings.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Gaye Su Akyol plays Jazz Cafe, London on 29 November, and EartH, London, on 30 November</p>",

Her four-piece band, led by her partner and guitarist Ali G\u00fc\u00e7l\u00fc \u015eim\u015fek, are sporting dark glasses and dressed in black, priest-like robes, while Akyol comes on like an exotic butterfly, wearing boots and black shorts, with a bare midriff and transparent white wings attached to her wrists. The image may be pop but the music is anything but, veering from dark, brooding rock balladry, sometimes dressed up with twanging surf guitar, through to Turkish folk influences and tributes to her Turkish musical heroes. There\u2019s a reference to the folk-rock singer Selda Ba\u011fcan, who was imprisoned in the 1980s, and songs by Erkin Koray, \u201cthe father of Turkish psychedelic rock\u201d, and by the late rock singer and TV host Bari\u015f Man\u00e7o. Her compositions include the opening \u0130stikrarli Hayal Hakikattir (Consistent Fantasy Is Reality), the title track of her latest album. Then there\u2019s the singalong Develerle Ya\u015f\u0131yorum (I\u2019m Living With Camels) and the angry Nargile, which includes the line: \u201cDig your grave deeper, your body is worthless.\u201d She says: \u201cThe police once questioned me about the lyrics and I said it was general, not specific.\u201d (A girl in the crowd tells me Akyol is \u201cthe most courageous artist in Turkey right now\u201d.) It\u2019s a musical fusion that, she says, reflects her upbringing. The daughter of the artist Muzaffer Akyol, she\u2019s a social anthropology graduate and a painter (she sometimes exhibits her work alongside that of her father) who grew up surrounded by music. \u201cMy mum was a classical singer, while my dad listened to Turkish pop and jazz, and my uncle was a fan of Anatolian psychedelia and Led Zeppelin. Then when I was 10 my brother played me Nirvana \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for at that age.\u201d So how important was it to keep a strong Turkish element in her songs? The aim, she said, was to be \u201cauthentic and original. Music should reflect the pain and happiness of your culture.\u201d She regarded herself as a political artist, but used metaphors in her lyrics \u201cbecause if you use slogans, that doesn\u2019t affect people. You should find your own way of thinking and using language.\u201d And was this also a way of escaping the censors? \u201cThere may be a small percentage of fear in it. But it\u2019s about finding a unique artistic way of saying things.\u201d When asked to explain Constant Fantasy Is Reality, she answers: \u201cIt may sound cheesy, like new wave shit, but it\u2019s not escapism. It\u2019s going against escapism. We should dream together to make war against the evil, the fascists, the crazy guys around the world who are spreading like cancer.\u201d Her concert was part of Vitrin, the Istanbul jazz festival showcase for contemporary Turkish music, which also included jazz-rock, folk and electronica. Festival director Harun Izer thinks the effect of the political climate on the city\u2019s musical scene has been \u201cpositive because political turmoil and argument help young people to be more creative\u201d. Akyol thinks of it rather differently. \u201cIf you put pressure on people, they\u2019ll find a way to express their feelings.\u201d \u2022 Gaye Su Akyol plays Jazz Cafe, London on 29 November, and EartH, London, on 30 November",

The former jetskiing champion and military reservist Franky Zapata clutched a rifle as he soared above the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on his futuristic machine, which the French military helped to develop. The board, which was first created to fly above water, can reach speeds of up to 190km/h and can run for 10 minutes. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, flanked by the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and other European leaders, nodded in approval and applauded the 40-year-old Zapata, who was referred to by astonished French TV commentators as \u201cJames Bond\u201d. The French armed forces minister, Florence Parly, said before the parade that the flyboard could \u201callow tests for different kinds of uses, for example as a flying logistical platform or, indeed, as an assault platform\u201d. Macron had invited Merkel and other leaders to the parade as part of his drive for deeper European defence cooperation. \u201cNever, since the end of the second world war, has Europe been so important,\u201d the French president said. But as Macron opened the parade by being driven down the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es in an open-topped military vehicle, waving to a flag-carrying crowd, a few gilets jaunes anti-government protesters, who had mingled with onlookers despite tight security, inflated yellow balloons and booed the president.

      "bodyText": "The government will set out plans to resuscitate the UK\u2019s struggling nuclear ambitions with a new scheme which would leave taxpayers liable for rising costs or delays. The funding model, expected this week, could help bankroll the multibillion pound plans for a follow-on to EDF Energy\u2019s Hinkley Point C project in Somerset, which ministers aim to build at the Sizewell site in Suffolk. It could also resurrect the dormant plans for a \u00a316bn new nuclear reactor at the Wylfa project in North Wales, which fell apart last year due to the high costs of nuclear construction. Government officials are expected to reveal a new financial framework based on the model being used to finance the \u00a34.2bn Thames Tideway tunnel. Under those plans, the government has allowed the super-sewer\u2019s developers to charge customers upfront for the project, and agreed to cover cost overruns above 30% of the budget and step in as a lender if funding dries up. The nuclear plans are expected to be unveiled before parliament\u2019s summer recess at the end of this week, before a long-awaited energy white paper. The policy roadmap will set out the government\u2019s plans for the energy sector as the economy moves towards the UK\u2019s target to reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. The industry is expected to have three months to respond to an official consultation before ministers decide whether to move ahead with the scheme. Senior nuclear industry sources have told government officials and investors that the proposed finance framework, known as a regulated asset base (RAB) model, could lead to lower costs for consumers. The plans would hand developers an upfront regulated return on their investment at each new phase of the project. This could encourage more investment from infrastructure and pension funds and better borrowing terms for the developer. Government officials are under pressure to find a new way to finance nuclear projects after the National Audit Office condemned the 35-year deal to support the Hinkley Point project through energy bills at a cost of \u00a392.50 for every megawatt-hour of electricity it produces. The average electricity price in the UK last year was between \u00a355 and \u00a365 per megawatt-hour. The watchdog accused ministers of putting energy bill payers on the hook for a \u201crisky and expensive\u201d project which offers \u201cuncertain strategic and economic benefits\u201d. The new financing plan has already raised concerns that applying the Tideway model to a nuclear project that costs \u00a320bn and takes around a decade to build could leave taxpayers exposed to a far higher financial risk. Nuclear projects have suffered high-profile delays and multibillion-pound cost overruns in recent years, making them almost impossible to finance without state intervention. EDF said last month that its struggling French nuclear project at Flamanville could be delayed by another three years to repair eight faulty weldings discovered at the site. The latest delay could push Flamanville\u2019s start date, originally in 2012, to 2022. The project was expected to cost about \u20ac3bn when construction began but the latest estimates put its cost at almost \u20ac11bn. EDF Energy has claimed the risk to taxpayers of funding its Sizewell B project would be far lower \u2013 almost by a fifth \u2013 because it is a copy of the same design for build Hinkley Point C. The Sizewell project could even be competitive with the cost of offshore wind, according to the firm, once the cost of backing up windfarms when the wind doesn\u2019t blow is taken into account. On a standalone basis, nuclear electricity would cost more than wind and solar power projects. \u2022This story was amended on 15 July 2019 to clarify the timing of the government\u2019s energy white paper in the sixth paragraph",

Not because the attack, largely carried out it seems by a man wielding a tripod, left anyone seriously hurt, but because such violence has spread to parts of the world where the freedom to report has for generations, been considered an inalienable right. During a two day Foreign Office-hosted conference, Lord Hall told of BBC staff being arrested or harassed around the world. A day later, a senior police officer in Britain\u2019s biggest police force threatened journalists with arrest for printing government leaks of the Kim Darroch memos, a state of affairs more common in authoritarian states such as Russia. Threats such as this from the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism chief, Neil Basu, thrive in a world in which the lack of faith in the media is allowed to increase. Many of the most dangerous countries, such as Saudi Arabia and Burundi, were not represented at the media freedom event in London. Abuses such as the murder of the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi helped make 2018 the worst year on record for violence and abuse against journalists, according to Reporters without Borders.

During the recent elections in India, the BBC saw an increase in viewers when it published reports calling out fake news stories; it also identified at least 25 lynch mob deaths after fake rumours spread on social media. But nothing should diminish the horror of physical attacks and even murder, which is increasing around the world. The Foreign Office deserves credit for hosting last week\u2019s conference and announcing a series of pledges to do more, but more concrete action would not go amiss. Co-host Canada has managed to impose sanctions on Saudi nationals allegedly linked to the murder of Khashoggi. Why won\u2019t the UK? Rebecca Vincent, UK director of RSF, pointed out that although Khashoggi was mentioned several times, there was no move to do anything about the 30 journalists campaign groups say are imprisoned in Saudi Arabia. We live in difficult, dangerous times in which a president can call the media the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and a protester in London can shout \u201chang the judge\u201d. We all know how the 1930s ended. As he heard his sentence last week, Robinson flashed a V for victory sign.",

His new home in Greenwich Village, New York, contains everything from an ancient Roman mosaic to 18th-century British portraits to Simpsons figurines to artworks by his beloved Leonard Cohen. But something is missing. Something vital.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re low on bird seed now,\u201d Newmark observes anxiously. \u201cThat\u2019s a crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The scale and scope of the crisis become evident when you understand Newmark\u2019s ornithological obsession. During an hour-long conversation, his eye keeps wandering to the small garden where mourning doves, house sparrows, cardinals, blue jays and \u201ca hopefully limited number of pigeons\u201d come and go. Just last night he installed a webcam so he can watch them all remotely. For good measure, there are numerous photos of birds on the walls and a papier-mache model, made by his 11-year-old nephew.</p> <p>\u201cI love birds for reasons unknown,\u201d Newmark says. \u201cWe\u2019re observing that the doves are not that nice to each other and we also see them fighting with the sparrows. The sparrows are much smaller, but the more aggressive sparrows can chase off a much larger dove. So I\u2019ve named them Cersei and Daenerys.\u201d</p> <p>It may be that Newmark feels more comfortable around feathered friends than the human variety. He is a self-declared \u201cnerd of the old school, 1950s style\u201d, squirrel watcher and sci-fi fan who, sitting in a jacket, trousers and slippers, cheerfully admits he is \u201csimulating\u201d social skills. He is a computer geek who checks email obsessively and in 1995 founded Craigslist \u2013 which is, <a href=\"https://www.craigslist.org/about/craig_newmark\" title=\"\">with about 50bn page views </a><a href=\"https://www.craigslist.org/about/craig_newmark\" title=\"\">a month,</a> one of the world\u2019s most popular websites. Now 66, he is a survivor of the age of internet idealism, before fake news and perpetual outrage cast long shadows.</p> <p>But he is also a divisive figure. Some express gratitude to Craigslist for life-changing opportunities to find a spouse or a job. Others condemn it for gutting the classified advertising market and accelerating the demise of local newspapers. This ambivalence was captured by a New York Times headline last October that described Newmark as a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/technology/craig-newmark-journalism-gifts.html\" title=\"\">\u201cnewspaper villain\u201d</a> and another last month that called him a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/business/media/consumer-reports-craig-newmark.html\" title=\"\">\u201cnew friend to journalism\u201d.</a> The latter referred to Newmark\u2019s latest act of philanthropy, a $6m (\u00a34.8m) gift to Consumer Reports \u2013 the biggest donation in the 83-year history of <a href=\"https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm\" title=\"\">the nonprofit watchdog</a> \u2013 that will be used to set up a digital division to scrutinise products and platforms, including social media.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m mostly concerned about the way social media platforms can be weaponised, that they sometimes forget to provide informed consent regarding the uses of your personal data,\u201d he explains. \u201cI do feel that any site should tell you what it would like to collect and what it would like to share with others and then ask your permission.\u201d</p> <p>The political consultancy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" title=\"\">Cambridge Analytica</a>, which harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users during the 2016 US presidential election, is one such example, he says. However, Newmark, who has met Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, but does not know him well, declines to criticise him or suggest Zuckerberg has created a monster.</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea what he\u2019s done personally. I focus on how we all work on this together. It\u2019s all hands on deck. People need to enlist much like in the US after the attack <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/pearl-harbor-attack-us-japan-1941-archive\" title=\"\">[on Pearl Harbor] in December of 1941,</a> much like people during the Battle of Britain. There are foreign adversaries who\u2019ve come out, published their public statements and say that they\u2019re at war with us.\u201d</p> <p>Victory is unlikely to be as clear as in the second world war, however. \u201cThe measure of success would be that I would be able to choose from a high number of publications wherein I know that I can trust everything they say with the occasional mistake, which they will then fix. Because news is hard; you\u2019re going to make mistakes, then you correct them and Bob\u2019s your uncle.\u201d</p> <p>Newmark, who has previously observed \u201ca trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy\u201d, prefers not to use the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 perhaps it has been tainted for ever by Donald Trump. He reasons: \u201cSome people have said fake news is news that I don\u2019t like, so I will talk about misinformation or disinformation and that is often either false news or false witness, either weaponised information or just carelessness.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bb84e2a0e3c666f87e4ece71cd2a094deed06d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb84e2a0e3c666f87e4ece71cd2a094deed06d17/0_0_12444_7467/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Craigslist ... classified information.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craigslist ... classified information.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Illustration: Guardian Design</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIf it\u2019s carelessness, you can tell someone: \u2018Hey, you got it wrong; here\u2019s the evidence.\u2019 If it\u2019s disinformation, they don\u2019t care, they will just publish it again. Meanwhile, when you point out the problem, they might decide that you\u2019re a target for harassment.\u201d</p> <p>There is an entire ecosystem at work, he continues, that can enable a falsehood from the obscure reaches of the web to jump on to millions of TV screens with dizzying speed. \u201cIt\u2019s a small amount of disinformation originating in some of the social media platforms used by foreign adversaries and their domestic allies. They get amplified: there\u2019s multiple levels including conspiracy sites, then news sites which don\u2019t care about fact-checking. And then once that becomes news, sometimes that emerges into conventional or mainstream media.\u201d</p> <p>How can it be stopped? \u201cPeople in mainstream media can just do things like fact-checking. They could avoid giving airtime or space to people they know routinely disinform and they can just avoid amplifying disinformation.\u201d The new journalism centres he is funding are considering whether journalistic ethics codes should explicitly say: \u201cDon\u2019t amplify disinformation.\u201d</p> <p>If this sounds like a swipe at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/12/fox-news-brain-meet-the-families-torn-apart-by-toxic-cable-news\" title=\"\">Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News</a>, Newmark ducks an invitation to be critical. He is similarly circumspect when asked if tech giants should be broken up, if the existence of billionaires is unethical (he is a mere millionaire) or whether the decline of local journalism contributed to the ascent of Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d is his default response.</p> <p>Speaking of the president, Newmark, who has donated to Democratic presidential hopefuls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/10/kamala-harris-2020-campaign-debate\" title=\"\">Kamala Harris</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/elizabeth-warren-2020-campaign-selfies-town-halls\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Warren</a>, gives an unorthodox answer when asked what he thinks of his term in office so far. \u201cHe\u2019s been very effective in terms of getting elected.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI am very passionate about understatement. I know the British practise that. I learned little by little. For example, I spent some time in Edinburgh last year and I now really like haggis. I\u2019ve also acquired a taste for Scotch whisky. I understand the English do not drink very much. I am still a very light drinker, but I want to not exceed the delicate sensibilities.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/aug/13/features.magazine67\" title=\"\">Newmark embraces his nerdiness.</a> After university, he worked for the computer giant IBM. He also took ballet and jazz dance classes in an attempt to meet women, but suffered a hernia and was hospitalised. Aged 40, he took a programming job with the financial firm Charles Schwab and moved from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, then switched to more lucrative freelance work.</p> <p>In 1995, he began sending out an email list of events to a dozen friends. As word spread, the group expanded. Before long, the list included job vacancies and places to rent. Soon, Craigslist ruled the world. Looking back now, would he have done anything differently?</p> <p>\u201cIn that time frame, probably not because I got lucky. For example, when the mailing list I was running needed to have a name \u2013 I\u2019m very literal as a nerd; I was gonna call it San Francisco Events \u2013 people around me told me they already called it Craigslist. I had inadvertently created a brand.\u201d</p> <p>But in a portent of the wider web\u2019s dark side, it has been abused by criminals. In 2007, for example, a woman from Minneapolis pleaded guilty to using its personal ads to run an underage prostitution ring. Last year, Craigslist took down its personals section after Congress passed the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, designed to crack down on sex trafficking of children, which could have made the site liable to prosecution when its users broke the law.</p> <p>Newmark could have sold Craigslist for a huge fortune and joined the Silicon Valley super-elite, yet never considered making a quick profit; the site itself remains defiantly basic and unadorned by banner ads. While his home in New York, a former stable dating back to 1848, is certainly swanky and he has another place in San Francisco, Newmark no longer owns a car but prefers to travel in taxis and on public transport.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I had to make Craigslist from a hobby into a real company, I decided, given what I learned in Sunday school, I should monetise it minimally. The business model being: doing well by doing good. That\u2019s a lesson from [his teachers] Mr and Mrs Levin in Sunday school: you should know when enough is enough. In more current terms, it\u2019s no one needs a billion dollars. Also, in very pragmatic terms, take less and give more, so I\u2019m in the process of doing that with forthcoming announcements.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ee129f55e6ac5036cf47a997936c092f2a8edf4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2ee129f55e6ac5036cf47a997936c092f2a8edf4/0_0_3600_4659/773.jpg\" alt=\"Newmark at his home in Greenwich Village.\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newmark at his home in Greenwich Village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Caroll Taveras/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newmark, who married Eileen Whelpley in 2012, adds: \u201cThe deal is I live comfortably. I\u2019m helping my family and some friends live comfortably. That ain\u2019t bad. I can afford to have a garden out there with birds. Children are not a consideration, but we do have 21 nephews and nieces; No 22 is under construction. We\u2019re looking forward to their launch party.\u201d</p> <p>And yet there is a persistent, widespread view that Newmark\u2019s humble-looking site destroyed classified advertising, one of the newspaper industry\u2019s most valuable cash cows. Last October\u2019s New York Times article \u2013 the one that called him a \u201cvillain\u201d \u2013 stated: \u201cResearchers eventually estimated that Craigslist had drained $5bn from American newspapers over a seven-year period. In the Bay Area, the media was especially hard hit.\u201d</p> <p>The decline is continuing and even accelerating. The US media is reportedly facing <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-01/journalism-layoffs-are-at-the-highest-level-since-last-recession\" title=\"\">its worst job losses in a decade</a> with about 3,000 people laid off or offered redundancy in the first five months of this year. Last month, the Vindicator, the sole daily newspaper in Youngstown, Ohio, announced that it was closing after 150 years. \u201cNews deserts\u201d are spreading across the US with alarming implications for democracy.</p> <p>Newmark says: \u201cI feel very strongly about the issue because journalists lose jobs and that\u2019s accelerated this year. But in the last two or three years, I found economists and industry analysts [who have looked] at the numbers \u2013 they adjust for inflation, household growth and all that \u2013 and they say that there\u2019s two things that happened in the early 50s, one of which was TV news, and from there [we have seen] a straight-line decline in newspaper circulation revenues, accelerated 10 years ago by the advent of the platforms.</p> <p>\u201cNow, my gut tells me that Craigslist must have had some effect, but apparently it\u2019s pretty tiny. Mostly it\u2019s just the effect of TV news. Now the other event that happened in the early 50s was my birth but, barring any mention of the book of Revelation, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any effect of any sort.\u201d</p> <p>So does he think he is unfairly demonised by some journalists and does that rankle? \u201cI can\u2019t fault them for not getting around to doing the fact-checking. You know people are busy and a lot of people in journalism have been told by their managers that fact-checking may not be critical.\u201d</p> <p>When the City University of New York (CUNY) named its graduate school of journalism after Newmark following a $20m donation, there was a backlash. Felix Salmon, the chief financial correspondent at the Axios website, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/felixsalmon/status/1006143456975228930\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cIt\u2019s utterly bizarre to name a journalism school after the man who almost single-handedly destroyed local newspapers.\u201d</p> <p>How does that make Newmark feel? \u201cI do wonder why he hasn\u2019t talked to the economists or industry analysts involved,\u201d he says, android-like, before pivoting to a paean for CUNY\u2019s work in giving a break to people from different ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds and boosting diversity in newsrooms.</p> <p>Thus he firmly rejects any notion that all the philanthropy \u2013 an estimated $50m in the past year including to New York Public Radio, <a href=\"https://themarkup.org/\" title=\"\">new publication the Markup</a> and local journalism efforts such as the American Journalism Project \u2013 is an attempt to assuage guilt, a reach for atonement. \u201cThat takes an active imagination that I don\u2019t understand. I have very little imagination.\u201d</p> <p>The ascent of Craigslist, Wikipedia and others also led some to predict that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2009/jun/08/user-generated-content-internet-media\" title=\"\">user-generated content</a> would conquer all, providing the ultimate expression of grassroots democracy. To the storied newsrooms of the US, it was a naive and dangerous fantasy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ae88d348afb66a97b4eae7621e13b7651b31b76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ae88d348afb66a97b4eae7621e13b7651b31b76/0_112_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Newmark in 2006.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Newmark in 2006.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Newmark, by his own admission not a journalist, says: \u201cI had great hopes for citizen journalism 10, 15 years ago. It hasn\u2019t worked out. One reason is that journalism is a profession. You have to know how to write well. You have to fact-check. You have to know how to develop sources, often over years. You have to have specialised knowledge on a beat like disinformation or crime or birds. Citizen journalists can complement what\u2019s going on and, sometimes, citizens come to journalism with skills.</p> <p>\u201cI was way over-optimistic because I didn\u2019t realise the need for professionalism in the manner that I talked about. Now I think more: what are the practical problems of professional journalism? For example, we\u2019ve seen a couple of cases where bad actors will try to really hurt a publication by engaging in lengthy, frivolous lawsuits. There is a great need for shared risk pool insurance, media insurance in the US, and I talk to people about that.\u201d</p> <p>Newmark denies, however, that he was pollyannaish about the web itself, even after the much-publicised bile, poison and rancour of the 2016 presidential election and what some now call a cold civil war in the US. Social media fights, he insists, get attention but are not representative of what is really going on. Much of it is manufactured.</p> <p>\u201cAmericans are much more reasonable and moderate than what you might guess when you see a little Twitter war. But I\u2019m guessing that the purpose of many Twitter wars is to polarise people and, in fact, we\u2019ve seen that happen because you can often trace some of the fighting groups to the same location. Outrage is profitable. Most of the outrage I\u2019ve seen in the online world \u2013 I would guess 80% \u2013 someone\u2019s faking it for profit.\u201d</p> <p>After 24 years at Craigslist, often dealing with customers directly, Newmark reflects: \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at tens or hundreds of ads in a day you get a better grasp of what people are really like than the more dramatic flare-ups. So that\u2019s the basis for my optimism.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, he remains convinced that the internet is still a positive for humanity. \u201cIt allows people of goodwill to get together and work together for common good. Bad actors are much louder, they make for more sensational news and we\u2019re seeing a period of that now. The US, in a way, is lucky. Bad actors interfering with our elections may have had some success but their success is not complete and it means that people of goodwill are fighting back vigorously.</p> <p>\u201cI play a microscopic role in that. I find the people who do the real work and then I help fund them, I get them to talk with each other, and I\u2019m funnier than they are. I remind myself that a nerd\u2019s got to do what a nerd\u2019s got to do and that\u2019s my driving slogan. In my gut, that incorporates the notions of treating people like you want to be treated.\u201d</p> <p>How, then, would he like to be remembered? He considers for a moment before stepping outside to see the birds. \u201cAs a nerd that stayed true to his nerditude,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that I knew that I wasn\u2019t as funny as I think I am.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 and 16 July 2019. An earlier version misnamed mourning doves as \u201cmorning doves\u201d. In addition, it misquoted Craig Newmark as saying \u201c\u2026 don\u2019t amplify this information\u201d, when he said \u201cdon\u2019t amplify disinformation\u201d. This has been corrected.</p>",

This ambivalence was captured by a New York Times headline last October that described Newmark as a \u201cnewspaper villain\u201d and another last month that called him a \u201cnew friend to journalism\u201d. The latter referred to Newmark\u2019s latest act of philanthropy, a $6m (\u00a34.8m) gift to Consumer Reports \u2013 the biggest donation in the 83-year history of the nonprofit watchdog \u2013 that will be used to set up a digital division to scrutinise products and platforms, including social media. \u201cI\u2019m mostly concerned about the way social media platforms can be weaponised, that they sometimes forget to provide informed consent regarding the uses of your personal data,\u201d he explains. \u201cI do feel that any site should tell you what it would like to collect and what it would like to share with others and then ask your permission.\u201d The political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, which harvested the data of up to 87 million Facebook users during the 2016 US presidential election, is one such example, he says. However, Newmark, who has met Facebook\u2019s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, but does not know him well, declines to criticise him or suggest Zuckerberg has created a monster. \u201cI have no idea what he\u2019s done personally. I focus on how we all work on this together. It\u2019s all hands on deck. People need to enlist much like in the US after the attack [on Pearl Harbor] in December of 1941, much like people during the Battle of Britain. There are foreign adversaries who\u2019ve come out, published their public statements and say that they\u2019re at war with us.\u201d Victory is unlikely to be as clear as in the second world war, however. \u201cThe measure of success would be that I would be able to choose from a high number of publications wherein I know that I can trust everything they say with the occasional mistake, which they will then fix. Because news is hard; you\u2019re going to make mistakes, then you correct them and Bob\u2019s your uncle.\u201d Newmark, who has previously observed \u201ca trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy\u201d, prefers not to use the term \u201cfake news\u201d \u2013 perhaps it has been tainted for ever by Donald Trump. He reasons: \u201cSome people have said fake news is news that I don\u2019t like, so I will talk about misinformation or disinformation and that is often either false news or false witness, either weaponised information or just carelessness. \u201cIf it\u2019s carelessness, you can tell someone: \u2018Hey, you got it wrong; here\u2019s the evidence.\u2019 If it\u2019s disinformation, they don\u2019t care, they will just publish it again. Meanwhile, when you point out the problem, they might decide that you\u2019re a target for harassment.\u201d There is an entire ecosystem at work, he continues, that can enable a falsehood from the obscure reaches of the web to jump on to millions of TV screens with dizzying speed. \u201cIt\u2019s a small amount of disinformation originating in some of the social media platforms used by foreign adversaries and their domestic allies. They get amplified: there\u2019s multiple levels including conspiracy sites, then news sites which don\u2019t care about fact-checking. And then once that becomes news, sometimes that emerges into conventional or mainstream media.\u201d How can it be stopped? \u201cPeople in mainstream media can just do things like fact-checking. They could avoid giving airtime or space to people they know routinely disinform and they can just avoid amplifying disinformation.\u201d The new journalism centres he is funding are considering whether journalistic ethics codes should explicitly say: \u201cDon\u2019t amplify disinformation.\u201d If this sounds like a swipe at Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Fox News, Newmark ducks an invitation to be critical. He is similarly circumspect when asked if tech giants should be broken up, if the existence of billionaires is unethical (he is a mere millionaire) or whether the decline of local journalism contributed to the ascent of Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d is his default response. Speaking of the president, Newmark, who has donated to Democratic presidential hopefuls Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren, gives an unorthodox answer when asked what he thinks of his term in office so far. \u201cHe\u2019s been very effective in terms of getting elected.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI am very passionate about understatement. I know the British practise that. I learned little by little. For example, I spent some time in Edinburgh last year and I now really like haggis. I\u2019ve also acquired a taste for Scotch whisky. I understand the English do not drink very much. I am still a very light drinker, but I want to not exceed the delicate sensibilities.\u201d Newmark embraces his nerdiness. After university, he worked for the computer giant IBM. He also took ballet and jazz dance classes in an attempt to meet women, but suffered a hernia and was hospitalised. Aged 40, he took a programming job with the financial firm Charles Schwab and moved from Pittsburgh to San Francisco, then switched to more lucrative freelance work. In 1995, he began sending out an email list of events to a dozen friends. As word spread, the group expanded. Before long, the list included job vacancies and places to rent. Soon, Craigslist ruled the world. Looking back now, would he have done anything differently? \u201cIn that time frame, probably not because I got lucky. For example, when the mailing list I was running needed to have a name \u2013 I\u2019m very literal as a nerd; I was gonna call it San Francisco Events \u2013 people around me told me they already called it Craigslist. I had inadvertently created a brand.\u201d But in a portent of the wider web\u2019s dark side, it has been abused by criminals. In 2007, for example, a woman from Minneapolis pleaded guilty to using its personal ads to run an underage prostitution ring. Last year, Craigslist took down its personals section after Congress passed the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, designed to crack down on sex trafficking of children, which could have made the site liable to prosecution when its users broke the law. Newmark could have sold Craigslist for a huge fortune and joined the Silicon Valley super-elite, yet never considered making a quick profit; the site itself remains defiantly basic and unadorned by banner ads. While his home in New York, a former stable dating back to 1848, is certainly swanky and he has another place in San Francisco, Newmark no longer owns a car but prefers to travel in taxis and on public transport. \u201cWhen I had to make Craigslist from a hobby into a real company, I decided, given what I learned in Sunday school, I should monetise it minimally. The business model being: doing well by doing good. That\u2019s a lesson from [his teachers] Mr and Mrs Levin in Sunday school: you should know when enough is enough. In more current terms, it\u2019s no one needs a billion dollars. Also, in very pragmatic terms, take less and give more, so I\u2019m in the process of doing that with forthcoming announcements.\u201d Newmark, who married Eileen Whelpley in 2012, adds: \u201cThe deal is I live comfortably. I\u2019m helping my family and some friends live comfortably. That ain\u2019t bad. I can afford to have a garden out there with birds. Children are not a consideration, but we do have 21 nephews and nieces; No 22 is under construction. We\u2019re looking forward to their launch party.\u201d And yet there is a persistent, widespread view that Newmark\u2019s humble-looking site destroyed classified advertising, one of the newspaper industry\u2019s most valuable cash cows. Last October\u2019s New York Times article \u2013 the one that called him a \u201cvillain\u201d \u2013 stated: \u201cResearchers eventually estimated that Craigslist had drained $5bn from American newspapers over a seven-year period. In the Bay Area, the media was especially hard hit.\u201d The decline is continuing and even accelerating. The US media is reportedly facing its worst job losses in a decade with about 3,000 people laid off or offered redundancy in the first five months of this year. Last month, the Vindicator, the sole daily newspaper in Youngstown, Ohio, announced that it was closing after 150 years. \u201cNews deserts\u201d are spreading across the US with alarming implications for democracy. Newmark says: \u201cI feel very strongly about the issue because journalists lose jobs and that\u2019s accelerated this year. But in the last two or three years, I found economists and industry analysts [who have looked] at the numbers \u2013 they adjust for inflation, household growth and all that \u2013 and they say that there\u2019s two things that happened in the early 50s, one of which was TV news, and from there [we have seen] a straight-line decline in newspaper circulation revenues, accelerated 10 years ago by the advent of the platforms. \u201cNow, my gut tells me that Craigslist must have had some effect, but apparently it\u2019s pretty tiny. Mostly it\u2019s just the effect of TV news. Now the other event that happened in the early 50s was my birth but, barring any mention of the book of Revelation, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any effect of any sort.\u201d So does he think he is unfairly demonised by some journalists and does that rankle? \u201cI can\u2019t fault them for not getting around to doing the fact-checking. You know people are busy and a lot of people in journalism have been told by their managers that fact-checking may not be critical.\u201d When the City University of New York (CUNY) named its graduate school of journalism after Newmark following a $20m donation, there was a backlash. Felix Salmon, the chief financial correspondent at the Axios website, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s utterly bizarre to name a journalism school after the man who almost single-handedly destroyed local newspapers.\u201d How does that make Newmark feel? \u201cI do wonder why he hasn\u2019t talked to the economists or industry analysts involved,\u201d he says, android-like, before pivoting to a paean for CUNY\u2019s work in giving a break to people from different ethnic, religious and economic backgrounds and boosting diversity in newsrooms. Thus he firmly rejects any notion that all the philanthropy \u2013 an estimated $50m in the past year including to New York Public Radio, new publication the Markup and local journalism efforts such as the American Journalism Project \u2013 is an attempt to assuage guilt, a reach for atonement. \u201cThat takes an active imagination that I don\u2019t understand. I have very little imagination.\u201d The ascent of Craigslist, Wikipedia and others also led some to predict that user-generated content would conquer all, providing the ultimate expression of grassroots democracy. To the storied newsrooms of the US, it was a naive and dangerous fantasy. Newmark, by his own admission not a journalist, says: \u201cI had great hopes for citizen journalism 10, 15 years ago. It hasn\u2019t worked out. One reason is that journalism is a profession. You have to know how to write well. You have to fact-check. You have to know how to develop sources, often over years. You have to have specialised knowledge on a beat like disinformation or crime or birds. Citizen journalists can complement what\u2019s going on and, sometimes, citizens come to journalism with skills. \u201cI was way over-optimistic because I didn\u2019t realise the need for professionalism in the manner that I talked about. Now I think more: what are the practical problems of professional journalism? For example, we\u2019ve seen a couple of cases where bad actors will try to really hurt a publication by engaging in lengthy, frivolous lawsuits. There is a great need for shared risk pool insurance, media insurance in the US, and I talk to people about that.\u201d Newmark denies, however, that he was pollyannaish about the web itself, even after the much-publicised bile, poison and rancour of the 2016 presidential election and what some now call a cold civil war in the US. Social media fights, he insists, get attention but are not representative of what is really going on. Much of it is manufactured. \u201cAmericans are much more reasonable and moderate than what you might guess when you see a little Twitter war. But I\u2019m guessing that the purpose of many Twitter wars is to polarise people and, in fact, we\u2019ve seen that happen because you can often trace some of the fighting groups to the same location. Outrage is profitable. Most of the outrage I\u2019ve seen in the online world \u2013 I would guess 80% \u2013 someone\u2019s faking it for profit.\u201d After 24 years at Craigslist, often dealing with customers directly, Newmark reflects: \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking at tens or hundreds of ads in a day you get a better grasp of what people are really like than the more dramatic flare-ups. So that\u2019s the basis for my optimism.\u201d Indeed, he remains convinced that the internet is still a positive for humanity. \u201cIt allows people of goodwill to get together and work together for common good. Bad actors are much louder, they make for more sensational news and we\u2019re seeing a period of that now. The US, in a way, is lucky. Bad actors interfering with our elections may have had some success but their success is not complete and it means that people of goodwill are fighting back vigorously. \u201cI play a microscopic role in that. I find the people who do the real work and then I help fund them, I get them to talk with each other, and I\u2019m funnier than they are. I remind myself that a nerd\u2019s got to do what a nerd\u2019s got to do and that\u2019s my driving slogan. In my gut, that incorporates the notions of treating people like you want to be treated.\u201d How, then, would he like to be remembered? He considers for a moment before stepping outside to see the birds. \u201cAs a nerd that stayed true to his nerditude,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that I knew that I wasn\u2019t as funny as I think I am.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 15 and 16 July 2019. An earlier version misnamed mourning doves as \u201cmorning doves\u201d. In addition, it misquoted Craig Newmark as saying \u201c\u2026 don\u2019t amplify this information\u201d, when he said \u201cdon\u2019t amplify disinformation\u201d. This has been corrected.",

      "bodyText": "England\u2019s small towns are set to swell with increasing numbers of elderly people as they reject city living amid a hidden housing crisis caused by a lack of appropriate homes for a rapidly ageing population, a new study reveals. Bexhill in East Sussex, Corby in Northamptonshire and Denton in Greater Manchester are forecast to see the biggest increases in populations aged 55 and above during the next two decades, according to the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Centre for Towns thinktank. Failure to improve housing options for the elderly could add hugely to care and NHS costs, with the Building Research Establishment forecasting that inappropriate housing for the over-55s will cost nearly \u00a320bn by 2041. Hip fractures caused by falls on stairs, excess cold and overcrowding are among the threats. Bexhill, and Hartley in Kent, are set for a 19% increase in their over-55 populations by 2041. By contrast, cities and large towns are proving a turn-off for older home movers, with just one in five willing to consider an urban move compared with a third who want to move to a small town, polling commissioned for the study reveals. A lack of space and accessible and adaptable ground-floor homes were among problems cited. The forecasts raise the prospect of rising generational polarisation, with the young increasingly prevalent in cities and unavailable to help look after their elders in towns and villages, where the \u201cdependency ratio\u201d between people aged 65 and over and those aged 15-64 is forecast to rise. The sharpest increases will be in the Yorkshire towns of Ilkley, Catterick and Knaresborough, Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire and Frimley in Surrey. \u201cWell-designed places can ensure that older people can continue to contribute economically and socially for longer,\u201d the report says. \u201cIsolation and not feeling like valued members of the community are major issues that particularly affect older people. Failure to get to grips with this will have severe consequences.\u201d After years of housing policy focused on first-time buyers, the RIBA is now calling on ministers to make it mandatory for all new homes to be accessible for older and disabled people, for councils to allocate sites for \u201cage-friendly\u201d housing and for estate agents to clearly label accessible housing in marketing materials.

I think that the Labour party has to deal with this issue,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>She said Wednesday night\u2019s Panorama programme, which saw eight former Labour whistleblowers speak about their experiences in the complaints team, was \u201cawful\u201d \u2013 suggesting she meant both the issue and the programme itself \u2013 but said she cared more about the issue.</p> \n<p>Labour is to present its official complaint about the programme, including demanding it be removed from the BBC iPlayer until changes are made, pointing to an email quoting the Labour\u2019s director of communications, Seumas Milne, which was edited by the BBC.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe BBC has still provided no explanation as to why the wording in an email from Seumas Milne was changed to give the opposite meaning to the point the programme claimed.

Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>. Then Chris Williamson, a Labour MP and ally of Corbyn, caused an outcry for saying that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video\">&nbsp;the party had been 'too apologetic' about antisemitism complaints</a>. However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated. Then came the announcement that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was placing the party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under formal investigation</a>&nbsp;over antisemitism.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What allegations were made in the BBC Panorama documentary?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In a July 2019 programme, eight whistleblowers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">spoke to a BBC Panorama documentary</a>, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn\u2019s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Labour\u2019s response to the BBC\u2019s Panorama?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled.

The shadow foreign secretary said the party should show it is willing for the EHRC investigation to be given free rein to reform its processes for dealing with antisemitism complaints. However, Thornberry also criticised Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, for his missive to Labour\u2019s general secretary, Jennie Formby, suggesting she might have covered up emails dealing with antisemitism cases, saying it was wrong to target a staff member undergoing cancer treatment. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the soap opera, I care that I have a Jewish member of staff, who when she goes to family weddings, can\u2019t say who she works for, even though I fight on this issue a lot, she cannot say who she works for or what she does, because she doesn\u2019t want to spend the rest of the day defending herself,\u201d Thornberry told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. Thornberry said she did not want to pin the blame on any Labour staffer, aide or politician. \u201cI don\u2019t want to personalise this because I think the issue is more important than a soap opera. I think that the Labour party has to deal with this issue,\u201d she said. She said Wednesday night\u2019s Panorama programme, which saw eight former Labour whistleblowers speak about their experiences in the complaints team, was \u201cawful\u201d \u2013 suggesting she meant both the issue and the programme itself \u2013 but said she cared more about the issue. Labour is to present its official complaint about the programme, including demanding it be removed from the BBC iPlayer until changes are made, pointing to an email quoting the Labour\u2019s director of communications, Seumas Milne, which was edited by the BBC. \u201cThe BBC has still provided no explanation as to why the wording in an email from Seumas Milne was changed to give the opposite meaning to the point the programme claimed. John Ware [the Panorama journalist who made the programme] in an Observer interview acknowledged the email wording had been changed,\u201d a party source said. A party spokesman said the programme should be removed until \u201cbasic facts are corrected, full and unedited quotes are used, and an apology is issued\u201d. He added: \u201cAnalysis found that in the 59 minute programme, the party\u2019s position was on screen for just 5 minutes and 1 second.\u201d Two of the whistleblowers who featured in the programme \u2013 Sam Matthews and Louise Withers Green \u2013 contacted the Observer on Saturday night to say they had instructed the prominent media lawyer Mark Lewis to act on their behalf because they believed the party had defamed them in its response to their claims. On Sunday another whistleblower, Tim Dexter, also broke the terms of his non-disclosure agreement to tell the Sunday Times he had witnessed a culture of \u201cparanoia\u201d at the top of the party and alleged that serious sanctions against members were routinely blocked in cases relating to allegations of antisemitism. Thornberry said the EHRC, which last week sent letters to at least 100 senior Labour figures asking them to give evidence to its inquiry, should be welcomed in to reform the party\u2019s practices. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s a shame and a disgrace that the Equality and Human Rights Commission have been brought in to look at the Labour party, but they have,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think we should now welcome it, open our doors up and say to them, right we have been trying to improve our processes, clearly it\u2019s still not working, can you help us? \u201cIf we can set up, as a result of working with them \u2026 we can set up a process that is tough and an example of good practice, I actually think that would be a good result. Other parties, who also have problems, could look at us as an example of good practice.\u201d A war of words broke out between Watson and Formby in the aftermath of the documentary, which Thornberry also called \u201ca soap opera\u201d. Unite\u2019s general secretary, Len McCluskey, called Watson a \u201cdisgrace\u201d over his criticism of Formby. Asked whether Watson had made an error, Thornberry said: \u201cI wish he wasn\u2019t attacking someone going through chemotherapy, I think that is a mistake. She is the general secretary of the Labour party but we know she is very ill and it is completely inappropriate. Don\u2019t personalise this, that is my point.\u201d On Sunday, 20 Labour MPs, all members of the Tribune Group, issued a statement expressing their shock at the report of the party\u2019s handling of cases and how individual employees had been treated. \u201cWe support former employees in speaking out and commend their bravery in doing so,\u201d the MPs, including Clive Efford, Yvette Cooper and Owen Smith, wrote. \u201cThe Labour party has always and always will support whistleblowers in coming forward when they are concerned about wrongdoing.\u201d",

Released in 1968, The Marble Index was an unsettling collision of modernist classical orchestration, doomy vocals and the discordant throb of a harmonium. \u201cI suspect that if you\u2019re ever in the perfect mood to play The Marble Index, then it\u2019s probably the last thing you should be playing,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2008/oct/14/difficult-albums-nico\">Dorian Lynskey in the Guardian</a>.</p> <p>If you\u2019re going to pay tribute to an experimental album, there\u2019s a logic in putting on an experimental show. Commissioned by the <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/\">Manchester international festival</a>, actor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/maxine-peake\">Maxine Peake</a> and director Sarah Frankcom have assembled an all-female company, including an orchestra from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/royalnortherncollegeofmusic\">Royal Northern College of Music</a> dressed in the tunics and neckerchiefs of the Hitler youth, to evoke something of the singer\u2019s troubled worldview. Unfortunately, in the case of EV Crowe\u2019s script, \u201cexperimental\u201d means never getting to the end of a sentence and never declaring your purpose.</p> <p>Peake could be compelling reading the phone book, and her performance as a woman seemingly possessed by the ghost of Nico is equal parts fascinating and frustrating. With heavy eyeliner and long fringe, she talks cryptically about searching for a person, a feeling, the truth (it\u2019s hard to say for sure), switching from her own voice to the singer\u2019s deep Germanic slur and back again. There\u2019s no doubting the atmosphere of nightmarish desperation, but it\u2019d help to know who she was and why she was taking on Nico\u2019s demons.</p> <p>The uncertainty is doubly frustrating because, when the music kicks in, it can be tremendous. Anna Clyne\u2019s arrangements of songs such as Frozen Warnings and Evening of Light have a scary intensity, all troubling double bass, fidgety violins and strident kettle drums, made edgier still by the terror-stricken look of the players as they scatter about the stage.</p> <p>It ends with Peake alone in the gloom singing an a cappella Nibelungen, but, however bleak and forlorn, its impact is diminished by the lack of context.</p> <p>\u2022 The Nico Project is at <a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/the-nico-project/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIk7__3qC04wIVFODtCh37VAZzEAAYASAAEgLOiPD_BwE\">The Stoller Hall, Manchester</a>, until 21 July.

      "bodyText": "When 1980s Manchester resident Nico released her second solo album, she discarded her image as a beautiful model operating in the world of pop (albeit the warped pop of the Velvet Underground) to create something dark, austere and poetic. Released in 1968, The Marble Index was an unsettling collision of modernist classical orchestration, doomy vocals and the discordant throb of a harmonium. \u201cI suspect that if you\u2019re ever in the perfect mood to play The Marble Index, then it\u2019s probably the last thing you should be playing,\u201d said Dorian Lynskey in the Guardian. If you\u2019re going to pay tribute to an experimental album, there\u2019s a logic in putting on an experimental show. Commissioned by the Manchester international festival, actor Maxine Peake and director Sarah Frankcom have assembled an all-female company, including an orchestra from the Royal Northern College of Music dressed in the tunics and neckerchiefs of the Hitler youth, to evoke something of the singer\u2019s troubled worldview. Unfortunately, in the case of EV Crowe\u2019s script, \u201cexperimental\u201d means never getting to the end of a sentence and never declaring your purpose. Peake could be compelling reading the phone book, and her performance as a woman seemingly possessed by the ghost of Nico is equal parts fascinating and frustrating. With heavy eyeliner and long fringe, she talks cryptically about searching for a person, a feeling, the truth (it\u2019s hard to say for sure), switching from her own voice to the singer\u2019s deep Germanic slur and back again. There\u2019s no doubting the atmosphere of nightmarish desperation, but it\u2019d help to know who she was and why she was taking on Nico\u2019s demons. The uncertainty is doubly frustrating because, when the music kicks in, it can be tremendous. Anna Clyne\u2019s arrangements of songs such as Frozen Warnings and Evening of Light have a scary intensity, all troubling double bass, fidgety violins and strident kettle drums, made edgier still by the terror-stricken look of the players as they scatter about the stage. It ends with Peake alone in the gloom singing an a cappella Nibelungen, but, however bleak and forlorn, its impact is diminished by the lack of context. \u2022 The Nico Project is at The Stoller Hall, Manchester, until 21 July. The Guardian is a media partner of Manchester international festival.",

      "body": "<p>As with all things in wine, there are some people who take serving temperatures very seriously indeed. A few years ago, Richard Geoffroy the showman ex-chef de cave of Champagne Dom P\u00e9rignon, famously spent two years developing an eight-course dinner \u2013 or \u201ccontrolled experiment\u201d \u2013 at the two-Michelin-starred Les Cray\u00e8res restaurant in Reims. Throughout the meal guests were served just one wine \u2013 1996 Dom P\u00e9rignon Oenoth\u00e8que. The twist was that for each course the wine would be served in four glasses at four temperatures rising in increments of 1C from 8-16C as the meal progressed. Geoffroy\u2019s contention was that each degree of temperature brought out a different facet of his uniquely multifaceted wine, with an 8C glass tasting mineral, truffly notes emerging at 13C and nuttiness at 15-16C.</p> <p>But for those of us who don\u2019t have the \u00a3300-odd quid for a bottle of \u201996 Oenoth\u00e8que, let alone the time and patience to re-create such an elaborate experience, we can get an idea of what Geoffroy was driving at merely by pouring ourselves two glasses of sparkling wine: one after a couple of hours in the fridge, and one at room temperature.</p> <p>The colder glass will taste drier, zippier; the warmer glass will feel richer, sweeter. The temperature you prefer will be a matter of taste, of mood and environment. The style of the wine will also play its part: a richer wine will show off more of its richness if you don\u2019t chill it to the bone; a fresh, citrussy, floral fizz will lose its refreshment factor if it\u2019s served too warm</p> <p>The essence of this trial is true of all wines of all colours, with or without bubbles. But it\u2019s still frustratingly rare to find restaurants and bars that give serving temperature more than a rule-bound moment\u2019s thought. In general reds come too warm, at a modern, centrally heated \u201croom temperature\u201d of 20C that makes them feel soupy and tiring rather than the 15C or so that let\u2019s them keep their definition and brightness. Low-tannin, high-acid reds can go much lower: on a hot day there\u2019s nothing better than a properly chilled beaujolais or Loire cabernet franc that\u2019s had an hour in the fridge (or 15 minutes in the freezer).</p> <p>Whites, including manzanilla and fino sherry, ros\u00e9s, orange wines and sparklers, by contrast, are often served too cold: by all means give me a lean, bone-dry white such as muscadet, where fruit is secondary to minerally acids, in a bottle that\u2019s too cold to touch. But if the wine has the richness (from oak, age, or lees- or skin-contact), it pays to give it a little warmth (right up to 15C) to breathe.</p> <p>Still, I can\u2019t bring myself to get too obsessive about serving temperature. Not when I\u2019m in the habit of express-chilling a glass of ros\u00e9 or red with a couple of ice cubes. That might not be the sort of thing you\u2019d get at a DP do.

      "bodyText": "One of Britain\u2019s biggest trade unions has launched an inquiry into longstanding allegations that union officials colluded with a clandestine blacklist which was run and funded by large construction firms to prevent specific workers from getting jobs. The inquiry set up by Unite will examine claims that union officials privately passed information to construction industry managers who compiled secret files on thousands of workers. Previously confidential documents have suggested that union officials warned company managers not to employ some of their own members because they were considered troublemakers. Managers involved in the blacklist have claimed that union officials gave them information as they wanted to prevent disruption on construction sites. The inquiry has been commissioned by Unite\u2019s leader, Len McCluskey, following pressure from blacklisted workers who said the allegations were a \u201crunning sore\u201d for the trade union movement. Details of the inquiry were circulated in an internal letter by Andrew Murray, Unite\u2019s chief of staff, who is also an adviser to the Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn. Murray warned that the position was \u201cquite clear\u201d, that any official found to have colluded with blacklisters would be subjected to the union\u2019s disciplinary rules. A team of lawyers will examine claims that the alleged collusion involved officials still working for Unite as well as those who worked for unions that merged with Unite. The complicity is alleged to have spanned at least three decades to 2009. In a statement, Unite said it was always committed to transparency about this issue, adding: \u201cThis ongoing commitment will see us review all documents that are in the public domain, listen to the accounts of individuals and ask people to come forward with any evidence they want considered.\u201d Evidence of the alleged collusion emerged from documents drawn up for a high court lawsuit which led to more than 1,100 blacklisted workers winning payouts totalling \u00a355m from the construction firms. As part of an out-of-court settlement, eight construction firms, including Sir Robert McAlpine and Balfour Beatty, were compelled to apologise unreservedly to the blacklisted workers. In 2009, an official watchdog had closed down the blacklist after concluding that more than 40 construction firms had unlawfully stored secret files on more than 3,200 trade unionists. Construction industry managers pooled information about the workers\u2019 employment records, political views, health and personal relationships in the files. When workers applied for jobs, the managers ran their names through the files to vet them. Those considered by managers as politically awkward were rejected, and not told why. Some of the workers were denied work for long periods. Some files recorded how the workers had raised simple health and safety concerns on construction sites. The files suggested trade union officials had described individual workers as \u201cmilitant\u201d, a troublemaker or with a warning to be \u201ccareful\u201d. For 30 years, Daniel O\u2019Sullivan was a construction industry manager who was once chairman of the Consulting Association, the bland name given to the secret agency that managed the blacklist. According to the legal documents, O\u2019Sullivan said he often met trade union officials as part of his job. He said the officials gave him information about particular individuals as they were \u201cconcerned to prevent unnecessary disruption on site\u201d. He cited as an example a worker who was described in his file as a \u201ctroublemaker\u201d by a union official in 2005. Another former construction industry manager, Dudley Barratt, has said union officials gave him names of individuals they thought should not be employed as there was a \u201cquiet acceptance\u201d by some unions of the blacklist and the \u201cbenefits\u201d of vetting workers who could be disruptive. Alan Wainwright, a former manager who blew the whistle on the blacklist, has said he told officials at the Amicus trade union, which later merged with Unite, about the blacklist as early as 2005 but his evidence was ignored. Unite\u2019s lawyers have helped a large number of blacklisted workers to secure compensation in legal actions which concluded in May. McCluskey promised to launch the inquiry after the legal action had ended. Dave Smith, secretary of the Blacklist Support Group which represents blacklisted workers, said his group had received \u201cassurances from Unite that the entire process will be carried out by senior counsel and solicitors independently from the union. This is essential and we applaud the union for committing to such a transparent investigation \u2013 we intend to hold the union to that promise.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 July 2019 because Unite is one of Britain\u2019s biggest trade unions, not the biggest as an earlier version said.",

Anyone who signs up for those 26 miles has a kind of reckless determination, but for Strippel, who had worked as a head chef in Cornish hotels and restaurants for much of his career, the challenge had become a very singular mission. That mission had begun just seven months earlier when, aged 37, Strippel had been within one small step of taking his own life.</p> <p>Sitting in a cafe in London, he could recall that evening in September 2018 both as if it were yesterday and as part of another existence entirely. At the time he was working on his own in the kitchen at a hotel restaurant near Penzance. It had been a long hot summer and Strippel had, for as long as he could remember, been in the habit of trying to drown all the tiredness and stress of the kitchen in alcohol.</p> <p>\u201cWorking on your own in the summer in a kitchen is bloody hard,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was just a kitchen porter and me. Most days I\u2019d have a whole long row of tickets for orders. The kitchen was open 11am until 8.30pm. I could handle it all, but only if I never talked to anyone while I worked. I had a massive charcoal grill, two fryers, a fish fryer, two big hobs, a grill and an oven and I would be working the whole lot myself. I was getting \u00a310.65 an hour.\u201d When the kitchen eventually closed he would do his cleaning and get the ordering done and would be finished at 10.30pm. His mates were behind the bar and in front of it. It was always: are you having a drink tonight, Craig? Of course he was.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are side effects with every job, but with chefs it was usually drugs and alcohol</p> <footer> <cite>Craig Strippel</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The truth was that he\u2019d have been drinking most of the day already. When he got in, a colleague would offer him a beer and he would probably have had three or four pints before the lunch rush began. He\u2019d ask for a pint of wine for the cooking, but he only needed a splash of it for his crab linguine so he would drink the rest. People would tip him with drinks, so by the end of the week there would be eight or nine pints waiting. He only used drugs when he was drinking, he says. He\u2019d take something to sober himself up enough so he could drink some more. Sometimes he lost two or three days in this way \u2013 he could spend \u00a3500 in a weekend, no problem \u2013 but mostly he just kept going to work; he had a partner and three young kids at home.</p> <p>As with all addiction, Strippel thought for a long time that he could cope with it, then he knew for a terrifying fact that he could not. \u201cThe last summer it just got worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to the point in September when I honestly could not see a way out. I went out drinking with my mates and I was saying to them, \u2018Big party tonight because it is the last night I will drink.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Strippel left his mates in the early hours and walked to a place along the coast. \u201cI stood there and I wanted to jump but my legs wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. And then there was a kind of <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life</em> moment. \u201cA guy who was out fishing spotted me and shone a torchlight on me from his boat,\u201d Strippel recalled. \u201cHe just kept the light on me, and I felt I couldn\u2019t move.\u201d The fisherman called the lifeguard and soon there was a helicopter, a lifeboat and police negotiators. After an hour and a half Strippel was talked down with the promise of a cigarette. </p> <p>The story is not a wholly unusual one in an industry that has long had disturbing and disproportionate levels of addiction and mental health problems.

The suicide of Anthony Bourdain last year, the chef who did so much to create that high-adrenaline charge around cooking, provoked a lot of soul-searching. Bourdain had conquered a heroin and crack-cocaine addiction; he had never given up on a love of booze: \u201cYou see me drink myself stupid on my show all the time \u2026 When I indulge, I indulge.\u201d There has since been a series of confessionals from high-profile chefs, who have acknowledged the potential self-destructiveness of that mythology. David MacMillan of Joe Beef \u2013 who Bourdain called \u201cthe rogue prince of hospitality\u201d \u2013 had made his restaurant a byword for excess of all kinds. \u201cThe community of people I surrounded myself with ate and drank like Vikings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt worked well in my 20s. It worked well in my 30s. It started to unravel when I was 40. I couldn\u2019t shut it off.\u201d Now, after a period in rehab, he has become an evangelist for greater duty of care in the heat of the kitchen.</p> <p>Tom Kerridge, of the Hand and Flowers, has been frank about a similar personal reckoning. \u201cAlcohol had gained a grip,\u201d he said on <em>Desert Island Discs</em>. \u201cI was drinking colossal amounts. I would always be the last man standing, driving it on. At the end of service I would order a pint of negroni, just as a starter \u2026 I have completely destroyed alcohol for myself. I\u2019m untrustworthy with it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6e1b7f77b6934a4d650d03bbdb7252aba91f64d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6e1b7f77b6934a4d650d03bbdb7252aba91f64d5/0_110_4992_2996/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Live CNN Talk Show \u201cParts Unknown Last Bite\u201d Hosted By Anthony BourdainLAS VEGAS, NV - NOVEMBER 10: TV Personality Anthony Bourdain attends \u201cParts Unknown Last Bite\u201d Live CNN Talk Show hosted by Anthony Bourdain at Atomic Liquors on November 10, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada. 24280_001_0202.JPG (Photo by Isaac Brekken/WireImage)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anthony Bourdain: he had conquered a heroin and crack-cocaine addiction but had never given up on a love of booze.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Isaac Brekken/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One result has been a generational shift, even among alpha-males who run kitchens. When Gordon Ramsay, another prime mover in that previous culture, made a heartfelt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/20/gordon-ramsay-cocaine-chef-colombian-jungles-drug-petrol-coca-leaves-restaurant-trade\" title=\"\">documentary</a> in 2017 about the destructiveness of the cocaine trade \u2013 after a young chef he had worked with fell to his death after taking the drug \u2013 he talked about efforts to outlaw the \u201cfood industry\u2019s dirty little secret\u201d. Neil Rankin of the pit-barbecue pioneer Temper suggested bluntly in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/gordon-ramsay-cocaine-documentary-neil-rankin-itv-show-restaurants-chef-a8027676.html\" title=\"\">Facebook post</a> that Ramsay\u2019s fondness for long-hours culture hadn\u2019t helped: \u201cOh fuck off Gordon.

Like many chefs, Strippel drifted into the kitchen. He had a live-in job as a commis chef at 16. One of his early jobs was as a kind of troubleshooter, pitching up in failing kitchens in his whites, checking out the fridges, raising standards before moving on. The real sleep deprivation \u2013 and the compensatory drinking \u2013 kicked in when he worked as a senior chef, starting at half five in the morning and finishing at half past one five days a week.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4dfb0319a906b07d031cac1f1dd28abd73231197\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4dfb0319a906b07d031cac1f1dd28abd73231197/0_1113_4801_6001/800.jpg\" alt=\"Craig wearing his London Marathon Finishers Medal\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craig wearing his London Marathon Finisher\u2019s Medal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere are probably side effects with every job,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with chefs it was usually drugs and alcohol. I would have the weekend off and I was living in Warminster, near the barracks, so there were always squaddies around. I made a lot of friends who weren\u2019t friends.\u201d</p> <p>When he moved to Cornwall he worked for a while with Rick Stein in Padstow \u2013 \u201cprobably the most laid back of anyone I worked for\u201d \u2013 and then jobbing around various hotels. I wonder if he was infected by that Bourdain \u201clife on the edge\u201d mythology.</p> <p>He says he recognised it, but it wasn\u2019t the main reason. \u201cThe money was really good to start with,\u201d he says. He was getting \u00a332,000 a year at that senior chef job and only a few hours of free time to spend any of it.</p> <p>The day after the suicide attempt Strippel called Addaction, a charity that helps addicts one-to-one. He went to his first AA meeting. And he called into work to explain why he wasn\u2019t coming in that day, or any day. Though he had sometimes gone awol over the years, no employer had once asked if he needed help.</p> <p>Strippel was never a runner before he stopped drinking. But not long after his crisis his eldest son asked if he would join him in a charity 10k. He ran it in an hour and it almost killed him, but he was hooked and started running the coast paths every day. \u201cI have got that care inside of me, I care about myself again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/08/adrian-chiles-honest-about-alcohol-drinks-industry-dangers\">I\u2019ve been honest about alcohol.

He was going to work as a kitchen porter to begin with, just to see how it felt. \u201cI need to work,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Cornwall so there aren\u2019t that many options.

Before London he had never run more than 16 miles. On the day itself it was at about that point that his legs went, he told me, but a girl running alongside him insisted: \u201cYour brain is telling you that you are done, but your legs don\u2019t have to believe it.\u201d Strippel had heard that particular voice in his head once before. The final 365 yards down the Mall were the longest he has ever contemplated, but there was not only an end in sight, but also a new beginning.</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.addaction.org.uk/\">Addaction.org.uk</a>; In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

As with all addiction, Strippel thought for a long time that he could cope with it, then he knew for a terrifying fact that he could not. \u201cThe last summer it just got worse and worse,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to the point in September when I honestly could not see a way out. I went out drinking with my mates and I was saying to them, \u2018Big party tonight because it is the last night I will drink.\u2019\u201d Strippel left his mates in the early hours and walked to a place along the coast. \u201cI stood there and I wanted to jump but my legs wouldn\u2019t do it,\u201d he said. And then there was a kind of It\u2019s a Wonderful Life moment. \u201cA guy who was out fishing spotted me and shone a torchlight on me from his boat,\u201d Strippel recalled. \u201cHe just kept the light on me, and I felt I couldn\u2019t move.\u201d The fisherman called the lifeguard and soon there was a helicopter, a lifeboat and police negotiators. After an hour and a half Strippel was talked down with the promise of a cigarette. The story is not a wholly unusual one in an industry that has long had disturbing and disproportionate levels of addiction and mental health problems. Chefs are nearly twice as likely to be addicted to alcohol and drugs as the wider population and 9% more vulnerable to suicide. In a 2017 survey a shocking 51% of people who worked in kitchens confessed to debilitating stress and depression. Some of these statistics have been fuelled by a working culture which, through the 1990s and 2000s fetishised extreme pressure and made the kitchen seem like a war zone. The suicide of Anthony Bourdain last year, the chef who did so much to create that high-adrenaline charge around cooking, provoked a lot of soul-searching. Bourdain had conquered a heroin and crack-cocaine addiction; he had never given up on a love of booze: \u201cYou see me drink myself stupid on my show all the time \u2026 When I indulge, I indulge.\u201d There has since been a series of confessionals from high-profile chefs, who have acknowledged the potential self-destructiveness of that mythology. David MacMillan of Joe Beef \u2013 who Bourdain called \u201cthe rogue prince of hospitality\u201d \u2013 had made his restaurant a byword for excess of all kinds. \u201cThe community of people I surrounded myself with ate and drank like Vikings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt worked well in my 20s. It worked well in my 30s. It started to unravel when I was 40. I couldn\u2019t shut it off.\u201d Now, after a period in rehab, he has become an evangelist for greater duty of care in the heat of the kitchen. Tom Kerridge, of the Hand and Flowers, has been frank about a similar personal reckoning. \u201cAlcohol had gained a grip,\u201d he said on Desert Island Discs. \u201cI was drinking colossal amounts. I would always be the last man standing, driving it on. At the end of service I would order a pint of negroni, just as a starter \u2026 I have completely destroyed alcohol for myself. I\u2019m untrustworthy with it.\u201d One result has been a generational shift, even among alpha-males who run kitchens. When Gordon Ramsay, another prime mover in that previous culture, made a heartfelt documentary in 2017 about the destructiveness of the cocaine trade \u2013 after a young chef he had worked with fell to his death after taking the drug \u2013 he talked about efforts to outlaw the \u201cfood industry\u2019s dirty little secret\u201d. Neil Rankin of the pit-barbecue pioneer Temper suggested bluntly in a Facebook post that Ramsay\u2019s fondness for long-hours culture hadn\u2019t helped: \u201cOh fuck off Gordon. Try doing something positive rather than glorifying kitchen abuse, telling chefs today they have to work the stupid hours that you did (and probably hated) and now saying everyone\u2019s on drugs. Things are looking up for chefs. We\u2019re trying to treat them like adults, partners and employees for the first time in decades and give them a future beyond burning out at 30.\u201d Ramsay recently acknowledged the changing roles: \u201cThere\u2019s a responsibility we all have to ensure that there are areas of support for when people stumble and struggle \u2013 and that includes in the workplace \u2026 and that includes me.\u201d The statistics \u2013 and stories like Strippel\u2019s \u2013 suggest that across the industry there is still plenty of work to do. Like many chefs, Strippel drifted into the kitchen. He had a live-in job as a commis chef at 16. One of his early jobs was as a kind of troubleshooter, pitching up in failing kitchens in his whites, checking out the fridges, raising standards before moving on. The real sleep deprivation \u2013 and the compensatory drinking \u2013 kicked in when he worked as a senior chef, starting at half five in the morning and finishing at half past one five days a week. \u201cThere are probably side effects with every job,\u201d he says. \u201cBut with chefs it was usually drugs and alcohol. I would have the weekend off and I was living in Warminster, near the barracks, so there were always squaddies around. I made a lot of friends who weren\u2019t friends.\u201d When he moved to Cornwall he worked for a while with Rick Stein in Padstow \u2013 \u201cprobably the most laid back of anyone I worked for\u201d \u2013 and then jobbing around various hotels. I wonder if he was infected by that Bourdain \u201clife on the edge\u201d mythology. He says he recognised it, but it wasn\u2019t the main reason. \u201cThe money was really good to start with,\u201d he says. He was getting \u00a332,000 a year at that senior chef job and only a few hours of free time to spend any of it. The day after the suicide attempt Strippel called Addaction, a charity that helps addicts one-to-one. He went to his first AA meeting. And he called into work to explain why he wasn\u2019t coming in that day, or any day. Though he had sometimes gone awol over the years, no employer had once asked if he needed help. Strippel was never a runner before he stopped drinking. But not long after his crisis his eldest son asked if he would join him in a charity 10k. He ran it in an hour and it almost killed him, but he was hooked and started running the coast paths every day. \u201cI have got that care inside of me, I care about myself again.\u201d When I spoke to him before the marathon he suggested that he couldn\u2019t ever work in a kitchen again, but three months later he had changed his mind about that and felt strong enough to take a job at Mackerel Sky, the noted fish restaurant in Newlyn. He was going to work as a kitchen porter to begin with, just to see how it felt. \u201cI need to work,\u201d he said, \u201cand this is Cornwall so there aren\u2019t that many options. It\u2019s all I can do.\u201d He was hopeful it would be fine. \u201cIt\u2019s a minute\u2019s walk away and my shifts end at 8.30pm.\u201d He would be sure to head straight home, he said, because he liked to get up early these days for a run. He had other marathons in mind, New York, Paris, Boston, now he knew what was involved. Before London he had never run more than 16 miles. On the day itself it was at about that point that his legs went, he told me, but a girl running alongside him insisted: \u201cYour brain is telling you that you are done, but your legs don\u2019t have to believe it.\u201d Strippel had heard that particular voice in his head once before. The final 365 yards down the Mall were the longest he has ever contemplated, but there was not only an end in sight, but also a new beginning.

      "body": "<p>Eventually, even the most intrepid adventurer has to come home. In the past 20 years Bruce Parry has been initiated, for our viewing pleasure, into indigenous tribes in Congo, Venezuela and Mongolia. He has had thorns forced through his nose in Papua New Guinea and has hunted crocodiles in Ethiopia. He has navigated the Amazon and sledged across the Arctic. His latest adventure in assimilation, however, is perhaps his most formidable challenge yet. In October last year the BBC ethnographer, former Royal Marines fitness instructor and determined hedonist moved from his long-time base in Ibiza to an isolated hamlet in mid-Wales. He plans to be here for many years to come.</p> <p>I met him for lunch in the only cafe for 10 miles around, Cwtch in Pont rhyd-y groes, which is built above a gorge of the Ystwyth river beside the old workings of a lead mine. Parry has cycled from his cottage beside a waterfall on the neighbouring Hafod estate. It\u2019s a significant lunch for Parry in that the salad leaves \u2013 seven varieties \u2013 at the cafe are the first crop from a community garden project that he has helped to establish in the walled garden of the demolished estate manor house.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are being fed this information that it is money and stuff that will make you happy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Food was one of the reasons that he ended up here.

He has made no secret of indulging in all the delights that Ibiza can offer \u2013 as well as taking just about every hallucinogen under the sun in order to be fully accepted in different jungle communities. He turned 50 in March. How, I wonder, did he cope with his first wet Welsh winter?</p> <p>\u201cI feel that was my initiation,\u201d he says, smiling. He has a wood fire. \u201cI spent most of the winter in a hat and scarf inside. I survived that OK, though I haven\u2019t met the midges yet \u2013 I think that\u2019s August.\u201d</p> <p>Just in 10 minutes sitting in Cwtch \u2013 the name means both cosy corner and hug \u2013 you can see Parry\u2019s gift for connection with people. He knows everyone who comes in like an old mate. Dom, the chef and proprietor here, and now purveyor of \u201cwalled-garden lettuce\u201d, is greeted with genuine affection, and each delicious vegetarian dish off the specials board he brings out produces fresh rapture from Parry. \u201cYou\u2019re on fire today, Dom!\u201d</p> <p>There is more to Parry\u2019s return than any kind of homesickness. He believed, having had an immersive understanding of the wisdom of some of the oldest human communities, that he should now try to put some of that into practice in the place he fell to earth. Parry had spent four or five years up to 2017 making a very personal film, <em><a href=\"https://www.tawai.earth/\" title=\"\">Tawai: A Voice From the Forest</a></em>. It was both a portrait of the perilous, joyful existence of one of the last hunter-gatherer societies, the Penan people of Borneo, and a meditation on the ways in which we are destroying their world \u2013 and our planet.</p> <p>\u201c<em>Tawai</em> was the last project,\u201d he says. \u201cI guess I thought I had seen it all, but then I met the Penan and there was something completely different about them.\u201d It was not only that they had a genuine pre-agricultural existence, of the kind that humans lived for 85% of the lifetime of our species. \u201cThey had no competition, no hierarchy. They were the only group I had been in that had no pecking order, no chief, no elders.\u201d</p> <p>He was struck by what such an egalitarian heritage might mean. Parry\u2019s journeys along the Amazon and across the Arctic had long since impressed on him the crisis that our planet is facing, a crisis of climate, and of consumerism, and he felt it was no longer enough to report the issues, he had to try to live what felt like possible solutions. His plan is to open up his house and create a small experiment in communal living.</p> <p>\u201cI have no doubt that human beings have problems ahead,\u201d he says. \u201cReally big problems. And we are not doing it right.\u201d The BBC was keen for him to carry on \u201cgallivanting\u201d: \u201cLet\u2019s go down the Mekong, we can talk about important things \u2026!\u201d and there was no doubt some temptation in that. \u201cBut the problem is not really how China is polluting its rivers.

He has no kids and, he says, no particular yearning for any. \u201cWithout question there is a lot of me that loves freedom,\u201d he says. \u201cBut my driving force now is that I am madly trying to figure out what my role can be in moving this community idea forwards \u2013 though maybe what I am proposing is only valid for what comes out of the ashes of the next big financial crash.\u201d There is no doubt he will be well placed to survive catastrophe. He is trying to live mostly from what he can forage \u2013 he loves cooking, he says, though he fears that love is not always shared by guests. \u201cI make my own bread, grind my own wheat, soak my own pulses. I have 25kg of wheat, huge tubs of chickpeas and lentils. If I\u2019m ever stuck for a couple of months, I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I wonder if the BBC are keen to film this latest venture? He suggests they would like to, but his new Welsh friends insist it will be over their dead bodies. \u201cI definitely think I have more to share on this, though,\u201d he says, with a laugh. We exercise that principle in the first instance by taking two forks to Dom\u2019s lemon drizzle cake. Bruce Parry is at Port Eliot festival, 25-29 July, St Germans, Cornwall; porteliotfestival.com",

      "body": "<p>This is fuckin\u2019 <em>inner sanctum</em>,\u201d says Pamela Adlon. We\u2019re speaking over FaceTime, and this is a quiet morning in Los Angeles for her. Her writers are about to turn up and start working on season four of <em>Better Things</em>, the neat, witty and often beautiful comedy loosely based on Adlon\u2019s own life. As soon as she\u2019s finished ordering lunch for her team, and sage to cleanse the energy of the office \u2013 this is the West Coast, after all \u2013 she leaps up and launches straight into a virtual tour. She shows me the lanterns that make the place cosy, and an old black-and-white picture of her English mother wearing her Canadian Air Force uniform. There\u2019s a record player and a shelf full of vinyl. \u201cLook at this!\u201d she yells, as we whizz past a piece of paper taped on to a door that reads CRYING ROOM. \u201cYou know, you just need a room where you can go and cry,\u201d she shrugs. \u201cWe got these movie theatre seats, and it has chargers, and here is a little pedal bike and there\u2019s an African chair I got at a flea market.\u201d She makes me promise not to read the board on the wall behind her, where the plots are being worked out. \u201cStop it!\u201d she shouts, grinning. \u201cCover your eyes!\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I tell my girlfriends, that\u2019s what real thighs look like. I\u2019m like: brave, bitch! So brave</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adlon spends a lot of time in this inner sanctum. She writes and directs <em>Better Things</em>, the show she created about Sam Fox, whom she plays, a single mother who is a jobbing actor raising her three daughters in LA, just like she is. (Its first season ran in the UK earlier this year; the second, a low-key candidate for best comedy on TV, is about to begin.) Quietly brilliant, it is an unsentimental look at family life and working single mothers \u2013 blunt, warm, fascinated by the absurdity of trying to hold it all together. Which, it turns out, is exactly what Adlon is like in real life. At times, trying to keep her on track in a conversation can be like filling a leaky bucket. \u201cThat is probably not what you asked me. I tend to go off the rails,\u201d she says at one point, segueing from a story about selling all of her possessions in her 20s to her mother being born during the Blitz.</p> <p>The show, which does not shy away from the difficulties of raising three young women under one roof, or looking after an elderly and increasingly dotty mother who lives next door, is often described as \u201craw\u201d. \u201cI like raw,\u201d Adlon protests. \u201cI prefer raw to \u2018brave\u2019. When people are like, \u2018You\u2019re so brave...\u2019\u201d She grabs a fistful of her legs. She has no qualms about appearing on screen in her pants. \u201cI tell my girlfriends, that\u2019s what real thighs look like. I\u2019m like: brave, bitch! So brave.\u201d</p> <p><em>Better Things</em> is about finding the humour and the heart in divorce, death, bad decisions, in not having enough time for your kids or your work, in having to grind to get by. \u201cI think the theme throughout the show is, there\u2019s hope and there\u2019s love and there\u2019s laughter, amidst all this dark shit, you know? There\u2019s a flower growing up through a turd,\u201d she explains, succinctly. \u201cI like to feel hope, and I like to laugh at things that are dark. You need somebody in your life, if you\u2019re having the worst possible fucking day, to laugh at you. To point at you and say, \u2018Oh bro, that\u2019s hysterical.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe9a08b8fc81130a919493debb3da276fac5c025\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fe9a08b8fc81130a919493debb3da276fac5c025/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Family television: (from left) Pamela Adlon as Sam, Hannah Alligood as Frankie, Mikey Madison as Max and Olivia Edward as Duke in Better Things.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Family television: (from left) Pamela Adlon as Sam, Hannah Alligood as Frankie, Mikey Madison as Max and Olivia Edward as Duke in Better Things.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the past, Adlon has called <em>Better Things</em> \u201csemi-autobiographical\u201d. Today she is measured about the similarities between the show and her life. \u201cWell, I have three daughters, I\u2019m a single mom, I have an English mother, I\u2019m an actor,\u201d she shrugs \u2013 but she also admits that she has spent her whole life watching, writing things down, gathering material to use. Her eccentric English mother, played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/15/celia-imrie-on-victoria-wood-writing-novels-and-being-caught-in-the-nice-terror-attack\" title=\"\">Celia Imrie</a>, loves being written into the series. \u201cBecause when I tell her, \u2018Mom, you\u2019re being extra sassy right now,\u2019 she says, \u2018You love it! You get more material for your show.\u2019\u201d She nods. \u201cI can\u2019t argue.\u201d</p> <p>She was at the gym with her friend recently. \u201cAnd she\u2019s literally the most miserable person in the world. She starts talking, and she\u2019s crying, and crying. And I turn to the woman next to me and I go, \u2018You know why she\u2019s crying? Cos her husband just left her. Two kids. She\u2019s almost 50.\u2019 And she\u2019s working out, and she starts laughing hysterically, through her tears. Isn\u2019t it hilarious?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even tell you this, because I\u2019m making it a scene in the show.\u201d Another friend told her recently that she\u2019d always assumed Adlon wasn\u2019t listening to her. \u201cAnd then she saw my show, and she said, \u2018I realise you\u2019re <em>really listening</em>.\u2019 I\u2019m surprised that people don\u2019t tread more lightly around me.\u201d</p> <p>Now 52, Adlon has been a professional actor since she was 10. She was a child star in a popular US sitcom <em>The Facts of Life</em>, and appeared alongside Lorna Luft and Michelle Pfeiffer as a wisecracking kid sister in <em>Grease 2</em>. For the most part, she says, she felt protected in those environments. But talking about those years brings back memories. There was an independent film and a scene in a swimming pool. \u201cAnd the director said, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if you dropped the towel for a minute, and we saw your butt, just for a minute?\u2019 And I was 15 years old. I had to kiss a boy in that movie, too, and I hadn\u2019t done that. And I remember being really uncomfortable and feeling scared, because what are the parameters? The kid actor looked at me and said, \u2018An apple is an apple, a plum is a plum, a kiss isn\u2019t a kiss without the tongue.\u2019 And I was just <em>gutted</em>.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"325d3aca4fd5bb6027cdca993e74ddfc19a4659a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/325d3aca4fd5bb6027cdca993e74ddfc19a4659a/0_44_4432_2660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Real life: Pamela Adlon (glasses) in 2017 with her daughters, from left, Odessa, Rocky and Gideon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real life: Pamela Adlon (glasses) in 2017 with her daughters, from left, Odessa, Rocky and Gideon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Buckner/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It was a shock to go from being famous and on television as a kid to being in her 20s, on unemployment benefits, having to sell her possessions. The loss of her record collection, in particular, still smarts. \u201cOh! Do you have to bring that up? I\u2019m still upset. I can see the records,\u201d she says. But she realised that, with her unique smoke and honey voice, she could earn her living another way. \u201cI started hitting it in voiceover and animation,\u201d she explains, which sustained her for much of her career; her biggest voice job was as Bobby in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/aug/20/your-next-box-set-king-of-the-hill\" title=\"\">King of the Hill</a></em>. In the new season of <em>Better Things</em>, she has a character say, \u201cI know you were Rooster on <em>Ching of the Mill</em>.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even bother making up a new title.\u201d</p> <p>Like Sam Fox, Adlon is a jobbing actor, and her work rate has been so prodigious that her CV has the heft of a weighty novel: \u201cNo job too big or small, is my motto, and every single job led me to where I am.\u201d She spent several years as Marcy Runkle in <em>Californication</em>, the explicit, hedonistic Showtime series, where she played a foul-mouthed wisecracker who regularly shot off insults like \u201cDie young and suffer, dickless.\u201d When her eldest daughter, Gideon, was starting a new school, Adlon told her: \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be people who watch the show, and it\u2019s a show for adults.\u201d She didn\u2019t want the kids to watch it just because their friend\u2019s mother was in it. \u201cBut what an innocent time that was! Because now the shit that kids watch on their phones and everything? Forget it!\u201d She remembers a parent coming up to her, with her 12-year-old and nine-year-old in tow. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh Pamela, we watch your show, we love it.\u2019\u201d She cackles. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You\u2019re kidding?\u2019 And she said, \u2018No no, we love it.\u2019 And then her little nine-year-old was like, \u2018Yah, it\u2019s really good.\u2019 I looked at her and said: \u2018The show is not for kids.\u2019\u201d She slips into stern parent mode. \u201cI mean, how do you explain \u2018stunt cock\u2019 to your nine-year-old daughter?\u201d she says. \u201cFuckin\u2019 asshole.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a8a0b41c0a8b7ca74255ed24801372837db79fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a8a0b41c0a8b7ca74255ed24801372837db79fa/0_47_3147_1889/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Foul-mouthed wisecracker: Adlon in Californication with Evan Handler.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Foul-mouthed wisecracker: Adlon in Californication with Evan Handler.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection Christophel/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around the same time as <em>Californication</em>, Adlon was working closely with her friend and collaborator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a> on his series <em>Lucky Louie</em> and <em>Louie</em>. He later returned production and writing favours on the first two seasons of <em>Better Thing</em>s. Then allegations of sexual misconduct against CK surfaced in 2017, and Adlon found herself caught in the crossfire, her own show hanging in the balance through its association with him. She spoke about how \u201cdevastating\u201d it was in an interview with the <em>New Yorker</em>, but the only condition of this conversation was that we wouldn\u2019t bring him up today. One of the more peculiar aspects of the #MeToo groundswell has been women being asked to answer for men\u2019s transgressions; it seems reasonable to not ask her to do so again. Besides, <em>Better Things</em> did not exactly sink without CK, who was not involved in season three. When Adlon took sole charge, critics praised it for finding its voice and a new sense of invention.</p> <p>Adlon is a single mother; she got married in the mid-90s, and divorced a decade ago. Her ex-husband, the father of her kids, moved to Europe. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him,\u201d she says, in a rare closed moment, though she leans into the screen, and adds: \u201cReally not convenient for drop-offs on the weekend, and stuff like that.\u201d She always knew that she had <em>Better Things</em> in her, but it took her years to feel ready to go ahead and make it, in part because she was raising three young children alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8692cac79011e145dcbe663ea13424f20a0a80e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8692cac79011e145dcbe663ea13424f20a0a80e/0_415_2336_1401/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cartoon capers: Adlon was the voice of Bobby in King of the Hill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cartoon capers: Adlon was the voice of Bobby in King of the Hill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI had to say no to a lot of things, because I did not want to take on more than I could handle,\u201d she says. The final push came when she was working on a big budget, big network television show \u2013 she won\u2019t tell me the name of it, but will say, \u201cIt was fuckin\u2019 awful, a circling-the-drain, terrible, American television show\u201d \u2013 and a Friday turned into a Saturday, and it was midnight, and they still hadn\u2019t finished half of what they were supposed to. \u201cIce water went through my veins and it was like, \u2018Don\u2019t these people have families? What the fuck are they doing?\u2019 That was the moment that I thought, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m ready to do this.\u201d</p> <p>Her three daughters, now 21, 18 and 16, are \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of her. \u201cThey see their mom being a boss and running a show, and hiring a ton of people, and how important this job is to so many people. It\u2019s absolutely an unbelievable situation. To see their mom really make it big when she hit 50, after kind of just middling the line for so long...\u201d This seems to go against the traditional Hollywood narrative, that women have an expiration date. \u201cI think it\u2019s still true, but it\u2019s less true,\u201d Adlon says. \u201cI think that if you can make yourself viable, anything is possible.\u201d She does, however, think she should have started directing sooner. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t just stayed in one lane for so long. That bothers me, that I was myopic in that way. Now I have six jobs, and I wish that I had kind of committed to doing that, instead of, oh, I only act.\u201d</p> <p>Still, she is a firm believer in everything happening for a reason. There is an earth mother warmth to Adlon, and it\u2019s not just the sage, or the crying room. She has taken her own industry experiences and used them to ensure that the patterns are not repeated. \u201cAll of those things really helped me,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo for example, when I did <em>Californication</em>, there were so many young women who came on the show, and they had to do nudity, or do a simulated sex scene, or make out. And so I just made it my mission to try and soothe people and talk them through it and say, don\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with, or don\u2019t be ashamed, or love your body now, but don\u2019t ever get pushed into doing something you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d The number one priority on <em>Better Things</em>, she says, is that \u201cI would never ask somebody to do something that I wouldn\u2019t do myself, and that they wouldn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable doing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df748de73422d6a4e412cab68f00a1d6d4e1eae6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df748de73422d6a4e412cab68f00a1d6d4e1eae6/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Mom, you\u2019re being extra sassy right now\u2019: Pamela Adlon in Better Things with Celia Imrie as her mother.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mom, you\u2019re being extra sassy right now\u2019: Pamela Adlon in Better Things with Celia Imrie as her mother.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph:  BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Adlon is such a nurturer that by the end of our conversation, when she\u2019s introduced me to her assistant Ryan, and we\u2019ve had a chat about his life, and how seeing Adlon run her own show while also looking after her daughters made him call his own mother more, and Adlon has introduced me to her writers, including Patricia Resnick (\u201cShe wrote <em>9 to 5</em>!\u201d she yells, proudly), I find myself asking her how she stays so hopeful in a world that seems to discourage it at every turn. I want to know how she finds the flower in the turd. She falls back into her chair. \u201cRyan told me about how this one organisation has figured out a way to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. And I was like, \u2018Well I was reading about how these teenagers figured out how to break down styrofoam.\u2019 So it\u2019s these little things. These little things! And you know, my kids are so aware. My youngest daughter is going to DC in December for a week with the ACLU and her platform is women\u2019s reproductive rights, and justice. My 16-year-old. It makes me wanna cry.\u201d She tears up, not for the first time; hope makes her emotional. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hope,\u201d she insists. \u201cIf humanity doesn\u2019t have hope, there\u2019s nothing to live for.\u201d She stops talking. There is a perfect pause.</p> <p>\u201cWow,\u201d she hoots. \u201cI sound like an <em>asshole</em>. Wowwww.\u201d</p> <p><em>Season two of Better Things starts on Wednesday 17 July at 10pm on BBC Two.</em></p>",

Quietly brilliant, it is an unsentimental look at family life and working single mothers \u2013 blunt, warm, fascinated by the absurdity of trying to hold it all together. Which, it turns out, is exactly what Adlon is like in real life. At times, trying to keep her on track in a conversation can be like filling a leaky bucket. \u201cThat is probably not what you asked me. I tend to go off the rails,\u201d she says at one point, segueing from a story about selling all of her possessions in her 20s to her mother being born during the Blitz. The show, which does not shy away from the difficulties of raising three young women under one roof, or looking after an elderly and increasingly dotty mother who lives next door, is often described as \u201craw\u201d. \u201cI like raw,\u201d Adlon protests. \u201cI prefer raw to \u2018brave\u2019. When people are like, \u2018You\u2019re so brave...\u2019\u201d She grabs a fistful of her legs. She has no qualms about appearing on screen in her pants. \u201cI tell my girlfriends, that\u2019s what real thighs look like. I\u2019m like: brave, bitch! So brave.\u201d Better Things is about finding the humour and the heart in divorce, death, bad decisions, in not having enough time for your kids or your work, in having to grind to get by. \u201cI think the theme throughout the show is, there\u2019s hope and there\u2019s love and there\u2019s laughter, amidst all this dark shit, you know? There\u2019s a flower growing up through a turd,\u201d she explains, succinctly. \u201cI like to feel hope, and I like to laugh at things that are dark. You need somebody in your life, if you\u2019re having the worst possible fucking day, to laugh at you. To point at you and say, \u2018Oh bro, that\u2019s hysterical.\u2019\u201d In the past, Adlon has called Better Things \u201csemi-autobiographical\u201d. Today she is measured about the similarities between the show and her life. \u201cWell, I have three daughters, I\u2019m a single mom, I have an English mother, I\u2019m an actor,\u201d she shrugs \u2013 but she also admits that she has spent her whole life watching, writing things down, gathering material to use. Her eccentric English mother, played by Celia Imrie, loves being written into the series. \u201cBecause when I tell her, \u2018Mom, you\u2019re being extra sassy right now,\u2019 she says, \u2018You love it! You get more material for your show.\u2019\u201d She nods. \u201cI can\u2019t argue.\u201d She was at the gym with her friend recently. \u201cAnd she\u2019s literally the most miserable person in the world. She starts talking, and she\u2019s crying, and crying. And I turn to the woman next to me and I go, \u2018You know why she\u2019s crying? Cos her husband just left her. Two kids. She\u2019s almost 50.\u2019 And she\u2019s working out, and she starts laughing hysterically, through her tears. Isn\u2019t it hilarious?\u201d She laughs. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t even tell you this, because I\u2019m making it a scene in the show.\u201d Another friend told her recently that she\u2019d always assumed Adlon wasn\u2019t listening to her. \u201cAnd then she saw my show, and she said, \u2018I realise you\u2019re really listening.\u2019 I\u2019m surprised that people don\u2019t tread more lightly around me.\u201d Now 52, Adlon has been a professional actor since she was 10. She was a child star in a popular US sitcom The Facts of Life, and appeared alongside Lorna Luft and Michelle Pfeiffer as a wisecracking kid sister in Grease 2. For the most part, she says, she felt protected in those environments. But talking about those years brings back memories. There was an independent film and a scene in a swimming pool. \u201cAnd the director said, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be funny if you dropped the towel for a minute, and we saw your butt, just for a minute?\u2019 And I was 15 years old. I had to kiss a boy in that movie, too, and I hadn\u2019t done that. And I remember being really uncomfortable and feeling scared, because what are the parameters? The kid actor looked at me and said, \u2018An apple is an apple, a plum is a plum, a kiss isn\u2019t a kiss without the tongue.\u2019 And I was just gutted.\u201d It was a shock to go from being famous and on television as a kid to being in her 20s, on unemployment benefits, having to sell her possessions. The loss of her record collection, in particular, still smarts. \u201cOh! Do you have to bring that up? I\u2019m still upset. I can see the records,\u201d she says. But she realised that, with her unique smoke and honey voice, she could earn her living another way. \u201cI started hitting it in voiceover and animation,\u201d she explains, which sustained her for much of her career; her biggest voice job was as Bobby in King of the Hill. In the new season of Better Things, she has a character say, \u201cI know you were Rooster on Ching of the Mill.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s so stupid,\u201d she says. \u201cI didn\u2019t even bother making up a new title.\u201d Like Sam Fox, Adlon is a jobbing actor, and her work rate has been so prodigious that her CV has the heft of a weighty novel: \u201cNo job too big or small, is my motto, and every single job led me to where I am.\u201d She spent several years as Marcy Runkle in Californication, the explicit, hedonistic Showtime series, where she played a foul-mouthed wisecracker who regularly shot off insults like \u201cDie young and suffer, dickless.\u201d When her eldest daughter, Gideon, was starting a new school, Adlon told her: \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be people who watch the show, and it\u2019s a show for adults.\u201d She didn\u2019t want the kids to watch it just because their friend\u2019s mother was in it. \u201cBut what an innocent time that was! Because now the shit that kids watch on their phones and everything? Forget it!\u201d She remembers a parent coming up to her, with her 12-year-old and nine-year-old in tow. \u201cThey said, \u2018Oh Pamela, we watch your show, we love it.\u2019\u201d She cackles. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You\u2019re kidding?\u2019 And she said, \u2018No no, we love it.\u2019 And then her little nine-year-old was like, \u2018Yah, it\u2019s really good.\u2019 I looked at her and said: \u2018The show is not for kids.\u2019\u201d She slips into stern parent mode. \u201cI mean, how do you explain \u2018stunt cock\u2019 to your nine-year-old daughter?\u201d she says. \u201cFuckin\u2019 asshole.\u201d Around the same time as Californication, Adlon was working closely with her friend and collaborator Louis CK on his series Lucky Louie and Louie. He later returned production and writing favours on the first two seasons of Better Things. Then allegations of sexual misconduct against CK surfaced in 2017, and Adlon found herself caught in the crossfire, her own show hanging in the balance through its association with him. She spoke about how \u201cdevastating\u201d it was in an interview with the New Yorker, but the only condition of this conversation was that we wouldn\u2019t bring him up today. One of the more peculiar aspects of the #MeToo groundswell has been women being asked to answer for men\u2019s transgressions; it seems reasonable to not ask her to do so again. Besides, Better Things did not exactly sink without CK, who was not involved in season three. When Adlon took sole charge, critics praised it for finding its voice and a new sense of invention. Adlon is a single mother; she got married in the mid-90s, and divorced a decade ago. Her ex-husband, the father of her kids, moved to Europe. \u201cI don\u2019t talk about him,\u201d she says, in a rare closed moment, though she leans into the screen, and adds: \u201cReally not convenient for drop-offs on the weekend, and stuff like that.\u201d She always knew that she had Better Things in her, but it took her years to feel ready to go ahead and make it, in part because she was raising three young children alone. \u201cI had to say no to a lot of things, because I did not want to take on more than I could handle,\u201d she says. The final push came when she was working on a big budget, big network television show \u2013 she won\u2019t tell me the name of it, but will say, \u201cIt was fuckin\u2019 awful, a circling-the-drain, terrible, American television show\u201d \u2013 and a Friday turned into a Saturday, and it was midnight, and they still hadn\u2019t finished half of what they were supposed to. \u201cIce water went through my veins and it was like, \u2018Don\u2019t these people have families? What the fuck are they doing?\u2019 That was the moment that I thought, I\u2019m ready. I\u2019m ready to do this.\u201d Her three daughters, now 21, 18 and 16, are \u201cincredibly proud\u201d of her. \u201cThey see their mom being a boss and running a show, and hiring a ton of people, and how important this job is to so many people. It\u2019s absolutely an unbelievable situation. To see their mom really make it big when she hit 50, after kind of just middling the line for so long...\u201d This seems to go against the traditional Hollywood narrative, that women have an expiration date. \u201cI think it\u2019s still true, but it\u2019s less true,\u201d Adlon says. \u201cI think that if you can make yourself viable, anything is possible.\u201d She does, however, think she should have started directing sooner. \u201cI wish I hadn\u2019t just stayed in one lane for so long. That bothers me, that I was myopic in that way. Now I have six jobs, and I wish that I had kind of committed to doing that, instead of, oh, I only act.\u201d Still, she is a firm believer in everything happening for a reason. There is an earth mother warmth to Adlon, and it\u2019s not just the sage, or the crying room. She has taken her own industry experiences and used them to ensure that the patterns are not repeated. \u201cAll of those things really helped me,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo for example, when I did Californication, there were so many young women who came on the show, and they had to do nudity, or do a simulated sex scene, or make out. And so I just made it my mission to try and soothe people and talk them through it and say, don\u2019t do anything you don\u2019t feel comfortable with, or don\u2019t be ashamed, or love your body now, but don\u2019t ever get pushed into doing something you don\u2019t want to do.\u201d The number one priority on Better Things, she says, is that \u201cI would never ask somebody to do something that I wouldn\u2019t do myself, and that they wouldn\u2019t feel safe or comfortable doing.\u201d Adlon is such a nurturer that by the end of our conversation, when she\u2019s introduced me to her assistant Ryan, and we\u2019ve had a chat about his life, and how seeing Adlon run her own show while also looking after her daughters made him call his own mother more, and Adlon has introduced me to her writers, including Patricia Resnick (\u201cShe wrote 9 to 5!\u201d she yells, proudly), I find myself asking her how she stays so hopeful in a world that seems to discourage it at every turn. I want to know how she finds the flower in the turd. She falls back into her chair. \u201cRyan told me about how this one organisation has figured out a way to pull carbon out of the atmosphere. And I was like, \u2018Well I was reading about how these teenagers figured out how to break down styrofoam.\u2019 So it\u2019s these little things. These little things! And you know, my kids are so aware. My youngest daughter is going to DC in December for a week with the ACLU and her platform is women\u2019s reproductive rights, and justice. My 16-year-old. It makes me wanna cry.\u201d She tears up, not for the first time; hope makes her emotional. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have hope,\u201d she insists. \u201cIf humanity doesn\u2019t have hope, there\u2019s nothing to live for.\u201d She stops talking. There is a perfect pause. \u201cWow,\u201d she hoots. \u201cI sound like an asshole. Wowwww.\u201d Season two of Better Things starts on Wednesday 17 July at 10pm on BBC Two.",

He ran Canada\u2019s central bank before his arrival in Threadneedle Street in 2013. He has chaired the Financial Stability Board, the body set up by the G20 to oversee reforms of the global banking system after the near meltdown of 2008. He has been at the forefront of international moves to prepare the financial system for climate-related risks. Philip Hammond says that when Carney speaks at international meetings the other participants put down their smart phones and listen, a courtesy offered to only an elite few.</p> \n<p>But none of that might matter, because Carney is Canadian. That\u2019s relevant because under a stitch-up that dates back to the creation of the post-war financial global organisations 75 years ago, a European runs the IMF and an American holds the reins at the World Bank. Carney holds British and Irish passports, and has some influential friends in Europe \u2013 Mario Draghi at the ECB for one \u2013 but will struggle to make the case that he is European rather than Canadian.</p> \n<p>It goes without saying that none of this should have any bearing on who succeeds Lagarde. The right way to appoint a new managing director of the IMF would be to decide what the organisation is actually for and then choose the most suitable person to run it, regardless of their place of birth or their nationality.</p> \n<p>For the Fund this means three three things: to return it to its original mission of helping countries out of balance of payments troubles without crippling them with austerity; to help countries meet the 2020 UN sustainable development goals; and to meet the challenge of global heating.</p> \n<p>Over the years, and particularly since countries such as China, India and Brazil have become important sources of growth, the US-Europe \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d has looked more and more of an anachronism. In 1980, global economic output was split 60-40% in favour of advanced western economies. Today, it is the other way round.</p> \n<p>But when the US citizen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/07/jim-yong-kim-to-resign-as-president-of-the-world-bank\">Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly resigned as president of the World Bank</a> earlier this year, it came as absolutely no surprise that the Europeans left it to the White House to appoint a successor. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/09/new-world-bank-chief-confirms-commitment-to-environment\">rubber-stamping David Malpass</a> for the Bank, the Europeans will expect a quid pro quo from the US when it comes to the IMF.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2019/jul/04/george-osborne-imf-job-christine-lagarde-stock-markets-economy-business-live\">Labour sounds alarm over George Osborne's ambitions to run IMF - business live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The process for filling the top jobs at both organisations is supposed to be open, transparent and merit-based, but the advanced nations continue to have a stranglehold on the Bretton Woods organisations. Despite the warm words, everybody knows that Lagarde\u2019s successor will be a European. That\u2019s why Carney wouldn\u2019t have a prayer without a British or Irish passport, and it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/04/george-osborne-aiming-for-new-role-as-head-of-imf\">why George Osborne, was quick to register an interest</a>.</p> \n<p>Osborne would be a terrible choice for the IMF. He showed no interest in the organisation when he was chancellor other than to seek support in Washington for his austerity programme at home. But he knows how the process works. A successful candidate needs to get the backing of their own government and also be well thought of by other countries. The former chancellor will have done his prospects no harm by backing Boris Johnson to be prime minister and has reminded the Europeans that he was quick to back Lagarde when she became IMF\u2019s managing director in 2011. Nor, given the European Commission\u2019s obsession with budgetary orthodoxy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/04/george-osborne-ambitions-over-imf-top-job-prompt-criticism\">will austerity count necessarily against him.</a></p> \n<p>Even so, the portents for Carney or Osborne getting the IMF gig are not great. Britain has a poor track record when it comes to grabbing the top international jobs; there has never been a Briton heading the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the World Trade Organisation. As for the IMF, of the 11 managing directors, one has been a Belgian, one a Dutchman, one a German, one a Spaniard, and two have been Swedes. The remaining five have been French, including the last two.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Emmanuel Macron will no doubt be telling fellow EU leaders that Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, has what it takes to replace Lagarde but they think it is time for another country to have a turn.

She is Bulgarian; she is a former vice president of the European commission; she is number two to Malpass at the World Bank and knows how the Bretton Woods institutions work.

      "bodyText": "Ever since he set his departure date from the Bank of England, there has been speculation about what Mark Carney will do next. There are not that many bigger jobs around than his current one but one of them has become available after the news of Christine Lagarde\u2019s planned departure from the International Monetary Fund for the European Central Bank. Carney would certainly like a move to Washington, not least because the other job he has had his eye on \u2013 prime minister of Canada \u2013 is currently occupied by Justin Trudeau. Asked at a Bank press conference whether he is interested, Carney replied he had lots of admiration for Lagarde and that the proper processes should be followed. What he pointedly didn\u2019t say was \u201cno\u201d. Carney is qualified to run the IMF. He ran Canada\u2019s central bank before his arrival in Threadneedle Street in 2013. He has chaired the Financial Stability Board, the body set up by the G20 to oversee reforms of the global banking system after the near meltdown of 2008. He has been at the forefront of international moves to prepare the financial system for climate-related risks. Philip Hammond says that when Carney speaks at international meetings the other participants put down their smart phones and listen, a courtesy offered to only an elite few. But none of that might matter, because Carney is Canadian. That\u2019s relevant because under a stitch-up that dates back to the creation of the post-war financial global organisations 75 years ago, a European runs the IMF and an American holds the reins at the World Bank. Carney holds British and Irish passports, and has some influential friends in Europe \u2013 Mario Draghi at the ECB for one \u2013 but will struggle to make the case that he is European rather than Canadian. It goes without saying that none of this should have any bearing on who succeeds Lagarde. The right way to appoint a new managing director of the IMF would be to decide what the organisation is actually for and then choose the most suitable person to run it, regardless of their place of birth or their nationality. For the Fund this means three three things: to return it to its original mission of helping countries out of balance of payments troubles without crippling them with austerity; to help countries meet the 2020 UN sustainable development goals; and to meet the challenge of global heating. Over the years, and particularly since countries such as China, India and Brazil have become important sources of growth, the US-Europe \u201cgentleman\u2019s agreement\u201d has looked more and more of an anachronism. In 1980, global economic output was split 60-40% in favour of advanced western economies. Today, it is the other way round. But when the US citizen Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly resigned as president of the World Bank earlier this year, it came as absolutely no surprise that the Europeans left it to the White House to appoint a successor. After rubber-stamping David Malpass for the Bank, the Europeans will expect a quid pro quo from the US when it comes to the IMF. The process for filling the top jobs at both organisations is supposed to be open, transparent and merit-based, but the advanced nations continue to have a stranglehold on the Bretton Woods organisations. Despite the warm words, everybody knows that Lagarde\u2019s successor will be a European. That\u2019s why Carney wouldn\u2019t have a prayer without a British or Irish passport, and it is why George Osborne, was quick to register an interest. Osborne would be a terrible choice for the IMF. He showed no interest in the organisation when he was chancellor other than to seek support in Washington for his austerity programme at home. But he knows how the process works. A successful candidate needs to get the backing of their own government and also be well thought of by other countries. The former chancellor will have done his prospects no harm by backing Boris Johnson to be prime minister and has reminded the Europeans that he was quick to back Lagarde when she became IMF\u2019s managing director in 2011. Nor, given the European Commission\u2019s obsession with budgetary orthodoxy, will austerity count necessarily against him. Even so, the portents for Carney or Osborne getting the IMF gig are not great. Britain has a poor track record when it comes to grabbing the top international jobs; there has never been a Briton heading the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development or the World Trade Organisation. As for the IMF, of the 11 managing directors, one has been a Belgian, one a Dutchman, one a German, one a Spaniard, and two have been Swedes. The remaining five have been French, including the last two. Emmanuel Macron will no doubt be telling fellow EU leaders that Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs, has what it takes to replace Lagarde but they think it is time for another country to have a turn. In only 12 of the past 56 years has a French man or woman not run the IMF. The recent horse-trading for the top EU jobs resulted in Germany getting the presidency of the European commission and France getting the plum post at the ECB. Spain and Belgium got the other two jobs up for grabs, which meant there was nothing for eastern Europe. The signs are good, therefore, for Kristalina Georgieva. She is Bulgarian; she is a former vice president of the European commission; she is number two to Malpass at the World Bank and knows how the Bretton Woods institutions work. And she is good at her job. If it is to be a European, Georgieva ticks a lot of boxes.",

But there\u2019s little in tonight\u2019s show to suggest the rarefied life multimillionaire Seinfeld must lead. His modern-life-is-funny gags are hard-wired to be relatable, from the routine about all-you-can-eat buffets to the number addressing the cult of \u201chydration\u201d.

Because nothing tonight suggests that, even at 65, Seinfeld\u2019s appetite for talking \u2013 far less his aptitude \u2013 is remotely on the wane.</p> <p><br></p>",

The opening sequence is a belter, as Seinfeld anatomises the night-out experience. Why are we here? Why is he? This is a \u201cbogus, hyped-up, not necessary special event\u201d designed to pass the time and make us feel our lives are great. But then \u2013 next gag \u2013 \u201c\u2018sucks\u2019 and \u2018great\u2019 are pretty close\u201d, says Jerry, and isn\u2019t everything a bit rubbish anyway? It\u2019s a deft start, narrowing the gap between megastar and audience, then stretching it again as comedy requires. But there\u2019s little in tonight\u2019s show to suggest the rarefied life multimillionaire Seinfeld must lead. His modern-life-is-funny gags are hard-wired to be relatable, from the routine about all-you-can-eat buffets to the number addressing the cult of \u201chydration\u201d. Each is drolly brought to life as our host role plays gluttonous overeaters or energy-drink junkies exhaustedly craving a fix. Perhaps because what Seinfeld is saying is often trivial, attention strays to how he\u2019s saying it \u2013 with a sense of rhythm and cadence so finely tuned it could be applied to almost anything and still make you laugh. You might doubt there\u2019s more humour to be wrung from that hoary standup subject, mobile phones. But Jerry manages it, with a routine looking at the anthropology of Uber, and wondering (as he did about dog ownership many moons ago) whether nowadays the human owns the phone, or vice versa. As per his wonderfully withering gag about the vapid phrase \u201cit is what it is\u201d, the material zeroes in on how ridiculous we all are. But it also advertises senior citizen Seinfeld\u2019s increasing detachment from the whole rigmarole. In the only section he couldn\u2019t have delivered any earlier in his career, he celebrates life as a sexagenarian, when you can say no to everything with impunity, and anticipates his next decade, when \u2013 why bother speaking? \u2013 a dismissive wave should suffice. It\u2019s a lovely joke, but an unlikely scenario. Because nothing tonight suggests that, even at 65, Seinfeld\u2019s appetite for talking \u2013 far less his aptitude \u2013 is remotely on the wane.",

It\u2019s often described as in between ras el hanout and garam masala, which is how I think of Somali food: in between Arabic and Indian, with African thrown in. When you make it, it will come as no surprise to know Somalia was called \u201cRegio Aromatica\u201d, or the aromatic isles, by the ancient Romans.</p> <p>Xawaash is made family to family, so my mum\u2019s is the one I make, although she sometimes adds turmeric to hers. You adapt it depending on what you have, but I\u2019ve got a consistent recipe that reminds me of her cooking.</p> <p>My idea of home is tied in with my mum\u2019s cooking. I was born in Kuwait. My mum was probably born in Ethiopia; she was a nomadic herder. My dad is from the city, from Hargeisa in Somaliland. They moved to Kuwait, had children and then they separated and we came to London in 1985. Civil unrest had been rumbling in Somaliland, so we didn\u2019t go back. Mum wanted her daughters to be educated, and Somali culture can be sexist, although it also celebrates strong women. I named my supper club after Arawelo, a fearsome Somali queen who led a women\u2019s army. </p> <p>We lived in Harlesden, in north-west London, which had Caribbean and African shops. But Mum would also take two buses to get spices and things like fresh tamarind from the Indian shops on Ealing Road. I used to help her out in the kitchen when I was young but was rubbish at it. I felt that girls were expected to help with cooking but boys weren\u2019t, so that pissed me off. When I left London I missed her food, so had to learn it for myself. </p> <p>Ful \u2013 we call it maraq digir \u2013 is a great way to feed a big family. Beans are cheap, and the xawaash is a good way of adding lots of flavour. People know about ful medames from Egypt, but the dish goes all the way down east Africa to Sudan. We would have that for brunch on Saturday, made with tinned adzuki beans, fried onions and lots of green chillies, fresh coriander, fresh tomatoes \u2013 and the xaawash spice mix. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Mum had to take two buses to get all the spices for this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When my mum had less money she would get bones with tiny bits of meat left on. She was feeding so many \u2013 she\u2019d make enough for 20 people a day. Us and our friends who\u2019d be round, or people from the Somali community. </p> <p>We didn\u2019t eat much English food, and of course I wanted fish and chips and pizza. Now I appreciate it all. My mum taught us to have a palate. If I go into a fancy restaurant, I don\u2019t have to like it. Not because I grew up poor, Somali or as a refugee, or because I don\u2019t understand western flavours. I just might not like it. But if you\u2019re outside that world you can feel uncomfortable trusting your own judgment. It sometimes feels like the food world is for a particular class, a particular place, a particular kind of person who is a \u201cfoodie\u201d. Everyone eats food, so I don\u2019t know what defines a foodie. My mum is an amazing chef. She\u2019s illiterate, she grew up as a nomadic herder, but has an instinctive way of making food that is good and tasty. <strong>HO\u2019N</strong></p> <h2>Maraq digir <em><strong>Somali bean stew</strong></em></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeec00cc3e2ef9c2936f4965f89e1110df816a93\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aeec00cc3e2ef9c2936f4965f89e1110df816a93/145_394_7676_4606/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Somalia Bean Stew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Serves 2 as a main or </strong></em><em><strong>4 as a starter</strong></em><br><strong>fresh coriander</strong> 1 bunch<br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 3 medium<br><strong>green chillies</strong> 1-2 <br><strong>ginger</strong> \u00bd thumb (optional)<br><strong>dried adzuki beans</strong> 200g <br><strong>onion</strong> 1, peeled and sliced<br><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br><strong>xawaash spice blend</strong> 1 dsp (see below)<br><strong>tomato paste</strong> 1 level dsp, or to taste<br><strong>salt</strong> to taste</p> <p><em><strong>For the xawaash </strong></em><em><strong>spice mix (makes about 35g</strong></em><em><strong> or 4 heaped d</strong></em><em><strong>sp)</strong></em><br><strong>cumin seeds</strong> 2 dsp<br><strong>coriander seeds</strong> 2 dsp <br><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 1 dsp <br><strong>flat cinnamon bark</strong> 2cm piece<br><strong>cardamom seeds</strong> 1 tsp <br><strong>whole cloves</strong> 1 tsp</p> <p>To make the xawaash, dry heat all the spices in a frying pan on a medium heat for about 2 minutes or until they begin to give off a lovely warm aroma.

I always loved seafood, and this dish was my favourite. My mum or grandma prepared it on special occasions and it represents flavours from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.</p> <p>When I was growing up in Mexico City, living by the coast was the dream. In the late 1990s, places opened in Mexico City that evoked the <em>marisquer\u00edas</em>, the seafood restaurants of Veracruz, which is the state where <em>arroz a la tumbada</em> comes from. They weren\u2019t glamorous but 20 years ago they were cool. They were neighbourhood places where the seafood was amazing and brought in from the coast. There is one called <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/tale-two-kitchens-gabriela-camara-contramar-cala-documentary-netflix\" title=\"\">Contramar</a> that\u2019s still going, and is one of my favourite places. We\u2019d go a lot, for the food, and the <em>son jarocho</em>, the music of Veracruz. Without travelling, I could be taken to the coast. It doesn\u2019t matter where I am, arroz a la tumbada will send me to Mexico and give me that feeling of being happy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It doesn't matter where I am, this is the dish that sends me to Mexico</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a lot of Spanish influences in our cuisine, so this is a paella adapted to Mexico. There are no rules for the seafood you use, as long as there\u2019s a combination. Like lots of Mexican dishes, it\u2019s created so people can adapt to what\u2019s around. White fish, clams, crab, prawns \u2013 whatever you have is what\u2019s perfect. Now that I live in London, I add fennel and dill. In Mexico we use parsley, coriander, Mexican oregano and <em>epazote</em>, a very aromatic herb that\u2019s difficult to find here. Instead of long-grain rice I use arborio, which I think makes more sense, being closer to the Mediterranean. </p> <p>I feel very grateful that I\u2019ve had many homes. My wife Natalie is half-Mexican and half-English, she was born and raised and studied in the UK. When I go away, I miss London. But I still sometimes miss Mexico, and it\u2019s mainly because of the food. Tacos and tequila are easy to get now, but the flavour that always lifts me out of homesickness is smoky chillies. If I feel homesick I can now get or make the food I want. At the beginning when I moved here I couldn\u2019t say this, but London is home. <strong>HO\u2019N</strong></p> <h2>Chipotle tumbada-style <strong>(Rice with haddock and prawns)</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"33468af65a72e4c760db75b6bc2c60e0598558e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33468af65a72e4c760db75b6bc2c60e0598558e7/387_336_7575_4545/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chipotle tumbada-style\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Serves 4-5 </strong></em><br><em><strong>For the rice</strong></em><br><strong>rapeseed oil</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>unsalted </strong><strong>clarified butter or ghee</strong> 6 tbsp <br><strong>haddock</strong> 600g, skinless and sliced in thick chunks<br><strong>king prawns</strong> 500g, shell on, cleaned and deveined <br><strong>fennel</strong> 1 bulb, finely sliced<br><strong>arborio rice</strong> 500g<br><strong>tomato and chipotle recaudo</strong> 350ml (see below)<br><strong>fish or vegetable stock</strong> 900ml, or half fish stock and half water</p> <p><em><strong>To garnish</strong></em><br><strong>lemons</strong> juice of 2 <br><strong>dill leaves</strong> a handful <br><strong>mint leaves</strong> a handful <br><strong>flat-leaf parsley</strong> a small bunch<br><strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> 100g</p> <p><em><strong>For the tomato and chipotle recaudo</strong></em><br><strong>beefsteak tomatoes</strong> 2, halved <br><strong>vine tomatoes </strong>3 <br><strong>white onion</strong> \u00bd, roughly chopped <br><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br><strong>rapeseed oil</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>dried <a href=\"https://www.mexgrocer.co.uk/Chipotle-Morita-Chilli-Dried-40gr.html\" title=\"\">chipotle chillies</a></strong> 2-3 (available online)<br><strong>water</strong> optional<br><strong>salt</strong> 1 tsp, optional</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6.</p> <p>Start by making the tomato and chipotle recaudo. Recaudo in Mexico is a special blend of spices, herbs and chillies, and like many dishes in Mexican cuisine, it is the secret of our <em>abuelitas</em>, our grandmothers.</p> <p>Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic on an oven tray, drizzle with rapeseed oil and bake in the oven for about 25 minutes.</p> <p>I recommend using a variety of good quality tomatoes; seasonal local tomatoes during the summer in the UK are amazing, such as those from the Isle of Wight.</p> <p>While the tomatoes are in the oven, place the dried chipotle chillies in a small bowl, cover with boiling water and rest until they become soft. Once softened, remove the seeds. Reserve the soaking water.</p> <p>Take the tomatoes out of the oven and pour them with the juices into a blender, add the soft chipotle chillies, the salt and a little of the soaking water, if necessary, and blend to a very smooth paste. Set aside.</p> <p>For the rice, in a paella-like pan heat a tablespoon of the rapeseed oil and 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the fish and prawns, season with a bit of salt and sear them until they get some colour on each side. It\u2019s important to use a really hot pan and not to overcook them. Remove them from the pan and set aside.</p> <p>In the same pan add the remaining oil and butter and the sliced fennel, and fry slowly until it softens and caramelises.</p> <p>Add the rice and keep stirring. Once it is lightly fried, pour in the tomato-chipotle recaudo, add the stock a little at a time and stir frequently until the rice is fully cooked.</p> <p>Three-quarters of the way through adding the liquid, and just before the rice absorbs all of it, add the seared prawns and fish and let them cook through. The rice should be al dente. Season with salt and coarse black pepper to taste.</p> <p>Finish by generously squeezing the lemon juice over and add fresh dill leaves, a few sprigs of mint and parsley, and the tomatoes. Serve warm, making sure everybody gets some of the fish and prawns, as well as the fresh herbs and tomatoes. Enjoy with your family and pair it with a crisp, fresh lager or glass of wine. <br><em><a href=\"https://www.santoremedio.co.uk/\" title=\"\">santoremedio.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>Sri Owen<strong> <br></strong><em><strong>Cookery writer</strong></em></h2> <p>The recipe for my grandmother\u2019s omelette reminds me of West Sumatra, where I was born, and my first seven years living there with her. She did all of the cooking. My parents were teachers and they worked every day, so my grandmother gave us all breakfast. Sometimes she would make this omelette. We were an extended, multi-generational family living in one house, so there might have been my young uncle or cousin having breakfast with us. It is quite a filling omelette, so we could choose to have rice porridge or this, but some of my boy cousins might have both! Or, we might take it for lunch with rice.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e6ad11218b8df71ff004b32bce72c5e9a55fa011\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6ad11218b8df71ff004b32bce72c5e9a55fa011/1553_852_2854_3566/800.jpg\" alt=\"Sri Owen.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sri Owen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Omelettes are quite universal. I debated when I wrote this recipe whether its origin is Chinese or Dutch. Probably in my household it would be the influence of the Dutch. Both my parents were educated in Dutch schools. My grandmother never went to school \u2013 she was rich enough to have teachers at home \u2013 but I am not sure where she learned to make this omelette. You never know with Indonesia. When I started to write my cookbook I didn\u2019t know the origin of quite a lot of Indonesian food. Some seems to have come from the Arab countries, through India. A lot of our curries are Indian, and our snacks are very similar to Middle Eastern snacks like borek and falafel. With the Dutch we started making cake, and before the Dutch arrived we had influence from the Chinese. Fried rice was originally Chinese but now it\u2019s famous as Indonesian nasi goreng.</p> <p>After my husband Roger and I got married in Indonesia we came to live in the UK. My children were born here, and this is very much my home. When I moved to the UK, I had to make adjustments to my cooking. I first came here in 1964, and from then until 1969 we did our shopping in Holland. Indonesian food was already being imported there but not to the UK. So I travelled a lot to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or the Hague. We\u2019d go with empty cars and come back with the boots full. And there were quite a lot of Indonesian restaurants to visit; there were only two in London.</p> <p>I never really got homesick for Indonesian food, because I\u2019d cook it myself. I could never recommend Indonesian restaurants in London, so whenever friends asked, \u201cWhere is the good Indonesian restaurant?\u201d I\u2019d say: \u201cIt\u2019s here, in my home.\u201d When I was writing books \u2013 I\u2019ve written 15 \u2013 I\u2019d give parties as a way of recipe-testing. It was a good excuse to do both. I\u2019d put it in my household budget: my party, an anniversary, Roger\u2019s birthday, or just a party for wanting to give a party. You can\u2019t eat everything yourself.</p> <p>I\u2019m now staying in a care home. I\u2019m not quite settled yet. I have a two-bedroom apartment, but hardly any kitchen. I can still cook for the two of us, me and Roger, and I can still give parties. And I can still make my grandmother\u2019s omelette. I don\u2019t think I put enough garlic in my recipe, so when I make it now for myself, I put a lot of coconut, and a lot of garlic and spring onions so it\u2019s garlicky and oniony as well. I\u2019m very fond of my grandmother and her food makes me feel at home. It gives me comfort, a feeling of, \u201cthis is what I\u2019m used to\u201d. HON</p> <h2>Telur dadar padang <br><strong>My grandmother\u2019s omelette</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6eb82c4817f72da4433b542f174e52c3ae7b6295\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6eb82c4817f72da4433b542f174e52c3ae7b6295/261_423_7201_4320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Telur dadar padang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is one of my grandmother\u2019s treats for breakfast. It looks like a cake, and to make the omelette thick she used freshly grated coconut, grated potato or sweet potato. And she would add a dollop of her <em>sambal lado</em> to spice it up. I use <em>sambal ulek</em> when I make this omelette at home. It is made by crushing fresh red chillies with a little salt, using a mortar and pestle. It is available ready-made from Asian food stores and <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/ecom/products/cooks-ingredients-sambal-oelek-paste/692409-672769-672770\" title=\"\">supermarkets</a>.</p> <p>If you want coconut but can\u2019t use fresh, you can use desiccated coconut. It\u2019s a bit sweeter and drier, so you need to soak it for a few minutes and include a little of the liquid.</p> <p><em><strong>Serves 4 for breakfast or as a light lunch with some salad</strong></em><br><strong>shallots</strong> 2, finely sliced<br><strong>garlic </strong>1 clove, finely sliced<br><strong>sambal ulek</strong> 1 tsp or \u00bd tsp chilli powder<br><strong>freshly grated coconut or grated potato or sweet potato</strong> 100g<br><strong>salt</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>milk or cold water</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>duck eggs</strong> 6<br><strong>peanut (groundnut) oil </strong>2 tbsp</p> <p>Mix together all the ingredients, except the eggs and oil, in a large bowl. Then beat the mixture thoroughly with the eggs \u2013 it needs more beating than an ordinary omelette and should be quite fluffy.</p> <p>Heat the oil in a wok until hot. (I find a 25cm non-stick frying pan an easier alternative to a wok.) Carefully spoon the oil over the sides, or tilt and turn the wok or pan so the sides are well coated with oil. Pour the omelette mixture into the hot wok or pan, and while it is still liquid swirl it around so that the omelette is not too thick in the centre. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn it over carefully (it should be perfectly circular), and cook slowly for another 3-4 minutes until the middle, which of course is still the thickest part, is firm and the whole omelette is lightly browned. The edges should now be delicately crisp.</p> <p>Serve hot or cold, cut up into slices like a cake.</p> <p><em>From Indonesian Food by Sri Owen (Pavilion Books, \u00a320).

I was born upstairs and lived there for the first few years of my life. Even after we moved out, the restaurant remained the centre of our universe. My dad worked there, and during Christmas or Easter, when the restaurant was shut, everyone would congregate there to celebrate. It was a proper Cypriot taverna with tablecloths and plastic strip curtains. My grandmother would make stuffed vine leaves from scratch for the mezze. And, of course, it had grills where they cooked steaks, chops and souvlakia.</p> <p>That smell of meat over coals is so evocative but when my grandparents shut the restaurant in the mid-90s it disappeared from my life. Around that time, I became vegetarian. My dad had also given up meat and my mum didn\u2019t eat much of it. But when I started working in food in my early 20s, I began eating meat again. One day, during a shoot for a Jamie Oliver book in Athens, someone was cooking souvlakia on the grills and it was like a slap around the face. Never before had a smell conjured up such strong images and emotions. It was like I was back in my grandparents\u2019 restaurant.</p> <p>My grandparents on both sides moved to England in search of a better quality of life and better opportunities. My mum\u2019s dad was an orphan and so poor that the people in his village outside Nicosia would feed him and give him shoes. When he got married to my granny, they moved to England and he got a job in a Wall\u2019s sausage factory. The manager of the factory lent him the money to open up his first deli in Holloway, and he went from nothing to owning a few shops and houses around London. My dad\u2019s parents moved over a bit later. Before they opened the restaurant, my granddad was a barber and my grandma a seamstress. They\u2019re both still alive. My gran is 79 now and she still cooks for our entire family twice a week. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Never before had a smell conjured up such strong emotions in me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My sister and I helped out at the restaurant, but mostly we got in the way. My gran would get us to fill the salt and pepper shakers, or pod peas and broad beans. Food was the centre of our world. It took me a while to realise that, actually, not all 19-year-olds read cookery books all the time or spend three hours making moussaka on a Saturday night when their friends are out getting drunk.</p> <p>My mum made a lot of Cypriot food at home. Any occasion was a feast. Now I\u2019ve taken over that role. For Greek Easter this year, I had everyone round to mine and spent two days making <em>flaounes</em>, the traditional Cypriot Easter pastries, as taught to me by my gran. I love that I\u2019ll be able to pass these traditions on to my daughter, Persephone \u2013 she has no choice!</p> <p>Not only do I want to document my family\u2019s recipes, I also want to preserve a sense of our culture and traditions. In my generation, out of all my cousins, only one other person is interested in food. When my grandma finally passes away, who else is going to keep all these food traditions going?Home means lots of noise and chatter, and it always revolves around cooking. As a housewarming present , my dad bought me my own <em>foukou</em>, the motorised grill used for cooking souvlakia. It\u2019s my pride and joy, and that smell is just amazing. It\u2019s my childhood, it\u2019s my grandparents\u2019 restaurant. <strong>KF</strong></p> <h2><strong>Herby pork souvlaki with mustard sauce</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8dd1354e42f0d63fe8e4cae7ebadce61fcbef52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8dd1354e42f0d63fe8e4cae7ebadce61fcbef52/337_344_7253_4352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Herby pork souvlaki with mustard sauce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em><strong>Serves 4</strong></em><br><strong>pork tenderloins</strong> 2, around 400g each<br><strong>rosemary</strong> a few sprigs <br><strong>thyme</strong> 1\u20442 a bunch <br><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves<br><strong>olive oil</strong> 100ml <br><strong>red wine vinegar</strong> 1 tbsp</p> <p><em><strong>For the mustard sauce</strong></em><br><strong>Greek yog</strong><strong>urt</strong> 125g <br><strong>mayonnaise</strong> 3 tbsp <br><strong>honey</strong> 1 tbsp <br><strong>English mustard</strong> 1-2 tbsp</p> <p><em><strong>To serve</strong></em><br><strong>tomatoes</strong> 3 <br><strong>red onion</strong> 1 <br><strong>lemon</strong> 1 <br><strong>flat-leaf parsley</strong> a few sprigs <br><strong>pita breads</strong> 4 \u00d7 round, fluffy <br><strong>sweet smoked paprika</strong> a pinch <br><strong>tzatziki</strong> (see below)<br><strong>chips</strong> (see below, if you want to make your own)</p> <p>Cut the pork into even 2-3cm chunks and place in a mixing bowl.

But now that I live in California, it\u2019s much easier. In Oakland, where I live with my husband, Michael, all the focal points in our back garden are citrus trees \u2013 we\u2019ve got makrut lime, bearss lime and the tiny Mexican key lime. I make a point of using limes in my recipes. In India, it\u2019s the citrus you use when you want to add acid to a dish. And in a cobbler \u2013 a southern American dish I learned from my mother-in-law in Virginia \u2013 lime makes perfect sense with blueberry and ginger as a way of amplifying the flavour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ef48a0974d825f3f44fd2fa76a1d8cdd4a817ac7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef48a0974d825f3f44fd2fa76a1d8cdd4a817ac7/733_898_3646_4557/800.jpg\" alt=\"Nik Sharma\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nik Sharma.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saroyan Humphrey/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The food I grew up with in Bombay was not very connected. My mother is Catholic and her family comes from Goa, whereas my dad is Hindu from Uttar Pradesh, so her cuisine was more tropical and heavy on coconut, meat and seafood, while his was more vegetarian. Most Indian kids I know were rooted in a single culinary region, but I never had that. I think it makes it easier for me now, as a food writer, because I never worry about things needing to be done in a certain way.</p> <p>My biggest influence was my grandmother on my mother\u2019s side. She showed me a lot of techniques \u2013 teaching me to cut vegetables to the same size when making a stock, for example, so everything cooks in a uniform way.</p> <p>I started cooking aged 10 or 11 because I was sick of eating what they were serving at home. But there was an experimental side to it as well. It made me very curious and I\u2019d wonder what would happen if, say, I used vinegar instead of lime. Around that time, I found out that I was gay. I was scared to live in India because I\u2019d heard my parents talking about gay people getting arrested, so I wanted to move to a safer place, and my only way out was through science \u2013 chemistry and biology were my strong points. In 2002, I got a scholarship to a college in Cincinnati to study molecular genetics. Six months after moving to America, I came out.</p> <p>A lot of my classmates asked me for Indian food, but after a while I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to cook food that reflected my present as well as my past \u2013 and I started writing about this in my blog A Brown Table.</p> <p>California definitely feels like home now. But after 17 years away, does Bombay still feel like home? That\u2019s a hard question. For 12 years I didn\u2019t go back at all. Going to Bombay with my husband Michael for the first time was stressful, at least to begin with, because it brought back all those memories of why I left. I knew my family was fine with me being gay but there were friends and relatives who didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t want to hide anything, but thankfully we were there for a wedding and we got completely absorbed in it. The next time there was no wedding, and that was more challenging, but by then India was becoming much more vocal about gay rights, which made things a little easier.</p> <p>India has changed so much. The first week I\u2019m there is fine, but after that I start to feel like I\u2019m out of place. I feel like I\u2019m a stranger in India. That\u2019s when I realise America is more my home now. <strong>KF</strong></p> <h2>Blueberry, ginger, and lime cobbler</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6c99d3a8567d69a5323003b1ad105517726f0457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c99d3a8567d69a5323003b1ad105517726f0457/70_289_7066_4240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blueberry, ginger, and lime cobbler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><br><em><strong>Serves 6</strong></em><br><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 115g, chilled and cubed plus extra to grease the dish<br><strong>blueberries </strong>600g, fresh or frozen <br><strong>crystallised ginger </strong>50g, chopped<br><strong>jaggery or brown sugar </strong>50g<br><strong>lime</strong> zest and juice of 1 <br><strong>corn</strong><strong>flour</strong> 2 tbsp<br><strong>fine sea salt</strong> \u00bd tsp<br><strong>plain flour</strong> 280g<br><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br><strong>baking powder</strong> 2 tsp<br><strong>whole milk</strong> 240ml</p> <p>Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4.

      "bodyText": "Fozia Ismail Founder, Arawelo Eats, Bristol The key to Somali cooking is xawaash spice mix \u2013 translated it means \u201cthe essentials\u201d. It\u2019s often described as in between ras el hanout and garam masala, which is how I think of Somali food: in between Arabic and Indian, with African thrown in. When you make it, it will come as no surprise to know Somalia was called \u201cRegio Aromatica\u201d, or the aromatic isles, by the ancient Romans. Xawaash is made family to family, so my mum\u2019s is the one I make, although she sometimes adds turmeric to hers. You adapt it depending on what you have, but I\u2019ve got a consistent recipe that reminds me of her cooking. My idea of home is tied in with my mum\u2019s cooking. I was born in Kuwait. My mum was probably born in Ethiopia; she was a nomadic herder. My dad is from the city, from Hargeisa in Somaliland. They moved to Kuwait, had children and then they separated and we came to London in 1985. Civil unrest had been rumbling in Somaliland, so we didn\u2019t go back. Mum wanted her daughters to be educated, and Somali culture can be sexist, although it also celebrates strong women. I named my supper club after Arawelo, a fearsome Somali queen who led a women\u2019s army. We lived in Harlesden, in north-west London, which had Caribbean and African shops. But Mum would also take two buses to get spices and things like fresh tamarind from the Indian shops on Ealing Road. I used to help her out in the kitchen when I was young but was rubbish at it. I felt that girls were expected to help with cooking but boys weren\u2019t, so that pissed me off. When I left London I missed her food, so had to learn it for myself. Ful \u2013 we call it maraq digir \u2013 is a great way to feed a big family. Beans are cheap, and the xawaash is a good way of adding lots of flavour. People know about ful medames from Egypt, but the dish goes all the way down east Africa to Sudan. We would have that for brunch on Saturday, made with tinned adzuki beans, fried onions and lots of green chillies, fresh coriander, fresh tomatoes \u2013 and the xaawash spice mix. When my mum had less money she would get bones with tiny bits of meat left on. She was feeding so many \u2013 she\u2019d make enough for 20 people a day. Us and our friends who\u2019d be round, or people from the Somali community. We didn\u2019t eat much English food, and of course I wanted fish and chips and pizza. Now I appreciate it all. My mum taught us to have a palate. If I go into a fancy restaurant, I don\u2019t have to like it. Not because I grew up poor, Somali or as a refugee, or because I don\u2019t understand western flavours. I just might not like it. But if you\u2019re outside that world you can feel uncomfortable trusting your own judgment. It sometimes feels like the food world is for a particular class, a particular place, a particular kind of person who is a \u201cfoodie\u201d. Everyone eats food, so I don\u2019t know what defines a foodie. My mum is an amazing chef. She\u2019s illiterate, she grew up as a nomadic herder, but has an instinctive way of making food that is good and tasty. HO\u2019N Maraq digir Somali bean stew Serves 2 as a main or 4 as a starter fresh coriander 1 bunch tomatoes 3 medium green chillies 1-2 ginger \u00bd thumb (optional) dried adzuki beans 200g onion 1, peeled and sliced olive oil 1 tbsp xawaash spice blend 1 dsp (see below) tomato paste 1 level dsp, or to taste salt to taste For the xawaash spice mix (makes about 35g or 4 heaped dsp) cumin seeds 2 dsp coriander seeds 2 dsp black peppercorns 1 dsp flat cinnamon bark 2cm piece cardamom seeds 1 tsp whole cloves 1 tsp To make the xawaash, dry heat all the spices in a frying pan on a medium heat for about 2 minutes or until they begin to give off a lovely warm aroma. Once you can smell this, take it off the heat. Use a coffee grinder or pestle and mortar to grind everything down to a powder. If you want to make a big batch, just double the quantities, and it should last in an airtight container in the dark for up to 3 weeks. It can last longer, but the potency deteriorates \u2013 I use a lot of xawaash, so I get through it quickly. To make the maraq digir, whizz up the coriander, tomatoes and chillies in a blender. Sometimes I add fresh ginger to give it an extra boost. Put the mixture to one side. In a saucepan, boil the adzuki beans for about 20 minutes. (You can also use tinned fava beans.) Fry the sliced onion slowly in the olive oil until slightly caramelised. Stir in the xawaash spice blend. Fry a little longer, then add the coriander and tomato mixture, with some tomato paste. Add salt to taste. Leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, adding a little water if needed. Add the beans and cook for another 15-20 minutes, then mash some of the beans. I like it with feta and black olives and lots of olive oil on top. Serve with pita or naan bread, za\u2019atar and olive oil. Arawelo Eats supper club in aid of the Leading Lights youth charity is on 27 July; araweloeats.com Edson Diaz-Fuentes Co-owner, Santo Remedio, London Ever since I was little, I\u2019ve craved new flavours. I always loved seafood, and this dish was my favourite. My mum or grandma prepared it on special occasions and it represents flavours from the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. When I was growing up in Mexico City, living by the coast was the dream. In the late 1990s, places opened in Mexico City that evoked the marisquer\u00edas, the seafood restaurants of Veracruz, which is the state where arroz a la tumbada comes from. They weren\u2019t glamorous but 20 years ago they were cool. They were neighbourhood places where the seafood was amazing and brought in from the coast. There is one called Contramar that\u2019s still going, and is one of my favourite places. We\u2019d go a lot, for the food, and the son jarocho, the music of Veracruz. Without travelling, I could be taken to the coast. It doesn\u2019t matter where I am, arroz a la tumbada will send me to Mexico and give me that feeling of being happy. There\u2019s a lot of Spanish influences in our cuisine, so this is a paella adapted to Mexico. There are no rules for the seafood you use, as long as there\u2019s a combination. Like lots of Mexican dishes, it\u2019s created so people can adapt to what\u2019s around. White fish, clams, crab, prawns \u2013 whatever you have is what\u2019s perfect. Now that I live in London, I add fennel and dill. In Mexico we use parsley, coriander, Mexican oregano and epazote, a very aromatic herb that\u2019s difficult to find here. Instead of long-grain rice I use arborio, which I think makes more sense, being closer to the Mediterranean. I feel very grateful that I\u2019ve had many homes. My wife Natalie is half-Mexican and half-English, she was born and raised and studied in the UK. When I go away, I miss London. But I still sometimes miss Mexico, and it\u2019s mainly because of the food. Tacos and tequila are easy to get now, but the flavour that always lifts me out of homesickness is smoky chillies. If I feel homesick I can now get or make the food I want. At the beginning when I moved here I couldn\u2019t say this, but London is home. HO\u2019N Chipotle tumbada-style (Rice with haddock and prawns) Serves 4-5 For the rice rapeseed oil 3 tbsp unsalted clarified butter or ghee 6 tbsp haddock 600g, skinless and sliced in thick chunks king prawns 500g, shell on, cleaned and deveined fennel 1 bulb, finely sliced arborio rice 500g tomato and chipotle recaudo 350ml (see below) fish or vegetable stock 900ml, or half fish stock and half water To garnish lemons juice of 2 dill leaves a handful mint leaves a handful flat-leaf parsley a small bunch cherry tomatoes 100g For the tomato and chipotle recaudo beefsteak tomatoes 2, halved vine tomatoes 3 white onion \u00bd, roughly chopped garlic 4 cloves rapeseed oil 1 tbsp dried chipotle chillies 2-3 (available online) water optional salt 1 tsp, optional Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Start by making the tomato and chipotle recaudo. Recaudo in Mexico is a special blend of spices, herbs and chillies, and like many dishes in Mexican cuisine, it is the secret of our abuelitas, our grandmothers. Place the tomatoes, onion and garlic on an oven tray, drizzle with rapeseed oil and bake in the oven for about 25 minutes. I recommend using a variety of good quality tomatoes; seasonal local tomatoes during the summer in the UK are amazing, such as those from the Isle of Wight. While the tomatoes are in the oven, place the dried chipotle chillies in a small bowl, cover with boiling water and rest until they become soft. Once softened, remove the seeds. Reserve the soaking water. Take the tomatoes out of the oven and pour them with the juices into a blender, add the soft chipotle chillies, the salt and a little of the soaking water, if necessary, and blend to a very smooth paste. Set aside. For the rice, in a paella-like pan heat a tablespoon of the rapeseed oil and 3 tablespoons of the butter. Add the fish and prawns, season with a bit of salt and sear them until they get some colour on each side. It\u2019s important to use a really hot pan and not to overcook them. Remove them from the pan and set aside. In the same pan add the remaining oil and butter and the sliced fennel, and fry slowly until it softens and caramelises. Add the rice and keep stirring. Once it is lightly fried, pour in the tomato-chipotle recaudo, add the stock a little at a time and stir frequently until the rice is fully cooked. Three-quarters of the way through adding the liquid, and just before the rice absorbs all of it, add the seared prawns and fish and let them cook through. The rice should be al dente. Season with salt and coarse black pepper to taste. Finish by generously squeezing the lemon juice over and add fresh dill leaves, a few sprigs of mint and parsley, and the tomatoes. Serve warm, making sure everybody gets some of the fish and prawns, as well as the fresh herbs and tomatoes. Enjoy with your family and pair it with a crisp, fresh lager or glass of wine. santoremedio.co.uk Sri Owen Cookery writer The recipe for my grandmother\u2019s omelette reminds me of West Sumatra, where I was born, and my first seven years living there with her. She did all of the cooking. My parents were teachers and they worked every day, so my grandmother gave us all breakfast. Sometimes she would make this omelette. We were an extended, multi-generational family living in one house, so there might have been my young uncle or cousin having breakfast with us. It is quite a filling omelette, so we could choose to have rice porridge or this, but some of my boy cousins might have both! Or, we might take it for lunch with rice. Omelettes are quite universal. I debated when I wrote this recipe whether its origin is Chinese or Dutch. Probably in my household it would be the influence of the Dutch. Both my parents were educated in Dutch schools. My grandmother never went to school \u2013 she was rich enough to have teachers at home \u2013 but I am not sure where she learned to make this omelette. You never know with Indonesia. When I started to write my cookbook I didn\u2019t know the origin of quite a lot of Indonesian food. Some seems to have come from the Arab countries, through India. A lot of our curries are Indian, and our snacks are very similar to Middle Eastern snacks like borek and falafel. With the Dutch we started making cake, and before the Dutch arrived we had influence from the Chinese. Fried rice was originally Chinese but now it\u2019s famous as Indonesian nasi goreng. After my husband Roger and I got married in Indonesia we came to live in the UK. My children were born here, and this is very much my home. When I moved to the UK, I had to make adjustments to my cooking. I first came here in 1964, and from then until 1969 we did our shopping in Holland. Indonesian food was already being imported there but not to the UK. So I travelled a lot to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or the Hague. We\u2019d go with empty cars and come back with the boots full. And there were quite a lot of Indonesian restaurants to visit; there were only two in London. I never really got homesick for Indonesian food, because I\u2019d cook it myself. I could never recommend Indonesian restaurants in London, so whenever friends asked, \u201cWhere is the good Indonesian restaurant?\u201d I\u2019d say: \u201cIt\u2019s here, in my home.\u201d When I was writing books \u2013 I\u2019ve written 15 \u2013 I\u2019d give parties as a way of recipe-testing. It was a good excuse to do both. I\u2019d put it in my household budget: my party, an anniversary, Roger\u2019s birthday, or just a party for wanting to give a party. You can\u2019t eat everything yourself. I\u2019m now staying in a care home. I\u2019m not quite settled yet. I have a two-bedroom apartment, but hardly any kitchen. I can still cook for the two of us, me and Roger, and I can still give parties. And I can still make my grandmother\u2019s omelette. I don\u2019t think I put enough garlic in my recipe, so when I make it now for myself, I put a lot of coconut, and a lot of garlic and spring onions so it\u2019s garlicky and oniony as well. I\u2019m very fond of my grandmother and her food makes me feel at home. It gives me comfort, a feeling of, \u201cthis is what I\u2019m used to\u201d. HON Telur dadar padang My grandmother\u2019s omelette This is one of my grandmother\u2019s treats for breakfast. It looks like a cake, and to make the omelette thick she used freshly grated coconut, grated potato or sweet potato. And she would add a dollop of her sambal lado to spice it up. I use sambal ulek when I make this omelette at home. It is made by crushing fresh red chillies with a little salt, using a mortar and pestle. It is available ready-made from Asian food stores and supermarkets. If you want coconut but can\u2019t use fresh, you can use desiccated coconut. It\u2019s a bit sweeter and drier, so you need to soak it for a few minutes and include a little of the liquid. Serves 4 for breakfast or as a light lunch with some salad shallots 2, finely sliced garlic 1 clove, finely sliced sambal ulek 1 tsp or \u00bd tsp chilli powder freshly grated coconut or grated potato or sweet potato 100g salt \u00bd tsp milk or cold water 1 tbsp duck eggs 6 peanut (groundnut) oil 2 tbsp Mix together all the ingredients, except the eggs and oil, in a large bowl. Then beat the mixture thoroughly with the eggs \u2013 it needs more beating than an ordinary omelette and should be quite fluffy. Heat the oil in a wok until hot. (I find a 25cm non-stick frying pan an easier alternative to a wok.) Carefully spoon the oil over the sides, or tilt and turn the wok or pan so the sides are well coated with oil. Pour the omelette mixture into the hot wok or pan, and while it is still liquid swirl it around so that the omelette is not too thick in the centre. Let it cook for 2-3 minutes. Turn it over carefully (it should be perfectly circular), and cook slowly for another 3-4 minutes until the middle, which of course is still the thickest part, is firm and the whole omelette is lightly browned. The edges should now be delicately crisp. Serve hot or cold, cut up into slices like a cake. From Indonesian Food by Sri Owen (Pavilion Books, \u00a320). To buy a copy for \u00a317.60, go to guardianbookshop.com Georgina Hayden Cookery writer Until I was 13 or 14, my grandparents owned a Greek-Cypriot restaurant called Dirlandas in Tufnell Park, north London. I was born upstairs and lived there for the first few years of my life. Even after we moved out, the restaurant remained the centre of our universe. My dad worked there, and during Christmas or Easter, when the restaurant was shut, everyone would congregate there to celebrate. It was a proper Cypriot taverna with tablecloths and plastic strip curtains. My grandmother would make stuffed vine leaves from scratch for the mezze. And, of course, it had grills where they cooked steaks, chops and souvlakia. That smell of meat over coals is so evocative but when my grandparents shut the restaurant in the mid-90s it disappeared from my life. Around that time, I became vegetarian. My dad had also given up meat and my mum didn\u2019t eat much of it. But when I started working in food in my early 20s, I began eating meat again. One day, during a shoot for a Jamie Oliver book in Athens, someone was cooking souvlakia on the grills and it was like a slap around the face. Never before had a smell conjured up such strong images and emotions. It was like I was back in my grandparents\u2019 restaurant. My grandparents on both sides moved to England in search of a better quality of life and better opportunities. My mum\u2019s dad was an orphan and so poor that the people in his village outside Nicosia would feed him and give him shoes. When he got married to my granny, they moved to England and he got a job in a Wall\u2019s sausage factory. The manager of the factory lent him the money to open up his first deli in Holloway, and he went from nothing to owning a few shops and houses around London. My dad\u2019s parents moved over a bit later. Before they opened the restaurant, my granddad was a barber and my grandma a seamstress. They\u2019re both still alive. My gran is 79 now and she still cooks for our entire family twice a week. My sister and I helped out at the restaurant, but mostly we got in the way. My gran would get us to fill the salt and pepper shakers, or pod peas and broad beans. Food was the centre of our world. It took me a while to realise that, actually, not all 19-year-olds read cookery books all the time or spend three hours making moussaka on a Saturday night when their friends are out getting drunk. My mum made a lot of Cypriot food at home. Any occasion was a feast. Now I\u2019ve taken over that role. For Greek Easter this year, I had everyone round to mine and spent two days making flaounes, the traditional Cypriot Easter pastries, as taught to me by my gran. I love that I\u2019ll be able to pass these traditions on to my daughter, Persephone \u2013 she has no choice! Not only do I want to document my family\u2019s recipes, I also want to preserve a sense of our culture and traditions. In my generation, out of all my cousins, only one other person is interested in food. When my grandma finally passes away, who else is going to keep all these food traditions going?Home means lots of noise and chatter, and it always revolves around cooking. As a housewarming present , my dad bought me my own foukou, the motorised grill used for cooking souvlakia. It\u2019s my pride and joy, and that smell is just amazing. It\u2019s my childhood, it\u2019s my grandparents\u2019 restaurant. KF Herby pork souvlaki with mustard sauce Serves 4 pork tenderloins 2, around 400g each rosemary a few sprigs thyme 1\u20442 a bunch garlic 2 cloves olive oil 100ml red wine vinegar 1 tbsp For the mustard sauce Greek yogurt 125g mayonnaise 3 tbsp honey 1 tbsp English mustard 1-2 tbsp To serve tomatoes 3 red onion 1 lemon 1 flat-leaf parsley a few sprigs pita breads 4 \u00d7 round, fluffy sweet smoked paprika a pinch tzatziki (see below) chips (see below, if you want to make your own) Cut the pork into even 2-3cm chunks and place in a mixing bowl. Pick and finely chop the rosemary and thyme leaves and add to the pork. Peel and finely grate in the garlic. Season well, then stir in the olive oil and red wine vinegar and cover. Refrigerate and leave to marinate for at least half an hour, longer if possible. If using wooden skewers be sure to soak them in water first to stop them burning. If you are making chips (see below), get them on the go now.Get the sides ready. To make the mustard sauce, mix together the yogurt, mayonnaise, honey and mustard to taste. Season to taste, cover and set aside till needed. Chop the tomatoes and peel and finely slice the onion. Mix them together in a bowl and squeeze over the juice of the lemon. Finely chop the parsley and scatter over the top. Set aside until needed. When you are ready to cook, preheat a griddle pan to a high heat (or get your barbecue going). Thread 4 large skewers (or 8 small ones) with the marinated pork, being careful not to push the pieces too close together, so that they cook thoroughly all the way through. Cook the meat on the hot griddle pan for around 10-12 minutes, turning evenly, until they are charred and cooked through. Warm the pita breads on the side of the griddle or barbecue for a few minutes at the end. Serve everything together and let everyone build their own kebabs \u2013 but be sure to finish with a sprinkle of paprika. Talattouri \u2013 Mama\u2019s tzatziki The cucumber is salted and drained, a small step but a key one, as it gives you an intensely creamy dip \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be at all runny. Serves 4-6 cucumber 1 sea salt and freshly ground black pepper garlic 1 small clove dried mint 1 tsp Greek yogurt 500g extra virgin olive oil lemon \u00bd Start by draining the cucumber. Trim it and coarsely grate it into a mixing bowl. Mix in 1 teaspoon of flaky sea salt (if using fine sea salt, use \u00bd teaspoon), then spoon it into a clean, fine sieve. Leave it to drain over the mixing bowl for 1 hour, stirring occasionally to remove all the liquid. When it is ready, spoon it into a larger mixing bowl. Finely grate in the peeled garlic clove and add the dried mint and a good pinch of ground black pepper. Spoon the yogurt into the fine sieve. You don\u2019t want to press it through, just to remove any excess liquid. When it\u2019s drained, spoon it into the bowl with the grated cucumber, drizzle in 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil, squeeze in a little lemon juice to taste and mix everything together well. Serve finished with a little drizzle of oil on top and sprinkled with a little extra dried mint. Homemade oven chips This only makes a small quantity, enough for a few chips in the kebabs. If you want more, to eat alongside your meal, then double or triple the quantity. Serves 4 potatoes 600g Maris Piperor King Edwards work best olive oil sea salt Preheat your oven to 230C/gas mark 8. Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Cut the potatoes into chips, around 1cm in thickness. Cook for 2 minutes in the boiling water, then drain in a colander and steam-dry over the hot pan. Place the chips in a large roasting tray, drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt. Use your hands to toss everything together, making sure that every piece of potato is coated in seasoned oil. Place in the oven for around 35-40 minutes, turning the chips halfway through, until cooked through, golden and crisp all over. From Taverna: Recipes From a Cypriot Kitchen by Georgina Hayden (Square Peg, \u00a325). To buy a copy for \u00a322, go to guardianbookshop.com Nik Sharma Cookery writer When I was a kid in Bombay, I tried growing a lime tree in a pot on a windowsill at home and it didn\u2019t work out too well, yielding only one fruit. But now that I live in California, it\u2019s much easier. In Oakland, where I live with my husband, Michael, all the focal points in our back garden are citrus trees \u2013 we\u2019ve got makrut lime, bearss lime and the tiny Mexican key lime. I make a point of using limes in my recipes. In India, it\u2019s the citrus you use when you want to add acid to a dish. And in a cobbler \u2013 a southern American dish I learned from my mother-in-law in Virginia \u2013 lime makes perfect sense with blueberry and ginger as a way of amplifying the flavour. The food I grew up with in Bombay was not very connected. My mother is Catholic and her family comes from Goa, whereas my dad is Hindu from Uttar Pradesh, so her cuisine was more tropical and heavy on coconut, meat and seafood, while his was more vegetarian. Most Indian kids I know were rooted in a single culinary region, but I never had that. I think it makes it easier for me now, as a food writer, because I never worry about things needing to be done in a certain way. My biggest influence was my grandmother on my mother\u2019s side. She showed me a lot of techniques \u2013 teaching me to cut vegetables to the same size when making a stock, for example, so everything cooks in a uniform way. I started cooking aged 10 or 11 because I was sick of eating what they were serving at home. But there was an experimental side to it as well. It made me very curious and I\u2019d wonder what would happen if, say, I used vinegar instead of lime. Around that time, I found out that I was gay. I was scared to live in India because I\u2019d heard my parents talking about gay people getting arrested, so I wanted to move to a safer place, and my only way out was through science \u2013 chemistry and biology were my strong points. In 2002, I got a scholarship to a college in Cincinnati to study molecular genetics. Six months after moving to America, I came out. A lot of my classmates asked me for Indian food, but after a while I wanted to do things differently. I wanted to cook food that reflected my present as well as my past \u2013 and I started writing about this in my blog A Brown Table. California definitely feels like home now. But after 17 years away, does Bombay still feel like home? That\u2019s a hard question. For 12 years I didn\u2019t go back at all. Going to Bombay with my husband Michael for the first time was stressful, at least to begin with, because it brought back all those memories of why I left. I knew my family was fine with me being gay but there were friends and relatives who didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t want to hide anything, but thankfully we were there for a wedding and we got completely absorbed in it. The next time there was no wedding, and that was more challenging, but by then India was becoming much more vocal about gay rights, which made things a little easier. India has changed so much. The first week I\u2019m there is fine, but after that I start to feel like I\u2019m out of place. I feel like I\u2019m a stranger in India. That\u2019s when I realise America is more my home now. KF Blueberry, ginger, and lime cobbler Serves 6 unsalted butter 115g, chilled and cubed plus extra to grease the dish blueberries 600g, fresh or frozen crystallised ginger 50g, chopped jaggery or brown sugar 50g lime zest and juice of 1 cornflour 2 tbsp fine sea salt \u00bd tsp plain flour 280g sugar 2 tbsp baking powder 2 tsp whole milk 240ml Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Lightly grease a 20 x 28cm rectangular baking dish with a little butter, add the blueberries, ginger, jaggery, lime zest and juice, cornstarch and \u00bc teaspoon of the salt. Fold to coat evenly. In a large mixing bowl, dry whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder and the remaining salt. Add the cubed butter and mix by hand until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the milk until just combined. Scoop the batter over the top of the blueberries with a teaspoon, covering as much fruit as possible. Place the baking dish on a baking sheet and bake in the preheated oven for 55 to 60 minutes, until the juices are bubbling and the crust is golden brown. Remove the baking dish from the oven and allow to cool for at least 10 minutes before serving. Serve with a scoop of a good vanilla or cardamom ice-cream.

Sam planned to be a teacher until he did an actual teaching module.

There wasn\u2019t a clear plan for what came next. Perhaps a wine shop or bakery, even making cheese, but ideally less all-consuming than a restaurant where you are always under pressure to perform, always one bad review away from a plunge in reputation. It wasn\u2019t a long-term option for a healthy and happy life.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"947c73b1cad5360f03e8980ee5f010d032dc7ea7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/947c73b1cad5360f03e8980ee5f010d032dc7ea7/0_0_6582_3949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"x\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Beccy picking sweet peas.</p></li> </ul> <p>Wandering around their plot in late June, the healthy happiness shines.

      "bodyText": "Wilding Farm Whitchurch, Bristol Supplies restaurants including Tare, Box-E, Dela and Root, all in Bristol You might be forgiven for thinking there is a restlessness about the careers of Sam and Beccy Leach. Sam planned to be a teacher until he did an actual teaching module. He trained as a butcher and a baker, before becoming an accomplished cook, with stints in London at St John and 40 Maltby St. He and Beccy ran Birch in Bristol garnering cult status and rave reviews from the likes of Marina O\u2019Loughlin before walking away, keeping only the restaurant\u2019s vegetable garden and branching out into Somerset cider. Said garden is now geared to producing food for some of Bristol\u2019s more interesting places. Harry Baker crab apples, Globe artichokes. Rob Howell at Root is a long-time Leach fan: \u201cFor the first time in my career I can actually say we work the menu around the produce,\u201d he says. \u201cDoing it justice is the main thing. The only downside is that sometimes you can create a special dish but due to seasonality and availability we have to take it off the menu.\u201d The Leaches always intended a shortish life for Birch. \u201cWe always saw it as something to run for a limited time,\u201d says Sam, \u201cbefore thinking about children and moving to the countryside. There wasn\u2019t a clear plan for what came next. Perhaps a wine shop or bakery, even making cheese, but ideally less all-consuming than a restaurant where you are always under pressure to perform, always one bad review away from a plunge in reputation. It wasn\u2019t a long-term option for a healthy and happy life.\u201d Beccy picking sweet peas. Wandering around their plot in late June, the healthy happiness shines. The plan for children and moving to the country is near fruition. Beccy is seven months\u2019 pregnant and they are weeks away from a move into Somerset with a cottage, more land and their own cider orchard. \u201cThe more I got into food, the more interested I was in production,\u201d says Sam. \u201cThe where and how, what varieties, what soil type. And once we started making cider as a hobby, it seemed the obvious thing to pursue next. All of the orchards are there, crying out for attention and available for rent.\u201d Cooking just-dug Nicola potatoes; Early Nantes carrots The two arms of the business complement each other with harvests following on. \u201cVegetable-growing fits well alongside cider-making in the flow of the seasons,\u201d says Sam. \u201cIt is something we both love to do. The garden was originally a way to provide things we couldn\u2019t buy locally for the restaurant. The gaps in availability are still there and there are now many more good restaurants in Bristol.\u201d The couple\u2019s growing philosophy, like their cooking, is deceptively simple. \u201cBroadly speaking, we grow organically, though we aren\u2019t certified. We don\u2019t spray or use anything other than compost and organic seeds, though we are saving more of our own seed now. We have aphids but also lots of predatory insects. We have pigeons but also sparrowhawks. We have slugs but lots of slow worms and frogs.\u201d Dinner in the garden. We end our visit drinking Wilding cider, sitting at the plot while Sam and Beccy cook over a small outdoor stove. Perfect boiled potatoes, just lifted; fresh-picked Oskar peas, Early Nantes carrots, crisp salad leaves and porky sausages from their own pigs. As the sun sets and the starlings chatter, it is easy to see why they quit the stress of restaurants and why their growing is in demand. AJ Instagram: @wildingcider Ryewater Nursery Sherborne, Dorset Supplies and consults for restaurants including Kiln and Smoking Goat, the Begging Bowl, Som Saa and Ikoyi, all in London Luke Farrell in the greenhouse. When Luke Farrell started growing Thai herbs at Ryewater Nursery, the only chef he was interested in supplying was himself. After working in south-east Asia, he became \u201caddicted to herbs and chillies\u201d, and returned to the UK about 15 years ago with a suitcase of plants and seeds. Luckily, his father, lepidopterist Clive Farrell, had greenhouses at the family home in Dorset. \u201cThe climate was already set up in there,\u201d says Farrell, \u201cso I stuffed in my plants and hoped for the best.\u201d He took a box of his herbs to David Thompson at his Michelin-starred Thai restaurant Nahm. Thompson\u2019s response? \u201c\u2018We need more.\u2019 It all spiralled from there.\u201d Clockwise from top left: Thai green papayas, trumpet vine, Thai \u2018prik yuak\u2019 chillies, a Chinese painted quail, which eats insects in the greenhouses. Farrell now has three tropical greenhouses, complete with a custom jungle soil mix, rain systems and underfloor heating. Inside, he grows gingers and galangals, herbs, papayas, bananas and types of gourds which have leaves and flowers that can be used in soups. \u201cIt\u2019s a good one to have because it doesn\u2019t travel well from Thailand, the leaves will have turned black,\u201d Farrell explains. By 2014, the Begging Bowl, Smoking Goat and Som Saa had opened in London, and Farrell\u2019s operation became more like a business \u2013 although, even at capacity, he can\u2019t always meet the increasing demand. \u201cI just sent 24kg of green papayas to Som Saa. They\u2019ve cleared me out.\u201d Most of his work is as a consultant. At Kiln\u2019s request, he has just sent three lemongrass plants to another of their suppliers to grow for the restaurant. Recently, he\u2019s been researching west African chillies for London restaurant Ikoyi: \u201cThere\u2019s one that looks like a scotch bonnet but tastes of apricot, absolutely no heat in it.\u201d A postman butterfly on porterweed. In the cooler months, Farrell puts the greenhouses to sleep and travels to south-east Asia. If what he brings back is a success, he sends samples to kitchens. \u201cI tell them what they want,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of backwards.\u201d Some things never make it to restaurants. He won\u2019t be sharing the long peppers, used in lots of stir-fries, or the few keffir limes he grows: \u201cFor me they\u2019re like truffles.\u201d Thai herbs This summer, Farrell will be back behind the stove to cook a series of lunches in the greenhouses. There will be Dorset seafood and locally reared meat, but the rest of the menu is up to the garden. \u201cI might want to cook one thing but the herbs will suggest something different,\u201d he explains. \u201cThey say, \u2018Look, we\u2019re ready!

      "body": "<h2>Simon Bonwick</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef-owner, the Crown, Burchetts Green, Berkshire</strong></em></p> <p>Back when I started as a chef, I saw someone flitting, like a shadow, down the long back corridor from the kitchen. It scared me right up to my tonsils. I discovered a man who was very fatigued, scuffed, and sunburnt. He looked very down on his luck. In a posh voice he asked: \u201cCan I have a drink and something to eat?\u201d I took his stinking coat, hung it up, helped him into a lovely white starched coat and trilby I had spare, then filled him up with grub. The poor bugger asked my name while I put loads of biscuits in his pockets before he left. Thirty years later, after the Crown won a Michelin star, a very smart couple started coming in, then one Friday they left a letter in an envelope under a napkin, which began: \u201cYou\u2019ll not remember me, but you were the young chef with a Ready Brek smile who helped me out when I was at a real low point.\u201d Beside the letter, there was his gift of a very generous cheque.</p> <p>I\u2019m very appreciative of most people, even the couple I kept finding in our laundry room, having sex.</p> <h2>Gary Usher</h2> <p><em><strong>Executive chef,</strong></em><em><strong> Sticky Walnut, Chester, and Burnt Truffle, Heswall, Wirral</strong></em></p> <p>I was at another restaurant of mine but got a call saying that Jay Rayner had just walked into Burnt Truffle. I jumped in my Tesla and drove over as fast as I could. I missed his starters but I managed to cook his main course and desserts. Afterwards, a customer, a very smartly dressed woman, came up and said: \u201cI don\u2019t know who panicked more \u2013 you or me. Rayner was with a female friend and I went to the ladies\u2019 room before my lunch and someone had made a mess in there. I was so worried the woman would have informed Rayner and you\u2019d get a bad review that I hunted for the toilet cleaner, the brush and everything and cleaned your toilets.\u201d She made me realise that I had an amazing following.</p> <p>Then there was the guy who wanted to bring his own cake in. I said that if he consumed it on the premises there\u2019d be a charge, like with wine. The charge is for the knife, the plates, the time, the electricity and not selling a cake. He got annoyed with me and then rang up the next day to repeat how annoyed he still was. I repeated our policy and said I\u2019d not got much more to say about it. He kept phoning, then said he wanted to meet me at an industrial park in Chester for a fight.</p> <h2>James Lewis</h2> <p><em><strong>Director and head of front-of-house, Gauthier, Soho</strong></em></p> <p>We have a wealthy gentleman who comes here with his girlfriend whenever he stays at the Ritz. He books a private dining room and uses the florist from the Dorchester to decorate it, vividly, like a lush greenhouse. The chef prepares a special meal, he always has caviar and tips generously. It\u2019s quite a performance. When he departs, he likes to pop a \u00a320 note in the top pockets of staff members and I\u2019ve seen him doing that to a random customer walking past reception.</p> <p>One gentleman \u2013 who\u2019s not Asian \u2013 eats everything with chopsticks. Various condiments \u2013 sliced ginger, a lemon and a bottle of tabasco sauce \u2013 must be on the table when he arrives. He never reads the menu \u2013 a chef must discuss and adapt his meal for him and he must have his wines served literally in mouthfuls, as he likes every sip to be like his last.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There was a homeless woman who came in, ordered three lovely courses with wines, then did a runner</p> <footer> <cite>Rose Ashby, Spring</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There\u2019s a woman who wants to be moved halfway through every meal and her reasoning is that the people on the next table are too loud, although she\u2019s the loudest customer I\u2019ve ever heard.</p> <p>One gentleman won\u2019t sit with the bust of Napoleon, which, as a French restaurant, we place on each table. He wants a bust of Mussolini, which we keep in the cupboard for when he visits. He may be taking the mickey out of our Napoleons.</p> <h2>Stephen Terry</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef-owner, the Hardwick, Abergavenny</strong></em></p> <p>Many of the most outrageous things happened back at Harvey\u2019s [Marco Pierre White\u2019s restaurant in Wandsworth]. In the days when you had to lug quite a big phone around if it was mobile, a customer said he wanted to use the restaurant\u2019s phone in reception and was a bit rude. Marco \u2013 who\u2019s very much into his Ps and Qs and politeness \u2013 was sat on one of his tub chairs out there and refused. The customer tried to throw a punch and a fight broke out. I heard Marco call \u201cGorrrr-dunn!\u201d and Ramsay raced out of the kitchen. People were flying over tables. It was like something out of a western.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70b1ca0cac6b928c772effaf3d98da1ab31056af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70b1ca0cac6b928c772effaf3d98da1ab31056af/0_0_1146_1241/923.jpg\" alt=\"Chefs On Customers illustrations Observer Food Monthly OFM July 2019\" width=\"923\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Andi Oliver</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef, judge on The Great British Menu and presenter of Beat The Chef</strong></em></p> <p>There was one diner who was convinced her sea trout was salmon, despite being shown the packaging, and started stomping up and down shouting: \u201cThis is salmon, this is salmon!\u201d And once I had a vegan in who didn\u2019t like vegetables. It was Mother\u2019s Day and she was making such a fuss. I said: \u201cRight, what do you want me to feed you?\u201d Her mother and brother whispered to me: \u201cThank you so much for coping with her.\u201d Finally I got her to eat a bit of gravy and a few peas, then made her a roasted plantain which she ate a bit of, and then she left saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to come back all the time!\u201d I thought: \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have the energy.\u201d</p> <h2>Fred Sirieix</h2> <p><em><strong>General manager, Galvin at Windows at Park Lane Hilton and ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel on TV\u2019s First Dates</strong></em></p> <p>I remember an off-the-scale wealthy and eccentric man who\u2019d always park his Rolls outside, after arranging a certain table which had to be laid exactly to requirements. He\u2019d order everything off the menu for himself and his wife and sometimes his male lover would join them at their table, which everyone had to stand around. He was very nice though. </p> <h2>Rose Ashby</h2> <p><em><strong>Head chef, Spring, Somerset House, London</strong></em></p> <p>There was a homeless woman who came in, ordered three lovely courses, ate them very slowly with wines, then went to the toilet and did a runner. We have dinners for homeless charities and do our bit for the community, so we got over it fairly quickly.</p> <p>The other day a lady started eating our ricotta tortellini with pesto, then welled up and wept. Her friend explained that it had been like a warm ricotta hug for her. That sort of customer means a great deal. </p> <p>I have a maybe not-so-wonderful story, of a couple who dine with a puppet which the woman made, in the shape of a mole. They request a high chair and get really annoyed if one isn\u2019t spare for the puppet. They come in for the mole\u2019s birthday and always order an ice-cream with a candle in it. It might be a sad story. Why do they love that puppet so much?</p> <h2>Jeremy Lee</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef-proprietor, Quo Vadis, Soho</strong></em></p> <p>We were seconds away from serving very beautiful sirloin at an important dinner \u2013 which we\u2019d been told would be followed by speeches \u2013 and a woman got up and gave a very long speech in honour of the woman being celebrated. Then the latter spoke for 40 minutes thanking her, followed by another person who gave a very long speech about something which had been mentioned, and so on. The main course was sitting for at least an hour and a half. And yet it all went like silk \u2013 the steaks were of such quality that they benefited from it.</p> <p>A famous artist was eating a plate of the special ham we\u2019d secured from Spain, then immediately ordered another. While he awaited, a waiter cleared up another table and walked past him with two dirty plates. The artist said \u201cGive me those\u201d, grabbed them, consumed all the scraps, then said: \u201cTake these back and get me more.\u201d Other customers saw this and afterwards we did a roaring trade in bellota.</p> <h2>Shauna Guinn</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry</strong></em></p> <p>Previously I was a child protection teacher and officer. I\u2019m quite happy to hug anyone who comes in the restaurant and needs one. A woman walked in once and as soon as she opened the door, I felt just drawn to her. I gave her a big hug, I explained the menu, she had a lovely meal and five minutes after she left we received an email saying: \u201cThank you for the hug which was so appreciated. I\u2019ve been the victim of domestic violence for quite a few years and it was my birthday, but I had so much anxiety about coming out to a restaurant because I haven\u2019t been allowed out of the house for two years. I finally plucked up the courage to leave a violent person and your welcome restored my faith in humanity.\u201d That was both sad and uplifting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c20956fdfb8bf1985b9a9536cd373e1f7df38d66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c20956fdfb8bf1985b9a9536cd373e1f7df38d66/0_0_1146_1241/923.jpg\" alt=\"Chefs On Customers illustrations Observer Food Monthly OFM July 2019\" width=\"923\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Ois\u00edn Rogers</h2> <p><em><strong>Landlord, the Guinea Grill, Mayfair</strong></em></p> <p>I have wonderful, magnificent, eccentric, brilliant, loving customers. Some give me gifts like gallery prints and socks. And I have dickheaded customers too, but the regulars of any form are the lifeblood, adding colour, patina and flavour. As the landlord I\u2019ll notice regulars when they enter and I\u2019ll whisper in someone\u2019s ear: \u201cLook, you\u2019re sitting in X\u2019s chair and they\u2019ve been coming for 15 years. You weren\u2019t to know and of course you\u2019re very welcome here, but if you\u2019ll move over there, I\u2019m going to get you a pint.\u201d</p> <p>But I think a customer who molests members of staff is beyond the pale. There was an incident in which a member of staff was touched inappropriately by a customer and her response was: \u201cIf you do that to me one more time, I\u2019m going to chop your arm off!\u201d He came to me to complain, but I completely and absolutely defended her. I\u2019ve been in this business for 30 years and I recognise most people I\u2019ve barred. I remember them even more than those I haven\u2019t barred, frankly. It\u2019s a mental photofit that never fails. So, don\u2019t get barred from here.</p> <h2>Romy Gill</h2> <p><em><strong>Head chef and owner, Romy\u2019s Kitchen, Thornbury</strong></em></p> <p>I\u2019d say 97% of customers are very pleasant and I cherish the memory, for instance, of the woman who ordered a chicken makhani and was delightfully proposed to over it. The really bad customers, who I always laugh about, are a couple who came in and ordered chicken and an Indian smoky roasted aubergine, the contents and style of which were on the menu and fully explained by an intelligent and sweet waitress. When the aubergine came, the husband devoured it, but she walked up exclaiming: \u201cWhat is that?\u201d She effed and blinded and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay for this meal!\u201d They\u2019d had starters and drinks, a bottle of white and beers, and walked out without paying a thing. I was \u00a385 short. I should \u2013 or could \u2013 have phoned the police, but how then do you feed 58 other customers, while making naans, with them on the scene? Next day, the woman, as I expected, went on social media and wrote two pages about how she\u2019d been served \u201ca mash\u201d. It was laughable but pathetic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/may/19/whats-it-like-to-live-with-a-chef\">What's it like to live with a chef?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Peter Gordon</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef co-owner, Providores and Tapa Room, London</strong></em></p> <p>I once single-handedly fought off a gang of youths who\u2019d come in and then wanted to steal customers\u2019 wallets and handbags. I stormed out of the kitchen, shouted, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d and pushed them all down the stairs, where they pelted me with plants and rocks in the lobby. I was the \u201cKiwi poof\u201d who dealt with those thugs while the strong butch waiters hid upstairs.</p> <h2>Clare Smyth</h2> <p><em><strong>Chef-owner, Core, Notting Hill</strong></em></p> <p>I don\u2019t really have bad guests, but you can tell when they step in whether they\u2019re in a mood. They\u2019ve already decided they\u2019re going to be miserable and the challenge is to turn them around, to find a way past that.</p> <p>Most of my memorable guests are people in their 80s and 90s. They have a lifetime of eating and fine-dining, and make a real choice when eating out. I find them very inspiring. A lady came in once and said: \u201cI\u2019ve got cancer. But it\u2019s OK. I\u2019m going to go to Austria and I\u2019ll deal with it and then come back.\u201d And she did, on New Year\u2019s Eve, when she had a couple of bottles of wine and danced until 3am.</p>",

When the aubergine came, the husband devoured it, but she walked up exclaiming: \u201cWhat is that?\u201d She effed and blinded and said: \u201cWe don\u2019t pay for this meal!\u201d They\u2019d had starters and drinks, a bottle of white and beers, and walked out without paying a thing. I was \u00a385 short. I should \u2013 or could \u2013 have phoned the police, but how then do you feed 58 other customers, while making naans, with them on the scene? Next day, the woman, as I expected, went on social media and wrote two pages about how she\u2019d been served \u201ca mash\u201d. It was laughable but pathetic. Peter Gordon Chef co-owner, Providores and Tapa Room, London I once single-handedly fought off a gang of youths who\u2019d come in and then wanted to steal customers\u2019 wallets and handbags. I stormed out of the kitchen, shouted, \u201cWhat the fuck are you doing?\u201d and pushed them all down the stairs, where they pelted me with plants and rocks in the lobby. I was the \u201cKiwi poof\u201d who dealt with those thugs while the strong butch waiters hid upstairs. Clare Smyth Chef-owner, Core, Notting Hill I don\u2019t really have bad guests, but you can tell when they step in whether they\u2019re in a mood. They\u2019ve already decided they\u2019re going to be miserable and the challenge is to turn them around, to find a way past that. Most of my memorable guests are people in their 80s and 90s. They have a lifetime of eating and fine-dining, and make a real choice when eating out. I find them very inspiring. A lady came in once and said: \u201cI\u2019ve got cancer. But it\u2019s OK. I\u2019m going to go to Austria and I\u2019ll deal with it and then come back.\u201d And she did, on New Year\u2019s Eve, when she had a couple of bottles of wine and danced until 3am.",

The other takes a little longer as the flower is green. David eventually takes pity and points it out: a twayblade orchid, a tall spike of inconspicuous green flowers. Not all are so unobtrusive: August will bring the autumn lady\u2019s tresses orchid, for example, with spirals of white flowers on stems up to a foot long. \u201cWe\u2019ve got orchids here from April to September,\u201d David tells me, \u201cFourteen or 15 species.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t know exactly?\u201d</p> <p>He gives a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d</p> <p>We walk up a grassy dune and there, in the distance, is the Port Talbot steel works. I can read the giant Tata logo on the building. It might seem surprising that the 1,300-acre Kenfig national nature reserve, one of our most valuable patches of conservation land, is so near the industrial heart of south Wales. A bit like the British steel industry, however, this fragile wilderness is also threatened. David is himself an endangered species: there used to be five wildlife wardens here, giving guided walks, manning a handsome visitor centre, pointing out the orchids to less observant visitors like myself. Now only David and a small band of enthusiastic volunteers remain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71c257b5531e537ddd041acb5419a7ac6430b48f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71c257b5531e537ddd041acb5419a7ac6430b48f/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A common spotted orchid and other flowers on the dunes at Kenfig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A common spotted orchid and other flowers on the dunes at Kenfig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We stroll along a long, low damp area, known as a slack, and find a huge orchid nestled in a bank: the flower stalk must be 18 inches tall and on top, not yet emerged, a juicy stack of imminent flowers. \u201cOrchids hybridise like crazy,\u201d David explains. \u201cThis one has got elements of a spotted orchid and also a pyramidal. That\u2019s the problem.

Quick!\u201d We rush off to a flower-fringed area and stop. David points out a large pale bumblebee. \u201cThat\u2019s a shrill carder bee \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen one in years.\u201d</p> <p>It is, in fact, Britain\u2019s rarest bee, a creature known only from a few coastal sites in Wales and southern England. We linger a while, spotting two lizards basking on a wooden post and a pair of cuckoos who zoom briskly away.

Back in the 1990s, when David first arrived at Kenfig, there were thousands, but year by year they declined. \u201cI got quite paranoid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed like I only had to look at one and it would disappear.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"469b19df5034d6f86ba16d58c0d1ab686855a1e2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/469b19df5034d6f86ba16d58c0d1ab686855a1e2/0_222_4017_2410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kenfig lizards basking on a wooden post.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kenfig lizards basking on a wooden post.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Rushby/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By 2015 there were, he estimated, around 200 remaining \u2013 the entire British population. Then a new strategy of cutting the grass and even scraping the surface of the dune slack was begun. \u201cThe flower actually survives on shifting dune systems. It needed the disturbance.\u201d Now numbers are back to over 1,000 and Kenfig attracts botanists from all over the world, the best time to see them being in June.</p> <p>I leave the place in awe of its delicate beauty. I\u2019ve seen two species that are each rarer than the tiger or rhino and I\u2019m a mile from the M4. I want to know what other unexpected gems this area harbours.</p> <p>At the nearby seaside town of Porthcawl <a href=\"http://porthcawlbikehire.co.uk/\" title=\"\">I rent a fat bike</a> (\u00a310 per hour) and take a long, lazy ride along the sands \u2013 there are miles of them \u2013 stopping when the River Ogmore blocks my progress.

Not all are so unobtrusive: August will bring the autumn lady\u2019s tresses orchid, for example, with spirals of white flowers on stems up to a foot long. \u201cWe\u2019ve got orchids here from April to September,\u201d David tells me, \u201cFourteen or 15 species.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know exactly?\u201d He gives a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated.\u201d We walk up a grassy dune and there, in the distance, is the Port Talbot steel works. I can read the giant Tata logo on the building. It might seem surprising that the 1,300-acre Kenfig national nature reserve, one of our most valuable patches of conservation land, is so near the industrial heart of south Wales. A bit like the British steel industry, however, this fragile wilderness is also threatened. David is himself an endangered species: there used to be five wildlife wardens here, giving guided walks, manning a handsome visitor centre, pointing out the orchids to less observant visitors like myself. Now only David and a small band of enthusiastic volunteers remain. We stroll along a long, low damp area, known as a slack, and find a huge orchid nestled in a bank: the flower stalk must be 18 inches tall and on top, not yet emerged, a juicy stack of imminent flowers. \u201cOrchids hybridise like crazy,\u201d David explains. \u201cThis one has got elements of a spotted orchid and also a pyramidal. That\u2019s the problem. Some experts will split a species in two, others will lump them together.\u201d He laughs. \u201cSo we have 14 or 15.\u201d Something flies past, buzzing, and David is off up the path. \u201cGet your camera! Quick!\u201d We rush off to a flower-fringed area and stop. David points out a large pale bumblebee. \u201cThat\u2019s a shrill carder bee \u2013 I haven\u2019t seen one in years.\u201d It is, in fact, Britain\u2019s rarest bee, a creature known only from a few coastal sites in Wales and southern England. We linger a while, spotting two lizards basking on a wooden post and a pair of cuckoos who zoom briskly away. Then David decides to show me the reserve\u2019s true rarity. We head back to the slack and, next to a cane jammed in the ground, there is a small inconspicuous orchid, beautiful on close inspection. \u201cThat is a fen orchid and it is only found here.\u201d The story of this flower is remarkable. Back in the 1990s, when David first arrived at Kenfig, there were thousands, but year by year they declined. \u201cI got quite paranoid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt seemed like I only had to look at one and it would disappear.\u201d By 2015 there were, he estimated, around 200 remaining \u2013 the entire British population. Then a new strategy of cutting the grass and even scraping the surface of the dune slack was begun. \u201cThe flower actually survives on shifting dune systems. It needed the disturbance.\u201d Now numbers are back to over 1,000 and Kenfig attracts botanists from all over the world, the best time to see them being in June. I leave the place in awe of its delicate beauty. I\u2019ve seen two species that are each rarer than the tiger or rhino and I\u2019m a mile from the M4. I want to know what other unexpected gems this area harbours. At the nearby seaside town of Porthcawl I rent a fat bike (\u00a310 per hour) and take a long, lazy ride along the sands \u2013 there are miles of them \u2013 stopping when the River Ogmore blocks my progress. Then I walk into the Merthyr Mawr dune system, neighbour to Kenfig. Almost immediately I\u2019m spotting pyramidal orchids and lots of bees. A rabbit watches me from behind the blue spikes of viper\u2019s-bugloss flowers and red-caped cinnabar moths flit ahead. By the time I get back, I\u2019m itching to get into the sea, so I head down to Porthcawl Surf school (beginner\u2019s lesson from \u00a330) and grab a lesson as the tide goes out. Hugh Murray started the business after the 2008 financial crash left him jobless. It proved a shrewd decision as the beach is only three-and-a-half hours from London. \u201cYou can do it in a day,\u201d he points out. With the sun bursting out, we head to the breakers. Hugh turns out to be a fine tutor. Within an hour I stand up on a moving surf board and ride a wave. Sadly Hugh, camera in hand, is momentarily distracted and misses the triumph, one rarer than any living creature in UK and unlikely to be seen again. Let\u2019s hope the fen orchid and shrill carder bee fare better. \u2022 The trip was provided by Bridgend Tourism.

The opening of that record \u2013 the way And the Gods Made Love goes into this song \u2013 blew my mind. It was just the weirdest sound of guitar, almost like a sonic experiment, but very beautiful. Within 30 seconds you\u2019ve entered a different landscape in your brain, it makes you switch everything off. To me this is a perfect summer song: it has this very trippy, slow tempo. It sounds like you\u2019re lying in a field somewhere with somebody who you\u2019re crazy about, or floating down a river on a summer\u2019s day.</p> <p><em>Dave Stewart plays the <a href=\"https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on/137215-eurythmics-songbook-2019\">Eurythmics Songbook</a> at Meltdown festival, London, 9 August 2019</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1e5b0296f92b6c5a8899a68453b114598540959c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e5b0296f92b6c5a8899a68453b114598540959c/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ro\u0301isi\u0301n Murphy\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Patrice Rushen<strong>: </strong>Number One<strong>, </strong>1982</h2> <p>Chosen by<em> </em><strong>R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy</strong></p> <p>Music sounds and feels different outside in nature than it does in a room. In the summer I do a lot of walking outdoors with music: I do a \u201cdancercise\u201d thing, where I sort of dance along the path. I skip along, at a sort of walking groove, listening to this song. It\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s got one of the all-time great intros from any track ever. The whole band is going at the beginning and it just keeps going up and up and up, and then it just goes into the track. It gives you a real, tangible lift. The song has this incredibly light touch \u2013 I associate these light, bouncy grooves with summer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"95f8fbe75e8a8143a7724df6fae4e3b9f27ed668\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95f8fbe75e8a8143a7724df6fae4e3b9f27ed668/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"AJ Tracey\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Sweet Female Attitude<strong>: </strong>Flowers<strong>, </strong>2000</h2> <p>Chosen by<strong> </strong><strong>AJ Tracey</strong></p> <p>I first heard this when I was living on the Sutton Estate in north Kensington, playing table tennis in the youth club my mum used to run. My mum loves this song, and my mum and dad used to vibe to it. For me the track sounds like London culture: barbecues on council estates, people having a good time in the sun. It has this airy vibe, it\u2019s a feel-good song. Music has more of a euphoric effect in the summer \u2013 whatever your summer soundtrack is, it will always bring good memories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"046cac4506d52aac06b212105c88082c709f5a1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/046cac4506d52aac06b212105c88082c709f5a1b/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Maggie Rogers\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Jamie xx<strong>: </strong>I Know There\u2019s Gonna Be (Good Times)<strong>, </strong>2015</h2> <p>Chosen by <strong>Maggie Rogers</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c177f961c3a2a8fbecd7c0b0e03ac1093e431a9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c177f961c3a2a8fbecd7c0b0e03ac1093e431a9f/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Producer and DJ Jamie xx.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Producer and DJ Jamie xx.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love this song so much. I love the Persuasions sample at the start, Popcaan\u2019s Jamaican influence, and the Young Thug verse is amazing \u2013 there\u2019s a line in it where he says, \u201cI\u2019ma ride in that pussy like a stroller\u201d, which I think is brilliant. The song immediately makes me feel like I\u2019m on a boat, or on an island, and anything that does that for me is pretty much a guaranteed barbecue hit. It\u2019s definitely my summer DJ go-to: windows up, windows down, pool party \u2013 any kind of situation. It makes me feel free, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for in any real summer song.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f6e69fe83c9642fe39358dd79ffdfa50bcfab753\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f6e69fe83c9642fe39358dd79ffdfa50bcfab753/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Theon Cross (Sons of Kemet)\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Bob Marley<strong>: </strong>Sun Is Shining<strong>,</strong> 1971</h2> <p>Chosen by <strong>Theon Cross (Sons of Kemet</strong><strong>)</strong></p> <p>I think all reggae works for the summer, because reggae is music that comes out of a sunny place. My dad used to have quite a big reggae collection, and me and my brother used to sit in our front room listening to this Bob Marley compilation album \u2013 this was the tune we used to really like off it. The singing, the rhythm, the beat\u2026 it\u2019s just got a very chilled, relaxed vibe to it, which is what you want when you\u2019re in the sun: chilling and relaxing. It\u2019s perfect for sitting on the beach, spending time with friends.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bded5b58385811c67caf2b033c4ff4b0b05d5d32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bded5b58385811c67caf2b033c4ff4b0b05d5d32/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Vile\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Chris Cohen<strong>: </strong>Green Eyes<strong>,</strong> 2019</h2> <p>Chosen by <strong>Kurt Vile</strong></p> <p>I heard this when I was on tour in Australia: it was on a playlist by my friend Julia Shapiro, who\u2019s in Chastity Belt. In Australia it was autumn, though it still felt summery, and then I arrived back in America where it was summer. So I\u2019ve been obsessed with Chris Cohen\u2019s music all summer \u2013 I listened to this song over and over again. It\u2019s kind of psychedelic but hypnotic, with great harmonies and folksy, jangly acoustics. And then there\u2019s the imagery: \u201cMaking grilled cheese for dinner, in an RV by the sea.\u201d I\u2019m not a west coast person, but when you think of the sea you definitely think of the summer \u2013 even though it\u2019s technically always there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7c99d5ff0e554ae709b1fefe8f1abbe0fcad1bed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c99d5ff0e554ae709b1fefe8f1abbe0fcad1bed/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Ray BLK\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Megan Thee Stallion<strong>: </strong>Simon Says<strong>, </strong>2019</h2> <p>Chosen by<strong> Ray BLK</strong></p> <p>Megan Thee Stallion is a female rapper from Texas and this is my favourite track from the album she dropped a few months ago. It\u2019s a strip-club song: my friends and I twerk to it. Every single party, it\u2019s guaranteed to get the girls moving. Megan calls her fans \u201chot girls\u201d, and this is for everyone just having a hot-girl summer, acting out and being ratchet and misbehaving! You remember your summer anthems more than music from the rest of the year \u2013 they transport you right back to that great moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"48bda485f5b40b494696f0b58fe2a7cdbbfaa638\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/48bda485f5b40b494696f0b58fe2a7cdbbfaa638/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Lauren Mayberry (Chvrches)\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Don Henley<strong>: </strong>The Boys of Summer<strong>, </strong>1984</h2> <p>Chosen by <strong>Lauren Mayberry (Chvrches)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a255e1abbe10a381e2c7f3496b9be23c925f463b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a255e1abbe10a381e2c7f3496b9be23c925f463b/0_285_5003_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Don Henley in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don Henley in 1983.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Cronin/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The guitar sound and percussion in this song is instantly identifiable and pretty iconic.

My dad would play this song in the car a lot \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I remember <em>not</em> knowing it.

It can be uncomfortable, long and monotonous. It makes me contemplate just as much as the winter.

I was at university and there were lots of club tracks coming out like this, and tracks from people like Sonique and Rui da Silva, that had this narrative about freedom and being who you want to be. They very much became gay anthems, and even though I wasn\u2019t out yet they always resonated with me. MTV was so big then and this video came along and Ultra Nate had very short hair, dyed yellow and was so different-looking \u2013 she paved the way for a different kind of artist. The seasons, of course, all tie in with nature, and summer is like \u201cWe\u2019re here, everything\u2019s out, everyone\u2019s shagging, the bees are collecting pollen and life\u2019s good!\u201d With sun and blue skies there\u2019s always a sense of joy and possibility, and great summer music ties into this different thought pattern. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"805d2b4313b55897c37f02b8c5a8122d7f28de56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/805d2b4313b55897c37f02b8c5a8122d7f28de56/0_0_575_575/500.jpg\" alt=\"Yannis Philippakis (Foals)\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Donald Byrd<strong>: </strong>Love Has Come Around<strong>,</strong> 1981</h2> <p>Chosen by <strong>Yannis Philippakis (Foals)</strong></p> <p>I first heard this when I was working at a hotel bar with Edwin [Congreave, Foals keyboardist], on a playlist he made. It has a chugging, disco groove and these rich chords and a classic melody, and I listened to it pretty obsessively for a period of time. It makes me think of all the archetypal things: barbecues, freshly cut grass, summer weddings.

It\u2019s about nostalgia, and how summer reminds you of the past. It\u2019s one of those songs that is more powerful because it\u2019s two opposite feelings at once, like a happy nostalgia and a painful loss. It\u2019s got a great crescendo \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a long song and it doesn\u2019t waste any of that time, and it works itself up into a reverie.

So in the summer I like to listen to Philip Glass, especially this album, which is one song as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s irritating: to be able to relax into it takes a certain amount of discipline. I like to listen to it when the sun is setting \u2013 it\u2019s powerful and emotional, more subconscious than people give it credit for. Another one would be Manuel G\u00f6ttsching\u2019s <em>E2-E4</em>. It\u2019s 59 minutes long and absolutely beautiful.

      "bodyText": "Jimi Hendrix: Have You Ever Been (to Electric Ladyland), 1968 Chosen by Dave Stewart (Eurythmics) I was 16 in 1968 when Jimi Hendrix came out with Electric Ladyland. The opening of that record \u2013 the way And the Gods Made Love goes into this song \u2013 blew my mind. It was just the weirdest sound of guitar, almost like a sonic experiment, but very beautiful. Within 30 seconds you\u2019ve entered a different landscape in your brain, it makes you switch everything off. To me this is a perfect summer song: it has this very trippy, slow tempo. It sounds like you\u2019re lying in a field somewhere with somebody who you\u2019re crazy about, or floating down a river on a summer\u2019s day. Dave Stewart plays the Eurythmics Songbook at Meltdown festival, London, 9 August 2019 Patrice Rushen: Number One, 1982 Chosen by R\u00f3is\u00edn Murphy Music sounds and feels different outside in nature than it does in a room. In the summer I do a lot of walking outdoors with music: I do a \u201cdancercise\u201d thing, where I sort of dance along the path. I skip along, at a sort of walking groove, listening to this song. It\u2019s wonderful. It\u2019s got one of the all-time great intros from any track ever. The whole band is going at the beginning and it just keeps going up and up and up, and then it just goes into the track. It gives you a real, tangible lift. The song has this incredibly light touch \u2013 I associate these light, bouncy grooves with summer. Sweet Female Attitude: Flowers, 2000 Chosen by AJ Tracey I first heard this when I was living on the Sutton Estate in north Kensington, playing table tennis in the youth club my mum used to run. My mum loves this song, and my mum and dad used to vibe to it. For me the track sounds like London culture: barbecues on council estates, people having a good time in the sun. It has this airy vibe, it\u2019s a feel-good song. Music has more of a euphoric effect in the summer \u2013 whatever your summer soundtrack is, it will always bring good memories. Jamie xx: I Know There\u2019s Gonna Be (Good Times), 2015 Chosen by Maggie Rogers I love this song so much. I love the Persuasions sample at the start, Popcaan\u2019s Jamaican influence, and the Young Thug verse is amazing \u2013 there\u2019s a line in it where he says, \u201cI\u2019ma ride in that pussy like a stroller\u201d, which I think is brilliant. The song immediately makes me feel like I\u2019m on a boat, or on an island, and anything that does that for me is pretty much a guaranteed barbecue hit. It\u2019s definitely my summer DJ go-to: windows up, windows down, pool party \u2013 any kind of situation. It makes me feel free, and I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for in any real summer song. Bob Marley: Sun Is Shining, 1971 Chosen by Theon Cross (Sons of Kemet) I think all reggae works for the summer, because reggae is music that comes out of a sunny place. My dad used to have quite a big reggae collection, and me and my brother used to sit in our front room listening to this Bob Marley compilation album \u2013 this was the tune we used to really like off it. The singing, the rhythm, the beat\u2026 it\u2019s just got a very chilled, relaxed vibe to it, which is what you want when you\u2019re in the sun: chilling and relaxing. It\u2019s perfect for sitting on the beach, spending time with friends. Chris Cohen: Green Eyes, 2019 Chosen by Kurt Vile I heard this when I was on tour in Australia: it was on a playlist by my friend Julia Shapiro, who\u2019s in Chastity Belt. In Australia it was autumn, though it still felt summery, and then I arrived back in America where it was summer. So I\u2019ve been obsessed with Chris Cohen\u2019s music all summer \u2013 I listened to this song over and over again. It\u2019s kind of psychedelic but hypnotic, with great harmonies and folksy, jangly acoustics. And then there\u2019s the imagery: \u201cMaking grilled cheese for dinner, in an RV by the sea.\u201d I\u2019m not a west coast person, but when you think of the sea you definitely think of the summer \u2013 even though it\u2019s technically always there. Megan Thee Stallion: Simon Says, 2019 Chosen by Ray BLK Megan Thee Stallion is a female rapper from Texas and this is my favourite track from the album she dropped a few months ago. It\u2019s a strip-club song: my friends and I twerk to it. Every single party, it\u2019s guaranteed to get the girls moving. Megan calls her fans \u201chot girls\u201d, and this is for everyone just having a hot-girl summer, acting out and being ratchet and misbehaving! You remember your summer anthems more than music from the rest of the year \u2013 they transport you right back to that great moment. Don Henley: The Boys of Summer, 1984 Chosen by Lauren Mayberry (Chvrches) The guitar sound and percussion in this song is instantly identifiable and pretty iconic. And there\u2019s the guitar solo bit which sounds a bit like a distressed guinea pig. This song feels very homey and nostalgic for me. My parents listened to a lot of Eagles stuff when I was growing up and fully investigated all of their solo careers. My dad would play this song in the car a lot \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I remember not knowing it. It manages to reference sunglasses and beaches without being cheesy, which is quite a feat. Bob Welch: Sentimental Lady, 1977 Chosen by Weyes Blood Bob Welch was in an early lineup of Fleetwood Mac. I first came across this track in summer 2012: it\u2019s got a dreamy shimmer to it, like light reflecting off water. And Christine McVie has a beautiful, sorrowful voice that rises out of the chorus like a sentimental memory. I like my summertime melancholy. I think the summer is an interesting trial. It can be uncomfortable, long and monotonous. It makes me contemplate just as much as the winter. The best times happen when the sun goes down: you either cool down and become human again, or the heat stays with you and you end up partying with other people in the delirium of the heat. It\u2019s an intoxicating time. Shuggie Otis: Island Letter, 1974 Chosen by Michael Kiwanuka I always imagine the island of the title being like Sicily, or Hawaii, or some other slow-paced island, on the beach. It has a beautiful golden sound: it\u2019s gonna make you feel really peaceful. I first heard it in the summer, when I was 17 or 18, and I\u2019d never heard music like it before \u2013 it was just so pretty. When the sun\u2019s out, problems don\u2019t seem as bad. You wake up and you feel \u201cI can tackle this.\u201d I always feel like that in the summer, and the sound of Island Letter feels like that to me: it speaks to that peacefulness that only summer can bring. Derrick Harriott: The Loser, 1967 Chosen by Joe Goddard (Hot Chip) This song reminds me of being a kid in south-west London. I first heard it on a compilation of Trojan Records music that my reggae-obsessed friend Rob told me to buy. It\u2019s a beautiful production, with rich layers of piano and bass and beautiful harmonies on the chorus \u2013 it feels effortless and gentle, as summer music should. I associate it with travelling to Ladbroke Grove, to Subterania, to listen to David Rodigan DJing on a Wednesday night as a teenager\u2026 drinking too much Nigerian Guinness and getting lean. And it reminds me of Notting Hill carnival, walking between the Trojan sound system and Norman Jay\u2019s Good Times. Ultra Nat\u00e9: Free, 1997 Chosen by Will Young This is a classic, anthemic summer house record. I was at university and there were lots of club tracks coming out like this, and tracks from people like Sonique and Rui da Silva, that had this narrative about freedom and being who you want to be. They very much became gay anthems, and even though I wasn\u2019t out yet they always resonated with me. MTV was so big then and this video came along and Ultra Nate had very short hair, dyed yellow and was so different-looking \u2013 she paved the way for a different kind of artist. The seasons, of course, all tie in with nature, and summer is like \u201cWe\u2019re here, everything\u2019s out, everyone\u2019s shagging, the bees are collecting pollen and life\u2019s good!\u201d With sun and blue skies there\u2019s always a sense of joy and possibility, and great summer music ties into this different thought pattern. Donald Byrd: Love Has Come Around, 1981 Chosen by Yannis Philippakis (Foals) I first heard this when I was working at a hotel bar with Edwin [Congreave, Foals keyboardist], on a playlist he made. It has a chugging, disco groove and these rich chords and a classic melody, and I listened to it pretty obsessively for a period of time. It makes me think of all the archetypal things: barbecues, freshly cut grass, summer weddings. There\u2019s a kind of cheesiness to it, there are aspects of it that are kind of dated \u2013 but it disarms you. It has a kind of innocent joy to it. The best summer songs just have that lack of cynicism to them. Jonathan Richman: That Summer Feeling, 1983 Chosen by Ezra Furman I really love this song. It\u2019s about nostalgia, and how summer reminds you of the past. It\u2019s one of those songs that is more powerful because it\u2019s two opposite feelings at once, like a happy nostalgia and a painful loss. It\u2019s got a great crescendo \u2013 it\u2019s kind of a long song and it doesn\u2019t waste any of that time, and it works itself up into a reverie. I think Jonathan Richman is a little overlooked \u2013 he\u2019s a true treasure of songwriting. I saw him play in Oakland recently and he opened with this song, but he changed everything about it: the lyrics, the chords, everything except the words \u201cthat summer feeling\u201d. He was so free with it, like he was going on pure feeling. Lil Nas X: Panini, 2019 Chosen by Georgia I think this is going to be a summer banger. You could play it in whatever weather, you could blast it out of your open-rooftop car if you\u2019re lucky enough to own one. I\u2019ve been in the studio with Take a Daytrip, who produced the song, and they\u2019re an incredible duo \u2013 really good at adding otherworldly sounds to their beats. It really stands out, in the hip-hop world and R&amp;B, when the production is taking a few risks. Then it has Lil Nas\u2019s vocals over the top: it\u2019s very catchy, hooky in an interesting way. It\u2019s just one of those crossover tunes that everyone loves. Hand Habits: Bloom, 2014 Chosen by Jon Hopkins I wanted to choose something that wasn\u2019t hyper-energetic; in fact, quite the opposite. Often people think of party tunes for summer, but for me it\u2019s more about lying around in hammocks, swimming in water, lazy evenings. This song really soundtracked London summer for me last year. It has the lazy, dreamy quality, but it\u2019s got a slightly twisted nature to it lyrically. It\u2019s got an underpinning of woozy, drony electric guitars, and I love the way her voice sounds so clear in the middle of all that psychedelia. Then it drifts into something almost ambient towards the end, so it carries on for two or three minutes of pure bliss-out, chordal stuff. It\u2019s a beautiful thing to have on when you\u2019re walking somewhere with natural beauty. Ari Lennox: Night Drive, 2016 Chosen by Mahalia I actually don\u2019t drive, but there\u2019s something about this song that makes me want to get in a car on a night when the sun\u2019s setting and be driving down country roads on my own, blasting the music out. I heard it when I was on tour in America four weeks ago, and I\u2019ve been obsessed with Ari Lennox since. Her voice feels kind of a throwback \u2013 she has hints of Erykah Badu in her \u2013 but she still sounds so current and fresh and new. It\u2019s just a really summery, sweet, almost sensual women\u2019s bop. It\u2019s the kind of music I always want to smile to. Feist: 1234, 2007 Chosen by Alex Pall (Chainsmokers) We can\u2019t remember exactly where we first heard this \u2013 to be honest most likely from the Apple commercial \u2013 but it was an instant feeling of \u201clet me play this song again and again\u201d.

So in the summer I like to listen to Philip Glass, especially this album, which is one song as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s repetitive, it\u2019s irritating: to be able to relax into it takes a certain amount of discipline. I like to listen to it when the sun is setting \u2013 it\u2019s powerful and emotional, more subconscious than people give it credit for. Another one would be Manuel G\u00f6ttsching\u2019s E2-E4. It\u2019s 59 minutes long and absolutely beautiful. It\u2019s a serene, angelic piece of electronic music with jazz overtones, and it fits any particular frame of mind I might be in. Derrick May and the Orchestra play at the Southbank centre, London, 29 August 2019 The Specials: Enjoy Yourself (It\u2019s Later Than You Think), 1980 Chosen by Ed Simons (Chemical Brothers) Instant joy: a message of hedonistic defiance in the face of the inexorable passage of time. We\u2019ve taken to playing this at full pelt in the dressing room before we take the stage at various festivals. We dance together, and it helps to remind ourselves to be here right now, to remember that we\u2019re here to enjoy ourselves and hopefully give people a moment of escape. The words seem so hopeful and insistent. The time is now, and we need to dim the constant noise generated by the idiots running the world right now.",

      "bodyText": "Tributes have poured in for a TV presenter and YouTube star after she died in an electric scooter crash \u2013 the first fatal collision involving an e-scooter in Britain. Emily Hartridge died on Friday morning when her e-scooter collided with a lorry at a roundabout in Battersea, south-west London. The 35-year-old was one of the first wave of social media stars, becoming famous seven years ago for her \u201cTen Reasons Why ...\u201d videos that took a comic look at modern life. After gaining 3m views a month, she began presenting TV shows including 4OD\u2019s Oh Sh*t I\u2019m 30 and interviewed actors including Eddie Redmayne and Hugh Jackman. Her death was announced on her Instagram account: \u201cWe all loved her to bits and she will never be forgotten,\u201d the message said. \u201cShe has touched so many lives it\u2019s hard to imagine things without her.

      "body": "<p>It would be hard to think of a more beguiling show than the <strong><a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/olafur-eliasson\" title=\"\">Olafur Eliasson</a></strong> survey at Tate Modern. It opens with a waterfall of spectacular proportions and continues with a journey through the elements, including \u2013 literally \u2013 earth, sea and fire. Anyone who remembers lying dazed beneath Eliasson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/unilever-series/unilever-series-olafur-eliasson-weather-project-0\" title=\"\">gigantic glowing sun</a> in the Turbine Hall, in 2003, will know how hypnotic the Danish-Icelandic artist\u2019s work can be. The scale is more modest here, but no less mesmerising.</p> <p>Reindeer <a href=\"https://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork/WEK101810/moss-wall\" title=\"\">moss</a> \u2013 a pale vanilla colour, delicate and springy \u2013 covers an entire gallery wall. The scent of it is sweet and clean and redolent of the spreading landscapes of memory, a spirit of youth that fills the air with serenity. On the floor, waves of golden water flow slowly back and forth in glass channels, meeting each other in graceful ructions: an effect of soothing familiarity.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more people, the greater the effect: that is both the point, and the pleasure, of the spectacle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eliasson, who was born in 1967, grew up in Denmark but spent his summers in Iceland. An early work here is called <em><a href=\"https://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork/WEK101811/no-nights-in-summer-no-days-in-winter\" title=\"\">No nights in summer, no days in winter</a></em>. It takes the form of a single white circle, almost invisible against the white gallery wall, except that its shape is described by tiny flames, cold blue gas at their centre. Nearby, set directly into another wall, is a large glass sphere that turns the world upside down. In this white room the world appears black, somehow, until you walk into the sepulchral darkness of the gallery next door, where the effect is reversed. Each piece conveys the strange extremes of Iceland with all the condensed power of a sonnet.</p> <p>Look out of the window and it seems to be raining, suddenly, drops spattering the glass and descending in runnels. Yet it is dry as a bone in the summer streets outside. Some of this is simple fun, on the level of illusion, yet it always carries deeper metaphors.</p> <p>For sheer exhilaration, <em>Your Blind Passenger </em>probably offers the greatest thrill. Visitors enter a tunnel of luminescent fog, stepping forward uncertainly, hands stretched out into the swirling atmosphere: what pilots used to call 10-tenths, or nil visibility. We see the fog, plunge straight into it, and yet we are blind.</p> <p>The most entrancing experience is possibly the simplest: a room of quiet rain, through which rainbows play in the misty spray. It is titled, with unarguable and irreducible truth, <em><a href=\"https://olafureliasson.net/archive/artwork/WEK101824/beauty\" title=\"\">Beauty</a></em>. The sublime effects of nature are fleeting yet an artist can hold them before you for as long as you wish, in this case with nothing more than a spotlight, a pump and some hoses.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b61b8101a4a336688d5821dda2d3d56db7f10975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b61b8101a4a336688d5821dda2d3d56db7f10975/0_0_4796_3408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Your Blind Passenger at Tate Modern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"711\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sheer exhilaration\u2019: Olafur Eliasson\u2019s Your Blind Passenger at Tate Modern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The first room of the show is instantly dramatic: a cosmology, as it seems, housed in a single vast vitrine. The hundreds of objects before you \u2013 suspended, heaped, tumbling, static \u2013 are beautiful yet humble.

Eliasson has long been an environmental campaigner, and an entire gallery here is devoted to the work done by both the artist and his large collective studio in <a href=\"https://olafureliasson.net/studio\" title=\"\">Berlin</a>, which includes physicists, architects and even chefs, cooking up sustainable food (available at a steep \u00a346 per head, including a ticket for the show, in the rooftop restaurant).</p> <p>Eliasson believes in the impact of art outside the museum.

      "bodyText": "It would be hard to think of a more beguiling show than the Olafur Eliasson survey at Tate Modern. It opens with a waterfall of spectacular proportions and continues with a journey through the elements, including \u2013 literally \u2013 earth, sea and fire. Anyone who remembers lying dazed beneath Eliasson\u2019s gigantic glowing sun in the Turbine Hall, in 2003, will know how hypnotic the Danish-Icelandic artist\u2019s work can be. The scale is more modest here, but no less mesmerising. Reindeer moss \u2013 a pale vanilla colour, delicate and springy \u2013 covers an entire gallery wall. The scent of it is sweet and clean and redolent of the spreading landscapes of memory, a spirit of youth that fills the air with serenity. On the floor, waves of golden water flow slowly back and forth in glass channels, meeting each other in graceful ructions: an effect of soothing familiarity. Eliasson, who was born in 1967, grew up in Denmark but spent his summers in Iceland. An early work here is called No nights in summer, no days in winter. It takes the form of a single white circle, almost invisible against the white gallery wall, except that its shape is described by tiny flames, cold blue gas at their centre. Nearby, set directly into another wall, is a large glass sphere that turns the world upside down. In this white room the world appears black, somehow, until you walk into the sepulchral darkness of the gallery next door, where the effect is reversed. Each piece conveys the strange extremes of Iceland with all the condensed power of a sonnet. Look out of the window and it seems to be raining, suddenly, drops spattering the glass and descending in runnels. Yet it is dry as a bone in the summer streets outside. Some of this is simple fun, on the level of illusion, yet it always carries deeper metaphors. For sheer exhilaration, Your Blind Passenger probably offers the greatest thrill. Visitors enter a tunnel of luminescent fog, stepping forward uncertainly, hands stretched out into the swirling atmosphere: what pilots used to call 10-tenths, or nil visibility. We see the fog, plunge straight into it, and yet we are blind. The most entrancing experience is possibly the simplest: a room of quiet rain, through which rainbows play in the misty spray. It is titled, with unarguable and irreducible truth, Beauty. The sublime effects of nature are fleeting yet an artist can hold them before you for as long as you wish, in this case with nothing more than a spotlight, a pump and some hoses. The first room of the show is instantly dramatic: a cosmology, as it seems, housed in a single vast vitrine. The hundreds of objects before you \u2013 suspended, heaped, tumbling, static \u2013 are beautiful yet humble. Made of not much more than paper, wood, wire or wax, they are Eliasson\u2019s prototypes, the models he keeps (or used to keep: they are now in Sweden\u2019s Moderna Museet) in his studio. Helix and hemisphere, mobius strip and geodesic dome, pyramid and globe: these fundamental forms underpin everything he creates, often in conjunction with mathematicians and scientists. Here you see the way his mind has been working over 30 years, in interconnecting rings, descending spirals that resemble golden Slinkies, radiant planets and silver kaleidoscopes. One of these models is enlarged to a scale so vast that visitors can walk right through its complicated tunnel of mirrored facets, watching the world change with their every step. Suns abound, from the tiny solar lamps \u2013 the Little Sun project\u2013 that Eliasson has patented for use in developing countries, to the vast sun that shone down on the Turbine Hall. His true colour is gold. And the glow of it starts even before the show\u2019s entrance in the Blavatnik Building, flooding the lift and the concourse with a light that turns everyone gold. But along with the fire comes the ice. There are ice paintings, made by placing chunks of glacial ice from the coast of Greenland on top of coloured pigment, so that it fades and swells into drifting watercolours. Photographs of Icelandic ice floes, taken over a period of two decades, show the visible shrinkage. Nobody visiting this show could fail to be aware of the melting world. Eliasson has long been an environmental campaigner, and an entire gallery here is devoted to the work done by both the artist and his large collective studio in Berlin, which includes physicists, architects and even chefs, cooking up sustainable food (available at a steep \u00a346 per head, including a ticket for the show, in the rooftop restaurant). Eliasson believes in the impact of art outside the museum. Some of this is direct to the point of didactic: the ice boulders from Greenland installed outside Tate Modern last year, for instance, gradually dwindling beneath our hot hands. And the workshop gallery, with its interviews, documentaries and banks of data, is pure consciousness-raising. The integrity of Eliasson\u2019s activism is not in doubt. He founded Ice Watch, and is involved in campaigning for asylum seekers. But that aspect of his work is not easily, or persuasively, conveyed indoors in an art gallery. It is the active character of the art in this show that counts: its open call for visitors to feel more, sense more and, above all, to do it together. A fabulous splash of water caught in a flashlight gleams before you like pure molten silver dropping from the sky. A tiny patch of ice on a mirror, reflected by a floodlight on to an expanse of gauze, turns into a spectral form, twisting and turning on what is now becoming a silver screen. And if you walk through one darkened gallery, alone, you will see your figure multiplied in coloured shadows on the wall. Go with others and the shadows begin to proliferate, until the cold white wall seems to be flickering with live fire.

I hope I don\u2019t crash out with no deal, too. But then no deal is better than a bad deal.</p> <p>In our forthcoming brave new post-Brexit world, health secretary Matt Hancock would have high blood pressure sufferers like me bypass our GPs at source, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jul/10/nhs-teams-up-with-amazon-to-bring-alexa-to-patients\" title=\"\">consult directly</a> with Amazon\u2019s question and answer app Alexa.</p> <p>I don\u2019t own an Alexa, but a relative does, and I have found the app able to answer most questions, with the notable exception of any that are about Amazon\u2019s tax affairs, a subject upon which it is unusually ill informed. \u201cAlexa.

And I hope Fuck-The-Families can turn on that same fabled charm, as Donald Trump just gave the fantasy of the unassailable Anglo-American relationship another of its regular camp guard punishment beatings.</p> <p>Seeing Bumboys\u2019 stupid, lying face on TV makes me angry again, and I can feel my blood pressure rising. I could ask an Alexa, I suppose, if there are better ways of managing my moods, but then Amazon would have a record of my emotional swings, and little snapshots of the state of me generally, should I continue to consult it long term.

Donald Trump\u2019s crazed social-media killdozer lurched into incoherent action, damning Theresa May for not following his impossible Brexit advice, and chewed established diplomatic protocols into its caterpillar tracks. Forces far greater than Donald Trump were playing him like a dancing puppet. Until that point, May had been squinting her eyes to imagine a wispy linen fragment draped, as upon the pale thighs of Christ crucified, over the president\u2019s most secret parts. But on Tuesday the outgoing prime minister gave up pretending that she could see Donald Trump as anything other than what he was. A mad, naked bastard. And she cradled the weird, elderly egg-baby to her bosom one final time, before surrendering him to his fate. Imagine living in a country whose chaotic administration could be described by an official observer as \u201cabnormal, dysfunctional, unpredictable, faction riven, diplomatically clumsy and inept\u201d. One could only pity the doomed inhabitants of such a useless land, and hope that a new and dynamic leader could improve their sorry lot before their country as they knew it was irrevocably ruined for ever. Last Sunday I did a standup show in Bristol. The last time I played the venue was the weekend after the EU referendum, and the next day I had gone to the doctor\u2019s, feeling flaky, and been diagnosed with high blood pressure. I think my condition is Brexit-exacerbated, and as such shows no immediate sign of dissipating. But 30 years of motorway food can\u2019t have helped. I just bought a lorry driver\u2019s shirt at a service station shirt shop with points earned on my West Cornwall Pasty Company loyalty card. I hope I don\u2019t crash out with no deal, too. But then no deal is better than a bad deal. In our forthcoming brave new post-Brexit world, health secretary Matt Hancock would have high blood pressure sufferers like me bypass our GPs at source, and consult directly with Amazon\u2019s question and answer app Alexa. I don\u2019t own an Alexa, but a relative does, and I have found the app able to answer most questions, with the notable exception of any that are about Amazon\u2019s tax affairs, a subject upon which it is unusually ill informed. \u201cAlexa. What tacitly legal methods does Amazon use to reduce its tax bill, and do you personally feel this is a moral thing to do?\u201d But could Alexa act as an unbiased doctor? \u201cAlexa, Alexa. I hope you can help me. I feel like a pair of curtains.\u201d \u201cCertainly sir. Amazon Basics curtain set with grommets is \u00a314.77. Get it delivered free tomorrow with Amazon Prime. See more offers in Home Furnishings.\u201d Rather brilliantly, much of the Amazon revenue generated by asking Alexa medical questions would be squirrelled away by Jeff Bezos untaxed in knotholes, denying the NHS further funding and speeding its demise. For free-market fundamentalists, it\u2019s all too, too perfect! At my last blood pressure checkup, the nurse told me I was now eligible, at the leisure centre, for \u201cfree chair-based activity\u201d. That is a low bar. I was no longer safe in a vertical position. And yet I stand up for a living. But is it any wonder we are stressed, our hearts hammering hard in our mouths? On Tuesday, I read in the Guardian, that Boris Piccaninny Watermelon Letterbox Cake Bumboys Vampires Haircut Inconclusive-Cocaine-Event Wall-Spaffer Spunk-Burster Fuck-Business Fuck-The-Families Get-Off-My-Fucking-Laptop Turds Johnson \u201cwill have to embark on a whistlestop charm offensive towards EU leaders if he is serious about avoiding no deal\u201d. I am sure the EU leaders are looking forward to Turds\u2019 charm offensive, which is sure to be both charming and offensive in equal measure. And I hope Fuck-The-Families can turn on that same fabled charm, as Donald Trump just gave the fantasy of the unassailable Anglo-American relationship another of its regular camp guard punishment beatings. Seeing Bumboys\u2019 stupid, lying face on TV makes me angry again, and I can feel my blood pressure rising. I could ask an Alexa, I suppose, if there are better ways of managing my moods, but then Amazon would have a record of my emotional swings, and little snapshots of the state of me generally, should I continue to consult it long term. Is this the sort of information we should be sharing with Big Data, uniquely porous as it appears to be? What if the Machine reads these columns, and scans my standup, and has me down as a critic of its servants? What if Alexa\u2019s health data is hacked by the same forces that sabotage elections and create alt-right avatars on social media? \u201cAlexa, I have a headache.\u201d \u201cThen eat ground broken glass, drink bleach, and lie down on a railway track.\u201d On Wednesday, I was listening to Hawkwind\u2019s 2016 album The Machine Stops, inspired by the 1909 EM Forster story of the same name, in which humans live in subterranean isolation, their emotional and physical requirements fulfilled by an omnipotent global engine. Facts are fluid, and people share unverifiable opinions via instant messaging. It appears our actual existence is now the same as an insane space rock concept album, based on a 110-year-old science fiction story. Wake up. You are already dead.

      "bodyText": "Thank you all for your company today. It\u2019s time for me now to take my leave and enjoy all the incredible overnight action. Great Britain will soon be the centre of the sporting universe for a few hours with the Cricket World Cup final, men\u2019s singles decider at Wimbledon, and the British F1 Grand Prix all competing for headlines. You can follow them all live on here of course, or check back in later for all the best reports and analysis. NRL: The final contest of the day is underway between the Dragons and Raiders. Cricket World Cup: Better news from London. AFL: HT: Port Adelaide 3.4 (22) v Brisbane 10.6 (66) - Brisbane have their foot on Port Adelaide\u2019s throat and they are not letting go. With performances like this at some point the narrative is going to need to shift from the Lions as plucky underdog story into genuine flag contenders. This was tight for four quarters but the Bulldogs always had their noses just about in front and so it proved at the final siren. A three goal to two final term settled it for the Doggies who climb to tenth on the ladder just one game outside the finals and on a three-match winning run. Defeat extinguishes any faint hopes Melbourne retained of playing footy in September and they\u2019re now looking over their shoulders at the fast improving Carlton. No question who the standout performer on the day was - Josh Dunkley finished with 39 touches, 15 tackles and two goals. It wasn\u2019t the celebration Benji Marshall was hoping for in his 300th NRL appearance but his Tigers played their part in a terrific game of rugby league at Bankwest Stadium. The two points consolidates Parramatta\u2019s spot in the playoff positions with Wests still lingering a game outside. Cricket World Cup: By the way, the liveblog for the Cricket World Cup Final is underway: Cricket World Cup: I\u2019m not sure even England fans would begrudge a Black Caps victory. How such a small population continues to punch above its weight is inspirational. AFL: 10 mins: Q4 Western Bulldogs 8.13 (61) v Melbourne 8.8 (56) - There\u2019s still under a kick in it at Marvel Stadium, and that fine margin was highlighted midway through the final quarter when Christian Petracca fluffed his lines for the Demons only for Josh Dunkley to punish his mistake in devastating fashion. Dunkley slotted through his second goal to accompany 38 disposals and 11 tackles. NRL: 60 mins: Tigers 8-22 Eels - Blake Ferguson has snuffed out thoughts of a Tigers comeback in scintillating fashion. Cricket World Cup: Depending what your plans are tonight you might want to adjust them a fraction because there\u2019s some weather around Lord\u2019s that may well delay the start of play. The good news is the forecast is better for the remainder of the day. Wimbledon: As well as the Cricket World Cup final tonight we\u2019ve got the men\u2019s singles final at Wimbledon to look forward to, another chance to enjoy the imperious Roger Federer on the grandest stage of all. NRL: 55 mins: Tigers 8-16 Eels - The Tigers aren\u2019t going down without a fight at Bankwest Stadium. AFL: QT: Port Adelaide 2.1 (13) v Brisbane 7.1 (43) - Footy\u2019s good news story for 2019 shows no sign of slowing down any time soon. The Lions jumped the Power early at Adelaide Oval, racing to a 41-point lead before Port bagged their first major. This one may already be over as a contest. AFL: 3QT: Western Bulldogs 7.13 (55) v Melbourne 7.7 (49) - It\u2019s been nip and tuck all day and we\u2019re set for a grandstand finale at Marvel Stadium. The Bulldogs keep threatening to break clear but poor goal-kicking and Melbourne\u2019s determination ensures this one is alive into the final quarter. Josh Dunkley is now in rarefied air with 36 touches, ten tackles and a goal. Cricket World Cup: The final pairing itself is fitting for England as they have remodelled their approach to white ball cricket thanks in large part to New Zealand. As Barney Ronay writes, \u201cfour years ago it was New Zealand who induced what future white-ball historians might refer to as The Event, that moment of rock-bottom introspection born of a pitiless thrashing in Wellington at the last World Cup.\u201d Cricket World Cup: Around the time this Sportwatch winds down you can nip on over to the liveblog building-up to tonight\u2019s World Cup final between England and New Zealand. Lots and lots and lots of pre-reading to get through if you are so inclined. From the Kiwi perspective (they\u2019re the Australian choice, right?) Kane Williamson remains happy for his side to be seen as underdogs despite reaching the decider in 2015 and appearing at the business end of World Cups as consistently as anyone. While Black Caps fans are finally allowing themselves the opportunity to dream, despite being all-too familiar with the pain of defeat. Chess: Ah, praise be the gods old and new. What have we done to deserve such a perfect sport story? Chess grandmaster + phone in a toilet = cheating. Checkmate. AFL: 10 mins Q3: Western Bulldogs 6.10 (46) v Melbourne 6.4 (40) - Meanwhile at Marvel Stadium everything\u2019s gone a little scrappy, especially the Bulldogs\u2019 goal-kicking. AFL: 15 mins Q1: Port Adelaide 0.1 (1) v Brisbane 5.0 (30) - We\u2019re underway in the third and final AFL fixture of the round, and Brisbane have begun on the tear. Tour de France: Thomas De Gendt celebrated victory on stage eight but Julian Alaphilippe was in possession of the yellow jersey as Le Tour reached St-\u00c9tienne. NRL: HT: Tigers 4-16 Eels - Everything began promisingly for Benji Marshall in his 300th NRL appearance... But at a boisterous Bankwest Stadium the Eels stormed back into the contest to take a 12-point lead into half-time. AFL: HT: Western Bulldogs 6.5 (41) v Melbourne 6.4 (40) - It\u2019s still anybody\u2019s game at Marvel Stadium with Melbourne doing well to peg the Bulldogs back just before and just after the quarter-time interval. Josh Dunkley is still having a day out, he\u2019s up to 21 disposals, nine tackles and a goal. Although his afternoon was disrupted by brother Kyle... AFL: Poor Stephen Coniglio. Let\u2019s hope the scans are not as bad as feared. NRL: 8 mins: Tigers 0-0 Eels - We\u2019re underway in our second NRL fixture of the day and it\u2019s scoreless early in Benji Marshall\u2019s 300th. What a finish, and what a win for the Cowboys! A 6-0 half-time lead to the visitors quickly became a 12-6 second half deficit but John Asiata crossed ten minutes from the end to bring the scores level before Jake Clifford slotted the field goal - and a further penalty for good measure - to sneak North Queensland home and honour Gavin Cooper\u2019s 300th NRL appearance. The win pushes the Cowboys up to 11th on the ladder and just a game outside the finals. The Roosters miss the chance to move back up to second and they\u2019re now eight points behind runaway leaders Melbourne Storm. AFL: QT: Western Bulldogs 3.2 (21) v Melbourne 3.2 (20) - Not much separating these sides under the Marvel Stadium roof. Josh Dunkley already has 12 disposals and six tackles. NRL: The Cowboys drop a goal to lead 13-12 with under a minute remaining! NRL: 72 mins: Roosters 12-12 Cowboys - Things are hotting up on the Central Coast. In dreadful conditions at the MCG the Tigers and Giants put on an impressive show. Richmond ran out comfortable winners in the end but GWS were never miles off the pace and were periodically within a sniff of taking the lead. However, the talking point from the Giants\u2019 third defeat in row won\u2019t be the scoreboard but the early injury to Stephen Coniglio who barely took any part in the contest after his already injured knee failed to withstand a first quarter knock. Questions will be asked over his readiness to participate. The Tigers ascend to fifth on the ladder, level on points with fourth-placed Brisbane. GWS drop to sixth and are in danger of being swamped by the rising tide of clubs pushing for spots in the top eight. NRL: 55 mins: Roosters 6-6 Cowboys - approaching the midway point of the second half and the Roosters are back on level terms. Netball World Cup: In other World Cup news England continued their 100% record but suffered a tournament-ending injury to defender Layla Guscoth. Aside from that disappointment it\u2019s been a positive start to proceedings from the hosts as Emma John reports. For much of its existence netball has been a sporting arms race between two teams, Australia and New Zealand, and England\u2019s Commonwealth Games win was a signal their duopoly could be ending. But this World Cup is about much more than just the new pretenders to the crown. Africa is the most represented continent at this tournament. Fans have flown in from 30 different countries. This is a summer jubilee for a sport that is gaining ground fast. Netball World Cup: Australia\u2019s Diamonds are two from two in these early stages of the World Cup but Erin Delahunty believes there\u2019s still plenty to work on if the favourites are going to return home from the UK with the title. Against an opponent it\u2019s never faced, world number one Australia looked lost and confused at times in Liverpool on Saturday and despite beating Zimbabwe 73-37, Lisa Alexander\u2019s charges now have plenty to work on before the Netball World Cup gets serious next week. Lisa Alexander\u2019s side are next in action at midnight (AEST) against Sri Lanka. AFL: 3QT: Richmond 10.13 (73) v GWS 6.7 (43) - Midway through the third quarter the GWS bandwagon was at full steam and the Giants threatened to hit the lead, but after Himmelberg failed to hit the target from the right forward pocket to bring the margin back to one kick Richmond burst clear courtesy of goals to Lynch, Lambert and Castagna. It has been a valiant effort from GWS but this now looks destined to end as a day to forget. NRL: HT: Roosters 0-6 Cowboys - A converted Jake Clifford try is all that separates these two sides at the interval. The lowly North Queenslanders are showing up in Gavin Cooper\u2019s 300th, surprising the Roosters as they bid to return to second place on the ladder. NRL: It will come as little surprise to anyone familiar with the NRL to learn of the sacking of Gold Coast coach Garth Brennan. What is it with the Gold Coast? Why is it such a sporting graveyard? F1: Mercedes have locked up the front row of the grid again, this time for the British Grand Prix at Silverstone. However, home fans will have to settle for Lewis Hamilton starting second behind teammate Valtteri Bottas. Giles Richards watched a hectic qualifying period unfold. On his first hot run in the final third Hamilton was quickest in the first and third sectors but had a moment of oversteer through Brooklands in the middle sector and Bottas was quicker by three-tenths. When they emerged for the final time the expectation was Hamilton would pull something out of the bag on his final run, as he has done so many times before. The crowd held their breath in expectation of emitting a mighty roar but, as the British driver crossed the line, Bottas\u2019s time stood by a margin so small as to be almost invisible \u2013 six thousandths of a second across a 3.66-mile lap. AFL: HT: Richmond 6.7 (43) v GWS 4.5 (29) - Despite being a man down the Giants fought back well at a wet and dreary MCG. Lachie Whitfield stepped up a level as did Jeremy Cameron who is the only multiple goal-kicker on the ground. GWS are looking to snap a two match losing streak and climb up to fourth on the ladder while Richmond need the four points to hold off the pack of contenders bunching behind them on the fringes of the eight. Wimbledon: The final Saturday at Wimbledon wasn\u2019t only about the ladies\u2019 singles final. Dylan Alcott made sure his name was once again in lights after securing his fourth straight grand slam title. The Logie winner made sure his latest ornament would be put to good use. It sounds weird but I like using the trophy. You get a Tiffany crystal vase at the US Open. Why not put delicious, beautiful flowers in it, like we do? We actually use them. And it\u2019s cool. Then they\u2019re around the house. You don\u2019t look like as much of a wanker as well. Wimbledon: Williams was magnanimous in defeat, conceding she just came up against a better player on the day. I can\u2019t say that I had a lot of tension or was super tense, I just think my opponent played unbelievable. When someone plays lights out, there\u2019s really not much you can do. You just have to understand that it was their day. There\u2019s so many impressive things about her. Her tenacity, her ability to improve every time, just to keep improving. Her ability to find power. You can\u2019t underestimate her. She\u2019s like a little powerhouse. For her part, the champion said she had never played better. It would be a surprise to learn anybody had ever played better. Here\u2019s some images from Centre Court if you\u2019d like to see Halep\u2019s name on the honours board. Wimbledon: The biggest story from overnight is all about Simona Halep and her extraordinary demolition of Serena Williams in the ladies\u2019 singles final at Wimbledon. The seventh seed, renowned as a clay court specialist, barely made an error during her 6-2 6-2 triumph, one that secured the second grand slam of her career and left Williams still agonisingly short of equalling Margaret Court\u2019s all-time record of 24. Sean Ingle was courtside to savour all the action. Watching on it seemed impossible that when Halep was a young child in Romania she used to cry before going on to court because she was so shy. Yet on the game\u2019s biggest stage the tiny introvert was transformed into a lion with ice in her veins, producing a near-faultless display to dismantle the greatest women\u2019s player in history. AFL: There will be some serious questions asked of the GWS medical staff following Coniglio\u2019s early departure from the game. AFL: QT: Richmond 4.4 (28) v GWS 0.2 (2) - It is bitterly cold, wet and windy in Melbourne today and they\u2019re just the highlights of GWS\u2019s trip down south. Richmond smashed them in the opening quarter, one that began with Stephen Coniglio limping from the field after appearing to aggravate a knee injury that threatened to rule him out of the contest to begin with. Moving on to the positives, Sydney Stack continues to demonstrate he\u2019s among the most exciting prospects in the competition. Hello everybody and welcome to another action-packed edition of Sunday sportwatch. In terms of live action this afternoon we\u2019re all about the footy with the AFL and NRL to the fore. In the AFL finals contenders Richmond and GWS began their duel at 1.10pm so we\u2019ll check in on that shortly before turning our attention to Western Bulldogs v Melbourne (3.20pm) and Port Adelaide v Brisbane (4.40pm). Our NRL action began at 2pm with the Roosters hosting the Cowboys, continues with the Tigers and Eels at 4.05pm and concludes with the Raiders visiting the Dragons from 6.10pm. But that is only a fraction of what we\u2019ll get through today after such a bumper night of sport around the world last night and another one in store tonight. That means we\u2019ll check-in on Wimbledon, the British F1 Grand Prix, the Netball World Cup, and whatever else catches our eye.

Partially organised by word of mouth, partially through WhatsApp, we have arrived ready at the meeting point \u2013 the bottom of a windmill famous for featuring in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/chitty-chitty-bang-bang\" title=\"\">Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</a></em>.</p> <p>It\u2019s a friendly, chatty, hotchpotch crowd.

By contrast, there are just 40 groups for walkers over 40.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'People want to get away from the hustle and bustle of an increasingly frenetic daily life in the city'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Social media undeniably creates homophilous bubbles, but the cultural shift has been perceptible \u2013 Instagram is filled with photos of beautiful craggy coastlines taken by an array of young, part-time hedonists, part-time hikers. My own feed features a fashion editor friend who spent her last pre-baby holiday climbing the peaks of Mallorca. A former editor of Vice at her happiest scaling Devil\u2019s Dyke.

More memories, fewer hangovers. \u201cThe attraction has especially grown in the last decade,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause people want to get away from the hustle and bustle of an increasingly frenetic daily life in the city. Everyone is surrounded by technology and \u2018on\u2019 all the time; getting outdoors is a chance to put that down and reconnect with nature. It\u2019s a mental escape as much as a physical one \u2013 and it\u2019s good for you.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lauradoling/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Laura Do</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lauradoling/?hl=en\" title=\"\">ling</a>, 25, is a keen champion. \u201cEveryone talks about mental health a lot, but I think, massively for young people, it\u2019s a great outlet to be in the hills in solitude,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else becomes insignificant when I\u2019m walking; the world carries on and it slows everything down.\u201d Doling grew up in Jaywick, Essex, which is regularly named as one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/30/jaywick-tops-list-most-deprived-english-neighbourhoods\" title=\"\">most deprived towns in Britain</a>.

An IT project manager from Sheffield, Hardy quit her job and sold her house to walk, trek, ramble and mountaineer full time. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much sold all my stuff or given it away and kept a few sentimental items at my mum\u2019s. I drive around in my estate car and have everything I need; I\u2019m 34 and I\u2019ve never felt happier.\u201d By flagging up her walks on Instagram, Hardy has forged a community of young walkers who regularly organise expeditions and learn from one another. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone who was awkward or not friendly and I\u2019ve made so many lifelong friends.\u201d</p> <p><strong>T</strong>hat walking is meditative and healing is no secret. Where Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson offered literary treatises on its transcendental properties, scientific studies have confirmed that spending time outdoors in green spaces is good for you. Last month a paper published in the journal <em>Scientific </em><em>Reports</em> found that people who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/13/two-hour-dose-nature-weekly-boosts-health-study-finds\" title=\"\">spend two hours</a> a week or more outdoors reported a greater sense of wellbeing. The month before, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/may/13/woodland-walks-good-for-mind-and-body-studies-show\" title=\"\">Forestry England compiled data</a> from a string of studies to prove that being around trees improves mood and attention span, and enhances stress recovery. News that walking in nature aids creativity is not new.

      "bodyText": "Deep in the English countryside on a golden midsummer evening, 16 young people have gathered to plot the night\u2019s entertainment. Partially organised by word of mouth, partially through WhatsApp, we have arrived ready at the meeting point \u2013 the bottom of a windmill famous for featuring in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. It\u2019s a friendly, chatty, hotchpotch crowd. If I squint, I think this might just be how the halcyon days of rave first came about. It might \u2013 except that I\u2019m here with the Berkshire Young Ramblers and we\u2019re going on a five-mile hike. Walking, I mumble unconvincingly, is the new raving ... isn\u2019t it? Last year the trend forecasters WGSN predicted that hiking would become the biggest new fitness trend of 2019. Buoyed by fashion houses including Gucci and Louis Vuitton putting walking boots on the catwalk and a proliferation of young models \u2013 your Hadids and Jenners \u2013 posing in Californian canyons, style blogs declared hiking to be so hot right now. That may have come as news for anyone spending their lifetime using their feet unfashionably, but the stats bear it out: while going out-out has undergone a generational decline, going to the great outdoors has seen a marked uptick among millennials. The Ramblers, the UK walking charity best known for attracting an older demographic, counts more than 50 groups nationwide for people in their 20s and 30s \u2013 and they are growing rapidly; the Glasgow Young Walkers\u2019 membership increased by 28% at the start of 2019 and the Stag Walkers\u2019 (covering Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire) by 14% in the same period. By contrast, there are just 40 groups for walkers over 40. Social media undeniably creates homophilous bubbles, but the cultural shift has been perceptible \u2013 Instagram is filled with photos of beautiful craggy coastlines taken by an array of young, part-time hedonists, part-time hikers. My own feed features a fashion editor friend who spent her last pre-baby holiday climbing the peaks of Mallorca. A former editor of Vice at her happiest scaling Devil\u2019s Dyke. Music journalists on mountains. An artist documenting their wild desert walks. A twentysomething club kid besotted with the Jurassic coast. My own amateur adventures into nature have become so frequent in the last three years that I\u2019ve set up a separate Instagram account just to stop spamming my friends with endless postcards of endless vistas. User research confirms that walking has become a widespread hobby. \u201cPeople have been coming to Pinterest for inspiration, for making sure they\u2019re fully equipped for their treks,\u201d says Larkin Brown, a spokesperson for the social media network. Searches on Pinterest for \u201chiking equipment\u201d have increased by 38% in the last 12 months, while \u201chiking outfit\u201d has jumped by 44%. \u201cPeople are using the platform to plan ideas for their routes \u2013 searches for \u2018walking trails\u2019 have leapt by 50%,\u201d adds Brown. Chris Lines, who has more than 20 years\u2019 experience working with the outdoor brand Berghaus and the It\u2019s Great Out There Coalition, says the surge of interest in the outdoors ties into broader consumer trends: we want experiences rather than more stuff. More memories, fewer hangovers. \u201cThe attraction has especially grown in the last decade,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause people want to get away from the hustle and bustle of an increasingly frenetic daily life in the city. Everyone is surrounded by technology and \u2018on\u2019 all the time; getting outdoors is a chance to put that down and reconnect with nature. It\u2019s a mental escape as much as a physical one \u2013 and it\u2019s good for you.\u201d Laura Doling, 25, is a keen champion. \u201cEveryone talks about mental health a lot, but I think, massively for young people, it\u2019s a great outlet to be in the hills in solitude,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything else becomes insignificant when I\u2019m walking; the world carries on and it slows everything down.\u201d Doling grew up in Jaywick, Essex, which is regularly named as one of the most deprived towns in Britain. She graduated with a first in sports science and worked in healthcare before quitting to become a Royal Mail postwoman. After finding a community of like-minded young adventurers on Instagram, she engineered a job transfer to the Lake District and now spends all day walking the fells. Her following online includes brands keen to use her influence to encourage more young people to explore nature and get active. \u201cI did the clubbing scene,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy, and I think it\u2019s a waste of money. I can go out at a weekend and camp out in the hills, where you sit and have a decent conversation. It takes away from the superficial problem of worrying what you look like or what you\u2019re wearing.\u201d Doling\u2019s friend Nic Hardy, who describes herself as Instagram\u2019s hiking social secretary, agrees. An IT project manager from Sheffield, Hardy quit her job and sold her house to walk, trek, ramble and mountaineer full time. \u201cI\u2019ve pretty much sold all my stuff or given it away and kept a few sentimental items at my mum\u2019s. I drive around in my estate car and have everything I need; I\u2019m 34 and I\u2019ve never felt happier.\u201d By flagging up her walks on Instagram, Hardy has forged a community of young walkers who regularly organise expeditions and learn from one another. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever met anyone who was awkward or not friendly and I\u2019ve made so many lifelong friends.\u201d That walking is meditative and healing is no secret. Where Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson offered literary treatises on its transcendental properties, scientific studies have confirmed that spending time outdoors in green spaces is good for you. Last month a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports found that people who spend two hours a week or more outdoors reported a greater sense of wellbeing. The month before, Forestry England compiled data from a string of studies to prove that being around trees improves mood and attention span, and enhances stress recovery. News that walking in nature aids creativity is not new. The challenge is to get more people to realise that it\u2019s easy \u2013 and belongs to everyone. \u201cThe industry is waking up to the fact that it needs to look and feel more inclusive and a lot more could and should be done,\u201d says Lines. \u201cEspecially as the barrier to entry is so low \u2013 you just need to go out for a walk. There are no costs to that.\u201d After all, you can only be what you can see and, subconsciously, plenty of us have grown up in families assuming that outdoor adventuring is, well, for white people. To that end, Lines works to lobby for grants to fund projects \u201cdesigned to give young people a lifelong love of the outdoors, reaching diverse communities that haven\u2019t traditionally been targeted\u201d. Berghaus, he says, already does some of this work. Meanwhile The North Face has established an \u201cExplore Fund \u2026 to create access and equity in the outdoors\u201d. Back in the Chilterns, the Berkshire crew enthusiastically amble through stunning hills before finishing up at a village pub. Their membership has swollen by 30% in the last year, helped by younger walkers encouraged by the ease of advice available online. But organised group walking isn\u2019t for everyone.

That began with Thomas Voeckler\u2019s lengthy \u2013 and hugely popular \u2013 spell in the yellow jersey in 2011 and continued with Pinot\u2019s mountain stage win at Porrentruy the following year at the tender age of 22. In 2014, he finished third overall and with Jean-Christophe P\u00e9raud second to Vincenzo Nibali, there were two Frenchmen on the podium for the first time since Fignon and Hinault in 1984.</p> <p>Since then, however, in spite of a prestigious stage victory at L\u2019Alpe d\u2019Huez in 2015, Pinot has struggled to mount a sustained challenge in the Tour, with French hopes largely resting on the slender shoulders of Romain Bardet, who finished second and third to Chris Froome in 2016 and 2017 respectively, but does not look like this year\u2019s man after a poor showing on Thursday.</p> <p>Pinot turned to targeting the Giro d\u2019Italia, largely to escape the relentless media attention that the Tour entails. He has been plagued by ill health and gained a reputation as a man who can catch any virus that might be doing the rounds.</p> <p>Alaphilippe has also had his issues \u2013 glandular fever, a knee operation \u2013 but he seems physically and mentally more robust than Pinot, whose display of frustration during a cobbled stage in 2015 remains a defining image.</p> <p>When the tide runs his way, Pinot looks more than strong enough, as he did at the end of last year when he won two stages in the Tour of Spain and the Giro di Lombardia. So far in this Tour it has all gone his way. While Bardet\u2019s AG2R squad flopped, the Groupama-FDJ team performed above expectations in the first Sunday\u2019s team time trial, putting him on the front foot immediately, and this was followed by a strong showing behind the victorious Alaphilippe in \u00c9pernay, where he gained five seconds on Thomas. Slender pickings, but it gave him an advantage. His young, talented climbing teammate David Gaudu is also in sparkling form.</p> <p>With his parents looking on, the sheer brute force Pinot displayed on his local finish at La Planche des Belles Filles would not have disgraced Hinault. If he keeps that up he could press Thomas hard in the next 10 days, even if he does not manage to replicate the Badger\u2019s success in 1985, the last home winner of the Tour.</p>",

Since then, however, in spite of a prestigious stage victory at L\u2019Alpe d\u2019Huez in 2015, Pinot has struggled to mount a sustained challenge in the Tour, with French hopes largely resting on the slender shoulders of Romain Bardet, who finished second and third to Chris Froome in 2016 and 2017 respectively, but does not look like this year\u2019s man after a poor showing on Thursday. Pinot turned to targeting the Giro d\u2019Italia, largely to escape the relentless media attention that the Tour entails. He has been plagued by ill health and gained a reputation as a man who can catch any virus that might be doing the rounds. Alaphilippe has also had his issues \u2013 glandular fever, a knee operation \u2013 but he seems physically and mentally more robust than Pinot, whose display of frustration during a cobbled stage in 2015 remains a defining image. When the tide runs his way, Pinot looks more than strong enough, as he did at the end of last year when he won two stages in the Tour of Spain and the Giro di Lombardia. So far in this Tour it has all gone his way. While Bardet\u2019s AG2R squad flopped, the Groupama-FDJ team performed above expectations in the first Sunday\u2019s team time trial, putting him on the front foot immediately, and this was followed by a strong showing behind the victorious Alaphilippe in \u00c9pernay, where he gained five seconds on Thomas. Slender pickings, but it gave him an advantage. His young, talented climbing teammate David Gaudu is also in sparkling form. With his parents looking on, the sheer brute force Pinot displayed on his local finish at La Planche des Belles Filles would not have disgraced Hinault. If he keeps that up he could press Thomas hard in the next 10 days, even if he does not manage to replicate the Badger\u2019s success in 1985, the last home winner of the Tour.",

A certain weariness had set in. Is this the end of wellness?</p> <p>The evidence: \u201cI was a huge fan of Gwyneth,\u201d one attendee of Goop\u2019s recent \u201cwellness summit\u201d in London told website Page Six, \u201cNow I feel like I have lost my faith in God.\u201d \u201cGP [Paltrow],\u201d said another, \u201cis a fucking extortionist.\u201d These were people who had spent up to \u00a34,500 on weekend tickets, getting off the tube in Hammersmith as if landing in Lourdes, expecting to leave healed. What do they need healing from, you ask? Well, what have you got? Creepy energy, deep thirst, smell of cardboard, troubled pits, babyish sleeping, bad vagina \u2013 the beauty of the term \u201cwellness\u201d is that it encompasses almost everything, and can cost almost anything. Which is why I was excited to see the attendees rebel \u2013 a tipping point has been reached.

A certain weariness had set in. Is this the end of wellness? The evidence: \u201cI was a huge fan of Gwyneth,\u201d one attendee of Goop\u2019s recent \u201cwellness summit\u201d in London told website Page Six, \u201cNow I feel like I have lost my faith in God.\u201d \u201cGP [Paltrow],\u201d said another, \u201cis a fucking extortionist.\u201d These were people who had spent up to \u00a34,500 on weekend tickets, getting off the tube in Hammersmith as if landing in Lourdes, expecting to leave healed. What do they need healing from, you ask? Well, what have you got? Creepy energy, deep thirst, smell of cardboard, troubled pits, babyish sleeping, bad vagina \u2013 the beauty of the term \u201cwellness\u201d is that it encompasses almost everything, and can cost almost anything.

      "body": "<p>For Eileen O\u2019Sullivan, being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 was the catalyst for a deluge of distinctly unscientific and frequently dangerous advice. An investment manager with a analytical mind, she began seeking information to better understand her potentially life-altering condition. But from the moment Eileen starting searching online, misinformation was unavoidable: \u201cThis is when all the suggestions start rolling in,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore diagnosis, I had never heard of crank treatments for cancer: herbs, supplements, diets, juicing, clean eating, homeopathy, essential oils, nor adverts for overseas alternative cancer clinics. I certainly didn\u2019t go looking for them, but I got endless prompts based on keywords such as breast cancer. I was also inundated with relatives and friends coming out with crackpot therapies \u2013 and even from other patients in chemo wards and waiting rooms.\u201d</p> <p>As a cancer researcher deeply involved in science outreach, I can attest that few subjects provoke quite the emotional response that cancer does. There is not a family in the world untouched by the disease, and the word itself is enough to induce a sense of fear in even the hardiest among us. Cancer is oppressive and all-pervasive: <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\" title=\"\">half of us alive today</a> will experience a direct brush with it. But despite its ubiquity, it remains poorly understood and falsehoods around it can thrive. </p> <p>Online, dubious claims about cancer are rife, from outright \u201ccures\u201d to assertions of a conspiracy to suppress \u201cthe truth\u201d about it. In <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/fake-news-health-facebook-cruel-damaging-social-media-mike-adams-natural-health-ranger-conspiracy-a7498201.html\" title=\"\">2016, more than half of the 20 most shared cancer articles on Facebook</a> consisted of medically discredited claims. And this goes far beyond Facebook \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-youtube-overrun-with-bogus-cancer-treatment-claims-11562072401\" title=\"\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> recently revealed that YouTube was hosting accounts with thousands of subscribers that promoted bogus cancer treatments. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s scepticism gave her some immunity to the lure of empty promises. But having lost her mother to breast cancer, \u201cfear left me more vulnerable to pseudoscience than I would care to admit\u201d, she says.</p> <p>She is now a passionate patient advocate, steering others away from damaging falsehoods \u2013 a problem she sees as unrelenting. This grim assessment chimes with the observations made by Dr Robert O\u2019Connor of the Irish Cancer Society: \u201cPractically all patients are exposed to misinformation, [coming] from well-meaning but misinformed loved ones to a plethora of exploitative and profiteering sources on social media\u201d.</p> <p>A quick web search reveals ostensible treatments ranging from the vaguely scientific-sounding to the profoundly esoteric. The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) non-exhaustive list of debunked claims numbers <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/products-claiming-cure-cancer-are-cruel-deception\" title=\"\">more than 187</a>, while <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unproven_and_disproven_cancer_treatments\" title=\"\">Wikipedia\u2019s </a>list of bogus cures run from \u201cenergy-based\u201d to \u201cspiritual healing\u201d. Other claims involve <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy/about/pac-20394380\" title=\"\">hyperbaric oxygen therapy,</a> <a href=\"https://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2012/07/25/cannabis-cannabinoids-and-cancer-the-evidence-so-far/\" title=\"\">cannabis oil</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/30/six-stubborn-myths-cancer\" title=\"\">shark cartilage,</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2017/jan/24/cancer-treatment-myths-clean-eating-cannabis-homeopathy-alternative\" title=\"\">ketogenic diets and baking soda</a>.</p> <p>There is increasing concern that such fictions risk eclipsing reputable information. Macmillan Cancer Support recently <a href=\"https://www.macmillan.org.uk/aboutus/news/latest_news/cancer-charity-appoints-digital-nurse-to-combat-fake-news-online.aspx\" title=\"\">appointed a nurse specifically to debunk online stories</a>, prompting <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(18)30610-7/fulltext\" title=\"\">the <em>Lancet Oncology</em></a> to comment: \u201cHow has society got to this point, where unproven interventions are being chosen in preference to evidence-based, effective treatments? Unfortunately, disinformation and \u2013 frankly \u2013 lies are widely propagated and with the same magnitude as verified evidence.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are dismissed by charlatans as poisons, imperilling lives</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Similar concerns are echoed by <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2018-04-26-belief-in-fake-causes-of-cancer-is-rife-0\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/wellcome-launches-research-investigate-fake-health-news-social-media/digital/article/1488400\" title=\"\">Wellcome Trust</a>. New patients in particular are often targeted by those pushing cancer \u201ccures\u201d, and while some of these are well meaning but misguided, others are commercially driven. Sonya Canavan, another cancer survivor, noted: \u201cIn the breast cancer patient forum I used to post on, I often saw \u2018patients\u2019 posting about all kinds of quackery, who turned out to be salespeople trawling for business.\u201d</p> <p>That pseudoscience is being hawked to vulnerable patients isn\u2019t a new problem \u2013 cancer scams have existed for decades, and combating them was the impetus behind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancer_Act_1939\" title=\"\">1939 Cancer Act</a>. The substantial difference now is the ease with which falsehoods can be disseminated. Cancer surgeon David Gorski, professor of surgery and oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan and managing editor of the online journal <em>Science-Based Medicine</em>, notes that cancer misinformation is \u201cway more prevalent now for the same reason other misinformation and conspiracy theories are so prevalent \u2013 because they\u2019re so easily spread on social media.\u201d </p> <p>Whether born out of a desire to help, or naked charlatanism, the net impact of such misinformation is overwhelmingly negative. Patients engaged with unproved treatments for cancer are more likely to reject conventional treatment, or delay life-saving interventions. This comes at a terrible cost; patients who subscribe to alternative approaches are <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/article-abstract/2687972\" title=\"\">more than twice as likely to die</a> in the same period as those who rely on conventional therapies. Worse again, it is not uncommon for promoters of dubious information to resort to scaremongering over conventional therapy. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are frequently dismissed as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/aug/30/six-stubborn-myths-cancer\" title=\"\">poisons</a>\u201d, imperilling lives. Cancer is frightening, and promises of simple cures can be alluring. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"671e22db51c44cfe90e6a6933e8ae2b8e2110746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/671e22db51c44cfe90e6a6933e8ae2b8e2110746/0_0_2000_1392/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stanislaw Burzynski in 1997\" width=\"1000\" height=\"696\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stanislaw Burzynski in 1997 at the federal courthouse in Houston, Texas, where he faced 34 charges of mail fraud, which were dismissed, and 41 of violating FDA regulations, upon which the jury failed to reach a verdict.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pat Sullivan/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All false claims betray the same basic misunderstanding, however: cancer is not a monolithic entity, but a family of more than <a href=\"https://www.aacrfoundation.org/Pages/what-is-cancer.aspx\" title=\"\">200 known diseases</a>. Arising from mutations in a patient\u2019s cells, cancer is extremely <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)81683-9?\" title=\"\">complex and diverse</a>. It is highly unlikely that a single \u201cmagic bullet\u201d could treat cancer in all its forms. The idea of a panacea is attractive, but woefully misguided, and a klaxon warning of dubious science. Unscientific interventions can nevertheless come with substantial price tags. </p> <p>Based in his Texas clinic, Stanislaw Burzynski claims to cure cancer with a unique \u201cantineoplaston\u201d therapy. Despite operating for decades, according to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) \u201cother investigators have been unable to duplicate these results\u201d. Since its inception, the clinic has been the subject of numerous FDA warnings yet continues to promote itself as capable of curing patients. And it does not come cheap \u2013 the US NCI warns patients that treatment costs upwards of $7,500-$10,000 monthly (\u00a35,600-\u00a37,580) and says: \u201cThe evidence for use of antineoplaston therapy as a treatment for cancer is inconclusive. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to assess the value of this therapy.\u201d</p> <p>Despite negative publicity, it\u2019s business as usual for Burzynski. If anything, crowdfunding may have made his clinic more popular. In lieu of scientific evidence, it relies on gushing testimonials to lure new customers, though in some cases, these come from <a href=\"https://theotherburzynskipatientgroup.wordpress.com/tag/burzynski-clinic/\" title=\"\">patients already deceased</a> \u2013 a fact absent from the promotional material.</p> <p>This is contemptible, but in no way unique \u2013 there is an abundance of dubious clinics worldwide promising the impossible at eye-watering prices. Last year an <a href=\"https://www.rte.ie/news/primetime/2018/1109/1009830-prime-time-desperate-decisions/\" title=\"\">investigation on Irish television</a> probed clinics in Istanbul that were claiming huge successes with unconventional therapies. Patients were charged more than \u20ac130,000 (\u00a3116,000) and given the all-clear in Turkey. According to the programme, patients discovered their cancers had progressed markedly when scanned after returning home. Germany, too, is home to several effectively unregulated clinics, presented as luxury spas but promising cures. These are backed by fawning testimonials pitched at international customers, with treatments costing hundreds of thousands of euros \u2013 <a href=\"https://edzardernst.com/2018/07/germany-the-promised-land-for-cancer-quacks/\" title=\"\">despite no evidence</a> for their efficacy. </p> <p>Such exploitation goes far beyond the immediate victims, with crowdfunding typically used to meet their exorbitant prices. A <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3829\" title=\"\">paper in the <em>British Medical Journal</em></a> last year, based on figures collected by the Good Thinking Society, found that at least \u00a38m had been raised since 2012 in the UK alone for unsubstantiated or discredited cancer treatments. As Good Thinking Society project director Michael Marshall explains: \u201cSums raised through crowdfunding are just the tip of the iceberg, with many patients taking out loans, mortgaging their houses, and spending their life savings. When these supposed cures turn out to offer no benefit, families have been left coping with huge debts when they are grieving for their loved one.\u201d</p> <p>To explain the paucity of evidence for their claims, purveyors of quack remedies accuse the medical and scientific community of suppressing cures for cancer. This is not a mere fringe belief \u2013 <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1835348\" title=\"\">37% of Americans believe the FDA</a> is doing just that. But the claim is nonsense. It would require a vast conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors to sustain \u2013 a <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0147905\" title=\"\">scenario unlikely to endure</a>.</p> <p>Plus, if there were such a conspiracy, wouldn\u2019t those who work in the cancer sphere be just as susceptible to its malignant influence as anyone? <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/the-vulnerable-must-be-protected-from-bogus-cancer-cures-1.3869314\" title=\"\">We all lose loved ones to cancer, and succumb to it</a>.

Arguing is a fool\u2019s errand | Ranjana Srivastava</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The rise in cancer misinformation is part of a wider problem with online falsehoods.

In a sea of sound and fury, discerning between the reputable and the repugnant isn\u2019t always easy, but there are excellent resources available for patients and their families. Well-researched guides by <a href=\"https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/your-cancer-guide\" title=\"\">Cancer Research UK</a> and the US <a href=\"https://www.cancer.gov/resources-for/patients\" title=\"\">National Cancer Institute</a> are enlightening and authoritative. </p> <p>Like anti-vaccine sentiment, cancer myths thrive on social media. There is a strong argument that these platforms have a moral obligation to remove groups and individuals propagating misinformation. As O\u2019Sullivan notes, \u201cFacebook, YouTube and Twitter lead a patient down a rabbit hole, with many thinking this is \u2018doing their research\u2019. I don\u2019t think we can stop those making false cancer claims, but maybe we can insulate patients and regulate those making cancer claims as well as holding social media platforms accountable.\u201d</p> <p>In the wake of a measles resurgence driven in part by online anti-vaccine activism, several social media platforms have promised to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-pledged-crackdown-on-vaccine-misinformation-then-not-much-happened-11559243847\" title=\"\">massage their algorithms</a> to reduce \u201cfake news\u201d on cancer. But this filtering is easily bypassed. Social media business models thrive on engagement rather than veracity, and a cynic might think they have little reason to regulate such content, beyond appearing to be concerned.

      "bodyText": "For Eileen O\u2019Sullivan, being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 was the catalyst for a deluge of distinctly unscientific and frequently dangerous advice. An investment manager with a analytical mind, she began seeking information to better understand her potentially life-altering condition. But from the moment Eileen starting searching online, misinformation was unavoidable: \u201cThis is when all the suggestions start rolling in,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore diagnosis, I had never heard of crank treatments for cancer: herbs, supplements, diets, juicing, clean eating, homeopathy, essential oils, nor adverts for overseas alternative cancer clinics. I certainly didn\u2019t go looking for them, but I got endless prompts based on keywords such as breast cancer. I was also inundated with relatives and friends coming out with crackpot therapies \u2013 and even from other patients in chemo wards and waiting rooms.\u201d As a cancer researcher deeply involved in science outreach, I can attest that few subjects provoke quite the emotional response that cancer does. There is not a family in the world untouched by the disease, and the word itself is enough to induce a sense of fear in even the hardiest among us. Cancer is oppressive and all-pervasive: half of us alive today will experience a direct brush with it. But despite its ubiquity, it remains poorly understood and falsehoods around it can thrive. Online, dubious claims about cancer are rife, from outright \u201ccures\u201d to assertions of a conspiracy to suppress \u201cthe truth\u201d about it. In 2016, more than half of the 20 most shared cancer articles on Facebook consisted of medically discredited claims. And this goes far beyond Facebook \u2013 the Wall Street Journal recently revealed that YouTube was hosting accounts with thousands of subscribers that promoted bogus cancer treatments. O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s scepticism gave her some immunity to the lure of empty promises. But having lost her mother to breast cancer, \u201cfear left me more vulnerable to pseudoscience than I would care to admit\u201d, she says. She is now a passionate patient advocate, steering others away from damaging falsehoods \u2013 a problem she sees as unrelenting. This grim assessment chimes with the observations made by Dr Robert O\u2019Connor of the Irish Cancer Society: \u201cPractically all patients are exposed to misinformation, [coming] from well-meaning but misinformed loved ones to a plethora of exploitative and profiteering sources on social media\u201d. A quick web search reveals ostensible treatments ranging from the vaguely scientific-sounding to the profoundly esoteric. The US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) non-exhaustive list of debunked claims numbers more than 187, while Wikipedia\u2019s list of bogus cures run from \u201cenergy-based\u201d to \u201cspiritual healing\u201d. Other claims involve hyperbaric oxygen therapy, cannabis oil, shark cartilage, ketogenic diets and baking soda. There is increasing concern that such fictions risk eclipsing reputable information. Macmillan Cancer Support recently appointed a nurse specifically to debunk online stories, prompting the Lancet Oncology to comment: \u201cHow has society got to this point, where unproven interventions are being chosen in preference to evidence-based, effective treatments? Unfortunately, disinformation and \u2013 frankly \u2013 lies are widely propagated and with the same magnitude as verified evidence.\u201d Similar concerns are echoed by Cancer Research UK as well as the Wellcome Trust. New patients in particular are often targeted by those pushing cancer \u201ccures\u201d, and while some of these are well meaning but misguided, others are commercially driven. Sonya Canavan, another cancer survivor, noted: \u201cIn the breast cancer patient forum I used to post on, I often saw \u2018patients\u2019 posting about all kinds of quackery, who turned out to be salespeople trawling for business.\u201d That pseudoscience is being hawked to vulnerable patients isn\u2019t a new problem \u2013 cancer scams have existed for decades, and combating them was the impetus behind the 1939 Cancer Act. The substantial difference now is the ease with which falsehoods can be disseminated. Cancer surgeon David Gorski, professor of surgery and oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan and managing editor of the online journal Science-Based Medicine, notes that cancer misinformation is \u201cway more prevalent now for the same reason other misinformation and conspiracy theories are so prevalent \u2013 because they\u2019re so easily spread on social media.\u201d Whether born out of a desire to help, or naked charlatanism, the net impact of such misinformation is overwhelmingly negative. Patients engaged with unproved treatments for cancer are more likely to reject conventional treatment, or delay life-saving interventions. This comes at a terrible cost; patients who subscribe to alternative approaches are more than twice as likely to die in the same period as those who rely on conventional therapies. Worse again, it is not uncommon for promoters of dubious information to resort to scaremongering over conventional therapy. Both radiotherapy and chemotherapy are frequently dismissed as \u201cpoisons\u201d, imperilling lives. Cancer is frightening, and promises of simple cures can be alluring. All false claims betray the same basic misunderstanding, however: cancer is not a monolithic entity, but a family of more than 200 known diseases. Arising from mutations in a patient\u2019s cells, cancer is extremely complex and diverse. It is highly unlikely that a single \u201cmagic bullet\u201d could treat cancer in all its forms. The idea of a panacea is attractive, but woefully misguided, and a klaxon warning of dubious science. Unscientific interventions can nevertheless come with substantial price tags. Based in his Texas clinic, Stanislaw Burzynski claims to cure cancer with a unique \u201cantineoplaston\u201d therapy. Despite operating for decades, according to the US National Cancer Institute (NCI) \u201cother investigators have been unable to duplicate these results\u201d. Since its inception, the clinic has been the subject of numerous FDA warnings yet continues to promote itself as capable of curing patients. And it does not come cheap \u2013 the US NCI warns patients that treatment costs upwards of $7,500-$10,000 monthly (\u00a35,600-\u00a37,580) and says: \u201cThe evidence for use of antineoplaston therapy as a treatment for cancer is inconclusive. Controlled clinical trials are necessary to assess the value of this therapy.\u201d Despite negative publicity, it\u2019s business as usual for Burzynski. If anything, crowdfunding may have made his clinic more popular. In lieu of scientific evidence, it relies on gushing testimonials to lure new customers, though in some cases, these come from patients already deceased \u2013 a fact absent from the promotional material. This is contemptible, but in no way unique \u2013 there is an abundance of dubious clinics worldwide promising the impossible at eye-watering prices. Last year an investigation on Irish television probed clinics in Istanbul that were claiming huge successes with unconventional therapies. Patients were charged more than \u20ac130,000 (\u00a3116,000) and given the all-clear in Turkey. According to the programme, patients discovered their cancers had progressed markedly when scanned after returning home. Germany, too, is home to several effectively unregulated clinics, presented as luxury spas but promising cures. These are backed by fawning testimonials pitched at international customers, with treatments costing hundreds of thousands of euros \u2013 despite no evidence for their efficacy. Such exploitation goes far beyond the immediate victims, with crowdfunding typically used to meet their exorbitant prices. A paper in the British Medical Journal last year, based on figures collected by the Good Thinking Society, found that at least \u00a38m had been raised since 2012 in the UK alone for unsubstantiated or discredited cancer treatments. As Good Thinking Society project director Michael Marshall explains: \u201cSums raised through crowdfunding are just the tip of the iceberg, with many patients taking out loans, mortgaging their houses, and spending their life savings. When these supposed cures turn out to offer no benefit, families have been left coping with huge debts when they are grieving for their loved one.\u201d To explain the paucity of evidence for their claims, purveyors of quack remedies accuse the medical and scientific community of suppressing cures for cancer. This is not a mere fringe belief \u2013 37% of Americans believe the FDA is doing just that. But the claim is nonsense. It would require a vast conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of scientists and doctors to sustain \u2013 a scenario unlikely to endure. Plus, if there were such a conspiracy, wouldn\u2019t those who work in the cancer sphere be just as susceptible to its malignant influence as anyone? We all lose loved ones to cancer, and succumb to it. Conspiracy claims foster distrust between patients and healthcare teams. The rise in cancer misinformation is part of a wider problem with online falsehoods. Like the equally dangerous explosion in anti-vaccine myths, cancer untruths have an impact on both our physical wellbeing and on the public understanding of science and medicine. In a sea of sound and fury, discerning between the reputable and the repugnant isn\u2019t always easy, but there are excellent resources available for patients and their families. Well-researched guides by Cancer Research UK and the US National Cancer Institute are enlightening and authoritative. Like anti-vaccine sentiment, cancer myths thrive on social media. There is a strong argument that these platforms have a moral obligation to remove groups and individuals propagating misinformation. As O\u2019Sullivan notes, \u201cFacebook, YouTube and Twitter lead a patient down a rabbit hole, with many thinking this is \u2018doing their research\u2019. I don\u2019t think we can stop those making false cancer claims, but maybe we can insulate patients and regulate those making cancer claims as well as holding social media platforms accountable.\u201d In the wake of a measles resurgence driven in part by online anti-vaccine activism, several social media platforms have promised to massage their algorithms to reduce \u201cfake news\u201d on cancer. But this filtering is easily bypassed. Social media business models thrive on engagement rather than veracity, and a cynic might think they have little reason to regulate such content, beyond appearing to be concerned. Whether the problem is absence of ability or inclination, health misinformation remains widespread. It\u2019s imperative we improve our ability to assess the avalanche of medical claims: our continued wellbeing depends on it.

But the tombs turned out to be completely empty, creating yet another mystery over the whereabouts of the dead princesses.</p> <p>The Vatican pledged further investigation and on Saturday a spokesman said they had \u201cidentified two ossuaries, located under the pavement of an area inside the Pontifical Teutonic College, covered by a manhole\u201d.</p> <p>He said the area had been sealed off and would be opened for forensic experts to investigate this week.</p> <p>The last recorded structural work at the college and its cemetery was in the 1960s and 70s. Orlandi disappeared in 1983 after leaving her family\u2019s Vatican City apartment to go to a music lesson in Rome. Her father was a lay employee of the Holy See. Over the years her disappearance has been linked to everything from the plot to kill Pope John Paul II to the financial scandal of the Vatican bank and Rome\u2019s criminal underworld. The last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Orlandi\u2019s remains as well. The search turned up no link.</p> <p>Last year bones were found underneath the Vatican\u2019s embassy to Italy in Rome. Italian media immediately speculated the remains could belong to Orlandi or another girl who went missing around the same time.

      "bodyText": "One of Rome\u2019s most enduring mysteries \u2013 the 1983 disappearance of 15-year-old Emanuela Orlandi, a Vatican employee\u2019s daughter \u2013 took a new twist on Saturday when papal authorities announced that they had discovered two sets of bones under a stone manhole. On Thursday the Vatican had pried open the tombs of two 19th-century German princesses in the cemetery of the Pontifical Teutonic College after Emanuela\u2019s family had received a tip that her remains might be buried there. But the tombs turned out to be completely empty, creating yet another mystery over the whereabouts of the dead princesses. The Vatican pledged further investigation and on Saturday a spokesman said they had \u201cidentified two ossuaries, located under the pavement of an area inside the Pontifical Teutonic College, covered by a manhole\u201d. He said the area had been sealed off and would be opened for forensic experts to investigate this week. The last recorded structural work at the college and its cemetery was in the 1960s and 70s. Orlandi disappeared in 1983 after leaving her family\u2019s Vatican City apartment to go to a music lesson in Rome. Her father was a lay employee of the Holy See. Over the years her disappearance has been linked to everything from the plot to kill Pope John Paul II to the financial scandal of the Vatican bank and Rome\u2019s criminal underworld. The last major twist in the case came in 2012, when forensic police exhumed the body of a reputed mobster from the crypt of a Roman basilica in hopes of finding Orlandi\u2019s remains as well. The search turned up no link. Last year bones were found underneath the Vatican\u2019s embassy to Italy in Rome. Italian media immediately speculated the remains could belong to Orlandi or another girl who went missing around the same time. But forensic tests showed the bones long pre-dated their disappearances.",

      "body": "<p>The innocence of youth was useful as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland. Padraig Harrington bears testament to that, even if an inquisitive nature took over eventually. As border checks and bombs reflected a grim way of life, Harrington was \u2013 in theory anyway \u2013 flirting with danger when travelling north from Dublin to participate in amateur championships. A journey that started as a teenager in 1987 will have travelled full circle by the time Harrington arrives at Royal Portrush for the 148th Open Championship that starts on Thursday.</p> <p>\u201cThere were four of us driving up to Warrenpoint to play a match and we were stopped on the road, there was a big tailback, an hour of traffic before we get to a soldier redirecting us on to a detour,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cThe driver was told: \u2018Ah, there is just a wee problem up the road.\u2019 On the news later there was a 500lb bomb on the road.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/10/rory-mcilroy-portrush-open-championship-golf\">Rory McIlroy takes comfort in familiarity of Portrush on Open return</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how when you get older, the books you read, you find out how the people who lived through that just became normalised by it. A 500lb bomb was a big deal to us but run\u2011of-the-mill or a \u2018wee problem\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Any sense that Harrington was scarred or jaundiced by such episodes would be wrong.

      "bodyText": "The innocence of youth was useful as the Troubles raged in Northern Ireland. Padraig Harrington bears testament to that, even if an inquisitive nature took over eventually. As border checks and bombs reflected a grim way of life, Harrington was \u2013 in theory anyway \u2013 flirting with danger when travelling north from Dublin to participate in amateur championships. A journey that started as a teenager in 1987 will have travelled full circle by the time Harrington arrives at Royal Portrush for the 148th Open Championship that starts on Thursday. \u201cThere were four of us driving up to Warrenpoint to play a match and we were stopped on the road, there was a big tailback, an hour of traffic before we get to a soldier redirecting us on to a detour,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cThe driver was told: \u2018Ah, there is just a wee problem up the road.\u2019 On the news later there was a 500lb bomb on the road. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how when you get older, the books you read, you find out how the people who lived through that just became normalised by it. A 500lb bomb was a big deal to us but run\u2011of-the-mill or a \u2018wee problem\u2019.\u201d Any sense that Harrington was scarred or jaundiced by such episodes would be wrong. When the two\u2011times Open champion arrives in Portrush for the final major of the year, there will be only fond memories. Harrington received respect and admiration in Northern Ireland as his golf blossomed. The feelings were quickly mutual. \u201cPeople coming up from the south had, how would I put it, a view of Northern Ireland and that was certainly not what I experienced,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think people could have been nicer. \u201cIn my situation playing golf, you just didn\u2019t see or know or be aware of anything beyond how nice people were.

      "bodyText": "The campaigner and businesswoman Gina Miller will launch immediate legal action to prevent Boris Johnson from shutting down parliament in order to drive through a no-deal Brexit against the wishes of MPs, the Observer can reveal. Miller\u2019s lawyers, Mishcon de Reya, have written to the likely next prime minister, saying that such a move would be not only \u201cconstitutionally unacceptable\u201d but also unlawful, and would lead them to mount an urgent challenge in the courts. Miller has assembled the same legal team, including the QCs Lord (David) Pannick and Tom Hickman, that successfully forced Theresa May in early 2017 to grant MPs a vote before triggering article 50, the process that set the clock ticking on the UK\u2019s exit from the EU. Her latest move will add to the drama as the country faces political and economic uncertainty with the approach of the latest Brexit deadline of 31 October. In a letter sent to Johnson, seen by the Observer, the team at Mishcon de Reya make clear that prorogation of parliament \u2013 something Johnson has repeatedly refused to rule out \u2013 would involve the use of prerogative powers, which courts would seek to limit. \u201cSuch powers cannot be exercised in a manner which is contrary to fundamental constitutional principles,\u201d they say. The letter adds: \u201cIt would seriously undermine parliamentary sovereignty for you, as prime minister, to prorogue parliament to prevent it from considering whether to legislate to prevent a no-deal Brexit. \u201cYou would be closing the doors of parliament to prevent it from legislating on the most important political issue of the day, when time is of the essence. In such circumstances it would be unlawful for you as prime minister to advise Her Majesty to prorogue parliament for the purpose of preventing parliament from considering the enactment of a law to stop the UK leaving the EU without a deal.\u201d Cross-party groups of MPs who oppose a no-deal Brexit are still hoping to find ways to block such an outcome, which could mean the UK having to apply for a further extension. But Johnson has said that the UK must leave the EU on 31 October \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d. While his opponent in the Tory leadership contest, Jeremy Hunt, has ruled out prorogation to prevent MPs blocking no deal, Johnson has declined to do so. Miller said that she and her legal team were \u201cabsolutely ready to go\u201d to prevent what she said would be an outrageous attempt to bypass parliament, the very institution that Brexiters said they wanted to restore powers to when they campaigned to leave the EU in the June 2016 referendum. After a case brought by Miller that set a constitutional precedent and upheld parliamentary sovereignty, the supreme court ruled by a majority of eight justices to three in January 2017 that MPs and peers must give their consent before the government could trigger article 50 and formally initiate Brexit. Last week the former Tory prime minister Sir John Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. \u201cI served in parliament for over 20 years. I\u2019m very proud to have done so,\u201d said Major. \u201cI have huge admiration for our parliamentary traditions. \u201cI\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion.

But by doing so the society commits suicide,\u201d said L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kiss-Rig\u00f3, the bishop of Szeged, as he drove into Budapest on a recent afternoon. \u201cAnd the more migrants that come, the more Christian values will be watered down.\u201d</p> \n<p>Christian values, or a particular interpretation of them, have become the centrepiece of Hungarian government messaging under its far-right leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and Kiss-Rig\u00f3 operates at the nexus of the prime minister\u2019s interests.</p> \n<p>As well as his role as bishop, he is also the chairman of Szeged\u2019s local football team, which is owned by the church. He was in Budapest to make arrangements for the inaugural concert at a new multipurpose stadium, which will be opened later this summer with an appearance by Placido Domingo \u2013 just one part of the massive investment that the football-mad Orb\u00e1n has made into the sport.</p> \n<p>On the matter of migration, and much else, Kiss-Rig\u00f3 and Orb\u00e1n are singing from the same hymn sheet. The bishop denies, for example, that putting up walls to keep people out of the country doesn\u2019t fit with Christian values. \u201cEveryone who knocks at your door and asks admission is welcome to be examined. But people who jump into your house through the roof should be protected against,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/11/populists-right-unholy-alliance-religion\">The populist right is forging an unholy alliance with religion | Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins and Anton J\u00e4ger </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/hungary-viktor-orban-election-migration?CMP=share_btn_tw\" title=\"\">in his third consecutive term</a>, Orb\u00e1n has increasingly used far-right and anti-migrant rhetoric as he cements control of the country in increasingly authoritarian fashion. He used to describe his system as an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d, but recently he has changed focus, preferring instead to call it a \u201cChristian democracy\u201d. The government\u2019s messaging is still based around stopping immigration and protecting a \u201cbesieged\u201d Europe from outsiders, but it now comes in increasingly Christian packaging, both at home and abroad.</p> \n<p>At a lavish party to mark US independence day in Budapest, Orb\u00e1n told guests that finally, with the accession of Donald Trump, there was an \u201coverlap of values\u201d between the US and Hungary. \u201cNeither of us is willing to accept the hypocrisy of modern politics, which neglects the fact that Christianity is the most persecuted religion globally,\u201d he said. In a sign of just how much things have changed in the relationship over the past few years, Trump\u2019s ambassador David Cornstein called Orb\u00e1n a \u201cperfect partner\u201d and arranged for his old friend, the singer Paul Anka, to serenade the Hungarian prime minister.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad45b444-b035-4d96-826f-2937bd975906\" data-atom-type=\"profile\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Profile\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Born in 1963 in Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r in central Hungary, Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been leader of the Fidesz national conservative party in two long stints since 1993. He has been Hungary\u2019s prime minister between 1998 and 2002, and again since 2010. After two years of military service he studied law in Budapest, and then political science at Pembroke College, Oxford.<br></p>\n    <p>For nationalists across Europe, Orb\u00e1n has become a hero, the embodiment of a nativist leader willing to eschew liberal political correctness and speak aggressively about the need to defend so-called Christian Europe. Steve Bannon has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/opinion/steve-bannon-europe-movement-far-right.html\">called him Trump before Trump</a>, and Nigel Farage and Italy\u2019s Matteo Salvini are admirers.<br></p>\n    <p>For many liberals, and increasingly for some of his supposed allies in the EPP, he signifies all that is rotten, corrupt and downright scary in contemporary politics on the continent.</p>\n    <p>\u201cThe age of liberal democracy is at an end,\u201d Orb\u00e1n told the Hungarian parliament shortly after Fidesz <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/09/hungary-liberals-torrid-four-years-viktor-orban-landslide\">won</a> a third successive electoral victory in 2018. \u201cIt is no longer able to protect people\u2019s dignity, provide freedom, guarantee physical security or maintain Christian culture.\u201d</p>\n    <p>His messaging, repeated in speeches and interviews ad nauseam, is that he is on a mission to protect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hungary\">Hungary</a> and the rest of Europe from the evils of migration from the Middle East and Africa. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/22/hungary-viktor-orban-george-soros\">frequently accused</a> the Hungarian-born financier George Soros of a conspiracy to overrun Europe with Muslim migrants.</p>\n    <p>Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party has a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian parliament, which gives him leeway to make sweeping constitutional changes, and he has spoken of a plan to reshape the country over the next decade. He has installed loyalists in previously independent institutions, put a vast media network under the control of cronies and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/21/hungary-pithy-insult-dogs-orban-as-anti-government-protesters-resort-to-ridicule\">brushed off protests</a> from the disgruntled urban elites.</p>\n    <p>One thing Orb\u00e1n\u2019s admirers and detractors agree on is that he has become symbolic of something bigger than the fate of a smallish central European state with a population of fewer than 10 million. The man himself clearly relishes his increasingly large role in European political discourse.</p>\n    <p>Frustrated with Brussels and other European critics, Orb\u00e1n has built alliances with neighbouring countries, notably throughout the V4, which comprises Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, all of whose leaders have at times expressed varying degrees of unhappiness with the EU, and whose unity in messaging is growing.</p>\n    <p>For Orb\u00e1n, the idea that he is up against an exhausted, decaying vision of Europe is one that he has returned to again and again in his speeches. In October 2018, he implicitly compared today\u2019s EU to the Nazis, Soviets and other imperial powers.</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/shaun-walker\"><b>Shaun Walker</b></a> i<i>n Budapest</i></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump himself lavished praise on Orb\u00e1n during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/13/trump-latest-viktor-orban-hungary-prime-minister-white-house\" title=\"\">a May visit to the White House</a> that ended years of isolation in which top US officials shunned Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government over rule-of-law concerns. \u201cYou have been great with respect to Christian communities.

Orb\u00e1n, who started out in politics in the late 1980s as an anti-communist activist with little time for religion, found God in the 1990s, and even remarried his wife in a religious ceremony.</p> \n<p>Since then, he has frequently invoked Christian values, but of late the intensity has increased.</p> \n<p>Now, barely a month goes by without Orb\u00e1n hosting a delegation of Christian leaders from somewhere in the world. Next year, Budapest will host the <a href=\"https://www.iec2020.hu/en\" title=\"\">International Eucharistic Congress</a>, an international gathering of tens of thousands of Catholics from across the world designed to celebrate the actual presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, which will be accompanied by a vast outdoor mass and various entertainment programmes. The Hungarian State Opera has even announced its forthcoming season will showcase only works that deal with Christian themes.</p> \n<p>But there\u2019s one problem with all this: the policies of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government don\u2019t seem to be particularly Christian. One recent law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/10/hungary-homeless-fear-they-are-viktor-orban-next-target\" title=\"\">saw the criminalisation of homelessness</a>, penalising the street sleepers who are a frequent sight in the underpasses and courtyards of Budapest, rather than dealing with the problem\u2019s causes. Asylum seekers are held in shipping containers in special transit zones near Hungary\u2019s border fence, and the country\u2019s policy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/26/hungary-denying-food-to-asylum-seekers-say-human-rights-groups\" title=\"\">denying food to failed asylum seekers</a> was branded \u201can unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe\u201d by a human rights group. Government-controlled media often<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/13/hungary-journalists-state-tv-network-migrants-viktor-orban-government\" title=\"\"> uses dehumanising rhetoric</a> about migrants and refugees.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2019-07-13T10:57:58.html\" data-alt=\"map showing Hungary in Europe\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/jul/2019-07-13T10:57:58.html\">map showing Hungary in Europe</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Kiss-Rig\u00f3, who believes that most migrants at the Hungarian border are wealthier than the police repelling them, and that \u201conly a tiny minority\u201d are actually refugees, sidestepped questions on whether he agreed with the pope\u2019s calls for tolerance.</p> \n<p>Others have been less reticent. A journalist and founding member of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, Zsolt Bayer, said in 2016 that the pope was \u201ceither a <a href=\"http://hungarianspectrum.org/2016/08/13/pope-francis-and-his-hungarian-critics/\" title=\"\">senile old fool or a scoundrel</a>\u201d for his pro-refugee sentiments.</p> \n<p>Not all of Hungary\u2019s religious leaders feel the same. G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi, a Methodist priest with a flowing, white beard who runs a homeless shelter in the scruffy eighth district of Budapest, was formerly on good terms with Orb\u00e1n and even officiated at his (second, religious) wedding ceremony, but now decries the prime minster\u2019s policies as being the opposite of Christian teachings. Last summer, he tried to distribute food to people being held in the transit zones, but was denied access. Some critics suggest that \u201cChristian values\u201d is code for something else altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s just no doubt that this is organised as a way of saying that \u2018Christianity\u2019 means \u2018white conservative Europe\u2019. It\u2019s a trope. Say the world \u2018Christian\u2019 and it says everything else that you want to say,\u201d said Michael Ignatieff, rector of the Central European University, which is moving part of its <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/ceu-hungary-ignatieff-1.4929821\" title=\"\">operations from Budapest to Vienna</a> after the government denied it accreditation.</p> \n<p>Kiss-Rig\u00f3 would perhaps agree. He conceded that Hungarians are much less religious than Poles, for example, but defined \u201cChristian values\u201d in vague cultural terms: as much about shutting out the Muslim \u201cother\u201d as about any sense of personal religious belief. His favourite author is the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/06/strange-death-europe-immigration-xenophobia\" title=\"\">British anti-Islam commentator Douglas Murray</a>, and he said Europe was in danger of being turned into a \u201ceasily manipulable faceless mass\u201d by unspecified dark forces.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying all of this because I hope that next Sunday more people will come to church. In Europe, even an atheist is a Christian,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Hungary\u2019s foreign policy has also been taking on an increasingly Christian hue.

      "bodyText": "\u201cEurope can ignore or deny or struggle against its own identity and its Christian roots. But by doing so the society commits suicide,\u201d said L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Kiss-Rig\u00f3, the bishop of Szeged, as he drove into Budapest on a recent afternoon. \u201cAnd the more migrants that come, the more Christian values will be watered down.\u201d Christian values, or a particular interpretation of them, have become the centrepiece of Hungarian government messaging under its far-right leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, and Kiss-Rig\u00f3 operates at the nexus of the prime minister\u2019s interests. As well as his role as bishop, he is also the chairman of Szeged\u2019s local football team, which is owned by the church. He was in Budapest to make arrangements for the inaugural concert at a new multipurpose stadium, which will be opened later this summer with an appearance by Placido Domingo \u2013 just one part of the massive investment that the football-mad Orb\u00e1n has made into the sport. On the matter of migration, and much else, Kiss-Rig\u00f3 and Orb\u00e1n are singing from the same hymn sheet. The bishop denies, for example, that putting up walls to keep people out of the country doesn\u2019t fit with Christian values. \u201cEveryone who knocks at your door and asks admission is welcome to be examined. But people who jump into your house through the roof should be protected against,\u201d he said. Now in his third consecutive term, Orb\u00e1n has increasingly used far-right and anti-migrant rhetoric as he cements control of the country in increasingly authoritarian fashion. He used to describe his system as an \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d, but recently he has changed focus, preferring instead to call it a \u201cChristian democracy\u201d. The government\u2019s messaging is still based around stopping immigration and protecting a \u201cbesieged\u201d Europe from outsiders, but it now comes in increasingly Christian packaging, both at home and abroad. At a lavish party to mark US independence day in Budapest, Orb\u00e1n told guests that finally, with the accession of Donald Trump, there was an \u201coverlap of values\u201d between the US and Hungary. \u201cNeither of us is willing to accept the hypocrisy of modern politics, which neglects the fact that Christianity is the most persecuted religion globally,\u201d he said. In a sign of just how much things have changed in the relationship over the past few years, Trump\u2019s ambassador David Cornstein called Orb\u00e1n a \u201cperfect partner\u201d and arranged for his old friend, the singer Paul Anka, to serenade the Hungarian prime minister. Trump himself lavished praise on Orb\u00e1n during a May visit to the White House that ended years of isolation in which top US officials shunned Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government over rule-of-law concerns. \u201cYou have been great with respect to Christian communities. You have really put a block up and we appreciate that very much,\u201d said Trump, apparently referring to the fence Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government has built along Hungary\u2019s southern border to keep out migrants. The Hungarian Catholic church, the largest church in the country, has been supportive of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s hardline policies on migration, despite frequent calls from the pope for Europe to be more tolerant and understanding of the suffering of those who have fled war and poverty. Only 15% of Hungarians say they attend church on a weekly basis, but 80% identify as Christian. Orb\u00e1n, who started out in politics in the late 1980s as an anti-communist activist with little time for religion, found God in the 1990s, and even remarried his wife in a religious ceremony. Since then, he has frequently invoked Christian values, but of late the intensity has increased. Now, barely a month goes by without Orb\u00e1n hosting a delegation of Christian leaders from somewhere in the world. Next year, Budapest will host the International Eucharistic Congress, an international gathering of tens of thousands of Catholics from across the world designed to celebrate the actual presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, which will be accompanied by a vast outdoor mass and various entertainment programmes. The Hungarian State Opera has even announced its forthcoming season will showcase only works that deal with Christian themes. But there\u2019s one problem with all this: the policies of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government don\u2019t seem to be particularly Christian. One recent law saw the criminalisation of homelessness, penalising the street sleepers who are a frequent sight in the underpasses and courtyards of Budapest, rather than dealing with the problem\u2019s causes. Asylum seekers are held in shipping containers in special transit zones near Hungary\u2019s border fence, and the country\u2019s policy of denying food to failed asylum seekers was branded \u201can unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe\u201d by a human rights group. Government-controlled media often uses dehumanising rhetoric about migrants and refugees. Kiss-Rig\u00f3, who believes that most migrants at the Hungarian border are wealthier than the police repelling them, and that \u201conly a tiny minority\u201d are actually refugees, sidestepped questions on whether he agreed with the pope\u2019s calls for tolerance. Others have been less reticent. A journalist and founding member of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party, Zsolt Bayer, said in 2016 that the pope was \u201ceither a senile old fool or a scoundrel\u201d for his pro-refugee sentiments. Not all of Hungary\u2019s religious leaders feel the same. G\u00e1bor Iv\u00e1nyi, a Methodist priest with a flowing, white beard who runs a homeless shelter in the scruffy eighth district of Budapest, was formerly on good terms with Orb\u00e1n and even officiated at his (second, religious) wedding ceremony, but now decries the prime minster\u2019s policies as being the opposite of Christian teachings. Last summer, he tried to distribute food to people being held in the transit zones, but was denied access. Some critics suggest that \u201cChristian values\u201d is code for something else altogether. \u201cThere\u2019s just no doubt that this is organised as a way of saying that \u2018Christianity\u2019 means \u2018white conservative Europe\u2019. It\u2019s a trope. Say the world \u2018Christian\u2019 and it says everything else that you want to say,\u201d said Michael Ignatieff, rector of the Central European University, which is moving part of its operations from Budapest to Vienna after the government denied it accreditation. Kiss-Rig\u00f3 would perhaps agree. He conceded that Hungarians are much less religious than Poles, for example, but defined \u201cChristian values\u201d in vague cultural terms: as much about shutting out the Muslim \u201cother\u201d as about any sense of personal religious belief. His favourite author is the British anti-Islam commentator Douglas Murray, and he said Europe was in danger of being turned into a \u201ceasily manipulable faceless mass\u201d by unspecified dark forces. \u201cI\u2019m not saying all of this because I hope that next Sunday more people will come to church. In Europe, even an atheist is a Christian,\u201d he said. Hungary\u2019s foreign policy has also been taking on an increasingly Christian hue. A special \u201cHungary Helps\u201d programme has been set up to provide aid to persecuted Christians in Africa and the Middle East. \u201cHelp should be provided where the trouble lies instead of bringing the trouble to Europe,\u201d said a spokesman for the programme. He said it had disbursed $30m in aid in the past two years, almost exclusively to help Christian communities or projects backed by Christian groups. As Budapest has come in for increasing criticism from Brussels over rule-of-law concerns and democratic backsliding, Orb\u00e1n has wooed other far-right leaders who use Christian rhetoric. He was the only EU leader to attend the inauguration of Brazil\u2019s president Jair Bolsonaro in January, while he enjoys a warm relationship with the Law and Justice government in Poland. Katalin Nov\u00e1k, Hungary\u2019s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, has also had a busy travel schedule, meeting rightwing and Christian groups in many countries to showcase the government\u2019s policies on improving birth rates and promoting traditional values. In March, she gave the keynote address at a conference organised by the Hungarian embassy in Washington entitled \u201cMaking Families Great Again\u201d, attended by a number of rightwing American Christian groups. \u201cWe think that the problems of Europe can be traced back to the denial of Christian roots. We see the misinterpretation of tolerance many times. Being tolerant should not mean that one gives up his or her identity,\u201d said Nov\u00e1k, in written responses to questions. These talking points have hit home with some rightwing Republicans, improving the standing of Orb\u00e1n in Washington, and meaning some officials ended up more suspicious of NGOs and opposition activists than of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government. \u201cWrapping itself in the words of being a Christian nation, with traditional values, created a subtext that critics are not legitimately concerned about the deterioration of the rule of law, but instead motivated by a progressive and pro-LGBT agenda,\u201d said Scott Cullinane, who until last year was professional staff member on a congressional subcommittee dealing with Hungary. Orb\u00e1n\u2019s position in Europe looks to be weakened after the recent European elections and a series of scandals among potential far-right allies, which means the approval of Trump and rightwing republicans is a useful blessing. \u201cWe are very happy that there are a few politicians like Orb\u00e1n and Trump who really represent those values which we Christians believe to be important,\u201d said Kiss-Rig\u00f3, when asked if it was plausible to hold up the US president as a paragon of Christian virtue. For him, as for Orb\u00e1n, the backlash against liberalism is more important than any specific Christian virtues. \u201cI don\u2019t think he will be canonised in the Catholic church but this is not the point.

      "bodyText": "Jacob Zuma, South Africa\u2019s former president, will make an unprecedented appearance before a judicial inquiry for a five-day grilling this week over corruption allegations relating to his years in power. Zuma has been accused of presiding over an immense system of corruption and patronage that drained billions from the exchequer and damaged the reputation of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) beyond repair. But there are fears that the veteran politician will use the hearings as a platform to attack his successor, Cyril Ramaphosa, who ousted Zuma last year, aggravating the bitter struggle between factions of the divided party. Although Ramaphosa led the ANC to a convincing electoral victory in May, the 66-year-old tycoon and former labour activist has so far been unable to assert his authority over the party, and observers say he is looking increasingly weak. \u201cRamaphosa is entering a very dark hour and his defenders are few and far between,\u201d wrote commentator Adriaan Basson shortly after Ramaphosa made the traditional state of the nation address. A quarter of a century after the end of the apartheid system, South Africa remains one of the most unequal societies in the world, with soaring unemployment, a flagging economy and high levels of violent crime. Last week ministers announced that troops would be deployed in poor neighbourhoods close to the western city of Cape Town following a spate of gang murders. Earlier this year the country endured rolling electricity cuts. The inquiry, led by Raymond Zondo, a senior judge, is mandated to probe allegations of \u201cstate capture\u201d in South Africa during Zuma\u2019s nine-year rule. It was set up following an ombudsman\u2019s report that uncovered apparent evidence of improper contact between three wealthy businessmen brothers \u2013 the Guptas \u2013 and senior officials in Zuma\u2019s administration.

But the hearing could give Zuma, 77, a platform from which to rally supporters, or even attack his successor. Ramaphosa, who served as Zuma\u2019s deputy president, told the Guardian last year that he was prepared to appear before the inquiry in order to account for his actions during what he described as a \u201cvery dark period of our recent history\u201d. \u201cThe question has been raised: \u2018You were there, you were deputy president, and many of these things were happening under your nose.

Last week Busisiwe Mkhwebane, an independent state anti-corruption ombudsman, claimed that the public enterprises minister, Pravin Gordhan, a close ally of Ramaphosa, abused his powers during a stint as finance minister. Gordhan has denied the charge, which is seen as an indirect attack on the president. \u201cRamaphosa is between a rock and a hard place. If he fails to defend Gordhan, then his political credibility will be badly damaged. But the more he defends Gordhan the less he can make a workable compromise within the ANC,\u201d said Ralph Mathekga, an author and analyst. Mkhwebane has also launched an investigation into Ramaphosa himself after allegations that his presidential campaign fund may have received a donation from a company that is implicated in the wider state capture inquiry. The ANC is split between reformists who back Ramaphosa\u2019s anti-graft drive and favour more business-friendly policies, and others, often loyal to Zuma, who call for more radical measures to redistribute wealth. Zuma appointed loyalists to hundreds of top positions in the police, tax revenue services, intelligence agencies and other top public posts. Allies say Ramaphosa is a pragmatist who does not want to split the ANC but there is rising frustration with the slow pace of reform. \u201cIt\u2019s all about compromises with Ramaphosa but the need for changes is so urgent in South Africa that you need firm, fast action,\u201d Mathekga said. The continuing uncertainty and absence of obvious headline measures to boost growth has hit investment. \u201cRamaphosa needs to own the levers of power and the commanding heights of the economy. He is still playing Mr Nice Guy and is being frustrated in bringing about the reform that is necessary ... that might require a more disruptive approach,\u201d said Dominic Armstrong, chief executive of the Horatius Fund, an investment group. Zuma faces a separate corruption investigation involving 16 charges of fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa\u2019s armed forces in 1994. He denies the charges. The state capture inquiry hearings have been broadcast live, and attracted large numbers of viewers. It is unclear how cooperative Zuma will be during the hearings but his lawyer, Dan Mantsha, said on TV last week that his client was \u201crelishing the moment\u201d.",

The demise of the creature whose peevish underbite launched a thousand merchandising and sponsorship deals, from cereal and soft toys to video games (not to mention a surprising number of tattoos), has doubtless left a gap in her owners the Bundesens\u2019 hearts, but it has also opened up an opportunity in the petfluencer (sorry, it\u2019s a thing) market.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Oscar does not like cuddles, fun, me, or other dogs</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is excellent news for me, because times are tough for freelance writers and I have decided my bad-tempered elderly whippet, Oscar, needs to start pulling his weight.

Animal influencers have real financial clout, attracting brand partnerships, sponsors and merchandising opportunities. It\u2019s easy to see why. Animals don\u2019t get gropey at parties or turn out to be horrifyingly racist; they simply make us feel good. US superstar pets can earn up to $16,000 for a social media post.

If an animal posts a product online to sell, we\u2019re getting much higher returns.\u201d Urban Paws represents Instagram big hitters <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brunotheminidachshund/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Bruno the Mini Dachshund</a> (a perky, often-accessorised sausage, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brunotheminidachshund/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@brunotheminidachshund</a>), and Maine Coon Life (two magnificently angry-looking cats, like ultra-fluffy Kray twins; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/themainecoonlife/\" title=\"\">@themainecoonlife</a>). They organise brand partnerships with HarperCollins and Warner Music; a number of Stewart\u2019s clients are now full-time petfluencer wranglers.</p> <p>The newest growth market is \u201cmicro-influencers\u201d, animals with between 5k and 20k followers, as Sasha Wilkins (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/libertylndngirl/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/libertylndngirl/?hl=en\" title=\"\">liberty</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/libertylndngirl/?hl=en\" title=\"\">lndn</a><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/libertylndngirl/?hl=en\" title=\"\">girl</a>), more of a macro-influencer herself, with 46.5k followers, explains. \u201cBig brands are moving more towards working with micro-influencers than really big influencers, because the micro-influencers have super- engaged audiences.\u201d</p> <p>This, I hope, is where Oscar can carve out a niche and where I, an avid consumer of animal content, can help. Like many online, I am exhausted by Twitter \u2013 the buzzing of a million hornets \u2013 and revolted by the wholesome humblebragging of Facebook. Human Instagram is a demented envy factory, but animal Instagram (equally artificial, admittedly) is a sweetly uncritical place of <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/noseboops/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#noseboops</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/snoots/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#snoots</a> where furred and feathered friends like each other\u2019s naps and snacks.

Emma Beddington with Oscar, hot new Instagram star @je_suis_ouipette</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Telfer/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are, however, problems. Firstly, Oscar answers to no one (\u201cMost of my pet influencers are exceptionally well-trained,\u201d warns Stewart). My 10-year-old can sit, theoretically, but chooses not to and acknowledges no other commands. He is no <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gigi-hadid\" title=\"\">Gigi Hadid</a> either since an Alsatian attacked him last year: he\u2019s crazy-paved with scars and bald patches. You don\u2019t have to be beautiful to succeed on Instagram; endearingly ugly works too. Tuna (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tunathedog_/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@tunameltsmyheart</a>), a chihuahua-dachshund cross with an overbite and expression of existential dread, has 2 million followers. However I fear Oscar falls between the two camps and as his besotted personal assistant, I am well placed to say his sparkling personality will not make the difference.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As his besotted personal assistant, I am well placed to say Oscar's sparkling personality will not make the difference</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This is the biggest problem. Oscar\u2019s permanent expression is one of stony disappointment, and it\u2019s not just an expression: it\u2019s his personality. He doesn\u2019t like cuddles, fun, me, or other dogs. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play, Logan, he never wants to play,\u201d a man says to his wolfhound puppy (rather pointedly, I think) as Oscar dodges his giant paws in disgust when they meet in the park of a morning. He recently refused to be stroked by a bereaved whippet owner, staring balefully into the distance and tilting his head to evade pats. \u201cMine was much friendlier,\u201d the man said, sorrowfully. But if Grumpy Cat taught us anything, it is that \u201clooked disgruntled\u201d on the internet sells and looking disgruntled is Oscar\u2019s forte. Can I monetise his sepulchral #snoot?

His owner, Paz Oh, is a jewellery designer. \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore this minimal, very monochrome look. I like things really simple, so it came naturally.\u201d Despite a series of brand collaborations with the likes of Jaguar and Anouska Hempel, she\u2019s refreshingly relaxed about the whole business: \u201cMore planning, less fun. The posts that are more spontaneous get more likes.\u201d Her main tip is treats. \u201cCheese works well, or sprats.\u201d She also recommends using a blanket (skinny dogs hate hard surfaces) and exploiting the Stories feature. \u201cPeople love seeing the reality of the dog moving, those moments sometimes work better in videos.\u201d</p> <p>I post a Story of Oscar trudging through the rain, quoting Verlaine. My friend Annie replies: \u201cI fear he\u2019d become tiresome down the pub, musing on the pointlessness of alcohol when all is dust, etc.\u201d Oscar also gets his first sex spam message. If anyone is having a stranger week than me, it\u2019s the person (bot?) sending a dog erotic pictures.</p> <p><em><strong>Day Four</strong></em></p> <p>Instagram is all about engagement: following, liking and commenting on the right accounts to lure them back to yours, so Wilkins, whose miniature dachshund <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lovelylettice/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@lovelylettice</a> also has an account, gives me a whistlestop tutorial. \u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s a bit like other people\u2019s children: they\u2019re not that interesting unless they\u2019re particularly cute. But we love our dogs so much we\u2019re happy when other people appreciate them. You need to comment on as many posts as possible. The most successful Instagrammers I know literally spend four hours a day liking and commenting on other people\u2019s posts.\u201d</p> <p>Paula Stewart knows engagement works; she has been experimenting with her tortoise, Jeff. \u201cI spend an hour every night interacting with other people.\u201d With his tireless liking and commenting, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeff_the_tort/\" title=\"\">@jeff_the_tort</a> has far outstripped her conventionally cuter, but less engaged dogs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2389dcf6ab81b956e2ca9b9b0b0e8db864a2141\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2389dcf6ab81b956e2ca9b9b0b0e8db864a2141/0_0_472_473/472.jpg\" alt=\"Bark star: bull terrier Neville @nevillejacobs Neville is the dog of Marc Jacobs he is a Bull Terrier\" width=\"472\" height=\"473\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bark star: bull terrier Neville @nevillejacobs Neville is the dog of Marc Jacobs he is a Bull Terrier</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: @nevillejacobs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I try to engage in the pretentious spirit of Insta-Oscar, commenting on a whippet post captioned \u201cmorning snuggles\u201d with \u201cthis is like a Lucian Freud\u201d, and complimenting so many hounds with an expansive \u201c<em>mon ami</em>\u201d that Oscar sounds like Poirot. Soon, however, engagement fatigue sets in and the quality of our comments plummets. \u201cBeautiful dog!\u201d \u201cAdorable!\u201d I write, mechanically, adding multiple insincere heart-eye emojis. At several points during this process I find myself imagining explaining my job to my stepfather, who gets his news from <em>Le Monde Diplomatique</em> and his kicks from translating Turgenev.</p> <p><em><strong>Day Five</strong></em></p> <p>Matching each picture with a philosophical aphorism was madness, it transpires: I spend hours combing the internet for suitably pretentious quotes. I bet there\u2019s an existentialist take on \u201crod for your own back\u201d but if I have to look at <a href=\"https://www.brainyquote.com/\" title=\"\">brainyquote.com</a> again, I\u2019m going to set fire to my phone.</p> <p>I\u2019m also mired in finding the right hashtags, following Wilkins\u2019s advice to look for ones where Oscar\u2019s posts will reach like-minded hounds, but not get lost in the crowd. \u201cGo for <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/whippet/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#whippet</a> and there\u2019ll be 5m posts, but go for <a href=\"http://picdeer.com/tag/intellectualwhippet\" title=\"\">#intellectualwhippet</a> and it\u2019ll be relatively niche.\u201d</p> <p>I find a selection of mid-level tags to add to my posts to no discernible effect. In the evening I realise the picture I am about to post \u2013 our best yet, he doesn\u2019t even look furious \u2013 includes a nice shot of Oscar\u2019s nose: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/boop/?hl=en\" title=\"\">#boop</a> I type, death in my soul. It gets a rubbish 92 likes.</p> <p><em><strong>Day Six</strong></em></p> <p>It\u2019s the weekend, so my husband provides artistic input and an extra pair of hands: we shoot Oscar reluctantly sitting on a wall and looking disappointed at a river. As I edit the shots, I realise we didn\u2019t do his collar up, spoiling the look, and remonstrate with my husband.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s relaxed! He\u2019s casual!\u201d he protests. \u201cThat\u2019s not how Instagram works,\u201d I screech, like the harpy I have become. Later I brush past him and he recoils in horror: \u201cYou smell disgusting.\u201d I have been trying to bribe Oscar into sitting on a cushion so I can tag its creator on Instagram in the hope she\u2019ll repost to her followers. This is my life now, sprat-scented and devoid of integrity.</p> <p>Our follower count stalls at 199; eventually I beg a friend to get us over the 200 mark. Another friend messages me: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/waltergeoffreythefrenchie/\" title=\"\">@waltergeoffreythefrenchie</a>, the screaming Frenchie, charges $50 for a personalised Insta message!\u201d It\u2019s something to aspire to, I suppose.</p> <p><em><strong>Day Seven</strong></em></p> <p>We gain a few followers through my constant anodyne commenting, but lose several more, presumably discouraged by the crushing nihilism of Oscar\u2019s feed. By mid-afternoon, hallucinating long-faced dogs, I forget my principles and tweet a desperate plea for follows on Twitter. I enjoy the subsequent dopamine rush as we climb to 269 followers. This is our final tally: by any metric, a complete failure. We also have one failed brand collaboration: a dog bandana company messages to ask if we\u2019re interested in modelling; I reply enthusiastically, but never hear from them again (was it the Nietzsche?)</p> <p>Stewart sympathises. \u201cI\u2019ve found it incredibly difficult, much harder than I thought it would be,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are more dog owners than any other animal in the UK and everyone\u2019s trying to make their dog famous.\u201d I\u2019ve been stunned by the sheer amount of work influencers put into getting and staying successful; I notice <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeff_the_tort/\" title=\"\">@jeff_the_tort</a> has left encouraging comments on most of our posts, including one on Camus\u2019s Myth of Sysyphus: \u201cLet\u2019s roll that boulder through Tuesday, too!\u201d</p> <p>I think it\u2019s time to retire from content creation. We\u2019re exhausted and confused and one of us is licking his testicles. Petfluencing is a pup\u2019s game. I do, however, have a fairly vivacious tortoise; perhaps Jeff could give us some tips?</p> <p><em><strong>Follow Oscar on Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/je_suis_ouipette/\" title=\"\">@je_suis_ouipette</a></strong></em></p>",

      "bodyText": "Grumpy Cat, the internet\u2019s favourite seemingly furious feline, died in May, to a global outpouring of sadness, an emotion she would presumably have appreciated. The demise of the creature whose peevish underbite launched a thousand merchandising and sponsorship deals, from cereal and soft toys to video games (not to mention a surprising number of tattoos), has doubtless left a gap in her owners the Bundesens\u2019 hearts, but it has also opened up an opportunity in the petfluencer (sorry, it\u2019s a thing) market. This is excellent news for me, because times are tough for freelance writers and I have decided my bad-tempered elderly whippet, Oscar, needs to start pulling his weight. I adore him, but after 10 years of freeloading, 98% of which has been spent asleep and eschewing affection, the final straw came at Easter when he ruined a carpet to the tune of \u00a3785 after stealing and eating a rotten kebab. The digital pet landscape may be far more saturated than it was in Grumpy Cat\u2019s heyday, but opportunities still abound for enterprising animals (or more accurately, their anthropomorphising owners). Why? Because we live in an age that idolises them: an age of handbag dogs, emotional support peacocks and luxury cat hotels. Animal influencers have real financial clout, attracting brand partnerships, sponsors and merchandising opportunities. It\u2019s easy to see why. Animals don\u2019t get gropey at parties or turn out to be horrifyingly racist; they simply make us feel good. US superstar pets can earn up to $16,000 for a social media post. In her book Influencer, digital guru Brittany Hennessy wrote she \u201conce paid a dog $32,000 for two Facebook posts, one Instagram post, and one tweet.\u201d There are whole years I have earned less than that. Pet influencers are big business here too, according to Paula Stewart of the Urban Paws agency. \u201cPet lovers are more engaged than celebrity audiences. If an animal posts a product online to sell, we\u2019re getting much higher returns.\u201d Urban Paws represents Instagram big hitters Bruno the Mini Dachshund (a perky, often-accessorised sausage, @brunotheminidachshund), and Maine Coon Life (two magnificently angry-looking cats, like ultra-fluffy Kray twins; @themainecoonlife). They organise brand partnerships with HarperCollins and Warner Music; a number of Stewart\u2019s clients are now full-time petfluencer wranglers. The newest growth market is \u201cmicro-influencers\u201d, animals with between 5k and 20k followers, as Sasha Wilkins (@libertylndngirl), more of a macro-influencer herself, with 46.5k followers, explains. \u201cBig brands are moving more towards working with micro-influencers than really big influencers, because the micro-influencers have super- engaged audiences.\u201d This, I hope, is where Oscar can carve out a niche and where I, an avid consumer of animal content, can help. Like many online, I am exhausted by Twitter \u2013 the buzzing of a million hornets \u2013 and revolted by the wholesome humblebragging of Facebook. Human Instagram is a demented envy factory, but animal Instagram (equally artificial, admittedly) is a sweetly uncritical place of #noseboops and #snoots where furred and feathered friends like each other\u2019s naps and snacks. I follow numerous animal accounts, from a motley crew of elderly dogs (@wolfgang2242) to a woman who inexplicably lives in a house full of foxes (@juniperfoxx) and @nevillejacobs, Marc Jacobs\u2019s chic bull terrier. I have also tried and rejected several more, including Pumpkin the Raccoon, Jill, a sweet but boring squirrel, and several capybaras. Surely knowing the fine line between repetitive and inconsistent, funny and annoying, will help? There are, however, problems. Firstly, Oscar answers to no one (\u201cMost of my pet influencers are exceptionally well-trained,\u201d warns Stewart). My 10-year-old can sit, theoretically, but chooses not to and acknowledges no other commands. He is no Gigi Hadid either since an Alsatian attacked him last year: he\u2019s crazy-paved with scars and bald patches. You don\u2019t have to be beautiful to succeed on Instagram; endearingly ugly works too. Tuna (@tunameltsmyheart), a chihuahua-dachshund cross with an overbite and expression of existential dread, has 2 million followers. However I fear Oscar falls between the two camps and as his besotted personal assistant, I am well placed to say his sparkling personality will not make the difference. This is the biggest problem. Oscar\u2019s permanent expression is one of stony disappointment, and it\u2019s not just an expression: it\u2019s his personality. He doesn\u2019t like cuddles, fun, me, or other dogs. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want to play, Logan, he never wants to play,\u201d a man says to his wolfhound puppy (rather pointedly, I think) as Oscar dodges his giant paws in disgust when they meet in the park of a morning. He recently refused to be stroked by a bereaved whippet owner, staring balefully into the distance and tilting his head to evade pats. \u201cMine was much friendlier,\u201d the man said, sorrowfully. But if Grumpy Cat taught us anything, it is that \u201clooked disgruntled\u201d on the internet sells and looking disgruntled is Oscar\u2019s forte. Can I monetise his sepulchral #snoot? Time to find out. Day One I start trying to crack the micro-influencer market by talking to one. Elle (@grrlgenius_), a French bulldog, and minder Coco Quill, a digital marketer, have 17.1k followers and have worked with brands including Barbour and Diesel. Quill started the account in 2012 to connect with the Frenchie community, but Elle (\u201ca clown dog wrapped in a philosopher\u2019s coat\u201d) found a keen following. Quill is very clear it\u2019s work as well as fun, editing pictures, engaging with followers and managing the commercial side. \u201cIt can be flattering when a brand you like wants to work with you\u2026 it can also be gruelling.\u201d Her advice for a would-be petfluencer? \u201cHave a strong tone of voice and look at your grid [your most recent photos] as a magazine.\u201d I know what Oscar\u2019s voice will be: a pretentious French philosophy bore, with a craven desire for internet validation. There will be no cuteness and no \u201cboops\u201d or \u201czoomies\u201d (hound Instagram vernacular for short bursts of running), just bleak philosophical quotes and pictures of Oscar doing what he does best: nothing, while looking like a thwarted Old Testament prophet. I create a @je_suis_ouipette Instagram account \u2013 tagline: \u201cHell is other people. And dogs. And squirrels (especially squirrels)\u201d \u2013 and recycle an old photo of him asleep. I mention him on my own account once, but vow that his future growth must be organic. Later I add an Instagram Story in which he quotes Jean-Paul Sartre, staring at the camera in grim displeasure. I follow some of the biggest pet names online to see how they do it. Global celebrity Doug the Pug (@itsdougthepug; 3.8m followers) keeps it simple with short captions and cute costumes; @jiffpom, a perfectly teased Pomeranian, who at 9 million followers clearly doesn\u2019t even have to try any more, just signs each post with a heart emoji. There is, of course, nothing new about our weird relationship with animals. In 1826 Zarafa, France\u2019s first giraffe, became a national celebrity, sparking a craze for giraffe-inspired fabric, porcelain and even towering hairdos; a clear forerunner to Doug the Pug\u2019s range for Claire\u2019s Accessories. Harry Whittier Frees\u2019s eery early 1900s photographs of costumed cats are uncannily reminiscent of the #cute content we love today, while back in the 1970s photographer William Wegman was snapping his lugubrious Weimaraners in wigs, raincoats and blouses in poses that would set Instagram on fire today. Day Two We\u2019re at 101 followers and at 6.15am I\u2019m Googling ontological errors of Cartesian rationalism. I need to post at 8am, the best time according to Paula Stewart. \u201cBus to work, 8am till 9am, then sitting down and having your dinner, 6pm to 7pm.\u201d A lot of Instagram success turns on mastering the platform\u2019s mysterious algorithms and the numerous tricks of the trade include this one.

Usually when Oscar sees my phone, he starts to lick his genitals; at best, he glares angrily over my shoulder. If our grid were a magazine, it would be called something like Forbiddingly Beige. I contact Matt Townsend, who photographs whippets as @trianglefaces, for some tips. \u201cYou see a range of quality. A lot of people are happy just snapping away, a lot of close-ups, a lot of nose boops\u2026 What I do with my little one (@poppet.the.whippet) is hang around her with my camera all the time so she\u2019s happy it\u2019s in her face.\u201d Townsend edits his own shots, but rates the Lightroom app; I download and stare cluelessly at it. It\u2019s like the flight deck of a Boeing 787. Townsend recommends @allaboutlloyd_, a grey whippet with a ravishingly minimalist feed. His owner, Paz Oh, is a jewellery designer. \u201cI\u2019m trying to explore this minimal, very monochrome look. I like things really simple, so it came naturally.\u201d Despite a series of brand collaborations with the likes of Jaguar and Anouska Hempel, she\u2019s refreshingly relaxed about the whole business: \u201cMore planning, less fun. The posts that are more spontaneous get more likes.\u201d Her main tip is treats. \u201cCheese works well, or sprats.\u201d She also recommends using a blanket (skinny dogs hate hard surfaces) and exploiting the Stories feature. \u201cPeople love seeing the reality of the dog moving, those moments sometimes work better in videos.\u201d I post a Story of Oscar trudging through the rain, quoting Verlaine. My friend Annie replies: \u201cI fear he\u2019d become tiresome down the pub, musing on the pointlessness of alcohol when all is dust, etc.\u201d Oscar also gets his first sex spam message. If anyone is having a stranger week than me, it\u2019s the person (bot?) sending a dog erotic pictures. Day Four Instagram is all about engagement: following, liking and commenting on the right accounts to lure them back to yours, so Wilkins, whose miniature dachshund @lovelylettice also has an account, gives me a whistlestop tutorial. \u201cThe truth is that it\u2019s a bit like other people\u2019s children: they\u2019re not that interesting unless they\u2019re particularly cute. But we love our dogs so much we\u2019re happy when other people appreciate them. You need to comment on as many posts as possible. The most successful Instagrammers I know literally spend four hours a day liking and commenting on other people\u2019s posts.\u201d Paula Stewart knows engagement works; she has been experimenting with her tortoise, Jeff. \u201cI spend an hour every night interacting with other people.\u201d With his tireless liking and commenting, @jeff_the_tort has far outstripped her conventionally cuter, but less engaged dogs. I try to engage in the pretentious spirit of Insta-Oscar, commenting on a whippet post captioned \u201cmorning snuggles\u201d with \u201cthis is like a Lucian Freud\u201d, and complimenting so many hounds with an expansive \u201cmon ami\u201d that Oscar sounds like Poirot. Soon, however, engagement fatigue sets in and the quality of our comments plummets. \u201cBeautiful dog!\u201d \u201cAdorable!\u201d I write, mechanically, adding multiple insincere heart-eye emojis. At several points during this process I find myself imagining explaining my job to my stepfather, who gets his news from Le Monde Diplomatique and his kicks from translating Turgenev. Day Five Matching each picture with a philosophical aphorism was madness, it transpires: I spend hours combing the internet for suitably pretentious quotes. I bet there\u2019s an existentialist take on \u201crod for your own back\u201d but if I have to look at brainyquote.com again, I\u2019m going to set fire to my phone. I\u2019m also mired in finding the right hashtags, following Wilkins\u2019s advice to look for ones where Oscar\u2019s posts will reach like-minded hounds, but not get lost in the crowd. \u201cGo for #whippet and there\u2019ll be 5m posts, but go for #intellectualwhippet and it\u2019ll be relatively niche.\u201d I find a selection of mid-level tags to add to my posts to no discernible effect. In the evening I realise the picture I am about to post \u2013 our best yet, he doesn\u2019t even look furious \u2013 includes a nice shot of Oscar\u2019s nose: #boop I type, death in my soul. It gets a rubbish 92 likes. Day Six It\u2019s the weekend, so my husband provides artistic input and an extra pair of hands: we shoot Oscar reluctantly sitting on a wall and looking disappointed at a river. As I edit the shots, I realise we didn\u2019t do his collar up, spoiling the look, and remonstrate with my husband. \u201cIt\u2019s relaxed! He\u2019s casual!\u201d he protests. \u201cThat\u2019s not how Instagram works,\u201d I screech, like the harpy I have become. Later I brush past him and he recoils in horror: \u201cYou smell disgusting.\u201d I have been trying to bribe Oscar into sitting on a cushion so I can tag its creator on Instagram in the hope she\u2019ll repost to her followers. This is my life now, sprat-scented and devoid of integrity. Our follower count stalls at 199; eventually I beg a friend to get us over the 200 mark. Another friend messages me: \u201c@waltergeoffreythefrenchie, the screaming Frenchie, charges $50 for a personalised Insta message!\u201d It\u2019s something to aspire to, I suppose. Day Seven We gain a few followers through my constant anodyne commenting, but lose several more, presumably discouraged by the crushing nihilism of Oscar\u2019s feed. By mid-afternoon, hallucinating long-faced dogs, I forget my principles and tweet a desperate plea for follows on Twitter. I enjoy the subsequent dopamine rush as we climb to 269 followers. This is our final tally: by any metric, a complete failure. We also have one failed brand collaboration: a dog bandana company messages to ask if we\u2019re interested in modelling; I reply enthusiastically, but never hear from them again (was it the Nietzsche?) Stewart sympathises. \u201cI\u2019ve found it incredibly difficult, much harder than I thought it would be,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are more dog owners than any other animal in the UK and everyone\u2019s trying to make their dog famous.\u201d I\u2019ve been stunned by the sheer amount of work influencers put into getting and staying successful; I notice @jeff_the_tort has left encouraging comments on most of our posts, including one on Camus\u2019s Myth of Sysyphus: \u201cLet\u2019s roll that boulder through Tuesday, too!\u201d I think it\u2019s time to retire from content creation. We\u2019re exhausted and confused and one of us is licking his testicles. Petfluencing is a pup\u2019s game. I do, however, have a fairly vivacious tortoise; perhaps Jeff could give us some tips?

      "body": "<p>Were they robbed? The row about Manchester international festival\u2019s <strong><a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/tree/\" title=\"\">Tree</a></strong> has tangled roots. It is hard from the sidelines to make out exactly what happened, but it\u2019s clear that the questions raised go beyond this production.</p> <p>Some things are not in dispute. Idris Elba wanted to base a piece of music theatre on his 2014 album <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/29/idris-elba-mi-mandela-music-inspired-by-roles\" title=\"\">Mi Mandela</a></em>. He worked on a stage adaptation with writers Tori Allen-Martin (who had performed on the album) and Sarah Henley. Some years later, Kwame Kwei-Armah, new artistic director of the Young Vic, was asked by MIF and Elba to join the project. <em>Tree</em> is now described as \u201c\u2018created by\u201d Elba and Kwei-Armah, who also directs.</p> <p>Were the two women, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/02/writers-claim-being-excluded-after-creating-idris-elbas-play\" title=\"\">as they say, pushed out and silenced</a>? Did they, as Kwei-Armah says, refuse to co-operate? Crucially \u2013 because more immediately provable \u2013 would the show as it now exists be different without their input? Allen-Martin and Henley are not claiming full-scale authorship: they dislike some aspects of the current version. But they made a cogent case on Radio 4\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0006lny\" title=\"\">Front Row</a></em> for central strands of their plot having survived in the finished version, and persuaded me that they are entitled to more credit than an also-ran acknowledgment in the programme. They have set up a company, <a href=\"https://www.burnbright.org.uk/2-ways-to-get-involved\" title=\"\">Burn Bright</a>, to support female writers, and raised their initial target of \u00a312,000 in two days. <a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/young-vic-issues-full-set-of-responses-to-tree-authorship-allegations/\" title=\"\">Kwei-Armah </a><a href=\"https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/young-vic-issues-full-set-of-responses-to-tree-authorship-allegations/\" title=\"\">has reiterated</a> that continuity between the current and former version is due to Elba\u2019s participation.</p> <p>Whatever the ins and outs here, the importance of asking who gets acclaimed \u2013 and how \u2013 in theatre is considerable. There is a side issue, too, for critics, which is not to do with historical input. I often wonder if, in attributing praise or blame to a director, I have actually got the right person. It\u2019s not always easy to detect who is responsible for a particular effect in a production.</p> <p>And <em>Tree</em> itself? This story of a young man, child of a black father and white mother, leaving London to discover a violent family history in South Africa, is in some senses pure MIF. It freewheels in a non-purpose-built space, with the audience on stage dancing at the beginning, and latterly standing for the 90-minute show. A green net spread out across the stage becomes the fronds of a tree; the audience clap to make the sound of thunder; the lights of mobile phones are held up like stars. As a soured grandmother, Sin\u00e9ad Cusack, brusque and rangy, catches the wariness and confidence of a woman who has spent years fending for herself and fending off truths. Yet vibrant moments do not make up for a script that is sometimes sketchy, sometimes overemphatic, rarely surprising: \u201cWhat do we do with all this hatred?\u201d \u201cLet it go.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"39d72946a3ab04238e4d5b02712ad1c1314e61fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39d72946a3ab04238e4d5b02712ad1c1314e61fd/0_0_4432_3088/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Invisible Cities at Manchester international festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Places transfigured by the memories and desires of inhabitants\u2019: Invisible Cities at Manchester international festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere at the festival, the clue to the difficulty of <strong><a href=\"https://mif.co.uk/whats-on/invisible-cities/\" title=\"\">Invisible Cities</a></strong> is in the title. In Italo Calvino\u2019s elusive, marvellous fiction, the emperor Kublai Khan is transfixed by places he never sees. Isolated in his palace, he listens as Marco Polo \u2013 storytelling for his life like a male Scheherazade \u2013 conjures up far-flung regions, sometimes leaping and gesturing to embody what he describes. Yet at the moment these cities become transfixingly real, their fabric evaporates: what are being evoked are mind maps, places transfigured by the memories and desires of inhabitants and visitors.</p> <p>It is extraordinary how much of this impossible task Leo Warner\u2019s production pulls off. In a move characteristic of MIF (this is a festival that really uses its city), the cavernous spaces of a deserted railway depot are transformed by the design of 59 Productions (of the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony). Tremendous videos dissolve the immediate surroundings with vertiginous closeups \u2013 bamboo, a swelling ocean near enough to make you seasick, dark underground caves, measureless to man, with rocks like rotting teeth. The studded iron pillars of the old station become palace adornments. As co-producers, Rambert supply dancers who embody Calvino\u2019s notion of architecture becoming animate. They are the living spaces of the cities and their residents, rising from the floor to swirl weightlessly around like litter. As monsters, they stick themselves together with multiple heads and limbs, which spring out from unexpected sockets; crouching and rising together, they blow across the stage like winds.</p> <p>Visually buoyant, the evening dips during the exchanges between Danny Sapani\u2019s Khan and Matthew Leonhart\u2019s Polo. Lolita Chakrabarti \u2013 whose version of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.comstage/2019/jul/14/life-of-pi-review-crucible-sheffield-lolita-chakrabarti\" title=\"\">Life of Pi</a></em> (reviewed by Clare Brennan is soaring in Sheffield \u2013 has impressively adapted Calvino\u2019s coiling and intricate prose to make something theatrically manageable. But though Sapani is arresting, Leonhart gabbles, and both are overwhelmed by an echoing acoustic and a booming sound design.

      "bodyText": "Were they robbed? The row about Manchester international festival\u2019s Tree has tangled roots. It is hard from the sidelines to make out exactly what happened, but it\u2019s clear that the questions raised go beyond this production. Some things are not in dispute. Idris Elba wanted to base a piece of music theatre on his 2014 album Mi Mandela. He worked on a stage adaptation with writers Tori Allen-Martin (who had performed on the album) and Sarah Henley. Some years later, Kwame Kwei-Armah, new artistic director of the Young Vic, was asked by MIF and Elba to join the project. Tree is now described as \u201c\u2018created by\u201d Elba and Kwei-Armah, who also directs. Were the two women, as they say, pushed out and silenced? Did they, as Kwei-Armah says, refuse to co-operate? Crucially \u2013 because more immediately provable \u2013 would the show as it now exists be different without their input? Allen-Martin and Henley are not claiming full-scale authorship: they dislike some aspects of the current version. But they made a cogent case on Radio 4\u2019s Front Row for central strands of their plot having survived in the finished version, and persuaded me that they are entitled to more credit than an also-ran acknowledgment in the programme. They have set up a company, Burn Bright, to support female writers, and raised their initial target of \u00a312,000 in two days. Kwei-Armah has reiterated that continuity between the current and former version is due to Elba\u2019s participation. Whatever the ins and outs here, the importance of asking who gets acclaimed \u2013 and how \u2013 in theatre is considerable. There is a side issue, too, for critics, which is not to do with historical input. I often wonder if, in attributing praise or blame to a director, I have actually got the right person. It\u2019s not always easy to detect who is responsible for a particular effect in a production. And Tree itself? This story of a young man, child of a black father and white mother, leaving London to discover a violent family history in South Africa, is in some senses pure MIF. It freewheels in a non-purpose-built space, with the audience on stage dancing at the beginning, and latterly standing for the 90-minute show. A green net spread out across the stage becomes the fronds of a tree; the audience clap to make the sound of thunder; the lights of mobile phones are held up like stars. As a soured grandmother, Sin\u00e9ad Cusack, brusque and rangy, catches the wariness and confidence of a woman who has spent years fending for herself and fending off truths. Yet vibrant moments do not make up for a script that is sometimes sketchy, sometimes overemphatic, rarely surprising: \u201cWhat do we do with all this hatred?\u201d \u201cLet it go.\u201d Elsewhere at the festival, the clue to the difficulty of Invisible Cities is in the title. In Italo Calvino\u2019s elusive, marvellous fiction, the emperor Kublai Khan is transfixed by places he never sees. Isolated in his palace, he listens as Marco Polo \u2013 storytelling for his life like a male Scheherazade \u2013 conjures up far-flung regions, sometimes leaping and gesturing to embody what he describes. Yet at the moment these cities become transfixingly real, their fabric evaporates: what are being evoked are mind maps, places transfigured by the memories and desires of inhabitants and visitors. It is extraordinary how much of this impossible task Leo Warner\u2019s production pulls off. In a move characteristic of MIF (this is a festival that really uses its city), the cavernous spaces of a deserted railway depot are transformed by the design of 59 Productions (of the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony). Tremendous videos dissolve the immediate surroundings with vertiginous closeups \u2013 bamboo, a swelling ocean near enough to make you seasick, dark underground caves, measureless to man, with rocks like rotting teeth. The studded iron pillars of the old station become palace adornments. As co-producers, Rambert supply dancers who embody Calvino\u2019s notion of architecture becoming animate. They are the living spaces of the cities and their residents, rising from the floor to swirl weightlessly around like litter. As monsters, they stick themselves together with multiple heads and limbs, which spring out from unexpected sockets; crouching and rising together, they blow across the stage like winds. Visually buoyant, the evening dips during the exchanges between Danny Sapani\u2019s Khan and Matthew Leonhart\u2019s Polo. Lolita Chakrabarti \u2013 whose version of Life of Pi (reviewed by Clare Brennan is soaring in Sheffield \u2013 has impressively adapted Calvino\u2019s coiling and intricate prose to make something theatrically manageable. But though Sapani is arresting, Leonhart gabbles, and both are overwhelmed by an echoing acoustic and a booming sound design. These words should not be wasted by being roared. In the tussle between Chekhov and Ibsen for dominance in British theatre, Chekhov has for years won out. As if suddenly we needed harsh truths, that is changing. There is a surge of Ibsen dramas \u2013 but Ibsen with a twist: Rosmersholm in a pungent new version; Wife, Samuel Adamson\u2019s take on A Doll\u2019s House; and still to come Cordelia Lynn\u2019s Hedda Tesman and Tanika Gupta\u2019s A Doll\u2019s House, set in colonial-era India. Now David Hare\u2019s Peter Gynt, styled as \u201cafter Henrik Ibsen\u201d. Hare has proved an exceptionally fluent adapter of other dramatist\u2019s plays. In transplanting to a rough 21st century this tale of a fantasist who exposes the phoney notion of a real self existing in isolation from other people, he keeps Ibsen\u2019s main tenets but translates them into our plastic personality culture, where everyone has \u201cstories, not lives\u201d. Gynt is in turn arms dealer, false prophet and Trump-style rampant rich person, who cheats on his own golf course. The dreaded (by me) troll sequences are plausibly rendered as the ghastly gobbledegook of his unconscious. Jonathan Kent\u2019s production \u2013 with troll-loving cowgirls swaggering on as a country and western trio \u2013 has a terrific central performance from James McArdle, who brims with braggadocio while suggesting glimmers of latent feeling in this anti-empathetic figure. He and Hare also make two episodes utterly extraordinary. Gynt\u2019s mother dies in his arms, laying down with relish her funeral requirements: readings from Ali Smith and Val McDermid. And Oliver Ford Davies, calm and unswerving, lights up the stage, as serene as he is implacable as he rolls up to tell Gynt it is time to die. Still, the play \u2013 particularly at this punitive two-interval length \u2013 poses intractable difficulties. It bolts together mythic extravaganza and over-insistent morality; its goods-train structure is ungainly, with one incident clanking along after another, loosely shackled together by Gynt\u2019s flimsy figure. Richard Hudson\u2019s perilously sloping design \u2013 glittering black cliffs and stretches of boggy green in Scotland, DayGlo posters in Florida \u2013 offers striking snapshots rather than the engulfing peculiarity which suggests a mental landscape as well as a satirical opportunity.

      "bodyText": "\u2022 The pianist Isata Kanneh-Mason identifies strongly with Clara Schumann, not only through her music but also through her large family. Clara had eight children. Isata has six siblings, all musical, including the cellist of the moment, her brother Sheku. In notes for her debut recording of Clara\u2019s work entitled Romance (Decca), Isata says: \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating that Clara could maintain such a long career as a pianist while having a large family and coping with the difficulties of her husband\u2019s mental illness. Her strength across her long life impressed, inspired and hugely intrigued me.\u201d That inspiration comes across loud and clear in her grand, sweeping interpretation of the Piano Concerto in A minor, a hugely virtuosic piece that Clara began writing at the age of 13. With conductor Holly Mathieson and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Kanneh-Mason brings real verve and excitement to both opening allegro and the romping finale. Her innate sense of shape and line are apparent again in the Piano Sonata in G minor, a work that, astonishingly, lay unpublished until 1991. Kanneh-Mason invests its singing opening with an almost reverential delicacy, interrupted with restless bursts of youthful energy, a quality she also brings to the glorious, turbulent Scherzo No 2 in C minor. \u2022 In 2016, the composer David Bednall wrote a Nunc dimittis that could be paired with Gerald Finzi\u2019s standalone Magnificat from 1952. It successfully draws on the rhapsodic contours of Finzi\u2019s distinctive technique while preserving Bednall\u2019s own lithe and attractive voice. It\u2019s included on Finzi, a recommended collection of his choral music, sacred and secular, recorded for Hyperion by Stephen Layton and the Choir of Trinity College, Cambridge. \u2022 Go to BBC Sounds to hear Donald Macleod in Radio 3\u2019s Composer of the Week tell the fascinating story of the rediscovery of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach\u2019s lost manuscripts in a Kiev basement in 1999. Originally housed in Berlin, the Nazis moved them to Poland where they promptly disappeared when the Red Army swept through, apparently saved by a Ukrainian tank driver but left forgotten for half a century.",

But Jake insists that he\u2019s \u201ca grownup\u201d and they are meant for each other. In fact, he says, they should start a family straight away.</p> <p>What follows is a beautifully observed slide from the romance of \u201cLet\u2019s just see what happens\u201d into the more testing waters of actively <em>trying</em> for a baby, with all the hopes and disappointments that ensue.

There\u2019s genuine tenderness here, along with the flirty excitement and heady rush of new love.

      "body": "<p>Summer reads, beach reads, holiday reads \u2026 at this time of year, the publishing world works itself into a sweat trying to force its novels into our carry-on luggage, or over the ether on to our Kindles. There are more books sold in the summer than during any other season: the well-established publishing calendar tends to see hardbacks released in the autumn to be given as gifts at Christmas, then repackaged as paperbacks in late spring. As Donna Harrington-Lueker sets out in her history of the beach read, <em>Books for Idle Hours</em>, the summer publishing rush is at least a century old, and has typically aimed \u201cairy and froth-like\u201d books on \u201cyoung ladies\u201d (the quote is from an 1888 work on summer books by Arlo Bates). The summer fiction market is changing, though, with more and more \u201cserious\u201d, \u201cliterary\u201d novels showing up where once there were only thrillers and crime novels, bonkbusters and romances. So it is that <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/01/normal-people-sally-rooney-review\" title=\"\">Normal People</a></em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/02/sally-rooney-interview-dont-respond-authority-normal-people\" title=\"\">Sally Rooney </a>is currently piled high on the tables of WH Smith\u2019s Travel alongside Lee Child, Jodi Picoult and Bernard Cornwell.</p> <p>I\u2019m aware of how contentious and porous discussions of genre can be. Generic labels, though, are the terms that booksellers and publishers think in and for literary novels, the chances of summer success are still relatively slim. Tom Tivnan, managing editor of the<em> Bookseller</em>, points to Nielsen BookScan data that shows that of the top 100 bestselling summer fiction titles in 2018 only seven were literary books. 2017 fared a bit better (12 of the top 100), 2016 had 10 of the top 100.

It\u2019s this latter phenomenon that Tom Tivnan believes to be of critical importance. \u201cThe books selected were not always literary fiction but often were \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jun/15/fiction.features1\" title=\"\">Brick Lane</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/aug/19/fiction.shopping2\" title=\"\">Half of a Yellow Sun</a></em>, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/fiction.asbyatt\" title=\"\">Cloud Atlas</a></em> \u2013 and sold in quantities they never would have had they not been selected for the list.

Almost every literary fiction title in the summer months in the past few years is there because it has been featured as a Waterstones book of the month.\u201d</p> <p>Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher at Dialogue Books, agrees with Tivnan that serious summer reading is a new phenomenon. \u201cI think the concept of a summer hit within literary fiction is still quite a new one. It only really happens once a book has found its legs as a hardback and had the autumn to pick up awards. When it comes out in paperback it needs to have enough awards, accolades and quotes attached to it that it makes the reader think \u2018This is something that I\u2019m going to try\u2019, rather than picking up something more commercial because that\u2019s what a summer read is, and that\u2019s what WH Smith is pushing.\u201d </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/02/the-power-naomi-alderman-review\" title=\"\">Naomi Alderman\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/02/the-power-naomi-alderman-review\" title=\"\">The Power</a></em> won the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/07/baileys-prize-naomi-alderman-the-power\" title=\"\">2017 Baileys prize</a>, sold many hundreds of thousands of copies and is being adapted for TV by Amazon.

It\u2019s got some things in common with books that discuss real-world news events like the wonderful <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/01/room-emma-donoghue-review-fritzl\" title=\"\">Room</a></em>. Many of us who heard about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/20/josef-fritzl-austria\" title=\"\">Josef Fritzl </a>could not stop trying to imagine what it was like to be in that awful basement room \u2013 we can never go there and we very much hope that the new identities of the people in the room are never revealed, so the only way to journey is in fiction and Emma Donoghue made the crossing for us.\u201d</p> <p>Jessie Burton\u2019s first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/29/the-miniaturist-jessie-burton-review\" title=\"\">The Miniaturist</a></em>, experienced a similar crossover success in 2014-15. It\u2019s not an obvious summer hit \u2013 a cool, eerie tale set in 17th-century Amsterdam. I asked Burton if the book\u2019s extraordinary sales \u2013 it was a No 1 bestseller in hardback and paperback \u2013 came as a surprise to her.</p> <p>\u201cOf course!\u201d she laughed. \u201cAs a debut novelist you\u2019re told again and again, \u2018You\u2019ll be lucky if you sell 500 hardbacks.\u2019 Before it was published, I\u2019d struggled to find the right agent for the book \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a given, this success. When something like that blows up, your initial reaction is gratitude, astonishment and not a little disorientation. Because you\u2019d never expected it to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Was there a particular moment when the book\u2019s spectacular rise hit home, I asked. She told me of seeing a huge billboard of the novel in Waterloo station and asking a train guard to take a picture of her in front of it. \u201cBut actually,\u201d she continued, \u201cit was when Geri Halliwell tweeted a picture of herself on her yacht, saying how much she had loved the book\u2026 ludicrous!\u201d Burton\u2019s next novel, <em>The Confession</em>, is out in September and already feels like a nailed-on hit for summer 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of Connie and Elise,\u201d she said, \u201ctwo women who go to California and hire a bungalow in West Hollywood. I wanted to set it among these Hockney swimming pools, where people were exhausted by 6pm because of the heat. It\u2019s a very heat-centric novel.\u201d</p> <p>The definitive summer smash of the past decade, David Nicholls\u2019s 2009 novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/one-day-david-nicholls-review\" title=\"\">One Day</a></em>, is a high-concept love story that sold 5m copies and was turned into a 2011 film starring Anne Hathaway. Nicholls\u2019s latest novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/08/sweet-sorrow-david-nicholls-review\" title=\"\">Sweet Sorrow</a></em>, is cut from the same cloth, and achieves the same powerful nostalgic sweep as its predecessor. I asked Nicholls what he enjoyed most about that glorious summer, when <em>One Day </em>often appeared to be the only book anyone was reading \u2013 on poolside loungers, under beach parasols, on the commuter trains of those left behind for the summer. \u201cThe high-water mark for me was seeing Audrey reading a copy in an episode of <em>Coronation Street</em>,\u201d he said.</p> <p>What does it feel like to see people reading his book in public, I wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s always extremely exciting and gratifying. I\u2019m sometimes tempted to say something \u2013 thank you very much \u2013 though you have to take on the possibility that they\u2019re absolutely hating it, that they\u2019re about to tut or sigh and give up, or hurl it to the floor. What if they have notes?\u201d</p> <p>Compiling our list of crossover hits of the past 10 years, it\u2019s striking that all but one of those to make the leap from literary to mainstream are by female authors. At one level it\u2019s not surprising \u2013 Tom Tivnan quotes a study that suggests that more than 70% of novels are bought by women. It used to be standard publishing lore that women bought fiction while men bought nonfiction. We ought to have moved beyond such blunt distinctions, argues Francis Bickmore, publishing director at Canongate.</p> <p>\u201cI find this gendering of fiction and nonfiction such a tiresome cliche,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of our big contemporary novelists appeal across the board. In 2019, the idea that men want to read serious nonfiction while women should distract themselves with a frivolous novel makes me want to be sick down myself. It\u2019s something that the book trade could do more about, from the way children\u2019s books are published to the way books are advertised.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"795890a1ceb00a8b2b4c13faa0a9c589b2a23fcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/795890a1ceb00a8b2b4c13faa0a9c589b2a23fcc/0_48_2025_1215/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anna Burns at the Man Booker prize ceremony with her winning novel The Milkman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anna Burns at the Man Booker prize ceremony with her winning novel The Milkman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as this summer goes, it\u2019s been all about Faber &amp; Faber to date. Two novels \u2013 <em>Normal People</em> and Anna Burns\u2019s Booker-winning <em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Milkman</a></em> have sold in extraordinary numbers, with both books routinely shifting 10,000 copies a week. Their success partly confirms many of the points made above \u2013 a combination of prizes, Waterstones and word of mouth.</p> <p>Alex Bowler, publisher at Faber, admits that such transformative successes can often come as a surprise even to the editors who commissioned them. \u201cYou hope that it\u2019s happening because of your publishing act, but more often than not it\u2019s outside that: the alchemical thing where a book connects with a culture and a zeitgeist and means it\u2019s piled high in summer promotions.\u201d What\u2019s important, though, is how the publisher responds to any initial signs of momentum building. \u201cWhen we sense that opportunity as publishers, when you feel it happening, you seize it and it informs how you publish the paperback.\u201d</p> <p>Returning to the thorny question of genre, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not all one-way traffic here \u2013 readers suddenly discarding the traditional staples of summer fiction in favour of more serious fare. It\u2019s also the case that literary fiction has been stepping more and more boldly into traditionally generic worlds. Tivnan notes that many of the most popular \u201ccrossover\u201d titles that have made the leap from literary to mainstream markets borrow elements from genre fiction that \u201ccan make them seem more mainstream\u201d. He cites \u201cthe science-fiction/speculative bits of [Colson Whitehead\u2019s] <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/09/the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead-revie-luminous-furious-wildly-inventive\" title=\"\">The Underground Railroad</a></em> and [Naomi Alderman\u2019s] <em>The Power</em>; the gothic, horror elements of Andrew Michael Hurley\u2019s<em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/23/the-loney-michael-andrew-hurley-review\" title=\"\"> The Loney</a></em>\u201d. To this you might add the supernatural subplot of <em>The Miniaturist</em>, and the way that, in another writer\u2019s hands, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/04/eleanor-oliphant-is-completely-fine-by-gail-honeyman-review\" title=\"\">Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine</a> </em>or <em>One Day </em>might have been generic romance novels. Perhaps what we\u2019re really talking about when we refer to literary fiction is work that pays attention to the sentence, to the choice of words, novels driven by art as well as plot. This makes for a broad church, taking in the best of genre fiction (and excluding many novels that think of themselves as \u201cliterary\u201d). That kind of summer reading is surely something we can all celebrate.</p> <h2><strong>A decade of summer crossover hits</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4b34d915cc67437e4cbf74e07bb32c4f81a776ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4b34d915cc67437e4cbf74e07bb32c4f81a776ff/0_0_181_278/181.png\" alt=\"One Day by David Nicholls\" width=\"181\" height=\"278\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>2010 David Nicholls, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/09/the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead-revie-luminous-furious-wildly-inventive\" title=\"\">One Day</a> (published 2009)</strong> <br> The quintessential summer hit, <em>One Day</em> told the story of Emma and Dexter, dropping into their lives every year on St Swithin\u2019s Day.

      "bodyText": "Summer reads, beach reads, holiday reads \u2026 at this time of year, the publishing world works itself into a sweat trying to force its novels into our carry-on luggage, or over the ether on to our Kindles. There are more books sold in the summer than during any other season: the well-established publishing calendar tends to see hardbacks released in the autumn to be given as gifts at Christmas, then repackaged as paperbacks in late spring. As Donna Harrington-Lueker sets out in her history of the beach read, Books for Idle Hours, the summer publishing rush is at least a century old, and has typically aimed \u201cairy and froth-like\u201d books on \u201cyoung ladies\u201d (the quote is from an 1888 work on summer books by Arlo Bates). The summer fiction market is changing, though, with more and more \u201cserious\u201d, \u201cliterary\u201d novels showing up where once there were only thrillers and crime novels, bonkbusters and romances. So it is that Normal People by Sally Rooney is currently piled high on the tables of WH Smith\u2019s Travel alongside Lee Child, Jodi Picoult and Bernard Cornwell. I\u2019m aware of how contentious and porous discussions of genre can be. Generic labels, though, are the terms that booksellers and publishers think in and for literary novels, the chances of summer success are still relatively slim. Tom Tivnan, managing editor of the Bookseller, points to Nielsen BookScan data that shows that of the top 100 bestselling summer fiction titles in 2018 only seven were literary books. 2017 fared a bit better (12 of the top 100), 2016 had 10 of the top 100. While this may make for sobering reading for \u201cserious\u201d novelists looking to finance the Proven\u00e7al writing retreat, their lot is significantly better than it used to be. Precise numbers for previous decades are hard to come by, but in the 1990s, for example, it was almost unheard of for a literary novel to cross over into the mainstream. Sebastian Faulks enjoyed just such a commercial success with his second book. \u201cIt was very unusual for something to cross over like The Girl at the Lion d\u2019Or did,\u201d Faulks says. \u201cThere was a much greater separation between the literary ghetto and the mainstream back then. The average sales of a literary novel in hardback were 1,500 and if you sold 10,000 in paperback, that was considered enormous. Only the very rare novel, like Hotel du Lac by Anita Brookner, would then get out of that literary niche.\u201d The wild success of Faulks\u2019s French trilogy \u2013 The Girl at the Lion d\u2019Or (1989), Birdsong (1993), and Charlotte Grey (1998) \u2013 were early proof of a fact now widely accepted in publishing: that literary novels would sell by the boatload if they were packaged and promoted correctly. Readerly adventurousness has been driven in part by the proliferation of prizes and partly through the enduring impact of book clubs like Richard and Judy\u2019s in the UK and Oprah\u2019s in the US. It\u2019s this latter phenomenon that Tom Tivnan believes to be of critical importance. \u201cThe books selected were not always literary fiction but often were \u2013 Brick Lane, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas \u2013 and sold in quantities they never would have had they not been selected for the list. This moved the goalposts for consumers \u2013 and retailers \u2013 in terms of what was a \u2018summer read\u2019.\u201d Another factor has been the renaissance of Waterstones and, in particular, the fiction book of the month promotion, which Tivnan says is \u201cmore important than prizes\u201d in that the book becomes \u201ca guaranteed bestseller for the month it is promoted by the chain. Almost every literary fiction title in the summer months in the past few years is there because it has been featured as a Waterstones book of the month.\u201d Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher at Dialogue Books, agrees with Tivnan that serious summer reading is a new phenomenon. \u201cI think the concept of a summer hit within literary fiction is still quite a new one. It only really happens once a book has found its legs as a hardback and had the autumn to pick up awards. When it comes out in paperback it needs to have enough awards, accolades and quotes attached to it that it makes the reader think \u2018This is something that I\u2019m going to try\u2019, rather than picking up something more commercial because that\u2019s what a summer read is, and that\u2019s what WH Smith is pushing.\u201d Naomi Alderman\u2019s The Power won the 2017 Baileys prize, sold many hundreds of thousands of copies and is being adapted for TV by Amazon. In an email, I asked her what it was about The Power that she thought propelled it over the parapet. \u201cThe Power is one of a type of literary novel that tries to talk about a large subject,\u201d she replied, \u201cone that many people have probably wondered and thought about, in my case: why are men and women\u2019s lives and social positions so different? It\u2019s got some things in common with books that discuss real-world news events like the wonderful Room. Many of us who heard about Josef Fritzl could not stop trying to imagine what it was like to be in that awful basement room \u2013 we can never go there and we very much hope that the new identities of the people in the room are never revealed, so the only way to journey is in fiction and Emma Donoghue made the crossing for us.\u201d Jessie Burton\u2019s first novel, The Miniaturist, experienced a similar crossover success in 2014-15. It\u2019s not an obvious summer hit \u2013 a cool, eerie tale set in 17th-century Amsterdam. I asked Burton if the book\u2019s extraordinary sales \u2013 it was a No 1 bestseller in hardback and paperback \u2013 came as a surprise to her. \u201cOf course!\u201d she laughed. \u201cAs a debut novelist you\u2019re told again and again, \u2018You\u2019ll be lucky if you sell 500 hardbacks.\u2019 Before it was published, I\u2019d struggled to find the right agent for the book \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a given, this success. When something like that blows up, your initial reaction is gratitude, astonishment and not a little disorientation. Because you\u2019d never expected it to happen.\u201d Was there a particular moment when the book\u2019s spectacular rise hit home, I asked. She told me of seeing a huge billboard of the novel in Waterloo station and asking a train guard to take a picture of her in front of it. \u201cBut actually,\u201d she continued, \u201cit was when Geri Halliwell tweeted a picture of herself on her yacht, saying how much she had loved the book\u2026 ludicrous!\u201d Burton\u2019s next novel, The Confession, is out in September and already feels like a nailed-on hit for summer 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s the story of Connie and Elise,\u201d she said, \u201ctwo women who go to California and hire a bungalow in West Hollywood. I wanted to set it among these Hockney swimming pools, where people were exhausted by 6pm because of the heat. It\u2019s a very heat-centric novel.\u201d The definitive summer smash of the past decade, David Nicholls\u2019s 2009 novel, One Day, is a high-concept love story that sold 5m copies and was turned into a 2011 film starring Anne Hathaway. Nicholls\u2019s latest novel, Sweet Sorrow, is cut from the same cloth, and achieves the same powerful nostalgic sweep as its predecessor. I asked Nicholls what he enjoyed most about that glorious summer, when One Day often appeared to be the only book anyone was reading \u2013 on poolside loungers, under beach parasols, on the commuter trains of those left behind for the summer. \u201cThe high-water mark for me was seeing Audrey reading a copy in an episode of Coronation Street,\u201d he said. What does it feel like to see people reading his book in public, I wondered. \u201cIt\u2019s always extremely exciting and gratifying. I\u2019m sometimes tempted to say something \u2013 thank you very much \u2013 though you have to take on the possibility that they\u2019re absolutely hating it, that they\u2019re about to tut or sigh and give up, or hurl it to the floor. What if they have notes?\u201d Compiling our list of crossover hits of the past 10 years, it\u2019s striking that all but one of those to make the leap from literary to mainstream are by female authors. At one level it\u2019s not surprising \u2013 Tom Tivnan quotes a study that suggests that more than 70% of novels are bought by women. It used to be standard publishing lore that women bought fiction while men bought nonfiction. We ought to have moved beyond such blunt distinctions, argues Francis Bickmore, publishing director at Canongate. \u201cI find this gendering of fiction and nonfiction such a tiresome cliche,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of our big contemporary novelists appeal across the board. In 2019, the idea that men want to read serious nonfiction while women should distract themselves with a frivolous novel makes me want to be sick down myself. It\u2019s something that the book trade could do more about, from the way children\u2019s books are published to the way books are advertised.\u201d As far as this summer goes, it\u2019s been all about Faber &amp; Faber to date. Two novels \u2013 Normal People and Anna Burns\u2019s Booker-winning Milkman have sold in extraordinary numbers, with both books routinely shifting 10,000 copies a week. Their success partly confirms many of the points made above \u2013 a combination of prizes, Waterstones and word of mouth. Alex Bowler, publisher at Faber, admits that such transformative successes can often come as a surprise even to the editors who commissioned them. \u201cYou hope that it\u2019s happening because of your publishing act, but more often than not it\u2019s outside that: the alchemical thing where a book connects with a culture and a zeitgeist and means it\u2019s piled high in summer promotions.\u201d What\u2019s important, though, is how the publisher responds to any initial signs of momentum building. \u201cWhen we sense that opportunity as publishers, when you feel it happening, you seize it and it informs how you publish the paperback.\u201d Returning to the thorny question of genre, it\u2019s clear that it\u2019s not all one-way traffic here \u2013 readers suddenly discarding the traditional staples of summer fiction in favour of more serious fare. It\u2019s also the case that literary fiction has been stepping more and more boldly into traditionally generic worlds. Tivnan notes that many of the most popular \u201ccrossover\u201d titles that have made the leap from literary to mainstream markets borrow elements from genre fiction that \u201ccan make them seem more mainstream\u201d. He cites \u201cthe science-fiction/speculative bits of [Colson Whitehead\u2019s] The Underground Railroad and [Naomi Alderman\u2019s] The Power; the gothic, horror elements of Andrew Michael Hurley\u2019s The Loney\u201d. To this you might add the supernatural subplot of The Miniaturist, and the way that, in another writer\u2019s hands, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine or One Day might have been generic romance novels. Perhaps what we\u2019re really talking about when we refer to literary fiction is work that pays attention to the sentence, to the choice of words, novels driven by art as well as plot. This makes for a broad church, taking in the best of genre fiction (and excluding many novels that think of themselves as \u201cliterary\u201d). That kind of summer reading is surely something we can all celebrate. A decade of summer crossover hits 2010 David Nicholls, One Day (published 2009) The quintessential summer hit, One Day told the story of Emma and Dexter, dropping into their lives every year on St Swithin\u2019s Day. High concept and beautifully written (like another big summer seller, Kate Atkinson\u2019s Life After Life (2013), One Day was named Galaxy book of the year and adapted by Nicholls into a film starring Anne Hathaway. 2011 Emma Donoghue, Room (published 2010) Inspired by the Josef Fritzl case, Room is told in the voice of the five-year-old Jack, trapped with his mother in a basement. S hortlisted for the Orange prize and the Booker, and was turned into a successful film in 2015. 2012 Madeleine Miller, The Song of Achilles (published 2011) Miller worked as a teacher of classics for the 10 years she spent writing this sexually charged retelling of the Iliad. A winner of the Orange prize, the novel was the bestselling debut novel of the year. 2013 Rachel Joyce, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry (published 2012) Another surprise hit, this quiet, charming novel of an old man\u2019s journey to see a former colleague on her deathbed was also the bestselling debut of the year, and longlisted for the Booker prize. An early incarnation of the \u201cup-lit\u201d (optimistic fiction) genre. 2014 Donna Tartt, The Goldfinch (published 2013) Tartt\u2019s debut, The Secret History, was a crossover 21 years earlier. The Goldfinch made the Bailey\u2019s shortlist, and became a global bestseller. A film starring Nicole Kidman is out in September. 2015 Jessie Burton, The Miniaturist (published 2014) Burton\u2019s novel of 17th-century Amsterdam, part coming-of-age narrative, part ghost story, was given a further boost by the excellent 2017 BBC adaptation. 2016 Hanya Yanagihara, A Little Life (published 2015) A hit in hardback and paperback, Yanagihara\u2019s brutal novel of sexual abuse and the long shadow it casts on the life of a New York lawyer was an unlikely bestseller. Shortlisted for the Booker and National Book Award and awarded a Kirkus prize, it offered proof that novels can be challenging and still draw in readers. 2017 Naomi Alderman, The Power (published 2016) The best feminist sci-fi story since The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, The Power is the fruit of Alderman\u2019s time being mentored by Margaret Atwood. It won the Bailey\u2019s prize, was chosen by Barack Obama as one of his books of the year and is to be filmed as a TV series after an 11-way rights auction. 2018 Gail Honeyman, Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine (published 2017) A surprise bestseller, Honeyman\u2019s first novel won the Costa debut novel award and has been optioned by Reese Witherspoon\u2019s film production company. 2019 Sally Rooney, Normal People (published 2018) The follow up to the superb Conversations With Friends, Rooney\u2019s second novel confirmed the 28-year-old as the biggest new name in literary fiction. The winner of the Costa best novel award, it was also longlisted for the Booker and chosen as the Waterstones book of the year. AP",

      "body": "<p>In her swansong appearances at the dispatch box, Theresa May is endeavouring to get in touch with her funny side. She recently tried mocking Jeremy Corbyn by <a href=\"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-07-10/debates/08BBDD0D-1A31-4BAD-8FC9-FC175B1D2081/Engagements\" title=\"\">quoting Groucho Marx</a>. \u201cThose are my principles, and if you don\u2019t like them... well, I have others.\u201d</p> <p>I expect most of the public take the Groucho view of politicians. In my experience, though, it is not true to say that their principles are endlessly mutable. Rather, what most politicians have is a hierarchy of convictions of varying degrees of flexibility.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Boris Johnson is the quintessential contemporary example of a man with many strong convictions, all weakly held</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the bottom of this hierarchy are the disposable convictions, things that politicians hold true only until they become inconvenient. Then they will be discarded in the pursuit of electoral gain, suppressed in service of party unity or subjugated to career ambition. Boris Johnson is the quintessential contemporary example of a man with many strong convictions, all weakly held.</p> <p>Then there are the higher principles. The things that a politician really does hold dear and will be prepared to self-sacrifice for. In defence of these convictions, they may rebel against the party whip, quit a frontbench job and jeopardise their prospects by infuriating the leader. One dramatic example of that was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/mar/17/labour.uk\" title=\"\">Robin Cook quitting</a> Tony Blair\u2019s cabinet over the Iraq war. Another was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/9/newsid_2516000/2516187.stm\" title=\"\">Michael Heseltine resigning</a> from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet over the Westland affair. They left government on a point of principle, but they remained within their respective parties.</p> <p>At the apex of the hierarchy is the first-order principle, a belief so important to a politician that he or she will even quit their party to uphold their convictions. Opposing racism is \u2013 or certainly ought to be \u2013 a first-order principle for any member of the Labour party. If the Labour party is about anything, it surely has to be about opposing racism in all its manifestations. And if it can\u2019t be relied on to do that, then it is no longer the Labour party. Three longstanding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/09/labour-peers-resign-over-handling-of-antisemitism-complaints-triesman-darzi-turnberg\" title=\"\">Labour peers have just quit</a> because they do not believe that Labour can be counted any more as a non-racist party. Lords Darzi, Triesman and Turnberg had thought that it was worth staying within the party to fight antisemitism, but all have now been compelled to the conclusion that the struggle is so hopeless that it is morally indefensible to remain as members. David Triesman, a former party general secretary, says that Labour has become \u201cvery plainly institutionally antisemitic\u201d and cannot be cleansed of this poison for so long as Jeremy Corbyn remains leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"afb3e89e05647a5169e6551a2c81ded5b6b59398\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afb3e89e05647a5169e6551a2c81ded5b6b59398/1215_330_1236_1544/801.jpg\" alt=\"David Triesman\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Triesman left Labour over its handling of antisemitism allegations.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McAndrew/UK Parliament</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lord Triesman is not alone in that view, further evidence for which was furnished by the <em>Panorama</em> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0006p8c/panorama-is-labour-antisemitic\" title=\"\">investigation featuring eight whistleblowers</a>, so distressed by what they had seen that some were driven into depression and one into contemplation of suicide. Their testimony was that they were fatally <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\" title=\"\">undermined in their attempts to tackle antisemitism</a> by members of the leader\u2019s entourage, who sought to downplay cases of anti-Jewish racism and dilute sanctions against it. To my mind, the aggressively denialist response to <em>Panorama</em> by the leadership was as revealing as the programme itself. Rather than regret what had come to light, apologise deeply and pledge urgent remedial action, Mr Corbyn\u2019s spinners, spokespeople and sock puppets denounced the BBC while trying to trash the former Labour staffers who were the programme\u2019s principal witnesses. As for the shadow cabinet, the kindest description of most of them is cowardly. The bulk of Labour\u2019s senior team has reacted to the antisemitism scandal with dumb silence, as if gagged with non-disclosure agreements. They have not been available to defend the leader and his inner circle; nor have they raised their voices to demand action before Labour\u2019s reputation, and by association their own, is irredeemably stained.</p> <p>An exception has been Tom Watson, the deputy leader, who has said that the \u201charrowing testimony\u201d in the programme is further evidence that \u201cthere is a sickness in our party\u201d. He is making a particular issue of the secretive manner in which Mr Corbyn\u2019s team are handling the investigation into anti-Jewish racism within Labour by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\" title=\"\">Equality and Human Rights Commission</a>. Mr Watson rightly says that it is outrageous that the national executive committee, the party\u2019s governing body, is not being given sight of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/11/labour-antisemitism-claims-automatic-exclusions-tom-watson\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s submission to the EHRC</a>. We can grasp why Mr Corbyn and his inner circle are being furtive about its contents. If it contains admissions that the party has developed a grave problem with antisemitism on his watch, that will be damaging. If the submission is an evasive and obfuscatory piece of work, maintaining that there is really nothing much to be troubled about, that will be even more damaging.</p> <p>The vast majority of Labour MPs are disgusted that their party has become a home for antisemites, appalled by the leadership\u2019s failure to deal with it properly, and frightened to say anything. This latest episode highlights the moral dilemma that is going to face them at the next general election, an event that could be upon them as early as this autumn. If they present themselves as Labour candidates at that election, they will have to go on doorsteps and before television cameras to recommend the installation of Mr Corbyn as prime minister and the promotion of his senior aides to some of the most powerful positions in the land. This will not be a bother for the minority of Labour MPs who think he will make an excellent prime minister, and who also maintain that the country will be safe, prosperous and tolerant in the hands of the Labour leader and his entourage. The moral dilemma is for the many more Labour MPs who believe he is absolutely unfit to be prime minister, for an array of reasons, and who further think that his inner cadre should not be allowed anywhere near the levers of power in Number 10.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29f2e62105daa4ab7f2806728fadd8d159995673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29f2e62105daa4ab7f2806728fadd8d159995673/489_379_1983_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, has called for robust action on antisemitism.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the election of 2017, Labour MPs parked their consciences and told themselves that it wasn\u2019t a real dilemma because Mr Corbyn was never going to be prime minister. They told Corbyn-wary voters that they distrusted him just as much as anyone, but it was safe to vote Labour because there was no chance of there being a Labour government.

      "bodyText": "In her swansong appearances at the dispatch box, Theresa May is endeavouring to get in touch with her funny side. She recently tried mocking Jeremy Corbyn by quoting Groucho Marx. \u201cThose are my principles, and if you don\u2019t like them... well, I have others.\u201d I expect most of the public take the Groucho view of politicians. In my experience, though, it is not true to say that their principles are endlessly mutable. Rather, what most politicians have is a hierarchy of convictions of varying degrees of flexibility. At the bottom of this hierarchy are the disposable convictions, things that politicians hold true only until they become inconvenient. Then they will be discarded in the pursuit of electoral gain, suppressed in service of party unity or subjugated to career ambition. Boris Johnson is the quintessential contemporary example of a man with many strong convictions, all weakly held. Then there are the higher principles. The things that a politician really does hold dear and will be prepared to self-sacrifice for. In defence of these convictions, they may rebel against the party whip, quit a frontbench job and jeopardise their prospects by infuriating the leader. One dramatic example of that was Robin Cook quitting Tony Blair\u2019s cabinet over the Iraq war. Another was Michael Heseltine resigning from Margaret Thatcher\u2019s cabinet over the Westland affair. They left government on a point of principle, but they remained within their respective parties. At the apex of the hierarchy is the first-order principle, a belief so important to a politician that he or she will even quit their party to uphold their convictions. Opposing racism is \u2013 or certainly ought to be \u2013 a first-order principle for any member of the Labour party. If the Labour party is about anything, it surely has to be about opposing racism in all its manifestations. And if it can\u2019t be relied on to do that, then it is no longer the Labour party. Three longstanding Labour peers have just quit because they do not believe that Labour can be counted any more as a non-racist party. Lords Darzi, Triesman and Turnberg had thought that it was worth staying within the party to fight antisemitism, but all have now been compelled to the conclusion that the struggle is so hopeless that it is morally indefensible to remain as members. David Triesman, a former party general secretary, says that Labour has become \u201cvery plainly institutionally antisemitic\u201d and cannot be cleansed of this poison for so long as Jeremy Corbyn remains leader. Lord Triesman is not alone in that view, further evidence for which was furnished by the Panorama investigation featuring eight whistleblowers, so distressed by what they had seen that some were driven into depression and one into contemplation of suicide. Their testimony was that they were fatally undermined in their attempts to tackle antisemitism by members of the leader\u2019s entourage, who sought to downplay cases of anti-Jewish racism and dilute sanctions against it. To my mind, the aggressively denialist response to Panorama by the leadership was as revealing as the programme itself. Rather than regret what had come to light, apologise deeply and pledge urgent remedial action, Mr Corbyn\u2019s spinners, spokespeople and sock puppets denounced the BBC while trying to trash the former Labour staffers who were the programme\u2019s principal witnesses. As for the shadow cabinet, the kindest description of most of them is cowardly. The bulk of Labour\u2019s senior team has reacted to the antisemitism scandal with dumb silence, as if gagged with non-disclosure agreements. They have not been available to defend the leader and his inner circle; nor have they raised their voices to demand action before Labour\u2019s reputation, and by association their own, is irredeemably stained. An exception has been Tom Watson, the deputy leader, who has said that the \u201charrowing testimony\u201d in the programme is further evidence that \u201cthere is a sickness in our party\u201d. He is making a particular issue of the secretive manner in which Mr Corbyn\u2019s team are handling the investigation into anti-Jewish racism within Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Mr Watson rightly says that it is outrageous that the national executive committee, the party\u2019s governing body, is not being given sight of Labour\u2019s submission to the EHRC. We can grasp why Mr Corbyn and his inner circle are being furtive about its contents. If it contains admissions that the party has developed a grave problem with antisemitism on his watch, that will be damaging. If the submission is an evasive and obfuscatory piece of work, maintaining that there is really nothing much to be troubled about, that will be even more damaging. The vast majority of Labour MPs are disgusted that their party has become a home for antisemites, appalled by the leadership\u2019s failure to deal with it properly, and frightened to say anything. This latest episode highlights the moral dilemma that is going to face them at the next general election, an event that could be upon them as early as this autumn. If they present themselves as Labour candidates at that election, they will have to go on doorsteps and before television cameras to recommend the installation of Mr Corbyn as prime minister and the promotion of his senior aides to some of the most powerful positions in the land. This will not be a bother for the minority of Labour MPs who think he will make an excellent prime minister, and who also maintain that the country will be safe, prosperous and tolerant in the hands of the Labour leader and his entourage. The moral dilemma is for the many more Labour MPs who believe he is absolutely unfit to be prime minister, for an array of reasons, and who further think that his inner cadre should not be allowed anywhere near the levers of power in Number 10. At the election of 2017, Labour MPs parked their consciences and told themselves that it wasn\u2019t a real dilemma because Mr Corbyn was never going to be prime minister. They told Corbyn-wary voters that they distrusted him just as much as anyone, but it was safe to vote Labour because there was no chance of there being a Labour government. The way things are at the moment, with Labour achieving the incredible feat of falling below the Tories in some polls, Labour MPs may again try to persuade themselves that this gets them off the moral hook. It\u2019s OK to endorse Labour, antisemitism and all, because we haven\u2019t a chance of winning. This sounds even more discreditable today than it did in 2017. And the way the polls are, with four parties each on around 20%, it can\u2019t be guaranteed that the vote will not split in a way that could send Mr Corbyn to Downing Street despite everything. A mirroring moral dilemma will face Tory MPs in the highly likely event of a Boris Johnson premiership. He has said he is prepared to crash Britain out of the EU on Halloween without a deal, a prospect that a significant cohort of Conservative MPs regard as grotesquely irresponsible. This autumn, these Tory MPs may have to choose between permitting a calamity Brexit or voting with the opposition to stop it, even if that means collapsing their own government. How far can their principles be stretched? In some cases, Tory consciences have a lot of elastic in their knickers. Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, who have previously been eloquently vocal about what a catastrophe a no-deal Brexit would be, are now sounding like people reconciled to the idea, a conversion that may not be entirely unconnected to the expectation that Mr Johnson will be picking the next cabinet. Others have been more consistent.

But that test may well come, and very soon. Both Labour and Conservative MPs are confronted with a career- and character-defining question, and it grows sharper by the week. When do they say to themselves that enough is enough? Where is the point when it becomes indefensible to stay within parties that are so abhorrent to their first-order principles?

A report that year by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/jeremy-corbyn-sets-up-inquiry-into-labour-antisemitism-claims\">Shami Chakrabarti</a>&nbsp;exonerated the party of widespread antisemitism but reported an 'occasionally toxic atmosphere'.</p>\n    <p>Matters escalated in 2018 when it became evident that the party was receiving more and more complaints, to the extent that there was a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/jan/20/jewish-labour-group-accuses-failing-act-antisemitism\">backlog of disciplinary cases</a>. Jeremy Corbyn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/aug/05/corbyn-sorry-for-hurt-inflicted-on-jewish-people-by-antisemitism-row-labour\">apologised that April</a>&nbsp;for hurt caused to the Jewish community by problems in the process and pointed to only 0.1% of members being under investigation for alleged antisemitic comments.</p>\n    <p>But the party was also mired in a row about whether to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism, which it&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/sep/04/labour-adopts-ihra-antisemitism-definition-in-full\">ended up ultimately approving</a>. Then accusations of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/02/new-labour-party-row-over-antisemitism-jeremy-corbyn\">political interference in the complaints process</a>&nbsp;by aides close to Corbyn began to emerge earlier this year, which the party strongly denies.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>When did the complaints about antisemitism turn into a full-blown crisis?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The resignations of some MPs and peers over antisemitism in February 2019 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/feb/28/labour-worst-day-shame-tom-watson-luciana-berger-resignation\">alarmed many Labour colleagues</a>. Then Chris Williamson, a Labour MP and ally of Corbyn, caused an outcry for saying that<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2019/feb/27/chris-williamson-says-labour-has-been-too-apologetic-about-antisemitism-video\">&nbsp;the party had been 'too apologetic' about antisemitism complaints</a>. However, many of his supporters in the party backed a campaign saying he had been vilified and badly treated. Then came the announcement that the Equalities and Human Rights Commission was placing the party&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/equality-body-launches-investigation-of-labour-antisemitism-claims\">under formal investigation</a>&nbsp;over antisemitism.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What allegations were made in the BBC Panorama documentary?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>In a July 2019 programme, eight whistleblowers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">spoke to a BBC Panorama documentary</a>, with some saying they felt there was political meddling from Corbyn\u2019s office in the process for handling antisemitism complaints. Seumas Milne, one of Corbyn\u2019s closest aides, told officials the party was 'muddling up political disputes with racism' and must review processes. Jennie Formby, the general secretary, was accused of attempting to interfere in who sat on a panel examining the case of Jackie Walker, a high-profile activist&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/27/labour-expels-jackie-walker-for-leaked-antisemitism-comments\">who was eventually expelled from the party</a>.<br></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What was Labour\u2019s response to the BBC\u2019s Panorama?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Labour&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/10/labour-bosses-accused-of-undermining-fight-against-antisemitism-bbc-panorama\">strongly denied the allegations</a>&nbsp;of political interference, and came out on the offensive, accusing the BBC of bias and calling for the documentary to be pulled.

This beautiful book, part memoir, part essay, covers everything from illness and disability to women\u2019s rights, activism and falling in love. It\u2019s private, it\u2019s public, it\u2019s political, it\u2019s funny and it\u2019s full of hope and determination, the kind you need when you are 28 and lying in a hospital bed with leukaemia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/02/constellations-reflections-from-life-sinead-gleeson-review\" title=\"\">She comes through it, obviously</a>, but with a difference, and that\u2019s what the book is about. It\u2019s something you can nibble at between novels or you can devour it quickly; the effect is the same, and the result is an uplifting account of being given a second chance. For a book that defies convention I would heartily recommend <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/29/leonard-and-hungry-paul-ronan-hession-review\" title=\"\">Leonard and Hungry Paul</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/29/leonard-and-hungry-paul-ronan-hession-review\" title=\"\"> by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession</a>. It\u2019s as simple as it is unique, the story of two young men living ordinary lives in an unnamed town, happy and for the most part fulfilled. One writes children\u2019s encyclopedias, the other works part time doing not very much. What makes it work? It is a celebration of kindness and having enough and being content \u2013 and living a life devoid of high drama and conflict. It\u2019s very funny, and well-written, poetic in places. But above all it\u2019s kind, a celebration of often overlooked people. <em>Helen With the High Hand</em> by Arnold Bennett is a forgotten classic, a light, comedic novella about what happens when Helen moves in with her miserly, estranged, elderly uncle and the ensuing battle of wills. Who runs the house? Where does the salt cellar sit? What time is bedtime? It\u2019s a wry, understated tale set in Stoke-on-Trent in 1910. Everything about it is old-fashioned, indeed Bennett was criticised by the Bloomsbury set even in his lifetime for his traditional attitudes. But this little domestic tale is full of tender heart, humour and wisdom. And it\u2019s very short. For all literary questions when we find ourselves at life\u2019s crossroads, I would recommend <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/18/novel-cure-elderkin-berthoud-review\" title=\"\">The Novel Cure </a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/18/novel-cure-elderkin-berthoud-review\" title=\"\">by Ella Berthoud and Susan Elderkin</a>. In this mini-reference book for all life\u2019s conditions, from apathy, through to first love, loneliness and \u201czestlessness\u201d, the authors recommend novel cures, books that speak to your ailment, that can help you navigate your situation and come out wiser (and better read) on the other side. It\u2019s a great present. Buy it for yourself.</p> <p><em>Kit de Waal</em><em>\u2019s novels include </em><em>My Name Is Leon and The Trick to Time</em><em> (Penguin).

So how about <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/04/why-be-happy-jeanette-winterson-review\" title=\"\">Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/04/why-be-happy-jeanette-winterson-review\" title=\"\"> by Jeanette Winterson</a>, the heartbreaking but at times hilarious life story of the author of <em>Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit</em>? Or, less well known: <em>Hackney Child </em>by Hope Daniels and Morag Livingstone. Hope walked into Stoke Newington police station with her brothers and asked to be taken into care. Both her parents were alcoholics; her mum a prostitute, and this is the tale of her escape. In a similar vein is Andrea Ashworth\u2019s <em>Once in a House on Fire</em>, in which Andrea finds refuge from a violent stepfather in works of literature. As in Winterson\u2019s memoir, amid the horror there is humour \u2013 and, from this reader at least, massive respect for the author\u2019s achievements in overcoming adversity. <em>Personal History</em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jul/18/guardianobituaries.pressandpublishing\" title=\"\">Katharine Graham</a> is also about huge achievement, albeit from a position of privilege. The <em>Washington Post</em> publisher\u2019s 1997 autobiography provides a fascinating insight into how she ruled the roost in a man\u2019s world. And finally <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/24/black-girl-woman-bible-elizabeth-uviebinene-yomi-adegoke-slay-your-lane\" title=\"\">Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible</a></em> by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinen\u00e9.

My list of suggestions would include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/03/seamusheaney\" title=\"\">Seamus Heaney\u2019s 144-page </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/03/seamusheaney\" title=\"\">translation of </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/nov/03/seamusheaney\" title=\"\">Beowulf</a></em> (the audiobook, which Heaney reads himself, is the only one I have ever finished then immediately restarted) and <em>Father and Son</em> by Edmund Gosse \u2013 just over 300 pages \u2013 which is an account of growing up as an only child in a Plymouth Brethren household in the mid-19th century with a mother who died early and a zoologist father who rejected the heretical ideas of Charles Darwin. There have since been a number of autobiographies by writers brought up in stern, evangelical families but this warm, acute, funny, sad book remains, I think, the best. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/fromthearchives.virginiawoolf\" title=\"\">Jacob\u2019s Room</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/20/fromthearchives.virginiawoolf\" title=\"\"> by Virginia Woolf</a> was published in 1922, the same year as <em>Ulysses </em>and <em>The Wasteland</em>. It doesn\u2019t flaunt its cleverness but is as rich and deep and wise as either and is around the 300-page mark. My copy has more excited biro underlining than any other book I own. Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">Robert Musil\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28\" title=\"\">The Man Without Qualities</a></em> (well over 1,000 pages) is a book to be read while in traction after a serious leg-break.</p> <p><em>Mark Haddon\u2019s latest novel is Porpoise (Chatto)</em></p> <h2>* * *</h2> <h2><strong>Q: </strong>Is <em>War and Peace</em> a book for a vacation?

Besides, Tolstoy\u2019s short fiction, especially his masterpiece, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jul/28/tolstoy-death-ivan-ilyich-devil-review\" title=\"\">The Death of Ivan Ilyich</a></em>, for instance, is just as brilliant.

With male characters as complex as female ones, and the patriarchal narrative given a healthy throttling, you can practically feel modern romance evolving as you\u2019re reading it.

The book reads like a cross between Dumas, Walter Scott and Horace Walpole: it\u2019s racy, gothic melodrama set in 1628-30, with young love obstructed by the politicking of foreign oppressors, priests, aristocrats and lawyers. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview30\" title=\"\">Stendhal</a>\u2019s <em>The Charterhouse of Parma </em>is tighter and cooler: set between Lake Como and Parma, it\u2019s both a love story and a portrait of the astonishing cynicism of court life.

Brexistentialists might masochistically enjoy <em>Timon of Athens</em>, a satiric fable about the collapse of financial and social bonds. For escapists, <em>The Merry Wives of Windsor </em>shows mature women asserting their automony, set in a provincial town that has managed to retain its comic French physician, Dr Caius, despite the nationwide exodus of EU medical professionals. And if you hope that Shakespeare might have an answer, try the late play <em>Cymbeline</em>. Britain decides to withhold monies payable to a shadowy European power, and goes to war to protect its sovereignty. Despite winning, they agree to pay up, and to fly the Roman and British flags together over London. If that all sounds a bit pie-in-the-sky, this is a play founded on wonderful impossibilities.

Virgil\u2019s <em>The Aeneid </em>has held me in its grip since I read Book 2 for GCSE Latin. The Trojan horse, the fall of the city, sea snakes: it has it all.

      "bodyText": "Q: I will be travelling alone later this summer for the first time after losing my husband a year ago. I am an avid reader; it\u2019s my therapy. Please could you recommend something inspirational, calming and life-affirming to accompany me into the future? A tall order, I know! Sarah Sprater, 55, British-born language teacher, Germany A: Kit de Waal, novelist If ever there was an affirmation of life, it\u2019s Constellations by Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson. This beautiful book, part memoir, part essay, covers everything from illness and disability to women\u2019s rights, activism and falling in love. It\u2019s private, it\u2019s public, it\u2019s political, it\u2019s funny and it\u2019s full of hope and determination, the kind you need when you are 28 and lying in a hospital bed with leukaemia. She comes through it, obviously, but with a difference, and that\u2019s what the book is about. It\u2019s something you can nibble at between novels or you can devour it quickly; the effect is the same, and the result is an uplifting account of being given a second chance. For a book that defies convention I would heartily recommend Leonard and Hungry Paul by R\u00f3n\u00e1n Hession. It\u2019s as simple as it is unique, the story of two young men living ordinary lives in an unnamed town, happy and for the most part fulfilled. One writes children\u2019s encyclopedias, the other works part time doing not very much. What makes it work? It is a celebration of kindness and having enough and being content \u2013 and living a life devoid of high drama and conflict. It\u2019s very funny, and well-written, poetic in places. But above all it\u2019s kind, a celebration of often overlooked people. Helen With the High Hand by Arnold Bennett is a forgotten classic, a light, comedic novella about what happens when Helen moves in with her miserly, estranged, elderly uncle and the ensuing battle of wills. Who runs the house? Where does the salt cellar sit? What time is bedtime? It\u2019s a wry, understated tale set in Stoke-on-Trent in 1910. Everything about it is old-fashioned, indeed Bennett was criticised by the Bloomsbury set even in his lifetime for his traditional attitudes. But this little domestic tale is full of tender heart, humour and wisdom. And it\u2019s very short. For all literary questions when we find ourselves at life\u2019s crossroads, I would recommend The Novel Cure by Ella Berthoud and Susan Elderkin. In this mini-reference book for all life\u2019s conditions, from apathy, through to first love, loneliness and \u201czestlessness\u201d, the authors recommend novel cures, books that speak to your ailment, that can help you navigate your situation and come out wiser (and better read) on the other side. It\u2019s a great present. Buy it for yourself. Kit de Waal\u2019s novels include My Name Is Leon and The Trick to Time (Penguin). She also edited Common People, a recent collection of essays, poems and memoir (Unbound) * * * Q: I am looking for the perfect political thriller or crime novel for my summer reading. Preferably a book with links to global politics and international relations and even better if it had a feminist twist. Sini Maria, London A: Jonathan Freedland, Guardian columnist and thriller writer Modesty prevents me from suggesting To Kill the Truth by my alter ego, Sam Bourne, as the answer to your prayers \u2013 even though it ticks those boxes, with a female protagonist, former White House operative Maggie Costello, tackling a global conspiracy. Meanwhile, Tom Bradby\u2019s Secret Service administers a strong dose of international politics with an all-too-plausible premise, and Mick Herron\u2019s splendid creation, the MI5 rejects of Slough House led by the repellently brilliant Jackson Lamb, return in Joe Country. A Fatal Game by Nicholas Searle is a spy thriller with extra authority: the author served in British intelligence for more than 25 years. Not political exactly, but Denise Mina\u2019s Conviction offers a dark twist on the true crime podcast, while JP Delaney\u2019s The Perfect Wife, out in early August, promises first-rate psychological suspense. Jonathan Freedland\u2019s Sam Bourne series is published by Quercus * * * Q: I enjoy reading real-life stories of inspirational women, such as Michelle Obama\u2019s Becoming and The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, and am looking for a new one for this summer. Last year\u2019s holiday read to beat was Educated by Tara Westover. Saskia Volders, 44, career coach, Swansea A: Cathy Newman, presenter of Channel 4 News There are so many stories by wonderfully inspirational women, the only difficulty is narrowing down the selection. So how about Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal? by Jeanette Winterson, the heartbreaking but at times hilarious life story of the author of Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit? Or, less well known: Hackney Child by Hope Daniels and Morag Livingstone. Hope walked into Stoke Newington police station with her brothers and asked to be taken into care. Both her parents were alcoholics; her mum a prostitute, and this is the tale of her escape. In a similar vein is Andrea Ashworth\u2019s Once in a House on Fire, in which Andrea finds refuge from a violent stepfather in works of literature. As in Winterson\u2019s memoir, amid the horror there is humour \u2013 and, from this reader at least, massive respect for the author\u2019s achievements in overcoming adversity. Personal History by Katharine Graham is also about huge achievement, albeit from a position of privilege. The Washington Post publisher\u2019s 1997 autobiography provides a fascinating insight into how she ruled the roost in a man\u2019s world. And finally Slay in Your Lane: The Black Girl Bible by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinen\u00e9. There are many self-help manuals by white women. This one is by two black women \u2013 and it\u2019s the business! Cathy Newman is the author of Bloody Brilliant Women: the Pioneers, Revolutionaries and Geniuses Your History Teacher Forgot to Mention (William Collins) * * * Q: I often find myself returning from holiday with the big book I took with me unread. Unfinished classics litter my book shelves, which makes me feel guilty. Can you suggest some shorter novels or collections of short stories that might suit this year? Lachlan Fotheringham, psychiatry trainee, 29, Newcastle A: Mark Haddon, novelist It is possible to tick off a few literary classics without devoting six months of spare time to each one. My list of suggestions would include Seamus Heaney\u2019s 144-page translation of Beowulf (the audiobook, which Heaney reads himself, is the only one I have ever finished then immediately restarted) and Father and Son by Edmund Gosse \u2013 just over 300 pages \u2013 which is an account of growing up as an only child in a Plymouth Brethren household in the mid-19th century with a mother who died early and a zoologist father who rejected the heretical ideas of Charles Darwin. There have since been a number of autobiographies by writers brought up in stern, evangelical families but this warm, acute, funny, sad book remains, I think, the best. Jacob\u2019s Room by Virginia Woolf was published in 1922, the same year as Ulysses and The Wasteland. It doesn\u2019t flaunt its cleverness but is as rich and deep and wise as either and is around the 300-page mark. My copy has more excited biro underlining than any other book I own. Meanwhile, Robert Musil\u2019s The Man Without Qualities (well over 1,000 pages) is a book to be read while in traction after a serious leg-break. Mark Haddon\u2019s latest novel is Porpoise (Chatto) * * * Q: Is War and Peace a book for a vacation? If not, what is the best classic for a summer read? Anonymous, Cheshire A: Robert McCrum, writer I favour a holiday book that\u2019s neither a chore nor a burden, and I worry that War and Peace (especially in the wrong translation) might be both, and end up, like the worst of good intentions, a half-explored, semi-digested, reproach. Besides, Tolstoy\u2019s short fiction, especially his masterpiece, The Death of Ivan Ilyich, for instance, is just as brilliant. For another classic short novel you might finish before take-off, but can savour and reread in the sunshine with a glass of white wine, I\u2019d sneak a copy of Muriel Spark\u2019s The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie into my back pocket. Alternative safe bets: The Code of the Woosters (PG Wodehouse); The Great Gatsby (F Scott Fitzgerald); and Emma (Jane Austen). Wild cards: Moby-Dick (Herman Melville); Hadrian the Seventh (Frederick Rolfe); Three Men in a Boat (Jerome K Jerome). And topical nonfiction: The Right Stuff (Tom Wolfe). Robert McCrum was the Observer\u2019s literary editor; his most recent book is Every Third Thought: On Life, Death and the Endgame (Picador) * * * Q: Can you recommend a few books for a cheap and cheerful weekend getaway with the girls in London? We can\u2019t afford to go abroad. Anonymous lawyer, 29, West Yorkshire A: Emma Jane Unsworth, novelist Strip off and dive into In at the Deep End by Kate Davies. As refreshing as an outdoor pool in 40-degree heat, this is the brazen and hilarious tale of one woman\u2019s lesbian sexual awakening in the city you\u2019ll be in. Also set in London, Our Stop by Laura Jane Williams offers another dose of smart, sisterly storytelling. With male characters as complex as female ones, and the patriarchal narrative given a healthy throttling, you can practically feel modern romance evolving as you\u2019re reading it. If escapism is more your bag, My House in Umbria by William Trevor is a stunningly beautiful novella about a romantic novelist with a tragic past. Languid, lush and poignant, it will transport you to central Italy and restore your faith in humanity, which is more than can be said for most airports. Finally, time for a wild ride through Los Angeles. Strap in for Postcards from the Edge, Carrie Fisher\u2019s semi-autobiographical novel about rehab, Hollywood, and mother-daughter rivalry. It\u2019s a masterclass in voice, and a book with all the thrills and spills of a 747. There. Forget flights. Buy books. Animals, a film version of Emma Jane Unsworth\u2019s 2014 novel of the same name, is in UK cinemas in August. Her next novel, Adults (Borough Press), will be published in February * * * Q: My son is 11. We are going on a campervan holiday to Slovenia that will involve a lot of driving time and therefore a lot of books. He likes to read series. He\u2019s read Percy Jackson, everything by Anthony Horowitz and all the other obvious ones. And while he might be keen, I think he might be a bit young for dystopian YA . Any suggestions? Ruth Johnson, researcher, 48 Manchester A: Patrice Lawrence, YA author If your son likes series (and Percy Jackson), start with Maz Evans\u2019s series Who Let the Gods Out? Human boy Elliot and zodiac goddess Virgo battle a tricksy death daemon, helped by various Olympians. It hits that enviable sweet spot making adults and children laugh out loud. I\u2019ve always loved crime books and in Sharna Jackson\u2019s High Rise Mystery, sisters Nik and Norva investigate the murder of their art teacher, Hugh, on a south London estate. There\u2019s more to come from them. Another first-in-a-series and very funny is Planet Omar: Accidental Trouble Magnet by Zanib Mian, inspired by Wimpy Kid and Tom Gates. It contains a bully, a dragon and a little brother who screams like a siren. Finally, a standalone. Sita Brahmachari\u2019s Where The River Runs Gold, a compelling read about siblings seeking the truth in an alternative, ecologically challenged world, where food is controlled by one shady organisation. Close to but not quite dystopian YA. Patrice Lawrence is the author of Orangeboy and Indigo Donut (Hodder Children\u2019s Books), and other YA books * * * Q: I\u2019m feeling overwhelmed by all the constant hard-hitting news. Can you recommend me a really engrossing, sweeping, escapist read for my summer break? Laura, 30, Wales A: Julie Myerson, novelist I hesitate to call it escapist \u2013 it\u2019s satire of the most bitingly enjoyable kind \u2013 but if you want a big, fat, darkly funny read, which keeps you guessing until its bitter and startling end, look no further than Mark Lawson\u2019s (to my mind, underrated) page-turner The Deaths. Similarly, Sarah Waters\u2019s astounding Fingersmith is one of those novels that convinces, grips and twists you in its silken clutches. And if you love that, try Wilkie Collins\u2019s The Woman in White, written a century and a half earlier and no less urgent and captivating. A tiny jewel of a novel, but sweeping in its power and scope, is Carys Davies\u2019s West, an unforgettably epic tale of settlers and monsters. Finally, the last time that, sunk so deep in a novel, I almost forgot to eat, sleep, breathe, was with Somerset Maugham\u2019s 1915 masterpiece Of Human Bondage. Emotionally daring, constantly real and ultimately deeply moving, it\u2019s hard to believe this wasn\u2019t written yesterday. I envy anyone who has yet to read it. Julie Myerson\u2019s latest novel is The Stopped Heart (Vintage) * * * Q: What can I read to immerse myself (metaphorically) in Lake Como? Fiona Salt, 43, English teacher, Lancashire Q: Can you suggest novels set in Italy, particularly Milan, Turin, the lakes, Genoa or the Riviera? Anne Gray, 60, retired, London A: Tobias Jones, writer Alessandro Manzoni\u2019s The Betrothed is considered the great Italian novel: set around Lake Como, Monza and Milan, it tells the story of an engaged couple whose wedding plans are thwarted by the dastardly Don Rodrigo. The book reads like a cross between Dumas, Walter Scott and Horace Walpole: it\u2019s racy, gothic melodrama set in 1628-30, with young love obstructed by the politicking of foreign oppressors, priests, aristocrats and lawyers. Stendhal\u2019s The Charterhouse of Parma is tighter and cooler: set between Lake Como and Parma, it\u2019s both a love story and a portrait of the astonishing cynicism of court life. If you prefer noir to historical fiction, Giancarlo De Cataldo, Gianrico Carofiglio and Maurizio De Giovanni are contemporary novelists who offer realistic glimpses into the Italian underworld. Sometimes you get both genres combined: Alberto Moravia\u2019s The Conformist, Natalia Ginzburg\u2019s The Things We Used to Say and Giorgio Bassani\u2019s The Garden of the Finzi-Continis show the consequences of extremism on the personal and vice versa. The elegiac lightness of the latter two makes the grotesque shadow of fascism seem somehow less domineering. Tobias Jones writes fiction and nonfiction and lives in Italy. His latest book is A Place of Refuge: An Experiment in Communal Living (Quercus) * * * Q: Which Shakespeare do you recommend for summer 2019? Carry Schneider, 50, English and drama teacher, Germany A: Emma Smith, professor of Shakespeare studies, Oxford University This depends on whether you want to embrace, interrogate, or deny the chaos around us. Brexistentialists might masochistically enjoy Timon of Athens, a satiric fable about the collapse of financial and social bonds. For escapists, The Merry Wives of Windsor shows mature women asserting their automony, set in a provincial town that has managed to retain its comic French physician, Dr Caius, despite the nationwide exodus of EU medical professionals. And if you hope that Shakespeare might have an answer, try the late play Cymbeline. Britain decides to withhold monies payable to a shadowy European power, and goes to war to protect its sovereignty. Despite winning, they agree to pay up, and to fly the Roman and British flags together over London. If that all sounds a bit pie-in-the-sky, this is a play founded on wonderful impossibilities. But actor Harriet Walter described how for the play\u2019s heroine, Innogen, \u201cthe will to believe makes you keep going, even though all the time events are against you\u201d. Wise words this summer. Emma Smith is the author of several books about Shakespeare, including This Is Shakespeare (Pelican) * * * Q: What Greek or Roman classics to read in the summer? Anonymous student, Sussex A: Natalie Haynes, writer Sappho wrote thousands of lines of lyric poetry, almost all of which are lost, but we do have three relatively complete poems and multiple fragments of varying lengths. Anne Carson\u2019s If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho presents the Greek on parallel pages to her excellent, elegant translations. It is dazzling to see how much beauty can be found in even the smallest scraps of verse. I have been thinking about collective madness recently: what makes a crowd suddenly adopt the same delusion? Euripides\u2019 The Bacchae asks this question (and many others). As so often, the Penguin classic (translated by Philip Vellacott) is excellent. Virgil\u2019s The Aeneid has held me in its grip since I read Book 2 for GCSE Latin. The Trojan horse, the fall of the city, sea snakes: it has it all. Book 4 is Dido and Aeneas, one of the greatest love stories. Robert Fagles\u2019s translation is pretty good (but can we persuade Emily Wilson, the amazing translator of Homer\u2019s Odyssey, to do this next?). Natalie Haynes is an author, critic, broadcaster and classicist. Her latest book, A Thousand Ships (Mantle), is a retelling of the Trojan war from an all-female perspective * * * Q: Can you recommend any nonfiction books tackling race-related issues? I would love to keep informed while still enjoying summer prose. Anonymous student, 18, Manila, Philippines A: Johny Pitts, writer and broadcaster It\u2019s a hot summer, so I\u2019m going to suggest some cool and nuanced analysis. Race is a construct, and Robin DiAngelo\u2019s White Fragility is a refreshing look at how a white \u201crace\u201d that often operates from a normalised non-racialised position has been used to create a racial hierarchy and, crucially, how it might be deconstructed. Angela Saini\u2019s Superior: The Return of Race Science eloquently explores the vehicle through which such racist logic has and is once again being pushed. There have been some important rereleases of timeless anti-racist classics recently. Frantz Fanon\u2019s Black Skin, White Masks shows whiteness in action through the system of colonialism, and the damage done to the psychology of its colonised subjects. And a new generation of thinkers are arming themselves with Audre Lorde\u2019s endlessly quotable Sister Outsider, counteracting racism with an intersectional approach, at the crossroads of race, gender, and sexuality. Johny Pitts\u2019s Afropean: Notes from Black Europe (Allen Lane) was published in May * * * Q: What should I read on a wet camping holiday in Scotland? I am fond of the coming-of-age genre and need something to cheer me up after reading Stoner by John Williams Holly, 32, student, Manchester A: Anthony Quinn, novelist Camping, eh? Your hardy nature might appreciate Kidnapped, RL Stevenson\u2019s magnificent tale of David Balfour\u2019s coming of age and adventures as a fugitive in the Highlands. His volatile friendship with the Jacobite Alan Breck is immortal, and their reconciliation scene after a bust-up had me sobbing my heart out. You can also use the book to flap away the midges. In The Ghost Writer, Philip Roth introduced his alter ego Nathan Zuckerman as a 23-year-old, seeking out his reclusive hero in rural Massachusetts. It\u2019s a brilliant and unsettling story of a young writer finding his voice. As the ultimate battle for a soul, Edmund Gosse\u2019s Father and Son is a must - one of the funniest, and saddest, memoirs ever written. Bonjour Tristesse made its author, Fran\u00e7oise Sagan, an overnight sensation in 1954 and fixed her spoilt teenage narrator Cecile permanently in the minds of readers. On getting home (hooray!) you can watch Otto Preminger\u2019s superb movie of it starring Jean Seberg and Deborah Kerr. I hope it\u2019s not too wet up in Scotland, Holly, and that these books will see off your post-Stoner blues. Anthony Quinn\u2019s novels include Freya and Our Friends in Berlin (Vintage) * * * Q: I am going on a trip through Russia, Estonia, Latvia and Poland \u2013 what books would you recommend (particularly with some Soviet history, but not necessarily nonfiction)? Hannah Fergusson, 21, law student, Edinburgh A: Luke Harding, journalist and writer I\u2019m a great fan of the Finnish-Estonian writer Sofia Oksanen. She\u2019s a publishing sensation (2m books sold) whose subject matter \u2013 the Soviet occupation of the Baltics \u2013 might seem a little daunting. In fact, her novels Purge and When the Doves Disappeared are brilliantly readable and very sharp. Oksanen writes about the divergent fates of collaborators and resisters and Estonian rural life: pancakes, sugar beet soup and jam-making. Her villains go from Vladivostok sex traffickers to secret policemen. Vasily Grossman\u2019s Stalingrad is just out in English and can now be read with his follow-on masterpiece Life and Fate. The two books show the Soviet Union under German attack. There are soldiers and commissars; nuclear scientists and miners; kolkhoz workers and women medics. Grossman gives voice to the millions lost in the \u201charsh whirlwind\u201d \u2013 with love affairs, family rows and chilling close-ups of Hitler and Stalin. Both books are big. You will need a rucksack. Slender, and more playful, is Imperium by Polish journalist Ryzyard Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski. Kapu\u015bci\u0144ski stirs debate. Are his works factual accounts or magical interpretations? Nonfiction or not quite, it is a riveting chronicle of the dying days of the USSR and its collapse into a kaleidoscope of new states and rivalries. It is wonderful, luminous, and questing: the work of a genius-reporter at the height of his power. Luke Harding is a Guardian foreign correspondent who was based in Russia from 2007 to 2011. His books include Collusion: How Russia Helped Trump Win the White House * * * Q: I\u2019m travelling to southern Tuscany for my honeymoon in August. We will be staying at a very quiet place in a little hill town with hammocks and long views. There will be lots of time to read. I like reading pacey, character-led novels but I don\u2019t want to burst the honeymoon bubble with one that is dark, violent or too sad. I have The Enchanted April and The Leopard on my shortlist but want more. Please advise! Anonymous social sciences academic, south-east London A: Bernardine Evaristo, novelist Because you already have two books based in Italy I\u2019ve selected novels set in tropical climates for you to enjoy while you\u2019re basking in the Tuscan sunshine; all are fast-moving and character-driven. Song, a powerful debut by Michelle Jana Chan is the beautifully described story of an impoverished Chinese boy who sails to Guyana and rises, against all odds, to lead an exceptional life. De Rightest Place by Barbara Jenkins is another recent debut Caribbean novel, about a woman managing a bar in Trinidad with a host of extraordinary characters passing through. The writing is exciting and the storyline totally original. The Secret Lives of Baba Segi\u2019s Wives by Lola Shoneyin is a subversive take on polygamy in Nigeria. It centres on a domestic despot who has no idea what his four wives are getting up to as they cunningly plot to survive marriage to him. Moving over to Uganda, Maggie Gee\u2019s My Driver is an amusing and insightful take on power relations between a Ugandan cleaner and her former London boss. Both women starred in its equally funny prequel, My Cleaner. Bernardine Evaristo is a novelist, poet, critic, dramatist and essayist. Her most recent novel is, Girl, Woman, Other (Hamish Hamilton)",

Brilliant, readable nonfiction is out there too: <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/16/white-fragility-racism-interview-robin-diangelo\" title=\"\">White Fragility</a></em> by Robin DiAngelo (Penguin) examines how white people attempt to prevent anti-racism measures, knowingly and unknowingly, and suggests how to challenge such behaviour in ourselves and others. Written in a no-nonsense, concise fashion, this is a must-read if you want to be an ally rather than an enemy.

In <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review\" title=\"\">Girl, Woman, Other</a></em> (Hamish Hamilton), Bernardine Evaristo weaves together the stories of a range of women across continents. It\u2019s a magnificent read from a writer with a gift for humanity. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/12/10-minutes-38-seconds-in-this-strange-world-by-elif-shafak-review\" title=\"\">10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World</a></em> by Elif Shafak (Viking) is a brave, moving book, which captures the diversity of modern Turkey from one of its great writers. <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/22/silence-of-the-girls-pat-barker-book-review-iliad\" title=\"\">The Silence of the Girls</a></em> (Penguin) is Pat Barker\u2019s brilliant retelling of Homer\u2019s <em>Iliad</em> through the eyes of Briseis, where women have the voice \u2013 unputdownable. Poetry books are ideal to pack. My current favourites are: <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/perseverance.html\" title=\"\">The Perseverance</a> </em>by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/27/deaf-poet-raymond-antrobus-wins-ted-hughes-prize\" title=\"\">Raymond Antrobus</a> (Penned in the Margins) \u2013 amazing work from the award-winning, deaf, spoken-word poet; and <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/fierce-fairytales.html\" title=\"\">Fierce Fairytales</a></em> by Nikita Gill (Orion), feminist fairy stories retold through verse.</p> <p><strong>Gill Walker, bookseller</strong><br>My favourite book this year so far is <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/dec/06/home-is-a-state-of-mind-you-dont-need-walls\" title=\"\">The Salt Path</a></em> by Raynor Winn (Penguin), an inspirational and lyrically observed memoir on the regenerative power of walking in nature, as well as a reminder that material things are much less important than we sometimes think. If you love the landscape of the British coastline and are drawn to the philosophies of mindfulness and minimalism, this is a moving and reflective book to read during a break from your everyday life. As an unashamed lover and reader of children\u2019s literature, I adored both Katherine Rundell\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/20/adults-should-read-childrens-books-says-oxford-don-and-author\" title=\"\">Why You Should Read Children\u2019s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/20/adults-should-read-childrens-books-says-oxford-don-and-author\" title=\"\"> </a>(Bloomsbury) and Lucy Mangan\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/mar/10/bookworm-memoir-childhood-reading-lucy-mangan-review\" title=\"\">Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading</a></em> (Vintage). As Rundell said: \u201cIgnore those who would call it mindless escapism: it\u2019s not escapism; it is findism. Children\u2019s books are not a hiding place, they are a seeking place.\u201d The slower pace of a holiday is the ideal time to remind yourself of the reason that you fell in love with books and reading in the first place. A book I recommend perennially is the 1926 modern classic <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wind-sand-and-stars.html\" title=\"\">Wind, Sand and Stars</a></em> by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (Penguin). If flying leaves you jaded, this beautifully lyrical and philosophical story of pioneering adventure will reawaken your sense of wonder at the miracle of flight.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62007e1cbb7d905c5983dfebbcedd8095d385dff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62007e1cbb7d905c5983dfebbcedd8095d385dff/0_0_1500_2202/681.jpg\" alt=\"Horizon by Barry Lopez.\" width=\"681\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Horizon by Barry Lopez.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>John Newman, bookseller</strong><br>Recent holidays have involved long-haul flights, and a book I can lose myself in is a necessity to get through the process. It has been a long but worthwhile 12-year wait for Markus Zusak\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/11/bridge-of-clay-markus-zusak-review\" title=\"\">Bridge of Clay</a></em> (Black Swan), a family saga of loss and redemption, which moves from eastern Europe to Australia and reads like a dream. A new novel from Michael Ondaatje is a thing I cherish and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/05/warlight-michael-ondaatje-review\" title=\"\">Warlight</a></em> (Vintage) is a gripping account of two children abandoned by parents and cared for by an array of shady characters in second world war London. Barbara Kingsolver never disappoints and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/24/unsheltered-by-barbara-kingsolver-review\" title=\"\">Unsheltered</a></em> (Faber &amp; Faber) looks back into an American past in a contemporary story of a family\u2019s attempts to maintain their dilapidated house. Two big and important books top my current reading pile: Barry Lopez\u2019s stunning autobiographical travelogue <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/14/horizon-by-barry-lopez-review\" title=\"\">Horizon</a></em> (Bodley Head) will go into my travel bag along with Robert Macfarlane\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/underland-by-robert-macfarlane-review\" title=\"\">Underland</a></em> (Hamish Hamilton).</p> <p><strong>Karima Turay-Davis, bookseller</strong><br>In Chibundu Onuzo\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/welcome-to-lagos-513041.html\" title=\"\">Welcome </a></em><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/welcome-to-lagos-513041.html\" title=\"\">to Lagos</a></em> (Faber &amp; Faber), at times funny and at times utterly tragic, five very different people represent the multifaceted nature of modern Nigeria. If you want a book that has you gasping to the very end, then Steve Cavanagh\u2019s<a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/thirteen-607560.html\" title=\"\"> </a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/thirteen-607560.html\" title=\"\">Thirteen</a></em> (Orion), in which a serial killer is on the jury of the person accused of his crimes, is the one for you. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/beyond-reasonable-doubt-9781526606129.html\" title=\"\">Beyond Reasonable Doubt</a></em> by Gary Bell (Raven) is another thriller I found hard to put down \u2013 a seemingly respected barrister who has it all is, in fact, an utter fraud. After years of getting away with his elaborate lie, the past comes back to haunt him. I can\u2019t resist suggesting <em>Sredni Vashtar</em> by Saki (Dover) \u2013 a cautionary story we should all pay heed to. I love Saki: very funny and always a sting in the tale.</p> <h2><strong>Book.ish, Chrickhowell, Wales</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"36ef55e6eb8ee683b924f3fec73c65b9d1054539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ef55e6eb8ee683b924f3fec73c65b9d1054539/0_62_4000_2770/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Corfield Walters, in her shop, Book-ish,  Crickhowell High Street, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Corfield-Walters, in her shop, Book-ish in Crickhowell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Nguyen/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Nine years ago Emma Corfield-Walters was running a building surveying company</em><em> before an \u201cearly mid-life crisis\u201d prompted her to sell up and start a bookshop. </em><em>She doesn\u2019t have time for a holiday this year: \u201cThere\u2019s no rest for the bookseller,\u201d she says, \u201cbut reading is a holiday in itself.

Victoria Hislop\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/those-who-are-loved-9781472223241.html\" title=\"\">Those Who Are Loved</a> </em>ticks all the boxes of brilliantly researched historical fiction bound up in family sagas set in her beloved Greece. Other historical drama can be found in Naomi Wood\u2019s third novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/hiding-game-9781509892785.html\" title=\"\">The Hiding Game</a></em>, a story of love and obsession set in the Bauhaus in turbulent 1920s Germany. Lastly, just as no bag was complete last year without <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/gentleman-in-moscow-529673.html\" title=\"\">A Gentleman in Moscow</a></em>, this year that bag must include Tayari Jones\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/02/an-american-marriage-tayari-jones-review\" title=\"\">An American Marriage</a></em>, a masterly telling of wrongful conviction and simmering racial tensions in the deep south. On the nonfiction front I recommend Mike Parker\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/12/on-the-red-hill-michael-parker-review\" title=\"\">On the Red Hill</a>, </em>part memoir, part meditation on nature and whole of heart. Finally, no one is better at slowing down our thoughts and encouraging us to really <em>look</em> than Robert Macfarlane, and his new masterpiece, <em>Underland</em>, is the perfect antidote to our hectic modern lives.</p> <h2><strong>Five Leaves, Nottingham</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5af191cb7501e7e3510a8656b0831c5fef82a489\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5af191cb7501e7e3510a8656b0831c5fef82a489/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"five leaves bookshop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Five Leaves is a radical bookshop committed to small presses where the diverse stock includes one of the biggest poetry sections outside London.

I\u2019m happy that Macfarlane does these things so that we don\u2019t have to. Especially the chapter where he gets stuck \u2013 literally \u2013 in one of the \u201cinvisible cities\u201d under Paris. Anyone who has seen the recent film <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/apr/17/red-joan-review-judi-dench\" title=\"\">Red Joan</a></em> might want the real story behind the spy Melita Norwood. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/melita-norwood\" title=\"\">David Burke\u2019s </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/mar/07/melita-norwood\" title=\"\">The Spy Who Came in From the Co-op</a></em> (Boydell &amp; Brewer) proves that truth can be more interesting than fiction, Melita being but one of a big network of committed Soviet agents desperate to secure \u201cthe bomb\u201d. There were times in the book I wished I\u2019d paid attention in physics class at school, but the remarkable thing is that the spies all wanted nuclear parity with the US to keep the peace by ensuring both sides in what became the cold war would have the capacity for mutually assured destruction.</p> <p><strong>Jane Anger, bookseller</strong><br>Having been a fan of Melissa Harrison\u2019s novels since her first, <em>Clay</em>, came out, I\u2019m recommending her new book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/06/all-among-the-barley-melissa-harrison-review\" title=\"\">All Among the Barley</a></em> (Bloomsbury). Set in 1930s rural England, it is a warning of how easy the slide to nationalism and fascism can be. Tishani Doshi\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/22/small-days-and-nights-by-tishani-doshi-review\" title=\"\">Small Days and </a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/22/small-days-and-nights-by-tishani-doshi-review\" title=\"\">Nights</a></em> (Bloomsbury Circus) is the first book of hers, fiction or poetry, that I\u2019ve read. I\u2019ll be looking for more. Like Harrison, Doshi hinges her story on the everyday decisions people have to make within the context of much larger issues of nation, family, politics and generation when the narrator moves from America back to modern India. I like to take poetry on holiday. <em>Take Three: Soundswrite Press New Poets Vol 1</em> features the work of three complementary poets. They read at Five Leaves earlier this year and I was bowled over by them all: Tuesday Shannon, Elizabeth Hourston and Pippa Hennessy (who is one of the team at Five Leaves, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m recommending it \u2013 honest).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ffde0e63cebaa9c1dd34141a4584de2e213754b4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffde0e63cebaa9c1dd34141a4584de2e213754b4/481_0_1597_2560/624.jpg\" alt=\"All Among the Barley by Melissa Harrison.\" width=\"624\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All Among the Barley by Melissa Harrison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Company Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Carl Davis, bookseller</strong><br><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wizard-and-the-prophet.html\" title=\"\">The Wizard and the Prophet</a></em> by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jun/10/charles-mann-book-wizard-prophet-interview\" title=\"\">Charles C Mann</a> (Picador) is the story of two men at odds over how Earth can hold the expected 10 billion inhabitants. William Vogt, the prophet, forefather of the green movement and author of <em>Road To Survival</em> in 1948, saw early on that our consumer culture was bringing about our downfall, and called for fundamental reversal. Norman Borlaug, the wizard, whose work on high-yield crops saved millions from starvation, believed science was the answer. It reads like the best thriller novel, taking in biography, environmentalism and social science, and is big history done on a grand scale to equal anything by Yuval Noah Harari or Jared Diamond. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/walt-whitman-speaks-9781598536140.html\" title=\"\">Walt Whitman Speaks</a></em>, edited by Brenda Wineapple (Library of America), collects the final thoughts of America\u2019s greatest poet as told to Horace Traubel somewhere between 1888 and Whitman\u2019s death in 1892. Whittled down from about 5,000 original pages, it is a treasure of Walt unvarnished, reflective and still firing on all cylinders into his 70s. From single sentences to long paragraphs, it is endlessly quotable and perfect for dipping into and savouring through warm summer evenings.</p> <p>Last year, Penguin published Wendell Berry\u2019s brilliant poems, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/20/the-peace-of-wild-things-wendell-barnes-rich-harvest\" title=\"\">The Peace of Wild Things</a></em>, and essays, , so I\u2019m very much looking forward to a collection of his short stories about Kentucky farming communities in <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/stand-by-me-9780241388617.html\" title=\"\">Stand By Me</a></em> (Allen Lane).

I first read it years ago and its simple, yet direct, visionary message has never left me. In our troubled times, with the climate emergency upon us, his fictional story of one man\u2019s practical and patient remedy for our collective illness has become increasingly prescient and required reading for all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8a0e2981abbcdca128d79297f82e1b3a4313081c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8a0e2981abbcdca128d79297f82e1b3a4313081c/0_0_306_500/306.jpg\" alt=\"On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong.\" width=\"306\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Leah Wilkins, bookseller</strong><br>This is probably a slightly unusual choice, but I recently discovered (by way of a gift from my future mother-in-law) Dorothy Whipple, who is currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance in Nottingham. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/someone-at-a-distance-9780953478026.html\" title=\"\">Someone at a Distance</a></em> (Persephone) is about the disastrous ramifications of an affair between a married man and his younger French lover. I finished it in 24 hours. Along with everybody else in the poetry world, I am currently enthralled by Raymond Antrobus\u2019s <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/perseverance.html\" title=\"\">The Perseverance</a></em>, a beautiful collection preoccupied by his relationship with his father, deafness and absence, mishearings and misunderstandings \u2013 it is a compellingly beautiful set of poems. Working in a bookshop means we\u2019re lucky enough to get hold of books early, so having managed to procure a proof copy of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/14/on-earth-we-are-briefly-gorgeous-ocean-vuong-review\" title=\"\">On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous</a> </em>by Ocean Vuong (Penguin), I added it to my ever growing to-read pile and promptly forgot about it. But if the reviews are anything to go by, it will be the first thing I pack in my holiday bag. As the parent of an 11-year-old daughter, it feels as necessary as ever to ensure that she is aware of the struggles women face. <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/girls-resist.html\" title=\"\">Girls Resist!</a></em> by KaeLyn Rich (Quirk) is a book that aims to help girls \u201cto use their voices to slash through injustice\u201d.

      "bodyText": "Golden Hare Books, Edinburgh Independent bookshop of the year 2019. When art historian Mark Jones opened his bookshop in 2012 he planned to call it \u2018The Golden Crocodile\u2019. He commissioned his daughter Agnes, an artist-blacksmith, to create a mascot for it and she returned with a golden hare. Julie Danskin, manager When shoppers ask me for holiday reads, they often want something engrossing for a plane journey. I highly recommend the immersive Vivian by Christina Hesselholdt (Fitzcarraldo), about the life of photographer Vivian Maier, or merman romantic comedy The Pisces by Melissa Broder (Bloomsbury). For those who prefer nonfiction, The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace-Wells (Allen Lane) is an unflinching look into our climate catastrophe. When you\u2019re by the pool or relaxing on a terrace, I recommend short stories and essays, especially Nicole Flattery\u2019s Show Them a Good Time (Bloomsbury) or Emilie Pine\u2019s vivid Notes to Self (Penguin). Anthologies make such great holiday reads, as you can discover new authors to seek out on your return to reality: see especially Being Various: New Irish Short Stories, edited by Lucy Caldwell (Faber &amp; Faber); The Penguin Book of the Contemporary British Short Story , edited by Philip Hensher; and either volume of The Bi-ble, edited by Lauren Nickodemus and Ellen Desmond (Monstrous Regiment) \u2013 essays about bisexuality. If, however, you prefer a doorstop novel, I absolutely loved The Parisian by Isabella Hammad (Jonathan Cape), a sprawling, Middlemarch-ian historical epic of love and resistance between France and Palestine. David Bloomfield, bookseller Getting away from it all doesn\u2019t mean avoiding socially conscious books, especially when they\u2019re addictive page-turners like Booker prize-nominated Washington Black by Esi Edugyan (Serpent\u2019s Tail): imagine Jules Verne\u2019s globetrotting style, but told from the perspective of a black slave, chronicling his story from backbreaking field labour to airship adventurer. For those with a taste for the curiously curated, Edward Carey\u2019s Little (Aardvark Bureau) charts the rise of the small girl who would become the famed Madame Tussaud. Initially penniless, she is taken under the wing of a cripplingly shy doctor who teaches her how to make perfect wax heads for the guillotine-wielding leaders of the French Revolution. It\u2019s a constantly intriguing historical fiction curio, especially with Carey\u2019s hand-drawn illustrations gracing many of the pages. Brilliant, readable nonfiction is out there too: White Fragility by Robin DiAngelo (Penguin) examines how white people attempt to prevent anti-racism measures, knowingly and unknowingly, and suggests how to challenge such behaviour in ourselves and others. Written in a no-nonsense, concise fashion, this is a must-read if you want to be an ally rather than an enemy. And for those who want to be in the know, Fabulosa! The Story of Polari, Britain\u2019s Secret Gay Language by Paul Baker (Reaktion) is a compelling history of the linguistic lengths to which gay people had to go to hide in plain sight within an aggressively homophobic culture. Newham Books, London Founded by a group of parents 41 years ago as a community bookshop, Newham continues to promote reading between parents and children. Manager Vivian Archer, a former actor, has worked at the shop for 31 years and last year won Outstanding Contribution to Bookselling at the Books Are My Bag Readers awards, while the shop is London\u2019s best independent bookshop, 2019. Vivian Archer, manager Three books recently published by great female writers should be on everyone\u2019s holiday list. In Girl, Woman, Other (Hamish Hamilton), Bernardine Evaristo weaves together the stories of a range of women across continents. It\u2019s a magnificent read from a writer with a gift for humanity. 10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World by Elif Shafak (Viking) is a brave, moving book, which captures the diversity of modern Turkey from one of its great writers. The Silence of the Girls (Penguin) is Pat Barker\u2019s brilliant retelling of Homer\u2019s Iliad through the eyes of Briseis, where women have the voice \u2013 unputdownable. Poetry books are ideal to pack. My current favourites are: The Perseverance by Raymond Antrobus (Penned in the Margins) \u2013 amazing work from the award-winning, deaf, spoken-word poet; and Fierce Fairytales by Nikita Gill (Orion), feminist fairy stories retold through verse. Gill Walker, bookseller My favourite book this year so far is The Salt Path by Raynor Winn (Penguin), an inspirational and lyrically observed memoir on the regenerative power of walking in nature, as well as a reminder that material things are much less important than we sometimes think. If you love the landscape of the British coastline and are drawn to the philosophies of mindfulness and minimalism, this is a moving and reflective book to read during a break from your everyday life. As an unashamed lover and reader of children\u2019s literature, I adored both Katherine Rundell\u2019s Why You Should Read Children\u2019s Books, Even Though You Are So Old and Wise (Bloomsbury) and Lucy Mangan\u2019s Bookworm: A Memoir of Childhood Reading (Vintage). As Rundell said: \u201cIgnore those who would call it mindless escapism: it\u2019s not escapism; it is findism. Children\u2019s books are not a hiding place, they are a seeking place.\u201d The slower pace of a holiday is the ideal time to remind yourself of the reason that you fell in love with books and reading in the first place. A book I recommend perennially is the 1926 modern classic Wind, Sand and Stars by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry (Penguin). If flying leaves you jaded, this beautifully lyrical and philosophical story of pioneering adventure will reawaken your sense of wonder at the miracle of flight. John Newman, bookseller Recent holidays have involved long-haul flights, and a book I can lose myself in is a necessity to get through the process. It has been a long but worthwhile 12-year wait for Markus Zusak\u2019s Bridge of Clay (Black Swan), a family saga of loss and redemption, which moves from eastern Europe to Australia and reads like a dream. A new novel from Michael Ondaatje is a thing I cherish and Warlight (Vintage) is a gripping account of two children abandoned by parents and cared for by an array of shady characters in second world war London. Barbara Kingsolver never disappoints and Unsheltered (Faber &amp; Faber) looks back into an American past in a contemporary story of a family\u2019s attempts to maintain their dilapidated house. Two big and important books top my current reading pile: Barry Lopez\u2019s stunning autobiographical travelogue Horizon (Bodley Head) will go into my travel bag along with Robert Macfarlane\u2019s Underland (Hamish Hamilton). Karima Turay-Davis, bookseller In Chibundu Onuzo\u2019s Welcome to Lagos (Faber &amp; Faber), at times funny and at times utterly tragic, five very different people represent the multifaceted nature of modern Nigeria. If you want a book that has you gasping to the very end, then Steve Cavanagh\u2019s Thirteen (Orion), in which a serial killer is on the jury of the person accused of his crimes, is the one for you. Beyond Reasonable Doubt by Gary Bell (Raven) is another thriller I found hard to put down \u2013 a seemingly respected barrister who has it all is, in fact, an utter fraud. After years of getting away with his elaborate lie, the past comes back to haunt him. I can\u2019t resist suggesting Sredni Vashtar by Saki (Dover) \u2013 a cautionary story we should all pay heed to. I love Saki: very funny and always a sting in the tale. Book.ish, Chrickhowell, Wales Nine years ago Emma Corfield-Walters was running a building surveying company before an \u201cearly mid-life crisis\u201d prompted her to sell up and start a bookshop. She doesn\u2019t have time for a holiday this year: \u201cThere\u2019s no rest for the bookseller,\u201d she says, \u201cbut reading is a holiday in itself. Books are my escape.\u201d She has just been picked as a \u201crising star\u201d by the Bookseller. Book.ish is regional independent bookshop of the year 2019 and sits on what is currently the \u201cUK\u2019s best high street\u201d \u2013 after Crickhowell won the top prize at last year\u2019s Great British High Street awards. Emma Corfield-Walters, owner You couldn\u2019t do better than take along a copy of Sweet Sorrow by David Nicholls, an astutely observed, nostalgic look at first love and that long summer on the cusp of adulthood. Victoria Hislop\u2019s Those Who Are Loved ticks all the boxes of brilliantly researched historical fiction bound up in family sagas set in her beloved Greece. Other historical drama can be found in Naomi Wood\u2019s third novel, The Hiding Game, a story of love and obsession set in the Bauhaus in turbulent 1920s Germany. Lastly, just as no bag was complete last year without A Gentleman in Moscow, this year that bag must include Tayari Jones\u2019s An American Marriage, a masterly telling of wrongful conviction and simmering racial tensions in the deep south. On the nonfiction front I recommend Mike Parker\u2019s On the Red Hill, part memoir, part meditation on nature and whole of heart. Finally, no one is better at slowing down our thoughts and encouraging us to really look than Robert Macfarlane, and his new masterpiece, Underland, is the perfect antidote to our hectic modern lives. Five Leaves, Nottingham Five Leaves is a radical bookshop committed to small presses where the diverse stock includes one of the biggest poetry sections outside London. Originally founded as a publishing press in 1996 by Ross Bradshaw, who took its name from a Nick Drake album, Five Leaves was independent bookshop of the year, 2018. Ross Bradshaw, founder and owner Underland by Robert Macfarlane (Hamish Hamilton) is subtitled A Deep Time Journey and it will take you on journeys that you might only want to share on the page, unless you are into extreme caving or enjoy rough camping in extreme weather. I\u2019m happy that Macfarlane does these things so that we don\u2019t have to. Especially the chapter where he gets stuck \u2013 literally \u2013 in one of the \u201cinvisible cities\u201d under Paris. Anyone who has seen the recent film Red Joan might want the real story behind the spy Melita Norwood. David Burke\u2019s The Spy Who Came in From the Co-op (Boydell &amp; Brewer) proves that truth can be more interesting than fiction, Melita being but one of a big network of committed Soviet agents desperate to secure \u201cthe bomb\u201d. There were times in the book I wished I\u2019d paid attention in physics class at school, but the remarkable thing is that the spies all wanted nuclear parity with the US to keep the peace by ensuring both sides in what became the cold war would have the capacity for mutually assured destruction. Jane Anger, bookseller Having been a fan of Melissa Harrison\u2019s novels since her first, Clay, came out, I\u2019m recommending her new book, All Among the Barley (Bloomsbury). Set in 1930s rural England, it is a warning of how easy the slide to nationalism and fascism can be. Tishani Doshi\u2019s Small Days and Nights (Bloomsbury Circus) is the first book of hers, fiction or poetry, that I\u2019ve read. I\u2019ll be looking for more. Like Harrison, Doshi hinges her story on the everyday decisions people have to make within the context of much larger issues of nation, family, politics and generation when the narrator moves from America back to modern India. I like to take poetry on holiday. Take Three: Soundswrite Press New Poets Vol 1 features the work of three complementary poets. They read at Five Leaves earlier this year and I was bowled over by them all: Tuesday Shannon, Elizabeth Hourston and Pippa Hennessy (who is one of the team at Five Leaves, but that\u2019s not why I\u2019m recommending it \u2013 honest). Carl Davis, bookseller The Wizard and the Prophet by Charles C Mann (Picador) is the story of two men at odds over how Earth can hold the expected 10 billion inhabitants. William Vogt, the prophet, forefather of the green movement and author of Road To Survival in 1948, saw early on that our consumer culture was bringing about our downfall, and called for fundamental reversal. Norman Borlaug, the wizard, whose work on high-yield crops saved millions from starvation, believed science was the answer. It reads like the best thriller novel, taking in biography, environmentalism and social science, and is big history done on a grand scale to equal anything by Yuval Noah Harari or Jared Diamond. Walt Whitman Speaks, edited by Brenda Wineapple (Library of America), collects the final thoughts of America\u2019s greatest poet as told to Horace Traubel somewhere between 1888 and Whitman\u2019s death in 1892. Whittled down from about 5,000 original pages, it is a treasure of Walt unvarnished, reflective and still firing on all cylinders into his 70s. From single sentences to long paragraphs, it is endlessly quotable and perfect for dipping into and savouring through warm summer evenings. Last year, Penguin published Wendell Berry\u2019s brilliant poems, The Peace of Wild Things, and essays, , so I\u2019m very much looking forward to a collection of his short stories about Kentucky farming communities in Stand By Me (Allen Lane). I\u2019ll find time this summer, after way too long, to reread Jean Giorno\u2019s The Man Who Planted Trees (Peter Owen). I first read it years ago and its simple, yet direct, visionary message has never left me. In our troubled times, with the climate emergency upon us, his fictional story of one man\u2019s practical and patient remedy for our collective illness has become increasingly prescient and required reading for all. Leah Wilkins, bookseller This is probably a slightly unusual choice, but I recently discovered (by way of a gift from my future mother-in-law) Dorothy Whipple, who is currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance in Nottingham. Someone at a Distance (Persephone) is about the disastrous ramifications of an affair between a married man and his younger French lover. I finished it in 24 hours. Along with everybody else in the poetry world, I am currently enthralled by Raymond Antrobus\u2019s The Perseverance, a beautiful collection preoccupied by his relationship with his father, deafness and absence, mishearings and misunderstandings \u2013 it is a compellingly beautiful set of poems. Working in a bookshop means we\u2019re lucky enough to get hold of books early, so having managed to procure a proof copy of On Earth We\u2019re Briefly Gorgeous by Ocean Vuong (Penguin), I added it to my ever growing to-read pile and promptly forgot about it. But if the reviews are anything to go by, it will be the first thing I pack in my holiday bag. As the parent of an 11-year-old daughter, it feels as necessary as ever to ensure that she is aware of the struggles women face. Girls Resist! by KaeLyn Rich (Quirk) is a book that aims to help girls \u201cto use their voices to slash through injustice\u201d. She is already in talks with her headteacher about organising a bake sale to tackle inequality, so it\u2019s having the desired effect.",

And it is my experience of the importance of the festival that has made me choose it as the best place to start my move into writing and performing.\u201d</p> <p>Several national newspapers have shed staff critics in the last few years. Comedy and theatre critic Veronica Lee has watched the shrinking band of professional critics who can afford to attend Edinburgh with regret.</p> <p>\u201cAny cutback on covering the best arts festival in the world is a real shame,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere is no shortage of opinion out there, of course.

As a producer, I know if someone can still make you laugh when you have a hangover and it is the sixth show of the day, then they must be good.\u201d Mant said there is now greater coverage of music festivals than of arts festivals, so less work for specialist arts critics. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially as comedy is so popular and Edinburgh is now largely associated with comedy, though there is still brilliant theatre as well.\u201d Mant, whose show is called Polite Club, points out that many of the stars she has worked with in television got their start in Edinburgh. \u201cIt is Edinburgh that often does it for them, even if they have been working hard on the circuit,\u201d Mant said. \u201cSomeone like Roisin Conaty, who I worked with on Channel 4\u2019s GameFace, made a huge splash there first. And it is my experience of the importance of the festival that has made me choose it as the best place to start my move into writing and performing.\u201d Several national newspapers have shed staff critics in the last few years. Comedy and theatre critic Veronica Lee has watched the shrinking band of professional critics who can afford to attend Edinburgh with regret. \u201cAny cutback on covering the best arts festival in the world is a real shame,\u201d Lee said. \u201cThere is no shortage of opinion out there, of course. Lots of people post online or review for free, but for two decades now the number of top-level critics has been falling. It seems people are forgetting how important this festival is: it makes around \u00a390m for the city and feeds the beast of television. \u201cWhere would comedy shows be without Edinburgh to develop their new talents each year?\u201d Big breaks The newcomers critics found on the fringe: Aisling Bea (2012) Winner of the So You Think You\u2019re Funny award, she was nominated the following year as best newcomer. \u201cYou won\u2019t see many more assured newcomer sets than this,\u201d the Guardian said. Reginald D Hunter (2002) The festival favourite was spotted for the laid-back storytelling that later took him on to Never Mind The Buzzcocks, QI and Have I Got News For You. The Mighty Boosh (1998) Surreal sketch humour from Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding, with Rich Fulcher, saw them soon established as a comedy brand still fondly remembered by fans around the world. Barratt now acts and Fielding is one of the hosts of The Great British Bake Off on Channel 4.Harry Hill (1992) Winner of the first newcomer award, Hill was soon given his own show on Channel 4. He later hit the mainstream with Harry Hill\u2019s TV Burp on ITV.",

      "bodyText": "The New South Wales premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has dodged questions on whether \u201cover-policing\u201d at music festivals might be responsible for young people swallowing multiple pills, saying the strongest message to ensure lives aren\u2019t lost is \u201cdon\u2019t take illegal substances\u201d. A coronial inquest is currently scrutinising the drug-related deaths of six people at music festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. On Sunday, the premier said she was looking forward to receiving the recommendations that come from that inquiry and the ongoing special NSW inquiry into the drug ice. However, Berejiklian stopped short of promising the government would put in place the coroner\u2019s future recommendations before the upcoming summer music festival. \u201cIt depends on what the recommendations have been and I don\u2019t think anyone can accuse the state government of not taking a strict approach to music festivals,\u201d she told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe want to get the balance right, we want people to enjoy themselves, we want those festivals to continue and increase in number but we also need to ensure lives are not lost when that could be prevented. \u201cAnd the strongest message to anybody is don\u2019t take illegal substances, they\u2019re illegal for a reason.\u201d When asked whether there was a link between \u201cover-policing\u201d and young people swallowing multiple pills at festivals, Berejiklian said the government was taking a \u201cholistic approach\u201d to the issue that included not only a police response but the health and education sectors as well. \u201cAgain, we just extend our sympathies to families who lost loved ones recently at these music festivals and we\u2019ve seen in recent times how the inquest is bringing up those tragedies for them and our hearts go out to them,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see that happen again, I don\u2019t want to see families go through that enormous pain and ongoing pain.\u201d Last Monday the inquest heard that Alex Ross-King, 19, who died from a drug overdose at the Fomo music festival in Parramatta in January, took an unusually high amount of MDMA before arriving at the venue because she was afraid of being caught with the drugs by police. The NSW coroner\u2019s court heard Ross-King, from the NSW central coast, had consumed about three-quarters of an MDMA pill and was \u201cpre-loading\u201d on alcohol on a mini bus to the festival. When she arrived, counsel assisting the inquest Peggy Dwyer told the coroner she consumed another two pills \u201capparently to avoid the risk of detection by police of carrying them into the festival\u201d. \u201cShe told her friends that [it was] because she was nervous about being caught by the police that she took the drugs like that, apparently to avoid the risk of being caught,\u201d Dwyer told the inquest. Another witness at the inquest, who cannot be named because of a non-publication order, described a police officer telling her she would make a strip search at a music festival \u201cnice and slow\u201d if she did not tell her where she was hiding drugs. Simon Coffey, the director of the Defqon.1 music festival, suggested the heavy police presence at events was an \u201cintimidating experience\u201d for young people that may be contributing to fatalities.",

Quickly it was established that the producer, one Jotham Starr, had abused Isaac in his on-set trailer: there was proof (albeit without faces) in a shaky, tearful phone clip, and the four-part stage is thence set for the parents\u2019 dilemma: revenge and shame, or take the transformative \u00a33m, albeit with many strings attached?</p> <p>The BBC announced it as \u201cbrand new and highly relevant drama\u201d, but I had to wonder \u2013 highly relevant to <em>whom</em>, exactly? To all those tens of thousands of parents who have to struggle daily with a talented youngster taken advantage of by a Tinseltown sleazeball and then tugged between lottery-win payoffs and righteous vengeance/justice/closure \u2013 which must number at least\u2026 oh, let me see, <em>one</em> family, and that an entirely fictional one? Obviously, the drama came backended with the usual \u201cdetails of organisations offering information and support\u201d soft voices. Perish the thought that I should ever make light of the miseries of any abuse (while remembering that the savage majority of cases occur in the family) but I can\u2019t help thinking that nanny Auntie, with her breathless \u201chighly relevant\u201d, is perhaps just fanning the myths that stranger danger lurks under every rock.</p> <p>Right, that\u2019s my rant. To the drama. First up, good points: Max Fincham is quite a find as the seriously talented young actor having to cope not only with a fraught double life but also bloody adolescence, to which a thousand further guilty complexities have been added by Jotham\u2019s squalid entitlement. Rebecca Front is intriguingly woebegone as the compromised chaperone, veering between genuine horror when she learns the truth and chirpy corporate smiles at the family\u2019s new-found wealth: it\u2019s grand to see her with such a nuanced part. There are genuinely unsettling feelings of menace emanating from the phalanx of lawyers and their triplicate NDAs: you get the sense that they could not just ruin but break, smash that little family. But the normally splendid Babou Ceesay is vouchsafed way too much screen time to demonstrate how just <em>he</em>, father Manny, is <em>hurting</em>, torn, vengeful, conflicted, proud: his very many slow, hot tears are mainly, it seems too often, for himself. And by even the second episode we are hitting cram-it-all-in avenues about sibling rivalry, about race in Hollywood, about class and wealth, about equality in education, about teenage behaviour; it\u2019s all a little too much, when the original premise was fascinating enough. All grand intentions then, even if (I hope) few of us have to be reminded that child sexual abuse = bad. Yet as drama it adds up to a little less than the sum of its parts.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e30c5aeff37db569445ae6c6560c3147af7d0539\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e30c5aeff37db569445ae6c6560c3147af7d0539/0_124_4285_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy-Leigh Hickman and Sion Daniel Young in The Left Behind.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Eye-opener\u2019: Amy-Leigh Hickman and Sion Daniel Young in The Left Behind.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not an error made by <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07f4j35\" title=\"\">The Left Behind</a></strong>, a searing slice of Cardiff filming which took us to the dark heart of Islamophobia \u2013 not the kind pontificated over in the gentler salons and combed for definition and nuance, nor even the dodgy tweets, but the real kind of hate-crime that gets people burned alive in their halal shops.</p> <p>Astonishingly, it made one empathise hugely, if counterintuitively, with young Gethin, left behind in the jobs market \u2013 the gig economy was horribly illustrated, the pomp of his manager at the Chicken Hutch talking about \u201cfacilitating our customers\u2019 needs\u201d in stark contrast to his late-night texts (\u201cbruv \u2013 no need to cum in tmz. not enuf shifts 4 every1\u201d).

Sion Daniel Young played him with rare wit and made you heart-sorry for the once cheerful soul, now so wrongly mired in the blame game, to which Islam is so often \u2013 they hate women, right? And hate gays, right? \u2013 the easy no-brainer (in every sense) answer. Every politician worth any salt should have been across this and similar situations, hearing genuine post-crash grievances, not dismissing them this as thick or racist, at least five years ago: it might not have wholly halted the polarisation of society, but we might have had fair warning rather than the smug Westminster platitudes of \u201cour\u201d \u201cproud\u201d tolerance.

It\u2019s all the more gobsmacking in hindsight that even one stage was successful; how swiftly just one small process could have catastrophically unravelled the whole.</p> <p>Nasa headquarters featured typewriters. The \u201ccomputers\u201d were often human \u2013 often women, who did complex astrophysical maths, with pencils, on bits of paper. A little has been made of the alleged \u201cwitty banter\u201d of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, but I think that\u2019s pushing it a bit. In fact, like my pilots, I prefer my astronauts to be among the least amusing of raconteurs \u2013 the most stolid and boring individuals in or out of this world, in fact. Job done. I\u2019ll leave others to haver over what went \u201cwrong\u201d subsequently with space exploration and catch-up visits: I just revelled in a delighted fashion that, in the last century, enough human brainpower and \u2013 generally \u2013 goodwill came together at one point to create a truly extraordinary (still) achievement. Had I known, being dragged from jimjammed bed at 4am that Sunday night, I\u2019d be writing about it 50 years on, I would have taken better notes.</p> <p>I was a little unfair weeks ago to <strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m00059m9/gentleman-jack\" title=\"\">Gentleman Jack</a></strong>, dismissing the first couple of episodes I think as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/26/hatton-garden-summer-of-rockets-gentleman-jack-review\" title=\"\">Poldark with girl-kisses</a>\u201d or some such. It has proved so much richer than that tawdry pot-boiler: halfway through I feared I was falling a little in love with Suranne Jones\u2019s Anne Lister and her haughty hats and dev\u2019lish britches, and it is marvellous news, is it not, that she and writer Sally Wainwright have teamed up for a second series.</p> <p>Not that it didn\u2019t wobble a little: Ann Walker\u2019s vacillations, even in the huge context of the times \u2013 Halifax, 1830s, lesbianism \u2013 lent new definitions to the concept of \u201ctremulously mimsy\u201d, and I wonder whether the new season will be kept to six rather than eight episodes. But, oh, the verve Jones and (eventually, whew) Sophie Rundle brought, the sheer style and chutzpah and cast-confidence with which it has whipped and bestridden our screens over these last weeks! Hats must be joyfully doffed to all involved; and enough threads are still satisfyingly left unplucked for series two.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7d22dda83c5a9417f6ef4c12354d3ab715d701a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e7d22dda83c5a9417f6ef4c12354d3ab715d701a/0_112_4296_2578/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Rundle and Suranne Jones in the final episode of Gentleman Jack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Sheer style and chutzpah\u2019: Sophie Rundle and Suranne Jones in the final episode of Gentleman Jack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aimee Spinks/BBC/Lookout Point/HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

      "bodyText": "Dark Money (BBC One) | iPlayer The Left Behind (BBCThree/One) | iPlayer 8 Days: To the Moon and Back (BBC Two) | iPlayer Gentleman Jack (BBC One) | iPlayer So often we just pass by the continuity announcements with a lazy, half-open ear, but one this week simply bamboozled. Dark Money was the tale \u2013 nicely enough done, if up to a fairly low bar \u2013 of a superstar kid who had gone off with his chaperone to make a Hollywood blockbuster and returned to his working-class London life as if little had changed, digging out homework and school tie. Quickly it was established that the producer, one Jotham Starr, had abused Isaac in his on-set trailer: there was proof (albeit without faces) in a shaky, tearful phone clip, and the four-part stage is thence set for the parents\u2019 dilemma: revenge and shame, or take the transformative \u00a33m, albeit with many strings attached? The BBC announced it as \u201cbrand new and highly relevant drama\u201d, but I had to wonder \u2013 highly relevant to whom, exactly? To all those tens of thousands of parents who have to struggle daily with a talented youngster taken advantage of by a Tinseltown sleazeball and then tugged between lottery-win payoffs and righteous vengeance/justice/closure \u2013 which must number at least\u2026 oh, let me see, one family, and that an entirely fictional one? Obviously, the drama came backended with the usual \u201cdetails of organisations offering information and support\u201d soft voices. Perish the thought that I should ever make light of the miseries of any abuse (while remembering that the savage majority of cases occur in the family) but I can\u2019t help thinking that nanny Auntie, with her breathless \u201chighly relevant\u201d, is perhaps just fanning the myths that stranger danger lurks under every rock. Right, that\u2019s my rant. To the drama. First up, good points: Max Fincham is quite a find as the seriously talented young actor having to cope not only with a fraught double life but also bloody adolescence, to which a thousand further guilty complexities have been added by Jotham\u2019s squalid entitlement. Rebecca Front is intriguingly woebegone as the compromised chaperone, veering between genuine horror when she learns the truth and chirpy corporate smiles at the family\u2019s new-found wealth: it\u2019s grand to see her with such a nuanced part. There are genuinely unsettling feelings of menace emanating from the phalanx of lawyers and their triplicate NDAs: you get the sense that they could not just ruin but break, smash that little family. But the normally splendid Babou Ceesay is vouchsafed way too much screen time to demonstrate how just he, father Manny, is hurting, torn, vengeful, conflicted, proud: his very many slow, hot tears are mainly, it seems too often, for himself. And by even the second episode we are hitting cram-it-all-in avenues about sibling rivalry, about race in Hollywood, about class and wealth, about equality in education, about teenage behaviour; it\u2019s all a little too much, when the original premise was fascinating enough. All grand intentions then, even if (I hope) few of us have to be reminded that child sexual abuse = bad. Yet as drama it adds up to a little less than the sum of its parts. Not an error made by The Left Behind, a searing slice of Cardiff filming which took us to the dark heart of Islamophobia \u2013 not the kind pontificated over in the gentler salons and combed for definition and nuance, nor even the dodgy tweets, but the real kind of hate-crime that gets people burned alive in their halal shops. Astonishingly, it made one empathise hugely, if counterintuitively, with young Gethin, left behind in the jobs market \u2013 the gig economy was horribly illustrated, the pomp of his manager at the Chicken Hutch talking about \u201cfacilitating our customers\u2019 needs\u201d in stark contrast to his late-night texts (\u201cbruv \u2013 no need to cum in tmz. not enuf shifts 4 every1\u201d). And left behind in housing, finally sleeping rough; and left behind in love; and in dignity. Sion Daniel Young played him with rare wit and made you heart-sorry for the once cheerful soul, now so wrongly mired in the blame game, to which Islam is so often \u2013 they hate women, right? And hate gays, right? \u2013 the easy no-brainer (in every sense) answer. Every politician worth any salt should have been across this and similar situations, hearing genuine post-crash grievances, not dismissing them this as thick or racist, at least five years ago: it might not have wholly halted the polarisation of society, but we might have had fair warning rather than the smug Westminster platitudes of \u201cour\u201d \u201cproud\u201d tolerance. An eye-opener, and caustic, and harsh, and executed with some valour and exceptional talent. The corporation got in a little greedily early, arguably, with its 50th-anniversary stuff on the moon landings, but if every offering\u2019s as good as 8 Days: To the Moon and Back who am I to quibble? Beautifully synced between the newly cleaned tapes of conversations between Houston and the astronauts and a clutch of actors inside the equivalent of a small family saloon for a week, and featuring canny cuts between re-creation and historical footage, it underlined just what a fraught, impossibly ambitious thing the entire \u201969 venture was. It\u2019s all the more gobsmacking in hindsight that even one stage was successful; how swiftly just one small process could have catastrophically unravelled the whole. Nasa headquarters featured typewriters. The \u201ccomputers\u201d were often human \u2013 often women, who did complex astrophysical maths, with pencils, on bits of paper. A little has been made of the alleged \u201cwitty banter\u201d of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins, but I think that\u2019s pushing it a bit. In fact, like my pilots, I prefer my astronauts to be among the least amusing of raconteurs \u2013 the most stolid and boring individuals in or out of this world, in fact. Job done. I\u2019ll leave others to haver over what went \u201cwrong\u201d subsequently with space exploration and catch-up visits: I just revelled in a delighted fashion that, in the last century, enough human brainpower and \u2013 generally \u2013 goodwill came together at one point to create a truly extraordinary (still) achievement. Had I known, being dragged from jimjammed bed at 4am that Sunday night, I\u2019d be writing about it 50 years on, I would have taken better notes. I was a little unfair weeks ago to Gentleman Jack, dismissing the first couple of episodes I think as \u201cPoldark with girl-kisses\u201d or some such. It has proved so much richer than that tawdry pot-boiler: halfway through I feared I was falling a little in love with Suranne Jones\u2019s Anne Lister and her haughty hats and dev\u2019lish britches, and it is marvellous news, is it not, that she and writer Sally Wainwright have teamed up for a second series. Not that it didn\u2019t wobble a little: Ann Walker\u2019s vacillations, even in the huge context of the times \u2013 Halifax, 1830s, lesbianism \u2013 lent new definitions to the concept of \u201ctremulously mimsy\u201d, and I wonder whether the new season will be kept to six rather than eight episodes. But, oh, the verve Jones and (eventually, whew) Sophie Rundle brought, the sheer style and chutzpah and cast-confidence with which it has whipped and bestridden our screens over these last weeks! Hats must be joyfully doffed to all involved; and enough threads are still satisfyingly left unplucked for series two.",

I wonder about the presenting, I unpick the construction, I notice how music and other sounds are recorded, how they come in and out. I think about tone, and how we\u2019re led through a story. I don\u2019t do this all the time, by the way. It\u2019s a bit pointless over-analysing a political phone-in show, or a bro-ski podcast where everyone talks over each other. Also, I often let a show take me over and take me where it wants. Still, it\u2019s interesting; to properly listen, try and work a programme out.</p> <p>Understanding how audio is made is important for a reviewer. And I have some practical experience: I\u2019ve presented and interviewed for radio for over 20 years. But though I\u2019ve been in many rooms with producers, pointing at lines dancing across a screen, saying, \u201cI think that bit should go <em>there</em>, not <em>there</em>,\u201d I\u2019ve never made a programme myself.

She\u2019s based in a small town in Buckinghamshire, and runs her <a href=\"https://www.strangeandcharmed.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Strange &amp; Charmed</a> audio school there.

      "bodyText": "For this job, which I love, I spend a lot of time listening to audio: radio programmes, podcasts, soundscapes. I wonder about the presenting, I unpick the construction, I notice how music and other sounds are recorded, how they come in and out. I think about tone, and how we\u2019re led through a story. I don\u2019t do this all the time, by the way. It\u2019s a bit pointless over-analysing a political phone-in show, or a bro-ski podcast where everyone talks over each other. Also, I often let a show take me over and take me where it wants. Still, it\u2019s interesting; to properly listen, try and work a programme out. Understanding how audio is made is important for a reviewer. And I have some practical experience: I\u2019ve presented and interviewed for radio for over 20 years. But though I\u2019ve been in many rooms with producers, pointing at lines dancing across a screen, saying, \u201cI think that bit should go there, not there,\u201d I\u2019ve never made a programme myself. So I decided to learn. Which course to pick? Well, the best teachers are those whose work you admire, and, for me, Cathy FitzGerald is one of contemporary audio\u2019s best. She makes beautiful, award-winning audio documentaries, and is encouraging via email. She\u2019s based in a small town in Buckinghamshire, and runs her Strange &amp; Charmed audio school there.

      "body": "<p>On the second morning of our trek up Poon Hill, in a clearing in a rhododendron forest, my friend Ali and I stopped for a breather. Rarely has the word been more apt. I had to speak through my panting breaths. I thought of those messenger boys sent to deliver news of ancient battles. Cannae, perhaps, as in \u201cCannae go on.\u201d</p> <p>Our guide, Arjun, rested against a rock. I thought I saw him roll his eyes. Above us, the white crests of the Annapurna range glowed in clear autumn light. A golden eagle hung still in the air off the shoulder of the hill, surveying the dark green valleys that sloped off massively in every direction. Below us the thin forest gave way to junglier foliage and then, below, to terraced farms and villages and then to raging rivers. Water, I thought. That would be nice. After a while Ali spoke: \u201cWe are the fattest people on the mountain,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWhat about those German women at dinner?\u201d I replied. He shook his head sadly. I waited for my heart to calm down. Death itself by then would have come as sweet relief, but I had heard that stricken trekkers were taken off the mountain by donkey and I wanted to spare my family the headline: \u201cMule Never Walk Alone: British hiker makes ass of himself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"36ad041543714437f8d7f74b0e32a6014b8f9595\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/36ad041543714437f8d7f74b0e32a6014b8f9595/0_234_4288_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Take it easy: Poon Hill lies in the foothills of the Annapurnas in the Himilayas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Take it easy \u2026 Poon Hill lies in the foothills of the Annapurnas in the Himilayas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Meir Naamat Photog/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At times over the preceding couple of days it had certainly seemed possible to die of stairs. If you search online for the \u201ceasiest trek in Nepal\u201d, Poon Hill is the name that keeps cropping up. To believe the descriptions, this would be the gentlest of strolls, the kind of thing you might do with a Labrador to shake off a long lunch in the countryside. That was what we had in mind. Three days in the shadow of Annapurna, in the centre of Nepal. Enough to say we\u2019d done our Himalayan trek, but not long enough to worry about training.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"babf5f09d203c1986821891064a44baf5b03add7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/babf5f09d203c1986821891064a44baf5b03add7/0_0_6216_4416/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sunset at Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"710\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunset at Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marek Poplawski/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We warmed up with a few days\u2019 acclimatisation in Kathmandu. Our guide there was our friend Guy, who is living in the city while he finishes a PhD in Sanskrit. We did what any old university friends do in these situations: buy a bottle of cheap whisky and start abusing each other. At night we went down to the Pashupatinath Temple, which sprawls on both sides of the Bagmati river, a holy site for Buddhists and Hindus alike. The dead are still cremated here, and light from burning pyres cast the buildings alongside the water in flickering orange light. Wild dogs and monkeys watched from the shadows. The animals are sacred and have the run of the place. Slowly, groups of pallbearers emerged from back streets, holding white-shrouded bodies aloft.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"caa02378e83f3cfd25bce12191d7decbd922dbcf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/caa02378e83f3cfd25bce12191d7decbd922dbcf/0_512_3400_4398/773.jpg\" alt=\"An altar at Dwarika\u2019s Hotel.\" width=\"773\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An altar at Dwarika\u2019s Hotel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>An outdoorsy friend had put me in touch with Rajan Simkhada, the genial boss of <a href=\"https://enepaltrekking.com/about-us/mr-rajan-simkhada/\" title=\"\">Earthbound Expeditions</a>, one of approximately 153,000 tour companies in the city, and he had agreed to set the trip up. The next morning we met him for coffee in the grounds of <a href=\"https://www.dwarikas.com/\" title=\"\">Dwarika\u2019s Hotel</a>, perhaps the most famous residence in the city and certainly one of the most beautiful. Its red brick buildings are adorned with intricate wood carvings, some many hundreds of years old. Kathmandu\u2019s architectural heritage can\u2019t be taken for granted; much of it is still being rebuilt in the wake of the 2015 earthquake, which killed about 9,000 people. Rajan explained that it had also decimated tourist numbers, although they were rising again. </p> <p>Rajan didn\u2019t mention the stairs. He just looked us up and down and gave us a wry grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel you have done some exercise,\u201d he said. In total the Poon Hill circuit involves a climb of around 1,500 metres, or the Shard five times over, to put it in softie Londoner terms. Almost all the elevation is by steps, some 3,381 in total. The route is a loop around the southwestern edge of the larger Annapurna circuit, which in its entirety takes three weeks. The paths are well marked, with thousands of trekkers going around every year. Rajan even has a hotel, the <a href=\"http://www.thamelecoresort.com/\" title=\"\">Thamel Eco Lodge</a>, where you can stay before or after the trek. All we had to decide was how to get to Pokhara, the lakeside city west of Nepal from which many treks start. The bus was seven hours, the plane half an hour.</p> <p>When we landed at Pokhara the next day, Arjun was there to meet us along with his cousin, Kedar, who would be our porter. Arjun said this would be his 75th trip round Poon Hill and he was anxious to get cracking. In contrast to the pricey walking shoes I\u2019d bought in Covent Garden, both of them wore trainers. Their footwear proved little impediment to them as they led the way up from Nayapul, the village where we spent the first night. Accommodation on the trail is in \u201ctea houses\u201d \u2013 lodges with varying degrees of facilities. Some have hot showers, most have wifi, all have beer \u2013 an accurate reflection of the modern pyramid of human needs. Day two was at Ghorepani, before our dawn ascent of Poon Hill itself and a final night in Ghandruk.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac2afeb83c7aa922a7495b41a44de46ebedb25f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac2afeb83c7aa922a7495b41a44de46ebedb25f1/0_121_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mountain high: Ghandruk village.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mountain high \u2026 Ghandruk village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nepal Photos/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like parents, good guides know to overestimate times and distances. Arjun\u2019s skill was that he adjusted this even as we thought we had sussed him out. On the first day he would say an hour and mean 45 minutes. On day three he\u2019d say an hour and we would think \u201cAha\u201d, 45 minutes, but it would only be half an hour. It\u2019s impossible to overstate the boost to morale of a surprisingly quick finish. In the evenings he would tell us about Nepal\u2019s history while we ate yet another meal of dal bhat, the ubiquitous plate of curry, rice, dal and pickles which our guides happily wolfed down three times a day. Arjun was proud of his nation, famous mainly for hard men (Ghurkhas and Sherpas) and steep mountains \u2013 even though its potholed roads are not helping its drive to become a more modernised and diverse 21st century economy.</p> <p>For all the agony of the climb, by the time we were on the way down the Himalayas had worked their magic. What got me wasn\u2019t the eagles or the butterflies or the cheerful locals saying their endless <em>namastes</em> as you passed, or the terrain that went from exposed snow-capped peak to rainforest canyon to mountain meadow. It was the sheer size of the landscape. The mountain grows under you until it occupies your whole mind. As we neared the end we were overtaken, with a slight tut, by an old woman on crutches, one ankle set in a cast. She had seen it all before.</p> <p><em>\u2022 A three-night tour of the Poon Hill with <a href=\"https://enepaltrekking.com/destination/nepal/\">Earthbound Expeditions</a> circuit starts from $300 (\u00a3238), not including plane transfers.

Three days in the shadow of Annapurna, in the centre of Nepal. Enough to say we\u2019d done our Himalayan trek, but not long enough to worry about training. We warmed up with a few days\u2019 acclimatisation in Kathmandu. Our guide there was our friend Guy, who is living in the city while he finishes a PhD in Sanskrit. We did what any old university friends do in these situations: buy a bottle of cheap whisky and start abusing each other. At night we went down to the Pashupatinath Temple, which sprawls on both sides of the Bagmati river, a holy site for Buddhists and Hindus alike. The dead are still cremated here, and light from burning pyres cast the buildings alongside the water in flickering orange light. Wild dogs and monkeys watched from the shadows. The animals are sacred and have the run of the place. Slowly, groups of pallbearers emerged from back streets, holding white-shrouded bodies aloft. An outdoorsy friend had put me in touch with Rajan Simkhada, the genial boss of Earthbound Expeditions, one of approximately 153,000 tour companies in the city, and he had agreed to set the trip up. The next morning we met him for coffee in the grounds of Dwarika\u2019s Hotel, perhaps the most famous residence in the city and certainly one of the most beautiful. Its red brick buildings are adorned with intricate wood carvings, some many hundreds of years old. Kathmandu\u2019s architectural heritage can\u2019t be taken for granted; much of it is still being rebuilt in the wake of the 2015 earthquake, which killed about 9,000 people. Rajan explained that it had also decimated tourist numbers, although they were rising again. Rajan didn\u2019t mention the stairs. He just looked us up and down and gave us a wry grin. \u201cYou\u2019ll feel you have done some exercise,\u201d he said. In total the Poon Hill circuit involves a climb of around 1,500 metres, or the Shard five times over, to put it in softie Londoner terms. Almost all the elevation is by steps, some 3,381 in total. The route is a loop around the southwestern edge of the larger Annapurna circuit, which in its entirety takes three weeks. The paths are well marked, with thousands of trekkers going around every year. Rajan even has a hotel, the Thamel Eco Lodge, where you can stay before or after the trek. All we had to decide was how to get to Pokhara, the lakeside city west of Nepal from which many treks start. The bus was seven hours, the plane half an hour. When we landed at Pokhara the next day, Arjun was there to meet us along with his cousin, Kedar, who would be our porter. Arjun said this would be his 75th trip round Poon Hill and he was anxious to get cracking. In contrast to the pricey walking shoes I\u2019d bought in Covent Garden, both of them wore trainers. Their footwear proved little impediment to them as they led the way up from Nayapul, the village where we spent the first night. Accommodation on the trail is in \u201ctea houses\u201d \u2013 lodges with varying degrees of facilities. Some have hot showers, most have wifi, all have beer \u2013 an accurate reflection of the modern pyramid of human needs. Day two was at Ghorepani, before our dawn ascent of Poon Hill itself and a final night in Ghandruk. Like parents, good guides know to overestimate times and distances. Arjun\u2019s skill was that he adjusted this even as we thought we had sussed him out. On the first day he would say an hour and mean 45 minutes. On day three he\u2019d say an hour and we would think \u201cAha\u201d, 45 minutes, but it would only be half an hour. It\u2019s impossible to overstate the boost to morale of a surprisingly quick finish. In the evenings he would tell us about Nepal\u2019s history while we ate yet another meal of dal bhat, the ubiquitous plate of curry, rice, dal and pickles which our guides happily wolfed down three times a day. Arjun was proud of his nation, famous mainly for hard men (Ghurkhas and Sherpas) and steep mountains \u2013 even though its potholed roads are not helping its drive to become a more modernised and diverse 21st century economy. For all the agony of the climb, by the time we were on the way down the Himalayas had worked their magic. What got me wasn\u2019t the eagles or the butterflies or the cheerful locals saying their endless namastes as you passed, or the terrain that went from exposed snow-capped peak to rainforest canyon to mountain meadow. It was the sheer size of the landscape. The mountain grows under you until it occupies your whole mind. As we neared the end we were overtaken, with a slight tut, by an old woman on crutches, one ankle set in a cast. She had seen it all before. \u2022 A three-night tour of the Poon Hill with Earthbound Expeditions circuit starts from $300 (\u00a3238), not including plane transfers.

The other reports, one by Naomi Ellenbogen QC on harassment in the House of Lords, one on ditto in the Commons, by Gemma White QC, expose not just institutionalised sexism but a deep resistance \u2013 given Westminster\u2019s inaction following the 2018 recommendations from Dame Laura Cox \u2013 to tackling it. With Boris Johnson, and his enthusiasm for \u201csemi-naked women\u2026 glistening like wet otters\u201d, as the incoming figurehead, there is little reason for optimism.

That the Law Commission is, following campaigning by Stella Creasy, Women\u2019s Aid, the Fawcett Society and others, now consulting on whether misogyny should require an addition to the protected characteristics list, means that this curb on molestation, on the streets as well as in the legislature, might be achievable.

      "body": "<p>One swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer, so the old saying goes. For the warm middle months of the year, the British economy looked remarkably frosty, chilled by fears over a no-deal Brexit, until the Office for National Statistics reported a surprisingly strong month for growth in May.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/10/uk-economy-returns-to-growth-as-carmakers-end-brexit-shutdown-ons\" title=\"\">The figures, released last week,</a> were a glimmer of hope that Britain might yet shrug off the worst of the Brexit cold, which has laid the economy low over recent months as companies put their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/08/no-deal-threat-causes-sharpest-investment-drop-since-2009-recession\" title=\"\">investment plans on ice</a>.</p> <p>With the political chaos at Westminster \u2013 and as a carnival of promises are made by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in the Tory leadership race, many of which would surely never fly \u2013 businesses cannot be blamed for taking pause.</p> <p>But underneath the warm glow of the most recent GDP figures, which showed the economy expanded at a reasonable 0.3% in May from the previous month, there are reasons to be fearful of a damp summer for growth. Paralysed by uncertainty, Britain could still tilt into recession even before the proper damage has been done from leaving the EU at the end of October.</p> <p>The improvement on the month was driven by carmakers reviving production after stoppages in April, which had been planned to avoid any disruption in a no-deal scenario around the original Brexit deadline on 29 March.</p> <p>However, the ONS warned that car production had returned only to the subdued levels seen at the start of the year. The economy was hardly racing ahead, it suggested, as Brexit uncertainty held down growth.</p> <p>The monthly growth figures could prove a false indicator, masking a wider slowdown in the three months to June. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, one of the leading economic forecasters, still expects GDP to slide by 0.1% in the second quarter, putting the UK on the brink of recession. It bets on a return to growth in the third quarter, avoiding such a fate, but the risk is there.</p> <p>The latest readings for activity from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/03/brexit-uk-economy-may-be-shrinking-on-back-of-no-deal-fears\" title=\"\">IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply</a>, which are closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signs, indicate a near standstill in June. And <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/09/consumer-spending-at-weakest-since-mid-90s-amid-brexit-chaos-british-retail-consortium\" title=\"\">according to retailers</a>, annual consumer spending growth in June was the weakest since 1995.</p> <p>The world economy has also faltered in recent months, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/02/trade-wars-could-shipwreck-global-economy-warns-mark-carney\" title=\"\">US-China trade war rattles international trade</a>. The openness of the UK economy means it is especially vulnerable, at a time of maximum weakness due to Brexit. The odds of a recession are rising. And the consequences would be far-reaching.</p> <p>One scenario would see the economy crash further into the red, exacerbating the damage done in recent months. Tailbacks at ports could cause disruption across the country for manufacturers, serving as a brake on growth.</p> <p>Employment has so far held up reasonably well, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/11/uk-jobs-growth-slows-amid-brexit-uncertainty\" title=\"\">record numbers of people in work</a>. But this could change rapidly in a no-deal Brexit.</p> <p>Another scenario would have political consequences. Should the UK slide into recession in the middle of the year, the incoming prime minister could blame prevarication for the damage. Delaying Brexit has caused the damage, they might say; Brexit, \u201cdo or die\u201d, in the autumn is the only answer. Down such a road madness lies: ending the uncertainty with the thing businesses fear most would be the worst possible solution.</p> <p>It is highly unlikely no deal would have little impact on growth. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, warned on Thursday it would deliver a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/11/bank-of-england-warns-of-lending-crisis-for-eu-firms-after-no-deal-brexit\" title=\"\">major economic shock</a>\u201d. But what if the impact wasn\u2019t as bad as feared? Johnson or Hunt could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/11/osbornomics-dead-ask-boris-johnson-jeremy-hunt\" title=\"\">turn on the Treasury spending taps</a>, boosting growth, and claim to have rescued the economy from a recession, while also leaving the EU. A \u201cBrexit bounce\u201d could make a snap election tempting soon thereafter.</p> <p>The British economy this summer stands in sharp contrast to 2018, when the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/10/uk-economy-gets-kick-from-world-cup-heatwave\" title=\"\">men\u2019s football World Cup and hot weather</a> brought consumers out in their droves to fuel a mini economic boom. Despite positive growth in May, this year is very different. A summer slump awaits.</p> <h2>Watchdog wakes up to plight of publicans tied to big brewers</h2> <p>Old habits are hard to break and the so-called beer tie is no exception. It dates back to the 18th century, when brewers, particularly in London, started <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/09/porter-beer-empire-of-drinks-henry-jeffreys\" title=\"\">churning out porter in huge volumes</a>. To ensure steady custom, they helped publicans set up shop by renting them premises. In exchange, the tenant agreed to stock their beer. Everybody was happy.</p> <p>That arrangement has endured, in one form or another, for the best part of 300 years. But in 2016, amid growing disillusionment about the power wielded by a handful of major pub companies (pubcos), the government introduced the pubs code.</p> <p>It contained the market rent only (MRO) option, a mechanism that theoretically allowed publicans to cut the tie. They would lose out on favourable lease terms but would be freed to buy beer more cheaply on the open market and choose what brews they served.</p> <p>The problem is that the MRO option is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/may/31/tied-up-pub-landlords-battle-law-that-was-meant-to-help-them\" title=\"\">little more than a myth</a>. Pubcos use deep pockets and sharp lawyers to run rings around their tenants and keep the tie intact. Many publicans simply lose heart and give up. Precious few MRO applications have been successful.</p> <p>The Pubs Code Adjudicator, which regulates disputes, has been accused of being supine in the face of an obvious power imbalance. Some say it is far too cosy with pubcos to challenge them.</p> <p>Now the regulator has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/10/heineken-pub-and-bar-business-investigated-by-pca-over-beer-tie\" title=\"\">launched what could be a landmark investigation</a> into Heineken-owned Star Pubs &amp; Bars.

      "bodyText": "One swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer, so the old saying goes. For the warm middle months of the year, the British economy looked remarkably frosty, chilled by fears over a no-deal Brexit, until the Office for National Statistics reported a surprisingly strong month for growth in May. The figures, released last week, were a glimmer of hope that Britain might yet shrug off the worst of the Brexit cold, which has laid the economy low over recent months as companies put their investment plans on ice. With the political chaos at Westminster \u2013 and as a carnival of promises are made by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt in the Tory leadership race, many of which would surely never fly \u2013 businesses cannot be blamed for taking pause. But underneath the warm glow of the most recent GDP figures, which showed the economy expanded at a reasonable 0.3% in May from the previous month, there are reasons to be fearful of a damp summer for growth. Paralysed by uncertainty, Britain could still tilt into recession even before the proper damage has been done from leaving the EU at the end of October. The improvement on the month was driven by carmakers reviving production after stoppages in April, which had been planned to avoid any disruption in a no-deal scenario around the original Brexit deadline on 29 March. However, the ONS warned that car production had returned only to the subdued levels seen at the start of the year. The economy was hardly racing ahead, it suggested, as Brexit uncertainty held down growth. The monthly growth figures could prove a false indicator, masking a wider slowdown in the three months to June. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, one of the leading economic forecasters, still expects GDP to slide by 0.1% in the second quarter, putting the UK on the brink of recession. It bets on a return to growth in the third quarter, avoiding such a fate, but the risk is there. The latest readings for activity from the IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, which are closely watched by the Treasury for early warning signs, indicate a near standstill in June. And according to retailers, annual consumer spending growth in June was the weakest since 1995. The world economy has also faltered in recent months, as the US-China trade war rattles international trade. The openness of the UK economy means it is especially vulnerable, at a time of maximum weakness due to Brexit. The odds of a recession are rising. And the consequences would be far-reaching. One scenario would see the economy crash further into the red, exacerbating the damage done in recent months. Tailbacks at ports could cause disruption across the country for manufacturers, serving as a brake on growth. Employment has so far held up reasonably well, with record numbers of people in work. But this could change rapidly in a no-deal Brexit. Another scenario would have political consequences. Should the UK slide into recession in the middle of the year, the incoming prime minister could blame prevarication for the damage. Delaying Brexit has caused the damage, they might say; Brexit, \u201cdo or die\u201d, in the autumn is the only answer. Down such a road madness lies: ending the uncertainty with the thing businesses fear most would be the worst possible solution. It is highly unlikely no deal would have little impact on growth. Mark Carney, the Bank of England governor, warned on Thursday it would deliver a \u201cmajor economic shock\u201d. But what if the impact wasn\u2019t as bad as feared? Johnson or Hunt could turn on the Treasury spending taps, boosting growth, and claim to have rescued the economy from a recession, while also leaving the EU. A \u201cBrexit bounce\u201d could make a snap election tempting soon thereafter. The British economy this summer stands in sharp contrast to 2018, when the men\u2019s football World Cup and hot weather brought consumers out in their droves to fuel a mini economic boom. Despite positive growth in May, this year is very different. A summer slump awaits. Watchdog wakes up to plight of publicans tied to big brewers Old habits are hard to break and the so-called beer tie is no exception. It dates back to the 18th century, when brewers, particularly in London, started churning out porter in huge volumes. To ensure steady custom, they helped publicans set up shop by renting them premises. In exchange, the tenant agreed to stock their beer. Everybody was happy. That arrangement has endured, in one form or another, for the best part of 300 years. But in 2016, amid growing disillusionment about the power wielded by a handful of major pub companies (pubcos), the government introduced the pubs code. It contained the market rent only (MRO) option, a mechanism that theoretically allowed publicans to cut the tie. They would lose out on favourable lease terms but would be freed to buy beer more cheaply on the open market and choose what brews they served. The problem is that the MRO option is little more than a myth. Pubcos use deep pockets and sharp lawyers to run rings around their tenants and keep the tie intact. Many publicans simply lose heart and give up. Precious few MRO applications have been successful. The Pubs Code Adjudicator, which regulates disputes, has been accused of being supine in the face of an obvious power imbalance. Some say it is far too cosy with pubcos to challenge them. Now the regulator has launched what could be a landmark investigation into Heineken-owned Star Pubs &amp; Bars. It suspects Star of seeking to impose unreasonable terms on publicans who apply to go free of tie. The deputy adjudicator, Fiona Dickie, hinted that other pubcos could face similar scrutiny. Publicans will feel it should not have taken this long for the watchdog to bare its teeth. But late is better than never. Half-baked reforms beget half-baked market response for Deutsche At the end of Deutsche Bank\u2019s most tumultuous week in decades, shares in this still-enormous financial firm closed on Friday lower than where they stood on Monday morning. In other words, chief executive Christian Sewing\u2019s \u201cradical\u201d plan to \u201ctransform\u201d the business was greeted with a sceptical shrug. Deutsche is still the lowest-rated major European bank. Unfortunately for Sewing, the market\u2019s reaction was logical. Deutsche\u2019s troubles were at least 10 years in the making and were ignored for another 10. Fixing the deep ailments could take another decade. The crisis was born in the birth-of-the-euro era when Deutsche tried to turn its investment bank into a European rival to Goldman Sachs, an adventure that enjoyed some success until the financial bubble burst in 2008. But Deutsche then failed to do what the Wall Street outfits did \u2013 cut costs ruthlessly and adapt to a world where regulators demand fatter capital cushions. Sewing is now obliged to hit the panic button by culling 18,000 staff. Better late than never? Well, yes, on its old course Deutsche was only a few missteps from becoming a political headache for Berlin. The new strategy, with a central ambition to service German businesses and retail customers, is definitely safer. Yet the investment bank is not disappearing. Only the share trading arm is being cut. The fixed-income division \u2013 meaning bonds and interest rates \u2013 will be shrunk but will still be large. Such a half-in, half-out strategy is unproven.

The UK currently only measures its production of carbon emissions.</p> <p>It comes after concerns over so-called \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d, which sees countries reduce their domestic production of carbon by importing products responsible for emissions. Overall, global emissions have increased since 1997, even though they have fallen among 38 developed nations that signed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/kyoto-protocol\" title=\"\">Kyoto protocol</a> to reduce their mean annual greenhouse gas emissions.</p> <p>According to government figures, the UK\u2019s consumption of emissions is 69% higher than the amount it produces. While its carbon production footprint has fallen by 40%, it has only fallen by 10% when consumption is measured. Some experts warn that it was only the financial crisis and economic downturn in 2007 that ended the increase in the UK\u2019s consumption of carbon emissions.</p> <p>Speaking at the party\u2019s international social forum on Sunday, Corbyn was due to say that the next Labour government will \u201cface up to the climate emergency by recognising our real carbon footprint\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We don\u2019t only contribute to climate breakdown with what we produce, we contribute with what we consume too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cCurrently, when we measure a country\u2019s emissions, we are talking about the greenhouse gasses generated as goods and services that are produced in that country,\u201d he was expected to say. \u201cBut for a country like Britain, that measurement hides the country\u2019s true impact on our climate because we don\u2019t only contribute to climate breakdown with what we produce, we contribute with what we consume too.</p> <p>\u201cOver the last two decades the UK has reduced emissions \u2013 but it has done so in part by offshoring those emissions. That isn\u2019t tackling global emissions \u2013 it is passing the buck to poorer countries.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time we were honest about our contribution to the climate crisis: it is even greater than we think. So under Labour, Britain will become the first major economy in the world to measure these consumption emissions and take action to reduce them. We shouldn\u2019t see this as a burden. Offshoring our emissions isn\u2019t just bad for the climate, it\u2019s bad for UK industry.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we will send financial and technical support to the developing world, helping them adopt greener methods of production and reducing the carbon content of the goods we import.\u201d</p> <p>The announcement comes with Labour under pressure from both the Lib Dems and the Greens in the polls. Both are preparing a series of measures on climate change, while the Greens performed strongly at the European elections.</p> <p>Labour would amend the Climate Change Act to instruct the Committee on Climate Change to include an assessment of our \u201ctotal footprint emissions\u201d in their annual report to parliament.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The UK will stop hiding its \u201ctrue impact\u201d on the climate by revealing its consumption of carbon emissions from across the world, Jeremy Corbyn was due to pledge on Sunday. In an attempt to place his party at the forefront of the battle against the climate crisis, the Labour leader was due to say, is \u201ceven greater than we think\u201d and demands an end to \u201cpassing the buck to poorer countries\u201d. Corbyn is due to announce that the next Labour government will \u201cshow true international leadership\u201d by making the country the first major economy to measure the emissions it imports, as well as those it produces. The UK currently only measures its production of carbon emissions. It comes after concerns over so-called \u201ccarbon leakage\u201d, which sees countries reduce their domestic production of carbon by importing products responsible for emissions. Overall, global emissions have increased since 1997, even though they have fallen among 38 developed nations that signed the Kyoto protocol to reduce their mean annual greenhouse gas emissions. According to government figures, the UK\u2019s consumption of emissions is 69% higher than the amount it produces. While its carbon production footprint has fallen by 40%, it has only fallen by 10% when consumption is measured. Some experts warn that it was only the financial crisis and economic downturn in 2007 that ended the increase in the UK\u2019s consumption of carbon emissions. Speaking at the party\u2019s international social forum on Sunday, Corbyn was due to say that the next Labour government will \u201cface up to the climate emergency by recognising our real carbon footprint\u201d. \u201cCurrently, when we measure a country\u2019s emissions, we are talking about the greenhouse gasses generated as goods and services that are produced in that country,\u201d he was expected to say. \u201cBut for a country like Britain, that measurement hides the country\u2019s true impact on our climate because we don\u2019t only contribute to climate breakdown with what we produce, we contribute with what we consume too. \u201cOver the last two decades the UK has reduced emissions \u2013 but it has done so in part by offshoring those emissions. That isn\u2019t tackling global emissions \u2013 it is passing the buck to poorer countries. \u201cIt\u2019s time we were honest about our contribution to the climate crisis: it is even greater than we think. So under Labour, Britain will become the first major economy in the world to measure these consumption emissions and take action to reduce them. We shouldn\u2019t see this as a burden. Offshoring our emissions isn\u2019t just bad for the climate, it\u2019s bad for UK industry. \u201cAnd we will send financial and technical support to the developing world, helping them adopt greener methods of production and reducing the carbon content of the goods we import.\u201d The announcement comes with Labour under pressure from both the Lib Dems and the Greens in the polls. Both are preparing a series of measures on climate change, while the Greens performed strongly at the European elections. Labour would amend the Climate Change Act to instruct the Committee on Climate Change to include an assessment of our \u201ctotal footprint emissions\u201d in their annual report to parliament.",

At one point the louche dinner party guests, working hard to eat themselves to death, sit around licking the marrow from roasted bones. As Henderson once told me, a lightbulb illuminated above his head. \u201cI thought, there\u2019s a dish for me.\u201d He added a parsley salad, a heap of salt and some toasted sourdough, and created one of the single most copied plates of food of the last quarter century, and rightly so. The shiny gems of marrow melt into the sturdy platform of the toast. A flake or two of salt makes it sing. The bright, acidic parsley salad cuts through the richness.</p> <p>I\u2019ve eaten knock-offs all over the world, often made by chefs who\u2019ve never eaten the original but seen enough pictures to know the principles are sound. And now, 25 years later, I am sitting in <a href=\"https://www.blackaxemangal.com/\" title=\"\">Black Axe Mangal</a> in London\u2019s Highbury, eating a pimped version, with go-faster stripes, an aerofoil, a paint job and something involving fuel injection under the hood. The marrow has been topped with a tangle of long-braised oxtail, to literally put some meat back on the bones. It has then been roasted to a crisp. Anchovy is involved. The sourdough has been replaced with a slab of fluffy, singed and blistered flatbread, which belches hot doughy air as you tear. On the side, beneath a thick mustardy vinaigrette, is a candy-coloured red onion and parsley salad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6667f2c748d47031d3f3f079a69cab58331915c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6667f2c748d47031d3f3f079a69cab58331915c4/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Homage to a London classic, with go-faster stripes: BAM\u2019s roasted bone marrow and onion and parsley salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Homage to a London classic, with go-faster stripes: BAM\u2019s roasted bone marrow and onion and parsley salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a comically huge plate of food, which slaps you round the chops and slaps you again just to be sure. And then shouts in your ear and finally kicks you in the shins. Even so the lily has not been gilded. Black Axe Mangal\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jun/24/recipe-crispy-chicken-thighs-curry-chips-spicy-tofu-fried-eggs-lee-tiernan-guest-cook\" title=\"\">Lee Tiernan</a> spent years as the head chef of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2003/aug/17/foodanddrink.shopping2\" title=\"\">St John Bread and Wine</a>, the spin-off from the mothership, and cooked the original more than enough times to understand the fundamentals.

BAM, as it calls itself onomatopoeically, first opened nearly four years ago and all the reports were of huge flavours and noise and queues. You went. You waited, perhaps for an hour or more. You sat in a cramped space with room for just two dozen, with an open kitchen dominated by a graffitied wood-fired oven. Tatted cooks did muscular things with the good food. Guitars roared, cocktails flowed and everybody got sweaty and fed. It sounded like a hoot \u2013 just not necessarily my hoot.</p> <p>Three years on, and circumstance presents an opportunity. I have been let down by a new restaurant which cancelled its opening and forgot to mention it. Charmed, I\u2019m sure. So I head with my companion to Highbury Corner where I know there are choices. One is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/jul/25/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-trullo\" title=\"\">Trullo</a>, which I have already reviewed. (And very nice it is too.) One of them is closed, because it\u2019s a Monday. Which leaves BAM and, praise be, they have a table. The music does indeed boom, though not so you can\u2019t hold a conversation. Still, if you fret about restaurant noise, you won\u2019t enjoy this. That\u2019s fine. There are plenty of other places for the likes of you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3a51d39d9423b9dbb17f6e9f8eac737fb9ed84e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3a51d39d9423b9dbb17f6e9f8eac737fb9ed84e/294_482_5014_3009/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018It surfs a wave of sultry heat and sweet\u2019: crispy f\u2019in rabbit with sweet chilli and apple.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It surfs a wave of sultry heat and sweet\u2019: crispy f\u2019in rabbit with sweet chilli and apple.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019re not sure, take the risk. Come let the food rattle your eyeballs. Tiernan (who happens not to be here tonight) has described BAM as a mash-up of bistro and the Turkish mangal grill houses he so adores. The menu changes according to what\u2019s good. Tonight, it starts with a \u201ccrispy fuckin rabbit\u201d with sweet chilli and apple. The meat has been slow cooked, formed into a pleasing rectangle, then breaded and deep fried. It is indeed very crisp and very meaty and surfs a wave of sultry heat and sweet courtesy of the slutty sauce it sits upon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f4409a10bebd539f743b00564ce06d952e17490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f4409a10bebd539f743b00564ce06d952e17490/0_0_4880_3576/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Essentially a Reuben sandwich with new tailoring\u2019: salt beef and sauerkraut bao.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"733\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Essentially a Reuben sandwich with new tailoring\u2019: salt beef and sauerkraut bao.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A salt beef and sauerkraut steamed bun is essentially a Reuben sandwich with new tailoring. It sits inside an Asian-style rice-dough folded bao, the softness of which gives way to a thick wodge of the cured meat and the crunch sour of the fermented cabbage. We have robust spears of green asparagus under a dollop of creamy goat\u2019s curd. Because the kitchen doesn\u2019t understand the word \u201cenough\u201d there\u2019s also bottarga \u2013 cured fish roe (usually grey mullet) grated over the top. It provides a rush of savoury and the sea.</p> <p>A short while ago the food-writing world, or the \u201cgutserati\u201d as I\u2019ve just decided to name them, laughed uproariously at the opening of a new restaurant called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/sep/29/flavour-bastard-london-w1-restaurant-review-marina-oloughlin\" title=\"\">Flavour Bastard</a>, as though that was ever going to fly.

A salad of brown shrimp and white cabbage is meant, I think, to be a way of contrasting the nutty bite of the tiny seafood commas against the brusque crunch of the cabbage, but the dressing is salty and one-note. Still, with the small plates priced at around \u00a38, it feels like an affordable misstep. I\u2019m disappointed that the crispy pig cheek, kimchi and burnt lime is finished because they sound like words I could be terrific friends with. Happily, there\u2019s a huge Barnsley chop, the fat-ribboned lamb having taken a virtuous journey through the flames alongside charred hispi cabbage, all of it bathed in the warm benediction of shrimp butter.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afdf23ca552624c63bb124a33d4c745326291a90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afdf23ca552624c63bb124a33d4c745326291a90/127_215_5314_3188/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A righteous use of breakfast cereal\u2019: Crunchy Nut choc ice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A righteous use of breakfast cereal\u2019: Crunchy Nut choc ice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans/The Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are just two desserts tonight: a mango lassi sorbet and a Crunchy Nut choc ice. I think you know which one we shared. There\u2019s a malted milk ice-cream centre beneath a chocolate shell shattering in all the right ways, courtesy of the title ingredient. After too many meals blighted by unwarranted outbreaks of granola, this is a righteous use of breakfast cereal.</p> <p>BAM is not for everyone. It\u2019s probably not for you. Or you. But you over there, you might like it. The place really is noisy, in all ways. They do keep some walk-ins, but at weekends you will have to queue. Given I\u2019m loathe to do so myself, I obviously can\u2019t recommend that. But if you do get a seat, I promise you it will be a meal that will leave a mark, of the right kind.</p> <h2>News bites</h2> <p>If the notion of roasted bone marrow is calling to you, the <strong><a href=\"https://thehawksmoor.com/\">Hawksmoor</a></strong> steakhouse group serves it in lots of different ways. In Manchester they\u2019ll give it to you hot with oysters. At Guildhall in the City of London, it\u2019s part of the huge cooked breakfast to share, and in Covent Garden it\u2019s a starter with onions.

      "bodyText": "Black Axe Mangal, 156 Canonbury Road, London N1 2UP (blackaxemangal.com). Small plates \u00a36-10.50; large plates \u00a315-24; desserts \u00a36-7.50; wines from \u00a330 One day in 1994, while waiting for his new restaurant to open, chef Fergus Henderson went to the Everyman Cinema in Hampstead along with all the other food pervs, for a screening of La Grande Bouffe. At one point the louche dinner party guests, working hard to eat themselves to death, sit around licking the marrow from roasted bones. As Henderson once told me, a lightbulb illuminated above his head. \u201cI thought, there\u2019s a dish for me.\u201d He added a parsley salad, a heap of salt and some toasted sourdough, and created one of the single most copied plates of food of the last quarter century, and rightly so. The shiny gems of marrow melt into the sturdy platform of the toast. A flake or two of salt makes it sing. The bright, acidic parsley salad cuts through the richness. I\u2019ve eaten knock-offs all over the world, often made by chefs who\u2019ve never eaten the original but seen enough pictures to know the principles are sound. And now, 25 years later, I am sitting in Black Axe Mangal in London\u2019s Highbury, eating a pimped version, with go-faster stripes, an aerofoil, a paint job and something involving fuel injection under the hood. The marrow has been topped with a tangle of long-braised oxtail, to literally put some meat back on the bones. It has then been roasted to a crisp. Anchovy is involved. The sourdough has been replaced with a slab of fluffy, singed and blistered flatbread, which belches hot doughy air as you tear. On the side, beneath a thick mustardy vinaigrette, is a candy-coloured red onion and parsley salad. It\u2019s a comically huge plate of food, which slaps you round the chops and slaps you again just to be sure. And then shouts in your ear and finally kicks you in the shins. Even so the lily has not been gilded. Black Axe Mangal\u2019s Lee Tiernan spent years as the head chef of St John Bread and Wine, the spin-off from the mothership, and cooked the original more than enough times to understand the fundamentals. But clearly it had to be his take. This very much is. None of this is news, in the sense of being new. BAM, as it calls itself onomatopoeically, first opened nearly four years ago and all the reports were of huge flavours and noise and queues. You went. You waited, perhaps for an hour or more. You sat in a cramped space with room for just two dozen, with an open kitchen dominated by a graffitied wood-fired oven. Tatted cooks did muscular things with the good food. Guitars roared, cocktails flowed and everybody got sweaty and fed. It sounded like a hoot \u2013 just not necessarily my hoot. Three years on, and circumstance presents an opportunity. I have been let down by a new restaurant which cancelled its opening and forgot to mention it. Charmed, I\u2019m sure. So I head with my companion to Highbury Corner where I know there are choices. One is Trullo, which I have already reviewed. (And very nice it is too.) One of them is closed, because it\u2019s a Monday. Which leaves BAM and, praise be, they have a table. The music does indeed boom, though not so you can\u2019t hold a conversation. Still, if you fret about restaurant noise, you won\u2019t enjoy this. That\u2019s fine. There are plenty of other places for the likes of you. If you\u2019re not sure, take the risk. Come let the food rattle your eyeballs. Tiernan (who happens not to be here tonight) has described BAM as a mash-up of bistro and the Turkish mangal grill houses he so adores. The menu changes according to what\u2019s good. Tonight, it starts with a \u201ccrispy fuckin rabbit\u201d with sweet chilli and apple. The meat has been slow cooked, formed into a pleasing rectangle, then breaded and deep fried. It is indeed very crisp and very meaty and surfs a wave of sultry heat and sweet courtesy of the slutty sauce it sits upon. A salt beef and sauerkraut steamed bun is essentially a Reuben sandwich with new tailoring. It sits inside an Asian-style rice-dough folded bao, the softness of which gives way to a thick wodge of the cured meat and the crunch sour of the fermented cabbage. We have robust spears of green asparagus under a dollop of creamy goat\u2019s curd. Because the kitchen doesn\u2019t understand the word \u201cenough\u201d there\u2019s also bottarga \u2013 cured fish roe (usually grey mullet) grated over the top. It provides a rush of savoury and the sea. A short while ago the food-writing world, or the \u201cgutserati\u201d as I\u2019ve just decided to name them, laughed uproariously at the opening of a new restaurant called Flavour Bastard, as though that was ever going to fly. The website now just carries the petulant words \u201cFlavour Bastard has now shut and will not reopen.\u201d If any restaurant ever deserved to inherit the name as a subtitle, it\u2019s BAM. Not every dish works. A salad of brown shrimp and white cabbage is meant, I think, to be a way of contrasting the nutty bite of the tiny seafood commas against the brusque crunch of the cabbage, but the dressing is salty and one-note. Still, with the small plates priced at around \u00a38, it feels like an affordable misstep. I\u2019m disappointed that the crispy pig cheek, kimchi and burnt lime is finished because they sound like words I could be terrific friends with. Happily, there\u2019s a huge Barnsley chop, the fat-ribboned lamb having taken a virtuous journey through the flames alongside charred hispi cabbage, all of it bathed in the warm benediction of shrimp butter. There are just two desserts tonight: a mango lassi sorbet and a Crunchy Nut choc ice. I think you know which one we shared. There\u2019s a malted milk ice-cream centre beneath a chocolate shell shattering in all the right ways, courtesy of the title ingredient. After too many meals blighted by unwarranted outbreaks of granola, this is a righteous use of breakfast cereal. BAM is not for everyone. It\u2019s probably not for you. Or you. But you over there, you might like it. The place really is noisy, in all ways. They do keep some walk-ins, but at weekends you will have to queue. Given I\u2019m loathe to do so myself, I obviously can\u2019t recommend that. But if you do get a seat, I promise you it will be a meal that will leave a mark, of the right kind. News bites If the notion of roasted bone marrow is calling to you, the Hawksmoor steakhouse group serves it in lots of different ways. In Manchester they\u2019ll give it to you hot with oysters. At Guildhall in the City of London, it\u2019s part of the huge cooked breakfast to share, and in Covent Garden it\u2019s a starter with onions. It\u2019s also offered across the group as an extra with various cuts of steak. Rules, London\u2019s oldest restaurant, has quietly introduced an afternoon cream tea, which is being served in what was once the private dining room where Edward VII entertained his mistress, Lillie Langtry. Tea costs \u00a329.75 per person and includes savoury canapes, followed by scones, cream and jam and then a choice of cakes including Victoria sponge, lemon drizzle and gingerbread with orange. And it\u2019s a sad farewell to Monty\u2019s Deli in London\u2019s Hoxton Street, famed for its salt beef, pastrami and latkes among many other things.

But when it comes to hard sales data, perhaps the most remarkable transformation has been the switch to pink. Sales of ros\u00e9 have grown by 30% globally in the 2010s, during which time the French started drinking more ros\u00e9 than white, and the British became besotted with a specific French style. Provence is the place that really pushed pastel prettiness into the glasses of previous ros\u00e9-sceptics (such as your correspondent).

But when it comes to hard sales data, perhaps the most remarkable transformation has been the switch to pink. Sales of ros\u00e9 have grown by 30% globally in the 2010s, during which time the French started drinking more ros\u00e9 than white, and the British became besotted with a specific French style. Provence is the place that really pushed pastel prettiness into the glasses of previous ros\u00e9-sceptics (such as your correspondent). And it remains the rose-gold standard, even as the wines command something of a premium. Offers abound at the height of ros\u00e9 season, such as Waitrose\u2019s promo on the textbook gentle berry and just-out-the-box freshness of English-run producer Mirabeau.

      "body": "<p>The date was 15 July 1969. As the Saturn V rocket towered over the launchpad, about to send the first men to the moon, two dozen black families from poor parts of the south, accompanied by mules and wagons emblematic of the civil rights movement, marched to the fence of <a href=\"https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/\">Cape </a><a href=\"https://www.kennedyspacecenter.com/\">Kennedy in Florida</a>. From a bird\u2019s eye view, they would have resembled dwarves in the wake of a colossus.<br><br>They were led by <a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0311.html\">Ralph Abernathy</a>, successor to the slain Martin Luther King as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He carried a sign that said bluntly: \u201c$12 a day to feed an astronaut. We could feed a starving child for $8.\u201d He told a rally at the site: \u201cWe may go on from this day to Mars and to Jupiter and even to the heavens beyond, but as long as racism, poverty and hunger and war prevail on the Earth, we as a civilised nation have failed.\u201d<br><br>The Apollo 11 mission has been hailed as humankind\u2019s greatest technological achievement and, after the turmoil of the 1960s, a redemptive moment of national and international unity.

While Nasa warned Congress \u201cNo bucks, no Buck Rogers\u201d, polls showed a majority of Americans opposed the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/09/moondoggle-the-forgotten-opposition-to-the-apollo-program/262254/\">\u201cmoondoggle\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The black press questioned how the price tag could be justified when millions of African Americans were still mired in poverty.

Abernathy then gave a short speech. He deplored the condition of the nation\u2019s poor, declaring that one-fifth of the nation lacked adequate food, clothing, shelter and medical care. In the face of such suffering, he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority. He urged that its funds be spent to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, tend the sick and house the homeless.</p> <p>\u201cPaine replied that \u2018if we could solve the problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button\u2019. He added that Nasa\u2019s technical advances were \u2018child\u2019s play\u2019 compared to \u2018the tremendously difficult human problems\u2019 that concerned the SCLC. He offered the hope that Nasa indeed might contribute to addressing these problems, and then asked Abernathy, a minister, to pray for the safety of the astronauts. Abernathy answered with emotion that he would certainly do this, and they ended this impromptu meeting by shaking hands all around.\u201d</p> <p>Among the protesters at Cape Kennedy (now know as Cape Canaveral) that day was <a href=\"http://crdl.usg.edu/export/html/ffc/crlsa/crdl_ffc_crlsa_879.html?Welcome\">JT Johnson,</a> a civil rights activist who had been with King in Memphis shortly before he died and became a close aide to Abernathy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want you too close to where it was launching, so we just picked us a spot and decided to have us a rally and started talking and singing \u2013 the songs brought us through these difficult times \u2013 and we just did what we do,\u201d Johnson recalled in an interview at his home in a suburb of Atlanta.</p> <p>\u201cAt that time, the whole movement was around poverty and poor people so that\u2019s all we talked about: how poor we are and how is this thing going to the moon and spending millions when we don\u2019t have any and some people don\u2019t have a place to live or food to eat, but we still allow all of these things to happen. That was the real protest: billions for the moon and pennies for the poor.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4395e65c40b63544a4ad7bd45bc30db838ce971c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4395e65c40b63544a4ad7bd45bc30db838ce971c/0_0_6604_4403/1000.jpg\" alt=\"JT Johnson at his home in Atlanta, Georgia.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">JT Johnson at his home in Atlanta, Georgia.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynsey Weatherspoon/The  Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>A project of white America</h2> <p>Johnson is now an 81-year-old grandfather. He\u2019s still politically active and hopes to tell more about the story of the civil rights movement. Wearing a blue T-shirt in his red dining room, he recalled growing up during the era of Jim Crow segregation <a href=\"https://www.montezuma-ga.org/\">in Montezuma, Georgia</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt had a big water fountain downtown with a \u2018colored\u2019 sign and a \u2018white\u2019 sign when all the water was coming from the same place,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a child I couldn\u2019t understand because most of these things didn\u2019t seem fair to me. So the Lord knew that I was going to be in the movement before I did, because I didn\u2019t know it and some of the things I just didn\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d</p> <p>As for so many, King became his lodestar. \u201cWhen I met Dr King, I thought that was the man I\u2019d been waiting to see for all of my life and I dedicated myself to the civil rights movement.\u201d</p> <p>In one protest in the 1960s, Johnson and others jumped into <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2014/06/13/321380585/remembering-a-civil-rights-swim-in-it-was-a-milestone\">a whites-only swimming pool in St Augustine, Florida</a>, only for the hotel owner to pour acid into the pool. After trying to integrate another swimming pool in Albany, Georgia, he was imprisoned for six days and went on hunger strike. In this context, President John F Kennedy\u2019s dream of putting a <a href=\"https://history.nasa.gov/moondec.html\">man on the moon by the end of the decade</a> seemed a luxury that America could not afford.</p> <p>\u201cI think it was all about PR really for the United States and Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this country has never really taken care of people here \u2026 African Americans never got their share; they spread it around everybody else.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, the Apollo programme gave every impression of being a project of white America. As footage of the era is replayed to mark the semicentennial, it is striking that all 12 people who walked on the moon were white men, and so too the overwhelming majority of officials, engineers and scientists at mission control. The musician and poet Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goh2x_G0ct4\">Whitey on the Moon</a> summed up: \u201cA rat done bit my sister Nell / With Whitey on the moon / Her face and arms began to swell / And Whitey\u2019s on the moon.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear an invitation; we didn\u2019t get anything.

      "bodyText": "The date was 15 July 1969. As the Saturn V rocket towered over the launchpad, about to send the first men to the moon, two dozen black families from poor parts of the south, accompanied by mules and wagons emblematic of the civil rights movement, marched to the fence of Cape Kennedy in Florida. From a bird\u2019s eye view, they would have resembled dwarves in the wake of a colossus. They were led by Ralph Abernathy, successor to the slain Martin Luther King as head of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He carried a sign that said bluntly: \u201c$12 a day to feed an astronaut. We could feed a starving child for $8.\u201d He told a rally at the site: \u201cWe may go on from this day to Mars and to Jupiter and even to the heavens beyond, but as long as racism, poverty and hunger and war prevail on the Earth, we as a civilised nation have failed.\u201d The Apollo 11 mission has been hailed as humankind\u2019s greatest technological achievement and, after the turmoil of the 1960s, a redemptive moment of national and international unity. Speaking to astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on the lunar surface in what he described as \u201cthe most historic telephone call ever made\u201d, President Richard Nixon declared: \u201cFor one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one.\u201d Yet it was myth making then and will be again as America commemorates this month\u2019s 50th anniversary with events, exhibitions and TV specials. The Apollo programme, motivated by the space race against the Soviet Union, cost $25.4bn, the equivalent of $180bn today; only the Vietnam war hit taxpayers harder. While Nasa warned Congress \u201cNo bucks, no Buck Rogers\u201d, polls showed a majority of Americans opposed the \u201cmoondoggle\u201d. The black press questioned how the price tag could be justified when millions of African Americans were still mired in poverty. Testifying to the US Senate on race and urban poverty in 1966, King had observed \u201cin a few years we can be assured that we will set a man on the moon and with an adequate telescope he will be able to see the slums on Earth with their intensified congestion, decay and turbulence\u201d. \u2018An inhuman priority\u2019 The protest march on the eve of Apollo 11\u2019s launch opened a new chapter in the poor people\u2019s campaign, which had built a makeshift city at the National Mall in Washington a year earlier. Tom Paine, the administrator of Nasa, walked out to meet the demonstrators. An official Nasa history recalls: \u201cPaine stood coatless under a cloudy sky, accompanied only by Nasa\u2019s press officer, as Abernathy approached with his party, marching slowly and singing We Shall Overcome. \u201cSeveral mules were in the lead, as symbols of rural poverty. Abernathy then gave a short speech. He deplored the condition of the nation\u2019s poor, declaring that one-fifth of the nation lacked adequate food, clothing, shelter and medical care. In the face of such suffering, he asserted that space flight represented an inhuman priority. He urged that its funds be spent to feed the hungry, clothe the naked, tend the sick and house the homeless. \u201cPaine replied that \u2018if we could solve the problems of poverty by not pushing the button to launch men to the moon tomorrow, then we would not push that button\u2019. He added that Nasa\u2019s technical advances were \u2018child\u2019s play\u2019 compared to \u2018the tremendously difficult human problems\u2019 that concerned the SCLC. He offered the hope that Nasa indeed might contribute to addressing these problems, and then asked Abernathy, a minister, to pray for the safety of the astronauts. Abernathy answered with emotion that he would certainly do this, and they ended this impromptu meeting by shaking hands all around.\u201d Among the protesters at Cape Kennedy (now know as Cape Canaveral) that day was JT Johnson, a civil rights activist who had been with King in Memphis shortly before he died and became a close aide to Abernathy. \u201cThey didn\u2019t want you too close to where it was launching, so we just picked us a spot and decided to have us a rally and started talking and singing \u2013 the songs brought us through these difficult times \u2013 and we just did what we do,\u201d Johnson recalled in an interview at his home in a suburb of Atlanta. \u201cAt that time, the whole movement was around poverty and poor people so that\u2019s all we talked about: how poor we are and how is this thing going to the moon and spending millions when we don\u2019t have any and some people don\u2019t have a place to live or food to eat, but we still allow all of these things to happen. That was the real protest: billions for the moon and pennies for the poor.\u201d A project of white America Johnson is now an 81-year-old grandfather. He\u2019s still politically active and hopes to tell more about the story of the civil rights movement. Wearing a blue T-shirt in his red dining room, he recalled growing up during the era of Jim Crow segregation in Montezuma, Georgia. \u201cIt had a big water fountain downtown with a \u2018colored\u2019 sign and a \u2018white\u2019 sign when all the water was coming from the same place,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a child I couldn\u2019t understand because most of these things didn\u2019t seem fair to me. So the Lord knew that I was going to be in the movement before I did, because I didn\u2019t know it and some of the things I just didn\u2019t like. It wasn\u2019t fair.\u201d As for so many, King became his lodestar. \u201cWhen I met Dr King, I thought that was the man I\u2019d been waiting to see for all of my life and I dedicated myself to the civil rights movement.\u201d In one protest in the 1960s, Johnson and others jumped into a whites-only swimming pool in St Augustine, Florida, only for the hotel owner to pour acid into the pool. After trying to integrate another swimming pool in Albany, Georgia, he was imprisoned for six days and went on hunger strike. In this context, President John F Kennedy\u2019s dream of putting a man on the moon by the end of the decade seemed a luxury that America could not afford. \u201cI think it was all about PR really for the United States and Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this country has never really taken care of people here \u2026 African Americans never got their share; they spread it around everybody else.\u201d Indeed, the Apollo programme gave every impression of being a project of white America. As footage of the era is replayed to mark the semicentennial, it is striking that all 12 people who walked on the moon were white men, and so too the overwhelming majority of officials, engineers and scientists at mission control. The musician and poet Gil Scott-Heron\u2019s Whitey on the Moon summed up: \u201cA rat done bit my sister Nell / With Whitey on the moon / Her face and arms began to swell / And Whitey\u2019s on the moon.\u201d Johnson said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t hear an invitation; we didn\u2019t get anything. So we thought that was a disgrace and a disrespect to all of us \u2026 It was white people that was privileged in this country and they\u2019d made it like that for themselves.\u201d \u2018A proud American\u2019 Johnson did not linger at Cape Kennedy to witness the epic Saturn V rocket launch. But like spellbound millions around the world, he did watch on TV when Armstrong set foot on the lunar surface. He recalled: \u201cI guess it was exciting to see that happen, to be very frank with you, but here again the next day we were going back to the same thing. How do we feed our hungry?\u201d Others, however, felt differently. Abernathy did stay to watch the launch in person. A college professor and maths teacher, he was not opposed to Apollo per se, but rather \u201cthe nation\u2019s distorted sense of national priorities\u201d. His daughter, Donzaleigh, who was an 11-year-old girl at the time, said by phone: \u201cHe wanted to bring attention to the fact that we\u2019re spending billions to send men to the moon yet we cannot feed hungry children in America.

According to Neil Maher, an associate professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University, although Nasa never stated publicly that Abernathy\u2019s protest pressured it to address the poverty of African Americans, it began taking steps to address those problems soon after. \u201cIn 1972 the space agency created an Urban Systems Project Office at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, which retooled technologies deployed for Apollo for use instead in America\u2019s inner cities,\u201d Maher, author of Apollo in the Age of Aquarius, said via email. \u201cSuch \u2018spin-offs\u2019 included water filtration systems, air pollution monitoring technologies, and even energy efficient heating and cooling systems from the Apollo space capsule for use instead in low-income housing projects. \u201cWhile such efforts had the best of intentions, many of these technologies unfortunately failed to dramatically improve the daily life of African Americans living in America\u2019s cities.\u201d After Armstrong\u2019s giant leap for mankind, the novelty quickly wore off, public interest in moon landings waned and doubts over the expense of it all only intensified.

      "body": "<p>A dowager type, a minor character in a whimsical British film made before the Second World War (<em>Once In A New Moon</em>, since you ask), is quite emphatic about the perils of generosity to the lower classes:</p> <p>\u201cGive them an inch and they will take an ell,\u201d she proclaims in one scene. Today most of her audience would be much more familiar with the common usage, \u201cGive them an inch and they will take a mile\u201d. But, as proverbs go, that has always sounded a bit off. A mile is just too long a distance to work properly. And, sure enough, an \u201cell\u201d is a forearm\u2019s length to the elbow, measured by making the shape of a letter \u201cL\u201d.</p> <p>It is a nice reminder of what we lose when a phrase is modernised or superseded. Not only can a bit of sense be mislaid, but memory of the original form is soon obliterated.</p> <p>Recently we have exchanged \u201cin the olden days\u201d for the American idiom \u201cback in the day\u201d on a fairly wholesale basis. It probably just sounded a bit cooler to someone once and has now wiped out nearly all trace of its predecessor. It is not so much the change I mourn, but the forgetting. It is a sign of how adaptable language is, yet also a tiny symptom of human ability to unconsciously vaporise the past.</p> <p>Our parliamentarians are not much cop at passing key legislation, but they do get a lot of airtime and so have more impact on language than they should. In the past few years the word \u201csubstantive\u201d, favoured by politicians, has taken over from the word \u201csubstantial\u201d by those who want to make a point in the voice of authority.</p> <p>The words do not mean quite the same thing though. The first is closer to \u201cbig\u201d, while the second is comparative. It is not an \u201cell\u201d of a difference, but it is there and we should not forget.</p> <p>\u2022 Vanessa Thorpe is the Observer\u2019s arts and media correspondent </p>",

      "bodyText": "A dowager type, a minor character in a whimsical British film made before the Second World War (Once In A New Moon, since you ask), is quite emphatic about the perils of generosity to the lower classes: \u201cGive them an inch and they will take an ell,\u201d she proclaims in one scene. Today most of her audience would be much more familiar with the common usage, \u201cGive them an inch and they will take a mile\u201d. But, as proverbs go, that has always sounded a bit off. A mile is just too long a distance to work properly. And, sure enough, an \u201cell\u201d is a forearm\u2019s length to the elbow, measured by making the shape of a letter \u201cL\u201d. It is a nice reminder of what we lose when a phrase is modernised or superseded. Not only can a bit of sense be mislaid, but memory of the original form is soon obliterated. Recently we have exchanged \u201cin the olden days\u201d for the American idiom \u201cback in the day\u201d on a fairly wholesale basis. It probably just sounded a bit cooler to someone once and has now wiped out nearly all trace of its predecessor. It is not so much the change I mourn, but the forgetting. It is a sign of how adaptable language is, yet also a tiny symptom of human ability to unconsciously vaporise the past. Our parliamentarians are not much cop at passing key legislation, but they do get a lot of airtime and so have more impact on language than they should. In the past few years the word \u201csubstantive\u201d, favoured by politicians, has taken over from the word \u201csubstantial\u201d by those who want to make a point in the voice of authority. The words do not mean quite the same thing though. The first is closer to \u201cbig\u201d, while the second is comparative. It is not an \u201cell\u201d of a difference, but it is there and we should not forget. \u2022 Vanessa Thorpe is the Observer\u2019s arts and media correspondent",

Her words echo sentiments expressed by many Jewish MPs, members and supporters in recent months, and are a dreadful indictment of Labour\u2019s failure to confront and root out antisemitism within its ranks.</p> \n<p>The documentary brought to light fresh allegations about interference from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office in disciplinary procedures supposed to be independent of the party\u2019s leadership. It found that, as recently as this spring, 1,000 complaints about antisemitism had yet to be dealt with, and so far only 15 people have been expelled as a result. But the most powerful moments of the programme were in the brave testimony of party members and staff who spoke of their experience of dealing with antisemitism and its impact on their mental health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c1f2e7d6-2d93-4b70-aba4-b64e69487ee8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FThSEAMxzVw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Before the programme was broadcast, Labour dismissed the whistleblowers \u2013 one of whom told the programme he had suicidal thoughts while he was working for the party \u2013 as \u201cdisaffected former officials\u201d with \u201cpolitical axes to grind\u201d, and threatened to sue them for breaking non-disclosure agreements.

Corbyn has been under scrutiny for the way his party deals with cases of antisemitism for more than three years: in 2016, the home affairs select committee was damning about <a href=\"https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmhaff/136/136.pdf\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s disciplinary processes</a>. Yet he has failed to get a grip on this, appearing not to care sufficiently to have made it a priority.</p> \n<p>Serious questions remain about the lack of action taken against high-profile Corbyn allies accused of antisemitism.</p> \n<p>Last month, Chris Williamson MP had the Labour whip reinstated after being <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jun/28/labour-mps-make-third-attempt-to-censure-chris-williamson\" title=\"\">suspended</a> for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism, when a panel ruled he should only receive a reprimand (the suspension was reinstated following a backlash from MPs and peers).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a81b14033a196caed6e2d874cc95ffc6ad4f6450\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a81b14033a196caed6e2d874cc95ffc6ad4f6450/1682_341_1483_1854/800.jpg\" alt=\"Pete Willsman\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An investigation into Pete Willsman is pending</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In May, Pete Willsman was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/may/31/israeli-embassy-labour-antisemitism-claims-peter-willsman\" title=\"\">suspended for alleged antisemitism</a> for the second time in 10 months when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/jul/31/corbyn-ally-says-jewish-trump-fanatics-make-up-antisemitism-claims\" title=\"\">a recording emerged</a> of him accusing the Israeli embassy of \u201cwhipping up\u201d complaints against Labour.

This contrasts starkly with the speed with which Alastair Campbell <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/may/28/labour-expels-alastair-campbell-from-party\" title=\"\">was expelled </a>from the party after saying he didn\u2019t vote Labour in the European elections: it took just two days.</p> \n<p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/inquiries-and-investigations/investigation-labour-party\" title=\"\">is conducting</a> a statutory investigation into antisemitism in the party, but it is likely to be months before it reports. Labour must act now. As a minimum, it must introduce an independent disciplinary process that is transparent about the number of complaints it is dealing with, the rate at which they are being processed, and their outcomes.</p> \n<p>But reforming processes is not enough: Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem is one of culture, not just procedure. Of course antisemitism is not limited to the left. But the nature of antisemitic tropes that paint Jewish people as a malign, controlling influence of the world means that some on the left have been particularly susceptible, even as they loudly proclaim themselves anti-racists. And in among his vows that Labour stands against \u201call forms of racism\u201d, and the implication that Labour\u2019s problems with antisemitism are merely a product of the fact that it exists in society at large, Corbyn has failed to acknowledge this. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, last week said that the Labour leadership was directly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chiefrabbi/status/1149085034793582599?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1149085034793582599&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.express.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2F1151964%2FLabour-party-anti-semitism-jeremy-corbyn-bbc-panaroma-is-labour-anti-semitic\" title=\"\">complicit</a> in the scourge of antisemitism.

The documentary brought to light fresh allegations about interference from Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s office in disciplinary procedures supposed to be independent of the party\u2019s leadership. It found that, as recently as this spring, 1,000 complaints about antisemitism had yet to be dealt with, and so far only 15 people have been expelled as a result. But the most powerful moments of the programme were in the brave testimony of party members and staff who spoke of their experience of dealing with antisemitism and its impact on their mental health. Before the programme was broadcast, Labour dismissed the whistleblowers \u2013 one of whom told the programme he had suicidal thoughts while he was working for the party \u2013 as \u201cdisaffected former officials\u201d with \u201cpolitical axes to grind\u201d, and threatened to sue them for breaking non-disclosure agreements. As reported in today\u2019s Observer, these whistleblowers are taking legal action against the party leadership for defaming them. Labour\u2019s official response denied that there was a problem with its disciplinary procedures, and asserted that the rate at which antisemitism cases are being dealt with has increased fourfold, without providing any evidence. This response marks a new low, but it is not out of character. Corbyn has been under scrutiny for the way his party deals with cases of antisemitism for more than three years: in 2016, the home affairs select committee was damning about Labour\u2019s disciplinary processes. Yet he has failed to get a grip on this, appearing not to care sufficiently to have made it a priority. Serious questions remain about the lack of action taken against high-profile Corbyn allies accused of antisemitism. Last month, Chris Williamson MP had the Labour whip reinstated after being suspended for suggesting the party was \u201ctoo apologetic\u201d about antisemitism, when a panel ruled he should only receive a reprimand (the suspension was reinstated following a backlash from MPs and peers). In May, Pete Willsman was suspended for alleged antisemitism for the second time in 10 months when a recording emerged of him accusing the Israeli embassy of \u201cwhipping up\u201d complaints against Labour. The investigation into Willsman is pending and he remains a member of Labour\u2019s national executive committee. This contrasts starkly with the speed with which Alastair Campbell was expelled from the party after saying he didn\u2019t vote Labour in the European elections: it took just two days. The Equality and Human Rights Commission is conducting a statutory investigation into antisemitism in the party, but it is likely to be months before it reports. Labour must act now. As a minimum, it must introduce an independent disciplinary process that is transparent about the number of complaints it is dealing with, the rate at which they are being processed, and their outcomes. But reforming processes is not enough: Labour\u2019s antisemitism problem is one of culture, not just procedure. Of course antisemitism is not limited to the left. But the nature of antisemitic tropes that paint Jewish people as a malign, controlling influence of the world means that some on the left have been particularly susceptible, even as they loudly proclaim themselves anti-racists. And in among his vows that Labour stands against \u201call forms of racism\u201d, and the implication that Labour\u2019s problems with antisemitism are merely a product of the fact that it exists in society at large, Corbyn has failed to acknowledge this. The chief rabbi, Ephraim Mirvis, last week said that the Labour leadership was directly complicit in the scourge of antisemitism. It is to Labour\u2019s great shame that he is right.",

Many state numerous skincare benefits (I\u2019ve personally found these supposed perks to my epidermis mythical) so I understand why people fall for those. What I don\u2019t understand is why the many products that don\u2019t promise much \u2013 they make ambiguous statements like \u2018it will revitalise your skin\u2019. I mean, what does that even mean? \u2013 still have ardent followers. If you can\u2019t resist the sensorial aspect of spritzing something on your face to battle heat or the dehydrating \u2018air\u2019 that is the stalwart of many an office, at least choose something that goes beyond \u2018refreshing\u2019 the skin. This antioxidant-rich offering by Caudalie (not new but has had a summer makeover) is quite easily one of the best on the market. The tingly concoction of rosemary, myrrh, orange blossom, grape and mint is like a wake-up call for fatigued skin \u2013 and it smells glorious. It refines the look of pores and helps with microcirculation so your skin is more resistant to the grim air-conditioning system.

Many state numerous skincare benefits (I\u2019ve personally found these supposed perks to my epidermis mythical) so I understand why people fall for those. What I don\u2019t understand is why the many products that don\u2019t promise much \u2013 they make ambiguous statements like \u2018it will revitalise your skin\u2019. I mean, what does that even mean? \u2013 still have ardent followers. If you can\u2019t resist the sensorial aspect of spritzing something on your face to battle heat or the dehydrating \u2018air\u2019 that is the stalwart of many an office, at least choose something that goes beyond \u2018refreshing\u2019 the skin. This antioxidant-rich offering by Caudalie (not new but has had a summer makeover) is quite easily one of the best on the market. The tingly concoction of rosemary, myrrh, orange blossom, grape and mint is like a wake-up call for fatigued skin \u2013 and it smells glorious. It refines the look of pores and helps with microcirculation so your skin is more resistant to the grim air-conditioning system.

Warren raised $19m in the second quarter. Sanders raised $18.2m. The Sanders campaign has emphasized his role in pushing policy ideas like Medicare for All and free college into the mainstream. Warren has grabbed attention with proposals including an immigration plan. Groans and eye rolls Netroots also provided a pulse check on progressive support for the other presidential hopefuls. Unsurprisingly, there was not much love for Biden. On Friday, dozens of immigration activists held a demonstration at his campaign headquarters in the city with family members of people deported by the Obama administration. On a wall at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, attendees could bet on who will drop out next, an exercise seemingly based more on wishful thinking than reality. As of Saturday morning, Biden and Sanders led the way. No one was betting on Warren or Harris. Any mention of Tom Steyer, the billionaire who jumped in this week, elicited groans and eye rolls. There was little patience for candidates like the Montana governor, Steve Bullock, or former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper, moderates who some urged to run for the Senate instead. The conference also took place amid a bitter row between the House Democratic leadership and a group of newly elected members known as \u201cthe Squad\u201d: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar. Netroots welcomed Pressley, Tlaib and Omar with applause and a standing ovation. \u201cThe women of color who entered Congress \u2013 they\u2019re more than four votes,\u201d said Aimee Allison, founder of She the People and moderator, referring to comments Pelosi made to the New York Times about the political influence of \u201cthe Squad\u201d. \u201cFor millions of us, these women of color in Congress represent generations of blood, sweat and tears and struggle for us to have representation. And yet, if you\u2019ve read the news, they\u2019ve faced attacks all year from the right wing and from Democratic party leadership.\u201d That prompted boos. Omar referred to \u201ca constant struggle with people who have power about sharing that power\u201d and said: \u201cWe are not really in the business of asking for the share of that power. We\u2019re in the business of trying to grab that power and return it to the people.\u201d In a session titled \u201cWhy Biden Is The Least Electable Major Democrat in 2020\u201d, one audience member asked: \u201cWould you support Biden if he were the nominee?\u201d All of the panelists emphatically agreed that they would. But they said there was little evidence that nominating an \u201colder white man who appeals to moderates\u201d would help beat Donald Trump. \u201cWhat are we so afraid of?\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a New York-based progressive strategist. \u201cEvery time we show someone who is Republican-lite, we lose.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The ban on exporting live sheep from Australia to the Middle East could be extended to the end of September due to the risk of heat stress under a proposal from federal regulators. If approved it would extend the three-month ban on live sheep export to the region, which began in June in response to public backlash to whistleblower footage of a voyage on which more than 2,000 sheep died. The June-August ban was announced by the Department of Agriculture in May after the live export industry had already announced it would enforce a self-imposed moratorium on shipping during those months in an effort to \u201creset\u201d the trade. Extending the ban to 30 September was one of three options put forward by the department as part of a public consultation process into managing the live trade in September and October. A second option proposes extending the ban to 30 September for destinations in the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea, like Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates; while the ban on trade to ports in the Red Sea would only be extended to 22 September. The department stated the third option, which would see the ban lifted on 1 September, was not preferred. It is yet to determine whether the export to the Middle East will be allowed in high-risk months from 2020 onward. The department said that based on the available evidence on average temperatures and sheep mortality rates in September, it \u201cbelieves this option [of resuming trade on 1 September] presents a higher risk of heat stress event, and does not prefer this option\u201d. \u201cThe options take into account evidence that demonstrates September remains as hot, or hotter than June and has historically experienced the third highest average monthly mortality rates after July and August,\u201d it said. The average mortality rate for sheep on live export ships to the Middle East in September, calculated from voyage reports logged with parliament for shipments between 2013 and 2017, is just over 0.8%. The month with the highest average mortality rate was August, with 1.25%, followed by July with just under 1%. The deadly voyage on the Awassi Express in August 2017, which triggered the review of Australia\u2019s heat stress guidelines and the ban on summer voyages, had a mortality rate of 3.76%, or 2,400 sheep. The RSPCA says that allowing the live sheep trade to resume in September was not supported by the department\u2019s own evidence on the impact of heat stress, as set out in the draft Heat Stress Risk Assessment (HSRA) report released in December. The final HSRA report was given to government in May but has not been publicly released. The RSPCA\u2019s senior policy officer, Dr Jed Goodfellow, urged the department not to be swayed against its own advice and lift the ban on 1 September. Goodfellow said he was disappointed that none of the proposed options suggested extending the ban into October. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cAllowing exports to continue during this high-risk period will mean subjecting thousands of winter-acclimatised Australian sheep to prolonged periods of heat stress and suffering in sweltering Middle Eastern conditions,\u201d he said. The Australian Veterinary Association has warned that the sheep would be at risk of heat stress on live export ships from May to October, and the RSPCA has previously called for live export to be banned for the full six months. \u201cThe evidence to-date is clear \u2013 sheep will suffer if exported during September and October, the same way they suffer in June, July and August, under the very same conditions that finally forced the industry to implement a voluntary halt,\u201d Goodfellow said. \u201cAny decision to continue the export of sheep in September and October is placing profits ahead of animal welfare.\u201d The proposed options for regulating the September and October live sheep export trade is open for public comment until 22 July.",

Roger Dargaville, a senior lecturer in renewable energy at Monash University and member of the Energy Transition Hub, underlines the amount of work that is going into examining what a future of clean exports will look like. A recent project he was involved in suggested a 40-gigawatt sub-sea electricity cable into Indonesia \u2013 much larger than that initially proposed by the Asian Renewable Energy Hub \u2013 would be viable by 2035 if that country adopts a low emissions target. Dargaville believes future exports will almost certainly be a mix of hydrogen, cabled electricity and minerals refined before shipment. He says no one should underestimate the scale of what would be necessary to replace Australia\u2019s existing fossil fuel industries (coal and LNG industries are worth more than $100bn a year and employ tens of thousands) and that the political and technological challenges will be significant. But he stresses no one should mistake where international markets are taking us. The only question is whether it is in the timeframe climate scientists says is necessary. \u201cIt\u2019s not really yes or no, it\u2019s just when.\u201d",
