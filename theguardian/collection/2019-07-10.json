The oil boss spoke out against the mounting opposition to its arts funding after high-profile protests targeted its support for the Royal Shakespeare Company, the British Museum and the National Portrait Awards. He told a Chatham House event that the recent spate of protests is \u201cvery curious\u201d and \u201cjust feels odd\u201d when there is \u201coverwhelming feedback\u201d in support of its arts funding. \u201cThe rest of the world finds this the oddest approach,\u201d he added. In response Culture Unstrained, a campaign group hoping to end oil sponsorship in the arts, said Dudley\u2019s comments \u201cseem out of touch with reality\u201d given the high-profile and widespread opposition to BP\u2019s sponsorship across the cultural sector in recent weeks. Actor Sir Mark Rylance resigned from the Royal Shakespeare Company last month, saying that BP\u2019s sponsorship deal allowed the company to \u201cobscure the destructive reality of its activities\u201d on the environment. A judge and several leading artists also wrote to the director of the National Portrait Gallery on the eve of its annual awards last month calling for an end to its long-standing links to the company. In February, hundreds of people occupied the British Museum to object to its relationship with BP. The museum\u2019s director, Hartwig Fischer, has since rejected calls to drop its sponsorship deal with BP, and publicly endorsed the funding. Dudley acknowledged that climate demonstrators\u2019 anger over progress by the energy industry towards a lower carbon future is escalating. \u201cTensions are running high and we recognise there are real concerns being expressed \u2013 about BP, and about the energy sector more broadly,\u201d he said. BP\u2019s London headquarters were brought to a standstill after Greenpeace blockaded the company\u2019s entrance in early May, before climate protesters struck again at the company\u2019s annual general meeting later in the same month.

He advised that antisemitism complaints should be expedited and Corbyn should make a speech on the Middle East affirming Israel\u2019s right to exist.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe actually laughed at me \u2026 I thought he actually wanted to know how we tackle antisemitism within the Labour party.

Kat Buckingham, the former chief investigator in the disputes team, said she had a breakdown and had decided to leave the party.</p> \n<p><strong>\u201c</strong>I couldn\u2019t hold the tide and I felt so powerless and I felt guilty and I felt like I failed,\u201d she told the programme.</p> \n<p>Withers Green, a former disputes officer, was signed off with depression and anxiety, and signed an NDA in return for not having to work her notice.

It is simply untrue to say that there were any significant number of disagreements about what constituted antisemitism,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe emails \u2026 are simply about ensuring the NCC is held accountable for the length of time they take to hear cases and about protecting the party against any successful legal challenge on the basis of perceived bias if the same panel is used in high-profile cases.</p> \n<p>\u201cLabour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased fourfold.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier, Labour released a letter of complaint to the BBC about the programme, saying it \u201crelies heavily and one-sidedly on the claims and allegations of politically partisan anonymous/unnamed sources and Conservative-supporting newspapers and organisations\u201d.</p>",

Four of the whistleblowers, including former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol, who left his post last year, have broken non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to come forward.

Former officials allege key aides including Labour\u2019s director of communications, Seumas Milne, and the current general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal email address was also copied into leaked email chains, which former officials allege show interference. Labour robustly denies any interference and said that \u201cformer disaffected employees sought the view of staff in the leader\u2019s office, which was complied with in good faith\u201d. The party and leftwing grassroots group Momentum have launched an online fightback against the programme and its reporter John Ware, as revealed in a leaked strategy document aimed at pro-Corbyn social media \u201coutriders\u201d rather than journalists, first reported by the Huffington Post. The strategy apparently urges them to draw attention to a Channel 4 Dispatches programme on Conservative Islamophobia and repeatedly to stress that the Labour leader was not antisemitic and the party was dealing with the problem. It is unclear who authored the advice, which suggested that Corbyn supporters \u201cmake sure the truth about Jeremy &amp; Jennie drowns out everything \u2026 Under your posts you will be trolled for daring to tell the truth.\u201d In the Panorama programme broadcast on Wednesday night, the officials allege: The number of antisemitism complaints received by Labour\u2019s compliance unit increased hugely after Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015. Senior aides contributed to substantial disagreements within the party about what constituted antisemitism. Aides in Corbyn\u2019s office directly processed complaints on at least one occasion. Formby attempted to interfere in the process of Labour\u2019s highest disciplinary body, the national constitutional committee, which has the authority to act independently and alone has the power to expel members.

She told the BBC she defied the NDA because she would not \u201cbe able to live with myself unless I speak up about the horrendous things that I know have been happening\u201d. A Labour spokesperson said the party was \u201cimplacably opposed to antisemitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society\u201d and said Corbyn had \u201cproactively addressed antisemitism within the party in direct communications to the party membership, in articles, speeches, videos and interviews\u201d. The party denied any attempt to intervene in the complaints process. \u201cThese disaffected former officials include those who have always opposed Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership, worked to actively undermine it, and have both personal and political axes to grind. It is simply untrue to say that there were any significant number of disagreements about what constituted antisemitism,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe emails \u2026 are simply about ensuring the NCC is held accountable for the length of time they take to hear cases and about protecting the party against any successful legal challenge on the basis of perceived bias if the same panel is used in high-profile cases. \u201cLabour is taking decisive action against antisemitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which antisemitism cases have been dealt with has increased fourfold.\u201d Earlier, Labour released a letter of complaint to the BBC about the programme, saying it \u201crelies heavily and one-sidedly on the claims and allegations of politically partisan anonymous/unnamed sources and Conservative-supporting newspapers and organisations\u201d.",

      "body": "<p>Applications from Chinese students to study at UK universities have gone up 30% since last year, with numbers exceeding those from Northern Ireland for the first time, according to official statistics.</p> <p>The Ucas university admissions agency revealed on Thursday it had received almost 20,000 undergraduate applications from students in China this year (19,760, up from 15,240 in 2018), compared with 18,520 from Northern Ireland. The real figure will be higher as not all Chinese applications are made via Ucas.</p> <p>The number of students from mainland China studying in UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/higher-education\">higher education</a> has more than doubled in the last decade. Commentators say however that <a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1003960/more-chinese-prefer-uk-and-canada-for-study-abroad%2C-report-says\">recent tensions between China and the US</a> are further benefitting British universities as Chinese students look at destinations other than America for their studies.</p> <p>Welcoming the figures, the universities minister, Chris Skidmore, said: \u201cInternational students bring huge cultural and economic benefits to the UK. These figures show we are making good progress in our ambition to open up world-leading higher education to anyone who has the potential to benefit from it and I\u2019m confident that we can go even further.\u201d</p> <p>The Ucas figures also revealed an increase in the number of British 18-year-olds applying for places, up 1% on last year to 275,520 despite a 1.9% fall in the overall 18-year-old population of the UK. EU applicants have also risen 1%, to 50,650 despite the Brexit uncertainty, and Ucas reported a record number of applicants from outside the EU at 81,340, an increase of 8%.</p> <p>China is already the biggest source of international students at British universities. In 2007-2008, there were 43,530 Chinese students in the UK, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). Ten years later the total went up to 106,530, of which 60,460 were postgraduate students and 46,070 undergraduates.</p> <p>Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said: \u201cThe global appeal of UK higher education has never been clearer, with record demographic-beating application rates in England and Wales, and the steep rise in international applications, especially from China.\u201d</p> <p>The University of Manchester has the largest population of Chinese students in Europe. With about 5,000 Chinese students out of a total of just over 40,000, about one in eight students are Chinese. \u201cThe university is well known in China,\u201d said Richard Cotton, director of student recruitment and outreach at Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s partly because of the football,\u201d he said. Then in 2015, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visited the National Graphene Institute (NGI) at Manchester university. \u201cWe did see a significant increase in applications [from China] after that.\u201d</p> <p>Chinese students are crucial to Manchester\u2019s ambitions to be a truly international university, says Cotton. \u201cYou can\u2019t project yourself as an international university unless you have large cohort of international students. They are bringing connections. In the classroom they can offer an international experience for domestic students.\u201d</p> <p>But there are challenges. Currently Chinese students are concentrated in a limited number of subject areas, such as accounting and finance, economics, business studies and electrical engineering. As a result, they often end up studying in classes full of other Chinese students and socialising together when classes are over.</p> <p>Tao Wang is a politics PhD student at the University of Manchester. He likes the diversity of the city, but there are difficulties too. \u201cIn the politics department, next to my desk is a Greek student, next to him is an Italian, and then a Briton, a Romanian, a French [student] and so on. Some of my best friends are from Nigeria, Mexico and Thailand. The diversity is the real beauty of Manchester that I truly love.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe challenge for me as a Chinese student is security,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many robberies. Rumours are that students from China are particularly targeted by robbers. This might be because of the stereotype that Chinese students are crazy rich.\u201d</p> <p>The university says it is doing all it can to improve student safety with regular police drop-in surgeries, the development of a student neighbourhood watch-style group called \u201cstudent eye\u201d and specific campaigns focussing on international student safety.</p> <p>The university is also developing research to try to find ways to encourage greater integration between Chinese and British students. \u201cStudents from both the UK and China are interested in each other,\u201d says Wang, \u201cbut it looks like they don\u2019t mix much. There is a cultural barrier.\u201d</p> <p>They also live separately. Chinese students are often in more expensive, purpose-built student flats, while British students live in shared houses. And according to Wang, the two groups socialise in completely different ways. \u201cChinese students like doing homework together, having a hotpot at home, singing karaoke, going shopping \u2013 for some, for luxury goods.</p> <p>\u201cBritish students particularly enjoy alcohol in pubs with loud music. I\u2019ve heard complaints from my Chinese friends that they couldn\u2019t make many local friends because they just didn\u2019t like pubs.\u201d</p> <p>Nick Hillman is a governor at Manchester university and director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank. Commenting on the latest Ucas application figures, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the UK is benefiting from cooler relations between China and the US, and also between China and Australia. We can\u2019t take anything for certain as demand from other countries is very sensitive to all sorts of things but we are clearly gaining advantage at the moment.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Applications from Chinese students to study at UK universities have gone up 30% since last year, with numbers exceeding those from Northern Ireland for the first time, according to official statistics. The Ucas university admissions agency revealed on Thursday it had received almost 20,000 undergraduate applications from students in China this year (19,760, up from 15,240 in 2018), compared with 18,520 from Northern Ireland. The real figure will be higher as not all Chinese applications are made via Ucas. The number of students from mainland China studying in UK higher education has more than doubled in the last decade. Commentators say however that recent tensions between China and the US are further benefitting British universities as Chinese students look at destinations other than America for their studies. Welcoming the figures, the universities minister, Chris Skidmore, said: \u201cInternational students bring huge cultural and economic benefits to the UK. These figures show we are making good progress in our ambition to open up world-leading higher education to anyone who has the potential to benefit from it and I\u2019m confident that we can go even further.\u201d The Ucas figures also revealed an increase in the number of British 18-year-olds applying for places, up 1% on last year to 275,520 despite a 1.9% fall in the overall 18-year-old population of the UK. EU applicants have also risen 1%, to 50,650 despite the Brexit uncertainty, and Ucas reported a record number of applicants from outside the EU at 81,340, an increase of 8%. China is already the biggest source of international students at British universities. In 2007-2008, there were 43,530 Chinese students in the UK, according to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa). Ten years later the total went up to 106,530, of which 60,460 were postgraduate students and 46,070 undergraduates. Clare Marchant, Ucas chief executive, said: \u201cThe global appeal of UK higher education has never been clearer, with record demographic-beating application rates in England and Wales, and the steep rise in international applications, especially from China.\u201d The University of Manchester has the largest population of Chinese students in Europe. With about 5,000 Chinese students out of a total of just over 40,000, about one in eight students are Chinese. \u201cThe university is well known in China,\u201d said Richard Cotton, director of student recruitment and outreach at Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s partly because of the football,\u201d he said. Then in 2015, the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, visited the National Graphene Institute (NGI) at Manchester university. \u201cWe did see a significant increase in applications [from China] after that.\u201d Chinese students are crucial to Manchester\u2019s ambitions to be a truly international university, says Cotton. \u201cYou can\u2019t project yourself as an international university unless you have large cohort of international students. They are bringing connections. In the classroom they can offer an international experience for domestic students.\u201d But there are challenges. Currently Chinese students are concentrated in a limited number of subject areas, such as accounting and finance, economics, business studies and electrical engineering. As a result, they often end up studying in classes full of other Chinese students and socialising together when classes are over. Tao Wang is a politics PhD student at the University of Manchester. He likes the diversity of the city, but there are difficulties too. \u201cIn the politics department, next to my desk is a Greek student, next to him is an Italian, and then a Briton, a Romanian, a French [student] and so on. Some of my best friends are from Nigeria, Mexico and Thailand. The diversity is the real beauty of Manchester that I truly love.\u201d \u201cThe challenge for me as a Chinese student is security,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are too many robberies. Rumours are that students from China are particularly targeted by robbers. This might be because of the stereotype that Chinese students are crazy rich.\u201d The university says it is doing all it can to improve student safety with regular police drop-in surgeries, the development of a student neighbourhood watch-style group called \u201cstudent eye\u201d and specific campaigns focussing on international student safety. The university is also developing research to try to find ways to encourage greater integration between Chinese and British students. \u201cStudents from both the UK and China are interested in each other,\u201d says Wang, \u201cbut it looks like they don\u2019t mix much. There is a cultural barrier.\u201d They also live separately. Chinese students are often in more expensive, purpose-built student flats, while British students live in shared houses. And according to Wang, the two groups socialise in completely different ways. \u201cChinese students like doing homework together, having a hotpot at home, singing karaoke, going shopping \u2013 for some, for luxury goods. \u201cBritish students particularly enjoy alcohol in pubs with loud music. I\u2019ve heard complaints from my Chinese friends that they couldn\u2019t make many local friends because they just didn\u2019t like pubs.\u201d Nick Hillman is a governor at Manchester university and director of the Higher Education Policy Institute thinktank. Commenting on the latest Ucas application figures, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that the UK is benefiting from cooler relations between China and the US, and also between China and Australia. We can\u2019t take anything for certain as demand from other countries is very sensitive to all sorts of things but we are clearly gaining advantage at the moment.\u201d",

National Grid predicts that by 2050 millions of electric cars will use wind and solar power to charge up within minutes to act as battery packs for when the grid needs more energy. The grid operator\u2019s long-range energy forecasts predict that smart charging systems will use algorithms to help cars balance demand and supply on the grid, while making the most of renewable energy and saving customers money. It found that the plug-in car fleet could hold a fifth of the electricity produced by the UK\u2019s solar panels, which it predicts will quadruple over the same period. This scenario would make the UK\u2019s ambitious target to cut emissions to net zero by 2050 achievable because it helps cut carbon from the energy and transport sectors, according to the report. Kayte O\u2019Neill, National Grid\u2019s head of strategy, added that electric vehicles will make the energy system more flexible and help bring down costs for consumers too. The forecast is one of five future scenarios envisaged by National Grid to help policymakers and the energy industry shape the future energy mix. In all scenarios the operator predicts electric vehicles will become the most popular form of transport between 2030 and the early 2040s. It also predicts that many more homes and communities will generate their own electricity through solar panels or micro windpower projects. There are fewer than 200,000 electric vehicles on UK roads, meaning the ambitious plug-in car forecast would require a major acceleration of plans for car charging and a step change in customer behaviour. The report said immediate action is required across the electricity, gas, heat and transport sectors \u201cat a significantly greater scale than assumed in any of our core scenarios\u201d if the UK hopes to meet its net-zero target. National Grid\u2019s report also predicts that a net-zero target will require that homes use at least a third less energy for heating than at present and shift away from using natural gas in boilers and radiators. By 2050 at least 7m hybrid heat pumps, which partly rely on renewable energy, should be installed. The UK\u2019s gas system should also be run on hydrogen, rather than typical methane-rich gas to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

      "bodyText": "The failure of the welfare state over the past decade has left families in Britain\u2019s poorest neighbourhoods \u201cblighted by the constant spectre of destitution\u201d and reliant on charity handouts, according to an inquiry by two independent MPs. Heidi Allen and Frank Field said botched social security policies such as universal credit and disability benefit assessments, together with cuts to local services, had fuelled extreme poverty and left the welfare safety net malfunctioning. Massive cuts to the value of benefits in recent years, together with the rise of low-paid and insecure zero-hours work, had put many low-income families at permanent risk of being unable to meet their basic food and housing needs, they said in an interim report. \u201cFor the most vulnerable people in our society, any reduction, delay or loss of income from work or benefits brings into play food banks, rising debt, high-risk loans and the risk of destitution,\u201d Allen said. The report called for changes including scrapping the five week wait for payment of universal credit and lifting a four-year freeze on the level of working-age benefits. The pair are to bring forward a parliamentary bill aimed at tackling insecurity caused by zero-hours work. Some of the harrowing stories cited by the report include a man who sold drugs to feed his younger siblings, and a claimant left with benefits of just \u00a35 a month after being sanctioned. It quoted an advice worker in Chester who told the inquiry: \u201cI don\u2019t meet a single person now who isn\u2019t cold and hungry.\u201d It praised charities for effectively subsidising a depleted social safety net but noted that they were \u201csinking under the weight\u201d of their responsibilities as more people came to them for help. Volunteers were \u201canxious and exhausted with the stress and looming sense of powerlessness,\u201d the report said. It said the UK now had more than 2,000 charity food banks, which were increasingly seen as a normal part of society. Morecambe Bay foodbank, which the inquiry visited in February, gave out three tonnes of food in 2011; by the end of last year it was distributing four tonnes a month. \u201cWhile this community response undoubtedly represents the better nature of human beings, an emergency response adopted by the general public and voluntary organisations must never be confused with a properly functioning welfare safety net,\u201d Field said. The report contrasted charities\u2019 caring approach with the \u201charsh and uncaring\u201d culture too often found in the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and in jobcentres. There was an urgent need to \u201creform the ethos and approach of jobcentres and work coaches so that empathy and compassion are the norm\u201d. Field and Allen, who are respectively chair and vice-chair of the Commons work and pensions select committee, wrote the report after visits to food banks and community groups in London, Leicester, Morecambe, Chester and Glasgow as part of an ongoing project to gauge the changing face of poverty. Allen told the Guardian in January, before she quit the Conservatives, that the idea for the mini-tour of the \u201cother Britain\u201d stemmed from impatience with the party\u2019s complacency over the impact of austerity. \u201cUnless we blow the lid off it [the rise in poverty and destitution], my lot are not going to listen,\u201d she said. Allen resigned from the Conservative party in February to become a founder of the Independent Group, later called Change UK. She left that party in June to sit as an independent. Field, who left the Labour party last year over its handling of antisemitism, has tracked the austerity-era rise in destitution, an extreme form of poverty that is experienced by about 1.5 million people in the UK, according to research. He noted in 2017 that for \u201cthe first time in postwar history, the state has become a generator of destitution\u201d. A DWP spokesperson said: \u201cTackling poverty will always be a priority for this government and we have already said the benefit freeze is coming to an end. But we know some families need more support which is why we spend \u00a395bn a year on working-age benefits and have made 100% universal credit advances available from day one.\u201d",

In 1987 when every household received sombre leaflets warning \u201cdon\u2019t die of ignorance\u201d, nine out of 10 people thought there was something wrong with sexual relations between two adults of the same sex. Every year since, tolerance had increased, but now the British Social Attitudes Survey has found the number of people believing there is nothing wrong with gay sex has fallen, leaving a third of the population in some way opposed. The finding, based on a survey of 2,884 people, coincided with the first dip in more than a decade in people saying they think sex before marriage is not at all wrong, with people from non-Christian religious groups the most likely to disapprove. \u201cLiberalisation of attitudes does seem to be slowing down,\u201d said the independent social research agency NatCen, which carried out the research. \u201cWhile social norms have changed, there is a significant minority of the population who remain uncomfortable with same-sex relationships and as such we may have reached a point of plateau.\u201d The gay rights activist Peter Tatchell said it was \u201ca worrying trend\u201d, while the Christian Institute, an educational charity that believes sex should only happen in a marriage between a man and a woman, said signs of a reversal may be a result of pushback against a \u201cnew orthodoxy that not to celebrate same-sex relations is homophobic\u201d.

      "body": "<p>Gary Cohn, former head of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, says he \u201cvividly\u201d remembers having a conversation in the administration comparing the number of solar-panel installer jobs with the comparatively few coal-mining jobs. <a href=\"http://freakonomics.com/podcast/cohn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">In an interview with the Freakonomics podcast</a>, he says solar is \u201can industry that\u2019s going to continue to grow, and we have to recognise where this country is going, not where this country has been\u201d.</p> <p>The US is not perfectly coherent in its approach to renewables - <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/jan/23/trump-imposes-steep-tariffs-on-imported-solar-panels-and-washing-machines\">in 2018, Trump slapped a 30% tariff on imported solar cells and modules</a> - but New Energy Solar CEO John Martin says it\u2019s well ahead of Australia. \u201cI come back to Australia,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s a peculiar little bubble we\u2019re in here.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike in Australia, the solar energy the US generates is supported by a series of small, grid-connected devices supplying local power, as well as utility-scale solar power plants. In terms of solar gigawatt hour output, globally the US is second only to China.</p> <p>Its commitment to solar is explicit and formalised. \u201cWhere we have a centralised electricity market controlled at a federal level,\u201d Martin says, \u201cin the US, the individual states are really in control and, on the whole, they have implemented energy regime change.\u201d</p> <p>Forty-two states and territories have either renewable portfolio standards or renewable energy goals and the growth is paying dividends. In 2016, 373,000 people were employed in solar, compared to only 86,000 in coal.</p> <p>So, why isn\u2019t Australia keeping pace with the change?</p> <p>We have some of the world\u2019s best conditions for solar energy generation: a dry climate and high levels of solar radiation. Every year, we\u2019re hit with more than 58 million petajoules of solar radiation - about 10,000 times more than our total energy generation output.

Given we contribute a low figure to global emissions \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.environment.gov.au/climate-change/publications/final-report-review-of-climate-change-policies-2017\" rel=\"nofollow\">1.3% in 2017, compared to the US\u2019s 12.9%</a> \u2013 it is easy to argue that the impact of change in Australia would be insignificant. From this point, the debate struggles to progress to a discussion about economic considerations and opportunities.</p> <p>Over time this will change, particularly as bodies such as the CSIRO come out with reports such as its recently released Australian National Outlook 2019, arguing that Australia could achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 while reducing household spend on electricity (relative to incomes) by up to 64%. Importantly, the report\u2019s modelling shows this could be achieved without significant impact on economic growth.</p> <p>In the meantime, as Martin highlights, our relationship with coal is complex. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/29/chinas-policies-put-australias-5bn-coal-export-earnings-at-risk\">Australia is the second-largest exporter of thermal coal in the world</a>. Of course, mining communities, energy companies and investors are reluctant to contemplate change. In addition, the major energy retailers have vested interests to protect, Martin says, in running some of the country\u2019s largest coal-fired power stations. \u201cThey want to keep those stations running as long as possible to maximise their economic return.\u201d</p> <p>More than 80% of electricity is generated from fossil fuels. Increasing solar use means reducing our reliance on coal, and in Australia, that means eventually dismantling a whole industry. Communities would need to be supported through job loss, displacement and disruption. But there are also opportunities. Martin says some of the jobs are transferrable between industries, something he has already seen happen in the US.</p> <p>\u201cRenewables are very labour-intensive in the construction phase,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s potentially two decades of development work in renewables here, so two decades of jobs. Our <a href=\"http://www.firstsolar.com/en-AU/Resources/Projects/Beryl-Solar-Farm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beryl solar farm</a> near Mudgee has just commenced commercial operations and, at the peak of construction, we had 500 people on site. Many of those people came from nearby coalmines.\u201d</p> <p>In Australia\u2019s narrowly focused economy, mining companies and wealthy resource company founders and investors figure large in the debate. A more diverse business base in the US has seen capital and attitudes more readily change direction. In 2018, Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock, which manages more than $6tn in assets, <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" rel=\"nofollow\">wrote to Fortune 500 executives to say he would no longer be recommending companies that weren\u2019t doing social good</a>. This focus on environment, social and governance issues will be the biggest challenge for the major mining houses over the coming decade, says Evy Hambro, chief investment officer in the BlackRock natural resources equity team. The implications of investors\u2019 changing focus are evident in the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund\u2019s increasingly strong stance against oil and gas stocks and in Rio Tinto\u2019s four-step, US$7.68bn retreat from the <a href=\"https://www.afr.com/business/mining/esg-is-top-challenge-for-big-miners-says-blackrock-boss-20190617-p51yd2\" rel=\"nofollow\">coal sector</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe have always been the lucky country,\u201d Martin says. \u201cWe have all these resources in the ground we can dig up and sell. But in the not too distant future, fossil fuel markets are going to slow down. The peak in global coal demand, or \u2018peak coal\u2019, is not far away. As with any industry disruption we need to be prepared for the technological changes that will foster an electricity system powered largely by renewables. We also need to be in a position to give people hope about where income and employment will come from in the future.\u201d</p> <p>The market will move forward, Martin concludes, with or without us. \u201cThe glory days of coal will not last forever.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gary Cohn, former head of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, says he \u201cvividly\u201d remembers having a conversation in the administration comparing the number of solar-panel installer jobs with the comparatively few coal-mining jobs. In an interview with the Freakonomics podcast, he says solar is \u201can industry that\u2019s going to continue to grow, and we have to recognise where this country is going, not where this country has been\u201d. The US is not perfectly coherent in its approach to renewables - in 2018, Trump slapped a 30% tariff on imported solar cells and modules - but New Energy Solar CEO John Martin says it\u2019s well ahead of Australia. \u201cI come back to Australia,\u201d he says, \u201cand it\u2019s a peculiar little bubble we\u2019re in here.\u201d Unlike in Australia, the solar energy the US generates is supported by a series of small, grid-connected devices supplying local power, as well as utility-scale solar power plants. In terms of solar gigawatt hour output, globally the US is second only to China. Its commitment to solar is explicit and formalised. \u201cWhere we have a centralised electricity market controlled at a federal level,\u201d Martin says, \u201cin the US, the individual states are really in control and, on the whole, they have implemented energy regime change.\u201d Forty-two states and territories have either renewable portfolio standards or renewable energy goals and the growth is paying dividends. In 2016, 373,000 people were employed in solar, compared to only 86,000 in coal. So, why isn\u2019t Australia keeping pace with the change? We have some of the world\u2019s best conditions for solar energy generation: a dry climate and high levels of solar radiation. Every year, we\u2019re hit with more than 58 million petajoules of solar radiation - about 10,000 times more than our total energy generation output. But Martin says a complicated relationship with coal and emotive political rhetoric mean we\u2019re not doing as much as we could. The federal government\u2019s position on energy policy has changed many times over. According to Martin, confused messaging and short-term fiscal support for renewable energy does not bode well for improving our power infrastructure and achieving meaningful change. \u201cIn the absence of a clear federal approach, the states are forging their own paths and this will have its own challenges,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the exception of WA, all states and territories have committed to renewable energy targets and/or zero emission targets. Some of the states are far greener than the federal government.\u201d Every year, we\u2019re hit with more than 58 million petajoules of solar radiation \u2013 around 10,000 times more than our total energy generation output. He adds that in his opinion, consumers and corporations \u201cget it\u201d, but the federal government doesn\u2019t, and its approach to the regulatory environment is highly changeable. \u201cThere\u2019s this endless debate about what we should be doing, if anything,\u201d Martin says. \u201cIt has cost many politicians, and prospective politicians, their jobs. It\u2019s become almost a taboo topic. \u201cSpeaking as an investor, the political climate is very influential.

Instead, Mr Acosta brokered a secret plea deal that resulted in a Non-Prosecution Agreement in violation of the Crime Victim\u2019s Rights Act.\u201d His assertion also contradicted an investigation by the Miami Herald over the past two years, which documented unusual contacts between Acosta\u2019s office and Epstein\u2019s defense, and quoted participants in the case as saying that Acosta\u2019s office crumbled under pressure from Epstein\u2019s attorneys. \u201cThis press conference makes me respect Acosta even less than I did before,\u201d tweeted Mimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor in New York. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to blame the state prosecutor, the line attorneys and paint himself as some hero who wanted to be sure Epstein got jail time.\u201d Barbara McQuade, a former US attorney from Michigan, told MSNBC: \u201cI am normally very reluctant to second guess any prosecutor who had to deal with complicated facts \u2026 but I found several areas of [Acosta\u2019s] statement today to be woefully inadequate, including this one where he portrays himself as the hero of the story.\u201d Acosta spoke as Democrats called for his resignation and the House oversight committee requested his testimony at a hearing examining the Epstein plea deal. Republican senators have likewise said they might investigate the deal. Acosta denied that his relationship had soured with the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was reportedly encouraging Trump to cut Acosta loose. Not true, said Acosta, asserting that Mulvaney had called him and told him media reports that Mulvaney opposed him \u201care, in his words, BS\u201d Asked why his office hid the plea deal with Epstein from alleged victims, Acosta said that a provision of the deal under which Epstein had to pay victim restitution could have been used by Epstein\u2019s lawyers, if it were publicly known, to undermine the victims in court by raising questions about their motives. \u201cWe live in a different world; today\u2019s world does not allow some of the victim shaming that would have taken place at trial 12 years ago,\u201d Acosta said. That rationale was vehemently rejected by former prosecutors. \u201cAcosta\u2019s suggestion that his obligation to protect victims was somehow different 12 years ago, because of changing societal attitudes, than it would be today is ridiculous,\u201d tweeted the University of Alabama law professor Joyce Vance. \u201cThe more he defends his conduct the worse he sounds.\u201d Acosta would not say whether he would handle the case differently today. A new alleged victim stepped forward on Wednesday, telling her story on NBC\u2019s Today show. Jennifer Araoz, 32, said Epstein raped her when she was 15. Her lawyers filed court papers on Wednesday as prelude to a lawsuit against Epstein. The papers said that beginning when Araoz was 14, she would give Epstein massages that would often lead to sex acts, the AP reported. Araoz said that after months of massages, Epstein, whose lawyers could not be reached for comment, forcibly raped her in 2002. Pressed on whether he had called the news conference to placate Trump, Acosta said his relationship with the president was \u201coutstanding\u201d but acknowledged that he could be asked to resign at any time. \u201cI serve at the pleasure of the president,\u201d Acosta said.",

Travis gently informed her that it was all very much at the \u201cnormal\u201d end of the spectrum. Sixteen-year-old Olivia\u2019s dad wondered what happened to the notion of \u201cgoing out with someone for three months before you could feel someone\u2019s boobs over their clothes and build up to something consensual \u2026 Do kids miss out on that now?\u201d A question that should have been central was skipped over. There were also some bracing contributions from the porn director Mike Quasar (who ends one of Gia\u2019s scenes by saying: \u201cI\u2019d like to offer you a tissue and an apology\u201d), that at least draw attention to the interrogative void at the heart of the show so far. He notes that the normalisation of porn over the past 10 years has made it a career option for many who wouldn\u2019t previously have considered it. But \u201cI would jump in front of a train if my daughter said she wanted to do porn in any aspect. I am aware that this makes me a massive hypocrite because I\u2019m certainly willing to film other people\u2019s daughters doing terrible things.\u201d I hope the next fortnight considers whether porn was/is/should always be considered a terrible thing or not. Should apologies be made? And to whom, exactly? Can we disaggregate the effects on young women versus young men? Can we come back to Gia and Gianna when they have been in the business three years instead of three months, or talk to those who already have? Are we really all blas\u00e9 about children growing up two clicks away from the kind of images that \u2026 well, click twice and see. They are young, and we are so stupid.",

      "body": "<p>Good morning, this is Helen Sullivan bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 11 July. </p> <h2>Top stories</h2> <p><strong>Relations between the US and UK have been thrown into fresh turmoil</strong> after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/10/kim-darroch-resigns-as-uk-ambassador-to-us-after-leaked-trump-comment\">resignation of Sir Kim Darroch as British ambassador to Washington</a>, as critics of Boris Johnson accused him of throwing the envoy under the bus. In a shock move Darroch announced on Wednesday he could no longer continue in his role following a leak of official cables in which he criticised Donald Trump. He is believed to have concluded he could not go on after he watched Tuesday\u2019s Conservative leadership TV debate, where Johnson repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would sack the ambassador if he became PM. Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week as prime minister, amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment in the hope of pleasing Trump.</p> <p><strong>The Liberal MP Craig Kelly has said he could \u201cactively campaign for the no side\u201d if Ken Wyatt pursues an ambitious proposal for Indigenous constitutional recognition.</strong> Kelly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/11/craig-kelly-says-he-could-campaign-for-the-no-side-on-indigenous-recognition\">told Guardian Australia</a> the government would be better placed working on practical matters, such as addressing high youth suicide rates, rather than contemplating \u201ca separate body with people voting for people based on race\u201d. The Sydney conservative said if Wyatt, the Indigenous affairs minister, wanted to pursue \u201cwords in the constitution that don\u2019t really mean anything, that are symbolic, then that\u2019s fine\u201d. But if the proposal included an idea like the \u201cfirst nations voice\u201d set out in the Uluru statement from the heart, that would be unacceptable to him.</p> <p><strong>The NSW deputy premier has vowed to introduce legislation to open up a national park in the state\u2019s Riverina region to logging.</strong> John Barilaro wants to remove protection of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/11/nsw-deputy-premier-vows-to-open-up-murray-valley-national-park-to-logging\">42,000 hectare Murray Valley national park</a> by either de-gazetting the entire park or reducing its size. The conservation area is known for its river red gum forests and is home to several threatened species and a Ramsar-listed wetland. Whether it takes the form of a private member\u2019s bill or government bill will depend on there being broader Coalition support for reversing the listing of the park. Such a move would be a first for NSW and is fiercely opposed by environment groups.</p> <h2>World</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dc2cccef33d03cd1f54ac333dd0de670888d518\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dc2cccef33d03cd1f54ac333dd0de670888d518/0_56_3955_2373/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labor Secretary Alex Acosta speaks at the Department of Labor, Wednesday, July 10, 2019, in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US labor secretary Alex Acosta wants to cut funds to the agency that combats child sex trafficking.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The US labor secretary, Alex Acosta</strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/labor-secretary-alexander-acosta-sex-trafficking-budget-cut\">has proposed 80% funding cuts</a></strong> <strong>for the government agency that combats child sex trafficking.</strong> Acosta is under fire for having granted Jeffrey Epstein immunity from federal prosecution in 2008 after the billionaire was investigated for having run a child sex-trafficking ring.</p> <p><strong>Angela Merkel has insisted she is in good health after experiencing a third bout of shaking in as many weeks at a public event in Berlin. </strong>\u201cI am doing fine and you should not worry,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/10/angela-merkel-seen-shaking-for-third-time\">she said after the meeting</a>.</p> <p><strong>In three decades\u2019 time, London will have a similar climate to that of Barcelona today, </strong>Madrid will feel like present-day Marrakech by 2050, and Stockholm like Budapest, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jul/10/global-heating-london-similar-climate-barcelona-2050\">according to a report on the likely impacts of the climate crisis</a>.</p> <p><strong>A broken skull chiselled from a lump of rock in a cave in Greece is the oldest modern human fossil found outside Africa, </strong>researchers claim.

Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week as prime minister, amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment in the hope of pleasing Trump. The Liberal MP Craig Kelly has said he could \u201cactively campaign for the no side\u201d if Ken Wyatt pursues an ambitious proposal for Indigenous constitutional recognition. Kelly told Guardian Australia the government would be better placed working on practical matters, such as addressing high youth suicide rates, rather than contemplating \u201ca separate body with people voting for people based on race\u201d. The Sydney conservative said if Wyatt, the Indigenous affairs minister, wanted to pursue \u201cwords in the constitution that don\u2019t really mean anything, that are symbolic, then that\u2019s fine\u201d. But if the proposal included an idea like the \u201cfirst nations voice\u201d set out in the Uluru statement from the heart, that would be unacceptable to him. The NSW deputy premier has vowed to introduce legislation to open up a national park in the state\u2019s Riverina region to logging. John Barilaro wants to remove protection of the 42,000 hectare Murray Valley national park by either de-gazetting the entire park or reducing its size. The conservation area is known for its river red gum forests and is home to several threatened species and a Ramsar-listed wetland. Whether it takes the form of a private member\u2019s bill or government bill will depend on there being broader Coalition support for reversing the listing of the park. Such a move would be a first for NSW and is fiercely opposed by environment groups. World The US labor secretary, Alex Acosta, has proposed 80% funding cuts for the government agency that combats child sex trafficking. Acosta is under fire for having granted Jeffrey Epstein immunity from federal prosecution in 2008 after the billionaire was investigated for having run a child sex-trafficking ring. Angela Merkel has insisted she is in good health after experiencing a third bout of shaking in as many weeks at a public event in Berlin. \u201cI am doing fine and you should not worry,\u201d she said after the meeting. In three decades\u2019 time, London will have a similar climate to that of Barcelona today, Madrid will feel like present-day Marrakech by 2050, and Stockholm like Budapest, according to a report on the likely impacts of the climate crisis. A broken skull chiselled from a lump of rock in a cave in Greece is the oldest modern human fossil found outside Africa, researchers claim. If the claim is verified, the finding will rewrite a key chapter of the human story. A Spanish court has ruled that pop star Julio Iglesias is the biological father of a 42-year-old man whose mother said she had a brief affair with the singer in the 1970s. In a case that has dragged on for two years, a judge made the ruling despite Iglesias repeatedly refusing to give a DNA sample. Opinion and analysis Australia could quickly solve the problem of Indonesia and other countries rejecting its waste if governments invested in manufacturing of recycled-content products and required public servants to use them, industry and environmental groups say. Jakarta announced on Tuesday it would return 210 tonnes of Australian household rubbish in the latest demonstration of opposition in south-east Asia to receiving exported waste. Peter Shmigel, the head of the Australian Council of Recycling, which represents about 70 companies, said one major project could be enough to make a difference to the industry. \u201cIf the federal government decided tomorrow that the 27km of roads and tunnels required for Snowy Hydro 2.0 was to be built out of recycled products you wouldn\u2019t have an export problem,\u201d he said. Now that the Australian federal election has been won, suddenly employer groups and the government are talking up the need for industrial relations \u201creform\u201d, writes Greg Jericho. \u201cIt is a push that, inevitably, is for more flexibility. But as the latest annual data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force participation, mobility and job search reveals, this increased flexibility is a major driver of the current historically high levels of underemployment and the associated low wages growth.\u201d Sport NSW swept in with 32 seconds left to settle a thrilling State of Origin finale in Sydney. After 80 minutes of high emotion, intense action and huge momentum shifts, a last-minute try by James Tedesco took NSW to a 26-20 win over Queensland, and with it the 2019 series. New Zealand are in the final of the cricket World Cup after sensationally dismissing India for 221 when their rain-delayed semi-final resumed at Old Trafford. India\u2019s top three were all dismissed for a single run each, reducing them to 24-4 chasing 240 to win. Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni fought back, but a brilliant runout by Martin Guptill sent the delirious Kiwis through. Thinking time: Inside Egypt\u2019s dream to conquer the desert Seen from space, Egypt is a vast dusty land with a green Y opening into the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 a fertile valley that makes up 5% of the country but is home to 95% of the population. This pattern of human occupation had characterised the country for thousands of years, but in the 1970s, as ever more precious green land was eaten up by urban growth, an idea that had been taking shape in the national consciousness for decades was finally put into action. Egypt would \u201cconquer the desert\u201d and redistribute its burgeoning population across the white sands of the Sahara \u2013 an Egyptian version of the 19th-century US \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d to move west, no matter how punishing the consequences. With Cairo bursting at the seams, plans were drawn up for satellite cities to take the strain. After many failed attempts, 10th of Ramadan \u2013 a blue-collar industrial city \u2013 was the first experimental new city to take shape in the 1970s. For four decades the new cities program has remained the only vehicle for Egypt\u2019s urban development. Today there are 22 built or part-built Egyptian new cities \u2013 and the New Urban Communities Authority has plans for 19 more. About 7 million people now call these new cities home. It is arguably the most ambitious new cities program the world has ever seen \u2013 a dream of bustling cities in an almost lunar desert landscape that outstrips the visions of even China and India.

      "bodyText": "Eleven years since Rafael Nadal\u2019s victory against Roger Federer at Wimbledon in what is widely accepted to be the greatest match in history, the pair will renew rivalries again after the Spaniard swept aside Sam Querrey in the quarter-finals. For all that the failure of the young pretenders to challenge the Big Three has been lamented, it has its upsides too given Nadal and Federer have not clashed in SW19 since that unforgettable tussle in 2008. The men\u2019s competition has been a slow burner, to put it politely, but Nadal\u2019s semi-final against Federer will ensure it catches fire on Friday. Nadal has seemingly played with a chip on his shoulder, so perhaps it will please him to hear that Querrey \u2013 no mug on these courts having defeated Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic in recent years \u2013 has tipped Federer for victory. Nadal was piqued by Nick Kyrgios\u2019s verbal jousting and sent him packing and after brushing aside Jo\u00e3o Sousa in the previous round Nadal was adamant he deserved his place on Centre Court when put to him that perhaps the women\u2019s world No 1, Ashleigh Barty, ought to have been there instead. Querrey certainly posed a dangerous threat, coming into the match top of the aces list with 100 and having been broken just once. Nadal also has history when it comes to less heralded opponents producing inspired performances against him with Gilles M\u00fcller, Dustin Brown, Kyrgios, Steve Darcis and Luka Rosol all beating him since his second title in 2010. That said, Nadal has arguably not been in this kind of form at Wimbledon since then. If he is to add a third title he is likely to have to overcome Federer and the defending champion Novak Djokovic \u2013 who beat him in the last four a year ago \u2013 but the Spaniard has the added carrot of what would be a third French Open and Wimbledon double. Assuming Djokovic will reach the final is not to do Roberto Bautista Agut a disservice but the world No 1 is looking equally formidable. This is the first time the Big Three have all reached the last four since 2007 but the writing has been on the wall since the early rounds. \u201cFirst of all, it\u2019s a great feeling to be back in that semi-finals,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cI\u2019m very happy the way we managed to be in that round.

I am sorry Ms Campbell doesn\u2019t share these same views, but my decision was out of respect of my wife, character, and our Christian faith. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind granting Ms Campbell an interview. We just want it to be in an appropriate and professional setting that wouldn\u2019t provide opportunities for us to be alone.\u201d",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Konta consternation </strong></h2> <p>It may have been men\u2019s quarter\u2011finals day but the hot topic was still Johanna Konta. The British No 1 had claimed she was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/09/johanna-konta-barbora-strycova-wimbledon-quarter-final\" title=\"\">patronised by a journalist</a> following her quarter-final defeat by Barbora Strycova and their press conference exchange went viral. The next day it appeared there were roughly two camps on the affair. The first were those who said the questioning was harsh but fair, that Konta has crumbled in the past and is reluctant to admit to it or explain why. The second were those who felt that, while her game may not be perfect and her attitude towards the media consistently stony, the questions \u2013 which suggested she \u201ccould have done better\u201d and might \u201chave to have a look at herself\u201d \u2013 were not appropriate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/10/roger-federer-wimbledon-century-rafael-nadal-kei-nishikori\">Roger Federer brings up Wimbledon century with Rafael Nadal next in line</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Roughly speaking, athletes and fellow pros appeared to be of the latter position. Marion Bartoli gave an extensive interview on the topic and suggested Konta had been \u201cbullied\u201d. Meanwhile, at a press conference to tee up the Open, Rory McIlroy chipped in to agree Konta had been patronised and that \u201cmedia expectations often exceed players\u2019\u201d. Finally, when approached by the Diary while dashing to the referees\u2019 office, Tim Henman suggested the entire line of questioning was redundant. \u201cWhen you give 100% on the court, how can you be expected to give any more?\u201d he said. So that\u2019s where we are at the end of day two. It is anticipated that an antagonistic relationship between the media and the sportsmen and women they report on may continue for a while.</p> <h2><strong>Hats off to Navratilova </strong></h2> <p>Giving no hoots this Wimbledon is Martina Navratilova. During the invitational doubles on Tuesday eagle-eyed officials spotted she was wearing a baseball cap bearing the legend \u201cimpeach\u201d and was told to take it off.

      "bodyText": "Konta consternation It may have been men\u2019s quarter\u2011finals day but the hot topic was still Johanna Konta. The British No 1 had claimed she was patronised by a journalist following her quarter-final defeat by Barbora Strycova and their press conference exchange went viral. The next day it appeared there were roughly two camps on the affair. The first were those who said the questioning was harsh but fair, that Konta has crumbled in the past and is reluctant to admit to it or explain why. The second were those who felt that, while her game may not be perfect and her attitude towards the media consistently stony, the questions \u2013 which suggested she \u201ccould have done better\u201d and might \u201chave to have a look at herself\u201d \u2013 were not appropriate. Roughly speaking, athletes and fellow pros appeared to be of the latter position. Marion Bartoli gave an extensive interview on the topic and suggested Konta had been \u201cbullied\u201d. Meanwhile, at a press conference to tee up the Open, Rory McIlroy chipped in to agree Konta had been patronised and that \u201cmedia expectations often exceed players\u2019\u201d. Finally, when approached by the Diary while dashing to the referees\u2019 office, Tim Henman suggested the entire line of questioning was redundant. \u201cWhen you give 100% on the court, how can you be expected to give any more?\u201d he said. So that\u2019s where we are at the end of day two. It is anticipated that an antagonistic relationship between the media and the sportsmen and women they report on may continue for a while. Hats off to Navratilova Giving no hoots this Wimbledon is Martina Navratilova. During the invitational doubles on Tuesday eagle-eyed officials spotted she was wearing a baseball cap bearing the legend \u201cimpeach\u201d and was told to take it off.

      "body": "<p>Boris Johnson is under pressure over his role in Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation as British ambassador to Washington, with critics accusing the likely next prime minister of throwing the envoy \u201cunder the bus\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a shock move which prompted the senior civil servant at the Foreign Office to call an all-staff meeting to reassure \u201cshaken\u201d diplomats, Darroch announced on Wednesday he could no longer continue in his role following a leak of official cables in which he criticised Donald Trump.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that he concluded he could not go on after he watched Tuesday\u2019s Conservative leadership TV debate, where Johnson repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would sack the ambassador if he became PM.</p> \n<p>Downing Street is so uncomfortable with the outcome that Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week as prime minister. That would upend protocol amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment in the hope of pleasing Trump.</p> \n<p>A broad political consensus has emerged that Johnson\u2019s refusal to back Darroch had made the diplomat\u2019s position untenable. Senior Conservative MPs joined the direct criticism of the leadership contender, describing his conduct as \u201cunedifying\u201d and \u201ccontemptible\u201d. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, asked: \u201cIf you do not support those you put into very difficult positions, what do you think is going to happen?\u201d</p> \n<p>In language that will be viewed as an implicit rebuke of Johnson, Theresa May told MPs: \u201cI hope the house will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure.\u201d</p> \n<p>It is understood that Johnson, who worked with Darroch as foreign secretary, later spoke to the departing ambassador to express his \u201cregret\u201d at the fact he had resigned. Asked why he had not been more supportive of Darroch he insisted he had backed him and said it was \u201cwrong to drag civil servants into the public arena\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad970db7-a264-49a0-b977-2afa8dfc76ff\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2SGSZ0mTJb8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Meanwhile, a renewed focus also fell on the identity of the leaker, with Foreign Office permanent under-secretary Simon McDonald telling MPs: \u201cWe will pursue the culprit with all the means at our disposal. The leaker is guilty of the worst breach of trust in our service in my career.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked whether the entire establishment would be expected to support Darroch in such an episode, he said that the Foreign Office had noted with gratitude the support given to Darroch by the prime minister and the foreign secretary. He made no mention of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/boris-johnson\">Johnson</a>.</p> \n<p>While the ambassador\u2019s decision to resign brought the immediate crisis to an end, it sparked a new round of recrimination and investigation in the UK and fears that the transatlantic diplomatic calculus could have permanently shifted, as:</p> \n<p>\u2022 No 10 said that discussions had begun with police over an investigation into the source of the leak.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Amid fears of more leaks, the foreign affairs select committee heard that inquiries would focus on a set of highly sensitive emails sent to as few as five or 10 people.</p> \n<p>\u2022 President Trump did not immediately add to his previous comments on the situation, but one senior US official said that the move was \u201cprobably the right course\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u2022 US-UK relations appeared further strained by the developments as McDonald warned: \u201cThere must be consequences.\u201d</p> \n<p>Darroch will stay in the role until a new ambassador is appointed \u2013 which could be imminently if May makes the controversial decision to pre-empt her successor. A government source said \u201cdiscussions are live\u201d and that she was expected to come to a decision within 24 hours.</p> \n<p>As well as concerns over the nature of a Johnson appointment, there are worries that such a crucial vacancy should not be left unfilled.</p> \n<p>McDonald told the foreign affairs select committee that he had been forced to call the all-staff meeting to reassure concerned diplomats and he feared that further illegal leaks could be in the offing.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are shaken by what has happened and there is a reason why I have asked to see all my colleagues,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe basis on which we have worked all our careers suddenly feels challenged.\u201d He described the episode as a personal tragedy for Darroch.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"709068e9-7a3a-4d02-9d06-c7d78307fbbb\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vx7ZO-hvxgE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, attacked Johnson\u2019s role in the affair.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor someone who wants to lead, let alone unite, the country, that was contemptible negligence on his part,\u201d Duncan told the BBC. \u201cHe has basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under the bus to serve his own personal interests.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Conservative MP Sir Patrick McLoughlin agreed, saying: \u201cIt is unedifying to see someone who wants to be prime minister failing to stand up for hard-working civil servants, who have done nothing wrong, under attack from foreign governments.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson is under pressure over his role in Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation as British ambassador to Washington, with critics accusing the likely next prime minister of throwing the envoy \u201cunder the bus\u201d. In a shock move which prompted the senior civil servant at the Foreign Office to call an all-staff meeting to reassure \u201cshaken\u201d diplomats, Darroch announced on Wednesday he could no longer continue in his role following a leak of official cables in which he criticised Donald Trump. The Guardian understands that he concluded he could not go on after he watched Tuesday\u2019s Conservative leadership TV debate, where Johnson repeatedly dodged questions about whether he would sack the ambassador if he became PM. Downing Street is so uncomfortable with the outcome that Theresa May is understood to be considering appointing a new ambassador in her last week as prime minister. That would upend protocol amid concerns Johnson could seek to make a controversial political appointment in the hope of pleasing Trump. A broad political consensus has emerged that Johnson\u2019s refusal to back Darroch had made the diplomat\u2019s position untenable. Senior Conservative MPs joined the direct criticism of the leadership contender, describing his conduct as \u201cunedifying\u201d and \u201ccontemptible\u201d. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, asked: \u201cIf you do not support those you put into very difficult positions, what do you think is going to happen?\u201d In language that will be viewed as an implicit rebuke of Johnson, Theresa May told MPs: \u201cI hope the house will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure.\u201d It is understood that Johnson, who worked with Darroch as foreign secretary, later spoke to the departing ambassador to express his \u201cregret\u201d at the fact he had resigned. Asked why he had not been more supportive of Darroch he insisted he had backed him and said it was \u201cwrong to drag civil servants into the public arena\u201d. Meanwhile, a renewed focus also fell on the identity of the leaker, with Foreign Office permanent under-secretary Simon McDonald telling MPs: \u201cWe will pursue the culprit with all the means at our disposal. The leaker is guilty of the worst breach of trust in our service in my career.\u201d Asked whether the entire establishment would be expected to support Darroch in such an episode, he said that the Foreign Office had noted with gratitude the support given to Darroch by the prime minister and the foreign secretary. He made no mention of Johnson. While the ambassador\u2019s decision to resign brought the immediate crisis to an end, it sparked a new round of recrimination and investigation in the UK and fears that the transatlantic diplomatic calculus could have permanently shifted, as: \u2022 No 10 said that discussions had begun with police over an investigation into the source of the leak. \u2022 Amid fears of more leaks, the foreign affairs select committee heard that inquiries would focus on a set of highly sensitive emails sent to as few as five or 10 people. \u2022 President Trump did not immediately add to his previous comments on the situation, but one senior US official said that the move was \u201cprobably the right course\u201d. \u2022 US-UK relations appeared further strained by the developments as McDonald warned: \u201cThere must be consequences.\u201d Darroch will stay in the role until a new ambassador is appointed \u2013 which could be imminently if May makes the controversial decision to pre-empt her successor. A government source said \u201cdiscussions are live\u201d and that she was expected to come to a decision within 24 hours. As well as concerns over the nature of a Johnson appointment, there are worries that such a crucial vacancy should not be left unfilled. McDonald told the foreign affairs select committee that he had been forced to call the all-staff meeting to reassure concerned diplomats and he feared that further illegal leaks could be in the offing. \u201cPeople are shaken by what has happened and there is a reason why I have asked to see all my colleagues,\u201d McDonald said. \u201cThe basis on which we have worked all our careers suddenly feels challenged.\u201d He described the episode as a personal tragedy for Darroch. Sir Alan Duncan, a Foreign Office minister, attacked Johnson\u2019s role in the affair. \u201cFor someone who wants to lead, let alone unite, the country, that was contemptible negligence on his part,\u201d Duncan told the BBC. \u201cHe has basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under the bus to serve his own personal interests.\u201d The Conservative MP Sir Patrick McLoughlin agreed, saying: \u201cIt is unedifying to see someone who wants to be prime minister failing to stand up for hard-working civil servants, who have done nothing wrong, under attack from foreign governments. Leadership involves standing up for your team.\u201d And the former Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt said: \u201cAnyone, I think, would have seen last night\u2019s events and seen a potential prime minister letting someone go very publicly.\u201d Replying to Darroch\u2019s letter of resignation, in which he said that speculation was \u201cmaking it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like\u201d, McDonald said Darroch had been the target of \u201ca malicious leak\u201d and expressed gratitude for his work. \u201cYou are the best of us,\u201d he wrote. May told the House of Commons she had told Darroch it was \u201ca matter of great regret that he has felt it necessary to leave his position\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn called the treatment of Darroch \u201cbeyond unfair and wrong\u201d and said he had given \u201chonourable and good service\u201d. The criticism of Johnson was based on his choice of language in Tuesday night\u2019s Conservative leadership debate, in which he refused to give Darroch his support, even as his leadership rival, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he would expect the ambassador to stay in post until his planned retirement. Hunt said in a statement that he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the outcome, adding: \u201cI am outraged that a selection of his reports should have been leaked.\u201d At the foreign affairs committee hearing, McDonald said that there had been a great deal of soul-searching about the leak and added that he knew of no precedent where a friendly power had refused to cooperate with a serving British ambassador. Asked what the impact would be for transatlantic relations he said: \u201cIt is too soon to have a complete or authoritative judgment. Nothing like this has ever happened. There must be consequences.\u201d He later insisted the special relationship was so deep and so wide that it could survive any individual squall. There was no immediate comment from Trump, but the vice-president, Mike Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, said that the move was \u201cprobably the right course\u201d. A state department spokeswoman said: \u201cThe United States and the United Kingdom share a bond that is bigger than any individual, and we look forward to continuing that partnership. We remain committed to the US-UK special relationship and our shared global agenda.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Gatwick airport suspended all inbound and outbound flights for around two hours on Wednesday due to an \u201cair traffic control system issue\u201d. Eight flights into Gatwick, in West Sussex, were cancelled and 26 diverted before operations resumed at 7.10pm and passengers were warned there would be further delays into the evening, with the airport advising them to check with their airlines. Travellers in Gothenburg, Bilbao, Bergen and elsewhere had to reschedule their plans, while planes from a number of European cities including Montpellier, Krak\u00f3w, and Paphos were diverted elsewhere, mainly to Stansted and Luton airports. Flights were suspended just after 5pm, although a small number of flights were allowed to land after the suspension began. The UK\u2019s second busiest airport had released a statement on Twitter saying it was \u201cworking with ANS [Air Navigation Systems], our provider, to rectify this issue as quickly as possible\u201d. It apologised and advised passengers to contact airlines to check their flight information. After flights started again at 7.10pm, an airport spokesman said: \u201cFlights have resumed at Gatwick following an earlier issue with the systems operated by ANS in our air traffic control tower. As we move back into full operations, we are likely to see some delays and further cancellations this evening. \u201cWe apologise to passengers who have been affected and are aiming to operate a full schedule of flights tomorrow. We continue to advise all passengers travelling tonight or tomorrow to check the status of their flight with their airline before travelling to the airport.\u201d European air safety organisation Eurocontrol said a technical issue meant arrivals and departures information would be unavailable until 9pm, while the exact nature of the issue in the airport\u2019s control tower that triggered the suspension remained unclear. EasyJet said on its website: \u201cThe disruption to your flight is beyond our control and is considered an extraordinary circumstance. Whilst outside of our control, we apologise for the inconvenience this may cause to your journey.\u201d Passengers affected by the disruption were warned by an independent expert that they were unlikely to be compensated by their airline because the delays were caused by the air traffic control system. However, delays or cancelled flights could be covered by travel insurance. It follows the cancellation of more than 1,000 flights at the airport over three days last December, affecting more than 140,000 passengers, after repeated drone sightings forced it to close the runway. Earlier this month, a senior Sussex police officer said Gatwick\u2019s defences against a similar incident were \u201cnow fit for purpose\u201d, and that its \u201cdrone plan\u201d had been based \u201caround a single drone incursion and not a multiple one\u201d. \u201cWe have now got the mitigation technology in place, I wish we had that in December,\u201d Sussex police\u2019s Supt Justin Burtenshaw said.",

Sir Kim is blameless in this sorry affair.\u201d Darroch submitted his resignation on Wednesday, three days after his private assessments of the Trump administration were leaked to the Mail on Sunday.

Stefanos Tsitisipas, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and all the rest need to take a long hard look at themselves. But it\u2019s not just the so-called Next Gen struggling to take a giant leap at the grand slams. It\u2019s also the generation who spent years trying to break the dominance of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic \u2013 your Marins, your Grigors, your Jo-Wilfrieds. With Andy Murray chopped down by that pesky hip, Stan Wawrinka struggling to get over a knee injury and Juan Martin del Potro developing a well-earned reputation as the world\u2019s unluckiest man, it\u2019s been a barren landscape beyond the big three over the past few years and that hasn\u2019t changed over the past fortnight.</p> <p>The fourth round was a particular lowlight. Manic Monday was just a bit meh, with Djokovic cruising past Ugo Humbert (world No who cares), Nadal devouring Joao Sousa (world No look it up yourself) and Federer taking three seconds to see off Matteo Berrettini (world No it really doesn\u2019t matter). And it might not get much better in today\u2019s quarter-finals. For Djokovic, it\u2019s a match against David Goffin in the opener on Centre Court - he\u2019s won five of his six encounters with the 21st seed. For Nadal, it\u2019s a tussle with big-serving Sam Querrey \u2013 the No 3 seed will need to be careful against the big-serving American, who has beaten Murray and Djokovic here in the past, but he leads their head-to-head 4-1. And Federer, gliding along in regal fashion, faces Kei Nishikori \u2013 he leads 7-3 in his head-to-head with the eighth seed, who is making a habit of coming unstuck in the last eight of grand slams.</p> <p>In other news Roberto Bautista Agut, the 23rd seed, faces Guido Pella, the 26th seed. Bautista Agut is 31 and had never reached a grand slam quarter-final until this year\u2019s Australian Open. Pella is 29 and has never made it this far before.</p> <p>Hmmm. It has the air of predictability about it. On half of the draw Federer and Nadal will expect to secure the wins that will see them meet for the first time here since the 2008 final. On the other it\u2019s difficult to see anyone stopping Djokovic from reaching the final. And at this rate you\u2019re almost left wondering if tennis shouldn\u2019t just replace the grand slams with a Federer-Nadal-Djokovic Super League; just them playing each on a round robin basis for two weeks four times year. I reckon the crowds would lap it up. It\u2019s a good idea. I am willing to be paid a lot of money to make it a reality. </p> <p><strong>Play begins at:</strong> 1pm BST.</p> </div>   </div>",

      "bodyText": "Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal will meet for the 40th time on Friday - and for the fourth time at Wimbledon. They haven\u2019t been since on Centre Court together since the 2008 final, which was won by Nadal. It should be epic. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s epic. In the other semi-final, meanwhile, Roberto Bautista Agut will hope to upset Novak Djokovic. It will be a tall order for the popular Spaniard. All eyes on Federer and Nadal, though. Not least because Andy Murray and Serena Williams are out of the mixed doubles after their defeat to Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar today. Bah. That\u2019s all from me. Thanks for reading. Bye. Rafael Nadal speaks! \u201cI had to work. I am very pleased. It is difficult to imagine to be again in that situation but here we are. Of course I am excited to play against Roger again at Wimbledon after such a long time.\u201d Nadal seals it with a forehand. Of course. He\u2019s through to face none other than Roger Federer in the last four - for the first time here since the 2008 final! It\u2019s 7-5, 6-2, 5-1 to Rafael Nadal on Court 1. He\u2019s a game from a semi-final with Roger Federer. Rafael Nadal rumbles on towards the inevitable. He leads Sam Querrey 7-5, 6-2, 3-1. Roger Federer speaks after his 100th singles match win at Wimbledon. \u201cIt was difficult. The beginning was brutal. Kei came out smashing return winners and I had to make adjustments. Kei was the better player and it was important for me to compete in the second. I just think in the end I served really good. We have a lot of information on Rafa and so does he on us. You can dive into tactics or you can say it\u2019s good for tennis. I\u2019d love to play him against him again at Wimbledon.\u201d The early crisis is forgotten. The second seed has fought back from a set down to beat the eighth seed and reach a likely semi-final against Rafa Nadal. A good performance from Federer in the end, though he\u2019ll probably need to raise his level against Nadal. The second set was easier. Kei Nishikori lifts a forehand long and Roger Federer breaks! The Swiss will serve for the match at 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 5-4. Kei Nishikori has dug in during the fourth set. He holds for 4-3. Roger Federer is being made to wait. A break for Rafa Nadal early in the second set on Court 1. He leads Sam Querrey 7-5, 2-1 and it might not be long before he\u2019s being asked about his thoughts on the flowers here. Novak Djokovic faced some fierce questioning in his press conference. Q. You\u2019ve been coming to Wimbledon a long time, go deep here. Have you had a chance to notice how many nice flowers there are here? NOVAK DJOKOVIC: They\u2019re beautiful, yeah. I actually like early hours of the day before the public and the crowd comes in. That\u2019s when you can actually move around freely as a player. That\u2019s where you notice how much effort and time people who are working in organisation, management here, you know, how much time and efforts they\u2019re investing into making this club probably the most famous tennis club in the world. One more set for Federer, two more for Nadal and they meet on Friday. What a delicious thought. At least they\u2019re both having to work a bit today. Again Nadal falls into a 0-30 deficit. Doesn\u2019t this Querrey guy knows his place? It seems not. Nadal fights back to 30-all, but then he gives the American a break point with an errant forehand. His response? An ace down the middle, Querrey swiping at thin air. But Nadal\u2019s wobbling a little and faces another break point after knocking a backhand long. He saves it with a forehand off a good serve - but Querrey causes damage with a forehand and earns another chance. Yet Nadal slashes an ace down the middle. Eventually he has set point - and after an almighty brawl he\u2019s mightily grateful to see Querrey spoon a forehand return wide. That took 58 minutes to get done. Federer saves a break point, volleys brilliantly to earn a set point and wastes it with a wild drive volley. Soon he has another chance, though, and he takes this one with the minimum fuss. Rafa Nadal roars! He\u2019s broken Sam Querrey to lead 6-5 and will serve for the set again. To Court 1, where Nadal is serving for the set. Down 0-30, he plays a couple of magnificent points to make it 30-all. He attacks with his forehand and volleys authoritatively for a set point. Yet Querrey saves it with some big hitting, just doing enough with a smash to force deuce. He\u2019s making Nadal work hard. He earns a break point when he goes behind Nadal with a forehand. And he comes up with a stonking backhand return that forces Nadal to hook a forehand wide! Querrey, having saved three set points, breaks for 5-5! Great returning from Federer brings up two break points in the seventh game of the third set on Centre Court. A 19-shot rally ends with Federer knocking a forehand long. Then Nishikori cracks an ace out wide to force deuce. But then he nets a backhand. Another break point for Federer. But Nishikori serves well again to save it. It\u2019s deuce for while - until Federer sprays a backhand down the line for a fourth chance. And this time Federer finds the line with a deep, killing forehand. He breaks to lead 4-6, 6-1, 4-3. Great returning from Federer brings up two break points in the seventh game of the third set on Centre Court. A 19-shot rally ends with Federer knocking a forehand long. Then Nishikori cracks an ace out wide to force deuce. A wonderful volley from Sam Querrey a break point on Court 1. But Nadal saves it, serving wide enough to force Querrey to knock a backhand long. They stay at deuce for a while, but Nadal holds to lead 5-3. Kei Nishikori has steadied the ship at the start of the third set, holding to lead 2-1. Meanwhile Rafael Nadal remains a break up against Sam Querrey in the first set on Court 1. The Spaniard\u2019s serving has been outstanding. A whipcrack forehand from left to right is enough for Rafael Nadal to earn a swift break against Sam Querrey. The American pays for an approach to the net. He was asking to be passed and Nadal obliged. Nadal leads 2-1 already. You can hear the crowd\u2019s relief on Centre Court. I don\u2019t think they want Kei Nishikori to win this match! A vicious backhand return from Federer forces Nishikori to hook a backhand wide and drop his serve again. It\u2019s taken 19 minutes for Federer to lead 5-1 in the second set. The Swiss will serve to level the match after breaking again. The Federer serve has clicked into gear in the second set. He holds easily. Kei Nishikori leads 6-4, 1-4. Rafael Nadal and Sam Querrey arrive on Court 1. Can Big Sam\u2019s big serve get the job done against the third seed? Probably not! But he has done it against Djokovic and Murray here. It could be awkward for Nadal. Might the tide be turning on Centre Court? Roger Federer wallops a forehand down the line, breaks to love and leads 2-0 in the second set against Kei Nishikori. Serving for the set, Nishikori begins by running around a forehand and slamming it down the line. Federer\u2019s reply goes long. Then Nishikori serves and volleys for 30-0. He lets it go to 30-all but a delightful touch at the net earns him a set point. And a big, deep forehand into the left corner gives the eighth seed the set! They aren\u2019t very happy on Centre Court. Over to Centre Court, where Kei Nishikori continues to make the most of that early break, holding to lead 5-3 against Roger Federer. Nishikori\u2019s using a lot of serve-volley. Pella sends a backhand long and Bautista Agut is into his first grand slam semi-final! He\u2019s absolutely delighted! He plays Djokovic on Friday and has only dropped one set so far. Party: pooped. The top seeds were too good. It\u2019s all over when Murray slaps a forehand return into the net off a Melichar serve. Team SerAndy are out. They don\u2019t look too downhearted, though. Now let us never speak of mixed doubles again! Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar hold to lead SerAndy 6-3, 4-6, 5-1 on Court 2. The fun is all but over. Roberto Bautista Agut is closing in on victory against Guido Pella. The Spaniard has broken in the fourth set and leads 7-4, 6-4, 3-6, 3-1. Roger Federer\u2019s being given the runaround by Kei Nishikori! A poor forehand from th Swiss hands Nishikori three break points and a chance for a double break. Federer comes up with an answer, though, winning three straight points for deuce. He holds with an ace to trail 1-2. He appears to have woken up. Now Serena Williams has been broken. Oh dear. It\u2019s all going wrong for SerAndy. A sharp volley from Bruno Soares is enough for the top seeds to lead 6-3, 4-6, 3-0. Andy Murray\u2019s broken in the first game of the third set on Court 2. Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar lead 1-0 in the decider. And get this - on Centre Court Kei Nishikori has pounced at the net and broken to 15 to lead 1-0 at the start of his quarter-final against Roger Federer! Tok! Tok! Tok! Roger Federer and Kei Nishikori are knocking up on Centre Court. Serving to stay in the set, Bruno Soares surprisingly makes two double-faults to hand SerAndy three set points. Soares smashes to save the first. Then he double-faults again! What a meltdown from the Brazilian! The match goes to a deciding third set. SerAndy hold to 15 to lead 5-4 in the second set. Bruno Soares will serve to keep the impressive top seeds in the set. Roger Federer and Kei Nishikori stride out on to Centre Court. They\u2019ll begin soon. The 26th seed came back from two sets down to beat Marin Cilic last year and Milos Raonic two days ago - and he\u2019s threatening to do it against Roberto Bautista Agut on Court 1. On Court 2 Serena Williams comes through a tricky service game in the second set. SerAndy hold for 4-3, but they remain a set down to Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar. I just spent 20 minutes trying to get the wifi to work on Centre Court well enough for me to stay there for Roger Federer versus Kei Nishikori. And where am I now? Back in the media centre. Murray dumps a backhand volley into the net and Team SerAndy are in trouble on Court 2! A ripsnorting backhand return from Bruno Soares earns the top seeds the first break on Court 2. Serena Williams is broken. Soares will serve for the first set at 5-3. The Guido Pella comeback begins here. The Argentinian loves a fightback from two sets down at Wimbledon and he\u2019s broken early in the third set against Roberto Bautista Agut, who leads 7-5, 6-4, 0-3 on Court 1. A mismatch. Serving to stay in the match, sort of, Goffin decides he can\u2019t take any more punishment and sends a final backhand wide to end it once and for all. Djokovic is through to the last four and he\u2019s barely had to break into a set. Serena Williams is playing some astonishing tennis over on Court 2. Andy Murray is also there. Another comfortable hold for Djokovic, who leads Goffin 6-4, 6-0, 5-2. That one\u2019s almost done/ The Spaniard is in command against Guido Pella and he\u2019s motoring towards a semi-final against Novak Djokovic. Venus Williams is in the crowd on Court 2 and she\u2019s brought a selfie stick with her. \u201cWatching Federer, Djokovic and Nadal, it\u2019s incredible to see the gulf in class between them and almost anyone else, but they also just seem to have a complete mental stranglehold over almost everyone else,\u201d Matt Dony says. \u201cObviously, they\u2019ve earned their auras through years of consistent brilliance, but it\u2019s got to the point where, in the big tournaments, they often seem to walk on to the court already a set up against their opponents. Watching them play brilliant tennis is great. Watching other players wilt in the face of their brilliant tennis, however, is less entertaining.\u201d Novak Djokovic does another break and leads 6-4, 6-0, 3-1. Roger Federer and Kei Nishikori can start getting ready. On Court 2, meanwhile, Nicole Melichar is hitting some really good lobs. She holds for 2-1 against SerAndy. It\u2019s been a good start on Court 2. Sharp play at the net from Serena Williams is enough for Andy Murray to hold for 1-1 in the mixed doubles. Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar are tough opponents. Djokovic saves a break point and holds to lead 6-4, 6-0, 1-0. On Court 1 Roberto Bautista Agut leads 7-5, 4-2 against Guido Pella, who probably doesn\u2019t want to play Djokovic on Friday. Andy Murray and Serena Williams - SerAndy, Murrena - are on Court 2. They play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar soon. The second set is over in 32 minutes. \u201cWhat your Super League needs is mascots that represent each player,\u201d Gregory Phillips says. \u201cFederer\u2019s could be a panther or some other kind of jungle cat, all graceful movement and coiled power. Nadal would be a bull. Djokovic I\u2019m less sure of. Maybe an android, engineered to be the perfect tennis machine, yet prone to occasional programming glitches?\u201d Goffin balloons a forehand and Djokovic breaks to love and Djokovic leads 6-4, 4-0 and this is a grand slam quarter-final and please tell me what I\u2019m meant to say about this. Novak Djokovic has broken early in the second set. He leads 6-4, 2-0. My Federer-Nadal-Djokovic Super League idea is becoming more and more attractive. The consistent Spaniard is two sets from his first grand slam semi-final! Guido Pella nets a backhand and Roberto Bautista Agut breaks for a 6-5 lead on Court 1. The Spaniard will serve for the set. David Goffin hangs his head after sending a backhand wide at 15-40. Ah well. As expected Djokovic raised his game at the crucial moment and responded well to going down an early break. He won three straight games to take the set. Speaking of breaks being wiped out, Guido Pella\u2019s back in it against Roberto Bautista Agut. The Spaniard\u2019s advantage is no more. It\u2019s 4-4 on Court 1. But Djokovic breaks back immediately, wearing Goffin down for 4-4. Oh men\u2019s tennis! Goffin pings one down the line to earn a break point. The applause gathers in intensity. Goffin takes charge of the rally and Djokovic ends up lifting a forehand off target to drop his serve. The underdog breaks for a 4-3 lead! Hooray for men\u2019s tennis! Goffin holds for 3-3 when Djokovic leaves a high ball and watches in horror as it drops inside the line. Oh Novak! Goffin gets into another Djokovic service game, but the world No 1 holds to 30. There have been some entertaining rallies. The question is how long Goffin can keep going toe to toe with Djokovic. Novak Djokovic cracks two vicious forehands to save break points in the third game of the first set. David Goffin, who has very neat hair (I like it - and wonder if he uses a comb), is holding his own during the early stages on Centre Court, but Djokovic holds for 2-1. David Goffin, slight in build but no slouch around the court, is a talented player. They say the Belgian is a bit like Djokovic. Only problem with that is Djokovic is better. Still, he\u2019s held his first service game. 1-1. Roberto Bautista Agut has made a lightning start against Guido Pella, breaking the Argentinian in the first game. But beware! Pella came back from two sets down to beat Milos Raonic on Monday. This is nothing. And ... play! The first men\u2019s quarter-finals are underway. Here come the players. The sun\u2019s peaking out from behind the clouds at SW19 and the temperature isn\u2019t too high. It\u2019s a pleasant day to play some tennis! Novak Djokovic and David Goffin are out on Centre Court, Roberto Bautista Agut and Guido Pella are out on Court 1. Andy Murray and Serena Williams will also be in action in the mixed doubles later. They\u2019re third on Court 2 and play the top seeds, Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar. Williams was utterly irrepressible last night. Today I will be giving you my professional tennis opinions. Hello. The state of men\u2019s tennis right now. Stefanos Tsitisipas, Alexander Zverev, Dominic Thiem and all the rest need to take a long hard look at themselves. But it\u2019s not just the so-called Next Gen struggling to take a giant leap at the grand slams.

The fourth round was a particular lowlight. Manic Monday was just a bit meh, with Djokovic cruising past Ugo Humbert (world No who cares), Nadal devouring Joao Sousa (world No look it up yourself) and Federer taking three seconds to see off Matteo Berrettini (world No it really doesn\u2019t matter). And it might not get much better in today\u2019s quarter-finals. For Djokovic, it\u2019s a match against David Goffin in the opener on Centre Court - he\u2019s won five of his six encounters with the 21st seed. For Nadal, it\u2019s a tussle with big-serving Sam Querrey \u2013 the No 3 seed will need to be careful against the big-serving American, who has beaten Murray and Djokovic here in the past, but he leads their head-to-head 4-1. And Federer, gliding along in regal fashion, faces Kei Nishikori \u2013 he leads 7-3 in his head-to-head with the eighth seed, who is making a habit of coming unstuck in the last eight of grand slams. In other news Roberto Bautista Agut, the 23rd seed, faces Guido Pella, the 26th seed. Bautista Agut is 31 and had never reached a grand slam quarter-final until this year\u2019s Australian Open. Pella is 29 and has never made it this far before. Hmmm. It has the air of predictability about it. On half of the draw Federer and Nadal will expect to secure the wins that will see them meet for the first time here since the 2008 final. On the other it\u2019s difficult to see anyone stopping Djokovic from reaching the final. And at this rate you\u2019re almost left wondering if tennis shouldn\u2019t just replace the grand slams with a Federer-Nadal-Djokovic Super League; just them playing each on a round robin basis for two weeks four times year. I reckon the crowds would lap it up. It\u2019s a good idea. I am willing to be paid a lot of money to make it a reality. Play begins at: 1pm BST.",

Then I\u2019ll kind of do \u2026 four to six weeks of training. Then I\u2019ll have some testing done after that again. Hopefully I will have progressed again. But I\u2019ve still got, like I said, quite a long way to go.\u201d</p> <p>Murray and Williams did well to force Soares and Melichar to a third set but the top seeds were too sharp, especially at the start of the decider, and were deserving winners.</p> <p>The Murray-Williams pairing \u2013 Murena or SerAndy, depending on your point of view \u2013 has captured the imagination of the crowd and even as they left No 2 Court, they were happy to stand among the throngs of people and sign plenty of autographs, smiling for the cameras.</p> <p>The worry when a player is out for a sustained period of time is that the tour will have moved on by the time they come back. Murray\u2019s style of play, based on his athleticism and defensive qualities, puts a lot of strain on his body and convention would suggest that if he does play singles again maybe he will need to become more aggressive and shorten the points.

      "bodyText": "It will be not be a surprise to anyone to learn that now his Wimbledon is over, Andy Murray plans to get down to work almost immediately. Murray\u2019s hopes of winning the mixed doubles title with Serena Williams ended with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 defeat against the No 1 seeds, Bruno Soares of Brazil and the American Nicole Melichar, but the two former champions got what they wanted out of the tournament: for Williams, more matches as she tries to equal Margaret Court\u2019s all-time grand slam singles titles record of 24; for Murray, more evidence his modified right hip will enable him to return to the singles court at some stage later this year. When exactly that will be remains to be seen but listening as Murray laid out his rough training schedule for the next couple of months, it seemed obvious the US Open will come too soon. Instead, perhaps the Murray Trophy, a Challenger Tour event named in the family\u2019s name, to be held in Glasgow in late September, may be a gentler, less pressured reintroduction to the tour. From his victory with Feliciano L\u00f3pez at Queen\u2019s last month to his efforts at Wimbledon over the past week or so, he has learned a lot about what he needs to do in the coming months if he is to have the chance to return to somewhere near the level that secured three grand slam singles titles, two Olympic gold medals, a Davis Cup and the No 1 ranking. \u201cI think I achieved a lot,\u201d Murray said. \u201cI think, considering the lack of matches, I did OK. The most positive thing is that my body felt good. My hip anyway was feeling good, so that was positive. It\u2019s a lot of physical work now trying to get stronger really, get a good balance with all of the kind of muscles around my hip. I think I\u2019m doing some physical testing next week. I did some pre-Queen\u2019s. \u201cIt will be interesting to see what\u2019s happened these last four weeks where I\u2019ve been obviously playing tennis but doing not much training, to see how things have progressed or not. Then I\u2019ll kind of do \u2026 four to six weeks of training. Then I\u2019ll have some testing done after that again. Hopefully I will have progressed again. But I\u2019ve still got, like I said, quite a long way to go.\u201d Murray and Williams did well to force Soares and Melichar to a third set but the top seeds were too sharp, especially at the start of the decider, and were deserving winners. The Murray-Williams pairing \u2013 Murena or SerAndy, depending on your point of view \u2013 has captured the imagination of the crowd and even as they left No 2 Court, they were happy to stand among the throngs of people and sign plenty of autographs, smiling for the cameras. The worry when a player is out for a sustained period of time is that the tour will have moved on by the time they come back. Murray\u2019s style of play, based on his athleticism and defensive qualities, puts a lot of strain on his body and convention would suggest that if he does play singles again maybe he will need to become more aggressive and shorten the points. Murray is not so sure. \u201cI would like to play the way I always played because it\u2019s been successful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think you need to always try to find that balance. I could go out and serve and volley every point, keep points short, lose in the first round every week. Then I\u2019d be getting killed when I came in here [to his press conference] for losing in the first round every week. \u201cYou need to find the right way of playing that would be good for your body but also allows you to be competitive and win matches. I\u2019ll only really know once I get back out there and start doing it, [if] there\u2019s things I need to change and adapt.\u201d The next few weeks should give Murray a good idea of the point his comeback has reached. Wimbledon planning Murray statue \u2013 when he retires Wimbledon are working on a statue of Andy Murray for when he retires, chairman Philip Brook has revealed. Chief executive Richard Lewis said in January after Murray raised the possibility of his imminent retirement that Wimbledon would honour the Scot in the same way as Fred Perry, whose bust is outside Centre Court. Speaking to a group of reporters in the All England Club boardroom, Brook said: \u201cWhat we don\u2019t want to do is retire him too early. Our thought all along is that we want to recognise Andy\u2019s significant achievements here at Wimbledon in an appropriate way and at an appropriate time. \u201cWe think an appropriate time is to unveil something when he retires. We are working on it. We have done some work already on it and there is still more work to do.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Iran has told Europe it will not reverse its decision to increase uranium enrichment beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear accord until it achieves its \u201cfull rights\u201d to an economic relationship with the EU under the deal. Ali Shamkhani, a senior security official and representative of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, made his remarks as he met a senior French diplomat sent to Tehran by the French president, Emmanuel Macron. Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, also warned the UK it would face as yet unspecified consequences as a result of the UK\u2019s seizure of an oil tanker bound for Syria off the coast of Gibraltar last week. The ship remains in British possession. Shamkhani\u2019s warning suggests the three European powers \u2013 France, Germany and the UK \u2013 face an uphill struggle to keep the nuclear deal alive. Shamkhani said the Iranian strategy could not change, and claimed European countries had shown a lack of will to keep their side of the bargain. Meanwhile, Donald Trump threatened to crank up sanctions substantially and accused Iran of \u201csecretly\u201d enriching uranium in breach of the nuclear accord. \u201cIran has long been secretly \u2018enriching\u2019, in total violation of the terrible 150 Billion Dollar deal made by John Kerry and the Obama Administration,\u201d Trump said on Twitter. \u201cSanctions will soon be increased, substantially!\u201d The 2014 deal imposed the most intrusive nuclear supervision in any country, and there has been no serious suggestion from elsewhere that Iran is secretly enriching uranium. Kazem Gharib Abadi, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency, said that all Tehran\u2019s nuclear activities were being monitored by inspectors from the agency. \u201cWe have nothing to hide,\u201d he said after an IAEA meeting in Vienna, which was called at the request of Washington. The two-day visit to Tehran by the French envoy, Emmanuel Bonne, was seen as probably the last attempt to broker a deal before Europe decided to put Iran\u2019s actions into the formal dispute mechanism of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If the dispute mechanism is unable to resolve the differences, it is likely the EU will restore sanctions against Iran that were taken off when the deal was first signed. Tehran has been demanding that the EU do more to compensate Iran for Donald Trump\u2019s decision to pull out of the deal last year, a withdrawal followed by a US attempt to impose maximum economic pressure on Tehran, including a worldwide ban on the purchase of Iranian oil exports. Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC), told Bonne on Wednesday that Tehran regarded Iran\u2019s action as within the terms of the JCPOA because the country was entitled to downgrade its commitments if the other side failed to meet their own. Iran has been frustrated by the slow European progress in setting up a long-planned financial mechanism designed to circumvent the impact of US secondary sanctions on firms that seek to trade with Iran. The EU says the slow progress is due to technical and legal difficulties, and not an absence of political will, but Tehran has been losing faith. Shamkhani insisted Iran would resist US pressure, saying: \u201cIran has in practice proved that in economic, political and defence dimensions it has the ability and capacity to manage and deal with various tensions and challenges. You cannot speak the language of force.\u201d Last week, UK authorities in Gibraltar intercepted an Iranian supertanker that was believed to be breaching EU sanctions by carrying a shipment of Tehran\u2019s crude oil to war-ravaged Syria. Royal Marines helped seize the tanker, together with Gibraltar police. Rouhani was quoted by the Iranian official IRNA news agency on Wednesday calling the seizure of the Iranian oil ship \u201cmean and wrong\u201d. During a cabinet meeting he warned London: \u201cYou are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions.\u201d",

During the incident he became unwell \u2013 officers immediately assisted and called an ambulance. The man was taken to hospital for treatment as a precaution, and is now in custody at an east London police station.

Salman Khan, 19, a sports teacher from west London, was a passenger in a car passing through the area when he stopped after seeing a commotion on the ground. \u201cMy heart was beating fast, I genuinely thought he was going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cThey held his legs and arms and stopped him from moving but he wasn\u2019t really moving, he was just shaking from the seizure. \u201cHe\u2019s having a fit, they should have let him go, tilted him to the side in the recovery position. It\u2019s quite clear that even his legs are shaking and people are screaming: \u2018Let go.\u2019 They treated him [medically] too late and they were to blame for the situation.\u201d Residents seemed incredulous that an argument over a man parked in a spot they said was often used by other vehicles, including from the minicab firm a few metres away, could escalate so dramatically. Joynal Hussain, 26, said: \u201cThey grabbed his hands and started wrestling with him. They were hitting him. It was very upsetting. You\u2019ve got the lady screaming, the children crying. It was emotional for everyone.\u201d Councillors, who have called a meeting for Friday to address residents\u2019 concerns, said tensions with police were already high in the area. John Biggs, the Labour mayor of Tower Hamlets, described the video as disturbing and said he had told the police they should refer it to the IOPC. \u201cWhile we should avoid jumping to conclusions, everyone must be able to feel safe on our streets and have confidence in our police,\u201d he said. Jack Gilbert, the chair of the local safer neighbourhood group, also said the case should be referred to the IOPC, questioning whether it was \u201ca proportionate response\u201d. Mark McEwan, the Met commander responsible for professionalism, said he understood how the incident looked to onlookers or people who had viewed footage on social media but that the man had resisted arrest, adding: \u201cThe man is subsequently arrested on suspicion of obstruction of the highway, assaulting police and resisting arrest. During the incident he became unwell \u2013 officers immediately assisted and called an ambulance. The man was taken to hospital for treatment as a precaution, and is now in custody at an east London police station. Two officers suffered minor injuries.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 July 2019. An earlier version misspelled Amal Bentahar\u2019s last name and stated that Youness Bentahar requires oxygen for a medical condition when it is actually for his child.",

The supreme court so held in January 2017 in the case brought by Gina Miller (for whom I acted as counsel) successfully challenging Theresa May\u2019s decision to notify the EU of Britain\u2019s intention to withdraw from membership without first seeking the approval of parliament.</p> \n   <p>Whether prorogation is a breach of the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty depends on the circumstances of the case. In Canada in 2008 [where parliament was prorogued for political reasons] the issue did not come to court.</p> \n   <p>There would be three important features of a case in October. First, the prime minister would be seeking to prorogue parliament for the purpose of avoiding parliamentary sovereignty on an issue of significant constitutional importance.</p> \n   <p>Second, he would be seeking to stop parliament sitting when time would be of the essence, given the deadline of the end of October.</p> \n   <p>And third, he would be seeking to evade parliament because it has previously made clear its wish to prevent a no-deal Brexit. If he were to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament in these circumstances, the courts would be likely to hear an urgent application and then declare his advice to be unlawful.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a useful Twitter thread, starting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1148870904581185536\">here</a>, the barrister <strong>Jo Maugham</strong> has compiled a list, with links, of some more articles addressing this question.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1148870904581185536\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A short bibliography of some of the literature on whether the could be a judicial review of (in effect) the decision to seek a prorogation of Parliament. /THREAD</p>\u2014 Jo Maugham QC (@JolyonMaugham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JolyonMaugham/status/1148870904581185536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T09:48:53.192Z\">at 10.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d25a7f38f0845f89e30a1ec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T08:59:06.462Z\">9.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The BBC\u2019s <strong>Laura Kuenssberg </strong>points out that, given where the Conservative party membership is on Brexit, John Major\u2019s threat to go to court to stop a no-deal Brexit prorogation will probably be helpful to Boris Johnson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1148856117621133312\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In the dynamics of this Tory race tho, Major\u2019s threat will probably give more fire to Brexit supporters</p>\u2014 Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1148856117621133312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d25a76f8f08cf92bb76cdea\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T08:54:50.666Z\">9.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Charlie Falconer</strong>,<strong> </strong>a former Labour lord chancellor (and that was in the days when the lord chancellor had to be a QC, not just a jobbing cabinet minister), says John Major is right to say that there would be a good case for taking a decision to prorogue parliament to avoid a no-deal Brexit to judicial review (JR).</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/LordCFalconer/status/1148854127960739840\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">John Major says he would apply for an immediate Juducial Review against the Prime Minister preventing him advising HMQ to prorogue Parliament to facilitate No Deal.

As a Telegraph journalist in the 1990s Johnson regularly ridiculed the Major government, and the former prime minister hasn\u2019t forgotten, or forgiven. In his Today interview this morning Major said he was supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Conservative leadership, despite some reservations (he does not agree with Hunt\u2019s willingness to accept a no-deal Brexit as an option). But Major spent most of the interview criticising Johnson, and in particular two Johnson positions that were illuminated in last night\u2019s ITV debate: Johnson\u2019s refusal to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson\u2019s refusal to confirm that he would keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington following President Trump\u2019s declaration that he will no longer deal with Darroch.</p> \n  <p>Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit.</strong> Although proroguing is a prerogative power that is hard to challenge, Major said he thought a legal challenge was possible.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>In order to close down parliament, the prime minister would have to go to Her Majesty the Queen and ask for her permission to prorogue. If her first minister asks for that permission, it is almost inconceivable that the Queen will do anything other than grant it ... She is then in the midst of a constitutional controversy, that no serious politician should put the Queen in the middle of.</p> \n   <p>Now, I think this is completely and utterly against parliamentary tradition, and against the way in which our government should work.</p> \n   <p>If that were to happen. I think there would be a queue of people who would seek judicial review. The Queen\u2019s decision cannot be challenged in law. But the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen can, I believe, be challenged in law and I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed. </p> \n   <p>I served in parliament for over 20 years. I\u2019m very proud to have done so. I have huge admiration for our parliamentary traditions. I\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion. It is utterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Major said proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cutterly and totally unacceptable for any British parliamentarian or democrat\u201d.</strong> He also said it would be hypocritical from someone like Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit so that parliament could take back control. Major said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Let\u2019s strip away the jargon of proroguing and contemplate what this actually means. What it means is that a prime minister \u2013 Prime Minister Johnson, presumably \u2013 because he cannot persuade parliament to agree with his policy, will close down parliament so that he can bypass it until his policy comes into operation. </p> \n   <p>Now, nobody has done that since King Charles II in the 1640s and it didn\u2019t end well for him. And it shouldn\u2019t end well. You cannot and should not bypass parliament in this fashion. And I cannot imagine how anyone could conceivably think that is right ...</p> \n   <p>I seem to recall that the Brexiteers, led by Mr Johnson, actually campaigned in the referendum for the sovereignty of Parliament ... They can\u2019t be concerned for the sovereignty of Parliament except when it is inconvenient to Mr Johnson.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Major said the UK government should keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to the US, despite President Trump\u2019s refusal to deal with him.</strong> He defended Darroch, and said that in giving his \u201cunvarnished views\u201d about the Trump administration he was just doing his job. Major said it was unacceptable to allow foreign governments to choose the British ambassadors who should serve in their countries. Major went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is a secondary point that Mr Johnson and everybody else should ponder. The whole of the diplomatic service, which is vital to the interests of this country, will have seen that one of their most senior diplomats was prepared to be thrown to the wolves because of the criticism of a non-British government. I do not think that is good for the morale of the civil service. And I do not think anybody who does that will endear themselves in obtaining the loyalty of the civil service in future. Loyalty is a two-way street. Mr Darroch has not misbehaved. He has behaved exactly as he was expected to behave, indeed, probably instructed to behave. And he deserves the support of the British government.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Major said the government should keep Darroch in post even if this meant a \u201cshort-term freeze\u201d in relations with Washington.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>If this means a short term freeze in relationships, that would be very unfortunate, because America [is] a very important ally of this country and always [has] been. But nonetheless there comes a time with principle has to come first. And the principle that we stand by our ambassadors when they have behaved entirely properly, is one that cannot be changed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1148869403578159107\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Former British PM Sir John Major will \"seek a judicial review\" to prevent the next prime minister suspending Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/r4today?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#r4today</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MyWlMEV8nK\">https://t.co/MyWlMEV8nK</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/0aLl8Ej5H5\">pic.twitter.com/0aLl8Ej5H5</a></p>\u2014 BBC Radio 4 Today (@BBCr4today) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCr4today/status/1148869403578159107?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">July 10, 2019</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T10:03:49.155Z\">at 11.03am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5d2595648f08d0b6ca52d8cf\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2019-07-10T07:52:19.801Z\">8.52am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">John Major threatens court action to stop Boris Johnson proroguing parliament for Brexit</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the ITV Tory leadership debate last night Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to be the next prime minister, again refused to rule out proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit.

      "bodyText": "Senior Labour figures were accused by a number of whistleblowers of undermining efforts to investigate allegations of antisemitism by interfering in the internal party complaints process, ahead of a BBC Panorama programme at 9pm tonight which asks \u2018Is Labour Anti-Semitic?\u2019 Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to Washington who has been at the centre of a diplomatic row over leaked cables criticising Donald Trump, has resigned. Ursula von der Leyen, the nominee to lead the European commission, has signalled she will not reopen Brexit talks with the next British prime minister and stressed the \u201cprecious\u201d Irish backstop must be defended. Downing Street has said the government will deliver on landmark House of Commons votes extending same-sex marriage and abortion rights to Northern Ireland, indicating Theresa May supports the principles of the backbench amendments, if not their methods. The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland has warned against complacency over political limbo as an official report predicts that 40,000 jobs are at risk in the region in the event of a no-deal Brexit. That\u2019s all for tonight. Thanks for reading, and your comments. Four whistleblowers speak of top Labour aides interfering in antisemitism investigations - video Labour MP\u2019s and commentators supportive of Jeremy Corbyn are being advised on how to respond to tonight\u2019s Panorama programme, according to HuffPost\u2019s Paul Waugh. Former shadow business minister Stella Creasy tweeted: If this is actually real and has been produced by someone within the Labour Party then heads should absolutely roll for it .. We need to tackle the problem of antisemitism, not try to \u2018spin\u2019 or \u2018drown out\u2019 the voices brave enough to speak out about it. Jeremy Hunt has confirmed he was not the Tory leadership candidate who raised concerns about the composition of the BBC debate between him and Boris Johnson, which was slated for next Tuesday. This just in from Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker. Eight whistleblowers have told how they felt consistently undermined by senior Labour bosses in attempts to tackle antisemitism, alleging consistent interference in complaints and claiming that one key aide mocked their efforts. Four of the whistleblowers, including the former Labour general secretary Iain McNicol, who left his post last year, have broken non-disclosure agreements to come forward. Speaking to the BBC\u2019s Panorama programme, about which the Labour party has raised complaints to the highest level at the BBC, former officials allege key aides including Labour\u2019s director of communications, Seumas Milne and Labour\u2019s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, interfered with investigations. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s personal email address was also copied into leaked email chains, which former officials allege show interference. Labour robustly denies any interference and say that \u201cformer disaffected employees sought the view of staff in the leader\u2019s office, which was complied with in good faith\u201d. Labour peer Lord Falconer has said the party is \u201cstill in denial\u201d about antisemitism within its ranks. He told BBC Radio 4\u2019s PM programme: The thing that most strikes me about it, is it\u2019s a Labour party still in denial. Hearing Andrew Gwynne, who is a decent man, still trying to defend what\u2019s going on is a problem. Falconer said that Labour was not taking the issue seriously, despite: The Equality and Human Rights Commission launching a full statutory investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism within the party. Suspended MP Chris Williamson \u201cbaiting the Jewish community by his persistent and utterly inappropriate support of people that are antisemitic\u201d. Peter Willsman, an NEC member, saying \u201call this antisemitism is got up by the Israeli embassy\u201d. The Labour Party, my party, will not take it seriously and it is absolutely appalling. I don\u2019t know why it is, I think it is because too many people think it is wrapped up in factionalism. On whether much of the criticism over antisemitism was disguised to undermine Jeremy Corbyn as leader, Falconer said: I don\u2019t think it is. I think there is a very real problem about antisemitism. I think there are some people who want to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn who draw attention to the problems of antisemitism. I don\u2019t think that means the problems of antisemitism are illusory or unreal. But whatever the position, what you\u2019ve got to do is look at the evidence. Now I haven\u2019t seen the Panorama programme, I\u2019ve only heard the extracts that you\u2019ve read me, those extracts are as hair-raising and as anxiety-inducing as the Willsman case I referred to, and the Williamson case which everyone knows about. He added that he did not believe antisemitism was part of Labour\u2019s DNA, and stressed he did not believe Corbyn was antisemitic. However, he claimed a number of antisemites had joined the party since 2015 and \u201cmust be thrown out\u201d. Falconer went on to criticise Labour for using non-disclosure agreements to stop former staffers from revealing details of how the party handles complaints. He said the NDA\u2019s were being wielded by a party acting more \u201clike a big business or an executive\u201d who sought to cover up abuse. After speaking to the Foreign Affairs select committee, the department\u2019s permanent under-secretary Simon McDonald convened an all-staff meeting to express solidarity with the outgoing ambassador to the US, Kim Darroch. This is from Mark Warner, a Democratic senator in the US and vice chair of the senate intelligence committee. This counters President Trump\u2019s claim (dismissed as absurd by diplomatic experts) that Kim Darroch was \u201cnot liked or well thought of within the US\u201d. That\u2019s all from me for today. My colleague Mattha Busby is taking over. Here is the top of the embargoed news release that the BBC has sent out about its Panorama tonight about Labour and antisemitism. Eight former Labour officials, including seven from the complaints and disputes department, have spoken to BBC Panorama, to discuss antisemitism in the Labour party. They all worked for the party over the last four years, and all have now left. Four are speaking out despite having signed NDAs with the Labour party. In total Panorama has spoken to more than 20 Labour officials, which includes many of the officials who have been dealing with antisemitism complaints since 2015. Their testimony reveals: A complaints and disciplinary system that had to deal with a huge increase in antisemitism complaints since Jeremy Corbyn became leader in 2015. Allegations that there were substantial disagreements within the party about what constituted antisemitism. Allegations of interference in the complaints process from the leader\u2019s office, including a claim that there was even one occasion when complaints were directly processed by aides in Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Westminster Office. Discussion by the general secretary about interference with the national constitution committee (NCC), the independent body within the Labour party that has the final say over expulsions. David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and Theresa May\u2019s de facto deputy, was speaking to the Commons Brexit committee this afternoon. The Economist\u2019s John Peet has some highlights. Boris Johnson is has been widely criticised at Westminster today for not backing Sir Kim Darroch, the outgoing ambassador to Washington, after President Trump said he would no longer deal with him. But, according to this YouGov poll, public opinion on this is fairly evenly divided. YouGov found 41% of respondents saying the government should support Darroch when it polled on this yesterday, but 35% saying Darroch should be replaced with someone more amenable to the White House. The BBC was meant to be holding a Question Time special with both Tory leadership candidates next Tuesday. But, according to the Sun\u2019s Steve Hawkes, it now looks as if that will not go ahead. Tonight the BBC is showing an hour-long Panorama programme looking at how Labour has dealt with allegations of antisemitism. There have been claims that the revelations will be damaging and Labour, which has been approached for its side of the story, has responded with a long letter to Tony Hall, the BBC director general, complaining about the programme. Here is an extract from the Labour letter. We\u2019ve had a number of questions put to us by the Panorama team and we\u2019ve answered them fully and extensively. We\u2019ve given them 50 pages of documentation in response to their questions and we\u2019ve also complained to the BBC at various levels including director general level over the way the process has been engaged in, the lack of engagement with us at an earlier stage and the failure to come to us with a balanced and fair set of questions. And from what we\u2019ve seen of the questions and the nature of the investigation, the Panorama team had already come to a conclusion about where its investigation was going before it looked at the evidence in full. We are absolutely adamantly opposed to antisemitism in all its forms and we will continue to take the strongest action to eradicate it from the Labour Party and we\u2019ve taken a series of steps. Momentum, the pro-Corbyn Labour group, has also been using Twitter to attack John Ware, the reporter who made the programme. As the Times\u2019 Matt Chorley reports, this is the same John Ware who was described as an \u201cever-vigilant investigative journalist\u201d in a congratulatory Commons early day motion signed by Jeremy Corbyn in 2002. Asked about the Labour criticism, a BBC spokesperson said: The Labour party is criticising a programme they have not seen. The programme adheres to the BBC\u2019s editorial guidelines. In line with those, the Labour Party has been given the opportunity to respond to the allegations. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, says the resignation of Kim Darroch has shamed the UK. In a statement she said: The fact that Sir Kim has been bullied out of his job, because of Donald Trump\u2019s tantrums and Boris Johnson\u2019s pathetic lick-spittle response, is something that shames our country. It makes a laughing-stock out of our government, and tells every one of Britain\u2019s brilliant representatives abroad that the next Tory prime minister will not stand up for them, even when they are simply telling the truth and doing their job. Sir Kim Darroch should hold his head high for the wonderful job he has done representing our country, while Boris Johnson should go and hang his head in shame. He claims to regard Winston Churchill as his hero. But just imagine Churchill allowing this humiliating, servile, sycophantic indulgence of the American president\u2019s ego to go unchallenged. Johnson likes to accuse opponents of being \u2018supine invertebrate jellies\u2019. How does he think he looks today? If this is what represents the future of leadership in our country, then it is all the more reason why we must force Johnson to call an election, and let the British people decide if such an obsequious weakling should be our prime minister. House of Lords staff have been subject to bullying and harassment, an inquiry has found. The investigation by Naomi Ellenbogen QC stated: The prevailing culture and behaviours in the House of Lords, as a place of work, have not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure that all those working there are treated with dignity and respect. Staff have bullied and harassed other staff. Members have bullied and harassed staff. On the whole, staff who have experienced bullying and harassment have tended not to complain, formally or otherwise, in the belief that nothing will happen and/or for fear of reprisal. Scotland\u2019s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has described it as \u201cshameful\u201d that Kim Darroch has been forced out \u201cfor doing the job that diplomats are appointed to do\u201d. Responding to a tweet from Nigel Farage that suggested Darroch be replaced by a Brexiter, Sturgeon added: Who could Farage be thinking of? The last thing that should happen is the politicisation of the civil service and the replacement of honourable diplomats with charlatans like this guy. Meanwhile, the SNP\u2019s foreign affairs spokesperson, Stephen Gethins MP, said that the resignation was a \u201cdeeply concerning and a worrying sign of where the UK\u2019s role on the international stage is heading\u201d, adding: The integrity and impartiality of the civil service must not be compromised. It would be unacceptable if the UK\u2019s diplomatic service and appointments were outsourced to the whims of the Trump administration. Jeremy Corbyn says Boris Johnson\u2019s refusal to back Kim Darroch in the ITV debate last night showed \u201che won\u2019t stand up to Donald Trump\u201d. Mark Francois, the Tory Brexiter, says Theresa May should leave it to her successor to appoint the next ambassador to Washington. Speaking at an Institute for Government event, he told the Guardian: This must have been a very difficult decision for Kim Darroch. But what is most important now is that it is the new prime minister who takes the decision on who his replacement will be because the relationship with the US will be fundamentally important, not least when we have left the EU. The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland has warned against \u201ccomplacency\u201d over political limbo in the region as an official report predicts that 40,000 jobs are at risk in the region in the event of a no-deal Brexit. (See 2.07pm.) David Sterling was accused of engaging in \u201coperation fear\u201d in March by a Brexiter Conservative MP by warning of the \u201cgrave\u201d consequences for the region. Today he said he had \u201cdeveloped a thick skin\u201d in the face of such criticism but that those fears still hold. \u201cOur assessment is that no-deal would have a profound and longlasting impact on Northern Ireland and society, a point I made back in March and it remains valid today,\u201d said Sterling speaking at the Institute for Government in London. He said the uncertainty over Brexit was now impacting on investment with latest local purchasing managers index (PMI) data showing the \u201cstrongest reduction in output since September 2012\u201d. He also warned that there would be an increase in smuggling on the border and the community relations in those areas could deteriorate. [No-deal] could change the attitude in communities which over time could have an impact in the culture of those areas. While tensions around parades has been in \u201cdecline\u201d and there was \u201cless street disorder\u201d, there were \u201cother societal tensions that are probably the result of the political impasse,\u201d he said. We wouldn\u2019t want to overstate it but at the same time I wouldn\u2019t be complacent \u2026 it would wrong to be complacent and think this will be the same for evermore. He said the absence of Stormont has meant that Northern Ireland issues don\u2019t get the airing they should in Westminster. \u201cWe have lacked that ministerial voice in Whitehall that has championed the cause of Northern Ireland,\u201d he said adding he not want to see direct rule. Here are the main points from Sir Simon McDonald\u2019s evidence about the Kim Darroch leak to the foreign affairs committee. McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office said he was bracing himself for more leaks of sensitive diplomatic memos. \u201cI fear there may be more,\u201d he said, when asked about the possibility of further leaks. He said that he could not think of another example in his 37-year diplomatic career of a head of state refusing to deal with a British ambassador, in the way President Trump said he would refuse to deal with Sir Kim Darroch. McDonald said he could not think of this happening even with governments hostile to the UK, although he could think of precedents for an ambassador resigning because of difficult relations with an unfriendly power. McDonald described the leak as the \u201cworst breach of trust\u201d he had seen in the diplomatic service in his career. He said Foreign Office staff were \u201cshaken\u201d by what had happened. He said that the police were involved in the leak investigation. He said he had had a \u201cfree and frank\u201d exchange of views with the charge d\u2019affaires at the American embassy about Trump\u2019s comments about Darroch. A Labour source said Boris Johnson was behaving as Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cpatsy\u201d if his lack of support prompted Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation, the Press Association reports. The Labour source said: If that\u2019s the case I think it is clear that Boris Johnson is effectively behaving as Donald Trump\u2019s patsy and he\u2019s doing that clearly because he\u2019s banking on a sweetheart trade deal and is putting himself in hock to the US president. It\u2019s clear that he is not prepared and won\u2019t stand up to Donald Trump and he won\u2019t stand up for Britain and that\u2019s clearly the result of a policy on Brexit that is putting the country at risk of a no-deal exit from the European Union. This is from David Miliband, a Labour former foreign secretary. From my colleague Peter Walker These are from Nick Boles, who used to be a Conservative MP but who now sits as an independent. A no-deal Brexit could cost 40,000 jobs in Northern Ireland, an updated report from the region\u2019s department of economy has said. It said: A no deal would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI\u2019s economy and society. No-deal could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment with at least 40,000 jobs at risk. It said the impact of EU tariffs and non-tariff barriers will mean that whatever the Irish government and the EU do \u201cmany businesses will no longer be able to export to the Irish market, leading to a major reduction in NI\u2019s exports to Ireland,\u201d it said. It predicted the impact of EU tariffs could reduce NI\u2019s exports to Ireland by 11% to \u00a3100m to \u00a3180m. Aodh\u00e1n Connolly, director of the Northern Irish Retail Consortium, said the report made for \u201cstark reading\u201d but \u201cno surprise\u201d as business had been warning of the consequences of no deal for more than a year. Downing Street said Theresa May spoke to Sir Kim Darroch for around five minutes shortly before PMQs today. This is from the Labour peer Andrew Adonis on the removal of Kim Darroch. Back in the foreign affairs committee Sir Simon McDonald, head of the Foreign Office, says he has served as an ambassador twice. He says diplomats use \u2018diptels\u201d (diplomatic telegrams) when they want information circulated quite widely in the system. They are not used for information that is particularly sensitive. But they are there if an ambassador wants to pass on information not being picked up by the media. Here are comments from three Labour MPs on Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation. From Ben Bradshaw, a former Foreign Office minister From Bill Esterson From Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs committee The Conservative MP Bob Seely asks McDonald if he accepts that it looks as if only a relatively small number of memos were leaked, rather than a large cache. McDonald says he does not want to comment. And Tom Tugendhat, the committee chair, asks McDonald if he has met his counterpart in the American embassy recently. McDonald said he did have a meeting. They had a \u201cfree and frank\u201d exchange of views, he says. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant goes next. He asks McDonald thinks there will be more leaks. McDonald says he is \u201cbraced\u201d for further revelations. \u201cI fear there may be more,\u201d he says. Back in the committee Labour\u2019s Ian Murray asks what the Foreign Office would think about having a political appointee as the next ambassador to Washington. McDonald says there is one in post already, Ed Llewellyn, the ambassador to Paris. He says political appointees are subject to security procedures after their appointment. Q: What would happen if they failed? McDonald says that has not happened before. If it were to happen, he would have to have a difficult conversation with the PM, he says. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation will lead to soul-searching across the Foreign Office and he criticised the failure of the former foreign secretary Boris Johnson to offer the ambassador his backing. Kerslake said: Darroch did nothing wrong ... We cannot pander to Trump\u2019s insecurity. There is going to have to be a lot of soul searching in the FCO as to how we arrived at this point. Asked whether Johnson\u2019s lack of support may have been a factor in Darroch\u2019s decision, Kerslake said: It was depressingly predictable for Boris. I wish that he had stood up [to the president] and been more forthright. Boris will rely on robust advice from ambassadors if he becomes prime minister. Hunt gave a much better answer to this question [in the ITV debate]. Back in the foreign affairs committee Sir Simon McDonald, head of the Foreign Office, says diplomats have been \u201cshaken\u201d by what has happened. Asked if he thought the establishment should stand should to shoulder with a diplomat like Kim Darroch, he said of course. He said the Foreign Office was grateful for what Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt have said about this. On a campaign visit to a pub in London this morning - alongside Brexiteer and JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin - Boris Johnson was asked about John Major\u2019s threat to go to court to stop Johnson proroguing parliament. (See 8.52am.) Johnson replied: What we are going to do is deliver Brexit on October 31, which is what I think the people of this country want us to get on and do. I think everybody is fed up with delay and I think the idea of now consecrating this decision to the judiciary is really very, very odd indeed. What we want is for Parliament to take their responsibilities, get it done as they promised that they would. They asked the British people whether they wanted to leave in 2016, the British people returned a very clear verdict so let\u2019s get it done. McDonald says the most sensitive diplomatic memos are only circulated to between five and 10 people. But every computer has a forward button, he says. McDonald says the Foreign Office will pursue who was responsible for this leak with all means at its disposal. And he says diplomats must continue to give frank advice to London. But he will urge people to think again about what can be done to ensure their communications are secure, he says. This is from Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair\u2019s former communications chief. Back in the committee McDonald says some of the leaked memos were \u201cdiptels\u201d, diplomatic telegrams, that are circulated quite widely, and others were email letters, which have a much smaller Whitehall readership. Here is the full quote from what Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, told the BBC about Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson - a former foreign secretary and he hopes to be the future prime minister - has basically thrown our top diplomat under the bus, There are a lot of people in the Commons who are very, very angry and feel that he has lost so much respect for having done what he has done. His disregard for Sir Kim and his refusal to back him was pretty contemptible and also not in the best interests of the country he is trying to lead ... Commenting on Johnson\u2019s failure to defend Darroch in the ITV debate last night, Duncan said: For someone who wants to lead, let alone unite, the country, that was contemptible negligence on his part. He has basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under the bus to serve his own personal interests. Q: What is the process for appointing a new ambassador? McDonald says the standard procedure is for the post to be advertised, candidates to be interviewed, and then decisions taken by the foreign secretary and the prime minister. But that process is not always followed when a new ambassador to Washington is being appointed, he says. McDonald says Darroch knew that the government was committed to keeping him in place. But Darroch decided to go anyway, he says. Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, has just started giving evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about the Kim Darroch affairs. He starts by saying that Darroch decided to resign partly because of the pressure on his family. And he says that, in his 37 years as a diplomat, he can think of no other example where a friendly government has refused to deal with a serving ambassador, in the way that President Trump said he would refuse to deal with Darroch. McDonald says there have been occasions where a government has refused to accept a proposed ambassador in the first place. Q: Has the UK ever had difficulties with America before? McDonald says the last time there was a problem like this was in 1856, when the Americans objected to the British ambassador recruiting Americans to fight in the Crimean War. PMQs - Snap verdict: Jeremy Corbyn had a good case to make on legal aid cuts, and he presented it quite well - being only moderately unsettled by Theresa May\u2019s attack over antisemitism - but it was still something of a lost opportunity for him, highlighting how his lack of dexterity at PMQs continues to hold him back. A more strategic leader of the opposition would have prepared questions on Kim Darroch, to drive a wedge between May and the person who will almost certainly be leading her party two weeks\u2019 today and a first-rate parliamentarian would have rewritten the script at the last moment, after Darroch\u2019s resignation was announced, to hammer Boris Johnson with lines we are now hearing from fellow Tories. (See 12.41pm and 12.45pm.) But why should he follow the media, you might ask? Aren\u2019t legal aid cuts more important than the career of one civil servant? Yes they are. (Read the brilliant The Secret Barrister.) But PMQs is a media event, and if Corbyn had chosen go focus on Darroch, he would have got his attack lines into the top of the news bulletins. As it is, his legal aid critique is unlikely to get much further than Facebook. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but you can\u2019t chalk it up as a communications victory. Boris Johnson has said he regrets the resignation of Kim Darroch. Describing Darroch as \u201ca superb diplomat\u201d, he went on: I think whoever leaked his diptels (diplomatic telegrams) really has done a grave disservice to our civil servants, to people who give impartial advice to ministers. I hope that whoever it is, is run down, caught and eviscerated, quite frankly, because it is not right that advice to ministers that civil servants must be able to make in a spirit of freedom should be leaked. It is not right that civil servants\u2019 careers and prospects should be dragged into the political agenda. In PMQs Sir Vince Cable says Theresa May\u2019s last job will be to recommend to the Queen who her successor should be. How will she be sure that that person can command a majority in the Commons? May says, whoever wins the Tory leadership contest, they will make an excellent PM. From my colleague Jennifer Rankin This is from Peter Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office. Another senior Tory has criticised Boris Johnson for refusing to stand up for Sir Kim Darroch, This is from Patrick McLoughlin, the former Tory chief whip, who is supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership. It is unedifying to see someone who wants to be prime minister failing to stand up for hard working civil servants, who have done nothing wrong, under attack from foreign governments. Leadership involves standing up for your team. If we don\u2019t call out those who want a witch-hunt through the civil service we are complicit in creating divisions that may never heal. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, has put out this statement about Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s resignation. I am deeply saddened by Sir Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign as Her Majesty\u2019s Ambassador in Washington. For 42 years, Sir Kim served his country with the utmost dedication and distinction. He brought dispassionate insight and directness to his reporting to ministers in London. Whenever I visited Washington as foreign secretary, I was struck by Sir Kim\u2019s professionalism and intellect. I am outraged that a selection of his reports should have been leaked. I am sure that our ambassadors worldwide will continue to provide the objective and rigorous reporting that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has always prized. I profoundly regret how this episode has led Sir Kim to decide to resign. He deserves to look back upon his career as a servant of Britain with the greatest satisfaction and pride. Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister, has told the BBC that Boris Johnson\u2019s treatment of Kim Darroch was \u201ccontemptible\u201d. Last night Duncan, who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, described Johnson as an \u201cutter wimp\u201d. (See 11.07am.) This is from Dave Penman, the head of the FDA, the union which represents senior civil servants, on Kim Darroch\u2019s decision to resign. Sir Kim Darroch has been placed in an impossible situation, firstly by the leaking of confidential communiques and then by the failure of Boris Johnson and his supporters to provide unequivocal support. As a loyal public servant he has, as he always did, put his country first. Can we honestly say that about those who took to the airways and equivocated? Johnson and his allies have sent the clearest signal possible to Sir Kim, the diplomatic corp, the wider civil service and unfortunately to foreign governments: that their professional, impartial advice is needed, but they are ultimately expendable if it proves politically expedient. And this is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian\u2019s diplomatic editor. This is from the Daily Mail\u2019s Jason Groves. This is from Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland\u2019s first minister, on the resignation of Kim Darroch. The SNP leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, says every time Theresa May speaks in Scotland, the SNP vote goes up. He says today is the Srebrenica memorial day. He says it is a pity that Boris Johnson did not stand up for Kim Darroch yesterday. Mark Carney says the UK economy is not growing. And Danny Blanchlower says the economy is already in recession, Blackford says. (It sounds like he\u2019s been reading Aditya Chakrabortty\u2019s Guardian column today.) May says the economy is doing well, but would have been doing even better if the SNP had voted for a Brexit deal. Blackford says May is driving the UK economy over the cliff. He urges her to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. May repeats her point about how the SNP could have taken no-deal off the table by voting for her deal. She says forecasts show the Scottish economy is expected to grow more slowly than the economy in the rest of the UK under the SNP. Here is the full quote from Theresa May earlier on Kim Darroch. This morning I have spoken to Sir Kim Darroch. I have told him that it is a matter of great regret that he has felt it necessary to leave his position as ambassador in Washington. The whole cabinet rightly gave its full support to Sir Kim on Tuesday. Sir Kim has given a lifetime of service to the United Kingdom and we owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. Good government depends on public servants being able to give full and frank advice. I want all our public servants to have the confidence to be able to do that and I hope the House will reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure. Corbyn says he is totally committed to tackling racism in any form in the Labour party. Shouldn\u2019t May address Islamophobia in the Conservative party. He says May should listen to what the UN said about the government\u2019s disregard for the rights of disabled people. And he turns to Windrush. Does May agree that that scandal would not have happened if legal aid had not been cut? May says Corbyn needs to consider his arguments. She has apologised for what happened to the Windrush generation. She says a review found 18 people wrongly deported, but some of those cases happened under Labour. She says Labour claims to back whistleblowers, and yet it uses NDAs. He used to back leave, but now backs remains. He lives up to the words of Marx, not Karl but Groucho - \u201cThose are my prinicples. If you don\u2019t like them, I\u2019ve got others.\u201d Corbyn says he will not take lectures from May. Her party consorts with racists in the European parliaments. He says legal aid cuts have disproportionately affected the poor and the disabled. Millions are denied access to justice because they are poor. Isn\u2019t that a burning injustice? May says Corbyn can try to avoid the antisemitism issue. She quotes the former Labour general secretary saying that one day Labour may be anti-racist, but not today. She attacks Labour for wanting to to tax more. Labour used to have a slogan, \u201cEducation, education, education.\u201d Now it is just, \u201cTax, tax, tax.\u201d Corbyn says the coalition cut legal aid, and introduced fees for tribunals. But his union, Unison, took the government to court and won. He quotes a leaseholder who is being threatened with eviction who cannot get legal aid. He has been working until 2am every night collecting evidence. Doesn\u2019t he deserve legal aid? May says a quarter of the ministry of justice\u2019s budget is spent on legal aid. He says the government is reviewing legal aid schemes. Corbyn says Labour is committed to restoring legal aid for family law, housing, judicial review preparation and real action on immigration cases. He says the government should restore the cuts affecting disabled people. May says spending on disabled people is at a record high. If Corbyn is interested in tackling injustice, he should deal with antisemitism, she says. Jeremy Corbyn says he also regrets the resignation of Kim Darroch. He says the comments made about him are beyond unfair and wrong. He says many people welcomed the points Theresa May made when she was first appointed about burning injustices when she became PM. Does she agree that access to justice is vital? May says there are many aspects to this. She says the racial disparities audit she commissioned highlighted an important aspect of what needed to be done. Corbyn says the coalition slashed legal aid. The results are unfair, he says. There are legal aid deserts across the country. Has that helped or hindered the fight against burning injustices. May says tackling burning injustice is not just a matter of access to the legal system. If Labour cared about this, they would have done more when they were in power. Theresa May starts by saying she spoke to Sir Kim Darroch this morning and told him it was a matter of great regret that he felt the need to resign. The whole cabinet supported him on Tuesday, she said. She said good public servants should be able to offer honest advice. And she says MPs should reflect on the importance of standing up for principles when they are under threat. May implicitly criticises Boris Johnson for refusing to back Kim Darroch. UPDATE: See 12.21pm for the full quote. And this is what Sir Simon McDonald, the head of the Foreign Office, said in his reply to Sir Kim Darroch. On behalf of the diplomatic service, I accept your resignation with deep personal regret. Over the last few difficult days you have behaved as you have always behaved over a long and distinguished career, with dignity, professionalism and class. The prime minister, foreign secretary and whole of the public service have stood with you: you were the target of a malicious leak; you were simply doing your job. I understand your wish to relieve the pressure on your family and your colleagues at the embassy; I admire the fact that you think more of others than yourself. You demonstrate the essence of the values of British public service I want to stress my deep appreciation for all you have done over the last four decades. In a series of demanding roles - including national security adviser and permanent representative to the European Union - you have loyally served the government of the day without fear or favour. We have been lucky to have you as a friend and colleague. You are the best of us. This is what Sir Kim Darroch said in his resignation letter. Since the leak of official documents from this embassy there has been a great deal of speculation surrounding my position and the duration of my remaining term as ambassador. I want to put an end to that speculation. The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like. Although my posting is not due to end until the end of this year, I believe in the current circumstances the responsible course is to allow the appointment of a new ambassador. I am grateful to all those in the UK and the US, who have offered their support during this difficult few days. This has brought home to me the depth of friendship and close ties between our two countries. I have been deeply touched. I am also grateful to all those with whom I have worked over the last four decades, particularly my team here in the US. The professionalism and integrity of the British civil service is the envy of the world. I will leave it full of confidence that its values remain in safe hands. Kim Darroch has resigned as ambassador to Washington, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. Yesterday Labour announced that it would campaign for remain in any second referendum on a Tory Brexit deal. But Jeremy Corbyn refused to say that the party would propose in its manifesto if there were an early general election. At a meeting earlier this week union leaders said the party should go into an election promising to negotiate a Labour Brexit, with the outcome put to the public in a referendum, but the shadow cabinet has not agreed to this plan. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said Labour\u2019s election position would be decided at the time, and it would depend when an election was called. But he conceded that it would be hard for the party to remain committed to leave given what it is now saying about backing remain in a pre-election referendum. Here is the key exchange with Today\u2019s Justin Webb. JW: There\u2019s a thing called logic. You can\u2019t be campaigning effectively for remain effectively before an election and then say afterwards you might change your mind. KS: Well, I accept that. There is a logic in that. We will build on the policy position that we\u2019ve got, as we always do .... JW: What I\u2019m suggesting to you is that ... the one thing that you\u2019ve decided on commits you to the second. You could not have an election where you say, \u2018Actually, you know what, we might leave anyway.\u2019 KS: Look, having got a position by consensus, and a strong and clear position, obviously we build on that as we go into a manifesto. What I can\u2019t do, Justin, is suggest that the shadow cabinet at this stage can decide what we will say in our manifesto ... Obviously a critical question is going to be when that election is. Parliament has a new group, the Independents. These are not to be be confused the independent MPs, the ones sit without party affiliation (normally because they have resigned from or been suspended by the party they were representing when elected). There are currently five Independents. Just to make things complicated, four of them - Heidi Allen, Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith - used to be members of what started life as the Independent Group before it turned into Change UK. Change UK then split when six of its 11 MPs became independents. Now four of those six are Independents. The other two were Chuka Umunna, who has joined the Lib Dems, and Sarah Wollaston, who is still an independent. The fifth Independent is John Woodcock, who used to be Labour MP before resigning in protest against Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s handling of antisemitism (although he was also suspended at the time over a harassment allegation that he strongly denied). Sir Alan Duncan, the Foreign Office minister who is backing Jeremy Hunt for the Tory leadership, has described Boris Johnson as an \u201cutter wimp\u201d because of his refusal to stand up to President Trump over the British ambassador, Kim Darroch. Matt Hancock, the health secretary who is supporting Boris Johnson for leader after his own bid failed, has been taking the Johnson line on Kim Darroch, the British ambassador to the US, in interviews this morning. He refused to say that Darroch should stay in his post, and he argued that the relationship with the US needed a \u201creset\u201d. Britain\u2019s Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate was watched by an average of 4.3m viewers, ITV has said. According to viewing figures from ITV, the debate had a peak audience of 4.7m viewers. This is from the Spectator\u2019s James Forsyth. The pro-independence National newspaper leads this morning with the fact that the union and Scotland were not discussed at all during the televised Tory leadership debate on ITV last night. After last week\u2019s plea from Theresa May \u2013 made in Scotland \u2013 to defend the union, and both Hunt and Johnson\u2019s promises on the subject, one doesn\u2019t have to be a staunch nationalist to note this omission. Elsewhere, the Herald has a fascinating read-out of Theresa May\u2019s most recent cabinet meeting which, according to UK political editor Michael Settle, discussed the threat to the union and rising support for independence at length, and concluded that extra spending was needed to promote the cause of UK unity. This is from Nikki da Costa, Theresa May\u2019s former director of legislative affairs at Downing Street. John Major was asked about this in his Today interview. He did not specifically deny calling the 1997 election a bit early to avoid the publication of a cash for questions report, but he said that by the time he did call that election, the parliament had already more or less run its full course. When Sir John Major said that a judicial review challenging the prime minister\u2019s decision to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament for a no-deal Brexit might succeed, he may have been influenced by the arguments in this Times article (paywall) by David Pannick QC. Pannick represented Gina Millar in the article 50 case and he explains why he thinks the JR route might work. Until the mid-1980s, judges decided what prerogative powers were enjoyed by the crown, but would not assess the way in which such powers were exercised. More recently, the courts have held that the legal reviewability of governmental action depends less on the nature of the power being exercised, and more on whether the grounds of review raise legal issues that the court is equipped to address ... What could be challenged is the legality of the advice on prorogation given by the prime minister. The claimant would need to show that the advice breaches a fundamental legal principle. One such principle is the sovereignty of parliament. The supreme court so held in January 2017 in the case brought by Gina Miller (for whom I acted as counsel) successfully challenging Theresa May\u2019s decision to notify the EU of Britain\u2019s intention to withdraw from membership without first seeking the approval of parliament. Whether prorogation is a breach of the constitutional principle of parliamentary sovereignty depends on the circumstances of the case. In Canada in 2008 [where parliament was prorogued for political reasons] the issue did not come to court. There would be three important features of a case in October. First, the prime minister would be seeking to prorogue parliament for the purpose of avoiding parliamentary sovereignty on an issue of significant constitutional importance. Second, he would be seeking to stop parliament sitting when time would be of the essence, given the deadline of the end of October. And third, he would be seeking to evade parliament because it has previously made clear its wish to prevent a no-deal Brexit. If he were to advise the Queen to prorogue parliament in these circumstances, the courts would be likely to hear an urgent application and then declare his advice to be unlawful. In a useful Twitter thread, starting here, the barrister Jo Maugham has compiled a list, with links, of some more articles addressing this question. The BBC\u2019s Laura Kuenssberg points out that, given where the Conservative party membership is on Brexit, John Major\u2019s threat to go to court to stop a no-deal Brexit prorogation will probably be helpful to Boris Johnson. Charlie Falconer, a former Labour lord chancellor (and that was in the days when the lord chancellor had to be a QC, not just a jobbing cabinet minister), says John Major is right to say that there would be a good case for taking a decision to prorogue parliament to avoid a no-deal Brexit to judicial review (JR). From Sky\u2019s Tamara Cohen Sir John Major has never been a fan of Boris Johnson. As a Telegraph journalist in the 1990s Johnson regularly ridiculed the Major government, and the former prime minister hasn\u2019t forgotten, or forgiven. In his Today interview this morning Major said he was supporting Jeremy Hunt for the Conservative leadership, despite some reservations (he does not agree with Hunt\u2019s willingness to accept a no-deal Brexit as an option). But Major spent most of the interview criticising Johnson, and in particular two Johnson positions that were illuminated in last night\u2019s ITV debate: Johnson\u2019s refusal to rule out the idea of proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit, and Johnson\u2019s refusal to confirm that he would keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to Washington following President Trump\u2019s declaration that he will no longer deal with Darroch. Here are the main points. Major said he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop Johnson proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit. Although proroguing is a prerogative power that is hard to challenge, Major said he thought a legal challenge was possible. In order to close down parliament, the prime minister would have to go to Her Majesty the Queen and ask for her permission to prorogue. If her first minister asks for that permission, it is almost inconceivable that the Queen will do anything other than grant it ... She is then in the midst of a constitutional controversy, that no serious politician should put the Queen in the middle of. Now, I think this is completely and utterly against parliamentary tradition, and against the way in which our government should work. If that were to happen. I think there would be a queue of people who would seek judicial review. The Queen\u2019s decision cannot be challenged in law. But the prime minister\u2019s advice to the Queen can, I believe, be challenged in law and I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed. I served in parliament for over 20 years. I\u2019m very proud to have done so. I have huge admiration for our parliamentary traditions. I\u2019m not going to stand by and see them disregarded in this fashion. It is utterly, utterly and completely the wrong way to proceed. Major said proroguing parliament to facilitate a no-deal Brexit would be \u201cutterly and totally unacceptable for any British parliamentarian or democrat\u201d. He also said it would be hypocritical from someone like Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit so that parliament could take back control. Major said: Let\u2019s strip away the jargon of proroguing and contemplate what this actually means. What it means is that a prime minister \u2013 Prime Minister Johnson, presumably \u2013 because he cannot persuade parliament to agree with his policy, will close down parliament so that he can bypass it until his policy comes into operation. Now, nobody has done that since King Charles II in the 1640s and it didn\u2019t end well for him. And it shouldn\u2019t end well. You cannot and should not bypass parliament in this fashion. And I cannot imagine how anyone could conceivably think that is right ... I seem to recall that the Brexiteers, led by Mr Johnson, actually campaigned in the referendum for the sovereignty of Parliament ... They can\u2019t be concerned for the sovereignty of Parliament except when it is inconvenient to Mr Johnson. Major said the UK government should keep Sir Kim Darroch as ambassador to the US, despite President Trump\u2019s refusal to deal with him. He defended Darroch, and said that in giving his \u201cunvarnished views\u201d about the Trump administration he was just doing his job. Major said it was unacceptable to allow foreign governments to choose the British ambassadors who should serve in their countries. Major went on: There is a secondary point that Mr Johnson and everybody else should ponder. The whole of the diplomatic service, which is vital to the interests of this country, will have seen that one of their most senior diplomats was prepared to be thrown to the wolves because of the criticism of a non-British government. I do not think that is good for the morale of the civil service. And I do not think anybody who does that will endear themselves in obtaining the loyalty of the civil service in future. Loyalty is a two-way street. Mr Darroch has not misbehaved. He has behaved exactly as he was expected to behave, indeed, probably instructed to behave. And he deserves the support of the British government. Major said the government should keep Darroch in post even if this meant a \u201cshort-term freeze\u201d in relations with Washington. If this means a short term freeze in relationships, that would be very unfortunate, because America [is] a very important ally of this country and always [has] been. But nonetheless there comes a time with principle has to come first. And the principle that we stand by our ambassadors when they have behaved entirely properly, is one that cannot be changed. In the ITV Tory leadership debate last night Boris Johnson, the clear favourite to be the next prime minister, again refused to rule out proroguing parliament to stop MPs blocking a no-deal Brexit. This morning, in an extraordinary intervention, Sir John Major, the former Conservative prime minister, told the Today programme that he would be willing to go to court to seek a judicial review to stop this happening. He said: I think the idea of proroguing parliament is utterly and totally unacceptable from any British parliamentarian or democrat. I for one would be prepared to go and seek judicial review to prevent parliament being bypassed. I will post more from Major\u2019s interview shortly. Here is the agenda for the day. 10am: David Gauke, the justice secretary, gives evidence to the Commons justice committee. 10.20am: Matt Hancock, the health secretary, gives a speech at the King\u2019s Fund\u2019s leadership and management summit. 12pm: Theresa May faces Jeremy Corbyn at PMQs. 1pm: Sir Simon McDonald, head of the Foreign Office, gives evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee about the leak of the Kim Darroch memos about the Trump White House. 1pm: David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland civil service, gives a speech to the Institute for Government. 2.30pm: Cressida Dick, commissioner of the Metropolitan police, gives evidence to the Commons home affairs committee about progress since the Macpherson report. 3.15pm: Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary and Tory leadership candidate, speaks at a conference on media freedom. As usual, I will be covering breaking political news as it happens, as well as bringing you the best reaction, comment and analysis from the web. I plan to publish a summary at lunchtime and then another when I finish. You can read all the latest Guardian politics articles here. Here is the Politico Europe roundup of this morning\u2019s political news. And here is the PoliticsHome list of today\u2019s top 10 must-reads. If you want to follow me or contact me on Twitter, I\u2019m on @AndrewSparrow. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include \u201cAndrew\u201d in it somewhere and I\u2019m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can\u2019t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter.",

It is a push that, inevitably, is for more flexibility. But as the latest annual data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force participation, mobility and job search reveals, this increased flexibility is a major driver of the current historically high levels of underemployment and the associated low wages growth.</p> <p>One of the things that is often forgotten amid the monthly unemployment rates is that, for the most part, people who are in work stay in work, and also mostly stay working at the same place. In the 12 months to February this year, fewer than 10% of all people employed changed employers \u2013 well below the record highs of the late 1980s, early 1990s:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Percentage of workers who changed jobs in the past 12 months\">  <iframe title=\"Percentage of workers who changed jobs in the past 12 months\" aria-label=\"Interactive line chart\" src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/ygU2l/1/\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"border: none;\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Not only are more of us staying with our current employers, we are staying with them for longer.

So even when times are tough, people are more likely to stay employed but on fewer hours; compared with in the past when they would have been more likely to be retrenched.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2019/mar/18/more-people-than-ever-need-a-second-job-to-help-pay-the-bills\">More people than ever need a second job to help pay the bills | Greg Jericho</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But with this flexibility has also come a much greater incidence of part-time work and underemployment.</p> <p>The increase in underemployment, however, is not because full-time workers are having their hours cut back but that part-time work as a whole has become more common. Work that was once done full-time is now on a part-time basis \u2013 and creates a much more \u201cflexible\u201d situation. But one that leaves workers desperate for more hours.</p> <p>A common misconception is that the rise in underemployment since the GFC has been due to full-time worker hours being cut. In reality fewer than 1% of full-time workers are underemployed \u2013 roughly around where it has been since 1980.</p> <p>The big driver of underemployment is the growth of part-time work.</p> <p>In 1993 a record 28.1% of all part-time workers were underemployed compared with 25.5% in 2019.

      "bodyText": "Now that the election has been won, suddenly employer groups and the government are talking up the need for industrial relations \u201creform\u201d. It is a push that, inevitably, is for more flexibility. But as the latest annual data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics on labour force participation, mobility and job search reveals, this increased flexibility is a major driver of the current historically high levels of underemployment and the associated low wages growth. One of the things that is often forgotten amid the monthly unemployment rates is that, for the most part, people who are in work stay in work, and also mostly stay working at the same place. In the 12 months to February this year, fewer than 10% of all people employed changed employers \u2013 well below the record highs of the late 1980s, early 1990s: Not only are more of us staying with our current employers, we are staying with them for longer. In the past 12 months, 45% of employees had been with the same employer for more than five years. While that is a slight fall from 2016, it remains well above the levels of 20 or 30 years ago: A big reason for this is that, since the 1980s and 1990s, industrial relations laws have become more \u201cflexible\u201d \u2013 with a much greater ability for employers to cut back on hours rather than lay off workers. So even when times are tough, people are more likely to stay employed but on fewer hours; compared with in the past when they would have been more likely to be retrenched. But with this flexibility has also come a much greater incidence of part-time work and underemployment. The increase in underemployment, however, is not because full-time workers are having their hours cut back but that part-time work as a whole has become more common. Work that was once done full-time is now on a part-time basis \u2013 and creates a much more \u201cflexible\u201d situation. But one that leaves workers desperate for more hours. A common misconception is that the rise in underemployment since the GFC has been due to full-time worker hours being cut. In reality fewer than 1% of full-time workers are underemployed \u2013 roughly around where it has been since 1980. The big driver of underemployment is the growth of part-time work. In 1993 a record 28.1% of all part-time workers were underemployed compared with 25.5% in 2019. But in 1993 those underemployed workers made up just 6.6% of all employed, whereas now they account for 8%: The reason is, in 1993 23% of all employed worked part-time, compared with 32% now. More part-time workers equals more underemployed. But this does not mean it is a meaningless issue, because since the GFC not only has part-time work been growing, so too has the underemployment of part-time workers: In 2007, 20% of men and 14% of women part-time workers were underemployed \u2013 now it is 31% and 23% respectively. Surprisingly fewer underemployed part-time workers than in the past are now hoping to go full-time, however they still remain a sizeable proportion of workers. Just under two-thirds of underemployed men were after full-time work and 49% of women: This suggests that the real remedy to underemployment is full-time work, and yet we are today in an industrial relations environment where the push from employers remains for ever-greater flexibility which inevitably leads to more part-time work. It is, however, not the only issue of labour force participation. The data shows that while there are around 1.1 million underemployed workers, there are 1.05 million people who are marginally attached to the workforce \u2013 people who are not actively looking for work but who would be able to work in the next four weeks. And yet, the reasons why they are not actively looking for work very much depend on their gender. Over a third of marginally attached men were attending some form of education; whereas the biggest activity for women was caring for children \u2013 something done by 30% of them. The activity of childcare, home duties and caring for another person with an illness or disability accounted for 56% of the work done by women marginally attached to the labour force, compared with just 16% of men: There has been actually little change in the percentage of women and men not in the labour force due to caring for children over the past 15 years: It highlights the difficulties of industrial relations policy. Greater flexibility, combined with more affordable childcare, enables more women to enter the workforce, but with greater flexibility and the incidence of part-time work comes the increase in underemployment. The issue of course is that policy designed to encourage more women into the workforce through greater flexibility inevitably is used by employers to create more part-time work and underemployment for all workers. The past decade has been a decade of underemployment; greater flexibility will not cure it. Greg Jericho writes on economics for Guardian Australia",

      "bodyText": "Australia could quickly solve the problem of Indonesia and other countries rejecting its waste if governments invested in recycling manufacturing as promised and required the use of recycled material in public projects, industry and environmental groups say. Jakarta announced on Tuesday it would return 210 tonnes of Australian household rubbish \u2013 the latest demonstration of opposition in south-east Asia to receiving exported waste. Indonesia, the Philippines and Malaysia have each turned back shipments and warned they would not become dumping grounds for developed countries after China banned imports of foreign plastic rubbish. Peter Shmigel, the head of the Australian Council of Recycling, which represents about 70 companies, said countries in the region were increasingly focused on their own waste issues and less inclined to accept it from overseas. \u201cIndonesia has not changed the level of contamination in the waste it will take, it\u2019s just enforcing the rules,\u201d he said. He said federal and state governments could address the issue by helping finance new plants and introducing procurement rules that required departments and agencies to use recycled material. He said it would kickstart a domestic recycling market that would prevent recyclable material kept in Australia sitting in stockpiles or going to landfill. About 90% of waste that does not go to landfill stays in Australia and 10% is exported. \u201cInvest and buy \u2013 they are the two big things,\u201d he said. Shmigel said one major project could be enough to make a difference to the industry. \u201cIf the federal government decided tomorrow that the 27km of roads and tunnels required for Snowy Hydro 2.0 was to be built out of recycled products you wouldn\u2019t have an export problem,\u201d he said. The Morrison government has promised a $100m recycling investment fund to support manufacturing of recycled-content products, including plastics, paper and pulp. Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and South Australia have made multimillion-dollar recycling investment pledges. Shmigel\u2019s call was backed by Jeff Angel, the director of advocacy group the Total Environment Centre. Angel said investment in glass and aluminium reprocessing plants, both new and existing, was important but did not address the biggest problem. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have the reprocessing facilities but they lack access to clean material and markets to sell their products,\u201d he said. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Angel said the success of container deposit schemes, under which people are paid for bottles and cans returned for recycling, showed a way ahead. Victoria is the only state or territory that does not have a container deposit scheme or is not promising one. \u201cThis is exactly what should be happening for a range of items that are being put in a yellow (recycling) bin,\u201d he said. The assistant minister for waste reduction and environmental management, Trevor Evans, said tackling waste was a key priority for the government, pointing to a promised $167m in investment that included developing recycling schemes for batteries, electrical and electronic products, solar systems and plastic oil containers. Evans said the government wanted to reduce waste and increase recycling to help the environment, ensure the integrity of recycling exports and promote local industries and jobs. Shmigel said the federal and state governments needed to move beyond a system of voluntary targets such as increasing recycling or composting of plastic packaging to 70% by 2025. \u201cNowhere in the world have we seen a voluntary system get to that sort of number,\u201d he said. Evans said the government had asked Indonesian authorities for further information about any concerns they have with recyclable material shipped from Australia. \u201cIf companies are breaching the rules when trading recyclables here or in Indonesia, then they are letting their industry and all Australians down, and there needs to be appropriate compliance and enforcement,\u201d Evans said.",

      "bodyText": "The outspoken government conservative Craig Kelly has warned he and other Liberal and National colleagues could \u201cactively campaign for the no side\u201d if the minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, pursues an ambitious proposal for constitutional recognition. Kelly told Guardian Australia the government would be better placed working on practical matters, such as closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, and addressing high youth suicide rates, rather than contemplating \u201ca separate body with people voting for people based on race\u201d. The Sydney Liberal said if Wyatt wanted to pursue \u201cwords in the constitution that don\u2019t really mean anything, that are symbolic, then that\u2019s fine\u201d. But if the proposal included an idea like the \u201cFirst Nations voice\u201d set out in the Uluru Statement from the Heart then that was unacceptable to him, and he predicted it would be unacceptable to like-minded Coalition colleagues. \u201cI think that idea is divisive.\u201d Kelly\u2019s intervention followed Wyatt using a major Naidoc week speech delivered at the National Press Club to put constitutional recognition back on the agenda after the election. Wyatt, the first Indigenous person to hold the portfolio, has promised to work towards holding a referendum on Indigenous recognition within three years. The articulation of a timetable follows a meeting between Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese last week in an effort to find an initial consensus. But while unveiling the three-year timetable, Wyatt made it clear he won\u2019t stick to it if the referendum looks set to fail. Wyatt used the press club speech on Wednesday to signal he wanted to persist with creating some model of the voice from the Uluru statement, but he indicated it might be legislated, rather than enshrined in the constitution, which was the position outlined in the Uluru process. He said he wanted to co-design the voice model but, when pressed for detail, he indicated it could be a structure enmeshing existing state and federal representative bodies that would provide advice to the parliament. Anticipating internal pushback within the government, he counselled fellow Indigenous leaders to be \u201cpragmatic\u201d about what could be achieved. While Labor has promised to try to land a bipartisan position, it is sticking by its recent election promise to pursue a voice enshrined in the Australian constitution. \u201cLabor has been saying clearly that we would like a voice entrenched in the Australian constitution, and I know that there are many people on the government benches that also believe that,\u201d said Linda Burney, the shadow minister for Indigenous Australians. \u201cAnd I think that is ultimately what we would want to see.\u201d Kelly said that would be a deal-breaker for him. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good strong Indigenous representation at all levels of society, and I think you want people to think they are Australians rather than belonging to any racial group,\u201d he said. He said setting up separate structures, even if the representative model was legislated rather than enshrined in the constitution, risked creating \u201ca reverse form of what South Africa was a few years ago\u201d.",

      "bodyText": "London will have a similar climate in three decades\u2019 time to that of Barcelona today, according to research \u2013 but if that seems enticing, a warning: the change could be accompanied by severe drought. Madrid will feel like present-day Marrakech by 2050, and Stockholm like Budapest, according to a report on the likely impacts of the climate crisis. Around the world, cities that are currently in temperate or cold zones in the northern hemisphere will resemble cities more than 600 miles (1,000km) closer to the equator, with damaging effects on health and infrastructure. Among other analogues, the study suggests Moscow will resemble Sofia, Seattle will feel like San Francisco and New York will be comparable to Virginia Beach. The researchers have created an interactive map showing hundreds of cities and their 2050 counterparts. Water shortages will affect scores of cities now in temperate climates as a result of the global heating, which is forecast to be by as much as 3.5C in European cities in summer and 4.7C in winter. Nearly eight in 10 cities will experience dramatic changes, according to the study of 520 major cities published in the journal Plos One. Barcelona was affected by extreme drought just over 10 years ago, endangering many inhabitants and resulting in tens of millions of euros being spent on importing drinking water. It is becoming more likely that London and cities in similar latitudes will experience the same problems in the future, say the researchers. Among the most concerning findings is that the residents of about a fifth of cities globally \u2013 including Jakarta, Singapore, Yangon and Kuala Lumpur \u2013 will experience conditions currently not seen in any major cities in the world. This unprecedented level of change \u201cblew my mind\u201d, said Tom Crowther, founder of the Crowther Lab in Switzerland, which carried out the research. \u201cThese are environmental conditions that are not experienced anywhere on the planet at the moment,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat means there will be new political challenges, new infrastructure challenges, that we have not faced before.\u201d Rainfall will be a particular problem for such cities, with extreme flooding becoming more common alongside more frequent and severe droughts. Crowther said: \u201cWe are absolutely not prepared for this. Planning for climate change needs to start yesterday. The sooner it starts, the less the impact will be.\u201d Richard Betts, a professor of climate impacts at Exeter University and head of the climate impacts strategic area at the Met Office Hadley Centre, who was not involved in the research, said: \u201cWithout the benefit of knowing that the new climate conditions are already liveable somewhere in the world, it is harder to know whether people will be able to adapt and stay in these cities, or whether they will eventually look to move elsewhere.\u201d Concern about the world\u2019s lack of preparedness for the effects of global heating is mounting among experts. Mami Mizutori, the UN secretary general\u2019s special representative on disaster risk reduction, last week told the Guardian that climate crisis disasters were happening at the rate of one a week, but that countries were not investing in making urban infrastructure more resistant. On Wednesday, the UK\u2019s Committee on Climate Change published a report saying the government was completely unprepared for the likely repercussions of the climate crisis. Its chairman, Lord Deben, compared preparations to the efforts of the ramshackle troops of the classic British comedy Dad\u2019s Army.

Also, Senegal are under fierce pressure not only to win today but to go on and win this tournament for the first time, especially after Egypt and Morocco (beaten by Benin) fell surprisingly by the wayside. What is more, thanks to the return of Benin\u2019s top striker from suspension, we can bill this clash as Steve Mouni\u00e9 v Sadio Man\u00e9. What\u2019s not to look forward to?

      "bodyText": "A second-half improvement and a lovely goal by Idrissa Gueye keeps Senegal on course for their first ever Africa Cup of Nations title. The favourites will play either Madagascar or Tunisia in the semi-final. Benin, meanwhile, bow out after a gallant tournament. They made it tough for Senegal here and were only beaten by a flash of real quality. 90+2 min: Now Mouni\u00e9 sees yellow, for brushing his marker with his hand as both jumped for the ball. Again: ridiculously harsh. 90+1 min: Man\u00e9 gets a yellow card. It\u2019s not clear what it was for, possibly handball, which would be ridiculously harsh because he knew nothing about it ricocheting off an opponent on to his arm. 90 min: The Squirrels have at least five more minutes to pull a rabbit from the hat, which looks as improbable as it sounds. Senegal substitution: San\u00e9 on, Gueye off. The Everton man took charge in the second half and showed the dynamism and quality that looks like sending his country to the semi-final. 89 min: Note: Diatta has done more since coming on than Balde has done in the whole tournament, both going forward and defensively. 87 min: A wonderful run by Man\u00e9, who has dramatically upped his game in this half, although, having said that, that run came undone when the pass at the end of it went straight to an opponent. 85 min: Diagne strokes the freekick over the five-man wall but not with the kind of power that could worry Allagb\u00e9, who saves easily. 84 min: Mane and Gueye combine brilliantly again, the Liverpool man picking out the Evertonian\u2019s bursting run from deep. Verdon pulls him down at the edge of the area and there\u2019s only one thing the referee can do about that. 82 min: Senegal don\u2019t look like letting this slip; they took the lead by cranking up the quality and they haven\u2019t dropped it since. Benin substitution: Djigla on, Soukou off. 79 min: Kouyat\u00e9 dinks a freekick into the Beninese box. Verdon ducks to let it run to the keeper, which it does despite the fact that Diagne tried to intervene. Benin substitution: Dossou on, Pot\u00e9 off. 77 min: Pandemonium in the Benin box and Senegal carve them open again and seem certain to score ... but three last-ditch clearances foil Diagne and Man\u00e9! 76 min: No goal! Man\u00e9 is deemed to have been ahead of Baraz\u00e9 when the pass was made. The Var officials must have a different angle to the one shown to me, because he looked level to me. 74 min: Man\u00e9 dashes on to a through-ball and rounds the keeper and before slotting home and wheeling away in celebration - but it is it a goal? That\u2019s for Var to decide.... 72 min: Senegal, buoyed by the opening goal, want to kill the game right now: Diatta hurtles down the right and picks out Mane with a low pass into the centre. Allagbe makes a super save to deny him, and then Mama makes an even better tackle to prevent Senegal scoring on the rebound! Senegal show their class at last and help themselves to a brilliant goal! Gueye started it by fizzing a pass from midway to Man\u00e9 near the D, then dashing forward for the return ball, which Man\u00e9 provided. And Gueye crowned it with a sharp finish! Benin substitution: Mama on, D\u2019Almeida off - he must be tired, otherwise there was no case to bring him off. 66 min: Sabalay rolls the ball back to Gomis, who takes his eye off it and, in trying to stroke it to another defender, shanks a kick ridiculously close to his own goal! When he sees it spins just wide of his post he thanks his lucky stars, and apologises to his teammates! In a way, that would have been a suitable way for Seengal to go out, as they just haven\u2019t been truly at it and far far below the sum of their parts. Senegal substitution: Diatta on, Balde off. It had to be done. 65 min: Koulibaly plays another good pass over the top for Sabalay, who scampers down the left and into the box but then blazes a wild cross to nowhere useful. Senegal substitution: Diagne on, Niang goes off on a stretcher, seemingly after incurring some manner of muscle strain. 61 min: D\u2019Almeida, who has been very lively throughout but especially in thes second half, nicks the ball off Gueye and then gets accidentally clobbered by the Everton midfielder. That gives Benin a freekick in a very useful crossing position to the right o the Senegalese box. Soukou\u2019s delivery is good. Verdon gets up well but can\u2019t keep his header down, nodding over the bar from 10 yards. 60 min: Olivier Verdon, who is wearing No6 and has \u201cOV6\u201d shaved into the side of his head just in case he forgets who he is, is penalised for an awkward tackle about 23 yards from his goal. Saivet steps up to take the freekick ... and curls it high and wide. 58 min: Some swish play by Senegal! They raised the tempo of their passing and suddenly looked much sharper. Mane produced a touch of class to help a fizzed pass on to Niang, whose first touch near the penalty spot was good, but Adilehou made a tremendous tackle to stop him getting off a shot. 56 min: Sabaly chips a cross to no one. 54 min: Saivet delivers another dangerous freekick. Koulibaly flicks it on and Man\u00e9 finishes with a close-range nod into the net! Senegla have the breakthrough! Except. no, they don\u2019t! Because Mane was offside - not when the freekick was taken, but when Koulibaly helped it on. The officials, in fairness, didn\u2019t need Var to get that right. 52 min: D\u2019Almeida robs the ball off Man\u00e9 in midfield. AM I right that Yeovil let this lad go at the end of last season? 50 min: From out by the right-hand touchline Saivet sends in an inviting freekick. Niang tries to chest it into the net from 10 yards. It has neither the power nor the accuracy to bother keeper. Why he eschewed the diving header there, I\u2019ve no idea. 48 min: Beautiful play by Soukou down the right. After nutmegging a defender he races down the ring and sends a low cross towards Mouni\u00e9, who is coming on to it at high speed near the penalty area. He fails to make a proper connection but the ball runs through to Pot\u00e9, who takes it under control and tries to guide a low curler past the keeper from 16 yards, but he doesn\u2019t catch it very cleanly and Gomis gets down to make a comfortable save. In summary, brilliant by Gomis, not so hot from Benin\u2019s forwards. 47 min: D\u2019Almeida gets back to intercept a pass from Man\u00e9. Moments later the Yeovil man joins an attack and tries to finish it in style, letting fly from 25 yards with an efforts that whistles past the post. 46 min: Mouni\u00e9 starts the second half... Benin will be satisfied with that: Senegal had most of the ball but seldom looked like doing anything with it, while Benin threatened on rare counter-attacks, especially from setpieces. The Squirrels can fancy their chances of nicking this! The favourites need to improve big time by moving themselves and the ball faster and smarter. 45+1 min: More snappy play from Senegal - that narrow escape a few minutes ago has perked them right up! Except Niang, apparently, because he gets the ball stuck at his feet after being presented with it in the box. Benin converge on him and clear. 45 min: Koulibably unlocks the Benin defence with another fine ball from deep. Sabaly takes it down on the left and looks up to see Mane free in the centre, begging for a tap-in! But Sabaly\u2019s pass is dreadful, straight to the backtracking Verdon, who clears gratefully! 44 min: Soukou is aghast to be booked after winning the ball via a fine sliding tackle on Ndiaye, after which he got up and blasted into the net from the edge of the area. Soukou\u2019s baffled anger is understandable: I don\u2019t think that was a foul, let alone a bookable offence! Senegal are lucky to be level. 42 min: One cute pass from Gueye aside, there is no creative quality coming from Senegal\u2019s midfield. Man\u00e9 and Balde are having to make do with raking long balls from the back, chiefly from Koulibaly. There\u2019s a sad lack of inspiration from them, and Benin have been comfortable for most of the match despite having less possession. 40 min: Man\u00e9 battles and tricks his way past three players down the left and then sneaks the ball through to Gueye, who overhits his cross. 38 min: A sharp move down the left by Senegal, led by Balde and then given a dangerous injection by Gueye, who flipped a lovely pass through to Niang. The striker shows tidy feet to trick his way past one and then goes down under a challenge by Adeoti. He looks to the ref for a penalty but nothing doing. Good decision. 36 min: Senegal pounce on a bit of sloppiness in midfield by Benin and then hurtle forward, enticed by a rare gap in Benin\u2019s defence. But then Senegalese players get in their own way and offer Benin a chance to recover. The chances evaporates. 34 min: Adeoti takes a Senegalese clearance down on his chest and then swats the bouncing ball with his right foot at goal from over 25 yards. It\u2019s an elegant try but Gomis isn\u2019t about to let it go past him and makes a comfortable catch. 32 min: Saivet produces a vicious delivery from a deep freekick from the left, whipping it over the last defender. Koulibaly does his best to try to get a decisive touch on it but just misses. 31 min: Mouni\u00e9 is playing the lone frontman role very well here. He\u2019s everywhere, showing his strength, nimble footwork and intelligence by winning and holding up the ball and bringing teammates into play. 30 min: That\u2019s better from Senegal! Man\u00e9, barely involved in the last while, takes down a long ball and then stabs a cute pass through towards Niang. But the keeper charged off his line to claim it before the striker. 29 min: The threat from Benin is growing and Senegal\u2019s reaction is not impressive - they are looking downright sluggish. When Benin play their way in down the left, Senegal are lucky that Soukou does not realise how much time and space he has in the box, as he tries to pick out a poorly placed teammates when he had a clear sight of goal himself. 27 min: Soukou curls a low freekick into the danger zone. Pot\u00e9 tries to flick it into the net from seen yards, but it flies just wide! So close to the strike against the run of play that Benin are counting on. 26 min: Kouyat\u00e9 is adjudged, rather harshly, to have pushed over Soukou just outside the left-hand corner of the Senegalese box. A chance for Benin, then ... 24 min:As a sign of Benin\u2019s rising ambition - or lack of options going forward - Soukou has a pop from 30 yards. It trickles a few yards wide. 23 min: Saivet swings in a corner from the left. Mouni\u00e9 heads it to safety. 21 min: Souku sends a long freekick from the right into the mixer. Mouni\u00e9 challenges for it with Gomis, and, inevitably, the referee blows for a foul against the keeper. We\u2019ve heard more of the whistle than of the djembes so far. This really is a punctilious official. 19 min: Benin have enjoyed a little more possession in the last couple of minutes. They\u2019ll be happy with the start to this game, as although Senegal have had most of the play, there has been little threat. 17 min: The referee inadvertently blocks a pass by Adeoti and then blows the whistle to stop play and give the ball back to Benin. 15 min: On a rare venture into Senegalese territory, Adeoti draws a foul from Gueye. It\u2019s mid-way inside the Senegalese half and it comes to nothing. 13 min: A nice one-two twixt Man\u00e9 and Niang works a shooting opportunity for the Liverpool man; the keeper smothers his close-range shot well before looking up to see if needn\u2019t have bothered, because Man\u00e9 was offside. It\u2019s all Senegal. 11 min: Sabaly\u2019s cross from the left takes a deflection and forces the keeper into a quick readjustment at the near post. He gathers it safely at the second attempt. 9 min: Koulibaly drops a ball from the centre circle over the top of the Benin defence and into the path of Man\u00e9, who bent his run smartly before taking the ball down on his chest at the edge of the area. But two Benin defenders react quickly to bundle him away. 7 min: Verdon beats Mane to a pass into the right-hand channel and puts it out for a throw-in near the corner flag. Senegal take it quickly and Gassama tries to wriggle into space for a cross but has to settle for a corner. Saviet will deliver again: will Pot\u00e9 go for it after the fearful blow he copped when clearing the last one? No need, because Saviet couldn\u2019t get it past the first man. 6 min: Pot\u00e9 returns to the action and goes straight back into defensive mode as Benin continue trying to fend off Senegal, who are probing patiently. 4 min: As Pot\u00e9 is taken off on a stretcher - seemingly indicating that he will be able to return - the Senegalese fans in the sparsely populated stadium play their djembes and dance in unison. 3 min: Senegal have taken the initiative from the start and are playing very much in the Beninese half. Their first corner is delivered towards the near post by Saivet. Pot\u00e9 does well to get to to it before Koulibaly and then clashes heads with the defender. It looked painful and he needs treatment. 1 min: A blast of the referee\u2019s whistle is the signal for Senegal to get the game going. That official, by the way, is Moutapha Ghorbal of Algeria, who also took of charge of Senegal\u2019s win over Uganda in the last round: he has a decidedly inconsistent approach that day, dishing out very severe bookings but then deciding against giving a second to the Ugandan keeper after a blatant sending-off offence, which meant Onyango remained on the pitch to save a penalty from Mane. It\u2019ll be interesting to see, on that note, whether the Liverpool man will take one today if Senegal get one, as he has missed three out of four attempts at the Afcon. It\u2019s national anthem time and the players of each country to their duty with gusto. The winners of this match will face either Madagascar or Tunisia. Isn\u2019t it wonderful that it is not completely absurd to envisage an Africa Cup of Nations semi-final between Benin and Madagascar? After a group stages and round of 16 featuring good old-fashioned refereeing fiascos, this match is the first at this tournament that will have the dubious benefit of Var. Let\u2019s see if Caf can handle it rather better than they did during this year\u2019s African Champions League final, which ended prematurely (or not at all, given that the matter may still be decided in court) amid a kinghell ruckus involving a lot of bad-mouthing, finger-wagging and an alleged headbutt. Aliou Ciss\u00e9 has made just one change to the lineup that ground out a functional win over Uganda in the last round: Keita Balde comes in for the injured Sarr. That means M\u2019baye Niang continues up front, presumably on the basis that the law of averages alone suggests he can\u2019t have yet another blunt game. At last Mouni\u00e9\u2019s lack of goals have been down to (mostly) inadequate service. Might today be the day when one of the strikers ends their barren spell in decisive style? Senegal: Gomis, Gassama, Koulibaly, Kouyat\u00e9, Sabaly; Gueye, Ndiaye, Saivet; Balde, Niang, Mant\u00e9, Niang Benin: Allagb\u00e9; Baraze, Verdon, Imorou, Adilehou; Adeoti, D\u2019Almeida, Pot\u00e9, Soukou; Sessesgon; Mouni\u00e9 Referee: M Ghorbal (Algeria) Hello, it\u2019s quarter-final time in the Africa Cup of Nations and if you expected Benin to be here, you\u2019re a genius or a fool. The Squirrels had never won match at the tournament before this year \u2013 and they still haven\u2019t, yet here they are in the last eight. And deservedly so! There\u2019s little to suggest they have the ability to oust a solid, star-studded but not yet spectacular Senegal team, other than the fact that they\u2019ve proven cussedly hard to beat so far, they work their socks off and they do have a sprinkling of quality. Also, Senegal are under fierce pressure not only to win today but to go on and win this tournament for the first time, especially after Egypt and Morocco (beaten by Benin) fell surprisingly by the wayside. What is more, thanks to the return of Benin\u2019s top striker from suspension, we can bill this clash as Steve Mouni\u00e9 v Sadio Man\u00e9. What\u2019s not to look forward to? It\u2019s on!",

      "bodyText": "Peers have overseen a culture of harassment and bullying in the House of Lords which has been hidden because staff fear reprisals, according to an official report released on Wednesday. One in five members of staff in the upper house say they have experienced bullying or harassment, a seven month inquiry conducted by Naomi Ellenbogen QC has discovered. Recommendations for the House of Lords include the installation of CCTV in harassment \u201chotspots\u201d around the upper chamber, training for peers and a new head of the Lords to oversee any allegations which might arise. It follows high-profile cases when peers including the Lib Dem Lord Lester have been found to have abused their position to sexually harass or abuse women. According to the 132 page report, the prevailing culture and behaviours in the House of Lords have not been conducive to an open and supportive culture. \u201cStaff have bullied and harassed other staff. Members have bullied and harassed staff. \u201cOn the whole, staff who have experienced bullying and harassment have tended not to complain, formally or otherwise, in the belief that nothing will happen and/or for fear of reprisal,\u201d it concludes. The report revealed that a staff survey last year found unprecedented levels of abuse towards staff. \u201cAt 20%, the level of reported experience of bullying/harassment (excluding sexual harassment) is 9% points higher than across the civil service and marginally higher than the House of Commons (+2% points),\u201d it read. The report made 19 recommendations, which include installing CCTV in two areas where peers have been accused of abusing staff, particularly late at night \u2013 the library and in the tables office where peers can put down questions for ministers. Others include improving peers\u2019 behaviour with high-quality training and appointing a director general. Ellenbogen said cultural issues in the Lords have enabled abusive behaviour to \u201cflourish over a sustained period\u201d. She wrote there existed in the House of Lords \u201ca culture of undue deference, fear and hierarchy that has put members and clerks at the top, and everyone else below\u201d. According to the report, that meant \u201cstaff can become institutionalised, bad habits can become entrenched, poor behaviour can go unchecked, urban myths can develop and beliefs which may once have been justified can survive and flourish when no longer warranted.\u201d There are currently 778 members of the House of Lords excluding 22 members who are currently not eligible to participate in its work.

      "bodyText": "Liverpool\u2019s Champions League hero Divock Origi has ended doubts over his future by signing a long-term contract. The Belgium international, who sealed Liverpool\u2019s sixth European Cup triumph against Tottenham in June and their place in the final, signed the extension following several months of negotiation. Origi\u2019s deal does not contain a release clause and completes a remarkable turnaround for the striker under J\u00fcrgen Klopp. Liverpool were open to offers for the 24-year-old last summer and in January but were unable to secure their asking price for a player who spent the 2017-18 season on loan at Wolfsburg. His attitude and work rate in training earned another opportunity under Klopp last season, however, and the forward repaid his manager with late winners against Everton and Newcastle as well as his contribution in the Champions League. Origi, who had entered the final year of his contract and had attracted interest from Real Betis this summer, is scheduled to feature in the team\u2019s first pre-season friendly at Tranmere on Thursday.",

      "body": "<p>The chief of Britain\u2019s Foreign Office does nothing casually. He is a past master at saying nothing unintended in public. So when the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald, went before MPs this lunchtime after the devastating resignation of Britain\u2019s Washington ambassador, Kim Darroch, his incisive directness was a revelation. It was the most eloquent evidence possible that the Darroch affair is not just a diplomatic storm but an existential challenge to Britain\u2019s entire foreign policy.</p> <p>What precedent was there, the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat asked McDonald straight off, for the head of state of a friendly government to do what Donald Trump has done this week and make it impossible for Britain\u2019s senior representative in that country to do his job? McDonald\u2019s answer was monosyllabic, crisp and explosive. \u201cNone,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/08/kim-darroch-trump-uk-ambassador-us\">How can Kim Darroch represent Britain in Trump\u2019s Washington now? | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant followed up. Surely there were precedents from unfriendly countries such as Venezuela? \u201cI know of none,\u201d McDonald replied again. Not even hostile states have behaved like Trump, he insisted. Had there been some distant occasion when a British ambassador fell foul of the White House in such a way? There was, McDonald admitted, a \u201cdifficulty\u201d in 1856, when President Franklin Pierce accused the British ambassador of recruiting Americans to fight in the Crimean war. The listeners in committee room 16 laughed, but McDonald did not.</p> <p>And then came in many ways the most extraordinary remark of the lot. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d McDonald told another MP. \u201cThere must be consequences. What they are in detail I can\u2019t tell you this afternoon.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ve known McDonald a long time. He was in the Washington embassy when the Guardian posted me there during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Later, he worked for foreign secretary Jack Straw back in London. More recently he has been Britain\u2019s ambassador in Berlin and is an authoritative analyst of German politics and policy. For the past four years he has been the head of the diplomatic service in London.</p> <p>McDonald is emphatically not an old-school British diplomat. He is a bit of an outsider, modern, approachable and fiercely loyal to his staff and colleagues. Getting a story out of McDonald is one of the hardest journalistic tasks I have encountered. I\u2019ve never heard him talk in public the way he did yesterday. It tells you that this is really serious. He is not just angry: he\u2019s looking into the abyss into which the British postwar worldview is sliding.</p> <p>Darroch was brought down by three people. The first was the leaker of successive critical memos from the Washington embassy, who gave them to one of Britain\u2019s most effective pro-Brexit journalists.

      "bodyText": "The chief of Britain\u2019s Foreign Office does nothing casually. He is a past master at saying nothing unintended in public. So when the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald, went before MPs this lunchtime after the devastating resignation of Britain\u2019s Washington ambassador, Kim Darroch, his incisive directness was a revelation. It was the most eloquent evidence possible that the Darroch affair is not just a diplomatic storm but an existential challenge to Britain\u2019s entire foreign policy. What precedent was there, the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat asked McDonald straight off, for the head of state of a friendly government to do what Donald Trump has done this week and make it impossible for Britain\u2019s senior representative in that country to do his job? McDonald\u2019s answer was monosyllabic, crisp and explosive. \u201cNone,\u201d he said. Labour\u2019s Chris Bryant followed up. Surely there were precedents from unfriendly countries such as Venezuela? \u201cI know of none,\u201d McDonald replied again. Not even hostile states have behaved like Trump, he insisted. Had there been some distant occasion when a British ambassador fell foul of the White House in such a way? There was, McDonald admitted, a \u201cdifficulty\u201d in 1856, when President Franklin Pierce accused the British ambassador of recruiting Americans to fight in the Crimean war. The listeners in committee room 16 laughed, but McDonald did not. And then came in many ways the most extraordinary remark of the lot. \u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d McDonald told another MP. \u201cThere must be consequences. What they are in detail I can\u2019t tell you this afternoon.\u201d I\u2019ve known McDonald a long time. He was in the Washington embassy when the Guardian posted me there during Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency. Later, he worked for foreign secretary Jack Straw back in London. More recently he has been Britain\u2019s ambassador in Berlin and is an authoritative analyst of German politics and policy. For the past four years he has been the head of the diplomatic service in London. McDonald is emphatically not an old-school British diplomat. He is a bit of an outsider, modern, approachable and fiercely loyal to his staff and colleagues. Getting a story out of McDonald is one of the hardest journalistic tasks I have encountered. I\u2019ve never heard him talk in public the way he did yesterday. It tells you that this is really serious. He is not just angry: he\u2019s looking into the abyss into which the British postwar worldview is sliding. Darroch was brought down by three people. The first was the leaker of successive critical memos from the Washington embassy, who gave them to one of Britain\u2019s most effective pro-Brexit journalists. The second was President Trump, who followed up on the leaks with a fusillade of personal insults and punitive actions of his own which brought Darroch to the brink. And the third was Boris Johnson, who knowingly refused to express confidence in Darroch during Tuesday\u2019s ITV leadership hustings with Jeremy Hunt. It was Johnson\u2019s action that led directly to Darroch\u2019s inevitable resignation today. Each of these requires us to pause and digest the implications. First, consider the leaker. This must have been either a senior insider \u2013 a politician or diplomat \u2013 with access to highly classified material. Alternatively, it may have been an outside job, a hack or intercept, possibly by the agent of a state bent on mischief. Either way, these options are devastating for the practicality of diplomatic cables in the modern era. They are a reminder too of the extent to which Brexit subverts the workings of the British state. There\u2019s been nothing like it for alternative loyalty since the Soviet spies of the cold-war era.

The reality is that the benefits of EU membership have been secured because we have a voice in the EU\u2019s institutions \u2013 leading, shaping and influencing, and making the case for strategic priorities like the regional investment Conn is right to highlight.

      "bodyText": "Here we go again (Letters, 10 July). What the much misquoted Sir Henry Wotton, whose portrait used in my day to hang in the permanent under-secretary\u2019s room, actually said in his aphorism (though without my added italics) was to define an ambassador as \u201can honest man sent to lie abroad for the good of his country\u201d. But, living as he did in the 16th/17th centuries, he didn\u2019t think it necessary to add, \u201cJoke: lie abroad also means to live overseas.\u201d It was only later, when he unwisely turned his witticism into a Latin version which lost the pun, that he ran into trouble, but the trouble was with his own King James, who took offence at even an imputation of deliberate dishonesty in his dealings with his fellow rulers. As my wife expostulated at the breakfast table, even on the distorted version of Wotton, it\u2019s the other side with whom you\u2019re being less than candid, not your own.

      "bodyText": "That\u2019s it then! A great round, and thanks for sticking with us while all the excitement was going on at Old Trafford. What a buzz for the Black Caps - and my little nephew and niece Winston and Kitty over in Auckland. (Gives an over the top embarrassing auntie wave.) Well done to Lancs who knuckled down to vault back up to the top of the table. Surrey now have a stinkingly-huge game against Notts, while Durham and Derby can play promotion poker. Thanks for all the emails and messages. It\u2019ll be Graham on Saturday and I\u2019ll see you all Sunday for the last three days of the last round before the slap and tickle starts in time for the summer holidays. Have a lovely evening. Good night. At last. Some nice batting practice that for Lancs - fifties for Hameed, Davies, Bohannon and Vilas. Northants did everything right, but didn\u2019t couldn\u2019t find the pepper on the final afternoon. Lancashire hop back up to the top of Division Two. Just popped back to say nothing doing at Wantage Road. Bohannon and Vilas still there 231-4. Here\u2019s the Hass wicket mentioned BTL. The boy got fifty though. Give him time. All well still at Wantage Road. Vilas accompanying Bohannon who has made fifty. Lancs 206-4. Hass is out for fifty. Lancs are four down. And that should be that .. unless... That was quick! Leicester lost the last three wickets in ten balls for three runs. Raine finishes with 5-47, and nine in the match. Well batted Cosgrove and Azad. Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) and 263-9 dec (Keogh 74) v Lancashire 315 (Davies 147; Sanderson 4-62) and 165-3 (Davies 53, Hameed 52 not out not). LANCASHIRE NEED 226 TO WIN. Some Lancs news: Allrounder George Balderstone will lead the England U-19s this summer in the series against India and Bangladesh. Here is the full squad: George Balderson (Lancashire, captain) Kasey Aldridge (Somerset) Ben Charlesworth (Gloucestershire) Tom Clark (Sussex) Jordan Cox (Kent) Blake Cullen (Middlesex) Joey Evison (Nottinghamshire) Lewis Goldsworthy (Somerset) Jack Haynes (Worcestershire) George Hill (Yorkshire) Nick Kimber (Nottinghamshire) Dominic Leech (Yorkshire) Jack Morley (Lancashire) Daniel Mousley (Warwickshire) Hamidullah Qadri (Derbyshire) James Taylor (Derbyshire) Any takers for Lancs v Northants and Leicester v Durham? The back door just slammed, I\u2019ll take that as a yes. Dearden and Griffiths clinging on for dear life at Grace Road. And Lancs coasting, actually, Hass is creeping towards a small bat raise. A brave effort by Worcestershire but well done Derby! Four wickets for Ravi Rampaul, and three each for Hudson-Prentice and Palladino. Derby\u2019s third win of the season as they pull their promotion pants on. Worcestershire have now gone six games without a win - a barren mid-season by the team many thought would bounce back up to Division One. The Rs are having a field day at Grace Road: three for Raine, three for Rimmington (good day for him too) and one for Rushworth. Durham in tickling distance. Leicester 238-7. A good effort by Surrey, but Morkel\u2019s early burst wasn\u2019t enough. It was Kent\u2019s third win of the season. An unbeaten 51 for Ollie Robinson including a six to win the match. Kent lie fifth, Surrey are sixth, three points beneath. Jones has gone at Wantage Road, but Hass is still there. Unlike Bhuvneshwar. And that\u2019s it for India I think . And in the big game, Kent need 14 to win. A wicket at The Oval - Kuhn caught by Clarke off Batty for 22. Kent 99-5 need 22 to win. And the 200 comes up for India... I think people\u2019s attention may be elsewhere.... but in case you\u2019re still here: Kent need 29 - nailed on. six wickets in hand. Worcs need 102. Dodgy. three wickets in hand Leics need 187. Unlikely. six wickets in hand Lancashire need 283. Not going to happen. eight wickets in hand. Just so you know: It\u2019s getting tasty at OT....and a letter about India has arrived at CCLive!! I am reading the Guardian and watching India go down to the Kiwis. Poor batting by the Indians apart, the New Zealander\u2019s reading of the game and the Indians batting weaknesses decided the outcome. Kohli\u2019s overlong honeymoon has finally ended. Looking forward to your analysis. Best. JP Murty My analysis: keep the telly on! But do keep half an eye on English county cricket too - so glad to have some international readers. A third for Hudson-Prentice at Kidderminster - and it\u2019s Ferguson for 127 -what a debut match he\u2019s having! Six wickets so far and joint highest scorer in the first innings. Worcs seven down need another 120. Unlikely, me thinks. Three now for Ben Raine as Durham chip away. Leicestershire 178 for four. Is it time for a Rushworth moment? Sam Curran waves that magic bowling arm and Bell-Drummond too is gone. Kent 60-4 - 61 to win. Division One The Oval: Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) and 218 (Elgar 65; Stevens 5-60,, Milnes 4-61) v Kent 369 (Denly 88) and 40-3 (Morkel 2-15). KENT NEED 81 TO WIN. Division Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 212 (Horton 50, Ackermann 62 not out; Raine 4-49, Rushworth 5-55) and 160-3 (Azad 55 not out) v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) and 487-7dec (Bancroft 109, Lees 93, Rimmington 92) LEICESTER NEED 233 TO WIN. Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) and 263-9 dec (Keogh 74) v Lancashire 315 (Davies 147; Sanderson 4-62) and 74-1 (Davies 51 not out). LANCASHIRE NEED 317 TO WIN. Kidderminster: Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) and 245-6 (Ferguson 126 not out, Cox 62) v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 377 (Lace 132 not out; Barnard 4-48). WORCESTERSHIRE NEED 128 TO WIN. I think this is called shooting yourself in the foot. Sean Dickson and Daniel Bell-Drummond have steadied the ship and raised a hand to the horizon where land is just coming into sight. 82 needed. And apologies - comments don\u2019t seem to be working at the moment. My non-technical guess is that the system has gone under due to the number of people trying to log onto the OBO. The tech-supremos are trying to fix it asap. Oh my, Pant has gone. India 71/5. At Wantage Road, Jennings is out. But for 20 - which is considerably better than his last few outings. Hass joins Davies (36 not out). I don\u2019t know if anyone below the line is an expert on organising big events ? I was reading George Dobell\u2019s piece on Edgbaston and ticketing. Have ICC really been so bad? They\u2019ve created a ticketing return service to try and stop people selling and buying at prohibitive cost on the black market. They can\u2019t fundamentally change human nature or alter the fact that more Indian supporters bought tickets than England supporters. Or have I missed something?I love the idea of leaving a certain amount of tickets to be sold on the day - but I suppose that too could leave empty seats. Dolly has hit two fours in his ten not out, suggesting the spirit of last week is still with him. Worcs only need 145. This could happen, couldn\u2019t it? My money is on Darren Stevens to hit the winning runs at The Oval. (Kent 5/2). Meanwhile Leicestershire are three down, but Azad is providing his usual sturdiness at the top of the innings - 45 off 102 balls. Leicester need another 262 to win. Um. Kent? 0/2 before the end of the first over. Morkel\u2019s got Crawley and Denley. This was an instance when it wasn\u2019t the right idea to copy India. Here are the first three WC wickets FYI. It would have been a brave man to tell Kohli not to bother to review that lbw. And Surrey are all out - Kent need 121 to win. Softly, softly should do it. Though beware Sam Curran. Stevens 5-60; Milnes 4-61. A hundred for Callum Ferguson! Well played! But Cox is just out, b Rampaul for 62. A partnership of 164. Can anyone stay with Ferguson? Worcs need 161 to win - four wickets left. A breakthrough at Grace Road, Wright lbw to Raine for 34. Leicestershire 97-2. Rikki Clarke is out after a boundary-laden 31. To Stevens of course. Surrey 212-8, a lead of 114. Incidentally I\u2019d missed that Babar Azam was coming to Taunton for the T20 Blast. Lay down the plastic sheeting - Northants have declared at 263-9. Lancashire need 391 to win. Sorry, where were we? Ah... yes, I\u2019ve got an email from our old CCLive friend Finbar who is now in Jerusalem. I\u2019m just by the wailing wall which is pretty amazing, talking of which what about Somerset? I just have a slight feeling of unease about our weakness when it comes to batting points; or do you think having four bowlers in the county statistics top ten more than compensates? I\u2019d agree their batting is a bit dodgy - though usually someone stands up in every innings - like Azhar Ali\u2019s 65 yesterday. They\u2019re missing an in-form Trescothick or a banker like Matt Renshaw last year. There are proper Somerset followers BTL who I\u2019m sure will have their thoughts. 5-3?????? This tweet suggests I should take a look at the OBO: And a couple of wickets down at Northants I see, the overnight batsmen Procter and Hutton snared by Parry and Bohannon. They might want to think twice about doing that. Sammy Curran done by Darren Stevens, who has now got four for 48. What is his secret? Dibbly-dobblies always on target? Secret swing? People underestimating him for a jolly middle-aged estate agent? Surrey 191-7, a lead of 93. Here is Vic\u2019s match report of what went on yesterday And another lovely column from Moeen Ali, who speaks very highly of his teammates. Division One The Oval: Surrey 271-9dec (Elgar 63, Foakes 60) and 179-6 (Elgar 65; Stevens 4-46) v Kent 369 (Denly 88). SURREY LEAD BY 81. Division Two Grace Road: Leicestershire 212 (Horton 50, Ackermann 62 not out; Raine 4-49, Rushworth 5-55) and 58-1 v Durham 117 (Wright 5-30) and 487-7dec (Bancroft 109, Lees 93, Rimmington 92) LEICESTER NEED 335 TO WIN. Wantage Road: Northamptonshire 442 (Bavuma 103; Onions 5-77) and 214-6 (Keogh 74) v Lancashire 315 (Davies 147; Sanderson 4-62). NORTHANTS LEAD BY 341. Kidderminster: Worcestershire 113 (Reece 4-30) and 156-5 (Ferguson 71 not out, Cox 44 not out) v Derbyshire 108 (Morris 4-26) and 377 (Lace 132 not out; Barnard 4-48). WORCESTERSHIRE NEED 217 TO WIN. Hello everyone! Hope you had time to cut your nails, the pencils are sharpened and yesterday\u2019s soup can be turned into today\u2019s pasta sauce. I can report that my washing that got soaked during Manchester\u2019s extended shower yesterday is now drying - so the World Cup semi-final should continue on its merry way.

Yet the reality can be far more diffuse. Think of the terrorist attack by Darren Osborne on the Finsbury Park mosque, or the shootings in Christchurch. They were committed by people whose relationship with the far right was forged almost exclusively online. Indeed, Osborne was said to have been radicalised in just three weeks, before he rammed a van into the London mosque, killing one and injuring at least nine more.</p> <p>It is this subset of the far right that is explored in The Left Behind, which launches today on the BBC. Created by the team behind the Bafta-winning dramas Murdered by My Father and Killed by My Debt, The Left Behind follows the descent of a young working-class man into extremist ideology. Gethin (played by rising Welsh actor Sion Daniel Young) isn\u2019t marching around town squares in crusader garb, but becomes sympathetic to the same worldview \u2013 a situation that culminates in him carrying out a horrifying hate crime.</p> <p>The rise of far-right activity in the UK is staggering, with a 36% increase in the number of extremists referred to the government\u2019s counter-terrorism programme Prevent in 2018. With this surge has come increased public awareness, yet for all the column inches and documentaries dedicated to the issue, the team behind The Left Behind felt little was being done to understand what is actually causing it. \u201cAs a country, we tend to either demonise this problem or ignore it,\u201d Harris says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"44646380cee0bfa4873ef4a1cc505ae99e6eccb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/44646380cee0bfa4873ef4a1cc505ae99e6eccb1/0_130_4285_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gethin (Sion Daniel Young).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life is \u2018absolutely hopeless\u2019 \u2026 Gethin (Sion Daniel Young).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Ridgway/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They sought to create a drama that dug into the roots of far-right extremism, using literature from Hope Not Hate and speaking to Prevent consultants and academics.

He works at a chicken shop in an unnamed south Wales town on a zero-hours contract, and lives with his sister, her partner and their child. (His mother is dead and his father is homeless.) Affordable accommodation is at a premium, and Gethin and his sister bristle when a Muslim family is housed ahead of them. Gethin gets close to their daughter, yet as his situation worsens his anti-immigrant sentiment grows, fuelled by social media posts full of spurious \u201cfacts\u201d and violent language. Things come to a head when Gethin and his friends, wearing pig masks, carry out an Islamophobic attack on his new neighbour\u2019s halal butcher shop. Then things get darker still \u2026</p> <p>\u201cThis is a historical narrative about working-class people \u2013 that when top-down pressure comes at them, they have nowhere to turn but each other,\u201d says Lisa McKenzie, a sociologist focusing on class inequality. To McKenzie, the film conveys the \u201cabsolute hopelessness\u201d of life at the sharp end of austerity Britain, but she is concerned that its somewhat sympathetic outlook towards Gethin\u2019s situation will anger some. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost context and nuance. People will pick sides,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Are the creators similarly concerned? Certainly Gethin is at times almost a likeable figure, compassionate towards his family and quietly charismatic. Yet when he does turn fully towards extremism it feels unequivocal: there is a desensitised look in his eyes when he commits his final, fateful act.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to write characters you don\u2019t agree with sometimes but you do care about,\u201d Harris says. \u201cAnd to get an effective drama across, these can\u2019t be two-dimensional, easily dismissed characters.

I think people want answers \u2013 and at the moment, the status quo isn\u2019t providing answers.

It soon becomes clear, though, that the commitment might not be as cast-iron as it first seemed. As the councillor spins and blurts out soundbites, her constituents get angrier and angrier.

      "body": "<p>Freddie Jones, who has died aged 91, was the best sort of old-fashioned actor, a comic tragedian, eccentric and full-hearted, with something of both Donald Wolfit and Dickens\u2019 Vincent Crummles about him. Indeed, his most famous stage role was that of Ronald Harwood\u2019s affectionate near-portrait of Wolfit in The Dresser (1980), an old ham called \u201cSir\u201d who faces disaster in the mirror while preparing to play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/king-lear\" title=\"\">King Lear</a>. And he memorably embodied the extravagant Crummles in a television <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/23/charles-dickens-favourite-nicholas-nickleby\" title=\"\">Nicholas Nickleby</a> of 1977.</p> <p>If Jones sometimes emulated Wolfit, his real hero was Wilfrid Lawson, a bibulous character actor who could break your heart on the instant, and he always welcomed the comparison. Yet, to the general public, he was never a name in lights, his career was patchwork and he suffered the indignity of outright failure in a role that should have been a triumph, Malvolio in Twelfth Night, when he returned to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rsc\" title=\"\">Royal Shakespeare Company</a> in 1991, three decades after his debut in 1962.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"457b1eaa2f5585c53d5e41a0035ab3c4fa4f9a0c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/457b1eaa2f5585c53d5e41a0035ab3c4fa4f9a0c/0_912_3536_2120/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freddie Jones and Tom Courtenay, left, in The Dresser at the Queen\u2019s theatre, London, in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freddie Jones and Tom Courtenay, left, in The Dresser at the Queen\u2019s theatre, London, in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Muir/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, he achieved a recognition of sorts as <a href=\"https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-02-16/emmerdale-sandy-thomas-leaves-freddie-jones-actor-itv/\" title=\"\">Sandy Thomas</a>, the estranged father of a vicar, in the long-running soap Emmerdale, a role he unashamedly, and gratefully, enjoyed in the twilight of his years, from 2005 to 2018. For an actor who could cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war with the best of them, he was surprisingly mild and unambitious, tall and courteous, bearded and ruddy-faced, one who declared that, \u201cMy life springs from my wife, my family, my work and my whisky.\u201d</p> <p>He was born and raised in Dresden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/stoke-on-trent\" title=\"\">Stoke-on-Trent</a>, one of two sons of Charles Jones, an electrical porcelain thrower and his wife, Ida (nee Godwin), and attended the nearby grammar school in Longton, which he hated. As a boy scout, he appeared in a show at the old Theatre Royal in Hanley. On leaving school to work at Creda, the home appliances store, in Blythe Bridge and then for 10 years as a lab assistant at a chemical factory in Tamworth, he immersed himself in amateur dramatics at the old Shelton rep and other companies around Stoke.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5275e478682f4356e9b14f46d2e8b7eb45f81464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5275e478682f4356e9b14f46d2e8b7eb45f81464/0_77_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Freddie Jones as Mr Bytes with John Hurt in The Elephant Man, 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freddie Jones as Mr Bytes with John Hurt in The Elephant Man, 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Brooksfilm/StudioCanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So he was well into his 30s by the time he trained at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/rosebrufordcollege\" title=\"\">Rose Bruford</a> and made his London debut with the RSC at the Arts Theatre in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/rudkin\" title=\"\">David Rudkin\u2019s</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2001/sep/27/theatre.artsfeatures\" title=\"\">Afore Night Come</a> (1962) and at the Aldwych in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/16/in-praise-maxim-gorky\" title=\"\">Gorky\u2019s</a> Lower Depths in 1964.

      "bodyText": "Freddie Jones, who has died aged 91, was the best sort of old-fashioned actor, a comic tragedian, eccentric and full-hearted, with something of both Donald Wolfit and Dickens\u2019 Vincent Crummles about him. Indeed, his most famous stage role was that of Ronald Harwood\u2019s affectionate near-portrait of Wolfit in The Dresser (1980), an old ham called \u201cSir\u201d who faces disaster in the mirror while preparing to play King Lear. And he memorably embodied the extravagant Crummles in a television Nicholas Nickleby of 1977. If Jones sometimes emulated Wolfit, his real hero was Wilfrid Lawson, a bibulous character actor who could break your heart on the instant, and he always welcomed the comparison. Yet, to the general public, he was never a name in lights, his career was patchwork and he suffered the indignity of outright failure in a role that should have been a triumph, Malvolio in Twelfth Night, when he returned to the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1991, three decades after his debut in 1962. Instead, he achieved a recognition of sorts as Sandy Thomas, the estranged father of a vicar, in the long-running soap Emmerdale, a role he unashamedly, and gratefully, enjoyed in the twilight of his years, from 2005 to 2018. For an actor who could cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war with the best of them, he was surprisingly mild and unambitious, tall and courteous, bearded and ruddy-faced, one who declared that, \u201cMy life springs from my wife, my family, my work and my whisky.\u201d He was born and raised in Dresden, Stoke-on-Trent, one of two sons of Charles Jones, an electrical porcelain thrower and his wife, Ida (nee Godwin), and attended the nearby grammar school in Longton, which he hated. As a boy scout, he appeared in a show at the old Theatre Royal in Hanley. On leaving school to work at Creda, the home appliances store, in Blythe Bridge and then for 10 years as a lab assistant at a chemical factory in Tamworth, he immersed himself in amateur dramatics at the old Shelton rep and other companies around Stoke. So he was well into his 30s by the time he trained at Rose Bruford and made his London debut with the RSC at the Arts Theatre in David Rudkin\u2019s Afore Night Come (1962) and at the Aldwych in Gorky\u2019s Lower Depths in 1964. He was immediately one of the company\u2019s most distinctive character actors and appeared in Beckett\u2019s Act Without Words, as Pistol in The Merry Wives of Windsor and as Cucurucu in Peter Brook\u2019s landmark 1964 production of The Marat/Sade (released as a film in 1967) alongside Glenda Jackson, Ian Richardson and Patrick Magee. He made his first impression on television as Claudius in the six-part ITV series of The Caesars (1968), followed by rich cameos in Cold Comfort Farm (1968), Alice Through the Looking Glass, as Humpty Dumpty (1973) and as a headteacher in Dennis Potter\u2019s Pennies from Heaven (1978). Best of all, he was an irascible Victorian general, Sir George Uproar, in The Ghosts of Motley Hall (1976-78) by Richard (\u201cCatweazle\u201d) Carpenter, a children\u2019s show with luxury casting \u2013 Nicholas Le Prevost, Sheila Steafel, Peter Sallis, Arthur English \u2013 as a host of goofy ghosts protecting an old family seat against the incursion of property speculators. And he began to accumulate a decent cinematic portfolio with roles in Joseph Losey\u2019s Accident (1967) \u2013 he played a man in the office of Harold Pinter\u2019s scowling TV producer \u2013 John Schlesinger\u2019s Far From the Madding Crowd (1967) and the oddball crime caper Otley (1968) starring Tom Courtenay. It was with Courtenay that he enjoyed his greatest stage success 12 years later, a blast of a performance as \u201cSir\u201d at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester that took everyone by surprise, mainly because we had forgotten what a great actor he was and could be. No subsequent performance in The Dresser \u2013 not Albert Finney in the 1983 film, nor Anthony Hopkins on television in 2015, nor Ken Stott in the West End in 2016 \u2013 matched the rumbling thunder of Jones in Manchester and subsequently at the Queen\u2019s in London. With the bombs dropping on a provincial town in 1942, he slumped into the dressing room, dispirited, starting in horror at the nightmare to come and collapsed in tears while Courtenay\u2019s dresser, Norman, leaning backwards while gliding forwards, launched poisonous glances back over his shoulder into Sir\u2019s make-up mirror. Rather like Nigel Hawthorne in Alan Bennett\u2019s The Madness of King George, Jones played Lear while skirting round the periphery of the role. The actor himself \u2013 \u201cSir\u201d/Jones \u2013 was the tragic, heartbroken hero. His favourite screen role was Orlando, an intermittently drunk journalist in Fellini\u2019s And the Ship Sails On (1983), who is chronicling the journey of a party of hedonists committed to scattering the ashes of a dead opera singer whose on-board friends and admirers included Barbara Jefford, Janet Suzman, Peter Cellier and the German dancer/choreographer Pina Bausch. After appearing as Bytes, the bullying freak-show owner in David Lynch\u2019s The Elephant Man (1980) starring John Hurt, he collaborated further with Lynch on Dune (1984), Wild at Heart (1990) and in Lynch\u2019s bizarre three-part US television series On the Air (screened in Britain in 1993), in which he played a guest star on a live variety show having trouble with his voice and with a duck that is roasted in an electric chair and consumed by stage hands. Jones played another celebrated thespian, Sir Giles Hampton, in an episode of Just William on TV in 1994, rescuing the little blighter\u2019s career in am-dram, while his gallery of actor-managers was vividly increased by another fruity cameo as Thomas Betterton, pride of the Restoration theatre, with Johnny Depp as the Earl of Rochester, in The Libertine (2005), adapted by Stephen Jeffreys from his own stage play. And there were other performances to treasure such as Barkis (\u201cis willin\u2019\u201d) in Peter Medak\u2019s TV version of David Copperfield (2000); a rubicund fisherman in Charles Dance\u2019s delightful Ladies in Lavender (starring Judi Dench and Maggie Smith, 2004), with Jones\u2019s son, Toby Jones, popping in as a village postman; and as an Irish domestic bulwark on a slow burn in Finola Geraghty\u2019s Come On Eileen (2010). He had nothing to prove on stage after The Dresser, but still, his continued absence was marked and regrettable. In the 1991 RSC season, the Malvolio misfire was in part compensated for by a dotty and hilarious performance as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack in Thomas Shadwell\u2019s 17th-century comedy The Virtuoso, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. Jones\u2019s Gimcrack was bent on a course of pointless scientific research \u2013 dissecting insects and lobsters, perfecting the art of swimming on dry land and collecting bottled air \u2013 in a superb display of gravely befuddled distraction. This suburban Galileo even imagined the invention of the telephone in his waggling of the stentorophonic tube, just as Puck may have imagined Sputnik in putting a girdle round the Earth in 40 minutes.

Paleontologists view the excursions as failed dispersals, with the pioneers ultimately dying out and leaving no genetic legacy in people alive today.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur results indicate that an early dispersal of <em>Homo sapiens</em> out of Africa occurred earlier than previously believed, before 200,000 years ago,\u201d Karvati said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing evidence for human dispersals that are not just limited to one major exodus out of Africa.\u201d</p> \n<p>For some researchers, however, the claim is bolder than the evidence can bear. Experts contacted by the Guardian doubted whether the skull really belonged to a modern human, and had concerns about the dating procedure. Flaws in either could fatally undermine the scientists\u2019 narrative.</p> \n<p>The story of the skull is unusual from the start. It was found during excavations of the Apidima cave, a hole in a limestone cliff that now towers over the sea, in the late 1970s. The fossil was encased in a lump of rock, mere inches from another skull and several bone fragments. The rock itself was wedged high up between adjacent walls of the cave.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"bf676001-cc57-4221-b584-225b3d030a46\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>500,000 years ago</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><i>Homo sapiens</i> and Neanderthal lineages diverge.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>300,000 years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Date of fossils belonging to early&nbsp;<i>Homo sapiens&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;discovered in Jebel Irhoud, Morocco.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>195,000 years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Date of <i>Homo sapiens</i> fossils found in Omo Kibish, Ethiopia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>177,000 -194,000 years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Approximate date of <i>Homo sapiens</i> fossils found in Misliya cave, Israel.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>100,000 years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Dating of a trove of human teeth found in China.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>65,000 years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Archaeological evidence of modern human presence in northern Australia.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>60-80,000 years</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Major dispersal event from Africa from which all non-Africans are descended.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Once removed from the cave, the skulls were stored in a museum in Athens but received little attention until recently, in part because they are so damaged and incomplete. The second skull, which retains a face, was studied the most and identified as Neanderthal. The first skull, consisting only of the back of the skull, was largely ignored.</p> \n<p>Harvati and her co-workers set out to examine both. They took CT scans of the fossils and from these created virtual 3D reconstructions. The 3D models were then compared with skulls from various ancient <em>Homo sapiens</em>, Neanderthals and modern humans.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1376-z\">Writing in the journal Nature</a>, the scientists describe how their analysis confirmed the second skull, which has a thick, rounded brow ridge, as Neanderthal. But to their surprise, the other partial skull most closely matched that of a modern human. The main evidence was the rounded back and the lack of a classic Neanderthal bulge that looks like hair tied back in a bun.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe part that is preserved, the back of the skull, is very diagnostic in differentiating Neanderthals and modern humans from each other and from earlier archaic humans,\u201d Harvati said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbc54d46a649eab6b25950173bd962eb0181b18b\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbc54d46a649eab6b25950173bd962eb0181b18b/0_0_2074_945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Apidima 1 partial cranium (right) and its reconstruction.

The tests found the Neanderthal skull to be at least 170,000 years old and the <em>Homo sapiens</em> skull at least 210,000 years old, with the rock encasing them more than 150,000 years old. The range of ages could be explained by the skulls mixing together in a mudflow that later solidified in the cave.</p> \n<p>If at least some early modern humans left Africa more than 210,000 years ago, they may have settled in the Levant before expanding west into Europe, which was already home to Neanderthals. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jan/25/oldest-known-human-fossil-outside-africa-discovered-in-israel\">a modern human fossil dating to nearly 200,000 years old</a> was found in the Misliya cave in northern Israel.

      "bodyText": "A broken skull chiselled from a lump of rock in a cave in Greece is the oldest modern human fossil ever found outside Africa, researchers claim. The partial skull was discovered in the Apidima cave on the Mani peninsula of the southern Peloponnese and has been dated to be at least 210,000 years old. If the claim is verified \u2013 and many scientists want more proof \u2013 the finding will rewrite a key chapter of the human story, with the skull becoming the oldest known Homo sapiens fossil in Europe by more than 160,000 years. Katerina Harvati, the director of paleoanthropology at the University of T\u00fcbingen in Germany, said the skull revealed that at least some modern humans had left Africa far earlier than previously thought and reached further geographically to settle as far away as Europe. Other fossils of early modern humans found in Israel already point to brief excursions out of Africa, where the species evolved, long before the mass exodus during which Homo sapiens spread from the continent about 70,000 years ago and colonised the world. Paleontologists view the excursions as failed dispersals, with the pioneers ultimately dying out and leaving no genetic legacy in people alive today. \u201cOur results indicate that an early dispersal of Homo sapiens out of Africa occurred earlier than previously believed, before 200,000 years ago,\u201d Karvati said. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing evidence for human dispersals that are not just limited to one major exodus out of Africa.\u201d For some researchers, however, the claim is bolder than the evidence can bear. Experts contacted by the Guardian doubted whether the skull really belonged to a modern human, and had concerns about the dating procedure. Flaws in either could fatally undermine the scientists\u2019 narrative. The story of the skull is unusual from the start. It was found during excavations of the Apidima cave, a hole in a limestone cliff that now towers over the sea, in the late 1970s. The fossil was encased in a lump of rock, mere inches from another skull and several bone fragments. The rock itself was wedged high up between adjacent walls of the cave. Once removed from the cave, the skulls were stored in a museum in Athens but received little attention until recently, in part because they are so damaged and incomplete. The second skull, which retains a face, was studied the most and identified as Neanderthal. The first skull, consisting only of the back of the skull, was largely ignored. Harvati and her co-workers set out to examine both. They took CT scans of the fossils and from these created virtual 3D reconstructions. The 3D models were then compared with skulls from various ancient Homo sapiens, Neanderthals and modern humans. Writing in the journal Nature, the scientists describe how their analysis confirmed the second skull, which has a thick, rounded brow ridge, as Neanderthal. But to their surprise, the other partial skull most closely matched that of a modern human. The main evidence was the rounded back and the lack of a classic Neanderthal bulge that looks like hair tied back in a bun. \u201cThe part that is preserved, the back of the skull, is very diagnostic in differentiating Neanderthals and modern humans from each other and from earlier archaic humans,\u201d Harvati said. Scientists on the team then dated the fossils with a method that relies on the radioactive decay of natural uranium in the buried remains. The tests found the Neanderthal skull to be at least 170,000 years old and the Homo sapiens skull at least 210,000 years old, with the rock encasing them more than 150,000 years old. The range of ages could be explained by the skulls mixing together in a mudflow that later solidified in the cave. If at least some early modern humans left Africa more than 210,000 years ago, they may have settled in the Levant before expanding west into Europe, which was already home to Neanderthals. Last year, a modern human fossil dating to nearly 200,000 years old was found in the Misliya cave in northern Israel. Any early human pioneers who did reach Europe died out there, before the Neanderthals themselves were replaced by an influx of Homo sapiens about 40,000 years ago. Some scientists are calling for more evidence. Warren Sharp at the Berkeley Geochronology Center in California said the team\u2019s tests on the supposedly modern human skull had produced wildly different dates, a sign that uranium may have been lost from the bones over time. \u201cIf so, the fossil\u2019s calculated age is too old, and its true age is unknown, calling into question the premise of the paper,\u201d he said. Juan Luis Arsuaga, a Spanish palaeoanthropologist, said he was not convinced the skull was from an early modern human. \u201cThe fossil is too fragmentary and incomplete for such a strong claim,\u201d he said. \u201cIn science, extraordinary claims require extraordinary proofs. A partial braincase, lacking the cranial base and the totality of the face, is not extraordinary evidence to my mind.\u201d John Hawks, a palaeontologist at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, voiced similar doubts: \u201cCan we really use a small part of the skull like this to recognise our species?\u201d he said. \u201cThe storyline in this paper is that the skull is more rounded in the back, with more vertical sides, and that makes it similar to modern humans.

      "bodyText": "A Spanish court has ruled that the pop star Julio Iglesias is the biological father of a 42-year-old man whose mother said she had a brief affair with the singer in the 1970s. In a case that has dragged on for two years, a judge in Valencia ruled that Javier S\u00e1nchez Santos, who now lives in Italy, is the Spanish singer\u2019s son despite Iglesias repeatedly refusing to give a DNA sample. The judge\u2019s decision was based on the testimony of Mar\u00eda Edite, a former ballerina, who said she had a one-week affair with Iglesias in Sant Feliu de Gu\u00edxols on the Costa Brava in 1975 and that Santos was born as a result of that relationship. The case had already been dismissed in 1992 but Santos\u2019s lawyer, Fernando Osuna, insisted DNA evidence procured by a detective in the US was cause for the case to be reopened. The detective managed to get hold of a water bottle that the singer\u2019s son Julio Iglesias Jr was drinking from when he was surfing in Miami. Osuna claimed DNA testing showed that Santos and Iglesias Jr were brothers. The judge refused to admit the DNA as evidence but in his ruling stated that \u201cthere is a clear physical resemblance between father and son\u201d as well as the evidence that \u201cat the time of conception there was a certain amount of contact between Mar\u00eda Edite Santos and Julio Iglesias during which time it is not implausible that they had a sexual relationship\u201d. Iglesias, 75, who was not in court, has consistently denied he is the father and his lawyers say he will appeal against the decision. The Grammy-winning singer, who has sold more than 300m albums over a long career, is probably Spain\u2019s biggest international star and sang at the White House at Ronald Reagan\u2019s Christmas party in 1983. However, his love life has won him as much publicity as his music, and he has been keeping Spain\u2019s sensationalist \u201cpink press\u201d in copy for decades. Santos aside, he has eight children, three from his relationship with Isabel Preysler, whom he married in 1971, and five more with his second wife, Miranda Rijnsburger. Before the ruling, Preysler, who was Iglesias\u2019s wife at the time of the alleged affair, said she believed that if it was proven that Santos was his son, Iglesias would \u201cdo his duty as a father because Julio has always been a very responsible person\u201d. Enrique, the third son of Preysler and Iglesias, is also a successful singer who has won five Latin Grammys.",

In the first half of the menstrual cycle, Bruinvels says, your body uses carbohydrates more efficiently (depending on the exercise\u2019s intensity); in the second, it is better at using fats. \u201cThere is a body of research emerging that highlights that strength training is more advantageous in the first half of the menstrual cycle \u2013 the body adapts and recovers better.\u201d Tracking your cycle with apps (including FitrCoach, which Bruinvels developed) can help tailor training and diet to work with your cycle, rather than against it. The England women\u2019s hockey team have been tracking their periods since before the 2012 Olympics, the team\u2019s former captain Kate Richardson-Walsh has said. Their strength and conditioning coach found a pattern with soft-tissue injuries: \u201cWe would send a text on day one of our cycle, so he could mark it on our training calendar. He tried to monitor \u2013 as much as you can with a squad of 28 women \u2013 our training loads depending on our menstrual cycle.\u201d The British tennis player Heather Watson was widely praised in 2015 for being a rare athlete to talk about her period and the symptoms that led her to crash out of the Australian Open. As research and support for the needs of female athletes lags behind, the English Institute of Sport launched its SmartHER campaign this year to educate coaches, physios and athletes. Do most female athletes track their cycles, then? \u201cYou\u2019d think so,\u201d says Bruinvels, \u201cbut I\u2019ve been really surprised that they don\u2019t.\u201d",

The teenager would check out the building\u2019s security operations in various disguises, sometimes wearing a suit, other times in sports gear, in order to avoid being spotted and potentially handed a restraining order.

King\u2019s parents, who acknowledge his passion but do not condone the danger he puts himself into, found out the news via the radio. \u201cThey knew I was up to something, but I don\u2019t think they expected it to be the Shard,\u201d said King. \u201cBut when my mum heard it on the radio she instantaneously thought \u2018that must be George\u2019.\u201d Among the buildings King plans to free solo in future is the 1,000-metre-tall Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, although he wants to do so with a permit this time. King said he has been inundated with less adrenaline-fuelled opportunities. By Wednesday morning he had received offers over social media from motivational speech organisers and a modelling agency. \u201cI\u2019m open to any opportunity as long as it\u2019s not ridiculous \u2013 why not,\u201d said King. \u201cLots of things are popping up and I\u2019m just taking what I can.\u201d Since Monday, he has already doubled his number of followers on Instagram after posting both drone and camera footage of his Shard climb. He didn\u2019t wear a head camera because \u201cit was too much of a distraction\u201d. At least for a little while, though, King said he will take his foot off the pedal and get back to being a typical 19-year-old. \u201cIn the last eight months I was so invested in this. Now it\u2019s finally time to see people I haven\u2019t seen for a while.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "Billionaire inventor James Dyson has bought a \u00a343m luxury penthouse, thought to be the most expensive flat in Singapore, months after the prominent Brexit supporter announced plans to move his company from the UK to the island city-state. Dyson, 72, bought a 99-year lease on the Super Penthouse, a sprawling five-bedroom flat in Singapore\u2019s prestigious Wallich Residence, according to property records. The purchase was first reported by the Singapore Business Times, which said Dyson and his wife, Deirdre, paid $73.8m (\u00a343m), about $5m less than the asking price initially set by developer GuocoLand. Dyson will be able to oversee his business empire from a triplex apartment perched at the top of Singapore\u2019s tallest building. At 290 metres, it makes the flat the highest point in the city, according to one luxury estate agent\u2019s website. The 21,108 sq ft property, the largest flat in Singapore, features a 12-metre swimming pool, roof terrace, cabana, jacuzzi room, bar facilities, 600-bottle wine cellar, two kitchens and an entertainment room. It also boasts a 24-hour butler service, which can assist the owner with tedious chores such as chartering a yacht or private jet or arranging a private chef to cater for a dinner party. A GuocoLand brochure detailing the apartment\u2019s virtues says: \u201cIf there ever was a statement to be made about what you have accomplished and achieved, and how far you\u2019ve come \u2013 this is it.\u201d Dyson, who invented the bagless vacuum cleaner and is working on an electric car, has come under fire for professing his support for Brexit, only to move his company\u2019s headquarters from Wiltshire to Singapore before the UK has completed its exit from the EU. He has previously said Brexit had nothing to do with the decision. The Dyson company employs 4,500 people in the UK, where it carries out its research and development. Dyson, who was listed third on the list of the UK\u2019s top taxpayers last year with a \u00a3127.8m bill, has also denied Singapore\u2019s corporation tax rate, 17% compared with 19% in the UK, was a factor. But some experts have said that Singapore\u2019s tax regime governing any patents the company registers there in future would make the city-state an attractive location. Before announcing the move to Singapore, Dyson had already chosen to build its planned electric vehicle there, with the first model due to roll off the production line in 2021. The company cited Singapore\u2019s proximity to fast-growing Asian economies, where demand for electric cars is expected to surge in coming decades. A spokesperson for Dyson said: \u201cGiven the decision to locate the headquarters in Singapore and the growing focus of the company\u2019s business in the region, of course James Dyson has bought a property there.\u201d Dyson also owns a country estate in Gloucestershire.",

Kohli thrust his bat at it and the ball curved back in and hit him high on the knee. As Richard Illingworth raised his finger, Kohli reeled back in shock, so aghast it looked like the umpire had dropped a priceless vase. Kohli reviewed it and the replay showed the ball would have just caught the top of the bails.</p> <p>Three balls later KL Rahul was caught in two minds about whether to play a delivery from Henry and he, too, sliced a catch through to Latham. So India were five for three. And for the first time in the history of international cricket, all the first three batsmen in an innings had been dismissed for a single run each, which is a new variation on the old curse of Nelson. And it meant India were faced with a new problem, one they had not met in the tournament yet.</p> <p>Between the three of them, Sharma, Kohli, and Rahul had scored just under two-thirds of all their runs in this World Cup, and faced just over two thirds of all their deliveries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f4345e40f8e5c2bdb6907a2c73269673bc81936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f4345e40f8e5c2bdb6907a2c73269673bc81936/0_0_3074_2465/1000.jpg\" alt=\"India fans look dejected at Old Trafford.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">India fans look dejected at Old Trafford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt West/BPI/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now their middle-order had to cover for them. Dinesh Karthik was already struggling. Henry got him. Or rather, Jimmy Neesham did, with an astonishing catch at backward point, diving down, one-handed, wrong-handed, to take the ball just before it hit the grass. India were 23 for four, and their two swaggering young batsmen, Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, set about trying to rebuild the innings.</p> <p>In the end, neither could resist the temptation, the devilish invitation, to try to do something spectacular. Pant went first, trying to wallop Mitch Santner for six, then Pandya followed in exactly the same way.</p> <p>At that point Santner, plugging away from around the wicket, had bowled six overs, and taken two for seven. India needed 148 from 19 overs but in many ways the game was only just beginning. Dhoni, the old master, was embedded at one end and Jadeja was at the other. They were the perfect pair for the situation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dhoni played so carefully he might have been carrying a clipboard and a risk assessment form, but he seemed supremely confident, all the while, that he knew exactly what he had to do. He has done these sums before and seldom got them wrong. At the other end, Jadeja, full of fire and fury after his argument with the Indian pundit Sanjay Manjrekar, who had disparaged him as a \u201cbits and pieces player\u201d, gathered up Dhoni\u2019s slack and started picking off sixes down the ground. Together they wrestled back the match with a 116-run partnership.</p> <p>They needed 42 runs from the last four overs when Jadeja, on 77, missed one of those big hits, and was caught by Williamson.</p> <p>So it all came down to Dhoni. And he nearly did it too. He had just crashed his first six, an uppercut that whizzed over Santner\u2019s fingertips at deep point, when he made his first real mistake. It was only a minor one, a momentary hesitation, over whether or not to try for the second run his partner had called for, but in a match of such fine margins, it was fatal. Guptill\u2019s throw beat him home. He was out, and India were too.</p>",

Three balls later KL Rahul was caught in two minds about whether to play a delivery from Henry and he, too, sliced a catch through to Latham. So India were five for three. And for the first time in the history of international cricket, all the first three batsmen in an innings had been dismissed for a single run each, which is a new variation on the old curse of Nelson. And it meant India were faced with a new problem, one they had not met in the tournament yet. Between the three of them, Sharma, Kohli, and Rahul had scored just under two-thirds of all their runs in this World Cup, and faced just over two thirds of all their deliveries. Now their middle-order had to cover for them. Dinesh Karthik was already struggling. Henry got him. Or rather, Jimmy Neesham did, with an astonishing catch at backward point, diving down, one-handed, wrong-handed, to take the ball just before it hit the grass. India were 23 for four, and their two swaggering young batsmen, Rishabh Pant and Hardik Pandya, set about trying to rebuild the innings. In the end, neither could resist the temptation, the devilish invitation, to try to do something spectacular. Pant went first, trying to wallop Mitch Santner for six, then Pandya followed in exactly the same way. At that point Santner, plugging away from around the wicket, had bowled six overs, and taken two for seven. India needed 148 from 19 overs but in many ways the game was only just beginning. Dhoni, the old master, was embedded at one end and Jadeja was at the other. They were the perfect pair for the situation. Dhoni played so carefully he might have been carrying a clipboard and a risk assessment form, but he seemed supremely confident, all the while, that he knew exactly what he had to do. He has done these sums before and seldom got them wrong. At the other end, Jadeja, full of fire and fury after his argument with the Indian pundit Sanjay Manjrekar, who had disparaged him as a \u201cbits and pieces player\u201d, gathered up Dhoni\u2019s slack and started picking off sixes down the ground. Together they wrestled back the match with a 116-run partnership. They needed 42 runs from the last four overs when Jadeja, on 77, missed one of those big hits, and was caught by Williamson. So it all came down to Dhoni. And he nearly did it too. He had just crashed his first six, an uppercut that whizzed over Santner\u2019s fingertips at deep point, when he made his first real mistake. It was only a minor one, a momentary hesitation, over whether or not to try for the second run his partner had called for, but in a match of such fine margins, it was fatal. Guptill\u2019s throw beat him home. He was out, and India were too.",

He had been travelling at 83mph in a 30mph zone. Violet-Grace suffered catastrophic injuries and died in hospital. </p> <p>It has now emerged that during his sentencing earlier this year McAteer won the right to have parts of the family\u2019s statement redacted.</p> <p>Marie Rimmer MP told a Westminster Hall debate that McAteer\u2019s barrister at Liverpool crown court objected to the parents\u2019 full statement, arguing that the defendant would find it \u201ctoo upsetting\u201d.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe judge accepted this and the CPS barrister gave the parents a copy of their impact statement with parts they could not read out in open court highlighted.\u201d</p> <p>Now Rimmer is calling for an improvement in the law and said she would press the victims\u2019 commissioner to back a call for impact statements to be read in full in open court by default.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe law must be improved for victims and survivors.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole purpose of the victim impact statement is the impact on the victims and the survivors, not the defendant. Guidance should be given to the judiciary that the overriding consideration is for the victim and their family, not whether the impact statement may upset the defendant.\u201d</p> <p>Following the crash in March 2017 McAteer, who was 23, went to Amsterdam but later returned to Britain. He was jailed at Liverpool crown court in May 2017 after admitting causing death by dangerous driving.</p> <p>Rimmer, Labour MP for St Helens South and Whiston, will now raise the case with Dame Vera Baird, QC, the victims\u2019 commissioner, and said she knew of at least two other hearings in which impact statements had been edited after pleas by defence lawyers.</p> <p>On Monday parliament debated Violet-Grace\u2019s law after her parents launched a petition for tougher sentences for dangerous drivers.</p> <p>Almost 166,000 people have signed the petition which calls for life sentences to be considered for those convicted of dangerous driving.</p> <p>Her father Glenn told the Guardian that being asked to redact part of the victim impact statement had been a further blow after discovering those involved in their daughter\u2019s death would only be receiving \u201cincredibly short sentences\u201d.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWe were told that we wouldn\u2019t be able to read the full statement because it was upsetting. We were quite shocked at this but mostly angry that we had to protect our daughter\u2019s killer from becoming distressed.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the ones that had lost our daughter yet we were made to feel like we had to put her killer first \u2026 it made us lose faith in the justice system.\u201d</p> <p>McAteer, who was driving the high-powered Ford which went through two red lights before careering out of control, fled the scene of the crash, leaving his two victims lying in the road. He was jailed for nine years and four months.</p> <p>His passenger, 27-year-old Dean Brennan, who also fled, was jailed for six years and eight months.</p> <p>In a statement calling for a change in the law, Violet-Grace\u2019s mother, Rebecca, said: \u201cIn October 2017, the government promised life sentences for death by dangerous driving. It\u2019s now 2019.</p> <p>\u201cInnocent people have been killed, but nothing has changed. The law is out of date.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone convicted of death by dangerous driving should receive life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 15 years.</p> <p>\u201cIf more than one person is killed or injured, the sentences must run separately. We don\u2019t want anyone to feel the pain and injustice we have.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a life sentence as does Violet.\u201d</p>",

      "bodyText": "An MP has called for a change in judicial rules after the parents of a four-year-old girl killed by a speeding driver had their victim impact statement edited because it would upset the driver during his sentencing. Glenn and Rebecca Youens\u2019 daughter, Violet-Grace, was with her grandmother when Aidan McAteer mounted the pavement in a stolen car. He had been travelling at 83mph in a 30mph zone. Violet-Grace suffered catastrophic injuries and died in hospital. It has now emerged that during his sentencing earlier this year McAteer won the right to have parts of the family\u2019s statement redacted. Marie Rimmer MP told a Westminster Hall debate that McAteer\u2019s barrister at Liverpool crown court objected to the parents\u2019 full statement, arguing that the defendant would find it \u201ctoo upsetting\u201d. She said: \u201cThe judge accepted this and the CPS barrister gave the parents a copy of their impact statement with parts they could not read out in open court highlighted.\u201d Now Rimmer is calling for an improvement in the law and said she would press the victims\u2019 commissioner to back a call for impact statements to be read in full in open court by default. She said: \u201cThe law must be improved for victims and survivors. \u201cThe whole purpose of the victim impact statement is the impact on the victims and the survivors, not the defendant. Guidance should be given to the judiciary that the overriding consideration is for the victim and their family, not whether the impact statement may upset the defendant.\u201d Following the crash in March 2017 McAteer, who was 23, went to Amsterdam but later returned to Britain. He was jailed at Liverpool crown court in May 2017 after admitting causing death by dangerous driving. Rimmer, Labour MP for St Helens South and Whiston, will now raise the case with Dame Vera Baird, QC, the victims\u2019 commissioner, and said she knew of at least two other hearings in which impact statements had been edited after pleas by defence lawyers. On Monday parliament debated Violet-Grace\u2019s law after her parents launched a petition for tougher sentences for dangerous drivers. Almost 166,000 people have signed the petition which calls for life sentences to be considered for those convicted of dangerous driving. Her father Glenn told the Guardian that being asked to redact part of the victim impact statement had been a further blow after discovering those involved in their daughter\u2019s death would only be receiving \u201cincredibly short sentences\u201d. He said: \u201cWe were told that we wouldn\u2019t be able to read the full statement because it was upsetting. We were quite shocked at this but mostly angry that we had to protect our daughter\u2019s killer from becoming distressed. \u201cWe were the ones that had lost our daughter yet we were made to feel like we had to put her killer first \u2026 it made us lose faith in the justice system.\u201d McAteer, who was driving the high-powered Ford which went through two red lights before careering out of control, fled the scene of the crash, leaving his two victims lying in the road. He was jailed for nine years and four months. His passenger, 27-year-old Dean Brennan, who also fled, was jailed for six years and eight months. In a statement calling for a change in the law, Violet-Grace\u2019s mother, Rebecca, said: \u201cIn October 2017, the government promised life sentences for death by dangerous driving. It\u2019s now 2019. \u201cInnocent people have been killed, but nothing has changed. The law is out of date. \u201cAnyone convicted of death by dangerous driving should receive life imprisonment with a minimum tariff of 15 years. \u201cIf more than one person is killed or injured, the sentences must run separately. We don\u2019t want anyone to feel the pain and injustice we have. \u201cWe have a life sentence as does Violet.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "A total of 176 men on bikes went gallivanting around Alsace and to nobody\u2019s huge surprise, the one dressed in green came first. Read on ... Preview by William Fotheringham: Short and intense over four brutal climbs culminating with the ascent where Chris Froome won in 2012. The main action will come in the final 20km over the very narrow and steep Col des Chevr\u00e8res, which hits 18%, and the finish climb which goes to 20%. It\u2019s a typical first key day at the Tour: the time gaps should be a bit less than in other years as we are still in the opening week but the chances are only 10 or a dozen riders will be in with a shout after this one. Local boy Thibaut Pinot might be the best bet to win the stage and steal an early march. That sprint reviewed: Daryl Impey was first to go, opening the sprint for Matteo Trentin, whose wheel Sagan had latched on to. The Slovak came around the outside with about 100 metres to go and was never going to be stopped. \u201cI did my best and it just came,\u201d he tells Eurosport. \u201cNothing was missing and also everybody needs good luck.\u201d Stage five top five 1. Peter Sagan 2. Wout van Aert 3. Matteo Trentin 4. Sonny Colbrelli 5. Greg Van Avermaet Peter Sagan wins! Michael Matthews will feel he made a mess of that one. He found himself on the wrong wheel as the race entered its knockings and paid the price accordingly. Sagan wins his 12th stage of the Tour. He was followed home by Wout van Aert and Matteo Trentin. Chapeau to Van Aert, who is having a dream start to his first Tour. He\u2019s in the white jersey for best young riders and looks a real class act. \u201cThe jolly green giant has done it again!\u201d roars Rob Hatch on Eurosport. 500m to go: Bora Hansgrohe have more men at the front than Team Sunweb, who only have one in place to give Michael Matthews a lead-out. 1.7km to go: Costa is caught and we\u2019re going to have a sprint finish. 2km to go: Costa stays in front, but he\u2019s almost certainly going to be caught. 3km to go: Rui Costa continues with his audacious attempt at a smash-and-grab with Bora Hansgrohe and Team Sunweb leading the chase to stop him getting away. 5km to go: Costa\u2019s lead grows to 12 seconds. He hasn\u2019t won a Grand Tour stage since 2013. 6km to go: UAE Team Emirates rider, Rui Costa, attacks off the front of the bunch and opens a gap of eight seconds. The peloton, led by Team Sunweb, doesn\u2019t look too fussed. 8km to go: Boassen Hagen makes his way back to the front of the bunch. 10km to go: The field approach the end of the descent and it\u2019s flat all the way to the finish from this point on. The specialist sprinters have been left behind in the grupetto and - hats -off - Edvald Boassen Hagen is almost back in touch with the bunch after suffering the rotten luck of a mechanical at the foot of the final climb and being left behind. If he can win this stage after that misfortune, it would be an incredible effort. 12km to go: Julian Alaphilippe is third wheel in the bunch as the riders hurtle down a worryingly narrow road at terrifying speed. Matteo Trentin is just behind him as they motor down the mountain at speeds of over 70 kilometres an hour. 16km to go: Covered by a canopy of tree-tops on a narrow, steep downhill winding through dappled woodland, Team Sunweb continue to ride on the front. Behind them, the main GC contenders are all where they should be. 19km to go: Wanty-Groupe Gobert rider Xander Meurisse is first over the top of the day\u2019s final climb and begins the approach to the technical, lightning fast descent. 20km to go: It\u2019s just over a kilometre to the summit of the day\u2019s final climb and Team Sunweb are forcing a brutal pace at the front of the bunch, which is shelling riders at a rate of knots. 21km to go: Toms Skujins is caught by the bunch, which is being driven up the hill by Team Sunweb. Out the back, Katusha-Alpecin rider Ilnur Zakarin is struggling badly to stay in touch. An email: \u201cThe polka dot jersey is your favorite?\u201d asks Greg Pandise. \u201cI feel like often times the polka dot jersey doesn\u2019t go to the actual best climber of the tour. Honestly, the best climber of the tour ends up being in the yellow most of the time.\u201d A fair point, well made, but it\u2019s just my favourite jersey on an aesthetic level. 23km to go: Tom Skujins\u2019 15 minutes of fame are about to come an end as his advantage is down to 19 seconds. He hits the foot of the final climb, the Category three Cote Des Cinq Chateux. Back in the bunch, Edvald Boassen Hagan has a mechanical issue, which could scupper his chances of being involved in today\u2019s shake-up. 26km to go: The gap is 43 seconds as Toms Skujins continues to enjoy his moment in the spotlight. 31km to go: Tim Wellens was second over the summit of that last climb and took three points. He\u2019d already guaranteed himself another day in the polka dot jersey, but will do exceptionally well to hold on it by close of play tomorrow. Still, an excellent effort by him today to get in the breakaway and guarantee himself another day in my favourite jersey. Meanwhile in the Giro Rosa (Women\u2019s Giro d\u2019Italia): \u201cAfter a stunning attack up the final climb in yesterday\u2019s stage, Annemiek van Vleuten put in another world-beating performance in today\u2019s time trail to give her a comfortable 4min 17sec lead over her nearest GC rival, Kasia Niewiadoma,\u201d writes one reader, who would rather remain anonymous. \u201cAnna van der Breggen rounds off the current GC podium and Elisa Longho Borgini keeps the best Italian rider jersey for another day.\u201d 34km to go: Toms Skujins crests the C\u00f4te des Trois-Epis with a lead of 1min 04sec over the main bunch. 35km to go: Mads Wurtz Schmidt is swallowed up by the bunch and gets a pat of appreciation/condolence on the backside from one of the Bora Hansgrohe riders riding second wheel. 36km to go: Toms Skujins is the sole leader of the stage with over a kilometre to go to the top of the penultimate climb of the day. 36km to go: Trek-Segafredo rider and Latvian national champion Toms Skujins attacks off the front of the breakaway. The gap is 1min 05 to the bunch, who are keeping the hammer down in a bid to shed all the out-and-out sprinters, so they won\u2019t be around to contest the business end of the stage. 37km to go: Katusha-Alpecin rider Mads Wurtz Schmidt is the first man in the breakaway to be dropped, three kilometres from the top. The gradient is 10% and Toms Skujins is lead the remaining trio. In the polka dot jersey, Tim Wellens is struggling to hang on. 43km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is 1min 33sec. The men in front are approaching the foot of the day\u2019s second Category Two climb. Dan Martin has just had a mechanical but is back with the bunch and I\u2019ll be back in five minutes. An email: \u201cI have a question about the King of our Hearts (go on, admit it), Peter Sagan,\u201d writes Dean Taylor. \u201cOver the years he has had incredible consistency in terms of stage podiums. Is it known how many he has had and how that compares historically? Does he have the most stage podiums of any rider? I wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised if he did.\u201d I have no idea how many times Sagan has finished in the top three in Grand Tour stages and wouldn\u2019t know where to find out, but there\u2019s almost certainly somebody out there who\u2019ll be able to steer us in the right direction. 53km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch is 1min 52sec and there are two climbs of note to negotiate in the final 30 kilometres. 66km to go: Tim Wellens leads the breakaway over the summit of the mountain to take maximum points. Five of them, to be exact. Here\u2019s what greeted them at the top. It\u2019ll be a while before Andre Greipel, Caleb Ewan and Alexander Kristoff pass it, as they\u2019re among several riders who have been dropped by the bunch. 68km to go: Marcus Burghardt leads the peloton up the mountain, which has a very imposing castle at the top. \u201cYour post about Burghardt being brought down by a Labrador reminded me of one of my all time favourite cycling and animal related incidents,\u201d writes Richard Whitmill. \u201cA cat found its way onto the track at the Six days of Ghent. The poor little guy almost got squashed by Mark Cavendish but was thankfully rescued by a crowd member.\u201d News: In the breakaway today, Mads Wurtz Schmidt is auditioning for a new job. 71km to go: Tim Wellens leads the breakaway up the first Category Two climb of this year\u2019s Tour, eager to snaffle the points available at the top to help keep in his polka dot jersey for as long as possible. His three amigos are unlikely to contest the race to the top, if his serene progress to the top of the day\u2019s first climb is any indication. Julian Alaphilippe: The talk on Eurosport at the moment is about whether or not Julian Alaphilippe and his Deceuninck\u2013Quick-Step teammates will be happy to protect the yellow jersey today or try to take the stage win as well. Irish cycling legend Sean Kelly thinks it depends on how the stage pans out. He reckons that if people start attacking early, Alaphilippe won\u2019t try to contest the stage as trying to close down these attacks will expend too much energy. But Kelly adds the caveat that if the Frenchman can \u201cget a sniff of the stage win with two kilometres to go\u201d his natural instinct will be to go for it it and he won\u2019t be able to help himself. The gap between the breakaway quartet and the bunch is 2min 18sec and the men in front are on the second classified climb of the day, the category two Cote du Hautkoenigsbourg. An email: \u201cIt\u2019s often overlooked, but the team competition can be just as exciting as the individual quest for glory,\u201d writes David Alderton. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit early to say for sure, but this year\u2019s could be an absolute corker with quite the number of on form riders across the teams. Given that, I reckon Ineos, FFJ and Mitchelton-Scott will do superbly.\u201d What? No Astana? No Lotto Soudal? No Jumbo Visma? I haven\u2019t been following cycling closely enough this season to venture a worthwhile opinion, to be honest. 88km to go: The gap is out to 2min 13sec as the riders approach the feed zone. My own Sky Pro Cycling Gatorade bottle is empty, so I\u2019m going to go fill it up as I don\u2019t have support staff to hand me a fresh one. Here, in case you missed it yesterday, is a little insight into what goes into those musettes the cyclists are handed by their soigneurs. Hats off to Marcus Burghardt The German Bora Hansgrohe rider took a solitary point in today\u2019s intermediate sprint and to celebrate, here is some footage of him being brought down by the world\u2019s dopiest but hardest Labrador 12 years ago. Just look at that front wheel buckle. I wonder if the dog\u2019s still around today? He\u2019d be quite elderly at this stage. Intermediate sprint result 1. Simon Clarke: 20 points 2. Mads W\u00fcrtz Schmidt: 17 3. Toms Skujins: 15 4. Tim Wellens: 13 5. Elia Viviani: 11 6. Peter Sagan; 10 7. Michael Matthews: 9 8. Max Richeze: 8 9. Giacomo Nizzolo: 7 10. Caleb Ewan: 6 11. Thomas De Gendt: 5 12. Sonny Colbrelli: 4 13. Jan Tratnik: 3 14. Daniel Oss: 2 15. Marcus Burghardt: 1 94km to go: The gap goes out to 2min 05sec, with the breakaway quartet travelling at 57km per hour, while their chasers are going at a more sedate 55. 99km to go: Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews, both of whom will fancy their chances of winning today\u2019s stage, are currently deep in conversation as they ride along. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me who\u2019s noticed this and I could be wrong, but Sagan has looked just a little bit \u201coff\u201d in the early stages of this year\u2019s Tour judging by his usual ridiculously high standards of consistency. 102km to go: Elia Viviani is best of the rest in the intermediate sprint and is followed over the line by Peter Sagan and Michael Matthews. 103km to go: Uncontested, Simon Clarke sprints away from Tim Wellens, Mads Schmidt Wurtz, Toms Skujins and Simon Clarke to win the intermediate sprint and trouser the 20 points and \u20ac1,500 that come as his reward. That\u2019ll go into the team kitty. 106km to go: Just as Valverde is about to rejoin the peloton, he\u2019s forced to stop again and get a replacement bike. He seemed to be having problems with his rear derailleur, which sounds painful. Today\u2019s intermediate sprint will take place in Heiligenstein, in the Bas-Rhin department in Alsace in north-eastern France, which is 104 kilometres from the finish line. With 109 kilometres to go, Alejandro Valverde is forced to stop by a puncture. He gets a new wheel and sets off to catch up with the rest of his colleagues. The gap is 1min 36sec between the breakaway and the bunch. 115km to go: The gap from the breakaway to the bunch, where Team Sunweb and Bora Hansgrohe are doing the heavy lifting, is at a very manageable 1min 18sec. Global Cycling Network: Your reporter has to pull into the ditch, dismount and have a quick comfort break, so here to keep you amused during my short absence, are the GCN to take you behind the scenes at the Tour in the build-up to Saturday\u2019s Grand Depart. 13okm to go: Having asked his travelling companions nicely, Tim Wellens is allowed to be first over the first of four classified climbs to be negotiated today, the Cat Three Cote de Grendelbruch and takes two of the three King of the Mountains points available. Toms Skujins was second over and took one. 133km to go: The gap between the four-man breakaway and the peloton is 1min 54sec, but Peter Sagan\u2019s Bora Hansgrohe team are at the front of the bunch and keeping the escapees on a tight rein. Remember, Tim Wellens, who is in the breakaway, is wearing the King of the Mountains jersey and will be hoping to hoover up a few more points this afternoon. 139km to go: The race has settled down after a frantic start, which gives me time to check the General Classification. The Australian rider, Simon Clarke, is the highest placed of those in the breakaway. He\u2019s currently 73rd in the standings, 5min 04sec behind the maillot jaune Julian Alaphilippe. 146km to go: Four men escape, while plenty more who will have been ordered to make sure they got in any breakaway today will be resigned to having to face the wrath of angry directeurs sportifs later this evening. Chapeau then, to Messrs Wellens, Schmidt Wurtz, Skujins and Clarke. 153km to go: We finally appear to have our breakaway group. Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal), Mads Schmidt Wurtz (Katusha Alpecin), Toms Skujins (Trek-Segafredo) and Simon Clarke (EF Education First) make a break for it and are allowed to bolt into the distance. 154km to go: Our intrepid trio continue their escape bid, but are finally caught again. Thomas De Gent has expended plenty of energy in this stage already but is still in the pack. 157km to go: Thomas De Gendt (Lotto Soudal), Jan Tratnik (Bahrain Merida) and Beno\u00eet Cosnefroy (AG2R La Mondiale) open a gap of about 10 seconds on the chasing pack. 160km to go: It\u2019s been a frantic first 15 kilometres, particularly at the front of the peloton. Thomas De Gent leads another jailbreak with two co-conspirators, but it doesn\u2019t look like his third attempt to escape will be any more successful than his previous two. 162km to go: Patrick Konrad (Bora Hansgrohe), Nils Politt (Katusha Alpecin), Anthony Perez (Cofidis) and Tim Wellens (Lotto Soudal), among others, form an eight breakaway but are caught before I can finish identifying them and typing out their names. We\u2019re still waiting for the day\u2019s first successful escape. 167km to go: Wearing the polka dot jersey, Tim Wellens is one of four riders who puts some distance between themselves and the bunch. Aime De Gent and Alex Gougeard are with him. 168km to go: Thomas De Gent makes another escape bid but doesn\u2019t get away. The bunch remains intact, but is mightily strung out towards the front as assorted riders put the hammer down. 169km to go: Unwilling to let the breakaway escape, the peloton reels them in before they can snap the line and escape. 171km to go: The race has yet to settle and our seven breakaway riders have just been joined by an eighth, while four others are still trying to bridge. 174km to go: Seven riders have escaped and three others are trying to bridge the gap from the peloton. They\u2019re on the move: The riders have set off from Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges , where they were bid adieu by a huge crowd. Christian Prudhomme has emerged from the sunroof of his red Skoda, waved his yellow flag and racing has begun. Thomas De Gent and six other riders have immediately tried to make a break for it. No abandonments so far: With 650.6 kilometres behind the field after four stages, every single one of the 176 riders who started the 106th Tour de France on Saturday is all still racing. Mitchelton Scott\u2019s stage four diary Stage three\u2019s diary was soundtracked by David Gray and today it\u2019s Razorlight. Whoever is in charge of this Aussie team\u2019s social media department needs to have a word with themselves. Today\u2019s roll-out: The field will get moving out of Saint-Di\u00e9-des-Vosges at 12.25pm (BST) before getting the signal to begin racing from race director Christian Prudhomme some 10 minutes or so later. Lance Armstrong\u2019s The Move podcast He\u2019s certainly not everybody\u2019s cup of tea, but Lance Armstrong\u2019s stage-by-stage analysis on his Tour de France podcast is well worth the time of those prepared to look beyond his well documented past and accept that he might actually know what he\u2019s talking about. Armstrong isn\u2019t afraid to pull punches in his daily chats with his former team-mate George Hincapie and pal JB Hager. It often makes for very interesting listening indeed. The Breakaway Orla Chennaoui was posing the questions as Adam Blythe and Brian Smith picked over the bones of stage four on Eurosport yesterday. It was a show that will not have made for pleasant viewing for Team Jumbo-Visna and their sprinter Dylan Groenewegen, who got quite the savaging. Stage three review Elia Viviani sprinted to his maiden Tour de France stage victory, Julian Alaphilippe retained the yellow jersey and defending champion Geraint Thomas played down what some have described as the very sloppy loss of five seconds on the previous day. From William Fotheringham\u2019s stage-by-stage guide: Best described as Vosges-lite, skirting three sides of the massif with two second and two third category climbs to shake up the pack. There is a good chance that an early escape will stay away today as keeping a team chasing will be hard in the tough finale \u2013 two climbs in the final 35km \u2013 while behind the move the peloton will be whittled down to 30 or 40. A good day for a strong breakaway rider such as Thomas De Gendt or Matej Mohoric, one where the favourites will want to avoid losing time or expending too much energy, with day six in mind.",

Against a backdrop of looser monetary policy globally, declining US business confidence and stagnant capex, plus no end in sight to the US-China trade dispute, lower rates\u2014which tend to spur borrowing and business investment\u2014could help balance out the negative effects of slowing growth and an ongoing trade war.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the market\u2019s response to rate cuts may depend on how close we are to a recession.

The Fed chair says a proper review is needed, telling the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee: \u201cLibra raises many serious concerns regarding privacy, money laundering, consumer protection and financial stability. These are concerns that should be thoroughly and publicly addressed.\u201d Fed chair Jerome Powell is now delivering his testimony to the House. He\u2019s outlining how the economic outlook has weakened, citing how businesses are reluctant to invest when they\u2019re uncertain how issues such as trade will play out. Powell also insists he will serve a full term, despite speculation president Trump might force him out. Today\u2019s rally means the S&amp;P 500 has gained almost 20% since the start of 2019. My colleague Dominic Rushe explains why Wall Street has hit record highs today..... The US looks increasingly likely to cut interest rates for the first time in over a decade, the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, hinted on Wednesday. \u201cMany\u201d Fed officials now believe a weakening global economy and rising trade tensions have strengthened the case for a rate cut, Powell wrote in a report released ahead of his appearance before Congress later on Wednesday. Since Fed officials met last month, when they decided to hold rates steady, \u201cuncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the US economic outlook\u201d, he wrote. Powell has been under immense pressure from Donald Trump to cut rates. \u201cOur most difficult problem is not our competitors, it is the Federal Reserve!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter earlier this month, the latest in a series of unprecedented attacks on the independence of the Fed by a sitting president.... Here\u2019s the full story: We have a hat-trick! The Dow Jones industrial average has hit its own record high, at 26,971. The S&amp;P continues to hit new heights too, clambering over the 3,000 point mark, while the Nasdaq has ascended by over 1% into new heady heights. The tech-focused Nasdaq index has also just hit a new record high, rising over 8,176 points for the first time. Shares in technology stocks, miners and industrial companies are all rallying on Wall Street, on hopes that a rate cut will prop up the US economy and boost growth. Boom! The S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks has hit a new intraday record high. The index is up 15.4 points, or 0.5%, at 2,995 points for the first time ever, thanks to the imminent prospect of a US interest rate cut. Some traders are speculating that the Fed could wheel out the big bazooka, and cut US interest rates by 50 basis points (from 2.75% to 2.25%). A quarter-point cut looks more likely, though. Ding ding! Stocks are rising as the opening bell rings out on Wall Street, as investors welcome the prospect of a US rate cut. The Dow Jones industrial average and the broader S&amp;P 500 are both up around 0.4%, heading close to their record highs. Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics, predicts Powell will cut US interest rates three times in the next nine months - starting in a couple of weeks. Our expectations is that GDP growth will fall below 1% annualised in the second half of this year and, as a result, we expect the Fed to cut interest rates by an additional 25bp in both this December and March next year. That 75bp reduction is a little less than the 100bp currently priced in to futures markets. Richard Flynn, Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says investors are hoping that the Federal Reserve will cut rates astutely, and protect America from recession. Here\u2019s his take on Powell\u2019s testimony: \u201cRecession risk is rising, but markets are hoping that even a small rate cut later this month will keep a downturn at bay. Against a backdrop of looser monetary policy globally, declining US business confidence and stagnant capex, plus no end in sight to the US-China trade dispute, lower rates\u2014which tend to spur borrowing and business investment\u2014could help balance out the negative effects of slowing growth and an ongoing trade war. \u201cHowever, the market\u2019s response to rate cuts may depend on how close we are to a recession. If the economy holds up and the rate cuts are simply \u201cinsurance,\u201d stock markets could rally strongly. However, if the economy weakens, the market\u2019s rate-cut optimism could turn negative. With fed funds futures now discounting more than 100 basis points of easing by the end of next year, equities may be at risk if the economy\u2019s deterioration supports that much easing\u2014but also at risk if the Fed under-delivers.\u201d Wall Street has got the message.... Bad News is Good News again, it seems. Stocks, bonds and commodities have all risen, since Jay Powell\u2019s downbeat assessment of the US economy hit the wires. That\u2019s because a weak economic outlook justifies a cut in US interest rate, or possibly even two by the end of this year. It doesn\u2019t take much reading between the lines to conclude that Fed chair Powell expects to cut interest rates at the next FOMC meeting, at the end of this month. Jerome Powell is also concerned that Brexit could hurt the US economy. America\u2019s top central banker tells lawmakers on Capitol Hill: Uncertainties about the outlook have increased in recent months. In particular, economic momentum appears to have slowed in some major foreign economies, and that weakness could affect the U.S. economy. Moreover, a number of government policy issues have yet to be resolved, including trade developments, the federal debt ceiling, and Brexit. Jerome Powell also warns that US businesses are cutting investment, factories are slowing, and the US housing market is weakening. He tells Congress: While growth in consumer spending was weak in the first quarter, incoming data show that it has bounced back and is now running at a solid pace. However, growth in business investment seems to have slowed notably, and overall growth in the second quarter appears to have moderated. The slowdown in business fixed investment may reflect concerns about trade tensions and slower growth in the global economy. In addition, housing investment and manufacturing output declined in the first quarter and appear to have decreased again in the second quarter. Newsflash: America\u2019s top central banker has warned that the US economic outlook continues to be hurt by the weak global economy, and trade disputes. In closely watched testimony to Congress, Jerome Powell appears to be signalling that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates later this month. In prepared remarks for the House Committee on Financial Services, just released, Powell says that the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee (the FOMC) is leading towards a rate cut.....and recent data backs this up. He cites \u201cuncertainties\u201d, both on trade and the health of the world economy (obviously the two are linked!). Here\u2019s the key part of his statement. In our June meeting statement, we indicated that, in light of increased uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted inflation pressures, we would closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion. Many FOMC participants saw that the case for a somewhat more accommodative monetary policy had strengthened. Since then, based on incoming data and other developments, it appears that uncertainties around trade tensions and concerns about the strength of the global economy continue to weigh on the U.S. economic outlook. Inflation pressures remain muted. This is driving the dollar down, and nudging the US stock market higher in pre-market trading (Wall Street opens in just under an hour). Nearly time to hear from Fed chair Jerome Powell: Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research believe the UK economy will avoid a recession this year, despite the impact of Brexit uncertainty. After analysing May\u2019s GDP report, NIESR has concluded that the UK will probably contract by 0.1% in the April-June quarter (we get the data on August 9th). But they also expect growth of 0.2% in July-September, meaning the UK would avoid two consecutive quarterly contraction. Janine Boshoff, economist at NIESR\u2019s Macroeconomic Modelling and Forecasting team, said \u201cOur latest estimate implies that the economy will narrowly avoid a technical recession in the middle quarters of this year. That said, the latest ONS data and recent surveys suggest that the economy has lost considerable momentum since the first quarter. This reflects the impact of Brexit-related uncertainty and slower growth in the global economy outside of the United States. The near-term outlook for the UK economy continues to depend on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.\u201d. The UK isn\u2019t the only economy finding conditions tough.... Europe is also looking weak. The European Commission has just cut its eurozone growth forecast for 2020 to 1.4%, from 1.5% previously. 2019 is still expected to be weak, with growth of just 1.2% - dragged down by Germany and Italy. Here\u2019s the new forecasts, which also show the UK close to the bottom: Here\u2019s our news story on the UK GDP report for May: Encouragingly, PwC\u2019s chief economist John Hawksworth believes Britain is fending off the risk of a recession.... but agrees that Brexit is hurting the economy. Looking through the noise in the monthly data, underlying growth in the economy continues at an annualised rate of around 1-1.5%. This is below its long-term historical average rate of around 2%, but there are no signs yet that Brexit-related uncertainty has pushed the economy as a whole into recession, although it has clearly dampened business investment and the housing market.\u201d Professor Costas Milas of Liverpool University has dug into today\u2019s GDP report.... and concluded that the economy has slowed to a standstill. He tells me: Today\u2019s GDP reading is the type of statistic that will satisfy both supporters and opponents of Brexit. Brexit supporters will point out that it shows a 3-month rolling growth of 0.3% which is better than what experts expected. A closer look at the data, however, suggests zero 3-month growth rates for both April and May (inferred from this ONS dataset). Therefore, Brexit opponents will point out that the economy has come to a standstill. Whatever the interpretation, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt should avoid, at all costs, a no-deal Brexit because if it occurs, today\u2019s GDP figure will arguably be the last good news for quite a while. Here\u2019s the British Chambers Of Commerce\u2019s take: UK car production surged by nearly 25% in May, as factories returned to life after shutting down in April. That\u2019s a record-breaking surge, but unfortunately it still leaves the sector smaller than in March. Industry experts have warned that the government\u2019s botched Brexit plans have hurt carmakers, forcing bosses to bring forward their summer shutdowns to April, in case of a no-deal crisis. Major carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover, BMW and Peugeot all shut factories earlier than usual, creating expensive shutdowns that weren\u2019t actually needed once the Brexit deadline was hoofed into the autumn. TUC chief economist Geoff Tily is also concerned that Britain\u2019s service sector is weak: Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, is worried that Britain\u2019s services sector stagnated in May: \u201cThe deteriorating picture across the UK\u2019s service industries is of particular concern. Services provide us with a better indication of the economy\u2019s direction at this juncture, because they were less affected by stockpiling movements earlier in the year. The current statistics point to the UK economy grinding to a halt in Q2. \u201dFinancial services output has now been contracting for 15 consecutive months, with Brexit likely to inflict permanent damage on the sector\u2019s growth prospects. Weakness in retail and wholesale trade confirms recent surveys\u2019 prognosis that households are rethinking their spending plans. \u201cThe small rebound in manufacturing and construction in May is insufficient to compensate for the weaker trend in services, and we expect Q2 overall to see almost no growth from the previous quarter. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, says \u2018storm clouds\u2019 are gathering over the UK economy: Consumers and business remain hamstrung by Brexit uncertainty. For example yesterday the British Retail Consortium\u2019s report showed average sales growth weakened to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, which is the slowest increase since it began calculating growth in 1995. Sam Tombs of Pantheon Economics predicts that the economy stagnated in April-June, based on today\u2019s data covering the period up to May. Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, thinks Britain will avoid a full-blown recession this year. However, he also believes the economy contracted in April-June, because some economic activity was dragged into January-March as firms prepared for Brexit. He told clients this morning: Despite the 0.3% m/m rebound in monthly GDP in May, it looks as though the economy contracted by around 0.1% q/q in Q2. That would be the first contraction since Q4 2012, although before today\u2019s release we had expected a 0.2% q/q fall. There\u2019s clearly a risk of a recession (two consecutive quarterly contractions), but we\u2019re not expecting one. Economists are still concerned that the UK could have contracted in the last quarter, despite the pick-up in growth during May. James Knightley of ING fears that June\u2019s GDP report, due in a month\u2019s time, will be weak. Here\u2019s Howard Archer of the EY Item Club. Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\u2019s Kit Juckes warns that the economy is slowing: Journalists are also concerned. Tom Newton Dunn of The Sun suspects Britain\u2019s next prime minister may receive bad economic news: Helia Ebrahimi of Channel Four points out that carmakers saved the day in May: Although today\u2019s GDP figures are better than feared, the broad picture is that Britain\u2019s economy is only growing slowly. As this chart shows, the quarterly grow rate has dropped to 0.3% in March-May, down from 0.5% in the first quarter of this year. This table shows how British industry bounced back in May, growing by 1.4% after a grim April. But... the UK\u2019s so-called dominant service sector stagnated in May. That\u2019s a concern, as services companies make up around three-quarters of the economy The ONS has also revised up its estimate of growth in March. It now thinks GDP rose by 0.1%, not shrinking by 0.1% as previously thought. The UK economy picked up in May, as carmakers returned to work after shutting down in April. Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, explains: \u201cGDP grew moderately in the latest three months, with IT, communications and retail showing strength. Despite this, there has been a longer-term slowdown in the often-dominant services sector since summer 2018. The economy returned to growth in the month of May, following the fall seen in April. This was mainly due to the partial recovery in car production.\u201d BREAKING: The UK economy grew by 0.3% in the three months to May. At first glance, that\u2019s better than expected -- the economy may have picked up once the threat of a disorderly Brexit. In May alone, the economy also grew by 0.3%, according to the Office for National Statistics. More to follow.... Just time for a reminder that GDP is an imperfect measure, from Robert F Kennedy half a century ago: Tension is building in the City as investors await the UK GDP report, in just a few minutes.... Recruitment firm PageGroup has blamed Brexit uncertainty for a slump in UK income in the last quarter. The company says demand for headhunting senior positions has weakened, suggesting UK businesses are tightening their spending. It told the City: The UK, now 16% of the Group, declined 2.4%, with continued Brexit related uncertainty impacting candidate and client confidence.... Michael Page, which is focused on more senior opportunities and continued to be impacted to a greater extent by the uncertainty, declined 6%. Shares in PageGroup have slumped by 14%, after it also warned that profits will be at the lower end of expectations. Another sign of trouble ahead?.... Today\u2019s monthly GDP report is particularly significant as it covers the period around Britain\u2019s original Brexit deadline. March was dominated by Theresa May\u2019s failed attempt pass her Withdrawal Agreement, followed by MPs failure to agree an alternative plan. The can was then nudged into April, before being kicked Lucy Bronze-style into the autumn. Any boost from pre-Brexit stockpiling in March will have faded in the months afterwards, while businesses are still reluctant to invest. Kit Juckes of French bank Societe Generale fears today\u2019s report will bode ill.... April data were very weak, June PMIs were weak as well, so there\u2019s some room a bounce in the May numbers. But a small bounce will confirm that Q2 overall was very weak, with GDP probably falling. Blame Brexit uncertainty, which reached a level that is too heavy for the economy to carry. The pound has just hit a new six-month low against the euro, in a blow to Britons heading over the channel on holiday this summer. Sterling has dipped to \u20ac1.1096, its lowest level since 11 January. That means one euro is worth 90.1p, making European imports (and ice-creams on a Mediterranean beach) more expensive in pound terms. Connor Campbell of Spreadex says last night\u2019s debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt for the chance to run Britain hasn\u2019t helped the pound. Sterling continues to find itself in a bad way, with last night\u2019s televised Tory-off failing to lift the currency\u2019s spirits. Cable [the \u00a3/$ rate] is trapped at $1.245 for the first time in more than 2 years, while after a week or so of treading water against the euro, the pound is now at a fresh 6-month nadir, barely keeping its head above \u20ac1.11. My colleague Aditya Chakrabortty has written a piercing analysis of the state of the UK economy, and it\u2019s not cheerful reading. Here\u2019s a flavour: The most watched surveys of British businesses, released in the past few days, suggest the private sector is already shrinking. In the construction sector, which has just had its worst month since the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, they now talk of \u201cquicksand\u201d. Manufacturing has been pole-axed, while out in the much larger service sector things look utterly moribund. Last week, it was briefly cheaper for the British government to borrow over five years than for two \u2013 the first time that has happened since just before the death in 2008 of Lehman Brothers. Even in a world turned upside-down by central banks pumping hundreds of billions of dollars into money markets, that is usually taken as indicating that a sharp slowdown lies around the corner. This one will be nowhere near as disastrous as the crash of 2008-9; but it will underline how far the world remains lodged in the shadow of that crisis. \u201cThe early evidence suggests the UK is already in a recession and that we\u2019re just waiting for more data to prove it,\u201d says David Blanchflower. As a rate-setter at the Bank of England in 2008, he was one of the few policymakers to spot that crash coming; but when central bankers and government ministers did finally wake up, at least they had plenty of firepower to draw on. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. With Brexit unresolved, trade wars raging between Washington and Beijing, and the world economy slowing, this is a tough time for the UK. But could Britain actually be flirting with recession? A new healthcheck of the UK economy, due this morning, is likely to show that growth slowed sharply in the last few months. Economists predict today\u2019s report will show GDP only increased by 0.1% in the March-May quarter, down from 0.3% in February-April. That would fuel concerns that the economy may actually have contracted in the second quarter of this year (we\u2019ll find that out in a month\u2019s time). We already know that April was a rough month -- the UK economy shrank, as auto-makers shut down production in case of a no-deal Brexit. So industrial and manufacturing production should have bounced back in May as the car industry returned to work. Economists predict GDP increased 0.3% in May alone, having shrunk 0.4% in April and 0.1% in March. But the overall picture may not be encouraging, especially as Britain\u2019s trade deficit is expected to remain wide. Adam Cole of Royal Bank of Canada explains: This morning\u2019s monthly GDP release for May is important after pronounced weakness in April and given growing expectations that the economy as a whole contracted in Q2. Expectations are for most of April\u2019s decline to reverse in May (0.3% m/m after -0.4%) and RBC economists are slightly above the consensus. Nonetheless, the arithmetic is such that a further monthly increase of 0.5% or more would be needed in June to avoid a negative reading for the quarterly average..... Despite the monthly distortions around the original Brexit data, expect to hear increasing chatter about the UK being \u201con the cusp of recession\u201d if the data continue to add up to negative quarterly growth. Meanwhile the pound is hovering near a two-year low, as traders worry about the impact of Brexit uncertainty on the UK economy, and the threat of a Halloween no-deal if Boris Johnson becomes prime minister. Investors will also watch Capitol Hill later, where Fed chair Jerome Powell will testify to the House Financial Services Committee. He\u2019ll discuss the state of the US economy, and the chances of the interest rate cuts demanded by president Trump.

      "body": "<p>I have been in hospital in Redditch all week. My dad has not been well and I am proving myself to be a loyal but not especially competent carer, lacking as I do patience, bravery and basic organisational skills.</p> <p>Most of my experience of hospitals has been restricted to the big teaching institutions, such as King\u2019s College and University College hospitals in London, and the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham. I have friends who trained and work in these places, and several others who have been treated in them. I suppose if I had driven past the Alexandra hospital in Redditch at any time I would have sniffed at it. Who would want to work in a hospital like that? Who would want to be treated there, for heaven\u2019s sake?</p> <p>I pulled into the car park on Monday carrying my casual prejudices along with my dad\u2019s pyjamas. The <a href=\"https://www.worcsacute.nhs.uk/our-hospitals/alexandra-hospital-redditch\" title=\"\">building is somewhat unprepossessing</a>, tucked away near the fringes of the new town sprawl. As far as I could see, there were no parts of it named after famous alumni. There were no oil paintings, busts or statues of eminent physicians and surgeons who have plied their trade here. A sure sign of clinical mediocrity, I would have thought.</p> <p>But, having spent a few long days here, I have come across several people \u2013 clinicians, cleaners, whatever \u2013 who I would happily chisel statues of with my own bare hands, if I only knew how. I have no idea how the Alexandra rates in terms of facilities, waiting times, outcomes and whatnot, but I do know I wouldn\u2019t have Dad anywhere else. There is a self-help book you may have come across called The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. I understand the point the book makes, but this place has made me want to write a different one called The Absolutely Critical Importance of Giving a F*ck.</p> <p>I am generally in awe of doctors\u2019 expertise, with all their great learning, but to see how they really, actually care trumps the exam passes every time. Is their capacity to care examined? Does it wane in time? Can it be learned in the first place? And then there are the nurses who I must be spooking, as my eyes follow them around the ward all day, slack-jawed in wonder and admiration at their energy and quite relentless compassion. Time after time I hear them asked by patients to do things to which my response would certainly be: \u201cReally? Do I have to? Honestly, I\u2019d rather not, if it\u2019s OK with you.\u201d But they smile, chirp an improbably cheery \u201cOf course!\u201d and get on with it.</p> <p>Next to most beds sit friends and relatives, just being there. A patient across from us on the ward has had his wife by his side all day every day, radiating quite unspeakable tenderness. Hearing me praise the nurses, she just looked round, smiled and said: \u201cYou\u2019re a bloody brown nose, you are.\u201d And with that, she turned back to her bloke.</p> <p>As I was fighting the parking ticket machine last night, an old woman smoking in a wheelchair next to it said: \u201cOh, sorry bab, you won\u2019t get no joy out of that. It\u2019s buggered.\u201d Even she seemed to genuinely care.</p> <p>It\u2019s not for me to advise Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust on its branding, but I have a suggestion for the sign at the entrance: Alexandra hospital \u2013 where everybody definitely gives a f*ck.</p> <h2>Why everyone over the age of 55 should be taught how to lip-read</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d48e62c7ff41c78fdfac75a60c334c587e6d0fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d48e62c7ff41c78fdfac75a60c334c587e6d0fe/42_284_4047_2428/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An older person being taught sign language\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Older people should learn some form of sign language or lip-reading.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lokibaho/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It seems to me everything would be so much easier for all concerned at the hospital if most of the patients weren\u2019t so hard of hearing. All day long I see \u2013 and hear \u2013 nurses and doctors trying to convey pretty critical information with plainly limited success. Obviously, on wards with several beds the medics can\u2019t holler at their charges loudly enough for them to hear without everyone else in the ward \u2013 and other wards, and long corridors \u2013 hearing too. And most patients are too polite to seek clarification, for fear of taking up any more of the doctors\u2019 time.</p> <p>Hearing aids are obviously one answer, but in my family\u2019s experience it seems you need to spend a fortune to get anything decent, and we all live our lives with a discordant symphony of bleeps, squeaks and whistles singing in the background.</p> <p>Learning some sign language would help, but that requires both speaker and listener to have the same level of competence. I often wonder why lip-reading classes aren\u2019t compulsory \u2013 and free \u2013 for everyone on, say, their 55th birthday. It\u2019s not the whole answer, but what harm would it do any of us? We are all heading toward some level of deafness, after all, so let\u2019s get ourselves ready for it in every way we can.

      "bodyText": "I have been in hospital in Redditch all week. My dad has not been well and I am proving myself to be a loyal but not especially competent carer, lacking as I do patience, bravery and basic organisational skills. Most of my experience of hospitals has been restricted to the big teaching institutions, such as King\u2019s College and University College hospitals in London, and the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham. I have friends who trained and work in these places, and several others who have been treated in them. I suppose if I had driven past the Alexandra hospital in Redditch at any time I would have sniffed at it. Who would want to work in a hospital like that? Who would want to be treated there, for heaven\u2019s sake? I pulled into the car park on Monday carrying my casual prejudices along with my dad\u2019s pyjamas. The building is somewhat unprepossessing, tucked away near the fringes of the new town sprawl. As far as I could see, there were no parts of it named after famous alumni. There were no oil paintings, busts or statues of eminent physicians and surgeons who have plied their trade here. A sure sign of clinical mediocrity, I would have thought. But, having spent a few long days here, I have come across several people \u2013 clinicians, cleaners, whatever \u2013 who I would happily chisel statues of with my own bare hands, if I only knew how. I have no idea how the Alexandra rates in terms of facilities, waiting times, outcomes and whatnot, but I do know I wouldn\u2019t have Dad anywhere else. There is a self-help book you may have come across called The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck. I understand the point the book makes, but this place has made me want to write a different one called The Absolutely Critical Importance of Giving a F*ck. I am generally in awe of doctors\u2019 expertise, with all their great learning, but to see how they really, actually care trumps the exam passes every time. Is their capacity to care examined? Does it wane in time? Can it be learned in the first place? And then there are the nurses who I must be spooking, as my eyes follow them around the ward all day, slack-jawed in wonder and admiration at their energy and quite relentless compassion. Time after time I hear them asked by patients to do things to which my response would certainly be: \u201cReally? Do I have to? Honestly, I\u2019d rather not, if it\u2019s OK with you.\u201d But they smile, chirp an improbably cheery \u201cOf course!\u201d and get on with it. Next to most beds sit friends and relatives, just being there. A patient across from us on the ward has had his wife by his side all day every day, radiating quite unspeakable tenderness. Hearing me praise the nurses, she just looked round, smiled and said: \u201cYou\u2019re a bloody brown nose, you are.\u201d And with that, she turned back to her bloke. As I was fighting the parking ticket machine last night, an old woman smoking in a wheelchair next to it said: \u201cOh, sorry bab, you won\u2019t get no joy out of that. It\u2019s buggered.\u201d Even she seemed to genuinely care. It\u2019s not for me to advise Worcestershire acute hospitals NHS trust on its branding, but I have a suggestion for the sign at the entrance: Alexandra hospital \u2013 where everybody definitely gives a f*ck. Why everyone over the age of 55 should be taught how to lip-read It seems to me everything would be so much easier for all concerned at the hospital if most of the patients weren\u2019t so hard of hearing. All day long I see \u2013 and hear \u2013 nurses and doctors trying to convey pretty critical information with plainly limited success. Obviously, on wards with several beds the medics can\u2019t holler at their charges loudly enough for them to hear without everyone else in the ward \u2013 and other wards, and long corridors \u2013 hearing too. And most patients are too polite to seek clarification, for fear of taking up any more of the doctors\u2019 time. Hearing aids are obviously one answer, but in my family\u2019s experience it seems you need to spend a fortune to get anything decent, and we all live our lives with a discordant symphony of bleeps, squeaks and whistles singing in the background. Learning some sign language would help, but that requires both speaker and listener to have the same level of competence. I often wonder why lip-reading classes aren\u2019t compulsory \u2013 and free \u2013 for everyone on, say, their 55th birthday. It\u2019s not the whole answer, but what harm would it do any of us? We are all heading toward some level of deafness, after all, so let\u2019s get ourselves ready for it in every way we can. Thanks to the internet, I have already made a start on this project here on ward six lunatically mouthing away at my iPhone, attracting pitying looks from patients in the beds opposite. It passes the time. This sitting-by\u2013a\u2013hospital\u2013bed business is like what soldiers say war is all about: hours of tedium punctuated with occasional moments of terror. I\u2019ll mouth that to the head nurse when she next comes past. She\u2019s sick of the sound of my voice anyway.",

      "body": "<h2><strong>UNITED FRONT</strong></h2> <p>It is nearly four months since Manchester United lost 4-0 at Everton through a performance Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r could only describe as \u201cso bad I can\u2019t describe it\u201d and which Paul Pogba, a man well placed to judge, condemned as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of the club. Both agreed the best thing about the experience was that it gave United an excellent opportunity to prove their enduring class by bouncing back in style. They have not gone so far as to win a match since then, but they did hold Huddersfield to a draw in May and, after Cardiff inflicted another setback on the last day of the season, they went unbeaten throughout the Women\u2019s World Cup, the Epsom Derby, the Canadian Grand Prix and a good chunk of Wimbledon. If that doesn\u2019t keep the club\u2019s official ornamental hatstand suppliers happy, then Ed Woodward needs to have a serious word about reasonable expectations!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2019/jun/04/football-transfer-window-2019-every-summer-deal-from-europe-top-five-leagues\">Transfer window 2019 \u2013 every summer deal from Europe's top five leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mr Woodward did not comment when The Fiver shouted his name today at a bus driver who looked nothing like him, but who kept going around a roundabout again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Solskj\u00e6r, meanwhile, presented himself to more or less respectable members of the media on Wednesday to mark the beginning of United\u2019s flamin\u2019 tour of Australia, during which they will play against local outfit Perth Galahs and fellow formerly dominant English club Nasty Leeds, who, despite the forthcoming friendly, appear to have a radically different approach to preparing for the new season: while NL seem set to go into the new campaign having sold their best players, Manchester United\u2019s cunning plan apparently involves holding on to as many underperformers as possible, many of whom recently signed cashtravagant contracts.</p> <p>So far, the squad that staggered and sulked towards the end of last season has been reinforced by Daniel James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and the promise of a heartfelt piano recital by maestro Alexis S\u00e1nchez. \u201cDoing business in the football market is not going to be a quick fix overnight, and we have players here who I trust,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/10/manchester-united-are-under-no-pressure-to-sell-players-says-ole-gunnar-solskjr\">tooted Solskj\u00e6r</a>. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the market looking to do some business but we\u2019re patient,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re Manchester United, we don\u2019t have to sell and don\u2019t have to overpay. You have to have the right players at the right price and if you look at the squad we\u2019ve got now there are so many good players.\u201d It is true that some of those players will inevitably be older and wiser, some will be Jesse Lingard. And any United fans worried that Solskj\u00e6r might be a relatively unproven manager promoted beyond his ability by a flawed regime can at least console themselves with the knowledge that, whatever happens, they begin their Premier League campaign against Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea.</p> <h2>LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jul/10/senegal-v-benin-africa-cup-of-nations-quarter-final-live\">Join Paul Doyle from 5pm BST for hot and steamy MBM coverage of Senegal 2-1 Benin at Afcon 2019</a>.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY</h2> <p>\u201cMan, I got him \u2026 he\u2019s so cute\u201d \u2013 LA rapper Killa Fame puts a dent in his tough-guy image by falling under the spell of Daniel Sturridge\u2019s pilfered Pomeranian, after claiming that he has found Lucci.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1a422ea686abbf522525e65ddba449099085ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1a422ea686abbf522525e65ddba449099085ecc/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Pomeranian, earlier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Pomeranian, earlier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shannon Stapleton/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>FIVER LETTERS</h2> <p>\u201cBack in May, I suggested Notts County might find a way for things to get worse for themselves despite wondering how it could get any worse, what with losing their title as oldest Football League club in the world to their noisy neighbours over the river, manager turnover, being the most stressful club to support in the UK based on flirtations with and actual promotions and relegations, Big Alan, Little Alan and Juventus ditching the famous black and white stripes loaned to them by County.

      "bodyText": "UNITED FRONT It is nearly four months since Manchester United lost 4-0 at Everton through a performance Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r could only describe as \u201cso bad I can\u2019t describe it\u201d and which Paul Pogba, a man well placed to judge, condemned as \u201cdisrespectful\u201d of the club. Both agreed the best thing about the experience was that it gave United an excellent opportunity to prove their enduring class by bouncing back in style. They have not gone so far as to win a match since then, but they did hold Huddersfield to a draw in May and, after Cardiff inflicted another setback on the last day of the season, they went unbeaten throughout the Women\u2019s World Cup, the Epsom Derby, the Canadian Grand Prix and a good chunk of Wimbledon. If that doesn\u2019t keep the club\u2019s official ornamental hatstand suppliers happy, then Ed Woodward needs to have a serious word about reasonable expectations! Mr Woodward did not comment when The Fiver shouted his name today at a bus driver who looked nothing like him, but who kept going around a roundabout again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again and again. Solskj\u00e6r, meanwhile, presented himself to more or less respectable members of the media on Wednesday to mark the beginning of United\u2019s flamin\u2019 tour of Australia, during which they will play against local outfit Perth Galahs and fellow formerly dominant English club Nasty Leeds, who, despite the forthcoming friendly, appear to have a radically different approach to preparing for the new season: while NL seem set to go into the new campaign having sold their best players, Manchester United\u2019s cunning plan apparently involves holding on to as many underperformers as possible, many of whom recently signed cashtravagant contracts. So far, the squad that staggered and sulked towards the end of last season has been reinforced by Daniel James, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and the promise of a heartfelt piano recital by maestro Alexis S\u00e1nchez. \u201cDoing business in the football market is not going to be a quick fix overnight, and we have players here who I trust,\u201d tooted Solskj\u00e6r. \u201cWe\u2019re still in the market looking to do some business but we\u2019re patient,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re Manchester United, we don\u2019t have to sell and don\u2019t have to overpay. You have to have the right players at the right price and if you look at the squad we\u2019ve got now there are so many good players.\u201d It is true that some of those players will inevitably be older and wiser, some will be Jesse Lingard. And any United fans worried that Solskj\u00e6r might be a relatively unproven manager promoted beyond his ability by a flawed regime can at least console themselves with the knowledge that, whatever happens, they begin their Premier League campaign against Frank Lampard\u2019s Chelsea.

The Guardian has revealed that paramedics gave Charlie Rowley a drug to counter novichok poisoning when he fell ill at his flat in Amesbury on Saturday 30 June last year.

      "body": "<p>Antonio Caldara was just another composer in the history of the Italian baroque until the release of a recording of one of his large-scale choral works became an unexpected hit 20 years ago. That work, Maddalena ai Piedi di Cristo, was composed in Venice, where Caldara (1670-1736) began his career, and where he became one of the most prolific and celebrated composers of oratorios of his time.</p> <p>But after spells in Barcelona and Rome, Caldara spent the last two decades of his life in Vienna, becoming court composer to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI. He continued to provide music for the liturgy, but also composed much more opera, producing around 60 stage works during his tenure there, mostly full-scale works on which he collaborated with the two great librettists of that time, Pietro Metastasio and Apostolo Zeno.</p> <p>Nowadays, Caldara\u2019s operas are almost entirely forgotten.

      "bodyText": "Antonio Caldara was just another composer in the history of the Italian baroque until the release of a recording of one of his large-scale choral works became an unexpected hit 20 years ago. That work, Maddalena ai Piedi di Cristo, was composed in Venice, where Caldara (1670-1736) began his career, and where he became one of the most prolific and celebrated composers of oratorios of his time. But after spells in Barcelona and Rome, Caldara spent the last two decades of his life in Vienna, becoming court composer to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI. He continued to provide music for the liturgy, but also composed much more opera, producing around 60 stage works during his tenure there, mostly full-scale works on which he collaborated with the two great librettists of that time, Pietro Metastasio and Apostolo Zeno. Nowadays, Caldara\u2019s operas are almost entirely forgotten. La Serenissima\u2019s revival for Buxton international festival is one of them, Lucio Papirio Dittatore, was almost certainly the first time the work had been staged in Britain, and possibly the first modern outing for any Caldara opera here. Composed in 1719 for the emperor\u2019s name-day to a text by Zeno that is crammed with historical detail, it is set in the early days of Rome, when Lucio Papirio was the city state\u2019s dictator.

The report by lawyer Sharon Persaud is critical of the university\u2019s handling of the scandal, which erupted last year after the women discovered they had been the subject of violent sexual comments exchanged among a group of male undergraduates. Two of the men at the centre of the group chat were banned for 10 years but on appeal it was cut to one year, meaning they could return as students before the women had completed their studies. After a public outcry the university announced in February that the pair would not return, and launched the independent review.

Among Persaud\u2019s main recommendations are for \u201cthe incorporation of a clear, simple code of conduct into the student contract so that breach and its consequences are obvious\u201d, as well as making the complaints process fair for all parties. One of the female students targeted in the group chat said Warwick had taken a crucial step by issuing an apology.

But after appealing, the two men with the longest punishments had their terms changed to a single year, and in December the university rejected a complaint by the victims into the handling of the investigation, prompting a public outcry and protests by staff and students when it came to light this year. Persaud said: \u201cIt is clear from this narrative that the overwhelming view was that the university appeal process has let down the victims,\u201d as the reduced ban meant they risked encountering the men on campus despite earlier assurances by the university. She also said the appeal decisions and the university\u2019s handling of the controversy \u201chad a traumatic effect on the wider Warwick community\u201d. \u201cOne notable feature was the widespread acknowledgement that the chat \u2018could have happened anywhere\u2019 \u2013 ie that a parallel and deeply disturbing online world is now a norm of social function,\u201d Persaud wrote. Complaints of sexual misconduct and violence have been widespread on British university campuses. A Guardian investigation in 2018 found there were nearly 2,000 reports of sexual misconduct committed by students and staff in the previous seven years, and hundreds more where the perpetrator\u2019s identity was not recorded.",

      "bodyText": "Ursula von der Leyen, the nominee to lead the European commission, has signalled she will not reopen Brexit talks with the next British prime minister and stressed the \u201cprecious\u201d Irish backstop must be defended. She said she still hoped the UK would remain in the European Union, while indicating she had no intention to renegotiate the withdrawal deal agreed by Theresa May and EU leaders. \u201cI think it\u2019s a good deal, but it is your responsibility and your noble task to sort this out,\u201d she told a British Liberal Democrat MEP in the European parliament, in her first public comments on Brexit. In a thinly veiled message to the Tory leadership candidates Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson, Von der Leyen said the tone and attitude with which Brexit happens were crucial, adding: \u201cBrexit is not the end of something, Brexit is the beginning of future relations and it\u2019s of absolute importance that we have good cooperation.\u201d She also made it clear she opposed attempts by both men to reopen discussions on the backstop, the fallback plan to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. \u201cI think the backstop is of utmost importance and we absolutely know how crucial this nonexistent border is for you,\u201d she said in response to an Irish MEP. \u201cHaving the backstop in the Brexit deal is precious, important and has to be defended.\u201d Von der Leyen was addressing the European parliament\u2019s liberal group as part of a round of meetings with large political groups to rally support ahead of a vote on her appointment next week. After being backed by EU leaders Von der Leyen needs at least 376 MEPs to elect her as commission president. The current German defence minister is a member of the centre-right European People\u2019s party (EPP), so needs to win over some combination of socialists, liberals, greens or Eurosceptics. Von der Leyen, who would be the first woman to lead the EU executive, said she wanted an equal share of men and women as European commissioners. However, this depends on the EU\u2019s member states appointing women to be their commissioners \u2013 an appeal many ignored in 2014. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European commission takes office. Making her pitch to MEPs, Von der Leyen emphasised her green credentials while also arguing that the EU needed to be more assertive in the world \u2013 a traditional preoccupation of the centrist group. Her earlier meetings with the EPP, Eurosceptic group and socialists were not broadcast online. She pledged her full commitment to making the bloc climate neutral by 2050, saying this required tougher targets for 2030 as well as EU funds for countries that would otherwise struggle to make the green transition. Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary recently blocked an EU declaration for a net-zero carbon emissions target by 2050, and are angling for more money before signing up to any pledge. Speaking in a mix of English, French and German, Von der Leyen emphasised her European outlook, reminding MEPs she was born in Brussels and attended the city\u2019s European school with Dutch, German and French classmates. \u201cThat was my first impression of Europe,\u201d she said. She clarified her views on European defence, restating that national parliaments should continue to have the final say on sending men and women into dangerous situations. \u201cI prefer to speak about the army of the Europeans, not the European army,\u201d she said, citing as a model the existing cooperation between Dutch and German forces. Although it is expected Von der Leyen will be approved by the European parliament, she still faced sniping over the process of her appointment whereby she leapfrogged politicians who had declared bids to lead the commission before European elections. The Dutch MEP Sophie in \u2018t Veld asked whether she would be tougher in acting against violations of the rule of law and democracy than the outgoing commission, adding it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that Poland and Hungary had supported Von der Leyen\u2019s nomination. Von der Leyen answered \u201cyes\u201d and pointed out her appointment was backed by all countries, although Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, did not vote for her because of divisions in Germany\u2019s ruling coalition. In her opening remarks Von der Leyen said the rule of law was \u201cthe jewel in the crown of our work\u201d and that the EU needed a mechanism for upholding it in member states.",

      "bodyText": "The head of the civil service in Northern Ireland has warned against complacency over political limbo as an official report predicts that 40,000 jobs are at risk in the region in the event of a no-deal Brexit. David Sterling was accused of engaging in \u201coperation fear\u201d in March by a Brexiter Conservative MP after warning of the \u201cgrave\u201d consequences for the region. On Wednesday he said he had \u201cdeveloped a thick skin\u201d in the face of such criticism but that those fears still held. \u201cOur assessment is that no deal would have a profound and long-lasting impact on Northern Ireland and society, a point I made back in March and it remains valid today,\u201d said Sterling speaking at the Institute for Government in London. He said the uncertainty over Brexit was now affecting investment, with the latest local Purchasing Managers Index data showing the \u201cstrongest reduction in output since September 2012\u201d. He also said there would be an increase in smuggling on the border and community relations in those areas could deteriorate. No deal \u201ccould change the attitude in communities, which over time could have an impact in the culture of those areas\u201d, said Sterling. In a wide-ranging talk he also said the political impasse in Northern Ireland was not something the region could ignore. \u201cWhile tensions around parades had been in decline and there was \u201cless street disorder\u201d there were \u201cother societal tensions that are probably the result of the political impasse. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t want to overstate it but at the same time I wouldn\u2019t be complacent \u2026 it would wrong to be complacent and think this will be the same for evermore.\u201d Asked what police would be deployed to the border on 1 November in a no-deal scenario, he said: \u201cThe Police Service of Northern Ireland assessment has been and remains that new infrastructure on the border would be at risk of attack by republicans.\u201d He said the absence of Stormont has meant \u201cwe have lacked that ministerial voice in Whitehall that has championed the cause of Northern Ireland\u201d. Earlier on Wednesday the Northern Ireland Department for the Economy issued a report on investment under no deal warning it could \u201clead to a sharp increase in unemployment with at least 40,000 jobs at risk\u201d. The report said the impact of EU tariffs and non-tariff barriers would mean that whatever the Irish government and the EU do \u201cmany businesses will no longer be able to export to the Irish market, leading to a major reduction in NI\u2019s exports to Ireland\u201d, it said. Sterling warned that while some economic indicators such as employment and tourism were good in Northern Ireland it also suffered from low productivity, low wages, youth unemployment and high numbers of people who were economically inactive.",

But perhaps the most surprising thing is that the architects of the original High Line are behind it.</p> <p>\u201cWe were a bit sceptical about getting involved at first,\u201d says Ben Gilmartin, partner at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/oct/20/liz-diller-rebel-architect-moma-high-line-simon-rattle-centre-for-music\">Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a>. \u201cWe were originally approached to do an apartment tower, but we weren\u2019t in the business of designing commercial towers, so we proposed a public space masterplan instead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1984d8cefdaaa43ad79167c90e1f8830108d9a6a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1984d8cefdaaa43ad79167c90e1f8830108d9a6a/0_0_4032_2904/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Concrete jumble \u2026 the path, suspended on steel \u2018trees\u2019, winds through \u2018harlequin\u2019 air vents for the tube station below.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"720\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Concrete jumble \u2026 the path, suspended on steel \u2018trees\u2019, winds through \u2018harlequin\u2019 air vents for the tube station below.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was already a plan for a 5km running track around the site, but they brought a seductive sprinkle of DS+R fairy dust. Gilmartin describes their concept as akin to a \u201ccharm bracelet\u201d, a multilayered route that would link together the cultural flotsam already scattered around the site, from Antony Gormley\u2019s Quantum Cloud sculpture to Richard Wilson\u2019s sliced-open ship. \u201cThe idea was that anything that came along could plug in,\u201d he says. \u201cWe imagined it plugging into Ravensbourne, shooting up over the highway and plunging straight through the new shopping mall, as well as having an arm flying off into the new film studios.\u201d</p> <p>It was a similar concept to the City of London\u2019s postwar <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/02/walkways-in-the-sky-the-return-of-londons-forgotten-pedways\">Pedway plan</a>, except that, rather than each piece being built incrementally by a sequence of developers, this would all be built by the benevolent Knight Dragon \u2013 a company with a track record of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">changing its plans</a>. The film studio idea has since been axed and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/feb/02/santiago-calatrava-london-greenwich-peninsula-central\">the grand \u00a31bn centrepiece by Santiago Calatrava</a> \u2013 intended to be a combination of tube and bus station, with bars, shops and entertainment venues, as well as offices, hotels and apartments \u2013 is already being rethought.</p> <p>The first kilometre-long section of The Tide has just been unveiled and, so far, it doesn\u2019t quite live up to its claims of being a useful connective route. It begins at the unholy nexus of <a href=\"https://farrells.com/project/14-pier-walk-6-mitre-passage\">Terry Farrell\u2019s gaudily wrapped offices for Transport for London</a> and the swirling eyeful of <a href=\"https://www.dezeen.com/2010/09/13/ravensbourne-college-by-foreign-office-architects/\">Ravensbourne University</a>, the overwrought death rattle of Foreign Office Architects, completed shortly before they split up in 2010 and looking<strong> </strong>like a giant Connect 4 game dressed in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/may/29/dazzle-painting-a-history-of-nautical-camouflage\">dazzle camouflage</a>. In between these two hulks stands The Tide\u2019s first cluster of steel \u201ctrees\u201d, rising at jaunty angles to support the pedestrian deck above, with real trees sprouting from their splayed tops.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffc64ff0f17e3902a488fa7622be1fe5c6cee6a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffc64ff0f17e3902a488fa7622be1fe5c6cee6a1/0_430_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meditation corner \u2026 Yoko Ono\u2019s forlorn Wish Trees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meditation corner \u2026 Yoko Ono\u2019s Wish Trees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s basically trees with trees on top,\u201d says Gilmartin, explaining how the steel trunks contain the drainage, power and irrigation, while a combination of birch and pine poke through the decking above. Bearing the trademark DS+R digital streamlining, they look like platforms from a computer game, bio-sci-fi stalks with more than a touch of Thomas Heatherwick styling \u2013 recalling the fungal supports of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/28/garden-bridge-dead-38m-public-money-repaid-boris-johnson\">ill-fated Garden Bridge</a>, or the curvaceous concrete platforms of his <a href=\"http://www.heatherwick.com/project/pier55/\">Pier 55 park</a> in New York, currently under construction in the Hudson River, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/26/garden-bridge-pier-55-new-york-london\">a legal battle to stop it</a>.</p> <p>There are 28 steel stalks in all, manufactured by a boat-builder in Italy and shipped here up the river. They support a 250-metre long section of elevated walkway that weaves between a dense obstacle course of vents from the tube station below, terminating in a platform overlooking the Thames. Some of the vent shafts have been wrapped in colourful harlequin costumes by Morag Myerscough, while the biggest is encased in a building of its own, the Prism, designed by Neiheiser Argyros (who also co-designed The Tide) as a faceted mesh box containing a cafe, public loos and a big digital media screen, adding to the landscape of tortured geometries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"85117458184707aa1234be5f87765e04a18c219f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85117458184707aa1234be5f87765e04a18c219f/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Tide\u2019s view of the Thames, over what could be a performance space.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Tide\u2019s view of the Thames, over what could be a performance space.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Peters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you\u2019re standing on the elevated deck, looking out over a jumbled vista of vents and service hatches, it\u2019s difficult to work out quite how anyone thought this was a good idea. It has no purpose whatsoever, apart from providing a slightly different perspective on the surrounding carnage. A flight of raked steps suggests an area where performances might take place, while another section swoops down to form a protective bowl around a cafe terrace, but the point of being raised five-to-nine metres above the ground \u2013 over an area that is already pedestrianised \u2013 remains a mystery. After the short jaunt, you descend back to ground to join the remainder of the 1km route, which is simply the pre-existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/24/private-london-exposed-thames-path-riverside-walking-route\">Thames Path</a>, repaved and adorned with some new benches and canopies.</p> <p>Along the way are a number of seats fitted with \u201caudio meditation portals\u201d. Perhaps visitors might dwell here awhile, gaze out towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/apr/06/damien-hirst-treasures-from-the-wreck-of-the-unbelievable-review-titanic-return\">Damien Hirst\u2019s enormous bronze sea sculptures</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ollywainwright/status/1147211770681004032\">Yoko Ono\u2019s forlorn Wish Trees</a>, and meditate on how Knight Dragon acquired the land in 2012 at a knockdown price, after \u00a3225m of public money had been spent clearing the site, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/25/london-developers-viability-planning-affordable-social-housing-regeneration-oliver-wainwright\">soon set about reducing the agreed requirement for affordable housing on the basis of \u201cfinancial viability\u201d</a>, despite receiving a \u00a350m housing grant. Yet still they somehow managed to find a sizeable wodge of cash to build this superfluous viewing platform, a redundant green garnish to join the peninsula\u2019s infrastructural vanity projects.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2019.

But perhaps the most surprising thing is that the architects of the original High Line are behind it. \u201cWe were a bit sceptical about getting involved at first,\u201d says Ben Gilmartin, partner at Diller Scofidio + Renfro. \u201cWe were originally approached to do an apartment tower, but we weren\u2019t in the business of designing commercial towers, so we proposed a public space masterplan instead.\u201d There was already a plan for a 5km running track around the site, but they brought a seductive sprinkle of DS+R fairy dust. Gilmartin describes their concept as akin to a \u201ccharm bracelet\u201d, a multilayered route that would link together the cultural flotsam already scattered around the site, from Antony Gormley\u2019s Quantum Cloud sculpture to Richard Wilson\u2019s sliced-open ship. \u201cThe idea was that anything that came along could plug in,\u201d he says. \u201cWe imagined it plugging into Ravensbourne, shooting up over the highway and plunging straight through the new shopping mall, as well as having an arm flying off into the new film studios.\u201d It was a similar concept to the City of London\u2019s postwar Pedway plan, except that, rather than each piece being built incrementally by a sequence of developers, this would all be built by the benevolent Knight Dragon \u2013 a company with a track record of changing its plans. The film studio idea has since been axed and the grand \u00a31bn centrepiece by Santiago Calatrava \u2013 intended to be a combination of tube and bus station, with bars, shops and entertainment venues, as well as offices, hotels and apartments \u2013 is already being rethought. The first kilometre-long section of The Tide has just been unveiled and, so far, it doesn\u2019t quite live up to its claims of being a useful connective route. It begins at the unholy nexus of Terry Farrell\u2019s gaudily wrapped offices for Transport for London and the swirling eyeful of Ravensbourne University, the overwrought death rattle of Foreign Office Architects, completed shortly before they split up in 2010 and looking like a giant Connect 4 game dressed in dazzle camouflage. In between these two hulks stands The Tide\u2019s first cluster of steel \u201ctrees\u201d, rising at jaunty angles to support the pedestrian deck above, with real trees sprouting from their splayed tops. \u201cIt\u2019s basically trees with trees on top,\u201d says Gilmartin, explaining how the steel trunks contain the drainage, power and irrigation, while a combination of birch and pine poke through the decking above. Bearing the trademark DS+R digital streamlining, they look like platforms from a computer game, bio-sci-fi stalks with more than a touch of Thomas Heatherwick styling \u2013 recalling the fungal supports of his ill-fated Garden Bridge, or the curvaceous concrete platforms of his Pier 55 park in New York, currently under construction in the Hudson River, despite a legal battle to stop it. There are 28 steel stalks in all, manufactured by a boat-builder in Italy and shipped here up the river. They support a 250-metre long section of elevated walkway that weaves between a dense obstacle course of vents from the tube station below, terminating in a platform overlooking the Thames. Some of the vent shafts have been wrapped in colourful harlequin costumes by Morag Myerscough, while the biggest is encased in a building of its own, the Prism, designed by Neiheiser Argyros (who also co-designed The Tide) as a faceted mesh box containing a cafe, public loos and a big digital media screen, adding to the landscape of tortured geometries. When you\u2019re standing on the elevated deck, looking out over a jumbled vista of vents and service hatches, it\u2019s difficult to work out quite how anyone thought this was a good idea. It has no purpose whatsoever, apart from providing a slightly different perspective on the surrounding carnage. A flight of raked steps suggests an area where performances might take place, while another section swoops down to form a protective bowl around a cafe terrace, but the point of being raised five-to-nine metres above the ground \u2013 over an area that is already pedestrianised \u2013 remains a mystery. After the short jaunt, you descend back to ground to join the remainder of the 1km route, which is simply the pre-existing Thames Path, repaved and adorned with some new benches and canopies. Along the way are a number of seats fitted with \u201caudio meditation portals\u201d. Perhaps visitors might dwell here awhile, gaze out towards Damien Hirst\u2019s enormous bronze sea sculptures and Yoko Ono\u2019s forlorn Wish Trees, and meditate on how Knight Dragon acquired the land in 2012 at a knockdown price, after \u00a3225m of public money had been spent clearing the site, and soon set about reducing the agreed requirement for affordable housing on the basis of \u201cfinancial viability\u201d, despite receiving a \u00a350m housing grant. Yet still they somehow managed to find a sizeable wodge of cash to build this superfluous viewing platform, a redundant green garnish to join the peninsula\u2019s infrastructural vanity projects. \u2022 This article was amended on 11 July 2019.

The guys have shown a lot of heart throughout the campaign. It was a tough match and a great semi-final. Batting was really tough \u2013 we had to assess the conditions, because at the start I think both sides thought it would be a much higher-scoring game. We spoke about trying to get 240-250. We thought if we did that we\u2019d be right in the game.</p> <p>\u201cIt was really nice to get some early wickets. We wanted them to put the ball in good areas and move the ball in the air or off the team, and the guys were able to do that. It was a great start, and then as it slowed up we knew it would be a tough squeeze. For a while they looked likely to win it, but the heart we showed \u2013 with the ball and in the field \u2013 was outstanding.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve seen conditions vary throughout the matches.

      "bodyText": "The book will always say that New Zealand beat India by 18 runs in the first semi-final of the 2019 World Cup. But you\u2019d need thousands and thousands of words to tell the full story of a marvellous, nuanced match. It placed unreasonable demands on the brain, gut, heart, nerves, eyes and soul - and that\u2019s just for the neutral supporters. At the end of it all, New Zealand are in the World Cup final again. It\u2019s often said that you need to lose one to win one, and New Zealand will hope that\u2019s the case. One thing\u2019s for sure: anyone who thinks, consciously or otherwise, that tomorrow\u2019s match between Australia and England is a de facto final needs to give their head a wobble. Thanks for your company and emails throughout this memorable two-day ODI. I\u2019ll leave you with a match report from Old Trafford - bye! \u201cI have family spread throughout NZ and we all stayed up and communicated through WhatsApp,\u201d writes Judy. \u201cWell done Black Caps. Guppy you have redeemed yourself as even though your batting was off, your fielding was ON.\u201d Here\u2019s Kane Williamson \u201cIt\u2019s a different feeling from four years ago \u2013 the surfaces, and the way we\u2019ve had to try and skin it, has been quite different to the last World Cup. The guys have shown a lot of heart throughout the campaign. It was a tough match and a great semi-final. Batting was really tough \u2013 we had to assess the conditions, because at the start I think both sides thought it would be a much higher-scoring game. We spoke about trying to get 240-250. We thought if we did that we\u2019d be right in the game. \u201cIt was really nice to get some early wickets. We wanted them to put the ball in good areas and move the ball in the air or off the team, and the guys were able to do that. It was a great start, and then as it slowed up we knew it would be a tough squeeze. For a while they looked likely to win it, but the heart we showed \u2013 with the ball and in the field \u2013 was outstanding. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen conditions vary throughout the matches. While we didn\u2019t play our best cricket in the games we lost, there were other factors to consider as well, so we didn\u2019t get too disheartened. We knew if we played our best cricket we had a chance.\u201d Here\u2019s the Indian captain Virat Kohli \u201cWe were very, very good in the field \u2013 spot on. We thought we had restricted them to a total that was quite chaseable on any surface. But the way they bowled in that first half hour was the difference in the game. We felt like we had the momentum and the right mindset. The credit has to go to the New Zealand bowlers, because with the new ball they were outstanding. The skill level was clear to everyone and they made life very difficult for the batsman. \u201c[Jadeja] had an outstanding game. He went out with so much clarity and turned the game round in no time. MS had a good partnership. It\u2019s a game of margins. We\u2019ve played such good cricket, and 45 minutes of bad cricket puts you out of the tournament. It\u2019s difficult to accept, it\u2019s difficult to come to terms with, but, look, New Zealand deserve it. They were sharper and braver when it came to the crunch moments.\u201d \u201cThe more I see that Guptill throw,\u201d says Siddharth Singh, \u201cthe more it like a finishing move from Mortal Kombat.\u201d When you consider the context - of the match, and the tournament he\u2019s had - I reckon that\u2019s the champagne moment of the World Cup so far. Happy birthday to Danielle Tolson, who sent this email after approximately 47.4 overs. \u201cIn the course of this game I have aged at least a year. Literally, as overnight here in NZ it has ticked in to being my birthday. Before the game resumed, I said I\u2019d be happy whoever won as long as it was a decent game. Instead I\u2019m sitting in the middle of the night in the middle of winter with a face like a twisted jandal*. I think my birthday resolution this year might be giving up cricket.once &amp; for all. Again. *jandal is the correct word for flip-flop.\u201d Matt Henry is the Player of the Match \u201cWe wanted to start off well with the ball and create as much pressure as we could. We had to ask a lot of questions \u2013 we knew it wasn\u2019t the easiest wicket to bat on. We\u2019ve always got belief. We knew we had to bowl really well. They\u2019re very dangerous down the order so we knew that to win this game we\u2019d have to get [Jadeja and Dhoni] out. It\u2019s a pretty special moment and we\u2019re looking forward to Lord\u2019s. That was the best World Cup semi-final since, well, 2015. But it was a bona fide classic - subtle as a Test match at times, unbearably dramatic at others - and you can read all about it here. The New Zealand players almost look like they have lost the game. It must be emotional exhaustion, the same as Australia experienced after their semi-final against South Africa in 1999, and perhaps a bit of disbelief as well. It should sink in any second now. The last wicket came when Chahal edged a loopy slower ball to Latham. He went upstairs, presumably on the might-as-well principle, but there was a spike and the decision was upheld. This is a sensational win for New Zealand. Nothing can top the emotion of the 2015 semi-final, at least not until Sunday, but right here, right now, you could argue this is their greatest ever World Cup victory. WICKET! India 221 all out (Chahal c Latham b Neesham 5) New Zealand have beaten India by 18 runs in an immense semi-final, and Kane Williamson is still walking round with a resting heart rate! This should be the game. 49.2 overs: India 221-9 (Chahal 5, Bumrah 0) Chahal edges Neesham\u2019s slower ball this far short of Latham. It doesn\u2019t matter for New Zealand. 49.1 overs: India 221-9 (Chahal 5, Bumrah 0) The first ball is filth, and Chahal tickles it fine. 19 from 5 for the mother of all miracles. Ferguson cleaned Kumar up with a stunning slower ball that turned like a leg-break to hit the stumps. India need 23 from the final over - or, to put it another way, New Zealand are in the World Cup final. Bowled him! 48.4 overs: India 216-8 (Kumar 0, Chahal 0) A dot ball! A magical dot ball for New Zealand. India need 24 from eight balls. Dhoni shovelled the ball into a gap on the leg side and tried to steal a second. Guptill charged in from deep backward square, picked up and hit the stumps with a blistering throw. It went upstairs and replays showed Dhoni was just short. What a piece of fielding from Guptill. The man who has had an absolute dog of a tournament has just put New Zealand in the final! He\u2019s out! MS Dhoni is out! I think this is out! 48.2 overs: India 215-7 (Dhoni 49, Kumar 0) Dhoni cuts Ferguson\u2019s first ball for six! It just cleared the man on the rope, but it did clear him, and India are back in this. But the next one is a dot ball. This is pulsating stuff. 48 overs: India 209-7 (Dhoni 43, Kumar 0) Dhoni pulls Boult\u2019s last ball for a single, turning down a second. India need 31 from 12 balls. Jadeja clouted Boult a million miles in the air, literally, and for the second time today Williamson claimed a nerve-shredding catch with inhuman serenity. Jadeja played a staggering innings \u2013 77 from 59 balls, with four fours and four sixes. India need 32 from 13 balls. Gone! 47.4 overs: India 208-6 (Dhoni 43, Jadeja 76) Another single. Dhoni knows. Right? 47.3 overs: India 207-6 (Dhoni 42, Jadeja 76) A fantastic yorker from Boult is dug out for a single by Jadeja. 33 from 15. 47.2 overs: India 206-6 (Dhoni 41, Jadeja 76) Boult stops in his delivery stride, presumably because he lost his run-up. He runs in again, and Dhoni pats a single to mid-off. Dhoni is either a twisted genius or \u2026 not. 47.1 overs: India 205-6 (Dhoni 40, Jadeja 76) Williamson gambles by using Trent Boult\u2019s final over right here, right now. Dhoni, strokeless for so long, pulls viciously for two. It would have been four but for a great stop by Santner. 47 overs: India 203-6 (Dhoni 38, Jadeja 76) And he does. Dhoni takes a single, which makes it five from the over. India need 37 from 18 balls. Henry finishes with 10-1-37-3. 46.5 overs: India 202-6 (Dhoni 37, Jadeja 76) Jadeja steers to short third man for a single. This will be a fine over from Henry, if he can get out unscathed. 46.4 overs: India 201-6 (Dhoni 37, Jadeja 75) Dhoni plays tip-and-run again. A single. 46.3 overs: India 200-6 (Dhoni 36, Jadeja 75) Jadeja flaps a slower bouncer for a single. 46.2 overs: India 199-6 (Dhoni 36, Jadeja 74) A swing and a miss from Jadeja. 41 from 22 needed. Yes, yes I know technically I should have typed \u2018forty-one\u2019 as it was the first word of a sentence, but now\u2019s not the time! 46.1 overs: India 199-6 (Dhoni 36, Jadeja 74) Matt Henry, whose new-ball burst feels an age ago, comes on to bowl his final over. Dhoni takes a single to backward point to get Jadeja on strike. He\u2019s not a finisher today; he\u2019s a facilitator. 46th over: India 198-6 (Dhoni 35, Jadeja 74) New Zealand are desperate for a wicket from Boult. They don\u2019t get it \u2013 and India pilfer 10 more invaluable runs! There was one boundary, an edge from Jadeja that raced past the keeper Latham. Jadeja has had a few bits of luck in the last 20 minutes. But it has been an immense innings. India need 42 from 24 balls - or 41 for a Super Over. There\u2019s only one thing for it: the OBO is dead, long live the BBB. Thanks Simon, hello everyone. Trent Boult is returning to the attack. 45th over: India 188-6 (Dhoni 33, Jadeja 66) Ferguson\u2019s ninth over starts with a brilliant yorker, then a single, then two, and then Jadeja sees a slow ball coming, bides his time and then lifts one over long-off for six! \u201cThis is thrilling, see-saw cricket,\u201d writes Guy Hornsby, \u201cbut it\u2019s like this pair are batting totally different games. When will MSD play the situation? Unless he\u2019s waiting to blast 50 off the last 5. That seems an immense gamble to take.\u201d India need 52 from 30 balls. At this point I\u2019m going to hand over to Rob Smyth, who\u2019s going to take you through the denouement and its aftermath. Emails to him here please, if you would. 44th over: India 178-6 (Dhoni 30, Jadeja 59) Ugh! Jadeja lifts the ball to Taylor at short fine leg, but it lands just short! And then he hits Henry\u2019s slower delivery straight to Henry at long on, but again it drops just short! Incredible double-survival let-off madness! If he just wanted to dispirit his opposition at this key juncture, he couldn\u2019t have placed those balls better. India need 10.33 an over. 43rd over: India 170-6 (Dhoni 29, Jadeja 53) That\u2019s an excellent over from Ferguson, which yields three singles. 42nd over: India 168-6 (Dhoni 28, Jadeja 52) Neesham and De Grandhomme have been the weakest of New Zealand\u2019s bowlers, but with only five outstanding from Boult, Henry and Ferguson they need one or both of them to stand up here. Neesham gets his chance, and Jadeja pulls the ball viciously through midwicket; Ross Taylor was there to stop it inside the circle, but was undone by a nasty bounce. Two off the next takes Jadeja to his first ODI half-century for five years, and the crowd is buzzing again now as belief courses back through Indian veins. 41st over: India 159-6 (Dhoni 27, Jadeja 45) Jadeja attacks again, lifting the ball over cow corner for six! Then the last is chipped to midwicket, but drops just short! That\u2019s the last we\u2019ll see of Santner, who\u2019s bowled out. His 10 overs have cost 34 runs and brought two wickets, and been generally excellent. 40th over: India 150-6 (Dhoni 24, Jadeja 39) Ferguson\u2019s back, and Jadeja gloves his first delivery down the leg side. Latham dives to his right but can\u2019t reach it, and it\u2019s away for four! Another first-ball nearly moment for Ferguson, though the delivery wasn\u2019t up to much. The growing feeling is that New Zealand need a wicket, with Jadeja so far judging his innings perfectly and Dhoni, well, Dhoni. Nine off the over, which is precisely what India need from here on in. 39th over: India 141-6 (Dhoni 23, Jadeja 32) Santner has conceded a boundary now, and it\u2019s a massive six over long-on from Jadeja. India need precisely 99 runs now, off 11 overs, and the tension isn\u2019t lifting any time soon. 38th over: India 131-6 (Dhoni 22, Jadeja 24) Matt Henry\u2019s ninth over. Jadeja hoists one over midwicket for a one-bounce four. The bowler then goes slow and short, and then faster and full, and Jadeja can\u2019t read either of them. A single off the last, though, and Jadeja had 24 at precisely a run a ball: no other Indian batsman has scored at a strike rate above 57, and after scoring 22 off 44 Dhoni\u2019s is exactly 50. 37th over: India 126-6 (Dhoni 22, Jadeja 19) Santner\u2019s eighth over, and nobody has scored a boundary off him yet. This over goes one-dot-one-dot-one-dot, like Long John Silver on his morning stroll. 36th over: India 123-6 (Dhoni 21, Jadeja 17) Oooof! Henry replaces Boult, and coaxes the ball through an invisible gap between Dhoni\u2019s bat and body, the ball just clearing the stumps. Then there\u2019s a little noise as the last delivery goes through to the keeper, but nobody\u2019s very excited about it; presumably it was a pad. India need 8.35 an over from here. 35th over: India 119-6 (Dhoni 20, Jadeja 15) Santner returns, and Jadeja and Dhoni do some fine running, though a very slightly better throw to Santner might have had Jadeja in trouble after he was ordered to turn back by his team-mate, rather than go for a second. \u201cSo the ICC arrange an entire World Cup model, and eliminate many other countries from even playing for the benefit of India staying in as long as possible,\u201d writes Darnel Harris, \u201cand they ... do this?\u201d 34th over: India 114-6 (Dhoni 19, Jadeja 11) Ye olde win predictor gives New Zealand a 94% chance of winning at the start of Boult\u2019s eighth over. Dhoni drives down the ground for four. \u201cAfter seeing Kohli\u2019s scores in KO stages, it reminds me of North American Sports. In North American sports like NHL, NBA, NFL, MLB if you don\u2019t deliver in the playoffs than you are not the GOAT or they say you don\u2019t have the clutch gene. Or you can\u2019t handle pressure etc,\u201d writes Humming Bird. \u201cWhat do you think of Kohli in this regard?\u201d Obviously I think he\u2019s brilliant, but those statistics are starting to look telling. 33rd over: India 106-6 (Dhoni 14, Jadeja 9) Six runs! Neesham replaced Santner, and Jadeja clobbers him down the ground. The over ends with a bonus run, as the fielder\u2019s throw hits the wicket with the batsmen having settled for a single and deflects far enough away to let them scamper another. 32nd over: India 97-6 (Dhoni 12, Jadeja 2) Boult returns; the required run rate rises. They\u2019re surely not going to meander out of the World Cup at three runs an over? 31st over: India 94-6 (Dhoni 10, Jadeja 1) Santner has pretty much delivered the same ball 36 times in his six overs. A couple of hours ago I read a suggestion on Twitter that Williamson might be refraining from bowling him for fear that he would be slogged around the ground. Now he\u2019s taken two wickets for seven runs in six overs. \u201cWhat would happen if the scores are tied at 50 overs on 239 for 8?\u201d asks Kim Thonger. \u201cThe match between the two sides in the group stage was abandoned without a ball being bowled. Would it be decided on the toss of a coin?\u201d The head-to-head record isn\u2019t used in any circumstances: I believe India would go through because of their superior record in the group stages it would go to a super over (thanks Andrew Howard for clarification). Hardik Pandya top-edges a wild slog and Williamson runs back at midwicket to collect the ball as it comes down from orbit! 30th over: India 92-5 (Pandya 32, Dhoni 10) Pandya keeps rubbing the small of his back. He has already needed the physio on in this innings to hand over a pill, presumably a painkiller. So that doesn\u2019t help. Seven off Neesham\u2019s fourth over, the first in 10 overs to go for more than four (and they only did that once). And India do indeed need exactly 148 from 20 overs! \u201cDhoni resembles more than anything else a tired old general fighting the last war,\u201d writes Sankaran Krishna. \u201cThis tuk-tuk approach ratchets up the pressure on poor Hardik and any non-striker - followed by a headrush dismissal and then Dhoni\u2019s inability to deliver in the final push. Sad.\u201d 29th over: India 85-5 (Pandya 30, Dhoni 5) Dhoni has faced 20 deliveries for his five runs. He is spectacularly unflustered. 28th over: India 83-5 (Pandya 30, Dhoni 3) Pandya turns to Ferguson after ducking his way out of a bouncer, smiles and gives him a thumbs up. That\u2019s good sport. The required run rate is now above 7 (7.13, to be precise). \u201cLooks like India are trying to get to 91 after 30 overs, just so they can chase down 148 from 20 and prove a point,\u201d says Samuel. 27th over: India 82-5 (Pandya 30, Dhoni 2) Santner has conceded three runs in four overs, but he\u2019s on the slide: two maidens to start, but two runs off this one alone. He\u2019s practically falling apart. \u201cA friend outside the ground has been told despite them having thousands of tickets, they can\u2019t sell them to walk-ups,\u201d reports Tom Watkins. \u201cCricket doesn\u2019t really help itself does it?\u201d 26th over: India 80-5 (Pandya 29, Dhoni 1) The required run rate is approaching seven. India have scored 10 in the last seven overs. \u201cCan we revert to chasing 148 from 20 overs? Asking on behalf of a friend,\u201d writes Deepak Puri. 25th over: India 77-5 (Pandya 26, Dhoni 1) Santner\u2019s third over sees him concede his first run. There\u2019s also a leg bye. New Zealand currently at 80% on the win predictor. 24th over: India 75-5 (Pandya 25, Dhoni 1) Crikey, the tension. MS Dhoni can get this done. He can also go at three an over until it\u2019s too late to change direction. Let\u2019s see. 23rd over: India 71-5 (Pandya 22, Dhoni 0) India had scored one run from the 16 balls that preceded the wicket. Santner had bowled 10 successive dots. Finally Pant decided that drastic action had to be taken, and that was the last decision he\u2019ll have to take today. Thus this becomes the third wicket maiden of the innings. The partnership is broken! Pant tries to hoist Santner over midwicket but he doesn\u2019t get enough on it, and De Grandhomme takes a straightforward catch! 22nd over: India 71-4 (Pant 32, Pandya 22) A single off Neesham, and the required run rate is above six for the first time today. I must say that an impressive number of yesterday\u2019s ticket-holders have managed to wangle another free day in Manchester, with significant gaps visible only in the giant Foster\u2019s Party Stand. 21st over: India 70-4 (Pant 31, Pandya 22) Had play started at 6.30pm last night, India would have had to score 148 in 20 overs. Now they\u2019re at less than half that total after 21. Santner bowls for the first time, and it\u2019s a maiden. 20th over: India 70-4 (Pant 31, Pandya 22) Pandya clips to Ferguson at long leg and goes for two. It would have been the end of him, had Ferguson\u2019s throw been more accurate, or more flat of trajectory. Then Pant gets a thick edge on the last, which runs to the third man boundary. 19th over: India 62-4 (Pant 27, Pandya 19) Ferguson\u2019s first balls are incredible. This time it rises sharply over Pant\u2019s dangling bat. \u201cThis innings reminds me of when my brother beat the shit out of me when I was little, and I asked him to stop, but he didn\u2019t,\u201d writes Subhankar Pasalapudi (a couple of overs ago, to be fair, before this pair started making life look just a little less dismal for India). 18th over: India 60-4 (Pant 25, Pandya 19) De Grandhomme is milked like an old dairy cow. Nine off the over in ones and twos (plus a wide). 17th over: India 51-4 (Pant 24, Pandya 12) Having nearly got a wicket with the first ball of his first over, Ferguson nearly gets another with the first ball of his third. Pandya completely mistimes a pull shot and top-edges just over the head of the fielder at midwicket! \u201cI\u2019d like to take issue with your publication of Asif Gil\u2019s mails (overs 14 and 15),\u201d writes Ant Pease. \u201cSince when has the OBO been a home for poorly typed gibberish from the public?\u201d 16th over: India 47-4 (Pant 23, Pandya 10) Colin de Grandhomme replaces Henry, and when Pandya cuts the ball firmly Martin Guptill dives high to his left to get his palm on the ball; he doesn\u2019t hold it, but he does turn four runs into one. 15th over: India 43-4 (Pant 20, Pandya 9) One run from Ferguson\u2019s second over. India need 5.6 an over from here on in. Asif Gil emails again. \u201crrrrrrr4 thee,\u201d he says. I think his phone might be broken. 14th over: India 42-4 (Pant 19, Pandya 9) Pandya times one past cover, where the fielder dives but misjudges the bouncing ball and so can\u2019t stop it going for four. \u201cI am ga gyrrrrrrr4crtrtrrrweswrr rsseeeederregwvydseytt a rrrrrrr4crtrtrrrweswsseeeederregwvv,\u201d writes Asif Gil. I know how you feel, Asif. 13th over: India 37-4 (Pant 19, Pandya 5) DROPPED! Lockie Ferguson\u2019s first delivery is hit by Pant straight to Neesham, author of a world-class catch but minutes ago, at short midwicket. It comes at him fast, for sure, but that was a pretty ho-hum, run-of-the-mill catch, chest high, just to his right. 12th over: India 35-4 (Pant 18, Pandya 4) Rishabh Pant is playing a different game to everybody else, going at not far off a run a ball and looking pretty untroubled doing so. He pulls one for four, and then pushes through cover. Santner dives to his left to stop it, and returns the ball so quickly that what seemed a straightforward single ends the batsman desperately diving to make his ground. 11th over: India 30-4 (Pant 13, Pandya 4) Boult keeps going, this the sixth over of his spell, and it ends with a leg-side wide, and then another that is heading in a similar direction until Pandya tickles it away for four. The win predictor now gives New Zealand a 65% chance of victory. 10th over: India 24-4 (Pant 12, Pandya 0) Another boundary, Pant hitting a lovely shot through the covers. There\u2019s some encouragement here for India\u2019s batsmen, but they\u2019re not sticking around long enough to exploit it. The wicket falls from the last ball of the powerplay: prior to today India had lost four wickets in the opening 10 overs across the entire tournament; they\u2019ve now equalled that total in less than an hour. What a grab! Diving low to his left, with his arm fully extended, Jimmy Neesham plucks the ball out of the air about an inch from the ground, and then manages to pivot his hand so it protects the ball from the turf! Phenomenal! 9th over: India 19-3 (Pant 7, Karthik 6) Runs for Karthik! He finally gets off the mark, from his 21st delivery, as he works one between third slip - that\u2019s right, three slips - and point and gets four for it. And then a couple off the last for good measure. 8th over: India 13-3 (Pant 7, Karthik 0) Karthik has faced 16 balls so far, for his zero. None, though, in this over. India now need 5.4 an over, and it\u2019s rising fast. \u201cI think someone should go and check in on the Win Predictor algorithm - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s very well,\u201d says Harry Lang. \u201cI just saw it suggest, obviously in the throws of malfunction, that India were still 70% favourites whilst seemingly leaning over a precipice wearing banana skin slippers. Surely someone needs to switch it off and on again?\u201d 7th over: India 10-3 (Pant 5, Karthik 0) Another maiden from Boult, who has one wicket for three runs from four overs. It ends with a gorgeous inswinging yorker, which doesn\u2019t quite inswing enough. 6th over: India 10-3 (Pant 5, Karthik 0) Four! India\u2019s first boundary comes as Pant works the ball past point, and with almost every fielder in the circle once it\u2019s through, it\u2019s gone. India still have a 70% chance of victory according to the win predictor, down from 98% at the start of the innings. \u201cWell, we always wondered what\u2019d happen if a team managed to get through India\u2019s top 3 early,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cand here we are. It\u2019s happened to everyone else, but not with a spot in the final at stake. Can Pant play that innings? Game absolutely, vitally, on.\u201d 5th over: India 6-3 (Pant 1, Karthik 0) Boult bowls a tempter across Karthik, similar to the delivery from Henry that did for Sharma, but this time the batsman leaves it. Then Pant raises his bat to a ball that comes back into him and, as he goes down on one knee, clips his chest on its way through. There\u2019s a loud lbw appeal, but a shake of the head from the umpire, and no review. This is the first time in the entire history of ODI cricket that the top three batsmen have all been out for one run. 4th over: India 5-3 (Pant 0, Karthik 0) Another wicket maiden, as India falter in the face of Boult and Henry\u2019s early-innings assault. \u201cEveryone has talked about Boult in the build up to this morning, they seem to have forgotten Henry took 75 wickets at 15.48 in the CC last season, most of which were in very similar conditions to this,\u201d notes Chris Parker. Another edge, and an easy catch for Latham! Scenes! 3rd over: India 5-2 (Rahul 1, Pant 0) Kohli goes after Boult\u2019s first ball, but gets nothing on it as it whistles well wide of off stump. Two dots follow, and then another ball Kohli gets nothing on, and this one would have hit the stumps! Kohli\u2019s average in three World Cup semi-finals is 3.66. Wicket maiden. What. A. Start. The ball would have clipped the bails on its way through, and India\u2019s captain has gone! It looked a very good shout to me. This is massive ... 2nd over: India 5-1 (Rahul 1, Kohli 1) Kohli edges his first ball, but it goes straight to ground. \u201cGood morning and, weatherwise, we can say that with confidence,\u201d writes John Starbuck. \u201cGiven that tomorrow\u2019s forecasts are for thunderstorms, how ready are we for play on reserve-day Friday too? Got the cards ready?\u201d The forecast for Birmingham tomorrow does look very poor indeed, and it looks at the moment like play on Friday is likely. Beauty! After three successive World Cup centuries, Rohit Sharma has gone for one, pushing at the ball and feathering an edge to the keeper! 1st over: India 2-0 (Rahul 1, Sharma 1) The innings starts with a sharp single to mid-off, well run. But there\u2019s just another single to follow, and the over ends with four dots. The players are back out. 240 to get. Trent Boult has the ball in his hand, and New Zealand need some magic from him this morning. Game on. So India need 4.8 an over from 50 overs to claim a place in the final. I imagine they\u2019d have taken that 24 hours ago. 50th over: New Zealand 239-8 (Santner 9, Boult 3) A single for Santner off the first, then a bouncer beats Boult. He then bashes the next to midwicket for a couple, an ugly shot but it\u2019ll do, and follows that with a single. Santner has the strike, with two to face. The first goes to mid-on, where it\u2019s well fielded but they run a couple, and he gets nothing but pad on the last. They run a leg bye, and India\u2019s target is 240! 49th over: New Zealand 232-8 (Santner 5, Boult 0) Mitch Santner gets the day\u2019s first boundary, spearing through the covers for four. But then Henry tries to smack the last ball of the over over the long on boundary but gets nowhere near enough on it, and Kohli takes a straightforward catch! Jadeja\u2019s at it again! He takes an excellent high catch at deep midwicket, and he\u2019s essentially taken two wickets in two balls! 48th over: New Zealand 225-5 (Latham 10) Bumrah starts his day with a full toss, which Taylor only converts into a single. With so many fielders in the deep, if they manage to get bat on ball a single is inevitable, and two likely. Eight off the over, despite that run-out off the last. That\u2019s an extraordinary bit of fielding from Jadeja! The batsmen come back for a second run and it seems straightforward, but Jadeja runs in from deep square leg and hits the stumps from side-on and a distance of 40 yards! 47th over: New Zealand 217-5 (Taylor 70, Latham 6) A single for Taylor, and then a yorker that\u2019s too good for Latham. The next goes down to long leg, and the batsmen manage to run a fairly comfortable two thanks to some half-hearted fielding. Another one and a two makes six off the first five balls of the day, with Taylor on strike for the start of over 48. \u201cIf New Zealand score 30 runs from their remaining overs, it\u2019s a bad sign for them I think, because it means the pitch is good for batting and India are also likely get the required runs from their 50 overs,\u201d writes Mark van Raaij. \u201cIf, on the contrary, NZ struggle to add to their total, they might be able to also put India in trouble.\u201d So let me get this straight: the worse New Zealand do, the better New Zealand are doing? The players are out now, so either way, we\u2019re about to find out. If you get tired of the glitz and glamour of World Cup cricket, here\u2019s Tanya Aldred with the County blog: \u201cTrying to think of a less appealing challenge in world cricket than coming in cold this morning to try and hit sixes off Bhuvi and Bumrah yorkers,\u201d says Lawrence White. \u201cThere can\u2019t be much worse?\u201d It\u2019s a nasty assignment, to be sure, and there won\u2019t be many worse. Perhaps defending 230 against Sharma and Kohli? Apparently Bhuvi Kumar, who will start the day by bowling the final five deliveries of his ninth over, has been practising yorkers this morning. Even further pre-play reading: here\u2019s Andy Bull on the one great advantage Australia have over their World Cup rivals: \u201cA score of 240+ and an early wicket will mean New Zealand can book tickets to London,\u201d suggests Krish. \u201cElse the tag of eternal semi finalists can come to haunt them.\u201d I think they\u2019re a bit below par, and the fact that 12 of their last 23 balls will be bowled by Bumrah isn\u2019t encouraging, but as you say if they can score another 30 runs and take a couple of early wickets they\u2019re back in the game. Further pre-play reading: ICC says outbreak of unusually slow pitches at this World Cup is just coincidence and nothing to do with them: Important point of information: play will resume at 10.30am BST. There is, I\u2019m told, a 20% chance of rain for an hour or so at lunchtime, but that aside we\u2019re all good. We\u2019re back! There\u2019s unfinished business to be done in Manchester after yesterday\u2019s rain, which mercifully continued just long enough to prevent a potentially ludicrous 20-over Indian run chase being awkwardly squeezed into the evening. That would certainly have improved New Zealand\u2019s chances of prevailing; this outcome does the opposite. They have to click immediately and seamlessly into top gear this morning as they attempt to turn 211-5 into a defendable total in the space of only 23 balls. In particular Ross Taylor, who had finally started to score fairly freely after a slow start when the rain fell, has to go big from the off. The forecast is (fairly) good and a winner has to be found. Welcome, and here\u2019s Vic Marks on yesterday\u2019s action.",

      "body": "<p>Movies about love at first sight are common enough and so are movies that track the bittersweet season cycle of a relationship\u2019s first year. Then there are movies about a relationship further down the road, brutally tested by the agony of fertility treatment \u2013 such as Tamara Jenkins\u2019s excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/05/private-life-review-netflix-fertility-comedy-paul-giamatti\" title=\"\">Private Life</a>, from 2018 \u2013 involving older people who have had ample time to jettison any youthfully naive illusions they may have had about themselves, about each other and about life itself.

      "bodyText": "Movies about love at first sight are common enough and so are movies that track the bittersweet season cycle of a relationship\u2019s first year. Then there are movies about a relationship further down the road, brutally tested by the agony of fertility treatment \u2013 such as Tamara Jenkins\u2019s excellent Private Life, from 2018 \u2013 involving older people who have had ample time to jettison any youthfully naive illusions they may have had about themselves, about each other and about life itself.

I\u2019m just trying to make the world a better place, one day at a time.</strong> You could start by stopping saying things like that. Yes, you are definitely a LinkedIn Legend.</p> <p><strong>Awesome! </strong>It\u2019s not something to be proud of. A Twitter account called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StateOfLinkedIn\" title=\"\">@StateOfLinkedIn</a> has been collating examples of the worst behaviour on the site.</p> <p><strong>Like what? </strong>Apparently, if you want to \u201cbecome a good leader\u201d you take the first letter of \u201cme\u201d, then \u201crotate 180 degrees\u201d.</p> <p><strong>But what does that \u2026 ? Ah, I get it. Nice.</strong> But it\u2019s completely meaningless! One guy gives his job title as \u201cchange wizard\u201d. Someone else tags themselves with the line: \u201cYou call it luck, I call it 80 hours a week.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Profound.</strong> It is not profound, it is showing off. Half the time, they are posting pictures of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StateOfLinkedIn/status/1126770954351157248\" title=\"\">their expensive cars</a>, the other half, it is stories of their extraordinary compassion and generosity (that are possibly made up).</p> <p><strong>But I thought LinkedIn was just a jobs site?</strong> Yes, well, it can be useful when looking for work, but it has become more of a community over the years.

      "bodyText": "Name: LinkedIn Legends. Occupation: Imagineers. Experience: Ten years on the world\u2019s leading professional networking site. Skills: Freeing brands, cutting deals, empowering clients, having zero worries about the way that life has turned out. Is this people who have an account on LinkedIn? That\u2019s right. Microsoft bought it three years ago, as you may know. It now has more than 610 million users. And what makes some of them legendary? Constantly trying to inspire other people. What\u2019s wrong with that? When you manage a team and earn a six-figure salary like I do, people look up to you \u2013 it\u2019s your duty to inspire them. Yeah \u2026 except that is really just an excuse to announce that you are quite important at work, and that you earn a lot of money. Do you think I can\u2019t tell? Hey, jealous people will always attack you with their negativity. I\u2019m just trying to make the world a better place, one day at a time. You could start by stopping saying things like that. Yes, you are definitely a LinkedIn Legend. Awesome! It\u2019s not something to be proud of. A Twitter account called @StateOfLinkedIn has been collating examples of the worst behaviour on the site. Like what? Apparently, if you want to \u201cbecome a good leader\u201d you take the first letter of \u201cme\u201d, then \u201crotate 180 degrees\u201d. But what does that \u2026 ? Ah, I get it. Nice. But it\u2019s completely meaningless! One guy gives his job title as \u201cchange wizard\u201d. Someone else tags themselves with the line: \u201cYou call it luck, I call it 80 hours a week.\u201d Profound. It is not profound, it is showing off. Half the time, they are posting pictures of their expensive cars, the other half, it is stories of their extraordinary compassion and generosity (that are possibly made up). But I thought LinkedIn was just a jobs site? Yes, well, it can be useful when looking for work, but it has become more of a community over the years. It recently launched \u201creaction\u201d buttons to encourage people to share more on the site. What kind of community? I have not been on there for a while, to be honest. Imagine a conference of David Brents. Can\u2019t we just be pleased that they do what they love, and love what they do? Work is not supposed to be enjoyable! That\u2019s why they pay you do it. Do say: \u201cIt is sad that these people can\u2019t more openly seek the reassurance they need.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201dIt\u2019s also funny.\u201d",

On stage is Robyn Steward who, after a rousing introduction, gives a performance on her own augmented instrument: a trumpet wired through a series of pedals, producing distorted and delayed sounds I\u2019ve never heard before. But perhaps I shouldn\u2019t be surprised: Steward\u2019s trumpet is a new invention, created out of necessity in a market where barely any of the instruments available are suited to her abilities. Enabled by developments in technology, Steward is one of a small but growing new generation of women breaking down barriers of gender and ability in music. </p> <p>Steward has 10 disabilities, including autism and cerebral palsy. She plays tonight in the headline slot, in good company. Also performing is Lia Mice, PhD student and composer of avant-garde electroid pop music, tonight playing the double-headed harp guitar \u2013 like a washboard with two guitar heads at one end and 12 strings stretched across it. It follows other Mice creations such as the <a href=\"https://blog.bela.io/2018/03/08/chandelia-lia-mice-bela/\">ChandeLIA</a> (a \u201chacked chandelier\u201d), the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/242282042\">Reeltime</a> (a four-track tape looper with a custom interface), and a one-handed violin, which is operated using a throat microphone to alter the pitch of a bowed string.</p> <p>Mice was inspired to make the one-handed violin out of frustration with music lessons in schools, where whole classes are taught to play the same instrument (most commonly the violin), often excluding children with disabilities. Instruments designed with disabled musicians in mind are scarce, while those that are available are often prohibitively expensive. However, recent technological advances are enabling more and more designers to innovate in accessible music tech, at lower costs.</p> <p>One key development is Bela, an embedded computing platform created by the AIL. No bigger than a matchbox, Bela is an audio processor that turns code into sound. It\u2019s been used in the one-handed violin, the <a href=\"https://blog.bela.io/2017/12/12/fedde-ten-berge-instruments-bela/\">Sound Experiment Station</a> and the AIL\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivjHWiHN1UM\">cardboard lightsabers</a>. Both its software and hardware are open-source, meaning anyone can see how it\u2019s made to incorporate it into their own instrument designs. This approach has enabled many at the AIL to teach themselves how to design instruments, combining collaboration between members with ad-hoc design solutions (Mice bought the one-handed violin\u2019s throat mic from a website aimed at people with Parkinson\u2019s).</p> <p>When did music become important to Mice? \u201cJust always,\u201d she says simply. She\u2019s partially sighted \u2013 almost entirely blind in one eye \u2013 and doctors mistakenly forced her to wear an eyepatch over her good eye until she was 10. She only escaped the treatment after \u201ccheating\u201d an eye test, hurriedly making up a song to help her memorise the letters on the chart, then reciting them once her eye was covered up. \u201cSo yeah, music saved my life,\u201d she says, bashfully.</p> <p>AIL researcher Laurel Pardue believes the lack of visible disabled musicians in contemporary music is linked to the persistent lack of women in both the music and tech industries. The AIL is currently balanced evenly between male and female researchers, but that is unusual. A <a href=\"https://www.pwc.co.uk/who-we-are/women-in-technology/time-to-close-the-gender-gap.html\">study</a> conducted last year showed only 16% of people working in Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) are female. In music tech that figure falls to <a href=\"https://www.attackmagazine.com/features/long-read/women-fixing-gender-problem-music-tech/\">5%</a>. Even at <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/FEC192DA523E7CD4491066A1E79E4861/S1478572215000018a.pdf/music_technology_gender_and_class_digitization_educational_and_social_change_in_britain.pdf\">student level</a>, 90% of music tech students are male, while female music tech students are the most likely to drop out. \u201cWhy is it that women get turned off even just starting?\u201d Pardue asks.</p> <p>\u201cThey don\u2019t have the same physical restrictions, but it\u2019s the same question,\u201d she continues. \u201cHow do you get more women visibility at festivals, for instance, when everyone is still booking more men?\u201d Mice also notes the importance of recognising people like herself in music: \u201cI definitely have my role models, whether they\u2019re women or just inspiring people.\u201d The BBC recently revealed that <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44655719\">77%</a> of acts booked in the UK in 2018 were male. Mice herself has addressed this, telling me she has often phoned event organisers to ask why only men were booked on a particular lineup. \u201cYou\u2019re putting on a show, perpetuating this image of who a professional is in this domain,\u201d she says. \u201cSo you\u2019re contributing to the problem by running that sort of show.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24f8a903b8c9fd5f1d14cf6c101773d89b646e63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24f8a903b8c9fd5f1d14cf6c101773d89b646e63/0_83_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mary Louise McCord works with the VR-driven EXA Infinite Instrument.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary Louise McCord works with the VR-driven EXA Infinite Instrument.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Performance Without Barriers</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pardue also performed at the Iklectik the other night, playing her own augmented violin alongside live-coder Jack Armitage (better known as Lil Data).

Don\u2019t you think I might have had that thought already?\u2019\u201d she sighs. \u201cI think that could be the answer for why people drop out.\u201d</p> <p>At the Sonic Arts Research Centre, Queen\u2019s University Belfast, Franziska Schroeder and Matilde Meireles have worked on inclusive instrument design as part of the research group <a href=\"http://performancewithoutbarriers.com/\">Performance Without Barriers</a>. I ask them if there\u2019s a connection between the lack of women in music tech and accessibility in instrument design: Schroeder emphasises the need for \u201cvoices around the table\u201d, people of all ethnicities, ages and, crucially, abilities being involved in design processes.</p> <p>She and Meireles were approached by Zach Kinstner to test the EXA: The Infinite Instrument, which is operated through VR, with a pair of controllers attached to the musician\u2019s hands, functioning like drumsticks, creating sounds when hit against coloured shapes in the VR world. \u201cWe tried it out, and while a fantastic instrument for able-bodied performers, it didn\u2019t work for disabled musicians,\u201d says Schroeder. Mary Louise McCord, a musician with cerebral palsy working with accessible music charity Drake Music Project in Northern Ireland, had difficulty playing the EXA due to the high motor control required to operate it. On Schroeder and Meireles\u2019s advice, bespoke adjustments were made to the VR design, making the musical shapes easier to interact with. \u201cIt became very clear,\u201d Schroeder adds, \u201cthat we need to put inclusion at the start of the design process, rather than it being an afterthought of: \u2018How can we now change all this?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Liz Jackson, founder of disability self-advocacy organisation The Disabled List, has critiqued what\u2019s known as \u201cdesign thinking\u201d, an approach to creating more accessible products developed in the 1960s \u2013 predominantly by able-bodied white men. It relies on empathy, interviewing and observing disabled people and then tailoring an approach accordingly. But, Jackson argues, this often feels \u201cless like empathy and a little bit more like designers are gleaning our ideas and our life hacks so that they can sell them back to us as inspirational do-good without ever giving us credit.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZhiu-jGbdE\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cZhiu-jGbdE?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed&start=593\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Meireles concurs. \u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity to engage with disabled people and give them a voice, that\u2019s what collaboration should be about: sharing experiences and learning,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more people we get to know, the more we can expand these projects.\u201d</p> <p>I get the sense that collaboration and diversity \u2013 at every stage of the design process \u2013 are more important than simply promoting the surface-level visibility of women and disabled musicians in music tech. That said, anyone looking for role models could do a lot worse than Steward or Mice. A week after the Iklectik show, I go to see Mice at a warehouse party. This time she plays tracks from her new album on an Octatrack sampler, another instrument she commands masterfully. The tight crowd is transfixed and, as she tells me afterwards, no one messed with her setup. There\u2019s a long way to go, but she is one of a few reasons for optimism.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Tristram Hunt, has mounted a strong defence of the museum\u2019s relationship with the Sacklers, the family accused of making a profit from the US opioid crisis. Hunt said the London museum was proud to have received support from the family over a number of years. \u201cWe are not going to be taking names down or denying the past,\u201d he said. The Mortimer and Raymond branches of the Sackler family, prolific philanthropists to arts organisations in the US and UK, own Purdue Pharma, the maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin. Eight family members are named in a US lawsuit accusing them of helping to create \u201cthe worst drug crisis in American history\u201d. One of those is Dame Theresa Sackler, one of the most generous arts patrons in the UK and a trustee of the V&amp;A. The Sackler name adorns the \u00a32m courtyard of the gallery\u2019s Exhibition Road entrance, which opened in 2017. The Sackler family has said it will not give any more money, a decision Hunt said he respected. \u201cWe have had strong support from the Sackler family: Theresa Sackler is a trustee of the museum. I think they are reflecting on the controversy; they dispute some elements of it. They have made the decision not to give any more funds.\u201d The former Labour MP said big government cuts to arts funding meant museums and galleries had to seek out a broad range of backers but it was a \u201ctough environment\u201d. Addressing journalists at the launch of its annual review, he said: \u201cYou do your job, which is absolutely right, in criticising anyone who gives money to cultural institutions whilst wanting support for exhibitions.\u201d An estimated \u00a380m of Sackler money has been given to the arts in the UK, as well as science, health and education, and the family name appears on dozens of cultural buildings including the Sackler escalators at Tate Modern, and the Sackler Room at the National Gallery, containing John Constable\u2019s The Hay Wain and George Stubbs\u2019s Whistlejacket. Hunt said Theresa Sackler\u2019s tenure as a trustee was due to come to an end in the early autumn and he strongly defended her as a fit person to have served in the role. He told the BBC: \u201cTheresa brings a lot to the conversation in terms of her background as a primary school teacher and her focus on education. We\u2019re proud to have been supported by the Sacklers.\u201d In March Theresa Sackler announced that the Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation were suspending all new charitable giving in the UK, saying there was a danger of it being a \u201cdistraction\u201d for the bodies the foundation supported. In a statement on behalf of the Sackler Trust trustees, she said: \u201cI am deeply saddened by the addiction crisis in America and support the actions Purdue Pharma is taking to help tackle the situation, whilst still rejecting the false allegations made against the company and several members of the Sackler family.\u201d Purdue is facing lawsuits from nearly every US state over the role of OxyContin in the deadly opioid crisis. In 2007, the company was fined for marketing OxyContin \u201cwith intent to defraud or mislead\u201d regulators. Drug overdoses kill more than 72,000 people in the US each year. About 49,000 deaths are caused by opioids, including heroin and prescription painkillers such as fentanyl. In recent months, the US photographer Nan Goldin has been on the frontline of protests to campaign against links between art institutions and the Sacklers. Goldin became addicted to OxyContin after being prescribed it for tendinitis in 2014. Purdue Pharma denies any wrongdoing, as do the Sackler family members named in recent cases. The controversy was aired as the museum looked forward to 2020, announcing an exhibition programme that will include shows exploring the kimono, Renaissance watercolours, Alice in Wonderland, and the cultural history of Iran. The Iran exhibition, due to open in October, comes as tensions continue to mount between Tehran and Washington. Last month Donald Trump imposed new sanctions on Iran. Hunt said curators had been involved in close discussions with the Iranian embassy in London and was working with the National Museum of Iran on loans. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy, not in terms of cultural relations \u2026 but the landscape is not easy. Every week it becomes more challenging but in a sense that means every week it is more important to do.\u201d He said it became more valuable as an exhibition as the militaristic language was ramped up. Less tricky will be a show opening in April which promises to be the biggest exhibition ever devoted to bags. It will include more than 300 objects from the 16th century to the present day, including tiny finger purses, travelling trunks, rucksacks, Birkin bags and Louis Vuitton luggage.

And if some Democrats go down, so be it | Jill Filipovic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Acosta\u2019s plan to slash funding of a critical federal agency in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children is contained in his financial plans for the Department of Labor for fiscal year 2020. In it, he proposes decimating the resources of a section of his own department known as the <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/ilab/contacts/main.htm\">International Labor Affairs Bureau</a> (ILAB).</p> <p>The bureau\u2019s budget would fall from $68m last year to just $18.5m. The proposed reduction is so drastic that experts say it would effectively kill off many federal efforts to curb sex trafficking and put the lives of large numbers of children at risk.</p> <p>ILAB has the task of countering human trafficking, child labor and forced labor across the US and around the world. Its mission is \u201cto promote a fair global playing field for workers\u201d and it is seen as a crucial leader in efforts to crack down on the sex trafficking of minors.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepKClark?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Katherine Clark, a congresswoman from Massachusetts</a>, said Acosta\u2019s proposed cut was \u201creckless\u201d and \u201camoral\u201d. When seen alongside the sweetheart plea deal he granted Epstein in 2008, when Acosta was the US attorney in Miami, she said, it indicated that the labor secretary did not see protecting vulnerable children as a priority.</p> <p>\u201cThis is now a pattern,\u201d Clark told the Guardian. \u201cLike so many in this administration Mr Acosta chooses the powerful and wealthy over the vulnerable and victims of sexual assault and it is time that he finds another line of work.\u201d</p> <p>Clark <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/acosta-confronted-by-lawmakers-over-plea-deal-in-jeffrey-epstein-sexual-misconduct-case/2019/04/03/163b341c-565e-11e9-814f-e2f46684196e_story.html?utm_term=.ecffd431c63d\">grilled Acosta</a> about the proposed cuts in April, when he presented his departmental budget to the House appropriations subcommittee. On that occasion, she said, she found him \u201crude, dismissive, challenging\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure this is a very uncomfortable topic for him,\u201d Clark said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he should be able to hide from it.\u201d</p> <p>Acosta is facing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/alexander-acosta-jeffrey-epstein-plea-deal-resignation\">mounting pressure</a> from Democrats to resign, over the lenient deal he gave Epstein and in the wake of the billionaire\u2019s new prosecution. Epstein was arrested on Saturday and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-charges-court\">indicted</a> on two sex trafficking counts by federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York in an apparent rebuke to Acosta\u2019s earlier decision.</p> <p>Under the 2008 deal negotiated by Acosta, an FBI investigation that had produced a 53-page draft indictment involving more than 30 potential underage victims was shut down. The billionaire only had to plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting women who were controversially labeled prostitutes.</p> <p>Epstein ended up serving 13 months in a Florida jail during which he was allowed out six days a week to attend his plush business offices.</p> <p>Senior Democrats have been lining up to call for Acosta to go. On Tuesday the party leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, accused the labor secretary of having let a serial sex trafficker \u201coff easy\u201d.</p> <p>Schumer said: \u201cThis is not acceptable. We cannot have as one of the leading appointed officials in America someone who has done this.\u201d</p> <p>Others to call for Acosta to go include House speaker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1148428641849806849\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia, and former vice-president Joe Biden, now running for the presidential nomination.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Donald Trump gave his <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2019/07/09/amy-mcgrath-announces-bid-against-mitch-mcconnell-sot-ip-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/this-week-in-politics/\">first comments</a> since Epstein\u2019s arrest. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised Acosta as an \u201cexcellent secretary of labor\u201d said: \u201cThe rest of it we\u2019ll have to look at very carefully but you are talking about a long time ago.\u201d</p> <p>Trump tried to minimize Acosta\u2019s role in the 2008 plea deal, saying: \u201cI hear there were a lot of people involved in that decision not just him.\u201d</p> <p>The Department of Labor is widely respected for its vital role in investigating, prosecuting and preventing human trafficking worldwide. Experts say any major cut to ILAB would be a direct threat to the US government\u2019s ability to combat the sexual exploitation of children.</p> <p>\u201cA huge cut of this sort is bound to expose children to more risk of sexual trafficking,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.lls.edu/faculty/facultylisth-k/kimkathleen/\">Kathleen Kim</a>, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who co-authored California\u2019s law on human trafficking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/08/jeffrey-epstein-sex-trafficking-charges-court\">Jeffrey Epstein charged with federal sex trafficking crimes</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAn 80% reduction at ILAB will undoubtedly eliminate many of the US government\u2019s anti-human trafficking efforts that have been critical in encouraging action by law enforcement.\u201d</p> <p>Kim said Acosta having granted the lenient plea deal to Epstein, combined with the proposed cuts to ILAB, made it entirely inappropriate that he continued in his current role.</p> <p>\u201cHe should step down,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The battle over the future of ILAB is ongoing.

      "bodyText": "Alexander Acosta, the US labor secretary under fire for having granted Jeffrey Epstein immunity from federal prosecution in 2008, after the billionaire was investigated for having run a child sex trafficking ring, is proposing 80% funding cuts for the government agency that combats child sex trafficking. Acosta\u2019s plan to slash funding of a critical federal agency in the fight against the sexual exploitation of children is contained in his financial plans for the Department of Labor for fiscal year 2020. In it, he proposes decimating the resources of a section of his own department known as the International Labor Affairs Bureau (ILAB). The bureau\u2019s budget would fall from $68m last year to just $18.5m. The proposed reduction is so drastic that experts say it would effectively kill off many federal efforts to curb sex trafficking and put the lives of large numbers of children at risk. ILAB has the task of countering human trafficking, child labor and forced labor across the US and around the world. Its mission is \u201cto promote a fair global playing field for workers\u201d and it is seen as a crucial leader in efforts to crack down on the sex trafficking of minors. Katherine Clark, a congresswoman from Massachusetts, said Acosta\u2019s proposed cut was \u201creckless\u201d and \u201camoral\u201d. When seen alongside the sweetheart plea deal he granted Epstein in 2008, when Acosta was the US attorney in Miami, she said, it indicated that the labor secretary did not see protecting vulnerable children as a priority. \u201cThis is now a pattern,\u201d Clark told the Guardian. \u201cLike so many in this administration Mr Acosta chooses the powerful and wealthy over the vulnerable and victims of sexual assault and it is time that he finds another line of work.\u201d Clark grilled Acosta about the proposed cuts in April, when he presented his departmental budget to the House appropriations subcommittee. On that occasion, she said, she found him \u201crude, dismissive, challenging\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m sure this is a very uncomfortable topic for him,\u201d Clark said, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think he should be able to hide from it.\u201d Acosta is facing mounting pressure from Democrats to resign, over the lenient deal he gave Epstein and in the wake of the billionaire\u2019s new prosecution. Epstein was arrested on Saturday and indicted on two sex trafficking counts by federal prosecutors in the southern district of New York in an apparent rebuke to Acosta\u2019s earlier decision. Under the 2008 deal negotiated by Acosta, an FBI investigation that had produced a 53-page draft indictment involving more than 30 potential underage victims was shut down. The billionaire only had to plead guilty to lesser state charges of soliciting women who were controversially labeled prostitutes. Epstein ended up serving 13 months in a Florida jail during which he was allowed out six days a week to attend his plush business offices. Senior Democrats have been lining up to call for Acosta to go. On Tuesday the party leader in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, accused the labor secretary of having let a serial sex trafficker \u201coff easy\u201d. Schumer said: \u201cThis is not acceptable. We cannot have as one of the leading appointed officials in America someone who has done this.\u201d Others to call for Acosta to go include House speaker Nancy Pelosi, the most powerful Democrat in Congress, Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia, and former vice-president Joe Biden, now running for the presidential nomination. On Tuesday, Donald Trump gave his first comments since Epstein\u2019s arrest. Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, the president praised Acosta as an \u201cexcellent secretary of labor\u201d said: \u201cThe rest of it we\u2019ll have to look at very carefully but you are talking about a long time ago.\u201d Trump tried to minimize Acosta\u2019s role in the 2008 plea deal, saying: \u201cI hear there were a lot of people involved in that decision not just him.\u201d The Department of Labor is widely respected for its vital role in investigating, prosecuting and preventing human trafficking worldwide. Experts say any major cut to ILAB would be a direct threat to the US government\u2019s ability to combat the sexual exploitation of children. \u201cA huge cut of this sort is bound to expose children to more risk of sexual trafficking,\u201d said Kathleen Kim, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who co-authored California\u2019s law on human trafficking. \u201cAn 80% reduction at ILAB will undoubtedly eliminate many of the US government\u2019s anti-human trafficking efforts that have been critical in encouraging action by law enforcement.\u201d Kim said Acosta having granted the lenient plea deal to Epstein, combined with the proposed cuts to ILAB, made it entirely inappropriate that he continued in his current role. \u201cHe should step down,\u201d she said. The battle over the future of ILAB is ongoing. Acosta\u2019s proposed cuts were imported into Trump\u2019s $4.7tn federal budget, released in March, which contains several Republican goals including extra money for the military and funding of the president\u2019s beloved border wall. The Democrats have responded with a 2020 House budget that passed in June. It would see ILAB resources expand to $122m. \u201cCongress ultimately makes the decisions about how money is spent and appropriated,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWe will prevail and the bureau will not be shuttered if we can get this item through Congress.\u201d",

      "bodyText": "The former Tory MP Heidi Allen, who quit the fledgling party Change UK after four months, has announced that independent MPs will form another new parliamentary group, to be known as The Independents. Allen said the new group would be a cooperative and she would be coordinating a \u201cremain alliance\u201d of parties against Brexit. Allen left the Conservatives to join the Independent Group, led the successor political party Change UK, which formed for the EU elections, and then quit after a disastrous set of results. The MPs have been through a series of shakeups, both as a collective and in separate groups. At one point they registered with the Electoral Commission as the Independent Group for Change. Allen had been tipped to follow another former Change UK MP, Chuka Umunna, in joining the Liberal Democrats, but on Wednesday she said she and others who had quit the party would remain independent and focus their efforts on forming an anti-Brexit alliance of different parties. \u201cThe Independents is the new home for independent politicians in Westminster,\u201d the cooperative said in a statement, adding that it was not a political party and wanted to work across party lines. \u201cIt launches today to encourage a stronger spirit of cross-party working and its members will work collaboratively in the national interest, including to prevent a damaging no-deal Brexit which will put the jobs and futures of young people of this country at risk.\u201d Allen will launch a group called Unite to Remain, which she said would work with the Lib Dems, Greens, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the remainder of Change UK in order to ensure the anti-Brexit vote was not split. She said the grouping had been formed because of the increasing likelihood of a snap general election, should Boris Johnson attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit in the autumn. The movement, which Allen said was not a new political party, will conduct a seat-by-seat analysis and encourage the parties to step aside to support whichever has the best chance of winning. It hopes to form an alliance for between 150 and 180 seats across the country, though the Scottish National party has declined to take part. The independent grouping will also include the former Labour MPs Luciana Berger, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith, who all quit Change UK. The MP John Woodcock, who left the Labour party while under investigation for harassment, said he hoped to join the group and said he had offered to have the complaint against him investigated under its new procedures. Woodcock is a critic of Jeremy Corbyn and has said he did not believe he would be subject to a fair process by Labour. He tweeted on Wednesday: \u201cI strongly deny the charge and said when I left Labour that I was committed to finding a way to get a fair hearing for both sides that had been denied by the party\u2019s corrupted internal processes which are failing both complainants and those accused.\u201d",

Both sides engineered opportunities to claim the shield, but NSW was ultimately just in front. Not that anyone would have ventured that with two minutes to go in game three.</p> <p>I wrote earlier that NSW were comfortable in the chaos, while QLD craved control. The Blues were able to create some chaos in the second half, and ultimately profited with a long-range try to seal the game, and enter Origin folklore with it. </p> <p>Earlier, QLD had surged back into the game with two tries in 10 minutes to even the ledger. The 4 million strong audience would have collectively thought it was another QLD fairytale come to life, but Tedesco\u2019s on-the-bell try drove a stake through the mythology, giving NSW the series.</p> <p>The match had everything, and in the wash-up, it won\u2019t be cheesy to say that both sides threw absolutely everything at it. As Kevin Walters said, the first half was QLDs best forty minutes in the series \u2013 some statement after what they produced in game one. However NSW were able to capitalise on some fatigue once the referees stopped blowing penalties, allowing them to take a seemingly unassailable 12 point lead with 10 minutes left. \u2018Seemingly\u2019, the operative word.</p> <p>What do you say about Queensland - who roared back to life with 10 minutes to go when they were absolutely spent? Where do they find that belief and resilience? If you\u2019re not from there, I guess you\u2019ll never know.</p> <p>That reality made Tedesco\u2019s on-the-bell try all the more special. Make no mistake, this joins the ranks of great Origin moments. It may not jolt Mark Coyne\u2019s effort from the pantheon, but it may well go down as the most dramatic try in Blues history to date, scored by someone well on the way to greatness.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve joined us at any point through the series, a big thank you.

Queensland have undoubtedly had the upper-hand, and generally displayed great energy, intent, and attitude in defence, but the scoreboard is even. For the visitors, Munster is proving a handful for the Blues, managing to slice through tired forwards on a number of occasions. Christian Welch and Ethan Lowe have been workhorses, while Josh Papalii and Felise Kaufusi have added power and punch to the defence. Corey Norman is unfazed at this level - it\u2019s all clicking for the Maroons.</p> <p>For NSW, Mitchell Pearce has been their best - and very involved. His platform hasn\u2019t been as strong as Maloney enjoyed in game two - and the latter has been quiet so far, perhaps for that reason. Paul Vaughan has made a great impact off the bench, and while Tedesco has been marked well, he still managed to wriggle his way downfield to given NSW the impetus for their first try.

      "bodyText": "And here\u2019s Matt Cleary\u2019s match report: Final thoughts What a brilliant game; one to cap a brilliant series. This one will be spoken about for a while. Both sides engineered opportunities to claim the shield, but NSW was ultimately just in front. Not that anyone would have ventured that with two minutes to go in game three. I wrote earlier that NSW were comfortable in the chaos, while QLD craved control. The Blues were able to create some chaos in the second half, and ultimately profited with a long-range try to seal the game, and enter Origin folklore with it. Earlier, QLD had surged back into the game with two tries in 10 minutes to even the ledger. The 4 million strong audience would have collectively thought it was another QLD fairytale come to life, but Tedesco\u2019s on-the-bell try drove a stake through the mythology, giving NSW the series. The match had everything, and in the wash-up, it won\u2019t be cheesy to say that both sides threw absolutely everything at it. As Kevin Walters said, the first half was QLDs best forty minutes in the series \u2013 some statement after what they produced in game one. However NSW were able to capitalise on some fatigue once the referees stopped blowing penalties, allowing them to take a seemingly unassailable 12 point lead with 10 minutes left. \u2018Seemingly\u2019, the operative word. What do you say about Queensland - who roared back to life with 10 minutes to go when they were absolutely spent? Where do they find that belief and resilience? If you\u2019re not from there, I guess you\u2019ll never know. That reality made Tedesco\u2019s on-the-bell try all the more special. Make no mistake, this joins the ranks of great Origin moments. It may not jolt Mark Coyne\u2019s effort from the pantheon, but it may well go down as the most dramatic try in Blues history to date, scored by someone well on the way to greatness. If you\u2019ve joined us at any point through the series, a big thank you. It was a pleasure doing the MBM on this tonight. It was League\u2019s great showcase - and once the referees got out of the way, it delivered in spades. Until next time. NSW Captain Boyd Cordner does more thanking. \u201cIt was a different sort of feeling in camp, from the first game, and we got the series.\u201d QLD captain Daly Cherry Evans is then invited to the stage, thanking everyone too. \u201cWe have to remember this feeling boys,\u201d he says, \u201c...and chase it all again\u201d James Tedesco is the Wally Lewis Player of the Series Easy decision, too! Tedesco graciously thanks everyone, before departing the stage. Pearce: \u201cIt\u2019s great to be back. We had to chance our arm there. I\u2019m glad to be part of it, it\u2019s been a long time coming. My Origin career\u2019s been up and down. I feel very humbled to be trusted.\u201d Cordner: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable mate. We worked so hard. We had to win the last two. Mate, what a finish. At home, in front of our home fans, our home set. When it got to 20-all Cordner: \u201cStay composed, stay relaxed. We didn\u2019t want to go in our shell, keep our intensity. We went through some passing plays and Teddy...he\u2019s a freak. Munster: \u201cThey came out hard that second half. I thought we had \u2018em to be honest. Shows you what Origin is like. It\u2019s frustrating mate...\u201d Tedesco: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. We got a bit too comfortable. I thought it was going to golden point. To win it here in front of the crowd is unbelievable.\u201d That settles that. What a brilliant series that was. We\u2019ll have some words from players and coaches to follow. This is quite funny, they\u2019ve not taken the conversion, they\u2019ve instead started celebrating and everyone\u2019s on the field. The refs want it taken. Maloney will do the honours. And would you believe it, he kicks it from the sideline. How about that? NSW snatch victory on the bell! And it\u2019s that man Tedesco! Wow... 78 min: Some confusion - commentators say in the event of a draw, it goes to golden point. I\u2019m sure they play 10 mins of extra time regardless of points, before it goes to golden point. QLD surge downfield, Cherry Evans gets in position but bombs instead. NSW will struggle to get in position for a field goal here. But hang on! They make a break, it\u2019s Ferguson down the touchline, stays inside touch, inside to Tedesco, slips inside Mbye, and scores! Nails it! Not the easiest kick, but he drilled it through. Can you believe it? (Yes) Lowe\u2019s charge-down may well go down in folklore. DCE then slips it to Papalii with NSW disorganised, between Cordner and Maloney, and the big man goes over. HUGE KICK to come...16 m in from touch, on his wrong side for a right footer. 75 min: DCE kicks to the corner, Ferguson takes it. Five minutes to go, NSW ball. Just getting to risk stations for QLD. The Blues go 32 m and kick from halfway. Charged down by Ethan Lowe! They\u2019ve got the ball 20 out now with four tackles! Short ball from DCE to Papalii, he scores! 73 min: Easy metres for QLD, which featured a copybook tackle from Jack Wighton as Chambers tried to round him. NSW bring it out now, they spread it on the fourth, before Maloney kicks to Gain on the fifth. QLDs first tackle on their 20m line. \u201cNo NSW player out there has ever won a decider,\u201d says Gould. \u201cNo QLDer has ever lost one.\u201d Easy for Lowe. There\u2019s a try in it. 10 minutes to go. Norman somehow didn\u2019t score on the earlier play, but a huge surge from Josh McGuire sees him slide over the line - the try given after a look at a double movement. Don\u2019t look now Blues, the QLD comeback is on. Looks like a try to McGuire! 69 min: Now, a huge sequence! Maloney bombs, Munster takes over Trbojevic, who leaves a hole, and Oates is away! Cameron Murray just slows him down, before Jack Trbojevic makes the tackle. Close to the line, and DCE chips toward the posts and Frizell gives away a penalty for an escort. Here comes Queensland! 66 min: Norman bombs out on the full! They are full of mistakes now, Queensland. That was a chance to pin NSW, but poor execution allows NSW a way out. A two try advantage still doesn\u2019t seem enough for NSW - and is entirely borne of historical pain - so they keep going. Tedesco then makes a break, but NSW can\u2019t find their way over. The ball goes left, but Wighton loses it trying to feed Addo-Carr. QLD comes away again. There is still light for them, but only a slither. 64 min: NSW keep throwing punches, QLD survive. First, Pearce tries to step through. Tackled. Then Maloney. Tackled. Finally, a dropped ball from NSW and QLD are off the hook. QLD look fatigued, but there are surely twists left in this. 61 min: Cameron Murray busts through! Brilliant break. He lines up Tedesco to draw and pass, but Munster gets a hand to it! Certain try, saved! After the ensuing plays, Maloney chips for Ferguson but he doesn\u2019t see it. The ball goes touch-in-goal. But then a mistake from QLD, so NSW get another shot. QLD on the ropes here. Another simple one for Maloney. Lots of TV discussion about the fact there were 12 penalties in the first half, and 2 in the second. The new policy has certainly suited NSW, who love the flow. Incredible try from Damien Cook! 40 out, scoops it up citing tired defence, he evades the markers, gets into the back-field, swerves his way around Munster and scores next to the posts. What speed! NSW looking ominous now... 56 min: Another great set from NSW. DCE saves QLD with a great reflex take of a grubber. QLD come away and then Cameron Murray steals it one-on-one! Pearce then pops a pass that Gagai dives on, and ... does Gagai knock on? No, it\u2019s QLD\u2019s ball. NSW are comfortable in the chaos, QLD crave control. The half is becoming chaotic. 53 min: NSW follow up with an overlap on the left, it\u2019s with Addo-Carr who has some space before he\u2019s forced to kick - it\u2019s a banana back in-field, and Oates comes away with it. Later in the set, the ball comes inside to Oates inside NSWs half and Oates spills it! Pressure from Mitchell Pearce. Two mistakes from QLD now, unexpected too. Maloney from the left touchline. He nails it! Tedesco goes over! NSW made their way toward the line, before spreading left with two second-man plays. It looked to be a 3-on-2 situation, but the ball was with Tedesco who got in between Chambers and Gagai, and slid over. He\u2019s just brilliant. Maloney lining up from the sideline. 49 min: Cameron Murray is on for NSW - I wonder when we\u2019ll see Wade Graham? QLD surge forward, making metres far more easily than the Blues. DCE now kicks to Addo-Carr, and he beats a player or two after taking the ball. They\u2019re pinned here, NSW, before Maloney spreads the ball to find space. QLD then give away a penalty. NSW will now get a rare shot at the QLD line. 47 min: QLD then make 60 odd metres before kicking to Ferguson. \u201cIf the referees stay out of it, the players will decide it,\u201d says Phil Gould. Now Fittler is being interviewed, \u201cI don\u2019t know the penalty count but I can\u2019t remember the last time we got one.\u201d Incidentally, in a recent tackle Josh McGuire has accidentally knocked out Michael Morgan, who looked extremely groggy getting up. He\u2019ll go off for an HIA - would venture he will not be back tonight, especially after being knocked out last week. 45 min: So the armwrestle is on. Set for set. No whistles. Both sides kicking well, especially Maloney into Gagai\u2019s corner. QLD ruck it out but then kick their bomb out on the full - which will cost them about 30m. NSW come away with it and only make 20m before Pearce bombs to Gagai. 43 min: Huge line break from Will Chambers, he goes outside flimsy defence, through the middle, but then loses the ball after Wighton hammers him from behind. Was DCE open there? Don\u2019t think so. But of a fracas afterwards, but everyone\u2019s too tired to throw one. 41 min: Decent set from the Blues to get underway. Wighton kicks to Muster, and now it\u2019s QLDs turn. McGuire (who\u2019s been good) pops a ball to Ethan Lowe - before DCE kicks down to Ferguson\u2019s wing again. Set for set - will NSW try something here? So here we are, Queensland have shown up, Paul Vautin describes their game two performance as \u201ctoo bad to be true,\u201d and he\u2019s right. Feels like NSW will have to change something tactically to arrest the momentum of this match. Otherwise, QLD should storm home here. Billy Slater speaking to Kevin Walters: \u201cThat was our best forty minutes in the whole Origin series...\u201d Andrew Johns is in the NSW sheds, says the message is about defending Munster better, and keeping the ball in play. \u201cWhen they go set-for-set, they don\u2019t go so well.\u201d Explains the loose nature of their attack. Joey also said they\u2019ve been disappointed with the refs - they need the game to flow. Billy Slater says \u201cthere\u2019s a great mood down here, but they need to watch Tedesco.\u201d Time to take a breath. Grab a cup of tea, or a schooner, or pint, or whatever you call it, and buckle in for a fascinating second half. Origin is on the line - this is proving one of the great series. We have a potential blockbuster here. Queensland have undoubtedly had the upper-hand, and generally displayed great energy, intent, and attitude in defence, but the scoreboard is even. For the visitors, Munster is proving a handful for the Blues, managing to slice through tired forwards on a number of occasions. Christian Welch and Ethan Lowe have been workhorses, while Josh Papalii and Felise Kaufusi have added power and punch to the defence. Corey Norman is unfazed at this level - it\u2019s all clicking for the Maroons. For NSW, Mitchell Pearce has been their best - and very involved. His platform hasn\u2019t been as strong as Maloney enjoyed in game two - and the latter has been quiet so far, perhaps for that reason. Paul Vaughan has made a great impact off the bench, and while Tedesco has been marked well, he still managed to wriggle his way downfield to given NSW the impetus for their first try. Cook is growing into the game too, and we\u2019d expect Wade Graham to make an appearance shortly. Something needs to be said about the over-officiating of the game. Twitter (the great reflection of society) is in an absolute state over Gerard Sutton and Ashley Klein\u2019s fondness for the whistle, especially when so many of the calls have been so benign. Put it away, gentlemen. Let the horses run free. This game is so poised, it shapes as an absolute cliffhanger. Can the Blues arrest Queensland\u2019s momentum? There is a big scent of game one about this. If they manage to, they\u2019ll need to change something, as Queensland are owning the middle and the edges. Billy Slater interviewing DCE, leaving the field: \u201cWe showed our intentions early, we played decent football. We\u2019ve gotta stay disciplined and get the penalties out.\u201d 39 min: DCE attempts a field-goal just on half-time from 35m out. He hits it decently but it\u2019s wide. That\u2019s half-time, a few thoughts to follow. 37 min: Helter-skelter football from the Blues, who couldn\u2019t find a kicker on tackle five before Pearce loosely hoicked one in the air, leaving space. Munster then finds a tired NSW forward and busts the line, before Tedesco takes him. The Blues eventually come away, and struggle to get off their line - they look extremely tired. Pearce kicks long, and here comes QLD again. Elementary for Maloney, just adjacent to the posts. Tedesco got NSW going there, essentially from nowhere. Can they maintain the momentum? Great run from the big man, and great pass from Cook who found a rampaging Vaughan, who took three defenders with him. NSW finally find a foothold in the match. 33 min: Great run from Tedesco, he goes 50 m ducking, weaving, running through the line. He gets NSW on the front foot and they get a penalty, on tackle two (WHY). NSW take the tap, are given another penalty, tap again, and a couple of tackles later Paul Vaughan appears to crash over! We\u2019re going to the video, Ashley Klein thinks it\u2019s a try, and it is! 30 min: QLD are defending ferociously here, like the second half of game one. They are here tonight, and they\u2019re dominating. Still, NSW manage a strong set and we\u2019re battling territory now. Amazing there\u2019s been no whistle for three sets. Munster kicks to Ferguson (that\u2019s the tactic), and NSW ruck it out. An easy shot for Lowe, just to the right of the posts. QLD are on top, the referees having the biggest say. 26 min: Both sides trade solid sets, and there\u2019s a heavy hit from Addo-Carr on a falling Gagai after he takes a bomb. Then there\u2019s another penalty for laying on the ball, looked fairly benign, and that\u2019s nine penalties already tonight. Very un-Origin. As I type, there\u2019s yet another penalty for NSW being inside the 10 as QLD attack. QLD will take the two, a fairly easy shot. 22 min: Huge hit from Papalii on Tom Trbojevic, but then another penalty! Cook scoots out of dummy half 30m out, makes some metres before he\u2019s barrelled back two defenders. Vaughan then slips Tedesco through but he knocks on before attempting a pass. QLD ball 19 min: Solid set from the Blues before Pearce lands a bomb just on the QLD goal-line, which Munster takes again. NSW then ragdoll Dane Gagai back in-goal, it appears a great play before there\u2019s a penalty for a flop! Frustrating for the Blues. 16 min: Penalty QLD A great piggy-back for QLD straight after a try, and DCE kicks them into the Blues half. NSW will have to defend well here, QLD have momentum. They spread wide and Mbye nearly goes over, before Munster bombs, it\u2019s taken by Wighton, and he gets a penalty. Relief for the Blues, they\u2019ll come away from their own half now. Ethan Lowe, the goal-kicking forward, is 20m out, 15m in from touch on his favoured side for a right-footer, and drills it through the middle. QLD have started excellently. DCE takes it to the line, goes second man to Corey Norman, Norman then grubbers deftly in-goal and Felise Kaufusi storms onto it, grabs it, and the referee awards it immediately. 13 min: On the fifth, Corey Norman puts up a half bomb that isn\u2019t challenged, but Wighton, who takes it, is driven back in goal and Queensland will get another set. 10 min: Quick hands from NSW 40m out, not too much on, results in a Tom Trbojevic knock-on. Queensland will get a good look at the Blues here and they spread wide early. A thought: lots of ball movement early in the set. Lots of involvement from Pearce and Maloney. Same goes Munster and Cherry Evans. Each of them are interested in the edges. 9 min: They\u2019re targeting Munster with kicks. Another bomb from Maloney to him - he takes it well, before Frizell tries to absolutely hammer him after he\u2019s landed. It\u2019s unsuccessful. 7 min: NSW get our of their own half well, before conceding a penalty on the first tackle. DCE kicks them out of trouble. Early NSW defence is stiff - three or four players per tackle until Hunt dummies and makes some metres. Will Chambers takes the kick on tackle five - not sure that\u2019s the plan - but it\u2019s well weighted and NSW cart it out 5m from their own line. Maloney makes no mistake. A settler for the Blues. 4 min: Another penalty to the Blues, again lying on the ruck. It\u2019s 20m out, just adjacent to the posts, NSW will take the two. 3 min: Penalty NSW: lying on the ruck. NSW get first attacking crack. 2 min: Solid set from NSW, they rolled forward through Klemmer and co with decent metres. They promoted the ball too, Jake Trbojevic showed it and made 12-13 metres. Mitchell Pearce bombs and it\u2019s taken by Munster. Both sides have started well - a little enterprising too. 1 min: NSW kick-off, and Ofahengaue is hit hard by 4 Blues players. Queensland shift the ball early, and manage an offload that gains them some metres. DCE kicks early and almost grabs a 40-20, but for a bounce. Great start from Queensland. Solid anthem rendition Delivered by a member from the Chicago cast (I missed her name). Ben Hunt was holding his collar with both hands for some reason. Phil Gould is providing a short prologue now: \u201cI know we\u2019ll get a response from Queensland tonight. They\u2019ll be infinitely dangerous\u201d Preston Campbell delivers the Acknowledgement Of Country \u201cAs we gather here tonight, let us stand here with respect for the land and for each other,\u201d he finishes. NSW finally make it to the field They kept Queensland waiting a little there. It all adds to the narrative, doesn\u2019t it? Even if there\u2019s no meaning, we\u2019ll create it. Queensland face NSW now, and it\u2019s anthem time. Here they come! Lots of talk about the tunnel NSW will walk through to the ground. Fittler has opted for the Blues to warm up at their Centre of Excellence across the road, meaning a long walk into the stadium. A walk they\u2019re taking now, beneath the bowels of the stadium, Sydney Olympics style. They\u2019re passing illuminated pictures of Origin legends, and Ray Warren tells us \u2018it will take around four minutes.\u2019 Fittler walks alongside them. Meanwhile, in the QLD sheds, Johnathon Thurston merely walks around and hug/chest-bumps the team, and they enter the arena first. Gould has openly questioned the decision to take an alternate route. Does any of this matter? We\u2019ll know in retrospect. Feels kind of strange, but that\u2019s on brand for Brad Fittler. 15 minutes until kickoff: expect a nailbiter Of the past seven Origin games played at ANZ Stadium, all have been decided by four points or less. During this time, the winning team has not scored more than 18 points. Expect QLD to create an armwrestle. The Channel Nine commentary team tend to agree that NSW are stronger across the park, but if QLD can keep it close early, expect history to weigh heavily, and painfully, on the Blues. Maloney and Pearce are key for NSW tonight If you\u2019ll permit an earnest piece of analysis, the recalling of Mitch Pearce poses a curious question: who will direct the team around the field? There was something very right about James Maloney controlling proceedings in game two - he is a natural leader who enjoys shouldering responsibility for victory. In fact, at half time in game two, it\u2019s rumoured he literally said \u2018give the ball and I will kick us to victory,\u2019 before NSW went on to blitz Queensland. This time, with Mitchell Pearce called in, Maloney will be working with an experienced campaigner whose natural style is to be the general. They have worked together before - at the Roosters in 2013 - but whether or not they\u2019ll be able to gel on-field tonight will go a long way to deciding NSW\u2019s performance. Mbye\u2019s elevation is interesting In many ways, Mbye\u2019s task to mark Turbo is probably more about giving Michael Morgan some attacking freedom than anything else. The teams are in. There are late changes, because of course there are For QLD, Mbye replaces Morgan in the centres (wow) Ethan Lowe, on debut, will start For NSW, Klemmer will start, and Jake Trbojevic moves to the second row He\u2019ll start in the front-row with Daniel Saifiti, and Paul Vaughan moves to the bench.

Christian Welch 16. Tim Glasby 17. David Fifita NSW should win. That\u2019s the problem There\u2019s a statistical contradiction here tonight. NSW have won just 11 of 37 game threes. Queensland have also dominated deciders, coming out on top on 13 of 19 occasions with the Blues winning just four with another two draws. The Maroons have also won the last seven deciders in 2006, 08, 11, 12, 13, 15 and 17. That said, they have a poor record at Homebush. For a sense of how QLD manage to continually ambush NSW when it comes to the crunch, check Matt Cleary\u2019s excellent piece for The Guardian here: Good morning, afternoon or evening wherever you are, It is upon us. Origin Three. The Decider. There are few sports that so brutally make or break reputations in such unapologetic tabloid style, and that\u2019s part of what makes Origin so great. Tonight will prove pivotal for names like Pearce, Maloney, Fittler, Walters, Cherry Evans, and Bradley Charles Stubbs. We are all completely here for it. In fact, it\u2019s fair to ask: has there ever been a more Origin story arc than this, the 2019 edition? Probably. But in the pantheon of Origin series, this one is proving right up there. Leading into tonight, we\u2019ve had Keary\u2019s injury, The Coach Whisperer, refusal to publicly name the NSW team and players, Freddy (and Gus\u2019s?) game two axings, Turbo\u2019s return, Mbye\u2019s (alleged) near death. Moses is still alive, and the script has been magnificent To recap, Queensland took out game one after dominating the majority of the match at home, NSW then replied with a scorching 38-6 victory in the driving rain in Perth, and we head to Homebush tonight \u2013 in what appears to be clear weather \u2013 for the decider. All rationality points toward a NSW victory, which is why history suggests the rag tag Maroons will win. I\u2019ll be posting latest news, a few preview pieces, some stats, and various unverified thoughts before kick-off, which is officially scheduled for 8.10 (I\u2019ll guess 8.16pm AST).

      "bodyText": "Theresa May is rushing through plans for an Office for Tackling Injustices and to consult on a \u201cpolice covenant\u201d setting out standards of support for officers, as she races to secure her legacy as prime minister before Boris Johnson is expected to take office. The proposed new body would be named after a speech May gave after entering Downing Street, saying she wanted to tackle social injustices \u2013 in an apparent sign of her anxiety to be remembered for something other than her failure to achieve Brexit. A letter to cabinet ministers seen by the Guardian, signed by Penny Mordaunt, the minister for women and equalities, said the office would \u201chold government and wider society to account for achieving change against key social injustices\u201d. Its main purpose will be to collect and analyse data on social injustices, although the government acknowledges there will be \u201cpartial overlap\u201d with the Social Mobility Commission and the Equality and Human Rights Commission. The Guardian understands there was also a write-round to cabinet ministers on Monday proposing a \u201cpolice covenant\u201d that would guarantee support for the physical and mental health of officers, matching the covenant for the armed forces. The announcement could be made as soon as next week by Sajid Javid, the home secretary, who has been driving the plan and is tipped for a top job in Johnson\u2019s cabinet. The idea of a pledge to police officers that minimum standards will be honoured was proposed by Esther McVey in the Tory leadership contest and has won support among numerous Conservative MPs. The Tory leadership rivals, Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, have both been urged to carry out the plan, but it is being taken forward before May\u2019s successor can get into Downing Street. Supporters of the proposal have been urging a covenant with guaranteed inflation-proof pay rises for the police, but that element is not expected to make it into the final document. One sceptical cabinet source said: \u201cWhat about nurses, teachers and other public service professionals?\u201d The prime minister has been working on an array of eye-catching policies since she resigned, so she can point to achievements from her time in office. May is still attempting to get a \u00a327bn package of increased education spending through the Treasury, but this has been downgraded during discussions to a one-year increase of about \u00a35bn, and Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has still not signed it off. Hammond is understood to believe May should not be trying to tie the hands of her successor with a series of expensive policies while she is on her way out the door. One senior Johnson supporter said May should not be trying to push through pet projects in her final days and that the efforts were \u201cgetting embarrassing\u201d. The winner of the Conservative leadership contest to succeed Theresa May is expected to be announced on 23 July.",

Then I make a beeline straight for a certain pub.</p> <p>It\u2019s in a Black Country town called Bilston. A small flat-roofed pub, on a small high street, opposite a big Lidl. It has live music eight times a week (twice on a Sunday). Jazz. The pub is always packed to the rafters. As you order a pint of Holden\u2019s Bitter or Golden Glow, and possibly a pack of pork scratchings (at least two, in my case), your earholes will fill with two things. One, a muffled trombone that\u2019s seen too many winters. Two, laughter. Tables full of Black Country folk spending two minutes out of every five telling a story or a joke then laughing for the remaining three. The rhythm is as steady as the drummer in the corner. It never breaks. If you\u2019re not joking or laughing, you\u2019re basically not breathing.</p> <p>It has always been this way. It has been this way since my dad was dossing around Darlaston on his chopper; since my grandad was learning to lay bricks in Willenhall; since my great-grandad was cutting his teeth in a foundling home.

Before that, there was a smattering of shenanigans in the civil war, some murmurings about Catholic recusants after the reformation, and a single, prominent battle in the 10th century.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if our sense of humour arrived with the Anglo-Saxons who settled the area, but the dialect did. Essentially, it\u2019s Mercian, heavily Germanic, with vowel sounds and verb structures that resisted the influence of Norse, Norman and Middle English. Knock about Halesowen or Wednesbury for a bit, and you\u2019ll hear a bloke in a beanie hat and a zip-up coat order chips in much the same way as a flaxen-haired bearded spear-thane. If they\u2019d had potatoes back then. Or ordered what they wanted, rather than pillaging it.</p> <p>And so we have these jokes! Thousands of them, all in dialect, often featuring two flat-capped goons called Aynuk and Ayli, who get into scrapes and mishaps. There\u2019s usually dialect wordplay involved (\u201cArv bin fishin in the cut! Caught a whale day I!\u201d; \u201cWhat kinda whale?\u201d; \u201cA bicycle whale!\u201d), and the punchline is usually sardonic (Aynuk saw Ayli walking down the road pulling a piece of string. Aynuk: \u201cWot am yow doin pullin that pace o\u2019string?\u201d Ayli: \u201cWell yow troi pushin it\u201d). They\u2019re learned by heart, by ear and by word of mouth. People recognise and remember them in the same way they do hymns and prayers. They\u2019re the main form that our dialect survives in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f9b08834d1442740ab012dd093f8a1546428300\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f9b08834d1442740ab012dd093f8a1546428300/0_41_5011_3007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local girl done good \u2026 Meera Syal.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local girl done good \u2026 Meera Syal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We\u2019re big on family, and our families are usually big.

      "bodyText": "If ever, on a weekend, I get the train out of London and up through the countryside, I watch the buildings turn from stained cream to red brick. I see the reedy banks of water carrying herons and rainbow barge boats up towards locks and squat black lacquer bridges. The familiar shattered factories of Sandwell show up, followed by lorry depots, gas-canister clusters and (weirdly) a single perennial skip fire that herald the arrival to Wolverhampton station \u2013 home. Then I make a beeline straight for a certain pub. It\u2019s in a Black Country town called Bilston. A small flat-roofed pub, on a small high street, opposite a big Lidl. It has live music eight times a week (twice on a Sunday). Jazz. The pub is always packed to the rafters. As you order a pint of Holden\u2019s Bitter or Golden Glow, and possibly a pack of pork scratchings (at least two, in my case), your earholes will fill with two things. One, a muffled trombone that\u2019s seen too many winters. Two, laughter. Tables full of Black Country folk spending two minutes out of every five telling a story or a joke then laughing for the remaining three. The rhythm is as steady as the drummer in the corner. It never breaks. If you\u2019re not joking or laughing, you\u2019re basically not breathing. It has always been this way. It has been this way since my dad was dossing around Darlaston on his chopper; since my grandad was learning to lay bricks in Willenhall; since my great-grandad was cutting his teeth in a foundling home. It\u2019s an integral, unshakable, unbreakable part of our history. Which is a bit weird, because our history only really began relatively recently. The Black Country is where the Industrial Revolution kicked off in earnest. At the start of the 18th century, a small rural parcel of central England, largely dedicated to woolpacking and the occasional bit of ironmongery, exploded into life as the forge of the British empire. Ironworks, steelworks, brickworks, coal shafts, coke kilns and glass cones were jam-packed into an area of a 14-mile radius, with a network of canals \u2013 or \u201ccuts\u201d \u2013 carrying their produce, along with chains, nails, locks, traps, anchors and plenty else to the four corners of the world. Before that, there was a smattering of shenanigans in the civil war, some murmurings about Catholic recusants after the reformation, and a single, prominent battle in the 10th century. I don\u2019t know if our sense of humour arrived with the Anglo-Saxons who settled the area, but the dialect did. Essentially, it\u2019s Mercian, heavily Germanic, with vowel sounds and verb structures that resisted the influence of Norse, Norman and Middle English. Knock about Halesowen or Wednesbury for a bit, and you\u2019ll hear a bloke in a beanie hat and a zip-up coat order chips in much the same way as a flaxen-haired bearded spear-thane.

Today there are 22 built or part-built Egyptian new cities \u2013 and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) has plans for 19 more. Around 7 million people now call these new cities home.

Blink and you miss the line where lush date palms and cotton plants become desert sand.

New research has identified more than 100 examples, nearly all in Asia and Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n    <p>This week Guardian Cities meets the 90-year-olds who built the Bulgarian city of Dimitrovgrad after the second world war (many still live there) and visits the bizarre Bahria Town development promising Karachi residents protection from terror attacks and violent crime.&nbsp; We look at Hong Kong\u2019s plan to build artificial islands for 1.1 million people and examine Egypt\u2019s dream to conquer the Sahara. We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?</p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/nickmead\"><b>Nick Van Mead</b></a></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Although the masterplan \u2013 drawn up by Egyptian and Swedish engineering firms, and inspired by the modernist principles of <a href=\"https://www.doxiadis.org/\">Constantinos Doxiadis</a> and the <a href=\"https://journals.openedition.org/eps/4728\">French </a><em><a href=\"https://journals.openedition.org/eps/4728\">villes nouvelles</a></em> \u2013 depicts the city as a diamond in the desert, in reality the unfinished city appears to fade out from south to north. It is as though the desert were winning this 40-year struggle.</p> \n<p>But things here change fast. Every year the half-built new city is filled with more sand-coloured apartment blocks and villas. Huge open spaces, currently home to wandering packs of dogs, are flagged for future development. According to NUCA, 650,000 residents live here. The target is 2.1 million by 2023.</p> \n<p>Industries \u2013 plastics, paper, medical supplies and garment factories \u2013 are concentrated in a 10-mile strip along the southeastern edge of the diamond. Egyptian factory owners flocked here in the late 1970s when the government offered attractive incentives and many remain family-owned and operated. Some workers live in employer-provided houses and shared flats, or in dormitories within the factories themselves \u2013 but most low-level industrial employees are brought in daily by private buses from surrounding villages.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The first few years here were the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. No friends, nobody to rely on but ourselves</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>10th of Ramadan resident</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It\u2019s not a beautiful place. Housing is unapologetically bare, apart from the graffiti that covers many ground floor facades. Most public squares and playgrounds are dusty brown.</p> \n<p>From an ecological standpoint desert cities have obvious challenges, and 10th of Ramadan is no exception. A railway (promised for 40 years) is under construction but at the moment the city is accessible only by car, private minibus or public bus. Notorious traffic jams clog the highway to Cairo. Meanwhile, an aquifer gives 10th of Ramadan independence from the Nile, but makes the city vulnerable to pollution. A 2012 study detected chemical inorganic, biological, organic and bacteriological pollutants in all 31 groundwater samples tested.</p> \n<p>Still, the joy of public life is evident. Schoolchildren wander the streets and squares, stopping for a soda or <em>kushari</em>, a local street food. Women move in small groups, running errands collectively or gathering children from school. Residents know what cosmopolitan Cairenes think of 10th of Ramadan: that it is a blue-collar city without culture or finesse. But they tell you how much they appreciate the open space, the organisation, the quiet.</p> \n<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, men came for jobs and brought their families. Life in a city built from scratch can be alienating and lonely. As one first-generation garage owner put it: \u201cThe first few years here were the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.

      "bodyText": "Seen from space, Egypt is a vast dusty land with a green Y opening into the Mediterranean Sea \u2013 a fertile valley that makes up 5% of the country yet is home to 95% of the population. This pattern of human occupation had characterised the country for thousands of years, but in the 1970s, as ever more precious green land was eaten up by urban growth, an idea that had been taking shape in the national consciousness for decades was finally put into policy. Egypt would \u201cconquer the desert\u201d and redistribute its burgeoning population across the white sands of the Sahara \u2013 an Egyptian version of the 19th-century US \u201cmanifest destiny\u201d to move west, no matter how punishing the consequences. With Cairo bursting at the seams, plans were drawn up for satellite cities to take the strain. After many failed attempts 10th of Ramadan \u2013 a blue-collar industrial city \u2013 was the first experimental new city to take shape in the 1970s. Later new cities such as Sheikh Zayed City turned away from these working-class roots to become gated communities for the privileged \u2013 high income cities in a low-income country. For four decades the new cities programme has remained the only vehicle for Egypt\u2019s urban development. Today there are 22 built or part-built Egyptian new cities \u2013 and the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) has plans for 19 more. Around 7 million people now call these new cities home. It is arguably the most ambitious new cities programme the world has ever seen \u2013 a dream of bustling cities in an almost lunar desert landscape that outstrips the visions of even China and India. 10th of Ramadan: \u2018unapologetically bare\u2019 Named for the beginning of the Arab-Israeli war, the establishment of 10th of Ramadan to the north-east of Cairo was a populist move by an increasingly unpopular President Sadat, who sold it as a grand solution to tackle rampant unemployment, poverty and inflation with 100,000 jobs and half a million homes. Driving there from Cairo today, the cosmopolitan density of downtown soon gives way to miles of mid-rise concrete and brick apartment buildings that look solid, but are notorious for collapsing. Blink and you miss the line where lush date palms and cotton plants become desert sand. An hour after leaving Cairo, you enter 10th of Ramadan. Although the masterplan \u2013 drawn up by Egyptian and Swedish engineering firms, and inspired by the modernist principles of Constantinos Doxiadis and the French villes nouvelles \u2013 depicts the city as a diamond in the desert, in reality the unfinished city appears to fade out from south to north. It is as though the desert were winning this 40-year struggle. But things here change fast. Every year the half-built new city is filled with more sand-coloured apartment blocks and villas. Huge open spaces, currently home to wandering packs of dogs, are flagged for future development. According to NUCA, 650,000 residents live here. The target is 2.1 million by 2023. Industries \u2013 plastics, paper, medical supplies and garment factories \u2013 are concentrated in a 10-mile strip along the southeastern edge of the diamond. Egyptian factory owners flocked here in the late 1970s when the government offered attractive incentives and many remain family-owned and operated. Some workers live in employer-provided houses and shared flats, or in dormitories within the factories themselves \u2013 but most low-level industrial employees are brought in daily by private buses from surrounding villages. It\u2019s not a beautiful place. Housing is unapologetically bare, apart from the graffiti that covers many ground floor facades. Most public squares and playgrounds are dusty brown. From an ecological standpoint desert cities have obvious challenges, and 10th of Ramadan is no exception. A railway (promised for 40 years) is under construction but at the moment the city is accessible only by car, private minibus or public bus. Notorious traffic jams clog the highway to Cairo. Meanwhile, an aquifer gives 10th of Ramadan independence from the Nile, but makes the city vulnerable to pollution. A 2012 study detected chemical inorganic, biological, organic and bacteriological pollutants in all 31 groundwater samples tested. Still, the joy of public life is evident. Schoolchildren wander the streets and squares, stopping for a soda or kushari, a local street food. Women move in small groups, running errands collectively or gathering children from school. Residents know what cosmopolitan Cairenes think of 10th of Ramadan: that it is a blue-collar city without culture or finesse. But they tell you how much they appreciate the open space, the organisation, the quiet. In the 1970s and 1980s, men came for jobs and brought their families. Life in a city built from scratch can be alienating and lonely. As one first-generation garage owner put it: \u201cThe first few years here were the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. No friends, no big family, nobody to rely on but ourselves.\u201d But today \u2013 even though it remains a struggle to attract new residents \u2013 there are second and third generations living here. Even though downtown Cairo is only an hour away, for the residents of 10th of Ramadan the capital may as well be on the other side of the Sahara. In this much, at least, the experimental new city was a success. Sheikh Zayed City: \u2018no urban cacophony, no pedestrians\u2019 While 10th of Ramadan and Egypt\u2019s other first generation new cities were industrial at heart, a restructuring from the World Bank and IMF in the 1990s brought a radical shift in policy. Under president Hosni Mubarak, NUCA began selling huge tracts of land to private developers at below market value. The second generation of new cities \u2013 exemplified by the gated communities of Sheikh Zayed City \u2013 became enclaves for wealthy Cairenes eager to escape the chaos of the capital. Although Sheikh Zayed City - 25 miles to the west of Cairo and named for the emir of Abu Dhabi who helped fund it in 1994 \u2013 was originally planned as a mixed-income city, it quickly transformed as NUCA discovered the profit-making potential of land sales to developers. Sheikh Zayed City became one of the first new cities to be filled with gated compounds, popular with the wealthy seeking security, status and privilege. Luxury housing accommodates 71% of the city\u2019s residents while low-income housing accounts for just 15%.

(A friend once said it was the arthouse equivalent of Kurt Cobain singing in a subdued throaty whisper and then in a roar.) He is a technically gifted director capable of superb images and thrilling vistas, startling juxtapositions of long-shot panorama and closeup detail, mysteriously disjointed successions of dramatic scenes.</p> <p>His films sometimes seem more like installations than dramas. But I sense that, step by step, Reygadas is coming closer to autobiography, closer to being open about himself personally, but also \u2013 worryingly \u2013 balancing these quasi-revelations with evasive and exasperating contrivances and bafflements. And Our Time, for all its moments of brilliance, takes almost three hours in leading us nowhere very rewarding at all.</p> <p>On the face of it, it is very similar to his 2012 film Post Tenebras Lux (\u201cLight After Darkness\u201d), which began with scenes on a remote Mexican ranch and then enigmatically developed from there. Our Time opens in a similar way, with wonderful shots of kids playing in a magnificent landscape: they are part of a big family-and-friends party hosted by a married couple, Juan and Ester, played by the director himself and by Natalia L\u00f3pez, his frequent collaborator as editor, producer and co-writer \u2013 and indeed his real-life wife.</p> <p>The setting is a ranch (filmed on Reygadas\u2019s own ranch) where Juan breeds bulls for bull-fighting. The film doesn\u2019t belabour the metaphorical qualities of this, or not at first; neither does it waste a millisecond on debating the rights and wrongs of it. But Juan is also a prizewinning and hugely admired artistic creator in his spare time \u2013 not a film-maker, but a poet, who goes to poetry festivals as opposed to film festivals.</p> <p>With three handsome children, Juan and Ester appear to be very happy. But there is a problem. They have a relaxed attitude to monogamy, bordering on an open relationship, and when Ester has a fling with a visiting American horse-breeder called Phil (Phil Burgers), Juan is hurt but claims he would have been happy enough as long as she was honest about it. When Phil guiltily breaks off the affair to Ester\u2019s despair, Juan contacts Phil secretly and demands that he continue and let their sexual infatuation play itself out naturally. Phil is unsure whether to participate in what seems like a kinky and destructive game. This painful and strangely unsexy situation, reeking of male aggression and toxic masculinity, finds its ultimate symbolic expression in the bulls themselves.</p> <p>It is not irrelevant to wonder about the real-life story behind the film. But what is interesting about Our Time are the peripheral touches. Juan\u2019s relationship with his oldest son is moving, and there is a superb scene in which Ester goes to a timpani concerto in Mexico City. What is the need for that scene? Well, reason not the need. An alluring spectacle \u2013 but shallow and self-indulgent.</p> <p>\u2022 Our Time is released in the UK on 12 July.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JyUPIohivk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0JyUPIohivk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>",

The setting is a ranch (filmed on Reygadas\u2019s own ranch) where Juan breeds bulls for bull-fighting. The film doesn\u2019t belabour the metaphorical qualities of this, or not at first; neither does it waste a millisecond on debating the rights and wrongs of it. But Juan is also a prizewinning and hugely admired artistic creator in his spare time \u2013 not a film-maker, but a poet, who goes to poetry festivals as opposed to film festivals. With three handsome children, Juan and Ester appear to be very happy. But there is a problem. They have a relaxed attitude to monogamy, bordering on an open relationship, and when Ester has a fling with a visiting American horse-breeder called Phil (Phil Burgers), Juan is hurt but claims he would have been happy enough as long as she was honest about it. When Phil guiltily breaks off the affair to Ester\u2019s despair, Juan contacts Phil secretly and demands that he continue and let their sexual infatuation play itself out naturally. Phil is unsure whether to participate in what seems like a kinky and destructive game. This painful and strangely unsexy situation, reeking of male aggression and toxic masculinity, finds its ultimate symbolic expression in the bulls themselves. It is not irrelevant to wonder about the real-life story behind the film. But what is interesting about Our Time are the peripheral touches. Juan\u2019s relationship with his oldest son is moving, and there is a superb scene in which Ester goes to a timpani concerto in Mexico City. What is the need for that scene? Well, reason not the need. An alluring spectacle \u2013 but shallow and self-indulgent. \u2022 Our Time is released in the UK on 12 July.",

In May, he promised he would have finished writing it by summer 2020, when he travels to New Zealand for a science fiction convention. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have The Winds of Winter in hand when I arrive in New Zealand for <a href=\"http://www.worldcon.org/\">Worldcon</a>, you have here my formal written permission to imprison me in a small cabin on White Island, overlooking that lake of sulphuric acid, until I\u2019m done.

Martin said last year that the series would show Westeros as a very different place, with no King\u2019s Landing, no Iron Throne and no Targaryens. \u201cValyria has hardly begun to rise yet with its dragons and the great empire that it built,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly. On Tuesday, he revealed that the Stark family would definitely appear in the prequel, adding: \u201cObviously the White Walkers are here \u2013 or as they\u2019re called in my books, the Others \u2013 and that will be an aspect of it [along with] things like direwolves and mammoths\u201d. The show will, however, predate the Lannisters, with another family living in the home they occupy in Game of Thrones. \u201cThe Lannisters aren\u2019t there yet, but Casterly Rock is certainly there; it\u2019s like the Rock of Gibraltar,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s actually occupied by the Casterlys \u2014 whom it\u2019s still named after in the time of Game of Thrones.\u201d The novelist also revealed that the Westeros of 5,000 years ago would be split into 100 different fiefdoms. \u201cWe talk about the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros; there were Seven Kingdoms at the time of Aegon\u2019s Conquest,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you go back further, then there are nine kingdoms, and 12 kingdoms, and eventually you get back to where there are 100 kingdoms \u2013 petty kingdoms \u2013 and that\u2019s the era we\u2019re talking about here.\u201d Martin is currently writing The Winds of Winter, the long-awaited sixth novel in his series A Song of Ice and Fire. In May, he promised he would have finished writing it by summer 2020, when he travels to New Zealand for a science fiction convention. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have The Winds of Winter in hand when I arrive in New Zealand for Worldcon, you have here my formal written permission to imprison me in a small cabin on White Island, overlooking that lake of sulphuric acid, until I\u2019m done. Just so long as the acrid fumes do not screw up my old DOS word processor, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he wrote on his website.",

Five boys \u2013 three 14-year-olds and two aged 12 \u2013 were detained by police on Friday night in relation to a \u201cgrave sexual crime\u201d. An 18-year-old woman was treated in hospital after being targeted with what a police spokesperson described as \u201cextreme violence\u201d. She has since been released. On Monday, prosecutors in the Ruhr region announced that they had imprisoned one of the 14-year-old suspects pre-emptively, given the severity of the charges and two previous reports of sexual harassment. All five boys have been suspended from school until the start of the summer holidays on 15 July.

However, the number of teenagers younger than 14 held in connection with \u201ccrimes against sexual self-determination\u201d has risen over the same period, from 1,420 to 2,118.",

      "body": "<p>Over the past 50 years, the chef Alice Waters, owner and chief ideologue at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, has played a pivotal role in the popularisation of local, seasonal cooking. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/13/alice-waters-coming-to-my-senses-extract\">her 2017 memoir, Coming to My Senses</a>, Waters boiled her rationale down to its essence, almost literally. Her favourite recipe, she wrote, is: \u201cGo cut some mint from the garden, boil water, pour it over the mint. Wait. And then drink.\u201d</p> <p>Can exceptional flavours really be that simple? To find out, G2 asked a selection of top chefs for their favourite simple recipes, where a minimum of cooking transforms a few ingredients into a killer dish.</p> <h2><strong>Seasonal strawberry slushie</strong></h2> <p><strong>Bindu Patel, chef-owner, Sanctua, Leicester</strong></p> <p>\u201cAs a child, my biggest loves were strawberries and Slush Puppies. In summer, we\u2019d go fruit-picking, gather a glut of juicy strawberries and Mum would blend them with sugar and ice to create the most amazing slushies. Being Asian, you\u2019re introduced to chillies and heat early and mum would grind black pepper on top, which brings out the flavour in strawberries.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e347c7aa7f5c895bb966bc1c621ac272bff4ef05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e347c7aa7f5c895bb966bc1c621ac272bff4ef05/0_876_2388_1433/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tuna salad by Joe Wright.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuna salad by Joe Wright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Wright</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Tuna salad</strong></h2> <p><strong>Joe Wright, chef and co-owner, Porta, Chester</strong></p> <p>\u201cHot weather encourages simplicity; good produce prepared with little faff. The Spanish excel at this. I often recreate a dish I was first served on the beach in Almer\u00eda: roughly chopped tomatoes, good olive oil, fresh oregano with tinned ventresca tuna. No cooking whatsoever. The Spanish love good tinned seafood and ventresca is the prized tuna belly, line-caught, cooked in seawater, filleted and tinned by hand. It\u2019s food of the gods.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Michelin-starred Rice Krisp</strong><strong>ie cakes</strong></h2> <p><strong>Simon Hulstone, chef-owner, the Elephant, Torquay</strong></p> <p>\u201cI love to gently melt marshmallows in a bain marie to blood temperature, and mix through Rice Krispies. Set it in a tray, cut it into pieces, dip them in melted chocolate and people bloody love \u2019em. This is Michelin cooking: we only use a top-end Kellogg\u2019s and proper Flumps.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Khatta kheera</strong></h2> <p><strong>Irfan Khan, head chef, Lucknow 49, London</strong></p> <p>\u201cThis is a street snack in India, but I love it as a simple summer salad, too. Chop a cucumber into cubes, sprinkle chaat masala, cumin powder and black salt over and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. On hot days, there\u2019s no better way to cool down.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2dccae743c144194a7cfdc5398e1461c8a3b619\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2dccae743c144194a7cfdc5398e1461c8a3b619/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Labneh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Labneh.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yana Margulis Rubin/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Labneh with za\u2019atar</strong></h2> <p><strong>Stuart Ralston, chef-owner, Aizle, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn New York, I worked with an Israeli chef, Shlomo Kashy, who introduced me to labneh, basically a Middle Eastern yoghurt. You can find it in the UK now. He would spoon it into jars, top with good-quality olive oil and a warm za\u2019atar spice mix of dried marjoram, sesame and sumac, and then dip warm bread into it. It was a revelation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Burnt-butter cabbage salad</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mary-Ellen McTague, chef-owner, the Creameries, Manchester</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe nutty, caramel flavour of burnt butter \u2013 beurre noisette in French \u2013 lifts everything. You put butter in a pan, apply heat till it turns a nice golden brown, take it off the heat, let it cool and strain it. It will keep for months in the fridge. It\u2019s a brilliant dressing for fish, particularly meaty roast fish such as turbot, and it\u2019s really nice on cabbage and celeriac. With four ingredients \u2013 grilled cabbage, burnt butter, salt and lemon juice \u2013 you can produce a pretty good lunch.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Caldo verde</strong></h2> <p><strong>Elaine Mason, \u2018chief soup-bunger\u2019 and owner, Union of Genius soup bar, Edinburgh</strong></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the simplest soup I do: five ingredients, 40 minutes and brilliant at any time. It\u2019s savoury and warming in winter, nourishing and tangy in summer. Dice and fry an onion, two potatoes and four garlic cloves in olive oil, add a litre of ham stock and simmer for 30 minutes. Fry about 15cm of good cooking chorizo in a dry pan. Tip the chorizo and its oil into the stock, with a big handful of shredded kale and a teaspoon of paprika and smoked paprika. Give it 10 minutes to get itself together, grind black pepper over and enjoy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0fd52140ca45c7f9b309ca584ae209950658f7e9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fd52140ca45c7f9b309ca584ae209950658f7e9/0_0_3498_4376/799.jpg\" alt=\"Ras by Mayur Patel.\" width=\"799\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ras by Mayur Patel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Ras</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mayur Patel, head chef and co-owner, Bundobust, Leeds</strong></p> <p>\u201cGujaratis love having a sweet dish alongside savoury ones, I guess to act as a counter to spicy heat. Ras (or aamras) is pureed mango with salt and cumin seeds \u2013 gently toasted in a dry pan to release their oils, then crushed in a pestle and mortar \u2013 stirred through, to taste. I normally eat it with aubergine and bean curry, but I\u2019ve got many childhood memories of Mum making hot buttered rotis for me to dip in freshly pulped ras.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Courgette carpaccio</strong></h2> <p><strong>Stephen Harris, chef, the Sportsman, Whitstable</strong></p> <p>\u201cSimplicity is much easier in summer. I go into my polytunnel, pick a courgette, peel ribbons from it, drizzle them with good olive oil, lime, salt and a few herbs, leave it five minutes and it\u2019s stunning. Supermarket courgettes don\u2019t smell, but pick one in the garden and it smells, I think, of mint and truffles. There\u2019s so much going on there.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tomato salad</strong></h2> <p><strong>Mark Birchall, </strong><strong>Moor Hall, Aughton, Lancashire</strong></p> <p>\u201cIn summer, I get terrific tomatoes from a grower near Southport. I blanch, peel and chop them, dress them with olive oil, lemon zest, salt and pickled shallots and add St James ewe\u2019s milk cheese. It\u2019s a great family supper, especially with barbecued mackerel.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>DIY pane, burro e alici</strong></h2> <p><strong>Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner, Trullo, London</strong></p> <p>\u201cQuality salted anchovies, salted butter and crunchy bread served in three piles on the table \u2013 assemble and eat. I came across this at London\u2019s Terroir and thought it was French until I visited Rome, where it is everywhere. It always makes life happier.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Roast sardines and beans</strong></h2> <p><strong>Rebecca Seal, co-author, Leon: Happy One-Pot Cooking</strong></p> <p>\u201cPartly due to having small children, I need to cook with as little prep as possible. I\u2019m obsessed with things you can put on a tray, bung in the oven and produce a meal from. For this, you halve loads of cherry tomatoes (it\u2019s a summer dish; I wouldn\u2019t risk out-of-season tomatoes), chuck them on a baking tray with tinned white beans, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper for 15 minutes at 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4. Then season and place whole sardines \u2013 or fillets if you\u2019re funny about bones \u2013 on top of the ingredients for another eight minutes. Remove from oven. Eat, from the pan if necessary.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad337392d9c8ed9e47cb8b48446d011a4e7cb60c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad337392d9c8ed9e47cb8b48446d011a4e7cb60c/0_419_1112_667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blackberry apple jam by Sharon Hearne-Smith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blackberry apple jam by Sharon Hearne-Smith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Blackberry apple jam</strong></h2> <p><strong>Sharon Hearne-Smith, author of The No-Cook Cookbook</strong></p> <p>\u201cCrush the berries with a fork, stir in grated apple, honey and cinnamon to taste. Add chia seeds, which magically thicken it into a beautiful jam \u2013 one healthier than bought. I\u2019m a mum to two small children and we love this jam with yoghurt and granola.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Tomato and ham skewers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Isaac McHale, chef, the Clove Club, London</strong></p> <p>\u201cTake 10 ultra-thin slices of smoked pancetta and 10 vine-ripened cherry tomatoes. Wrap each tomato in slice of pancetta, like a belt.

      "bodyText": "Over the past 50 years, the chef Alice Waters, owner and chief ideologue at Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California, has played a pivotal role in the popularisation of local, seasonal cooking. In her 2017 memoir, Coming to My Senses, Waters boiled her rationale down to its essence, almost literally. Her favourite recipe, she wrote, is: \u201cGo cut some mint from the garden, boil water, pour it over the mint. Wait. And then drink.\u201d Can exceptional flavours really be that simple? To find out, G2 asked a selection of top chefs for their favourite simple recipes, where a minimum of cooking transforms a few ingredients into a killer dish. Seasonal strawberry slushie Bindu Patel, chef-owner, Sanctua, Leicester \u201cAs a child, my biggest loves were strawberries and Slush Puppies. In summer, we\u2019d go fruit-picking, gather a glut of juicy strawberries and Mum would blend them with sugar and ice to create the most amazing slushies. Being Asian, you\u2019re introduced to chillies and heat early and mum would grind black pepper on top, which brings out the flavour in strawberries.\u201d Tuna salad Joe Wright, chef and co-owner, Porta, Chester \u201cHot weather encourages simplicity; good produce prepared with little faff. The Spanish excel at this. I often recreate a dish I was first served on the beach in Almer\u00eda: roughly chopped tomatoes, good olive oil, fresh oregano with tinned ventresca tuna. No cooking whatsoever. The Spanish love good tinned seafood and ventresca is the prized tuna belly, line-caught, cooked in seawater, filleted and tinned by hand. It\u2019s food of the gods.\u201d Michelin-starred Rice Krispie cakes Simon Hulstone, chef-owner, the Elephant, Torquay \u201cI love to gently melt marshmallows in a bain marie to blood temperature, and mix through Rice Krispies. Set it in a tray, cut it into pieces, dip them in melted chocolate and people bloody love \u2019em. This is Michelin cooking: we only use a top-end Kellogg\u2019s and proper Flumps.\u201d Khatta kheera Irfan Khan, head chef, Lucknow 49, London \u201cThis is a street snack in India, but I love it as a simple summer salad, too. Chop a cucumber into cubes, sprinkle chaat masala, cumin powder and black salt over and finish with a squeeze of lime juice. On hot days, there\u2019s no better way to cool down.\u201d Labneh with za\u2019atar Stuart Ralston, chef-owner, Aizle, Edinburgh \u201cIn New York, I worked with an Israeli chef, Shlomo Kashy, who introduced me to labneh, basically a Middle Eastern yoghurt. You can find it in the UK now. He would spoon it into jars, top with good-quality olive oil and a warm za\u2019atar spice mix of dried marjoram, sesame and sumac, and then dip warm bread into it. It was a revelation.\u201d Burnt-butter cabbage salad Mary-Ellen McTague, chef-owner, the Creameries, Manchester \u201cThe nutty, caramel flavour of burnt butter \u2013 beurre noisette in French \u2013 lifts everything. You put butter in a pan, apply heat till it turns a nice golden brown, take it off the heat, let it cool and strain it. It will keep for months in the fridge. It\u2019s a brilliant dressing for fish, particularly meaty roast fish such as turbot, and it\u2019s really nice on cabbage and celeriac. With four ingredients \u2013 grilled cabbage, burnt butter, salt and lemon juice \u2013 you can produce a pretty good lunch.\u201d Caldo verde Elaine Mason, \u2018chief soup-bunger\u2019 and owner, Union of Genius soup bar, Edinburgh \u201cIt\u2019s the simplest soup I do: five ingredients, 40 minutes and brilliant at any time. It\u2019s savoury and warming in winter, nourishing and tangy in summer. Dice and fry an onion, two potatoes and four garlic cloves in olive oil, add a litre of ham stock and simmer for 30 minutes. Fry about 15cm of good cooking chorizo in a dry pan. Tip the chorizo and its oil into the stock, with a big handful of shredded kale and a teaspoon of paprika and smoked paprika. Give it 10 minutes to get itself together, grind black pepper over and enjoy.\u201d Ras Mayur Patel, head chef and co-owner, Bundobust, Leeds \u201cGujaratis love having a sweet dish alongside savoury ones, I guess to act as a counter to spicy heat. Ras (or aamras) is pureed mango with salt and cumin seeds \u2013 gently toasted in a dry pan to release their oils, then crushed in a pestle and mortar \u2013 stirred through, to taste. I normally eat it with aubergine and bean curry, but I\u2019ve got many childhood memories of Mum making hot buttered rotis for me to dip in freshly pulped ras.\u201d Courgette carpaccio Stephen Harris, chef, the Sportsman, Whitstable \u201cSimplicity is much easier in summer. I go into my polytunnel, pick a courgette, peel ribbons from it, drizzle them with good olive oil, lime, salt and a few herbs, leave it five minutes and it\u2019s stunning. Supermarket courgettes don\u2019t smell, but pick one in the garden and it smells, I think, of mint and truffles. There\u2019s so much going on there.\u201d Tomato salad Mark Birchall, Moor Hall, Aughton, Lancashire \u201cIn summer, I get terrific tomatoes from a grower near Southport. I blanch, peel and chop them, dress them with olive oil, lemon zest, salt and pickled shallots and add St James ewe\u2019s milk cheese. It\u2019s a great family supper, especially with barbecued mackerel.\u201d DIY pane, burro e alici Tim Siadatan, chef and co-owner, Trullo, London \u201cQuality salted anchovies, salted butter and crunchy bread served in three piles on the table \u2013 assemble and eat. I came across this at London\u2019s Terroir and thought it was French until I visited Rome, where it is everywhere. It always makes life happier.\u201d Roast sardines and beans Rebecca Seal, co-author, Leon: Happy One-Pot Cooking \u201cPartly due to having small children, I need to cook with as little prep as possible. I\u2019m obsessed with things you can put on a tray, bung in the oven and produce a meal from. For this, you halve loads of cherry tomatoes (it\u2019s a summer dish; I wouldn\u2019t risk out-of-season tomatoes), chuck them on a baking tray with tinned white beans, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, salt and pepper for 15 minutes at 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4. Then season and place whole sardines \u2013 or fillets if you\u2019re funny about bones \u2013 on top of the ingredients for another eight minutes. Remove from oven. Eat, from the pan if necessary.\u201d Blackberry apple jam Sharon Hearne-Smith, author of The No-Cook Cookbook \u201cCrush the berries with a fork, stir in grated apple, honey and cinnamon to taste. Add chia seeds, which magically thicken it into a beautiful jam \u2013 one healthier than bought. I\u2019m a mum to two small children and we love this jam with yoghurt and granola.\u201d Tomato and ham skewers Isaac McHale, chef, the Clove Club, London \u201cTake 10 ultra-thin slices of smoked pancetta and 10 vine-ripened cherry tomatoes. Wrap each tomato in slice of pancetta, like a belt. Skewer the tomatoes in sets of five \u2013 carefully put two skewers in each set, so you can turn them \u2013 and grill until they\u2019re warm and bursting and the pancetta is melting. Eat slowly and smile. Smoked mackerel pate Sally Ab\u00e9, head-chef, the Harwood Arms, London \u201cYou\u2019re stirring a few ingredients together \u2013 two smoked mackerel fillets, a tablespoon of creme fraiche, lemon juice, salt and horseradish \u2013 to create a thing of beauty. Don\u2019t overmix it, you want lovely pieces of fish in there, add the creme fraiche slowly to get the consistency right and it needs a good amount of lemon juice to cut the mackerel\u2019s fattiness.\u201d Pistachio, rose and cardamom marzipan Sarit Packer, chef and co-owner, Honey &amp; Co, London \u201cPistachios and rose water give our marzipan a Middle Eastern twist. Mix ground pistachios, icing sugar, lemon juice, a little lemon zest, a drop of rose water and ground cardamom together until it is a smooth paste; working by hand helps extract the oil from the nuts. Tear off bite-size pieces and roll them into balls. It\u2019s a delicious sweet treat after dinner, served with strong coffee or fresh mint tea.\u201d Super summer cabbage sauerkraut Douglas McMaster, chef-owner, Silo, Brighton \u201cTake a handsome pointed cabbage, shred it, massage it with coarse salt until it softens and starts weeping.

      "body": "<p>Lydia Lunch turned 60 this year, but age has done little to dim this counterculture icon\u2019s lust for life. Decades after her start as the nihilist 16-year-old frontwoman of 1970s no-wave band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, the New York-born \u201capocalyptician\u201d is a revered veteran of the US underground: a writer, spoken-word performer, musician, actor and artist. Lunch\u2019s style is raw and incendiary, all sex and death and taboo-busting feminist rage. And in 2019, the sexagenarian is as unapologetic and active as ever \u2013 still writing, touring, collaborating and performing.</p> <p>Lunch is in Colchester when we speak, luxuriating in a \u201cfabulous cottage-type hotel\u201d conveniently situated near the cultural centre where she\u2019s set to play that night with her band, Big Sexy Noise. On the stage and the page, she\u2019s a formidable presence \u2013 seducing, goading and tongue-lashing her audience. In conversation, via Skype, she\u2019s surprisingly jovial: affable, accommodating, disarmingly witty, a potty-mouthed doyenne dealing out double-entendres. Is she misunderstood? \u201cOh, chronically! But I get off on it. I\u2019m not a miserable person, I just deal in miserable subjects.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/lydia-lunch-no-wave-music-writing-workshop\">The last time the Guardian spoke with Lunch</a>, in 2015, she was scouting around for a home for her archive, an honour that\u2019s since gone to New York University. \u201cThey\u2019re opening a new exhibition space next year and I think they\u2019re gonna launch it with my archives, which is great.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting location: although she left for good in 1990, and doesn\u2019t consider it home (\u201ceven when I lived there\u201d), New York informed much of who Lunch became, and the art she\u2019s made since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"884815179ea525978948db5104fe9096819e43bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/884815179ea525978948db5104fe9096819e43bb/0_0_2662_4000/666.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d live this long\u2019 \u2026 Lunch performing in Barcelona in 2011.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d live this long\u2019 \u2026 Lunch performing in Barcelona in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jordi Vidal/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lunch\u2019s work is defiant, thrilling and <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/7115585?fbclid=IwAR29gAjzcDiXlDYyKxYmCFCd2j9Uphm3QZe6e3RcmjcdkO3wkg1Z-pf1m28\">unflinching</a>. Her latest release, So Real It Hurts, is just so: an anthology of new and established writings that include everything from violent feminist revenge fantasies to diatribes on pollution and politics (and yes, Trump) in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">Anthropocene </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/30/anthropocene-epoch-have-we-entered-a-new-phase-of-planetary-history\">epoch</a>. They detail deviant delights, heroes sung (Hubert Selby Jr) and unsung (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Huncke\">Herbert Huncke</a>) alike. They offer alternative historical testimony documented in killer style: pre-gentrification New York, (the \u201cdevil\u2019s litterbox\u201d); the no-wave scene (\u201ca collective bowel-cleansing caterwaul \u2026 a mad collective of death-defiant miscreants\u201d); and the start of the race riots of 1967, witnessed first-hand by an eight-year-old Lydia when her hometown \u2013 which became the centre of the chaos \u2013 erupted into violence, with a baseball-bat carrying hoard \u201cstampeding directly in front of my house\u201d.</p> <p>The anthology, she tells me, \u201cwas rejected by 26 American publishers \u2013 and I\u2019m quite happy to say that. I wanted that stamped on the front cover, actually.\u201d She eventually found a publisher, Seven Stories, that appreciates her calling as a \u201cstubborn, independent town-crier\u201d. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Why do you want to publish this book?\u2019 And one of them said, \u2018Because I laughed at every chapter.\u2019 Finally! Someone gets it. Yes! I mean, this [life] shit is deadly serious, so lets have a party and celebrate the fact that we\u2019re still alive in spite of this nightmare. That\u2019s what my whole career has been about.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>Let's have a party and celebrate the fact we're still alive in spite of this nightmare</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Opening the anthology is an introduction by the late celebrity chef and travel writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/09/anthony-bourdain-obituary\">Anthony Bourdain</a>. Were they friends? \u201cWe knew of each other. He\u2019d read something I\u2019d written for a photobook of [Bourdain\u2019s partner] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/asia-argento\">Asia Argento</a>. And we\u2019d met when he did his <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/lydia-lunch-anthony-bourdain-lower-east-side-new-york/index.html\">Lower East Side</a> special. One of the questions I asked him was, \u2018How did you do it?\u2019 How did he go from being a heroin addict scumbag cook to [a sober and successful celebrity]? He said, \u2018It was a total fluke.\u2019 I just think that\u2019s great. Because some people are born ambitious and they plan for success; other people just do what they do, and wherever it goes is where they get.\u201d</p> <p>Like Bourdain, Lunch found community through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food\">food</a> as a young runaway. As legend tells it, the young hellion earned her nom de plume after gaining renown as both an expert food thief and an on-the-fly chef, transforming produce she\u2019d filched into nourishing lunches for fellow punks such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Boys\">Dead Boys</a>. In 2012 she released a cookbook, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lydia-Lunch-Need-Feed-Developing/dp/0789324385\">The Need </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lydia-Lunch-Need-Feed-Developing/dp/0789324385\">to Feed</a>, telling <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6a7556/we-talked-to-lydia-lunch-and-she-didnt-seem-to-like-us-very-much\">Vice</a>: \u201cCooking is one of the most intimate things this side of sex \u2013 cooking leads to good sex.

It\u2019s a form of impregnation \u2013 which is basically what my entire artistic motive is, anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Does she still enjoy cooking? \u201cI do. It\u2019s very witchy. But you\u2019ve gotta be careful about where your food comes from \u2013 especially in the UK and the States \u2013 because we end up consuming so much poison.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d04362916fe00e8dc89ba59991f488c4c3802f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/26d04362916fe00e8dc89ba59991f488c4c3802f/0_0_3424_2461/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I think we comprehended more than we knew\u2019 \u2026 Lunch rocks Los Angeles in 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"719\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think we comprehended more than we knew\u2019 \u2026 Lunch rocks Los Angeles in 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ray Stevenson/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lunch knows a thing or two about toxins.

At last count, says Lunch, there are 39,000 hazardous sites spread across America. So Real It Hurts points the finger at big conglomerates and the US Department of Justice. But this isn\u2019t a new theme for Lunch; she\u2019s been speaking out about environmental justice since her early20s.</p> <p>\u201cI think those of us doing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/spoken-word\">spoken word</a> when I got started, under Reagan and Thatcher \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/oct/28/john-cooper-clarke-my-trousers-river-island-or-ms-the-skinniest-they-do\">John Cooper Clarke</a>, Exene Cervenka, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/06/henry-rollins-trump-fans-are-going-to-be-very-dangerous-losers\">Henry Rollins</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/25/jello-biafra-obama-occupy\">Jello Biafr</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/25/jello-biafra-obama-occupy\">a </a>\u2013 I think we comprehended more than we knew.

There were 379 tornados in 13 days in America last month. In India? Drought. China? Flooding. I was in Mexico City a month ago; they have the worst air pollution in decades.

      "bodyText": "Lydia Lunch turned 60 this year, but age has done little to dim this counterculture icon\u2019s lust for life. Decades after her start as the nihilist 16-year-old frontwoman of 1970s no-wave band Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, the New York-born \u201capocalyptician\u201d is a revered veteran of the US underground: a writer, spoken-word performer, musician, actor and artist. Lunch\u2019s style is raw and incendiary, all sex and death and taboo-busting feminist rage. And in 2019, the sexagenarian is as unapologetic and active as ever \u2013 still writing, touring, collaborating and performing. Lunch is in Colchester when we speak, luxuriating in a \u201cfabulous cottage-type hotel\u201d conveniently situated near the cultural centre where she\u2019s set to play that night with her band, Big Sexy Noise. On the stage and the page, she\u2019s a formidable presence \u2013 seducing, goading and tongue-lashing her audience. In conversation, via Skype, she\u2019s surprisingly jovial: affable, accommodating, disarmingly witty, a potty-mouthed doyenne dealing out double-entendres. Is she misunderstood? \u201cOh, chronically! But I get off on it. I\u2019m not a miserable person, I just deal in miserable subjects.\u201d The last time the Guardian spoke with Lunch, in 2015, she was scouting around for a home for her archive, an honour that\u2019s since gone to New York University. \u201cThey\u2019re opening a new exhibition space next year and I think they\u2019re gonna launch it with my archives, which is great.\u201d It\u2019s a fitting location: although she left for good in 1990, and doesn\u2019t consider it home (\u201ceven when I lived there\u201d), New York informed much of who Lunch became, and the art she\u2019s made since. Lunch\u2019s work is defiant, thrilling and unflinching. Her latest release, So Real It Hurts, is just so: an anthology of new and established writings that include everything from violent feminist revenge fantasies to diatribes on pollution and politics (and yes, Trump) in the Anthropocene epoch. They detail deviant delights, heroes sung (Hubert Selby Jr) and unsung (Herbert Huncke) alike. They offer alternative historical testimony documented in killer style: pre-gentrification New York, (the \u201cdevil\u2019s litterbox\u201d); the no-wave scene (\u201ca collective bowel-cleansing caterwaul \u2026 a mad collective of death-defiant miscreants\u201d); and the start of the race riots of 1967, witnessed first-hand by an eight-year-old Lydia when her hometown \u2013 which became the centre of the chaos \u2013 erupted into violence, with a baseball-bat carrying hoard \u201cstampeding directly in front of my house\u201d. The anthology, she tells me, \u201cwas rejected by 26 American publishers \u2013 and I\u2019m quite happy to say that. I wanted that stamped on the front cover, actually.\u201d She eventually found a publisher, Seven Stories, that appreciates her calling as a \u201cstubborn, independent town-crier\u201d. \u201cI asked them, \u2018Why do you want to publish this book?\u2019 And one of them said, \u2018Because I laughed at every chapter.\u2019 Finally! Someone gets it. Yes! I mean, this [life] shit is deadly serious, so lets have a party and celebrate the fact that we\u2019re still alive in spite of this nightmare. That\u2019s what my whole career has been about.\u201d Opening the anthology is an introduction by the late celebrity chef and travel writer Anthony Bourdain. Were they friends? \u201cWe knew of each other. He\u2019d read something I\u2019d written for a photobook of [Bourdain\u2019s partner] Asia Argento. And we\u2019d met when he did his Lower East Side special. One of the questions I asked him was, \u2018How did you do it?\u2019 How did he go from being a heroin addict scumbag cook to [a sober and successful celebrity]? He said, \u2018It was a total fluke.\u2019 I just think that\u2019s great. Because some people are born ambitious and they plan for success; other people just do what they do, and wherever it goes is where they get.\u201d Like Bourdain, Lunch found community through food as a young runaway. As legend tells it, the young hellion earned her nom de plume after gaining renown as both an expert food thief and an on-the-fly chef, transforming produce she\u2019d filched into nourishing lunches for fellow punks such as Dead Boys. In 2012 she released a cookbook, The Need to Feed, telling Vice: \u201cCooking is one of the most intimate things this side of sex \u2013 cooking leads to good sex. You are touching something that someone else is digesting. Your DNA is on the food they eat. It\u2019s a form of impregnation \u2013 which is basically what my entire artistic motive is, anyway.\u201d Does she still enjoy cooking? \u201cI do. It\u2019s very witchy. But you\u2019ve gotta be careful about where your food comes from \u2013 especially in the UK and the States \u2013 because we end up consuming so much poison.\u201d Lunch knows a thing or two about toxins. Before she was old enough to pick her own poisons, Lunch grew up on one of America\u2019s Superfund sites: land contaminated by life-endangering hazardous waste. At last count, says Lunch, there are 39,000 hazardous sites spread across America. So Real It Hurts points the finger at big conglomerates and the US Department of Justice. But this isn\u2019t a new theme for Lunch; she\u2019s been speaking out about environmental justice since her early20s. \u201cI think those of us doing spoken word when I got started, under Reagan and Thatcher \u2013 John Cooper Clarke, Exene Cervenka, Henry Rollins, Jello Biafra \u2013 I think we comprehended more than we knew. I go back to some of the speeches I wrote in 84, and I\u2019m like, yup, I could do that one tonight.\u201d She\u2019s cheered by today\u2019s climate activists, citing Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion (\u201cbig fan\u201d), but is also incredulous at current political inaction. \u201cI mean it\u2019s just ridiculous that we\u2019re still having this conversation. There were 379 tornados in 13 days in America last month. In India? Drought. China? Flooding. I was in Mexico City a month ago; they have the worst air pollution in decades. You can\u2019t get away from it. There\u2019ll be more plastic in the ocean than fish soon. I mean, wake the fuck up.\u201d I tell her that a recent investigation has revealed that British people are ingesting a credit-card-sized amount of plastic every week thanks to microplastics in our air, food and water supplies. \u201cIf only we could shit those credit cards out and use \u2019em at the ATM, eh?\u201d Lunch\u2019s sense of humour is dark, delightful and revelatory.

However, the ICO is exploring options, including ringfencing part of the fine income to cover potential litigation costs to defend its decisions. How much tougher are the fines under the new GDPR legislation? A lot tougher. Last year Facebook was fined \u00a3500,000 by the ICO over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which involved the data of up to 87 million users improperly being shared with third-party developers without sufficient consent. At the time the ICO lamented the fact that this was the maximum fine it was allowed to impose under the old legislation. Given Facebook\u2019s worldwide revenue was $40.7bn (\u00a331.5bn) in 2017, the ICO pointed out it could have handed down a fine of up to \u00a31.26bn (4% of revenue) had the case had been eligible under GDPR. The ICO has in the past been viewed as understaffed and underpowered. Has this changed? It certainly has. The ICO\u2019s role has become critical in the digital age. Its annual report, published this week, said last year was record-breaking for issuing monetary penalties, although these only totalled \u00a33m in the 12 months to the end of March. Average staff numbers have increased by a third \u2013 from 480 to 638 year-on-year \u2013 in line with its increased GDPR powers. It has 722 permanent staff. This pushed the ICO\u2019s annual running costs up by 58%, from \u00a327m to \u00a343m. Data protection complaints have almost doubled year-on-year from 21,019 to 41,661. The pay of the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has risen by a quarter year-on-year from about \u00a3195,000 to about \u00a3245,000.",

The beauty of cannelloni, however, is that they\u2019re incredible easy to make, and bake, hence their popularity on restaurant menus. But what\u2019s the best way to go about it?</p> <h2>The pasta</h2> <p>First things first: the structure of the dish. Cannelloni is one of those relatively rare Italian pasta dishes where the ratio of pasta to filling is skewed in favour of the latter, but that\u2019s not to say you can afford to slack. The best versions I try are, naturally, made with homemade egg pasta, and this is an occasion where including a proportion of semolina flour is a very good idea: with such a soft, mild filling, the pasta needs to retain a bit of bite. To this end, I\u2019d suggest par-boiling it for a minute, as Roddy\u2019s favourite recipe, from <a href=\"https://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=22532981118\" title=\"\">Pasta: Sapori d\u2019Italia</a>, recommends, rather than any longer: the three minutes in <a href=\"https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/116392/the-italian-cookery-course-techniques/3?sort=main_title+desc\" title=\"\">Katie Caldesi\u2019s The Italian Cookery Course</a> proves a bit soft for most tastes once it is baked.</p> <p>Strangely enough, the dried tubes of cannelloni I remember from childhood seem to have disappeared from my local supermarket, though they are still available in larger stores. I do have a go with sheets of fresh egg lasagne, however, and can confirm that, if you\u2019re short of time, these also work a treat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c26cfda65f07e35479b76201fbf0b9e3a681e24c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c26cfda65f07e35479b76201fbf0b9e3a681e24c/814_0_3218_2397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s Perfect spinach ricotta cannelloni Felicity Cloake pics Christopher Boswell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"745\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Boswell\u2019s effort uses any greens he has to hand, and adds grana padano to the filling too. Thumbnails by Felicity Cloake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The greens</h2> <p>Spinach is the preferred choice, obviously \u2013 I\u2019d advise searching out bunches of mature stuff, rather than tiny baby spinach leaves sold in supermarkets, which, in my experience, collapse to mush once wilted and baked. If you can\u2019t find them (greengrocers, markets and farm shops are a good source), the next best thing, as Caldesi says, is to buy it frozen, but make sure you get the whole leaf stuff, not the strangely popular pucks of green puree, then defrost and squeeze well before use \u2013 any excess liquid will make your filling watery.</p> <p>Christopher Boswell writes in <a href=\"https://www.eatyourbooks.com/library/recipes/1453109/cannelloni-with-sheeps-milk-ricotta\" title=\"\">Pasta: Recipes from the Kitchen of the American Academy in Rome</a> that in his kitchen they make these cannelloni with \u201cany greens we have handy. Chard, nettles, turnip tops, cavolo nero and kale all work well.\u201d I try one recipe with cavolo nero, and it proves very popular; indeed, the stronger flavour is actually preferred by some of my testers. If you do use more robustly textured greens, cook them in salted water until tender, dunk in cold water, then drain very well before finely chopping.</p> <p>Others add garlic or other aromatics to \u201cbump up the flavour\u201d, as Caldesi puts it \u2013 she deploys \u201csoft leaf herbs, such as basil, chives, parsley and oregano\u201d. We all love her cannelloni, but they do taste more of herbs than spinach or ricotta, so if you\u2019re keen for these rather shy and retiring ingredients to remain the stars of the show, I\u2019d recommend sauteeing the spinach in butter with just a little crushed garlic, <a href=\"https://www.cucchiaio.it/ricetta/cannelloni-ricotta-e-spinaci/#recipe_slider_procedure_2\" title=\"\">as the Silver Spoon suggests</a>, to enhance, rather than obscure them.</p> <p>A good sprinkling of salt and a generous grating of nutmeg, which works so well with both ricotta and spinach, are completely non-negotiable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"7ba91cd00e6993fa7f8d57d232a42913b5073256\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7ba91cd00e6993fa7f8d57d232a42913b5073256/0_0_4032_3021/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s Perfect spinach ricotta cannelloni Felicity Cloake pics Pasta Sapori d\u2019Italia\" width=\"1000\" height=\"749\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Finish under the grill, as Pasta Sapori d\u2019Italia\u2019s version does.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The dairy</h2> <p>Ricotta is, of course, the order of the day; I love it in all its forms, but with such a plain dish, it\u2019s worth buying some really good fresh stuff for this. Many recipes add grated hard cheese to the filling, too \u2013 usually grated parmesan, or grana padano in Boswell\u2019s recipe. Bear in mind that if you want to make this dish strictly vegetarian, you\u2019ll need to source a vegetarian alternative; they\u2019re widely available these days.</p> <p>Some recipes, though not all, add eggs to the filling as well \u2013 or just yolks in the case of Caz Hildebrand and Jacob Kenedy\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.geometryofpasta.com/\" title=\"\">The Geometry of Pasta</a> \u2013 but I can\u2019t see the point; those without are just as good, and I think have a slightly softer, creamier texture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"32f16583cbdbe105221e6a4d61bf24041a041aff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32f16583cbdbe105221e6a4d61bf24041a041aff/0_461_3024_3571/847.jpg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake\u2019s Perfect spinach ricotta cannelloni Felicity Cloake pics Jacob Kenedy and Caz Hildebrand\" width=\"847\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eggs or no eggs? Jacob Kenedy and Caz Hildebrand\u2019s cannelloni.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>The sauce</h2> <p>Because cannelloni are baked, they need a sauce, rather than just the drizzle of melted butter you can get away with in other filled pastas. Bechamel and tomato are the two most common choices, and both put in an appearance in Caldesi\u2019s recipe. While in my opinion you can never have too much sauce, it cannot be denied that making two is double the work. What\u2019s more, the overwhelming preference of testers, with the honourable exception of the dog, is for the tomato version, on the basis that \u201cthe milky bechamel is too similar to the ricotta\u201d.</p> <p>You could just keep things very simple and, like Boswell, puree a tin of plum tomatoes, but we agree that the plainness of the filling demands a little more in the way of savoury oomph from the supporting sauce: Caldesi\u2019s long-simmered tomato passata, flavoured with vegetables and herbs, is just perfect.</p> <p>We also like her commitment to crisp edges \u2013 surely the best bit of almost any gratin \u2013 and to this end would recommend not covering the pasta completely with passata. Unless you\u2019re making this for a crowd, however, or have only a very small baking dish to hand, I wouldn\u2019t bother with two layers of cannelloni \u2013 sheltered from direct heat, the base layer inevitably goes soggy.</p> <p>In fact, in pursuit of maximum crunch, finishing the dish under the grill, as the Silver Spoon and Pasta Sapori d\u2019Italia suggest, is a very good idea indeed. Adding extra parmesan at this point is between you and your waistband.</p> <h2>Perfect spinach and ricotta cannelloni</h2> <p>Prep <strong>10 min</strong><br>Cook <strong>1 hr 20 plus cooling</strong><br>Serves <strong>2-4</strong></p> <p>For the pasta (or use 250g fresh egg lasagne sheets)<br><strong>170g \u201800\u2019 flour</strong><br><strong>80g semolina flour</strong><br><strong>1 big pinch salt</strong><br><strong>2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk</strong></p> <p>For the sauce<br><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br><strong>1 onion</strong>, peeled and cut in half<br><strong>1 carrot</strong>, cut in half lengthways<br><strong>1 celery stick</strong>, cut in half <br><strong>800g tinned plum tomatoes</strong><br><strong>1 small bunch </strong><strong>basil</strong><br><strong>Dash of balsamic vinegar</strong>, or \u00bd tsp sugar and a dash of wine vinegar</p> <p>For the filling<br><strong>250g fresh mature spinach</strong>, or 140g defrosted leaf spinach<br><strong>1 tbsp butter</strong><br><strong>1 small garlic clove</strong>, peeled and crushed<br><strong>175g fresh ricotta</strong><br><strong>30g Italian hard cheese</strong>, grated<br><strong>Nutmeg</strong></p> <p>Start with the pasta, if you\u2019re making it yourself.

Heading online, the ckbk digital library boasts precisely three results for spinach and ricotta cannelloni out of 75,000 on the site, leading me to suspect that, like balti, or General Tso\u2019s chicken, it\u2019s all but unknown in its apparent home country. My Rome correspondents Rachel Roddy and Kristina Gill, however, quickly disabuse me of that notion \u2013 indeed, Roddy tells me that at her local fresh pasta shop, cannelloni di ricotta e spinaci now sell better than the classic meat filling. Gill, however, after kindly trawling through \u201cmaybe 30 books\u201d in her more extensive collection, confirms that there are surprisingly few published recipes for it, even though The Silver Spoon, often cited as the authority on Italian cuisine, describes spinach and ricotta as the traditional filling for cannelloni. Perhaps the problem lies in the fact that it\u2019s also the classic choice for many other stuffed pastas, and even the crespelle (pancakes) often used instead of pasta in Abruzzo and Campania. The beauty of cannelloni, however, is that they\u2019re incredible easy to make, and bake, hence their popularity on restaurant menus. But what\u2019s the best way to go about it? The pasta First things first: the structure of the dish.

The best versions I try are, naturally, made with homemade egg pasta, and this is an occasion where including a proportion of semolina flour is a very good idea: with such a soft, mild filling, the pasta needs to retain a bit of bite.

Strangely enough, the dried tubes of cannelloni I remember from childhood seem to have disappeared from my local supermarket, though they are still available in larger stores.

The dairy Ricotta is, of course, the order of the day; I love it in all its forms, but with such a plain dish, it\u2019s worth buying some really good fresh stuff for this. Many recipes add grated hard cheese to the filling, too \u2013 usually grated parmesan, or grana padano in Boswell\u2019s recipe. Bear in mind that if you want to make this dish strictly vegetarian, you\u2019ll need to source a vegetarian alternative; they\u2019re widely available these days. Some recipes, though not all, add eggs to the filling as well \u2013 or just yolks in the case of Caz Hildebrand and Jacob Kenedy\u2019s The Geometry of Pasta \u2013 but I can\u2019t see the point; those without are just as good, and I think have a slightly softer, creamier texture. The sauce Because cannelloni are baked, they need a sauce, rather than just the drizzle of melted butter you can get away with in other filled pastas. Bechamel and tomato are the two most common choices, and both put in an appearance in Caldesi\u2019s recipe. While in my opinion you can never have too much sauce, it cannot be denied that making two is double the work. What\u2019s more, the overwhelming preference of testers, with the honourable exception of the dog, is for the tomato version, on the basis that \u201cthe milky bechamel is too similar to the ricotta\u201d. You could just keep things very simple and, like Boswell, puree a tin of plum tomatoes, but we agree that the plainness of the filling demands a little more in the way of savoury oomph from the supporting sauce: Caldesi\u2019s long-simmered tomato passata, flavoured with vegetables and herbs, is just perfect. We also like her commitment to crisp edges \u2013 surely the best bit of almost any gratin \u2013 and to this end would recommend not covering the pasta completely with passata. Unless you\u2019re making this for a crowd, however, or have only a very small baking dish to hand, I wouldn\u2019t bother with two layers of cannelloni \u2013 sheltered from direct heat, the base layer inevitably goes soggy. In fact, in pursuit of maximum crunch, finishing the dish under the grill, as the Silver Spoon and Pasta Sapori d\u2019Italia suggest, is a very good idea indeed. Adding extra parmesan at this point is between you and your waistband. Perfect spinach and ricotta cannelloni Prep 10 min Cook 1 hr 20 plus cooling Serves 2-4 For the pasta (or use 250g fresh egg lasagne sheets) 170g \u201800\u2019 flour 80g semolina flour 1 big pinch salt 2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk For the sauce 1 tbsp olive oil 1 onion, peeled and cut in half 1 carrot, cut in half lengthways 1 celery stick, cut in half 800g tinned plum tomatoes 1 small bunch basil Dash of balsamic vinegar, or \u00bd tsp sugar and a dash of wine vinegar For the filling 250g fresh mature spinach, or 140g defrosted leaf spinach 1 tbsp butter 1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed 175g fresh ricotta 30g Italian hard cheese, grated Nutmeg Start with the pasta, if you\u2019re making it yourself. Mix the flours and the salt, make a well in the middle, then pour in the whole eggs and egg yolk. Gradually mix in the flour until you have a dough you can bring together with your hands, adding a splash of water, if necessary. Knead for about 10 minutes, until it feels smooth and springs back when poked, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for an hour. Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a wide pan over a medium heat, add the onion, carrot and celery, and fry for a couple of minutes, until starting to brown. Tip in the tomatoes, basil and vinegar (or vinegar and sugar), bring everything up to a simmer, then turn down the heat and cook for about half an hour, until thick. Remove and discard the vegetables and herbs, then whizz the sauce with a hand blender (or mash) until fairly smooth, and season to taste. While the sauce is cooking, trim and discard any tough stalks from the spinach and wash the leaves well. Put the still-wet spinach in a saucepan over a medium heat, cover and cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until completely wilted, then run under cold water to prevent it cooking further. Once it\u2019s cool enough to handle, squeeze until dry, then chop finely. Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium-high heat, add the garlic, cook for a minute, then add the spinach. Saute to coat with the butter, then turn off and leave to cool. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface until it is about 1cm thick and will go through the widest setting of your pasta machine comfortably. Put it through each setting but the very narrowest twice \u2013 the sheets don\u2019t need to be paper-thin. Cut into pieces about 10cm long, blanch in boiling salted water for a minute, then drain on a clean tea towel. Heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/390F/gas 6. Mix the spinach with the ricotta and most of the grated cheese, reserving a handful for the top, and season well with nutmeg and salt. Cover the bottom of a medium baking tin with a thick layer of tomato sauce, then put a sausage of filling on the short end of one of the pasta squares and roll up, cutting away any excess once you have a slight overlap. Put the filled tube seam side down in the baking dish, and repeat with the remaining pasta and filling; you\u2019ll probably be left with some excess pasta, which will keep in the fridge for several days, stored between greaseproof paper. Tip the remaining sauce on top, leaving a margin around the edge, then bake for 30 minutes. To finish, scatter over the remaining grated cheese, grill until bubbling, then serve. \u2022 Spinach and ricotta cannelloni: an understated classic or rightly overlooked by cookbooks? Do you prefer the spinach-and-cheese filling in crespoline (pancakes), or are there other Italian vegetarian dishes you prefer to make instead?",

The testimonies speak of periods, orgasms and menopause. The women are young and old, Christian and Muslim, some battered by poverty and others buoyed by the wealth of the developed world. We hear them in their own words, without sentences being smoothed over or smartened up by Ali, and this unrefined directness means that while the prose lacks the poetry and formal artfulness of Ensler\u2019s play, it has a visceral drama.</p> <p>Ali delivers the physicality of the women\u2019s experiences with all the leaking, faecal, bloody mess of the body laid bare: the changing texture and colour of periods (brown at the start for many women); the vomiting fits brought on by hyperemesis (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/she-said/2014/sep/27/hyperemesis-gravidarum-kate-middletons-ongoing-condition-is-much-worse-than-just-morning-sickness\" title=\"\">a condition </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/she-said/2014/sep/27/hyperemesis-gravidarum-kate-middletons-ongoing-condition-is-much-worse-than-just-morning-sickness\" title=\"\">the Duchess of Cambridge has had</a> in pregnancy).

Zay, an 11-year-old Syrian refugee, starts her period while making the voyage to safety and speaks of the lack of sanitary products (\u201cThe boat was the scariest thing until the day I woke up covered in blood\u201d). There are those who live with the legacy of FGM and those who are married in exchange for chattels (40 cows and homemade beer in one instance).</p> <p>But it is not always the stories from faraway places that shock the most: Becky, a homeless woman in London, tells a dismaying story of having periods on the street and going into the local Burger King to staunch the blood with tissues. She has learned how to make sanitary pads out of cardboard, plastic bags and paper.</p> <p>Ali includes the sex talk between Somali women she grew up around, and cites Qur\u2019anic instruction for husbands to please their wives in bed. Many Muslims speak of their love of sex, their dominant role in bed, and seeking divorce when their husbands can no longer fulfil their sexual needs (\u201cI wanted to exercise that God-given right\u201d). Such welcome accounts sit alongside more familiar stories of control and coercion.</p> <p>Ali\u2019s own voice is uplifting, even if the corny puns \u2013 \u201cfannying around\u201d and \u201cdeep dives\u201d \u2013 wear thin. But while the narratives build a powerful chorus of lived experience, deeper reflection is lacking. And while they are culturally diverse, all her speakers appear to be heterosexual, cis women. They talk candidly of pleasure or lack of it in heterosexual sex, but no lesbian experience is documented. And there are only passing references to women who feel no tug towards motherhood.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d758e2e89e2c2292d3cd7b3d520f966e3aeee01e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d758e2e89e2c2292d3cd7b3d520f966e3aeee01e/208_48_815_489/500.jpg\" alt=\"Knowledgeable and discursive \u2026 Lynn Enright.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Knowledgeable and discursive \u2026 Lynn Enright.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Enright, in her book, has a richer awareness of these aspects.

More recently, she drew attention by speaking of Boris Johnson as a \u201creal champion of women\u2019s rights\u201d. For that reason, she said, \u201che is one of my feminist heroes\u201d. Like Ensler\u2019s play, her book is comprised of many women\u2019s voices; these are 42 accounts from 14 countries. The testimonies speak of periods, orgasms and menopause. The women are young and old, Christian and Muslim, some battered by poverty and others buoyed by the wealth of the developed world. We hear them in their own words, without sentences being smoothed over or smartened up by Ali, and this unrefined directness means that while the prose lacks the poetry and formal artfulness of Ensler\u2019s play, it has a visceral drama. Ali delivers the physicality of the women\u2019s experiences with all the leaking, faecal, bloody mess of the body laid bare: the changing texture and colour of periods (brown at the start for many women); the vomiting fits brought on by hyperemesis (a condition the Duchess of Cambridge has had in pregnancy). There is much more gore and discharge as women take us intimately through the first time they had sex or the vaginal splitting and ripping in childbirth, and it all reminds us how silenced this pain normally remains \u2013 often unspoken beyond whispering, all-female circles and little documented in literature. A woman named Faz gives birth in a refugee camp. Zay, an 11-year-old Syrian refugee, starts her period while making the voyage to safety and speaks of the lack of sanitary products (\u201cThe boat was the scariest thing until the day I woke up covered in blood\u201d). There are those who live with the legacy of FGM and those who are married in exchange for chattels (40 cows and homemade beer in one instance). But it is not always the stories from faraway places that shock the most: Becky, a homeless woman in London, tells a dismaying story of having periods on the street and going into the local Burger King to staunch the blood with tissues. She has learned how to make sanitary pads out of cardboard, plastic bags and paper. Ali includes the sex talk between Somali women she grew up around, and cites Qur\u2019anic instruction for husbands to please their wives in bed. Many Muslims speak of their love of sex, their dominant role in bed, and seeking divorce when their husbands can no longer fulfil their sexual needs (\u201cI wanted to exercise that God-given right\u201d). Such welcome accounts sit alongside more familiar stories of control and coercion. Ali\u2019s own voice is uplifting, even if the corny puns \u2013 \u201cfannying around\u201d and \u201cdeep dives\u201d \u2013 wear thin. But while the narratives build a powerful chorus of lived experience, deeper reflection is lacking. And while they are culturally diverse, all her speakers appear to be heterosexual, cis women. They talk candidly of pleasure or lack of it in heterosexual sex, but no lesbian experience is documented. And there are only passing references to women who feel no tug towards motherhood. Enright, in her book, has a richer awareness of these aspects. She acknowledges gay sex (86% of lesbians report reaching orgasm in sex compared with 65% of straight women, she tells us) and speaks of non-binary experiences: \u201cNot all girls and women have a vagina and \u2026 not everyone who has a vagina is a girl or a woman.\u201d Later, she writes: \u201cWhen a teenager who does not identify as female begins to menstruate, it can be particularly upsetting and discombobulating.\u201d The data she collects, by her own admission and apology, is focused largely on the west and her book does not have the emotional punch of Ali\u2019s but it has its own moving moments, and is knowledgeable and discursive, citing Simone de Beauvoir, Lena Dunham, Hilary Mantel (the latter two on living with endometriosis). It is in some ways an ideal accompaniment to Ali\u2019s distillation of personal experience. Together, they paint a vivid picture of contemporary female embodiment. Enright tells us, in one of her many illuminating facts, that a 2015 UK study found two-thirds of women were still \u201cembarrassed about saying the word \u2018vagina\u2019\u201d. Full demystification is far off. Yet a new truthfulness is surely emerging around the female body, post #MeToo, and there are signs of creeping progress. \u2022 What We\u2019re Told Not to Talk About (But We\u2019re Going to Anyway): Women\u2019s Voices from East London to Ethiopia is published by Viking (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "God bless the Levy Board, which has thrown its weight behind the idea of sectional times in British horse racing. This is an idea whose time has come, about 20 years ago, but we\u2019ve taken the devil\u2019s own time to do anything about it. The levy board has offered up \u00a3900,000 as a means of incentivising media rights holders to get their tracks producing sectional time data forthwith. Those rights holders will be paid a fixed sum by the levy board for each fixture for which data is published; that per-fixture payment will decrease next year and again in 2021, so that there\u2019s a lot to be gained by getting on with it now. The hope is that within a couple of years, to the strains of the hallelujah chorus, all British tracks will have a means in place of producing sectional times and at last we can all stop guessing about whether the early pace was fast or slow. When a race pans out in an odd-looking way, we\u2019ll have a helpful tool for investigating what happened. When a horse does something impressive, we\u2019ll have an extra bit of data to illustrate the achievement. The argument in favour of sectionals is often framed just now in terms of driving up betting interest in racing, and we can certainly hope it will have that effect. But there\u2019s so much more to the case for sectional timing, including the insights it could offer into fence placement or the use that could be made of it by stewards and handicappers. Fundamentally, sectional times help us to understand our sport and if that isn\u2019t worth a big chunk of money and a grim determination to push this project over the line, then I don\u2019t know what is. Of course, some tracks (notably Ascot and 12 courses owned by ARC) are already producing sectionals, so this scheme will be a fair reward for their efforts. On the other hand, I note that this initiative is all carrot and no stick, so I suppose there will still be executives who will let it whistle past their ear, leaving some of our tracks entering 2022 in a 1982 state of mind, and doubtless with some of the same sandwiches on sale.

But where now for Europe? | Timothy Garton Ash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mr Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika, with its emphasis on political and economic reform and on free choice, has let a genie out of the bottle whose effects are almost impossible to foresee and hard to control.</p> <p>His declaration yesterday, the culmination of efforts to find acceptance in the West for his drive to end the division of Europe, aims at defining the goals clearly enough to prevent the outbreak of political chaos and to narrow the East-West economic gap. He recognises that none of this can be achieved without reconciling Western interests with his own.</p> <p>He has put forward some new ideas, but also many old and tired ones. There is a jumble of proposals on security, economic and environmental co-operation, and a recognition that \u2018a world where military arsenals would be reduced, but where human rights would be violated, would not be a safe place\u2019.</p> <p>Mr Gorbachev was adamant that \u2018overcoming the division of Europe\u2019 was not to be interpreted as open season on socialism. The West had to accept that the states of Europe \u2018belong to different systems\u2019.</p> <p>Yet Mr Gorbachev insisted \u2018on the sovereign right of each people to choose their own social system at their own discretion\u2019 and said he could envisage \u2018a change in the social and political order in some countries\u2019.</p> <p>During each of his visits to Western Europe this year, the Soviet leader has been adamant that there was no design to decouple Western Europe from Nato or to detach West Germany from its western alliance.</p> <p>Mr Gorbachev repeated this yesterday, declaring that \u2018the Soviet Union and the United States are a natural part of the European international and political structure. Their involvement is not only justified, but also historically conditioned. No other approach is acceptable\u2019.</p> <p>The Soviet Union has put out feelers for a superpower summit later this year where European issues would have priority. But yesterday Mr Gorbachev spoke only of his proposal for a pan-European summit. It was high time, he asserted, for the successor generation to the leaders who signed the 1975 Helsinki Declaration to meet and review the options for a European Community in the 21st century.</p> <p><em>This is an edited extract. <a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/07/09/7_July_1989.jpg\">Read the article in full</a>.</em></p> <h2><a href=\"https://uploads.guim.co.uk/2019/07/09/Editorial_7_Jul_89.jpg\">Editorial: rather, the street where we live</a></h2> <p>7 July 1989</p> <p>It is not a European home that we need, but a European street of relaxed neighbours.

The alliance has concluded discussion on documents due to be signed today, which will call for more dialogue with the West on disarmament and lay out a vision of a world free of nuclear and chemical weapons.</p> <p>The pact appears more openly divided than at any time in its 34-year history over the pace of reforms to overcome mounting economic crisis and political stagnation. Moves by Poland and Hungary to end their Communist parties\u2019 four-decade monopoly of power have angered the ageing leaderships in Romania, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia.</p> <p>Mr Gorbachev demonstrated his even-handed approach by holding talks with Hungary\u2019s newly-elected reformist leader, Mr Rezso Nyers, while also displaying deference at the official banquet to Czechoslovakia\u2019s ailing hardline President, Gustav Husak. Apparently referring to the documents to be signed today, the Soviet leader said the pact had taken new steps to promote European security and dialogue between East and West.</p> <p>In recent times, there had been a new atmosphere, with the pact and Nato each willing to listen and talk to the other, he said. \u2018But there is still a war psychosis which we must overcome,\u2019 he added. \u2018We think it is necessary to stress the need for a shift from military to political moves.\u2019</p> <p>Mr Gorbachev was addressing the dinner in his capacity as host of next year\u2019s summit, which will be held in Moscow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30095464babb0397e3cce697318f9c4f6cb98b33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30095464babb0397e3cce697318f9c4f6cb98b33/0_102_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mikhail Gorbachev during a visit to the DDR.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mikhail Gorbachev during a visit to the DDR.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Niedenthal/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><br>Heady ideas of East and West unleash forces of change across Europe</h2> <p>by Hella Pick, diplomatic editor<br>14 July 1989</p> <p>If imagery alone counted in the superpower skirmishing over Europe\u2019s future, then Mr Mikhail Gorbachev would win hands down with his \u2018Common European Home\u2019.

Each is concerned to influence a continent in flux, and to maintain a modicum of stability at a time of far-reaching political change in a Western Europe dominated by the evolving EC, and in an Eastern Europe where Marxism has to come to terms with political pluralism and the market economy.</p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Gorbachev have succeeded rather better at exposing deep-seated problems than devising the solutions. They recognise that the East-West prosperity gap may turn out to be far more destabilising than the now diminishing military confrontation in Europe.</p> <p>The US President has learned first-hand, especially in Poland, that the trend towards democracy in Eastern Europe is not just undermining Soviet influence, but also creating political uncertainty and provoking impossibly high expectations of Western economic support.</p> <p>Mr Gorbachev has seen, especially in West Germany, that many Europeans have exaggerated confidence in his ability to guarantee peace in Europe.</p> <p>Even though the two leaders profess themselves eager to co-operate in Europe, they remain deeply suspicious of each other\u2019s intentions and it is unclear how much convergence there is in their European policies.</p> <p>Mr Gorbachev has developed a complex, not always coherent, picture of his aims in Europe. The Bonn Declaration, signed between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Union, is a formal repudiation of the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty. It also incorporates the Soviet leader\u2019s conviction that the US and Canada must be part and parcel of the European common home.</p> <p>It promises \u2018peaceful competition\u2019 and an enduring commitment to human rights. It points to disarmament and arms control as the key to strengthening the fabric of peace in Europe; but in deference to the Nato doctrine of nuclear deterrence omits any reference to President Gorbachev\u2018s belief in a Europe free of nuclear weapons.</p> <p>The declaration refers to the Nato and Warsaw Pact alliances, and assumes that the two political camps in Europe would be maintained.</p> <p>Yet in Strasbourg last week, Mr Gorbachev warned that there were limits to change in Eastern Europe. \u2018Overcoming the division of Europe\u2019 was not to be confused with \u2018overcoming socialism in Europe. There will be no European unity along these lines ... this is a course for confrontation.\u2019</p> <p>The Soviet leader is deeply suspicious of Mr Bush\u2019s interest in Eastern Europe and uncertain whether the logic of the US policy might not be to drive as many Eastern European countries as possible out of the Soviet orbit.</p> <p>President Bush has not tried to match Mr Gorbachev in expressing his ideas about overcoming the division of Europe. It is not certain that he is clear in his own mind how far the encouragement of democracy in Eastern Europe can safely be taken. It is easy enough to interpret Mr Bush\u2019s actions in Poland and Hungary as a conscious decision to exploit the Gorbachev-inspired political reforms for extending the West\u2019s zone of influence. That is certainly how the Bush call for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Poland was construed in Moscow.</p> <p>Yet, the US President has also been very careful to insist that it is not his intention to undermine Soviet security interests in Europe. This suggests that Mr Bush is ready to accept that the countries of Eastern Europe should maintain their membership of the Warsaw Pact, and that German self-determination is not on the agenda, at least for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>The question that neither leader can answer satisfactorily is what forces their policies have let loose in Europe. In the West, Germany has reclaimed a decisive role in Europe. In the East, Poland and Hungary are finding their own voice again. Others may follow.

      "bodyText": "Gorbachev outlines common home plan Soviet leader explains his vision for an undivided continent in the 21st century complete with free choice and economic reform by Hella Pick in Strasbourg 7 July 1989 President Mikhail Gorbachev yesterday outlined his vision of a \u2018unified European community for the 21st century\u2019, based on political reality and a doctrine of restraint and targeted on the creation of a \u2018vast economic space from the Atlantic to the Urals\u2019. But in his Council of Europe address, the Soviet leader admitted that his blueprint for the common European home is far from complete. Many of the post-war certainties have gone. Change in Europe is imminent and European leaders are now engaged in a race to manage the transition to a new Europe before anarchy breaks out. Mr Gorbachev\u2019s perestroika, with its emphasis on political and economic reform and on free choice, has let a genie out of the bottle whose effects are almost impossible to foresee and hard to control. His declaration yesterday, the culmination of efforts to find acceptance in the West for his drive to end the division of Europe, aims at defining the goals clearly enough to prevent the outbreak of political chaos and to narrow the East-West economic gap. He recognises that none of this can be achieved without reconciling Western interests with his own. He has put forward some new ideas, but also many old and tired ones. There is a jumble of proposals on security, economic and environmental co-operation, and a recognition that \u2018a world where military arsenals would be reduced, but where human rights would be violated, would not be a safe place\u2019. Mr Gorbachev was adamant that \u2018overcoming the division of Europe\u2019 was not to be interpreted as open season on socialism. The West had to accept that the states of Europe \u2018belong to different systems\u2019. Yet Mr Gorbachev insisted \u2018on the sovereign right of each people to choose their own social system at their own discretion\u2019 and said he could envisage \u2018a change in the social and political order in some countries\u2019. During each of his visits to Western Europe this year, the Soviet leader has been adamant that there was no design to decouple Western Europe from Nato or to detach West Germany from its western alliance. Mr Gorbachev repeated this yesterday, declaring that \u2018the Soviet Union and the United States are a natural part of the European international and political structure. Their involvement is not only justified, but also historically conditioned. No other approach is acceptable\u2019. The Soviet Union has put out feelers for a superpower summit later this year where European issues would have priority. But yesterday Mr Gorbachev spoke only of his proposal for a pan-European summit. It was high time, he asserted, for the successor generation to the leaders who signed the 1975 Helsinki Declaration to meet and review the options for a European Community in the 21st century. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full. Editorial: rather, the street where we live 7 July 1989 It is not a European home that we need, but a European street of relaxed neighbours. Put us all together - different clout, different systems - under one roof, and there would be domestic strife. That is the history of the old, bad, warring Europe. Set us side by side along an avenue and who knows what, in the end, may appear? Gorbachev tells allies to pursue own paths 8 July 1989 President Gorbachev hailed a \u2018new spirit\u2019 in the Warsaw Pact yesterday, telling his East European allies that each should be free to pursue its own path and respect that of others. \u2018There is a new spirit within the Warsaw Treaty, with moves towards independent solutions of national problems,\u2019 he said on the first day of the seven-nation alliance\u2019s annual summit. Mr Gorbachev, whose perestroika reform programme has brought to the surface long-standing tensions inside the pact, made clear he had no intention of using the Soviet Union\u2019s dominance of the alliance in favour of either side of the reform argument. \u2018We recognise the specifics of our parties and peoples on their path towards socialist democracy and further development,\u2019 he said. Mr Gorbachev was addressing the leaders of the pact\u2019s member states at a dinner in the banqueting hall of Bucharest\u2019s presidential palace. The alliance has concluded discussion on documents due to be signed today, which will call for more dialogue with the West on disarmament and lay out a vision of a world free of nuclear and chemical weapons. The pact appears more openly divided than at any time in its 34-year history over the pace of reforms to overcome mounting economic crisis and political stagnation. Moves by Poland and Hungary to end their Communist parties\u2019 four-decade monopoly of power have angered the ageing leaderships in Romania, East Germany, and Czechoslovakia. Mr Gorbachev demonstrated his even-handed approach by holding talks with Hungary\u2019s newly-elected reformist leader, Mr Rezso Nyers, while also displaying deference at the official banquet to Czechoslovakia\u2019s ailing hardline President, Gustav Husak. Apparently referring to the documents to be signed today, the Soviet leader said the pact had taken new steps to promote European security and dialogue between East and West. In recent times, there had been a new atmosphere, with the pact and Nato each willing to listen and talk to the other, he said. \u2018But there is still a war psychosis which we must overcome,\u2019 he added. \u2018We think it is necessary to stress the need for a shift from military to political moves.\u2019 Mr Gorbachev was addressing the dinner in his capacity as host of next year\u2019s summit, which will be held in Moscow. Heady ideas of East and West unleash forces of change across Europe by Hella Pick, diplomatic editor 14 July 1989 If imagery alone counted in the superpower skirmishing over Europe\u2019s future, then Mr Mikhail Gorbachev would win hands down with his \u2018Common European Home\u2019. The West has readily taken to discussing its architecture, its furnishing, even the rules that would govern the administration of the condominium. The Bush doctrine is about a \u2018Commonwealth of European Nations\u2019, a concept that is not easily translated into building bricks; all the less so when the Soviet Union suspects the President of seeking to roll back communism in Europe. But the two presidents have not been wooing Europe so assiduously merely to see which can coin the better phrase. Each is concerned to influence a continent in flux, and to maintain a modicum of stability at a time of far-reaching political change in a Western Europe dominated by the evolving EC, and in an Eastern Europe where Marxism has to come to terms with political pluralism and the market economy. Mr Bush and Mr Gorbachev have succeeded rather better at exposing deep-seated problems than devising the solutions. They recognise that the East-West prosperity gap may turn out to be far more destabilising than the now diminishing military confrontation in Europe. The US President has learned first-hand, especially in Poland, that the trend towards democracy in Eastern Europe is not just undermining Soviet influence, but also creating political uncertainty and provoking impossibly high expectations of Western economic support. Mr Gorbachev has seen, especially in West Germany, that many Europeans have exaggerated confidence in his ability to guarantee peace in Europe. Even though the two leaders profess themselves eager to co-operate in Europe, they remain deeply suspicious of each other\u2019s intentions and it is unclear how much convergence there is in their European policies. Mr Gorbachev has developed a complex, not always coherent, picture of his aims in Europe. The Bonn Declaration, signed between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Union, is a formal repudiation of the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty. It also incorporates the Soviet leader\u2019s conviction that the US and Canada must be part and parcel of the European common home. It promises \u2018peaceful competition\u2019 and an enduring commitment to human rights. It points to disarmament and arms control as the key to strengthening the fabric of peace in Europe; but in deference to the Nato doctrine of nuclear deterrence omits any reference to President Gorbachev\u2018s belief in a Europe free of nuclear weapons. The declaration refers to the Nato and Warsaw Pact alliances, and assumes that the two political camps in Europe would be maintained. Yet in Strasbourg last week, Mr Gorbachev warned that there were limits to change in Eastern Europe. \u2018Overcoming the division of Europe\u2019 was not to be confused with \u2018overcoming socialism in Europe. There will be no European unity along these lines ... this is a course for confrontation.\u2019 The Soviet leader is deeply suspicious of Mr Bush\u2019s interest in Eastern Europe and uncertain whether the logic of the US policy might not be to drive as many Eastern European countries as possible out of the Soviet orbit. President Bush has not tried to match Mr Gorbachev in expressing his ideas about overcoming the division of Europe. It is not certain that he is clear in his own mind how far the encouragement of democracy in Eastern Europe can safely be taken. It is easy enough to interpret Mr Bush\u2019s actions in Poland and Hungary as a conscious decision to exploit the Gorbachev-inspired political reforms for extending the West\u2019s zone of influence. That is certainly how the Bush call for the withdrawal of all Soviet troops from Poland was construed in Moscow. Yet, the US President has also been very careful to insist that it is not his intention to undermine Soviet security interests in Europe. This suggests that Mr Bush is ready to accept that the countries of Eastern Europe should maintain their membership of the Warsaw Pact, and that German self-determination is not on the agenda, at least for the foreseeable future. The question that neither leader can answer satisfactorily is what forces their policies have let loose in Europe. In the West, Germany has reclaimed a decisive role in Europe. In the East, Poland and Hungary are finding their own voice again. Others may follow. For the time being, they are willing to recognise the geopolitical constraints imposed by Moscow, like membership of the Warsaw Pact. But independence and democracy are heady ideas, and neither Bush doctrine nor the Common European Home may be able to contain them. This is an edited extract. Read the article in full.

      "body": "<h2>Tap into the potential of youth</h2> <p>Lampard oversaw Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori thriving in the Championship at Derby. Now he must hope that pair, alongside players such as Tammy Abraham, Reece James, Jake Clarke-Salter, Ethan Ampadu and, once fit, Callum Hudson-Odoi, excel at the higher level. Chelsea\u2019s academy has craved an opportunity for its graduates to demonstrate their abilities and step up into first-team reckoning en masse. The Fifa transfer ban, and the appointment of an empathetic coach, may mean that time is now. Talk of greater integration between seniors and academy groups is an encouraging start.</p> <h2>Coax more from the experienced fringe players</h2> <p>There are senior players, some secured for significant sums, who must step into the breach as well. Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko was shipped off to Milan on loan last term, while Michy Batshuayi (Valencia and Crystal Palace) and Kurt Zouma (Everton) will also hope to make an impact back at their parent club. Mateo Kovacic, last year\u2019s loanee from Real Madrid, has to be more productive now he has joined for \u00a344.8m and even Danny Drinkwater, classed as a homegrown player in European competition, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/05/frank-lampard-chelsea-drinkwater-batshuayi\" title=\"\">may have a role </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/05/frank-lampard-chelsea-drinkwater-batshuayi\" title=\"\">again</a>. There may now be a sense of regret that the loan deal which took Victor Moses to Fenerbahce stretches to 2020. \u00c1lvaro Morata is to join Atl\u00e9tico Madrid when his loan there expires at the end of the season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"275d1afee790c188545cf6eb27b0c593e4c02355\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/275d1afee790c188545cf6eb27b0c593e4c02355/0_268_3679_2208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko in action for Milan in May 2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko in action for Milan in May 2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Miguel Medina/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Convince Willian to stay</h2> <p>The Brazilian seems to be linked with clubs such as Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico in every transfer window, which may be to his representative\u2019s credit, and is entering the final 12 months of his contract. At 30, the winger might not normally be the type of player Chelsea would seek to retain. But, given the constricts of the transfer ban, they can ill afford to lose him and will be reluctant to watch him depart for nothing next summer. Convincing him to follow David Luiz\u2019s lead and commit his future could be beneficial.</p> <h2>Shape his coaching staff</h2> <p>The time feels right for a revamp of the coaching staff. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s bloated backroom team have been moved on or are being ushered into different roles, and Joe Edwards, highly regarded having worked with the youth set-up and, more recently, the development squad, is rising into the first-team picture with Eddie Newton.

      "bodyText": "Tap into the potential of youth Lampard oversaw Mason Mount and Fikayo Tomori thriving in the Championship at Derby. Now he must hope that pair, alongside players such as Tammy Abraham, Reece James, Jake Clarke-Salter, Ethan Ampadu and, once fit, Callum Hudson-Odoi, excel at the higher level. Chelsea\u2019s academy has craved an opportunity for its graduates to demonstrate their abilities and step up into first-team reckoning en masse. The Fifa transfer ban, and the appointment of an empathetic coach, may mean that time is now. Talk of greater integration between seniors and academy groups is an encouraging start. Coax more from the experienced fringe players There are senior players, some secured for significant sums, who must step into the breach as well. Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko was shipped off to Milan on loan last term, while Michy Batshuayi (Valencia and Crystal Palace) and Kurt Zouma (Everton) will also hope to make an impact back at their parent club. Mateo Kovacic, last year\u2019s loanee from Real Madrid, has to be more productive now he has joined for \u00a344.8m and even Danny Drinkwater, classed as a homegrown player in European competition, may have a role again. There may now be a sense of regret that the loan deal which took Victor Moses to Fenerbahce stretches to 2020. \u00c1lvaro Morata is to join Atl\u00e9tico Madrid when his loan there expires at the end of the season. Convince Willian to stay The Brazilian seems to be linked with clubs such as Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico in every transfer window, which may be to his representative\u2019s credit, and is entering the final 12 months of his contract. At 30, the winger might not normally be the type of player Chelsea would seek to retain. But, given the constricts of the transfer ban, they can ill afford to lose him and will be reluctant to watch him depart for nothing next summer. Convincing him to follow David Luiz\u2019s lead and commit his future could be beneficial. Shape his coaching staff The time feels right for a revamp of the coaching staff. Maurizio Sarri\u2019s bloated backroom team have been moved on or are being ushered into different roles, and Joe Edwards, highly regarded having worked with the youth set-up and, more recently, the development squad, is rising into the first-team picture with Eddie Newton. Incorporating Didier Drogba or Claude Makelele, as familiar faces from a glittering recent past, as Petr Cech takes up his technical role, would add to the sense that Chelsea have restored some of their soul. Convince Roman to return Roman Abramovich\u2019s has not been a visible presence at Stamford Bridge in two years.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, A Private War\u2019s Matthew Heineman will write and direct a film set against the backdrop of the Camp Fire, named for its point of origin on Camp Creek Road in Butte County, which killed 85 people and destroyed the small town of Paradise. Heineman\u2019s film will focus on the real-life story of Heather Roebuck, who was forced to flee the town\u2019s Feather River hospital minutes after giving birth. Roebuck chronicled her ordeal in a Facebook post, in which she explained she was unable to walk after her operation, was separated from her baby and that the ambulance she was initially placed in almost immediately caught fire. Heineman said in a statement: \u201cHeather\u2019s journey of inner strength in the face of unparalleled and unexpected adversity is one of the most exciting and visceral stories that I\u2019ve ever encountered.\u201d",

One photographer quoted in the Siberian Times described the water as smelling of \u201claundry detergent\u201d.

      "bodyText": "A Russian energy company has warned Instagram users not to swim in a mesmerising turquoise lake nicknamed the \u201cSiberian Maldives\u201d because it is actually an ash dump filled with harmful metal oxides. But despite warnings that the artificial pond contains dangerous calcium salts and other metal oxides, it has remained a popular site for selfies, wedding parties and scantily clad photoshoots. \u201cIn the last week, our ash dump has become a celebrity on social networks,\u201d the Siberian Generating Company said last month, warning potential visitors not to drink the water and saying that even \u201cskin contact with the water can lead to an allergic reaction\u201d. Photographs of women in bikinis lying on the ash dump\u2019s dirt banks and of visitors riding inflatable unicorns on the azure waters have gone viral on social networks. Some users joked about the taste of the water as \u201cchalky\u201d or \u201csweet,\u201d though it was not clear if they were being serious. One photographer quoted in the Siberian Times described the water as smelling of \u201claundry detergent\u201d. The water\u2019s pH is higher than 8, the company said. The dump is man-made and contains the ash that results from burning coal at the nearby thermal power station, which provides energy to the city of Novosibirsk. It was built in the 1970s and is the largest of its kind in Siberia. Swimmers may not be able to escape the dangerous waters, the company warned. The bottom of the ash dump is muddy, meaning that \u201cgetting out of the reservoir without help is practically impossible\u201d. After an explosion of interest on social media, the company said it had been forced to warn potential visitors that \u201cwalking along the ash dump is like walking on a military firing range: dangerous and undesirable. \u201cSO WE VERY MUCH ASK THAT THOSE CHASING SELFIES NOT FALL INTO THE ASH DUMP!\u201d continued the energy company\u2019s statement. \u201cTHIS IS THE GREATEST RISK.\u201d Unfortunately, the warnings seem only to have attracted more visitors and even a fan account called Novosibirsk Maldives that has collected nearly 200 posts from the ash dump\u2019s beguiling waters. One post suggested that so many tourists had begun visiting the site that local thieves had started breaking into cars while visitors took photographs. Another wrote that the power station\u2019s management had begun closing roads to the ash dump because of the \u201cbig flow of people from Novosibirsk\u201d to the site. A woman posing in a wedding dress with her husband by the lake wrote: \u201cThere is no limit to my happiness. How long have I wanted such a tender, sensual, memorable #lovestory. And it came true.\u201d",

      "body": "<p>I wouldn\u2019t normally air my dirty literary linen in public, but here goes. When I finished writing my novel Putney, about a 13-year-old girl who has a \u201clove affair\u201d in the 1970s with an older man and realises decades later that it was actually abuse, my previous editor at Jonathan Cape chose not to publish it. The reasons emerged this year when <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/2019/03/would-any-publisher-dare-to-print-lolita-now/\">he was interviewed in the Spectator</a>. \u201cIf Lolita was offered to me today,\u201d Dan Franklin said, \u201cI\u2019d never be able to get it past the acquisition team \u2013 a committee of 30-year-olds, who\u2019d say: \u2018If you publish this book we will all resign.\u2019\u201d He pointed to #MeToo and social media as fundamental factors: \u201cYou can organise outrage at the drop of a hat.\u201d</p> <p>Fortunately, Bloomsbury\u2019s acquisition team \u2013 overwhelmingly female and mixed aged \u2013 were brave enough to take on Putney, which was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/16/putney-sofka-zinovieff-review\">described in the Observer as \u201ca Lolita for the era of #MeToo\u201d</a>. Whether there was any truth in his words or not, Franklin\u2019s position reveals how much fear now exists in publishing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/16/putney-sofka-zinovieff-review\">Putney by Sofka Zinovieff review \u2013 a Lolita for the age of #MeToo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The balance of power between the sexes is famously a battlefield, in both life and literature, and right now we\u2019re caught in the crossfire between generations. Historically, the old imposed their traditions and moral codes on the young, but now the young are frequently calling the shots, particularly over issues of gender, sex and power. Over the last decade or so, we\u2019ve witnessed revolutionary change. Many older men and celebrities who thought they had got away with child abuse are now in prison. We used to accept and even laugh at underage \u201cgroupies\u201d sleeping with pop stars; now, they are unmistakably victims. We are also reappraising what the burgeoning sexual freedoms of the 1960s and 70s achieved for women, as discussed so interestingly in Virginia Nicholson\u2019s recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/20/how-was-it-for-you-virginia-nicholson-review\">How Was it For You?</a> And with every subsequent revelation of the #MeToo movement, my 80s youth has begun to look more grotesque and unintelligible to my daughters\u2019 generation, which is versed in notions of gender equality and consent.</p> <p>It is younger people who are clearest about consent, what constitutes abuse, what may be said and by whom. Their seniors, who lived through the sexual revolution, are the ones who claim it\u2019s complicated. This generational disconnect is about more than the Gallic storm of outrage at #MeToo from Catherine Deneuve and others, who stood up for seduction as opposed to what they saw as irritatingly puritanical, Anglo-Saxon political correctness. In a recent interview, Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love, said that despite being a \u201cfanatic supporter\u201d of #MeToo, the focus on consent had made the role of women very passive, their input \u201conly to either concede or to deny\u201d. Since Aristophanes\u2019 Lysistrata, sexuality has been used as a bargaining chip, but as Gilbert asked, what about predatory female desire, \u201cout on the prowl\u201d?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018It\u2019s only about not being an arsehole,\u2019 my daughter said. \u2018That\u2019s not so difficult\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I asked my 23-year-old daughter whether there was sometimes too much emphasis on consent, she retorted: \u201cYou can\u2019t debate the importance of consent when rape is still such a big issue. It\u2019s confusing priorities.\u201d</p> <p>I tried again with my 26-year-old daughter. \u201cIt must sometimes be hard these days for sensitive, intelligent, young men,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have to be so careful about what they can say and do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s only about not being an arsehole,\u201d she replied curtly. \u201cThat\u2019s not so difficult. It\u2019s just speaking and behaving with respect.\u201d</p> <p>Millennials are frequently nonplussed by their parents\u2019 generation\u2019s murkier approach to everything from sex to the environment. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a complete moral earthquake,\u201d said Andrew Marr, when I found myself sitting next to him at a dinner recently. \u201cWe\u2019re being judged by our children as morally corrupt.\u201d</p> <p>Any policing performed by young people is surely part of a wider fight, against the horrifying extremes of the far right, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and pornography.

      "bodyText": "I wouldn\u2019t normally air my dirty literary linen in public, but here goes. When I finished writing my novel Putney, about a 13-year-old girl who has a \u201clove affair\u201d in the 1970s with an older man and realises decades later that it was actually abuse, my previous editor at Jonathan Cape chose not to publish it. The reasons emerged this year when he was interviewed in the Spectator. \u201cIf Lolita was offered to me today,\u201d Dan Franklin said, \u201cI\u2019d never be able to get it past the acquisition team \u2013 a committee of 30-year-olds, who\u2019d say: \u2018If you publish this book we will all resign.\u2019\u201d He pointed to #MeToo and social media as fundamental factors: \u201cYou can organise outrage at the drop of a hat.\u201d Fortunately, Bloomsbury\u2019s acquisition team \u2013 overwhelmingly female and mixed aged \u2013 were brave enough to take on Putney, which was described in the Observer as \u201ca Lolita for the era of #MeToo\u201d. Whether there was any truth in his words or not, Franklin\u2019s position reveals how much fear now exists in publishing. The balance of power between the sexes is famously a battlefield, in both life and literature, and right now we\u2019re caught in the crossfire between generations. Historically, the old imposed their traditions and moral codes on the young, but now the young are frequently calling the shots, particularly over issues of gender, sex and power. Over the last decade or so, we\u2019ve witnessed revolutionary change. Many older men and celebrities who thought they had got away with child abuse are now in prison. We used to accept and even laugh at underage \u201cgroupies\u201d sleeping with pop stars; now, they are unmistakably victims. We are also reappraising what the burgeoning sexual freedoms of the 1960s and 70s achieved for women, as discussed so interestingly in Virginia Nicholson\u2019s recent How Was it For You? And with every subsequent revelation of the #MeToo movement, my 80s youth has begun to look more grotesque and unintelligible to my daughters\u2019 generation, which is versed in notions of gender equality and consent. It is younger people who are clearest about consent, what constitutes abuse, what may be said and by whom. Their seniors, who lived through the sexual revolution, are the ones who claim it\u2019s complicated. This generational disconnect is about more than the Gallic storm of outrage at #MeToo from Catherine Deneuve and others, who stood up for seduction as opposed to what they saw as irritatingly puritanical, Anglo-Saxon political correctness. In a recent interview, Elizabeth Gilbert, author of Eat, Pray, Love, said that despite being a \u201cfanatic supporter\u201d of #MeToo, the focus on consent had made the role of women very passive, their input \u201conly to either concede or to deny\u201d. Since Aristophanes\u2019 Lysistrata, sexuality has been used as a bargaining chip, but as Gilbert asked, what about predatory female desire, \u201cout on the prowl\u201d? When I asked my 23-year-old daughter whether there was sometimes too much emphasis on consent, she retorted: \u201cYou can\u2019t debate the importance of consent when rape is still such a big issue. It\u2019s confusing priorities.\u201d I tried again with my 26-year-old daughter. \u201cIt must sometimes be hard these days for sensitive, intelligent, young men,\u201d I said. \u201cThey have to be so careful about what they can say and do.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only about not being an arsehole,\u201d she replied curtly. \u201cThat\u2019s not so difficult. It\u2019s just speaking and behaving with respect.\u201d Millennials are frequently nonplussed by their parents\u2019 generation\u2019s murkier approach to everything from sex to the environment. \u201cWe\u2019re going through a complete moral earthquake,\u201d said Andrew Marr, when I found myself sitting next to him at a dinner recently. \u201cWe\u2019re being judged by our children as morally corrupt.\u201d Any policing performed by young people is surely part of a wider fight, against the horrifying extremes of the far right, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia and pornography. These are worrying and challenging times. But while my daughters think it is obvious where the boundary lines are drawn, in my middle-aged and older friends I regularly detect bewilderment and even nervousness about navigating the newly drawn-up terrain. There is a sense that one might cross a linguistic or philosophical boundary by mistake, and that even with the best intentions, the border patrol might be heavily armed. Are young people merely more vocal and influential in their criticism, because of factors like social media, or are they actually trying to censor what is being said? \u201cI have to be very careful what I say,\u201d admitted a university lecturer and writer friend. \u201cI now think about the books I choose to teach, both in the context of their literary value and in the context of what might cause offence or upset.\u201d She added, \u201cI\u2019m always aware that a morning classroom conversation can become an afternoon Twitter storm.\u201d John Sutherland, author of Offensive Literature: Decensorship in Britain, 1960-1982, suggested to me that what we are now witnessing is \u201cre-censorship\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s like Anthony Burgess\u2019s idea that Pelagian liberalism alternates historically with Augustinian conservatism,\u201d he said. \u201cWe move between these poles and are now heading towards the latter, at least in terms of literature.\u201d As emeritus professor at UCL, he blames part of it on university fees: \u201cIt\u2019s a struggle for power.

Acosta proposed 80% cuts to anti-sex trafficking agency Donald Trump has said he \u201cfeels badly\u201d for his labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, over accusations that he helped Jeffrey Epstein to escape justice in 2008, when Acosta was a top prosecutor in Florida and the billionaire financier first stood accused of child abuse crimes. Epstein was charged with sex trafficking in New York this week. Acosta, meanwhile, is proposing to slash funding to the government agency that combats child sex trafficking by 80%. \u2018Terrific guy\u2019.

      "bodyText": "Arsenal are to sign the St Etienne defender William Saliba for \u20ac30m (\u00a327m) and loan him back to the French club for the 2019-20 season. The coveted 18-year-old has agreed a five-year deal with the Gunners and the two clubs are only minor details away from concluding the transfer. Unai Emery, the Arsenal manager, is having to work with a restricted budget this transfer window but the deal for Saliba will not affect any potential signings this summer. Arsenal have tracked Saliba for some time and have beaten a host of clubs to his signature. The defender made his debut for St Etienne in September 2018 and made 16 league appearances for the club last season. He has played for France at all age groups from under-16 to under-20 level. The club have also signed the highly rated Brazilian Gabriel Martinelli, also 18 years old, from Ituano but have seen a host of players leave, including Aaron Ramsey, Danny Welbeck, Stephan Lichtsteiner and David Ospina. Edu, the club\u2019s former midfielder, was unveiled as the new technical director on Tuesday. \u201cIn his role as technical director, Edu will coordinate the work of our first-team coaching group, the academy and player scouting and recruitment in order to oversee the constant building up and efficient strengthening of our squad,\u201d the club said in a statement.",

      "body": "<p>Burma is such an enigmatic country that the first question for any writer is what to call it. The nation has been known officially as Myanmar since 1989, when the then ruling junta discarded Burma along with other place names associated with British rule. But like all the decisions taken by the generals, it was made without any consultation with the population. The junta saw themselves as absolute monarchs and denied Burma\u2019s peoples both democracy and human rights.</p> <p>It is for that reason that the UK and US governments continue to use Burma as the country\u2019s official name. So do I in my book, <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/savage-dreamland-9781408883877.html\">A</a><em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/savage-dreamland-9781408883877.html\"> </a></em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/savage-dreamland-9781408883877.html\">Savage Dreamland: Journeys in Burma</a>, as do all the writers listed below. But neither Burma nor Myanmar does justice to such an ethnically diverse nation. In Burmese, both names are explicit references to the Bamar \u2013 the majority ethnic group \u2013 and have little resonance for the 134 officially recognised minorities who make up at least a third of the country\u2019s population.</p> <p>I was inspired to write about Burma in part because it is such a dizzying mix of peoples, religions and landscapes. Yet, for all the diversity, Burma remains the least-known nation in south-east Asia and there is little contemporary writing about the country. That\u2019s another legacy of the generals, who seized power in 1962 and ruled for almost 50 years. Not only did the junta censor local writers ruthlessly, often imprisoning them, they also sought to close off the country from the outside world.</p> <p>Even now, with Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s government running Burma in an uneasy partnership with the military, press freedom remains a distant ideal. The country is full of voracious readers, though. In the historic downtown of Yangon \u2013 the former capital once known as Rangoon \u2013 there are many streetside book vendors, their battered and dusty tomes laid out on the pavements for passing pedestrians to sift through.</p> <p>Pirate copies of George Orwell\u2019s Burmese Days are a staple of those stalls. It\u2019s a telling fact that it remains the most widely read English-language book about Burma, despite being first published in 1934. Almost all the finest travel writing on Burma was written before or just after the second world war. My book is an effort to redress the dearth of recent literature covering the country. Here is some of the finest writing on Burma that is available in English.</p> <p><strong>1. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/burmese-days-2.html\">Burmese Days by George Orwell</a><br></strong>The sweet sibilance of the title alone makes this a compulsory choice. Orwell spent five years in Burma in the 1920s as a policeman, alternately racked with self-loathing over his role as a colonial enforcer and enraged by the locals\u2019 increasing disdain for the British presence in their country. All that bile came out in this devastating portrait of small-minded, deeply racist Brits in a tiny up-country town. It is a damning indictment of imperial rule.</p> <p><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/apr/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview20\">From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odyssey by Pascal Khoo Thwe<br></a></strong>Pascal Khoo Thwe writes about his extraordinary journey from Shan state to Cambridge University in prose that makes a nonsense of the fact that English is his \u201csecond\u201d language. From his earliest years in a remote village still gripped by the animist beliefs that held sway in Burma before Buddhism arrived, it takes in the 1988 pro-democracy uprising that made Aung San Suu Kyi a global name and his time as a soldier in a rebel army in the jungles of southern Burma. The story would be almost unbelievable if it wasn\u2019t true.</p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.travelbooks.co.uk/norman-lewis-1/2017/5/24/book-review-golden-earth\">Golden Earth: Travels in Burma by Norman Lewis</a><br></strong>Lewis was one of the greats of 20th-century travel writing and he is at his evocative and empathetic best in this account of his 1951 sojourn in Burma. Arriving just three years after independence, Lewis encountered a country already fracturing along political and ethnic lines. Perhaps the most astonishing thing about the book is that it highlights how little fundamental change there has been in Burma since it was written.</p> <p><strong>4. <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/golden-parasol-a-daughters-memoir-of-burma-by-wendy-law-yone-990nbq76x96\">Golden Parasol: A Daughter\u2019s Memoir of Burma by Wendy Law-Yone</a><br></strong>The 1950s are remembered in Yangon as a charmed decade, when Burma was newly independent and the military had yet to snatch power. Law-Yone\u2019s affectionate, honest and moving memoir tracks how that optimism turned to disillusionment and then terror after the 1962 coup, through the story of her family and especially her father, a larger-than-life newspaper editor who was imprisoned by the generals before going into unhappy exile in the US.</p> <p><strong>5. <a href=\"https://frontiermyanmar.net/en/maurice-collis-colonial-burmas-forgotten-author\">Into Hidden Burma by Maurice Collis</a><br></strong>Collis was one of the more unusual British officials to come to Burma in the colonial era. A frustrated poet, he wept as he boarded the boat to leave the country for the last time, having fallen out of favour because of his sympathy for the Burmese and their desire for independence. This autobiography follows his postings across the country, from Rakhine state to the far south via Yangon and the Ayeyarwady Delta, and offers an insider\u2019s account of British rule.</p> <p><strong>6. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/miss-burma.html\">Miss Burma by Charmaine Craig</a><br></strong>Inspired by the remarkable true story of Craig\u2019s mother, whose father was Indian Jewish and whose mother was from the Karen minority in southern Burma, this novel deftly mixes fact and fiction. It relates the story of Craig\u2019s mother from her childhood and time as a 1950s beauty queen and film star, up to the point where she renounced her glamorous Rangoon life to become a commander in a guerrilla army fighting for an independent Karen state.</p> <p><strong>7. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/quartered-safe-out-here.html\">Quartered Safe Out Here: A Recollection of the War in Burma by George MacDonald Fraser</a><br></strong>Flashman, MacDonald Fraser\u2019s inspired fictional creation, never made it to Burma. But Fraser spent two years there during the second world war, fighting the Japanese. Told from an infantryman\u2019s necessarily narrow perspective, this account of his war \u2013 its title lifted from Kipling \u2013 is starkly unsentimental. But Fraser\u2019s wonderful ear for dialogue is on display throughout, as is his talent for bringing alive the realities of battle.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3581923f03898420b7b9df8528dab777a6b2befe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3581923f03898420b7b9df8528dab777a6b2befe/0_449_4608_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of statues of monks collecting alms surround the massive Win Sein Taw Ya Buddha in Mawlamyine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of statues of monks collecting alms surround the massive Win Sein Taw Ya Buddha in Mawlamyine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.fantasticfiction.com/m/w-somerset-maugham/gentleman-in-parlour.htm\">The Gentleman in the Parlour: A Record of a Journey from Rangoon to Haiphong by W Somerset Maugham</a><br></strong>Somerset Maugham is associated more with sundowners on South Sea islands, and the high life on the French Riviera, than with intrepid travel writing. But the Burma leg of his 1922 tour through south-east Asia saw him spend weeks moving by mule through the jungle and hills of Shan state, a journey that would be challenging even now. Maugham was an acute observer of both people and landscapes and, today, the book reads almost as an elegy for a long-gone culture.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/14/top-10-books-about-south-korea\">Top 10 books about South Korea</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>9. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/books/13grim.html\">The River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burma by Thant Myint-U<br></a></strong>Another title taken from Kipling, Thant Myint-U roams through Burma\u2019s early history, the colonial period, independence and the junta\u2019s rule, interspersing personal reminiscences along the way. There\u2019s a patrician tone to the writing, as you might expect from the Harvard and Cambridge-educated grandson of U Thant, UN secretary general in the 1960s, but this is perhaps the best general introduction to Burma\u2019s convoluted history.</p> <p><strong>10. <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-dragon.html\">Under the Dragon </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/under-the-dragon.html\"> by Rory MacLean</a><br></strong>This is one of the few travel books written about Burma in the junta era. Maclean brings a novelist\u2019s eye to the people he encounters on his quest to discover the origins of a basket brought from Burma to England in colonial times. More than anything, Maclean is superb at capturing the contradictions of the country under the generals, a place where beauty, gentleness and a deep religious faith coexisted with venal brutality.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/savage-dreamland-9781408883877.html\">A Savage Dreamland: Journeys in Burma by David Eimer</a> is published by Bloomsbury.

      "bodyText": "The man who killed New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern\u2019s cat has reportedly broken his silence, more than a year after he ran over the first cat of New Zealand. Shortly after Ardern became the prime minister-elect in October 2017, her polydactyl cat named Paddles shot to fame, and even had her own Twitter account. Paddles died in October 2017 after being hit by a car near Ardern\u2019s Point Chevalier home. Her death made the news around the world. Now the neighbour who hit the prime minister\u2019s cat in his car has spoken out for the first time, telling Stuff.co.nz that, after hitting Paddles, he wasn\u2019t sure if the cat was still alive, because she had run off after the collision. When he asked a female neighbour about the cat, and said it was ginger, the man became alarmed. \u201cShe said \u2018That\u2019s my neighbour\u2019s cat\u2019,\u201d the man going by the name of Chris explained. \u201cI pointed at [Ardern\u2019s] house and said: \u2018Not this neighbour!\u2019\u201d Chris said he took Paddles to the vet but it was too late. Chris said he wrote a condolence card for Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford. In the card Chris\u2019s daughter said she hoped Ardern would not send him to prison for running over the first cat. Later on, Ardern called Chris to say thank you for the card and to apologise for the ordeal, according to the report. \u201cIt was extremely nice of her to take time out of her day to check that I was OK for running over her cat,\u201d he said. Ardern and Gayford\u2019s daughter Neve was born just over one year ago. Ardern is currently on holiday with Gayford and Neve in Rarotonga.",

But a decision has to be made, both on the part of Ellis and her boss, the US Soccer Federation.</p> <p>Sources tell the Guardian that Ellis\u2019s contract expired in July 2018 and was extended with a pay increase from around $300,000 to $500,000.

Heading into this World Cup and even during it, she was questioned over a litany of decisions. Testing young players and cutting veterans. Trying new formations. Anointing Alyssa Naeher as the starting goalkeeper. Converting attacker Crystal Dunn to left-back. Not bringing more defensive depth to France. Moving Julie Ertz to central midfield.

      "body": "<p>There are times when Stuart Baxter surveys the agonies surrounding South Africa\u2019s football team and asks himself whether the benefits really add up. \u201cIt\u2019s not one of those you get used to,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re constantly wondering if it\u2019s worth it. Constantly.\u201d</p> <p>It is easier to answer that question during a week when, against all odds, Bafana Bafana have hauled themselves back among Africa\u2019s elite. Baxter calls South Africa \u201ca country of extremes\u201d and he should know, given that he is two years into his second spell managing the national team. On Saturday night the dial swung to paroxysms of euphoria as they outplayed Egypt, host country of the Africa Cup of Nations, in front of a baying home crowd and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/africa-cup-of-nations-nigeria-dump-out-holders-cameroon-egypt-south-africa\" title=\"\">reached the last eight with a 1-0 win</a>. For the 65-year-old Baxter, taking South Africa through to next Friday\u2019s final would be the pinnacle of a globetrotting career that has never been defined by his Anglo-Scottish upbringing.</p> <p>\u201cWinning this would be the biggest,\u201d he says, with Nigeria posing the next challenge in Wednesday\u2019s quarter-final. \u201cWithout sounding egotistical I think this would represent a massive personal victory for me, partly because it\u2019d be coming far more quickly than it should and partly because this is such a big tournament.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/africa-cup-of-nations-nigeria-dump-out-holders-cameroon-egypt-south-africa\">Africa Cup of Nations: Hosts Egypt stunned by late South Africa strike</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was 1996 when South Africa, only four years out of a lengthy Fifa suspension and still buoyant in the early stage of Nelson Mandela\u2019s presidency, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jun/24/south-africa-cup-of-nations-mandela-1996-bafana-bafana\" title=\"\">won their first and only Cup of Nations</a>. Baxter has brought Mark Fish, their defensive cornerstone back then, into his backroom staff to maintain a connection but he is at pains to point out that so much has changed since then. At that time Bafana Bafana, managed by Clive Barker, could ride the wave all the way home; these days they face a smothering pall of negativity that he believes places unrealistic demands on the sport\u2019s role.</p> <p>\u201cThe whole country was full of optimism in \u201996,\u201d he says. \u201cFull of hope and belief in the future. I think the team reflected that hope. When we beat Libya to qualify this time, the sports ministry wrote to me and said: \u2018You\u2019ve given the country hope\u2019, and for me that\u2019s where all this negativity stems from.</p> <p>\u201cIf the country is dependent on a result by the national team to give it hope, we fail. We can give it hope for five minutes, but every defeat is met with such negativity because on wider level those hopes and dreams have been flattened. There\u2019s too much going wrong in the country: getting the electricity shut down every day, the water shortages, the unemployment, you name it. The country\u2019s not hopeful and they\u2019re in a mental stage of depression; I think that gets reflected. They cannot accept any more negativity so one bad result is met by a tirade.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t give the country hope. We can\u2019t. Only temporarily. I\u2019m just happy we can give them a night off where they can wear the shirt proudly.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4167\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up to The Recap\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks and the biggest sports stories\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Africa lost to Ivory Coast and Morocco during the group stage, squeaking past lowly Namibia in between, and only reached the knockouts on goal difference as one of the best third-placed sides. The dissenting voices were deafening at that point; Bafana\u2019s early matches had been turgid, although Baxter points out that their preparation for this tournament verged on the disastrous, with funding issues seeing their schedule decimated and only one friendly, against Ghana, eventually being played. An already young, reconstructed squad arrived in Egypt badly undercooked and Baxter says their performance against the hosts, in which they obeyed his instructions to play an aggressive, attacking game to the letter, was the kind that banishes any weariness.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s basically why I\u2019ve hung in there, because the players have shown such an interest in wanting to be better, such a genuine pride in themselves when they get it right,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so loyal and patriotic that I\u2019ve always gone that extra mile.\u201d</p> <p>Baxter is used to doing that. His <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/mar/26/stuart-baxter-finland-wales\" title=\"\">story is well told</a> by now but a quick refresher course in his life and times underlines what a journey it has been. He has coached in eight countries, won titles in Sweden with AIK and South Africa with Kaizer Chiefs, bitten his lip when fired after two games in Turkey and contributed significantly to football\u2019s explosion in Japan. Were it not for the Midlands inflection \u2013 Baxter was born in Wolverhampton \u2013 it would feel like a chat with Roy Hodgson, as much for his urbanity and unaffected studiousness as for his winding road here. But unlike Hodgson he has never heard a loud clarion call from home, despite a few offers earlier in his career.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc9658443eb753aebf3540552b6cc29b71377822\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc9658443eb753aebf3540552b6cc29b71377822/0_54_4610_2867/1000.jpg\" alt=\"South Africa celebrate during their win over Egypt.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"622\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">South Africa celebrate during their win over Egypt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Shivambu/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAs it\u2019s moved forward there hasn\u2019t been the opportunity, and that\u2019s because I fall between two stools really,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not the exotic foreigner and I\u2019m not the big-name English knight in shining armour; I\u2019m neither the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/06/frank-lampard-dismisses-player-power-threat\" title=\"\">nor the Frank Lampard</a>, and the game in the Premier League has become about perception.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the alpha and omega of it, but it\u2019s why I\u2019m realistic to know I\u2019m not going to have a queue of people saying: \u2018He\u2019s won leagues all over the world and he\u2019s a Brit, let\u2019s bring him back.\u2019 I\u2019ve become a little, not exactly cynical, but non-expectant. When the phone rings it\u2019s from other places: I\u2019m exotic and attractive there but back home I\u2019m not.\u201d</p> <p>He fancies another crack at the Champions League, in which he competed with AIK, but feels confident in his capacity to set down roots anywhere in the world and describes himself as \u201cpretty easily transportable\u201d, moulding himself to the project at hand. \u201cI\u2019m not this instructor going round the world teaching football according to the theories of Stuart Baxter,\u201d he says. Perhaps there is an extent to which, in an era where philosophies and grand visions tend to seduce more than sheer practicality, that has held him back too.</p> <p>Not that there will be any sense of regret when South Africa walk back out at Cairo International Stadium, the venue stunned into dumbfounded silence by Thembinkosi Lorch\u2019s 85th-minute winner those few short days ago, to face Nigeria. \u201cWe have to do it as underdogs again,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are one of the best, but if we can put together a gameplan that gives them the problems we gave Egypt then we have a chance. At this stage it sometimes takes on its own life. The difference in the squad now, the belief they have, is absolutely night and day.\u201d Dawns like that are why, for all the brickbats and moments of doubt, Baxter comes back again and again.</p>",

Constantly.\u201d It is easier to answer that question during a week when, against all odds, Bafana Bafana have hauled themselves back among Africa\u2019s elite. Baxter calls South Africa \u201ca country of extremes\u201d and he should know, given that he is two years into his second spell managing the national team. On Saturday night the dial swung to paroxysms of euphoria as they outplayed Egypt, host country of the Africa Cup of Nations, in front of a baying home crowd and reached the last eight with a 1-0 win. For the 65-year-old Baxter, taking South Africa through to next Friday\u2019s final would be the pinnacle of a globetrotting career that has never been defined by his Anglo-Scottish upbringing. \u201cWinning this would be the biggest,\u201d he says, with Nigeria posing the next challenge in Wednesday\u2019s quarter-final. \u201cWithout sounding egotistical I think this would represent a massive personal victory for me, partly because it\u2019d be coming far more quickly than it should and partly because this is such a big tournament.\u201d It was 1996 when South Africa, only four years out of a lengthy Fifa suspension and still buoyant in the early stage of Nelson Mandela\u2019s presidency, won their first and only Cup of Nations. Baxter has brought Mark Fish, their defensive cornerstone back then, into his backroom staff to maintain a connection but he is at pains to point out that so much has changed since then. At that time Bafana Bafana, managed by Clive Barker, could ride the wave all the way home; these days they face a smothering pall of negativity that he believes places unrealistic demands on the sport\u2019s role. \u201cThe whole country was full of optimism in \u201996,\u201d he says. \u201cFull of hope and belief in the future. I think the team reflected that hope. When we beat Libya to qualify this time, the sports ministry wrote to me and said: \u2018You\u2019ve given the country hope\u2019, and for me that\u2019s where all this negativity stems from. \u201cIf the country is dependent on a result by the national team to give it hope, we fail. We can give it hope for five minutes, but every defeat is met with such negativity because on wider level those hopes and dreams have been flattened. There\u2019s too much going wrong in the country: getting the electricity shut down every day, the water shortages, the unemployment, you name it. The country\u2019s not hopeful and they\u2019re in a mental stage of depression; I think that gets reflected. They cannot accept any more negativity so one bad result is met by a tirade. \u201cWe can\u2019t give the country hope. We can\u2019t. Only temporarily. I\u2019m just happy we can give them a night off where they can wear the shirt proudly.\u201d South Africa lost to Ivory Coast and Morocco during the group stage, squeaking past lowly Namibia in between, and only reached the knockouts on goal difference as one of the best third-placed sides. The dissenting voices were deafening at that point; Bafana\u2019s early matches had been turgid, although Baxter points out that their preparation for this tournament verged on the disastrous, with funding issues seeing their schedule decimated and only one friendly, against Ghana, eventually being played. An already young, reconstructed squad arrived in Egypt badly undercooked and Baxter says their performance against the hosts, in which they obeyed his instructions to play an aggressive, attacking game to the letter, was the kind that banishes any weariness. \u201cThat\u2019s basically why I\u2019ve hung in there, because the players have shown such an interest in wanting to be better, such a genuine pride in themselves when they get it right,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve been so loyal and patriotic that I\u2019ve always gone that extra mile.\u201d Baxter is used to doing that. His story is well told by now but a quick refresher course in his life and times underlines what a journey it has been. He has coached in eight countries, won titles in Sweden with AIK and South Africa with Kaizer Chiefs, bitten his lip when fired after two games in Turkey and contributed significantly to football\u2019s explosion in Japan. Were it not for the Midlands inflection \u2013 Baxter was born in Wolverhampton \u2013 it would feel like a chat with Roy Hodgson, as much for his urbanity and unaffected studiousness as for his winding road here. But unlike Hodgson he has never heard a loud clarion call from home, despite a few offers earlier in his career. \u201cAs it\u2019s moved forward there hasn\u2019t been the opportunity, and that\u2019s because I fall between two stools really,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not the exotic foreigner and I\u2019m not the big-name English knight in shining armour; I\u2019m neither the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho nor the Frank Lampard, and the game in the Premier League has become about perception. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that\u2019s the alpha and omega of it, but it\u2019s why I\u2019m realistic to know I\u2019m not going to have a queue of people saying: \u2018He\u2019s won leagues all over the world and he\u2019s a Brit, let\u2019s bring him back.\u2019 I\u2019ve become a little, not exactly cynical, but non-expectant. When the phone rings it\u2019s from other places: I\u2019m exotic and attractive there but back home I\u2019m not.\u201d He fancies another crack at the Champions League, in which he competed with AIK, but feels confident in his capacity to set down roots anywhere in the world and describes himself as \u201cpretty easily transportable\u201d, moulding himself to the project at hand. \u201cI\u2019m not this instructor going round the world teaching football according to the theories of Stuart Baxter,\u201d he says. Perhaps there is an extent to which, in an era where philosophies and grand visions tend to seduce more than sheer practicality, that has held him back too. Not that there will be any sense of regret when South Africa walk back out at Cairo International Stadium, the venue stunned into dumbfounded silence by Thembinkosi Lorch\u2019s 85th-minute winner those few short days ago, to face Nigeria. \u201cWe have to do it as underdogs again,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are one of the best, but if we can put together a gameplan that gives them the problems we gave Egypt then we have a chance. At this stage it sometimes takes on its own life. The difference in the squad now, the belief they have, is absolutely night and day.\u201d Dawns like that are why, for all the brickbats and moments of doubt, Baxter comes back again and again.",

This week, a lawyer for Cottrell sought permission from the county court to take the case to a higher court for appeal, arguing that the conviction is at odds with Victoria\u2019s charter of human rights and responsibilities.

According to the report, nearly 40% of our leading cultural figures are from migrant or minority ethnic backgrounds. In other words, diversity is making an outsized contribution to British culture. And the size of the contribution is going up all the time: five years ago it was less than a third.</p> <p>Global Future\u2019s survey of 2,000 UK adults suggests nearly seven in 10 of us agree that diversity has improved our culture, against 15% who disagree.

We are united in our admiration for the acting of Idris Elba, the athleticism of Jessica Ennis-Hill and the artistry of Anish Kapoor and many more. It is essential that we remind ourselves of that fact, at a time when our politics seems geared towards making us forget it.</p> <p>We can \u2013 and should \u2013 always do more. There are still serious barriers to entry for people of a minority ethnic background into our major cultural industries. In some cases, exclusivity in the arts is increasing rather than decreasing. Our culture should be ours collectively, not reserved for a few \u2013 and we have to work tirelessly to make sure that is the case.</p> <p>But let\u2019s never lose sight of what makes Britain so special. Our differences fuel our creativity.

      "bodyText": "A couple of weeks ago, a young black man from south London stood up in front of tens of thousands of people and delivered one of the most celebrated performances in the history of Glastonbury. A few days later, an England cricket squad \u2013 almost half of whom were born abroad or are from an ethnic minority background \u2013 made it into the semi-finals of the World Cup. Meanwhile over at Tate Modern, a British artist of Nigerian origin is displaying an artwork made up of thousands of books imprinted with the names of migrants who have made significant contributions to British culture. Today, some of our most brilliant prospects in art and culture are from minority ethnic or migrant backgrounds. We present a gloriously multicultural face to the world. And that is important not just for the story we tell to others, but for the stories we tell ourselves. Think of the cultural power of the first Asian families on EastEnders, the breakthrough of Soul II Soul in the 1980s, or the nation-defining literary output of Zadie Smith. The British actor Riz Ahmed refers to this as \u201cstretching the flag, so it\u2019s big enough to embrace all of us\u201d. He is talking about how art can remould how we see ourselves and the country that we live in. The Pakistani-British heritage of his youth is just as much a part of our modern national story as the playing fields of Eton, remote Shetland communities or the multi-ethnic melting pots of Leicester, Birmingham and London. But it is only through the representation of that experience in our national culture that those truths are cemented across the whole country. We should be confident and proud about this story \u2013 yet it is too rarely told. Now a report from Global Future does exactly that, demonstrating not only the increasing diversity of our cultural industries, but how popular that diversity is. According to the report, nearly 40% of our leading cultural figures are from migrant or minority ethnic backgrounds. In other words, diversity is making an outsized contribution to British culture. And the size of the contribution is going up all the time: five years ago it was less than a third. Global Future\u2019s survey of 2,000 UK adults suggests nearly seven in 10 of us agree that diversity has improved our culture, against 15% who disagree. Food, music and sport are the cultural industries where people believe diversity has had the greatest impact. This is music to my ears, of course. Britain is my home. I was born here, I have lived my whole life here, and I have pursued my life\u2019s passion here. As a dancer, Britain has been my stage. It is our culture that makes me most proud to be British. That same culture has been a welcoming home for my own work: where a British dancer of Bangladeshi origin can pursue a career blending the Indian kathak style with contemporary forms. This openness to diversity is visible in many arenas: just look at the Notting Hill carnival every year. Or take the Turner prize, where the artists shortlisted in the last two years have been of German, Fijian, Israeli, Zanzibari, Palestinian, Jamaican and Bengali heritage. Diversity is what makes Britain\u2019s culture great. But recently it has felt as though we have lost sight of this self-evident truth. Brexit, polarisation and the poisonous debate about immigration threaten to turn our diversity into division. That would be a historic disaster for the country. And yet when it comes to our culture, we are not really divided at all. We are united in our admiration for the acting of Idris Elba, the athleticism of Jessica Ennis-Hill and the artistry of Anish Kapoor and many more. It is essential that we remind ourselves of that fact, at a time when our politics seems geared towards making us forget it. We can \u2013 and should \u2013 always do more. There are still serious barriers to entry for people of a minority ethnic background into our major cultural industries. In some cases, exclusivity in the arts is increasing rather than decreasing. Our culture should be ours collectively, not reserved for a few \u2013 and we have to work tirelessly to make sure that is the case. But let\u2019s never lose sight of what makes Britain so special. Our differences fuel our creativity. And our exposure to all the cultures of the world does nothing but improve our own. \u2022 Akram Khan is an award-winning British dancer and choreographer, and artistic director of the Akram Khan Company",

      "body": "<p>While <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/06/bryce-harper-manny-machado-free-agency\">other leagues</a> like to take their time when it comes to free agency, the NBA gets things done in a hurry. However, a few decisions took a while to develop, most notably Kawhi Leonard\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-kawhi-leonard-and-paul-georges-shock-decision-to-join-the-los-angeles-clippers-rocked-the-nba?ref=author\">league-shattering decision</a> to head to the Los Angeles Clippers after leading the Toronto Raptors to their first championship. Here are our attempts to see who fared the best after an eventful few weeks.</p> <h2>Winners</h2> <p><strong>1) Los Angeles Clippers</strong></p> <p>Did anybody see this coming? Late on Friday night, the Clippers pulled off a huge trade with the Oklahoma City Thunder to acquire Paul George, which ended up being the move they needed to convince Kawhi Leonard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/06/kawhi-leonard-paul-george-la-clippers-toronto-raptors-nba-free-agency\">to sign with them</a> after his brief stint in Toronto. Barely anybody was aware of the George trade until just after <a href=\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/bulls/ct-bulls-earthquake-zion-williamson-20190706-wzsjlohodvd7fpqkdu3q5qno7a-story.html\">an earthquake stopped games</a> in the Las Vegas summer league, because every metaphor has to be disgustingly on the nose in 2019 America.</p> <p>It was a fantastic deal for the Clippers, who added two legitimate MVP candidates to a team that had already managed to make a surprise playoff run last season with the none-too-shabby likes of Patrick Beverley, Lou Williams and Montrezl Harrell. Yes, the Clips had to <a href=\"https://www.theringer.com/nba/2019/7/6/20684206/paul-george-kawhi-leonard-clippers-free-agency-russell-westbrook\">give up a massive haul</a> that included five first-round draft picks alongside players Danilo Gallinari and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. But they can write that off as the price that needed to be paid in order to both get George from the Thunder and convince Leonard that they were a team worth joining. Now, they will enter next season as the hottest team in the NBA, and have one-upped that other team in Los Angeles shortly after they mortgaged all their assets for Anthony Davis.</p> <p><strong>2) Brooklyn Nets</strong></p> <p>This has been the offseason of the neglected younger brother. Right after the Los Angeles Lakers were overshadowed by the Clippers, the Nets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jul/01/kevin-durant-brooklyn-nets-free-agency-nba-new-york-knicks\">completely humiliated</a> the New York Knicks. Kyrie Irving changed teams once again, jilting the Boston Celtics by signing a four-year, $142m contract with Brooklyn. Much like with Leonard, Irving acted as something of a harbinger, bringing alongside him Kevin Durant, a player who eventually could turn the Nets into the best team in the East.</p> <p>\u201cEventually\u201d is the key word here as Durant will be out for a majority \u2013 or maybe even the entirety \u2013 of the 2019-20 season with an achilles injury. Still, the Nets are betting on Durant returning to his MVP form when he does return. In the meantime, Irving will get to enjoy running the entire show. The Nets will be dangerous even without Durant.</p> <p><strong>3) Philadelphia 76ers</strong></p> <p>For the second straight season, the Sixers have gone all-in. The Sixers lost Jimmy Butler, their major trade acquisition last season <a href=\"https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2019/06/30/philadelphia-76ers-sign-al-horford-acquire-josh-richardson-jimmy-butler-trade-miami-heat-free-agency/\">to the Miami Heat,</a> although they did manage to get back Josh Richardson in a sign-and-trade. They then went and offered big man Al Horford a four-year, $109m contract, adding him to a core that still features Joel Embiid, Ben Simmons and a re-signed Tobias Harris. The pieces didn\u2019t quite come together last year but replacing Butler with Horford could do wonders for their team chemistry.</p> <p><strong>4) Utah Jazz</strong></p> <p>While the teams in LA made the headline-grabbing moves, the Utah Jazz have very quietly gone through one of the most intriguing rebuilds in the Western Conference. After trading for the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Mike Conley, they signed Bojan Bogdanovic and then added Ed Davis to the mix. Call them<a href=\"https://www.sltrib.com/sports/2019/07/01/nba-writers-analysts-love/\"> the hipsters\u2019 choice</a> to emerge from the West.</p> <p><strong>5) NBA parity</strong></p> <p>Had Leonard gone to the Lakers instead of the Clippers, it\u2019s likely we would have seen another super-team form in the Western Conference right as the Warriors took a step backward. While plenty of big-name players have hooked up over the last week, they managed to distribute themselves across the NBA rather than all finding themselves on a single team. This means that unless there\u2019s some unforeseen moves yet to come, there will be <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/07/06/kawhi-leonard-clippers-lakers-nba-free-agency-paul-george-lebron-james?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=sinow&amp;xid=socialflow_twitter_si&amp;utm_medium=social\">no prohibitive favorites</a> in either conference next season. If LeBron James heading to the Lakers opened up the East last year, this offseason opened up the West and there are many realistic finals match-ups in play now. Over the last few years, it\u2019s felt like the league was becoming predictable and fans were starting to grow weary of the appearance of inevitability. It feels like we have pivoted away from that.</p> <h2>Losers</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd4f7d8e99853f5c9920f81efafb684a543a4338\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd4f7d8e99853f5c9920f81efafb684a543a4338/0_433_4760_2857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LeBron James and Anthony Davis are now teammates but the Lakers failed to build on the pair\u2019s new partnership.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LeBron James and Anthony Davis are now teammates but the Lakers failed to build on the pair\u2019s new partnership.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark J Rebilas/USA Today Sports</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1) Los Angeles Lakers</strong></p> <p>Let\u2019s make this clear: if we\u2019re talking about the offseason in general: the Lakers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/16/anthony-davis-trade-la-lakers-lebron-james-nba\">established themselves as winners</a> the second they traded for Anthony Davis. At this moment, however, we\u2019re looking at free agency. It\u2019s impossible to argue that losing out on Leonard didn\u2019t hurt the Lakers on several fronts. Not only did they miss out on putting together a super-team that would made them the clear finals favorites, they also waited so long for his decision they didn\u2019t have a chance to bid on the most desirable of the other free agents. While the Lakers did <a href=\"https://www.si.com/nba/2019/07/06/lakers-free-agency-rumors-danny-green-javale-mcgee-quinn-cook\">the best they could to move on</a>, it\u2019s not like either the dependable Danny Green or the surprisingly devalued DeMarcus Cousins are the kind of players who could be part of a Big Three. Plus, they put themselves in a position where they had to bring back Rajon Rondo and JaVale McGee to the circus in LA.</p> <p><strong>2) New York Knicks</strong></p> <p>The Knicks saved all that cap space with the hope of picking up two max contracts, only to see Irving and Durant head to that other New York team. They apparently <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2019/07/03/why-knicks-backed-out-of-kawhi-leonard-meeting/\">didn\u2019t even bother meeting with Leonard</a>, just rightfully assuming that he wanted no part of whatever is going on over there. Instead, they spent their money on [checks notes] uh, Julius Randle. The Lakers were merely temporarily embarrassed by the Leonard decision, the James Dolan-era Knicks are stuck in a perpetual nightmare of their own creation. It certainly would be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jan/31/kristaps-porzingis-new-york-knicks-dallas-mavericks-nba-trade\">nice to have Kristaps Porzingis</a> right now, wouldn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>3) Toronto Raptors</strong></p> <p>There\u2019s no way to second-guess the trade with the San Antonio Spurs that brought in Leonard at the cost of DeMar DeRozan. Leonard pretty much single-handedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/14/toronto-raptors-nba-championship-finals-golden-state-warriors\">brought Toronto a championship</a> and that will last forever. But, again, we\u2019re talking about free agency here and the Raptors were clearly in a pass/fail situation. They didn\u2019t have what it would have taken to convince Leonard to stay with them, he left for the Clippers and so their offseason went badly. Given how competitive the Eastern Conference stands to be next season, it\u2019s hard to see the suddenly starless Raptors pulling off a repeat championship next year. Oh well, they will always have 2019.</p> <p><strong>4) Golden State Warriors</strong></p> <p>Just in time for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/07/the-heart-is-here-why-the-warriors-success-is-more-bitter-than-sweet\">their move out of Oakland</a>, the Warriors dynasty is officially over. Kevin Durant left for the Nets, although Golden State wisely picked up D\u2019Angelo Russell as compensation. The Warriors <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/klay-thompson-free-agency-update-warriors-reach-five-year-190-million-max-deal-with-star-guard-per-report/\">re-signed Klay Thompson </a>to a five-year, $190m maximum contract, but they don\u2019t know when he\u2019ll fully be healthy due to the ACL injury he suffered in the finals. Andre Iguodala is heading to the Memphis Grizzlies. An era is officially over.</p> <p>Don\u2019t sleep on the Warriors, who could still win the championship next year. Steph Curry isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon. It\u2019s just that emerging from the West is going to be more difficult than it ever has been thanks to the improvements made by the Lakers, Clippers and Jazz not to mention the continuing presence of James Harden in Houston and the pesky Denver Nuggets. The Warriors haven\u2019t been this vulnerable since the last time they missed the finals back in 2014.</p> <p><strong>5) Charlotte Hornets</strong></p> <p>The Boston Celtics hoped to re-sign Kyrie Irving and Al Horford and possibly trade for Anthony Davis. None of that happened, but they did manage to lure Kemba Walker away from the Hornets and <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/sports/charlotte-hornets/article232320777.html\">get them to take Terry Rozier</a> off their hands in a sign-and-trade. And while we certainly can\u2019t give the Celtics a W for their offseason, we definitely can give the Hornets an L.</p> <p><strong>6) Russell Westbrook</strong></p> <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder did well by holding out for a king\u2019s ransom for Paul George once they realized they wouldn\u2019t be able to keep him. That said, it wasn\u2019t a good look for former teammate Russell Westbrook that George left, especially since it comes only a few years after Durant left to join the Warriors. Westbrook\u2019s been a league MVP but there\u2019s always been a question about whether he was a player you could win with. Certainly, the Thunder never managed to do it despite partnering him with some high-caliber players and now they may be looking <a href=\"https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/thunder-to-consider-trading-russell-westbrook-per-report-heat-among-three-teams-that-could-make-sense/\">to ship him off now</a> that a rebuild seems the next logical step. With $125m owed to him over the next three seasons, good luck finding a buyer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "At least 15 women and children have been killed in a massacre in Papua New Guinea\u2019s Hela province, in one of the worst outbreaks of tribal violence in the country for years. The killings happened on early Monday morning during a raid on Karida, a village of about 800 people in the interior of the country. Philip Pimua, the officer in charge of the Karida sub-health centre, who was in the village at the time of the attack, told the Guardian that there were 16 victims \u2013 eight children aged from one to 15 and eight women, two of whom were pregnant. RNZ reports that there were 15 victims \u2013 10 women and five children \u2013 citing Tari police spokesman Thomas Levongo who examined the scene at Karida. Levongo could not be reached for comment. Pimua said the attack happened at about 6am on Monday morning, with people killed after opening the door to attackers. \u201cI wake up in the morning, go to make a fire in my kitchen, at the same time I heard the sound of guns, then I saw some of the houses they were burning, so I knew that enemies are already inside the village,\u201d Pimua said. \u201cSo I just ran away and hide in the bush, then later on, about 9 or 10, I came back and saw bodies chopped into pieces and houses were burnt.\u201d As well as guns, bush knives were used in the attack. Pimua said he knew all the victims \u2013 \u201cthey are my people, I know them\u201d \u2013 but that some were so badly dismembered that he and other villagers struggled to identify the remains. \u201cThey were cut into pieces. Some had body parts we couldn\u2019t recognise which one is which one, only the faces we can recognise, but legs, hands\u2026\u201d Pimua said he and other villagers had wrapped the bodies in mosquito nets, and then fled the village, fearing that the attackers were still hiding in the bush and might strike again. He said they hoped to return to bury the bodies on Wednesday, but were waiting for police to come and escort them. Pimua said the attack was from \u201cenemies\u201d and may have been connected to tribal violence, saying \u201cthey have fought for a long time there\u201d. Hela province and other areas in the highlands of Papua New Guinea have been beset by tribal violence in recent years. There have been reports of killings, reprisals and sexual violence, all made worse with the increasing availability of firearms. PNG police told the Post Courier the attack followed an ambush attack on Saturday, which left six people dead. Asked if this was the worst attack his village had ever seen, Pimua said: \u201cIt\u2019s the worst, very worst, in the history of this country too.\u201d The attack occurred in the electorate of Papua New Guinea\u2019s new prime minister, James Marape, who described the day as \u201cone of the saddest\u201d of his life. In a Facebook post, Marape said the attack was led by gunmen from the Haguai, Okiru and Liwi tribes and said he would seek out and punish the perpetrators, using the \u201cstrongest measures in law\u201d. \u201cIn memory of the innocent who continue to die at the hands of gun-toting criminals, your time is up, before I had someone else to report to, now I have no one else to report to but the innocent you kill,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo all who have guns and kill and hide behind the mask of community, learn from what I will do to criminals who killed innocent people \u2026 I am coming for you.\u201d Marape also blamed insufficient police resources in the region, saying he had been asking for more permanent police to be stationed in the area since 2012, but had not had any support. \u201cHow can a province of 400,000 people function with policing law and order with under 60 policemen?\u201d Marape wrote. Pimua was doubtful about the likelihood that those responsible for the attack would be caught. \u201cIf prime minister use special forces from some other countries to come and find these people then he can do it, OK, but for our security forces, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he said. The ICRC Papua New Guinea head of mission, Ahmad Hallak, said: \u201cWe are very concerned by reports that women and children have been killed and urge all sides to refrain from targeting anyone who is not directly engaged in the fighting. \u201cWe are monitoring the situation closely and are in touch with our contacts in the area.

      "bodyText": "Airbus is on track to overtake Boeing as the world\u2019s biggest planemaker as the US company reported a slump in deliveries of new commercial jet airliner deliveries after two fatal crashes involving the 737 Max. Boeing, which has led its European rival since 2012, is struggling after safety regulators worldwide grounded its best-selling 737 Max following the Ethiopian Airlines and Lion Air disasters that killed 346 people. Boeing reported 239 commercial plane deliveries in the first half of the year, a 37% fall from 378 in the same period last year, highlighting the extent to which the crashes have damaged its reputation in the market. Rival Airbus has reported 389 deliveries in the first half, up 28% on the same period last year, and is on track to deliver a record number of planes this year, overtaking Boeing for the first time in seven years. Before the crash, Boeing was delivering planes at a rate of 50 a month in the first quarter. Output has since slumped to only 30 a month in the second quarter. Boeing halted deliveries of the top-selling plane since it was grounded in mid-March. There are more than 150 undelivered Max planes parked at sites around the US as well as 380 owned by airlines that remain grounded. June was the third month running that Boeing booked no new orders of its Max aircraft. Air regulators are not expected to clear the model to fly again before the end of September as the company continues to work on fixing the aircraft\u2019s flight-control systems. Airbus has been ramping up the pressure on Boeing by pushing its best-selling A320neo, a direct rival to the Max, and publicly announcing an increase in production. This week Boeing lost a provisional deal for 50 737 Max planes from flyadeal, the budget arm of Saudi Arabian Airlines, which instead ordered the Airbus rival. The deal, with a value of more than $5.5bn (\u00a34.4bn), is one of the first direct signs that the Max crashes have resulted in business shifting to Boeing\u2019s rival. However, last month at the Paris air show Boeing was given a shot in the arm when International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways, signed a \u201cletter of intent\u201d to buy 200 Boeing 737 Max aircraft in the first new sales deal for the passenger jet since it was grounded. The IAG order is yet to be officially booked by Boeing.",

Octavia, the self-anointed \u201cDaughter of God\u201d, teaches her followers that the secrets of salvation were sealed in a box 100 years ago by a mysterious English prophetess. Her followers must pray for it to be opened while purging themselves of sin, doubt and bad table manners. \u201cJesus will not return until we make ourselves colourless, faultless, zero,\u201d she tells them, pointing out that the Almighty takes an especially dim view of \u201cunnecessary noises, high voices\u201d and putting \u201cyour knife and fork at right angles to the plate\u201d.</p> <p>Octavia is a wonderfully original character: prim, dowdy and genuinely sinister, as though Hyacinth Bucket had been written into <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/rosemarys-baby-polanksi-horror\" title=\"\">Rosemary\u2019s Baby</a></em>.

In an attempt to win Octavia\u2019s favour, Dilys makes a new recruit of another young woman, Grace, a legal secretary with burning auburn hair. Grace\u2019s smile makes Dilys feel as though \u201cGod Himself has finally noticed I am here\u201d, and she soon finds herself torn between the spirit and the flesh, afflicted by \u201cvisions that rise in my breath while I sleep \u2026 dreams trapped in the fringing on the pink lampshade or clinging to the mirror like a smear of grease\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/19/top-10-books-about-cults-claire-mcglasson-margaret-atwood-harukil-murakami\">Top 10 books about cults | Claire McGlasson</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>The Rapture</em> is perceptive about the ways in which earthly longing can be refracted into religious excitement, as a magnifying glass focuses sunlight. The Society helps channel and tame its members\u2019 sexual passion, their grief over husbands and brothers lost in the war, and their unarticulated political frustration (first-wave feminism has barely made a splash in their lives).

      "bodyText": "Fiction, like religion, asks us to believe in things we cannot see. Claire McGlasson\u2019s debut novel tells a story so strange and improbable that it might have tested the faith of some readers \u2013 if not for the fact that it is firmly grounded in historical events. A TV reporter by trade, McGlasson has uncovered the little-known tale of the Panacea Society, a group of genteel single ladies who gathered in Bedford in the years after the first world war to await the second coming while surrounded by tasteful upholstery. If this all sounds benignly dotty, we soon learn that behind the Society\u2019s viburnum hedges and lace curtains lurks a dangerous personality cult. Octavia, the self-anointed \u201cDaughter of God\u201d, teaches her followers that the secrets of salvation were sealed in a box 100 years ago by a mysterious English prophetess. Her followers must pray for it to be opened while purging themselves of sin, doubt and bad table manners. \u201cJesus will not return until we make ourselves colourless, faultless, zero,\u201d she tells them, pointing out that the Almighty takes an especially dim view of \u201cunnecessary noises, high voices\u201d and putting \u201cyour knife and fork at right angles to the plate\u201d. Octavia is a wonderfully original character: prim, dowdy and genuinely sinister, as though Hyacinth Bucket had been written into Rosemary\u2019s Baby. But the novel\u2019s beating heart is the story of 25-year-old Dilys. In an attempt to win Octavia\u2019s favour, Dilys makes a new recruit of another young woman, Grace, a legal secretary with burning auburn hair. Grace\u2019s smile makes Dilys feel as though \u201cGod Himself has finally noticed I am here\u201d, and she soon finds herself torn between the spirit and the flesh, afflicted by \u201cvisions that rise in my breath while I sleep \u2026 dreams trapped in the fringing on the pink lampshade or clinging to the mirror like a smear of grease\u201d. The Rapture is perceptive about the ways in which earthly longing can be refracted into religious excitement, as a magnifying glass focuses sunlight. The Society helps channel and tame its members\u2019 sexual passion, their grief over husbands and brothers lost in the war, and their unarticulated political frustration (first-wave feminism has barely made a splash in their lives). McGlasson weaves these threads together skilfully, creating a wise and entertaining novel about the way we break open the boxes sealed inside ourselves. \u2022 The Rapture is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).

      "bodyText": "Heineken\u2019s pub chain is to be investigated over claims it imposed unfair terms on publicans who tried to cut the \u201cbeer tie\u201d, a centuries-old arrangement under which they must buy beer from the owner of their premises. The Pubs Code Adjudicator, which has been criticised for a supine attitude towards deep-pocketed pub companies, has launched its first investigation, examining the behaviour of the Heineken-owned Star Pubs &amp; Bars. The deputy adjudicator Fiona Dickie said Star\u2019s alleged business practices may have disadvantaged publicans and could have raised the price of a pint for consumers. If the PCA finds against Heineken, the Dutch beer group could be fined up to 1% of UK turnover \u2013 about \u00a311m, based on Companies House filings by Heineken UK. Dickie warned other pub companies that more investigations could follow. There have been widespread allegations by publicans that pub companies are doing everything possible to prevent them escaping the beer tie. The PCA will look at whether Star, which has 2,700 pubs, tried to impose unfair terms when tenants applied for a \u201cmarket rent only\u201d [MRO] option, an arrangement designed to help them sever the beer tie but which critics say is ineffective and often has strings attached. Publicans who rent from Star will be asked whether the company tried to force them to stock only Heineken keg beer, or an unreasonable volume of its brands or other drinks in which it has a financial interest. Of the 111 MRO offers that Star has made to tenants looking to cut the tie, 40 have gone to arbitration. More applicants are thought to have given up on the process rather than dispute the terms the pub company offered them. Dickie said: \u201cIt is important that Star tenants and other interested parties provide us with information to support this investigation. Their information will help us to determine whether the pubs code has been broken and, if so, what further action should be taken.\u201d The investigation will cover the period since the introduction in 2016 of the pubs code, which regulates companies with more than 500 establishments, including Admiral Taverns, Ei Group (formerly Enterprise Inns), Greene King, Marston\u2019s and Punch Taverns. The code, currently the subject of a government review of its effectiveness, is meant to ensure \u201cfair and lawful dealing\u201d by major pub companies and that landlords are not worse off than they would be if they were free of the beer tie. The MRO section of the code is intended to provide a system under which landlords can escape the tie by negotiating a new agreement with their pub company, with the PCA overseeing an arbitration process. Publicans have frequently criticised the MRO option for being ineffective and costly, while the PCA has come under fire for not doing enough to uphold its integrity. Any landlords who submit evidence have until 5 August and will not be identified in the final report. A Star spokesperson said: \u201cThe legislation is clear that as a brewer we have the right to ensure that the pubs we own sell our beer and cider. This reflects the significant ongoing investment we make and the jobs we support in our UK breweries, cideries and supply chain. \u201cWhile the principle of the brewers stocking requirement is clear, this part of the new legislation is complex and not clearly defined in the pubs code. We therefore hope that this investigation will provide the certainty and clarity that we have sought repeatedly over the past three years.

      "bodyText": "Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt escalated the blue-on-blue warfare in Tuesday night\u2019s televised debate, trading blows on which potential prime minister could see through a no-deal Brexit, as Hunt repeatedly emphasised his rival\u2019s refusal to answer questions. The bitter back-and-forth, which will raise questions over whether Hunt could serve in a Johnson government after the aspersions he cast on his rival, saw the foreign secretary accuse Johnson of putting personal ambition above the welfare of the country. In the hour-long ITV broadcast, Johnson swerved questions repeatedly on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and declined to condemn Donald Trump for his attacks on the British ambassador. Johnson also gave equivocal answers on issues including HS2, Heathrow\u2019s third runway, and abortion and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. Johnson said that committing to resign if he fell short of his Brexit promise would play into the hands of the EU, and he also refused to rule out proroguing parliament to deliver no deal, calling it \u201cabsolutely bizarre\u201d to take the option off the table. Hunt said such a scenario could potentially lead to civil unrest. \u201cWhen parliament has been shut down against its will, we\u2019ve actually had a civil war \u2026 my answer to that is no,\u201d he said. In a number of pointed attacks in the first head-to-head debate of the Conservative leadership race, Hunt suggested the EU would not negotiate with someone who had \u201cgratuitously insulted them\u201d and repeatedly challenged Johnson to resign if he did not deliver Brexit by 31 October. In turn, Johnson repeatedly called Hunt \u201ca defeatist\u201d, hinted the country had had enough of a \u201cmanagerial style\u201d and called his rival \u201ca stickler for detail \u2026 and you tend to go on about it\u201d. Johnson, widely tipped as the frontrunner in the race, at one point suggested he was uncomfortable with the tone of the debate. \u201cThis is one of the reasons these blue-on-blue debates are so embarrassing,\u2019\u201d he said. Hunt repeatedly stressed Johnson\u2019s unwillingness to commit on detail. \u201cYou have not answered any of my questions. Not one,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause Boris never answers the question, we have no idea what a Boris Johnson premiership would be like.\u201d The roughest exchanges came as the two men clashed over the prospect of leaving the EU on 31 October, deal or no deal.

I don\u2019t want to hold out any prospect to the EU that they might encourage my resignation.\u201d Hunt suggested that it was \u201cBoris in No 10\u201d that was the priority for Johnson. \u201cI asked Boris a straight question and he said very clearly before that it was leaving on 31 October do or die,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s do or die for the country \u2013 but not a prime minister who would put his own neck on the line \u2013 and that is not leadership.\u201d In turn, Johnson repeatedly mocked his opponent for failing to give a firm exit date after Hunt said he believed a hard exit date increased the risk of a general election. \u201cWhen is the deadline?

Other areas where the two men clashed included Johnson\u2019s proposed tax cuts for workers earning between \u00a350,000 and \u00a380,000, his first pledge of the campaign. Though Johnson insisted those would be \u201cpart of the package\u201d which would include measures for those on low incomes, Hunt said it was tarnishing the image of the party. \u201cI have spent my life trying to convince people we are not the party of the rich, we are the party of everyone, and if the very first tax cut you announce is a tax cut for the rich, that is the wrong signal to send about our party,\u201d he said.

The ITV debate \u2013 the only head-to-head in the campaign \u2013 came after ballot papers had already been distributed to Tory party members, raising questions as to whether anything in the debate would influence how members will vote. Sources close to Hunt said they did not believe the debate would be an irrelevance and that anecdotal evidence from local associations suggested many were still undecided. In the Johnson camp, there was little concern as to whether their candidate had swerved too many questions. \u201cThe whole frame of this contest is about Brexit and when we are going to leave and that is the one thing where Hunt is refusing to answer.

His publicist, Rick Miramontez, confirmed Torn died Tuesday afternoon at his home with his wife, actor Amy Wright, and daughters Katie Torn and Angelica Page by his side. No cause of death was given. </p> <p>Torn, who had been a constant presence on stage and screen since the mid-1950s, was arguably better known for his eccentric, and occasionally violent, antics when the cameras weren\u2019t rolling \u2013 and on one notorious occasion, when they were. During the filming of Norman Mailer\u2019s film Maidstone, a largely improvised production made at the height of the late-60s counterculture, Torn played Mailer\u2019s brother, and attacked Mailer for real, hitting him over the head with a hammer and then attempting to strangle him. Mailer responded by biting Torn\u2019s ear.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/jul/10/rip-torn-dies-obituary-dennis-hopper-norman-mailer-larry-sanders\">Rip Torn: a wild man of stage and screen and a titan of US TV comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Torn\u2019s reputation for irascibility had already been established inside the industry after a row with Dennis Hopper during the pre-production of Easy Rider, the seminal 1969 counterculture biker movie, that led to Torn being replaced by Jack Nicholson before shooting began. The incident became more widely known after Hopper claimed on a TV talkshow in 1994 that Torn had pulled a knife on him; Torn subsequently sued, claiming that Hopper had in fact pulled the knife on him. <a href=\"http://variety.com/1998/film/news/appeals-court-upholds-judgment-vs-hopper-1117469436/\">The court found in Torn\u2019s favour</a>, and awarded him $475,000 in damages.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AzmhorISf4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6AzmhorISf4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>By the time of Easy Rider, however, Torn was already an established figure in Hollywood. Born in Texas in 1931, the son of an agricultural economist, Torn\u2019s given names were Elmore Rual, with \u201cRip\u201d being a traditional nickname within his family. (His mother\u2019s maiden name was Spacek; his cousin is Carrie star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/mar/19/sissy-spacek-bloodline-interview-fearless\">Sissy Spacek</a>.) Torn studied drama at the University of Texas, before relocating to New York and the Actors Studio, the celebrated training ground for the \u201cmethod\u201d generation. There he fell in with the circle around director <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/elia-kazan-martin-scorsese\">Elia Kazan</a>, who gave Torn his first film part (in 1956\u2019s Baby Doll) and his first substantial stage role, in the original 1959 production of Sweet Bird of Youth (as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nybbP_21wes\">the 1962 film adaptation</a>, directed by Richard Brooks).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7605da34dd86f41cf54d52c80c584642e83489f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7605da34dd86f41cf54d52c80c584642e83489f1/0_0_3200_2173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rip Torn with future wife Geraldine Page in the film version of The Sweet Bird of Youth.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rip Torn with future wife Geraldine Page in the film version of The Sweet Bird of Youth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Torn\u2019s career gained momentum during the 1960s: he played Judas Iscariot in the Nicholas Ray-directed King of Kings, as wealthy gambler Slade in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/03/news\">The Cincinnati Kid</a>, and appeared in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s second film as director, You\u2019re a Big Boy Now, in 1966. His stage career flourished at the same time, and reflected his burgeoning interest in radical politics: he appeared in James Baldwin\u2019s 1964 play, Blues for Mr Charlie, based on <a href=\"http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/the-death-of-emmett-till\">the murder of Emmett Till</a> \u2013 though he later fell out with Baldwin, after the writer softened some of the play\u2019s controversial scenes after it transferred to London\u2019s West End.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1148810903497822208\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rip Torn always made me laugh.

Torn later claimed it had damaged his career, and it\u2019s certainly the case that he did not progress in the 1970s and 80s in the way he might have expected. He played a mobster in the 1972 blaxploitation Slaughter, and an industrialist in the 1976 oddball sci-fi film The Man Who Fell to Earth (opposite David Bowie); he received an unexpected best supporting actor Oscar nomination in 1983 for the lyrical 1920s-set author memoir Cross Creek. He also made a disastrous directorial debut with the 1988 Whoopi Goldberg comedy The Telephone; Torn found it difficult to deal with Goldberg\u2019s improvisatory style and the pair clashed repeatedly.

      "bodyText": "Rip Torn, America\u2019s celebrated wildman actor, has died aged 88. His publicist, Rick Miramontez, confirmed Torn died Tuesday afternoon at his home with his wife, actor Amy Wright, and daughters Katie Torn and Angelica Page by his side. No cause of death was given. Torn, who had been a constant presence on stage and screen since the mid-1950s, was arguably better known for his eccentric, and occasionally violent, antics when the cameras weren\u2019t rolling \u2013 and on one notorious occasion, when they were. During the filming of Norman Mailer\u2019s film Maidstone, a largely improvised production made at the height of the late-60s counterculture, Torn played Mailer\u2019s brother, and attacked Mailer for real, hitting him over the head with a hammer and then attempting to strangle him. Mailer responded by biting Torn\u2019s ear. Torn\u2019s reputation for irascibility had already been established inside the industry after a row with Dennis Hopper during the pre-production of Easy Rider, the seminal 1969 counterculture biker movie, that led to Torn being replaced by Jack Nicholson before shooting began. The incident became more widely known after Hopper claimed on a TV talkshow in 1994 that Torn had pulled a knife on him; Torn subsequently sued, claiming that Hopper had in fact pulled the knife on him. The court found in Torn\u2019s favour, and awarded him $475,000 in damages. By the time of Easy Rider, however, Torn was already an established figure in Hollywood. Born in Texas in 1931, the son of an agricultural economist, Torn\u2019s given names were Elmore Rual, with \u201cRip\u201d being a traditional nickname within his family. (His mother\u2019s maiden name was Spacek; his cousin is Carrie star Sissy Spacek.) Torn studied drama at the University of Texas, before relocating to New York and the Actors Studio, the celebrated training ground for the \u201cmethod\u201d generation. There he fell in with the circle around director Elia Kazan, who gave Torn his first film part (in 1956\u2019s Baby Doll) and his first substantial stage role, in the original 1959 production of Sweet Bird of Youth (as well as the 1962 film adaptation, directed by Richard Brooks). Torn\u2019s career gained momentum during the 1960s: he played Judas Iscariot in the Nicholas Ray-directed King of Kings, as wealthy gambler Slade in The Cincinnati Kid, and appeared in Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s second film as director, You\u2019re a Big Boy Now, in 1966. His stage career flourished at the same time, and reflected his burgeoning interest in radical politics: he appeared in James Baldwin\u2019s 1964 play, Blues for Mr Charlie, based on the murder of Emmett Till \u2013 though he later fell out with Baldwin, after the writer softened some of the play\u2019s controversial scenes after it transferred to London\u2019s West End. It was Torn\u2019s friendship with writer and fellow Texan Terry Southern (the pair met on Cincinnati Kid) that led to the Easy Rider debacle: Southern had written the role of lawyer George Hanson for Torn, but after the altercation with Hopper it went to Nicholson. Torn later claimed it had damaged his career, and it\u2019s certainly the case that he did not progress in the 1970s and 80s in the way he might have expected. He played a mobster in the 1972 blaxploitation Slaughter, and an industrialist in the 1976 oddball sci-fi film The Man Who Fell to Earth (opposite David Bowie); he received an unexpected best supporting actor Oscar nomination in 1983 for the lyrical 1920s-set author memoir Cross Creek. He also made a disastrous directorial debut with the 1988 Whoopi Goldberg comedy The Telephone; Torn found it difficult to deal with Goldberg\u2019s improvisatory style and the pair clashed repeatedly. Otherwise, much of his time was spent becalmed in run-of-the-mill crime and horror. However, Torn experienced a dramatic career upturn after being cast as Machiavellian, foulmouthed talk-show producer Artie in The Larry Sanders Show, after the producers were impressed by his turn as a lawyer in the Albert Brooks afterlife comedy Defending Your Life. The show ran from 1992 to 1998, and Torn was nominated for an Emmy for each of its six seasons: he only won once, in 1996. As a result, he began appearing in higher-profile films: notably as Agent Z in the blockbuster sci-fi comedy Men in Black in 1997, and the literary comedy-drama Wonder Boys in 2000. Torn worked constantly in the next decade, appearing in everything from broad comedies such as Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story and Freddy Got Fingered, to high-status period drama such as Sofia Coppola\u2019s Marie Antoinette. He also had a recurring role in the TV industry satire 30 Rock as network chief Don Geiss. However Torn\u2019s reputation for volatility returned when he was arrested in 2010 for breaking into a Connecticut bank at night while carrying a loaded gun. Reports at the time suggested that a highly intoxicated Torn thought the bank was his home, and that he had fallen asleep inside the building. This followed a series of arrests for drink-driving, dating back to 2004. Torn was married three times, all to fellow actors: Ann Wedgeworth (between 1956 and their divorce in 1961); Geraldine Page, who he met when they worked together on Sweet Bird of Youth (between 1963 and her death in 1987), and Amy Wright, who survives him after their marriage in 1989.

      "body": "<p>It is one of the cliches of parenthood that the behaviour which comes most easily (a reproving tone of voice, say, or an attitude to your child\u2019s tears) reflects what your parents did with you. It takes a while to realise that what feels like instinct is often an inheritance, that just because something comes \u201cnaturally\u201d it is not necessarily constructive. It may get in the way, first, of the relationship between parent and child, and then, because this relationship provides the foundation for all future relationships, of how the child will get on in the world.</p> <p>Enter Philippa Perry\u2019s book, which has an inspired title (even if one commenter on Mumsnet argued it veers a little close to clickbait). Perry has a plan \u201cfor parents who not only love their children but want to like them too\u201d. Except it isn\u2019t really a plan, as such: more of an attitude, a way of being, a set of assumptions. Children are not problems to be fixed or projects at which to excel, but individuals to be understood and supported, in a mutually respectful relationship. Their feelings, however inconvenient, must be heard and validated (which is very different from being agreed with), because if they aren\u2019t they will find other, even less desirable ways of expressing themselves, if not at the time then later in life. Perry understands how necessary it is to examine our reactions to these small individuals, and to determine whether what we are reacting to, when we become angry or distressed, is their behaviour, or something childlike in ourselves.</p> <p>Perry is a psychotherapist and agony aunt who has spent 20 years, as she puts it, \u201cmirroring and validating\u201d to get people \u201cback on track. If parents could do this from the off, surely I could give up being a psychotherapist \u2013 and arrange flowers instead.\u201d She is also the parent of a daughter, Flo (who, she reveals in one of the rare personal passages, was born with the umbilical cord wrapped three times around her neck \u2013 it was years before Perry could talk about it calmly). The book is anchored in tiny parenting triumphs \u2013 getting home with the shopping without being derailed by a tantrum, for example \u2013 and an understanding that mistakes are inevitable: what matters is what you then do about them. It is like a letter from a wise friend who happens to have done years of research, and \u2013 in this culture that will teach you how to take a good selfie but not how to nurture a healthy relationship \u2013 can feel like water on a parched plain. Which is perhaps one of the reasons it has spent months on the bestseller list.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e295cd0f9ddd63d2cd58cd3d77b8cd896fb79746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e295cd0f9ddd63d2cd58cd3d77b8cd896fb79746/0_294_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"naughty step\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Children are not problems to be fixed\u2019 \u2026 a trip to the naughty step.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elva Etienne/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Perry begins at the beginning \u2013 before the beginning in fact, with the atmosphere that shapes the parent and will in turn shape what a foetus will hear and feel and then, once born, encounter. She is vivid about the spectrum of what she calls desertion, imagining it literally, as a desert where a baby cries out for food and water and attention, which is \u201cnot a want but a need\u201d. Do parents come when called, or do they believe in leaving a baby to cry, which will eventually silence the cries but will not answer the need? Do they push an older child away with lack of interest, or with contentless praise? Because when a child shows you their painting, they are showing you \u201cwho they really are\u201d. Do they dismiss complex feelings as \u201cjust tired\u201d or \u201cjust hungry\u201d, or \u201cjust seeking attention\u201d, creating the deep loneliness in the child of not being seen or heard or felt? This is likely to create adults who \u201cfeel real only when they have a direct behavioural or emotional impact on those around them\u201d. Did the parent inherit an \u201cinner critic\u201d, which is now emerging in a different generation?</p> <p>Or is this a place where behaviour is understood as one of many languages, where strong feelings are heard and contained by adults, thus building a deep trust? Such behaviour will also create a default mood for life \u2013 as Perry puts it, a vitally necessary \u201chabit of optimism\u201d, which is not the same as happiness, the expectation and chasing of which she sees as a kind of tyranny. Perry quotes Adam Phillips \u2013 \u201cthe demand that we be happy undermines our lives\u201d \u2013 and makes an argument for something far more nourishing: a life of connection, of give and take and light and shade and emotional resilience. Of true confidence versus surface bravura. This is the job of parenting \u2013 not the chasing of outward success or surface polish or obedience.</p> <p>In a comment on a recent piece about the bestselling author Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, whose book <em>Hold on to Your Kids</em> argues that parents need to matter more to children than their peers do, a reader accused him of being selfish. But he, like Steve Biddulph, author of the bestselling <em>Raising Boys</em>, and now Perry, argues that what is at stake is not just personal closeness, lovely as that might be, but nothing less than the child\u2019s physical and emotional safety. As Perry puts it, baldly: \u201cYou want to be the person your child can talk to. If you tell them they are silly to complain when granny made them a nice lentil stew, they may feel they can\u2019t tell you when the creepy piano teacher puts his hand on their leg.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Perry includes bits of rough poetry: to sing with a child is to 'breathe and play together'</p> </blockquote> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/10/philippa-perry-interview-listen-carefully-parents-and-dont-despair\">Philippa Perry: \u2018Listen carefully, parents \u2013 and don\u2019t despair\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perry is generous and accepting but has clear boundaries. She is severe about distraction as a tool, for instance \u2013 what she calls the \u201clook, squirrel\u201d syndrome, when a child tells you an important thing and you can\u2019t work out what to say, so you change the subject. Using distraction is manipulative, insulting to a child\u2019s intelligence, and teaches them not to concentrate. She disapproves entirely of sleep-training, and of parents habitually using their phones and other screens in a child\u2019s presence \u2013 \u201cnot only will you be depriving them of contact, you will be creating an empty space inside them. And not to be dramatic, but this is the sort of empty space that may make addicts of people later in life.\u201d She is fascinating about lying (adults should not do it, but children will, and we must not make a big deal of it).</p> <p>The book provides useful case histories and some eye-opening facts: the \u201cbreast-crawl\u201d, for instance (the ability of a newborn to find its mother\u2019s breast all on its own); and the realisation that more summer-born children are diagnosed with ADHD than those born in September. And Perry includes bits of rough poetry: to sing with a child is to \u201cbreathe and play together\u201d; \u201cno one likes to be left to dance alone, even if it is a dance of war\u201d. On the other hand, in her book everyone seems to have a European name and background; also, she makes few allowances for having more than one child; and she doesn\u2019t, as Melissa Benn has noted, give quite enough air to families under great social, emotional and physical stress \u2013 though I suspect Perry would argue that quality of attention must be aimed for regardless. </p> <p>It is hard to read fast, not just because Perry\u2019s text is punctuated by exercises \u2013 unpack the last argument you had, for instance, or write down all your self-critical thoughts for a day \u2013 but because it prompts so many realisations, or insights, or clearly names things that have until now existed just beyond one\u2019s awareness. And it provides tools, straightforward and manageable if not always easy, that can be implemented at once.

If parents could do this from the off, surely I could give up being a psychotherapist \u2013 and arrange flowers instead.\u201d She is also the parent of a daughter, Flo (who, she reveals in one of the rare personal passages, was born with the umbilical cord wrapped three times around her neck \u2013 it was years before Perry could talk about it calmly). The book is anchored in tiny parenting triumphs \u2013 getting home with the shopping without being derailed by a tantrum, for example \u2013 and an understanding that mistakes are inevitable: what matters is what you then do about them. It is like a letter from a wise friend who happens to have done years of research, and \u2013 in this culture that will teach you how to take a good selfie but not how to nurture a healthy relationship \u2013 can feel like water on a parched plain. Which is perhaps one of the reasons it has spent months on the bestseller list. Perry begins at the beginning \u2013 before the beginning in fact, with the atmosphere that shapes the parent and will in turn shape what a foetus will hear and feel and then, once born, encounter. She is vivid about the spectrum of what she calls desertion, imagining it literally, as a desert where a baby cries out for food and water and attention, which is \u201cnot a want but a need\u201d. Do parents come when called, or do they believe in leaving a baby to cry, which will eventually silence the cries but will not answer the need? Do they push an older child away with lack of interest, or with contentless praise? Because when a child shows you their painting, they are showing you \u201cwho they really are\u201d. Do they dismiss complex feelings as \u201cjust tired\u201d or \u201cjust hungry\u201d, or \u201cjust seeking attention\u201d, creating the deep loneliness in the child of not being seen or heard or felt? This is likely to create adults who \u201cfeel real only when they have a direct behavioural or emotional impact on those around them\u201d. Did the parent inherit an \u201cinner critic\u201d, which is now emerging in a different generation? Or is this a place where behaviour is understood as one of many languages, where strong feelings are heard and contained by adults, thus building a deep trust? Such behaviour will also create a default mood for life \u2013 as Perry puts it, a vitally necessary \u201chabit of optimism\u201d, which is not the same as happiness, the expectation and chasing of which she sees as a kind of tyranny. Perry quotes Adam Phillips \u2013 \u201cthe demand that we be happy undermines our lives\u201d \u2013 and makes an argument for something far more nourishing: a life of connection, of give and take and light and shade and emotional resilience. Of true confidence versus surface bravura. This is the job of parenting \u2013 not the chasing of outward success or surface polish or obedience. In a comment on a recent piece about the bestselling author Dr Gabor Mat\u00e9, whose book Hold on to Your Kids argues that parents need to matter more to children than their peers do, a reader accused him of being selfish. But he, like Steve Biddulph, author of the bestselling Raising Boys, and now Perry, argues that what is at stake is not just personal closeness, lovely as that might be, but nothing less than the child\u2019s physical and emotional safety. As Perry puts it, baldly: \u201cYou want to be the person your child can talk to. If you tell them they are silly to complain when granny made them a nice lentil stew, they may feel they can\u2019t tell you when the creepy piano teacher puts his hand on their leg.\u201d Perry is generous and accepting but has clear boundaries. She is severe about distraction as a tool, for instance \u2013 what she calls the \u201clook, squirrel\u201d syndrome, when a child tells you an important thing and you can\u2019t work out what to say, so you change the subject. Using distraction is manipulative, insulting to a child\u2019s intelligence, and teaches them not to concentrate. She disapproves entirely of sleep-training, and of parents habitually using their phones and other screens in a child\u2019s presence \u2013 \u201cnot only will you be depriving them of contact, you will be creating an empty space inside them. And not to be dramatic, but this is the sort of empty space that may make addicts of people later in life.\u201d She is fascinating about lying (adults should not do it, but children will, and we must not make a big deal of it). The book provides useful case histories and some eye-opening facts: the \u201cbreast-crawl\u201d, for instance (the ability of a newborn to find its mother\u2019s breast all on its own); and the realisation that more summer-born children are diagnosed with ADHD than those born in September. And Perry includes bits of rough poetry: to sing with a child is to \u201cbreathe and play together\u201d; \u201cno one likes to be left to dance alone, even if it is a dance of war\u201d. On the other hand, in her book everyone seems to have a European name and background; also, she makes few allowances for having more than one child; and she doesn\u2019t, as Melissa Benn has noted, give quite enough air to families under great social, emotional and physical stress \u2013 though I suspect Perry would argue that quality of attention must be aimed for regardless. It is hard to read fast, not just because Perry\u2019s text is punctuated by exercises \u2013 unpack the last argument you had, for instance, or write down all your self-critical thoughts for a day \u2013 but because it prompts so many realisations, or insights, or clearly names things that have until now existed just beyond one\u2019s awareness. And it provides tools, straightforward and manageable if not always easy, that can be implemented at once. I am grateful for it. \u2022 The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read is published by Penguin Life (\u00a312.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 0330 333 6846.

      "bodyText": "In contrast to many congregations in western Europe, attendance is on the up at Notre-Dame aux Riches Claires, an imposing baroque red-brick church on a cobbled road close to Brussels\u2019 Grand Place. The faithful squeeze into the pews for Sunday mass and spill out on to the road to catch up before and after the weekly Spanish-language service by Father \u00d3scar Escobar. The 17th-century church\u2019s change in fortunes is not just down to the strength of the Colombian priest\u2019s sermons, or the healthy trade in community gossip and empanadas afterwards. It is on the frontline of a dash to Europe by Latin Americans, as growing numbers of migrants reject the mortal risks now inherent in trying to secure a new life in the USA. The European Asylum Support Office reported this month that an 11% increase in people seeking political asylum in Europe since last year is being driven by people fleeing economic disasters, political repression and criminal violence in Venezuela, El Salvador, Colombia, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru. Venezuelans have lodged some 18,400 asylum applications from January to May, roughly twice as many as during the same period in 2018, making them the nationality with the second-highest number of applications in Europe after Syrians. Meanwhile applications for refugee status by Central Americans have increased 4,000% compared with a decade ago. The trend to head across the ocean to Europe is in part a reaction to the pitiless approach of Donald Trump\u2019s White House, whose aggressive immigration policies have separated families at the border and drastically curtailed asylum and refugee resettlement. The dangers of attempting to reach the US through Mexico were brought home by the photograph of \u00d3scar Alberto Mart\u00ednez Ram\u00edrez and his 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria, who drowned trying to cross into Texas. Many Latin American migrants are judging it better to buy a plane ticket and face the bureaucracy of the European immigration authorities rather than risk the cruelty of the people smugglers and the apparent indifference of the US administration. Others describe a greater tolerance in Europe for Latin Americans who want to live out what was once called the American dream. The Trump administration has refused to grant protected status to people fleeing Venezuela\u2019s political and economic meltdown, but there is no visa requirement for Venezuelans coming to the EU\u2019s Schengen area.

When confronted with long, difficult and unpredictable situations \u2013 such as the current crisis in Nicaragua \u2013 the Spanish authorities tend to adopt a watching brief, said Paloma Favieres, director of policy and campaigns at the Spanish Refugee Aid Commission (Cear). Spain also has a hefty backlog and usually turns down asylum requests from those alleging persecution by the armed drug gangs known as maras \u2013 because the perpetrators are not state actors. Belgium, in contrast, recognises gang violence as a reason for granting refuge and is known for a comprehensive system of support for people in search of international protection. Those applying for asylum receive housing, food, medical follow-up, legal assistance, help with learning one of the three official languages of the country and the right to social support, said Susana Parraga, a social worker with Caritas International in Belgium. \u201cAll European countries are supposed to offer these guarantees \u2013 taking into account European reception directives \u2013 but significant differences between countries still exist,\u201d Parraga said.

      "bodyText": "Update added on 19 September 2019: Since publication the county court judgment secured by the letter writer SD against the builder has been set aside by the court, meaning there is no extant court judgement to enforce. Therefore all references to the judgment in the article must be read in the light of the fact that the outcome of the case is yet to be determined. - I have taken a builder to court over a botched roof installation. An independent surveyor concluded that it does not comply with building regulations or installation guidelines. I won by default and now have an \u00a38,000 county court judgment (CCJ) against the company, SIN Building Services. It refuses to pay and as it is a limited company there seems little way to enforce it. There is no trading address to send bailiffs to and it has opened a new company to run accounts through. It is a member of the Federation of Master Builders, TradeMark and the Consumer Protection Association, all of whom say there is nothing they can do.

Phones have become too big recently.</p> <p>Because the Honor 20\u2019s screen is flat, not curving at the sides to the metal edge, the phone is a little wider at 74mm than the screen size might suggest \u2013 0.6mm wider than the Huawei P30 Pro with its larger 6.47in screen. Still, it feels slick in the hand and is relatively easy to use.</p> <p>The FHD+ LCD screen itself is excellent, crisp, bright and colourful, with slim bezels, a hole punched in the top left corner through which the selfie camera pokes and good viewing angles all round. It can\u2019t match the top OLED displays, but then it doesn\u2019t cost \u00a3500-plus.</p> <p>The design is, however, a little dull, particularly in black compared with some of the flashier phones in 2019, including the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/01/honor-view-20-review-iphone-xs-48mp-camera-android\">Honor View20</a>.

The Honor 20 uses the same Kirin 980 chip as all of Huawei\u2019s top-flight phones and performs just as well.</p> <p>Technically it is a generation behind the top Snapdragon 855 chip from Qualcomm that\u2019s used in most other 2019 flagship phones, including the OnePlus 7 Pro, but the performance differences are only noticeable in the most graphically intensive games that do not support Huawei\u2019s GPU Turbo optimisations.</p> <p>So what you get is top-level performance at a mid-range price, which puts the likes of the similarly priced Google Pixel 3a XL to shame.</p> <p>Huawei, and therefore Honor, phones are the current battery life kings. The Honor 20 is no exception.</p> <p>With medium to heavy usage the phone lasted about 32 hours between charges, meaning it would make it all the way from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two.</p> <p>That was while using the Honor 20 as my primary device with lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Futurama from Google Play, a 30-minute phone call and about 20 photos.</p> <p>The Honor 20 lacks wireless charging but has relatively fast cable charging, reaching 80% in an hour and a full charge in under 90 minutes using the included power adapter and cable.</p> <h2>Magic UI 2.1</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3405b328e368ded3a36f14d16fa025f8b960f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a3405b328e368ded3a36f14d16fa025f8b960f1b/408_443_4083_2451/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gesture navigation options in Magic UI are some of the best.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 20 runs the latest of Magic UI 2.1, which is the firm\u2019s version of Android 9 Pie. Magic UI 2.1 is essentially a renamed version of parent company Huawei\u2019s EMUI 9.1, which is the software running on Huawei\u2019s top phone, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/huawei-p30-pro-review-leica-quad-camera-zoom\">P30 Pro</a>.</p> <p>Overall Magic UI 2.1 is a highly capable version of Android with a solid set of navigation gestures or traditional navigation buttons, lots of power saving features and long-term performance functions that keep it from being slowed down over time.</p> <p>The interface isn\u2019t as slick or as fluid as that running on a OnePlus or Google\u2019s Pixel phones, but it is getting better with each update. The trouble is the updates have been fairly slow in the past, but Honor said it will be keeping to a bi-monthly security update schedule (Google releases an Android security patch once a month) and expects a major update in mid-August with Android Q.</p> <p>Honor says it is \u201cconfident\u201d that it can <a href=\"https://www.hihonor.com/uk/honor-answers.html\">update the 20 with Android Q</a>. However, given the <a href=\"https://www.akingump.com/en/news-insights/reminder-commerce-department-prohibitions-pertaining-to-huawei.html\">complexities of US export law</a>, it may not be up to Honor and Huawei as to whether it can legally honour that commitment.</p> <h2>Camera</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d85d04cdee0da7982d2d51d5dc3fa837a8bfdb7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d85d04cdee0da7982d2d51d5dc3fa837a8bfdb7d/398_432_3978_2387/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camera app on the Honor 20 is good but HDR is a separate mode not part of the main photo mode.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Honor 20 has an evolved version of the excellent camera from the View 20. The phone technically has four cameras on the back: one 48MP standard camera, a 16MP super-wide angle camera, a 2MP fixed focus macro camera and a 2MP depth assist camera.</p> <p>However, the depth camera is just that, an assistant helping produce bokeh effects in portrait mode, not a camera in its own right. And while the macro camera sounds like a fun idea, the images produced are poor. Superficially they look fine, but zoom in at all on the image and you\u2019ll see a mess of over-sharpened pixels.</p> <p>Forget about two of the cameras and you\u2019re left with the main 48MP camera which is great, producing shots with high levels of detail, good range and colour. Low-light performance is pretty good too. It even produces better macro shots than the dedicated macro camera.</p> <p>The ultra-wide angle camera is also a lot of fun to use, turning those short-range landscape photos into large, expansive shots. It has noticeably worse middling-to-low light performance than the main camera, though, so best left for outdoor shots in good light.</p> <p>The one thing missing is an optical zoom; instead you get up to 10x digital zoom, which is pretty good but no match for anything with a 2 or 3x telephoto camera. Video capture is limited to 30FPS at 4K too.</p> <p>The camera app is pretty good, and Honor\u2019s AI system has toned down a lot since its inception, meaning I felt comfortable to leave it on.</p> <p>The front-facing 32MP camera pokes through a hole in the screen and is really very good, capturing detail-rich selfies even in fairly challenging lighting conditions.</p> <h2>Observations</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78eb378ef712a542e96920c37467c6da8cb874ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78eb378ef712a542e96920c37467c6da8cb874ab/346_570_4119_2472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The selfie camera pokes through a small hole in the top left corner of the screen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>The phone is pretty slippery so you\u2019ll need a case to keep it from dropping out of shallow pockets when you sit down</p></li> <li><p>The vibration motor is not as good as rivals in 2019, feeling baggy and imprecise</p></li> <li><p>The frame of the phone traps hairs and fluff</p></li> <li><p>Call quality was good, but the speaker is fairly small needing a bit of attention to get the correct alignment with your ear</p></li> <li><p>The phone curiously dropped to 3G more often in 4G areas than competing devices</p></li> </ul> <h2>Price</h2> <p>The Honor 20 costs <a href=\"https://www.hihonor.com/uk/product/honor-20\">\u00a3399</a> in either black or blue.</p> <p>For comparison, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/01/honor-view-20-review-iphone-xs-48mp-camera-android\">Honor View20</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/HONOR-storage-Camera-Display-Official-Sapphire-Blue/dp/B07MKY35D4/\">\u00a3500</a>, the OnePlus 7 costs <a href=\"https://www.oneplus.com/uk/oneplus-7\">\u00a3499</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/apr/24/huawei-p30-pro-review-leica-quad-camera-zoom\">Huawei P30 Pro</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.johnlewis.com/huawei-p30-pro-8-with-reverse-wireless-charge-android-8gb-ram-6-47-inch-4g-lte-sim-free-128gb/p4211038\">\u00a3899</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-the-cheaper-one\">Samsung Galaxy S10e</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/uk/smartphones/galaxy-s10e-sm-g970-hybrid-sim/SM-G970FZWDBTU/buy/\">\u00a3669</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/31/iphone-xr-review-apple-big-bezels-battery-face-id-screen\">Apple iPhone XR</a> costs <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-iphone/iphone-xr\">\u00a3749</a>.</p> <h2>Verdict</h2> <p>The Honor 20 is another cracking, well specified, solid performing, well made phone from Huawei. It\u2019s got the same top-end Kirin 980 chip as the excellent P30 Pro, long battery life and good screen.</p> <p>The camera is also pretty good, if you ignore the quad-camera hype and concentrate on the main and wide-angle cameras on the back.</p> <p>The Magic UI 2.1 software is even pretty good too, but it\u2019s impossible to look at the Honor 20 in isolation. The Trump factor and whether Huawei, and therefore, Honor will continue to have access to Google for crucial Android updates and the certificates needed for anything from DRM in video apps to Google Pay looms large.</p> <p>You\u2019d need a crystal ball to know for sure, but the expectation is that Huawei will eventually be tied into a deal between the US and China at the end of this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/internationaltrade\">trade war</a>.</p> <p>For now, the Honor 20 offers a nearly top-flight experience for just \u00a3400, which is a great deal. But it\u2019s a great deal that could easily sour if things don\u2019t go Huawei\u2019s way.</p> <blockquote> <p><strong>Pros:</strong> hole-punch notch, snappy performance, good battery life, good camera, good screen, dual-sim, fast fingerprint sensor</p> <p><strong>Cons:</strong> Magic UI not to everyone\u2019s taste, slow updates, Trump, no expandable storage, no water resistance, no wireless charging, no headphone socket, right-side fingerprint sensor not for left-handed</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"595e7cf806e4af0f1a24a08a747f57c9176e1727\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/595e7cf806e4af0f1a24a08a747f57c9176e1727/93_480_4364_2620/1000.jpg\" alt=\"honor 20 review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The four camera modules and flash cluster on the back of the phone in the top left corner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Other reviews</h2> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/06/best-smartphone-iphone-samsung-google-huawei-ios-android-buyers-guide-compared-ranked\">Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus and Huawei compared and ranked</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/01/honor-view-20-review-iphone-xs-48mp-camera-android\">Honor View20 review: top phone at half the cost of an iPhone XS</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/18/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-the-cheaper-one\">Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/may/17/google-pixel-3a-xl-review-camera-android-software\">Pixel 3a XL review: the cheaper Google phone to buy</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/27/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-review-novel-slider-finally-hits-the-uk\">Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review: novel slider finally hits the UK</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/oct/31/iphone-xr-review-apple-big-bezels-battery-face-id-screen\">iPhone XR review: Apple\u2019s cheaper battery king</a></strong></p></li> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/02/oneplus-6t-review-in-display-fingerprint-scanner-speedy-performance-all-screen-design-notch\">OnePlus 6T review: you\u2019d have to spend double to get better than this</a></strong></p></li> </ul>",

      "bodyText": "The Honor 20 is the first smartphone launched and put on sale by Huawei since Trump\u2019s blacklisting of the company in May. In effect this is one of the phones Trump tried to ban, but as it happened the Honor 20 had already passed through the Android certification process before Google was forced to stop working with Huawei. In reality, Trump\u2019s actions have had little to no effect on the \u00a3400 Honor 20, other than a slight delay in release in the west, and now there is an expectation that at least some of the restrictions will be lifted by Trump. The phone itself treads a tried and trusted formula: glass all-screen on the front, metal sides and a glass back. It weighs 174g, which is fairly light compared with the 200g-plus large phones, and its 7.9mm thickness compares favourably with rivals. The screen is also smaller than some recent gigantic rivals, at just 6.26in on the diagonal, which is welcome. Phones have become too big recently. Because the Honor 20\u2019s screen is flat, not curving at the sides to the metal edge, the phone is a little wider at 74mm than the screen size might suggest \u2013 0.6mm wider than the Huawei P30 Pro with its larger 6.47in screen. Still, it feels slick in the hand and is relatively easy to use. The FHD+ LCD screen itself is excellent, crisp, bright and colourful, with slim bezels, a hole punched in the top left corner through which the selfie camera pokes and good viewing angles all round. It can\u2019t match the top OLED displays, but then it doesn\u2019t cost \u00a3500-plus. The design is, however, a little dull, particularly in black compared with some of the flashier phones in 2019, including the Honor View20. Get it in blue for something a bit more interesting. There\u2019s no headphone socket and the fingerprint scanner is under the power button on the right hand side. It\u2019s fast, accurate and easy to reach with your right thumb, but less so with your left index fingers. Left-handed users might want to think twice before buying. Specifications Screen: 6.26in FHD+ LCD (412ppi) Processor: octa-core Huawei Kirin 980 RAM: 6GB of RAM Storage: 128GB Operating system: Magic UI 2.1 based on Android 9 Pie Camera: rear 48MP wide, 16MP ultra-wide, 2MP macro and 2MP depth sensor, 32MP selfie Connectivity: USB-C (2.0), LTE, wifi, NFC, Bluetooth 5 and GPS (dual-sim available in some regions) Dimensions: 154.3 x 74 x 7.9 mm Weight: 174g Reliable performance and battery life Huawei has a knack for making fast but power efficient processors and equipping lots of phones at various prices with the same top-of-the-range chips. The Honor 20 uses the same Kirin 980 chip as all of Huawei\u2019s top-flight phones and performs just as well. Technically it is a generation behind the top Snapdragon 855 chip from Qualcomm that\u2019s used in most other 2019 flagship phones, including the OnePlus 7 Pro, but the performance differences are only noticeable in the most graphically intensive games that do not support Huawei\u2019s GPU Turbo optimisations. So what you get is top-level performance at a mid-range price, which puts the likes of the similarly priced Google Pixel 3a XL to shame. Huawei, and therefore Honor, phones are the current battery life kings. The Honor 20 is no exception. With medium to heavy usage the phone lasted about 32 hours between charges, meaning it would make it all the way from 7am on day one until 3pm on day two. That was while using the Honor 20 as my primary device with lots of email, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 90 minutes of Futurama from Google Play, a 30-minute phone call and about 20 photos. The Honor 20 lacks wireless charging but has relatively fast cable charging, reaching 80% in an hour and a full charge in under 90 minutes using the included power adapter and cable. Magic UI 2.1 The Honor 20 runs the latest of Magic UI 2.1, which is the firm\u2019s version of Android 9 Pie. Magic UI 2.1 is essentially a renamed version of parent company Huawei\u2019s EMUI 9.1, which is the software running on Huawei\u2019s top phone, the P30 Pro. Overall Magic UI 2.1 is a highly capable version of Android with a solid set of navigation gestures or traditional navigation buttons, lots of power saving features and long-term performance functions that keep it from being slowed down over time. The interface isn\u2019t as slick or as fluid as that running on a OnePlus or Google\u2019s Pixel phones, but it is getting better with each update. The trouble is the updates have been fairly slow in the past, but Honor said it will be keeping to a bi-monthly security update schedule (Google releases an Android security patch once a month) and expects a major update in mid-August with Android Q. Honor says it is \u201cconfident\u201d that it can update the 20 with Android Q. However, given the complexities of US export law, it may not be up to Honor and Huawei as to whether it can legally honour that commitment. Camera The Honor 20 has an evolved version of the excellent camera from the View 20. The phone technically has four cameras on the back: one 48MP standard camera, a 16MP super-wide angle camera, a 2MP fixed focus macro camera and a 2MP depth assist camera. However, the depth camera is just that, an assistant helping produce bokeh effects in portrait mode, not a camera in its own right. And while the macro camera sounds like a fun idea, the images produced are poor. Superficially they look fine, but zoom in at all on the image and you\u2019ll see a mess of over-sharpened pixels. Forget about two of the cameras and you\u2019re left with the main 48MP camera which is great, producing shots with high levels of detail, good range and colour. Low-light performance is pretty good too. It even produces better macro shots than the dedicated macro camera. The ultra-wide angle camera is also a lot of fun to use, turning those short-range landscape photos into large, expansive shots. It has noticeably worse middling-to-low light performance than the main camera, though, so best left for outdoor shots in good light. The one thing missing is an optical zoom; instead you get up to 10x digital zoom, which is pretty good but no match for anything with a 2 or 3x telephoto camera. Video capture is limited to 30FPS at 4K too. The camera app is pretty good, and Honor\u2019s AI system has toned down a lot since its inception, meaning I felt comfortable to leave it on. The front-facing 32MP camera pokes through a hole in the screen and is really very good, capturing detail-rich selfies even in fairly challenging lighting conditions. Observations The phone is pretty slippery so you\u2019ll need a case to keep it from dropping out of shallow pockets when you sit down The vibration motor is not as good as rivals in 2019, feeling baggy and imprecise The frame of the phone traps hairs and fluff Call quality was good, but the speaker is fairly small needing a bit of attention to get the correct alignment with your ear The phone curiously dropped to 3G more often in 4G areas than competing devices Price The Honor 20 costs \u00a3399 in either black or blue. For comparison, the Honor View20 costs \u00a3500, the OnePlus 7 costs \u00a3499, the Huawei P30 Pro costs \u00a3899, the Samsung Galaxy S10e costs \u00a3669 and the Apple iPhone XR costs \u00a3749. Verdict The Honor 20 is another cracking, well specified, solid performing, well made phone from Huawei. It\u2019s got the same top-end Kirin 980 chip as the excellent P30 Pro, long battery life and good screen. The camera is also pretty good, if you ignore the quad-camera hype and concentrate on the main and wide-angle cameras on the back. The Magic UI 2.1 software is even pretty good too, but it\u2019s impossible to look at the Honor 20 in isolation. The Trump factor and whether Huawei, and therefore, Honor will continue to have access to Google for crucial Android updates and the certificates needed for anything from DRM in video apps to Google Pay looms large. You\u2019d need a crystal ball to know for sure, but the expectation is that Huawei will eventually be tied into a deal between the US and China at the end of this trade war. For now, the Honor 20 offers a nearly top-flight experience for just \u00a3400, which is a great deal. But it\u2019s a great deal that could easily sour if things don\u2019t go Huawei\u2019s way. Pros: hole-punch notch, snappy performance, good battery life, good camera, good screen, dual-sim, fast fingerprint sensor Cons: Magic UI not to everyone\u2019s taste, slow updates, Trump, no expandable storage, no water resistance, no wireless charging, no headphone socket, right-side fingerprint sensor not for left-handed Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, Samsung, OnePlus and Huawei compared and ranked Honor View20 review: top phone at half the cost of an iPhone XS Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the cheaper one Pixel 3a XL review: the cheaper Google phone to buy Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review: novel slider finally hits the UK iPhone XR review: Apple\u2019s cheaper battery king OnePlus 6T review: you\u2019d have to spend double to get better than this",

But slashers slowly crept back to the grave after a string of lesser offerings and, three films later, the Scream franchise followed suit with Scream 4\u2019s underperformance indicative of how audience tastes had changed in the 15 years since the original. Four years later, Scream returned on the small screen in the shape of a so-so MTV series telling a new story of traumatised teens, followed up by a second season and a two-hour spin-off but for superfans, there was a glaring problem: the Edvard Munch-inspired mask and the sinister voice that accompanied it didn\u2019t make an appearance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKHmb2LPEpw\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wKHmb2LPEpw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>So other than the title itself, there was little tying the show back to the original franchise and the show quietly died with about as much muted interest as it started with, a schlocky curio that failed to provoke enough curiosity.

      "bodyText": "In the 23 years since the release of Scream, the horror genre has both violently expanded and brutally contracted. There\u2019s been a wealth of films and shows populated by a variety of evils, from cursed dolls to Swedish maypole cults, but those featuring masked villains holding gleaming kitchen knives have mostly faded into the darkness. The slasher movie formula, which sees a group of attractive teenage archetypes stalked by a stab-happy killer, originated in the 1970s but was resurrected by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson\u2019s meta-horror which, in turn, also resurrected the entire genre, leading us to the scary movie saturation we\u2019re now seeing. But slashers slowly crept back to the grave after a string of lesser offerings and, three films later, the Scream franchise followed suit with Scream 4\u2019s underperformance indicative of how audience tastes had changed in the 15 years since the original.

He says: \u201cThis has left a bad taste in my mouth. I will hopefully never work in manufacturing ever again.\u201d</p> <p>Promises to save US manufacturing and prevent American jobs moving abroad were a key part of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. But since Trump took office in January 2017, nearly 200,000 jobs have been moved overseas, <a href=\"https://www.doleta.gov/tradeact/taa-data/petitions-determinations-data/petitions-results.cfm\">based</a> on Trade Adjustment Assistance certified petitions.</p> <p>That includes firms doing business with the US government. According to research by Good Jobs Nation, 14,444 jobs were moved abroad by the top 100 federal contractors in the United States in Trump\u2019s first two years in office. The rate of \u201coffshoring\u201d among the top 100 federal contractors actually <a href=\"http://goodjobsnation.org/content/uploads/2018/08/Broken-Promises2.pdf\">exceeds rates</a> throughout the Obama administration and the majority of the Bush administration, aside from 2008 when the economic recession hit.</p> <p>Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at UC Berkeley, says: \u201cThere has been relatively little change since Trump took office.

      "bodyText": "Next Friday, Eddie Martin will work his last day at the General Electric plant in Salem, Virginia, after working there for seven years. GE announced in June last year it was shutting down the Salem plant, which opened in 1955. More than 250 employees were affected, as those jobs will be sent overseas to India. Martin is one such employee. He says: \u201cIt\u2019s horrible. You have over 200 people losing their jobs just so the company can build a $200m plant in India and pay those people $3.50 an hour.\u201d Martin plans to go back to school and work in marine mechanics. He says: \u201cThis has left a bad taste in my mouth. I will hopefully never work in manufacturing ever again.\u201d Promises to save US manufacturing and prevent American jobs moving abroad were a key part of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign. But since Trump took office in January 2017, nearly 200,000 jobs have been moved overseas, based on Trade Adjustment Assistance certified petitions. That includes firms doing business with the US government. According to research by Good Jobs Nation, 14,444 jobs were moved abroad by the top 100 federal contractors in the United States in Trump\u2019s first two years in office. The rate of \u201coffshoring\u201d among the top 100 federal contractors actually exceeds rates throughout the Obama administration and the majority of the Bush administration, aside from 2008 when the economic recession hit. Harley Shaiken, a labor professor at UC Berkeley, says: \u201cThere has been relatively little change since Trump took office. Plant closings are devastating. For the worker, it is damaging and it can create the kind of stresses that cause divorces, break up families, and disrupt the ability to care for parents or young children. This kind of disruption creates far-reaching anxiety and anger and we saw that politically expressed in 2016.\u201d That leaves workers like those at the Virginia GE plant with a feeling of being lied to as they watch their livelihoods disappear. \u201cIt\u2019s taking away a livable wage in the area,\u201d says Darryl Castillo, who worked at the plant for six years and will be among the last wave of layoffsscheduled for early December. Castillo was involved in union negotiations to try to prevent the plant from closing, but the union\u2019s concession offerings to save GE money ended in failure.

      "body": "<p>On a rainy, pre-dawn Monday morning in the fields of the Rio Grande Valley along the Mexican border in south Texas, little constellations of flashlights twinkle across the green expanse. They are held by undocumented immigrants, mostly from Mexico, and mostly living in fear of arrest and deportation but working all the same to provide for their families. Their fingers twist the tie on bunches of parsley or hack stalks of kale until their palms blister. Most of Texas is still asleep.</p> <p>Many of them are paid on a contract basis, by the box. A box of cilantro will earn a worker $3; experienced farmworkers say they can fill one within an hour, which means a typical 5am to 6pm work day would earn them $39 total. The work can vary from physically uncomfortable and mundane (cilantro, lettuce, beets) to outright painful and dangerous (watermelon, parsley, grapefruit).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"933e95a2c66853178755855bff26731f579b0d58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/933e95a2c66853178755855bff26731f579b0d58/0_0_5000_3335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Farmworkers hand over the collard green bunches that they harvested in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farmworkers hand over the collard green bunches that they harvested in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ver\u00f3nica G C\u00e1rdenas/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The few women who work in the fields face even more hardships. Instances of workplace sexual harassment and rape are rampant and are both underreported and under-prosecuted. It is common for women to relent to a supervisor\u2019s advances because she can\u2019t risk losing her job or deportation. Most of these women are supporting children as well.</p> <p>In the fields of south Texas, those women represent a diverse cross-section of lives upturned by drug-related and domestic violence in Mexico. Under new US immigration protocols, these are extraordinarily tense times for immigrants \u2013 being caught by officials could mean being sent back or having your kids placed in a cage. And yet the women included in this piece refused to hide their faces or change their names.</p> <p>They want their stories told.</p> <h2>Janet, 36</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5c47169bee38a03cfe70b3d818b3fc655fba2764\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5c47169bee38a03cfe70b3d818b3fc655fba2764/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet, 36, left, and her mother Edith, 55 pose for a photo outside of Janet\u2019s house.

A 36-year-old veteran of fieldwork (she has been picking produce since she was 17), Castro is able to hold a conversation without stopping the swift movement of her knife. A bandanna covers her nose and mouth to keep the headache-inducing cilantro smell out; otherwise the headache lasts for hours after she\u2019s left the field.</p> <p>Parsley is worse: \u201cThere is a milk in the stems of the parsley that gets on us when we cut it,\u201d she explains. As a result, one day in the fields cutting parsley can mean two weeks of itchy, stinging skin that is rough to the touch. \u201cWe can\u2019t wear gloves because the boss says a piece of the glove could get into the product,\u201d she explains, and long sleeves would only press the milk into the skin.</p> <p>\u2018I\u2019m used to it,\u201d she shrugs, in her stoic way, as she scratches her scaly arm.</p> <p>Janet has worked with the same supervisor for nine years. She describes him as a good guy who has even lent her $200 when she needed it. Despite bending over for most of the day, she says she doesn\u2019t experience the same back pain that other farmworkers do. \u201cI\u2019m really fast at the onion, but there are some men who say I am taking their work. The response I have is that this work is for my kids.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>I just hope there is a way for us to get documents, because some of us are really working here.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Janet met her husband the first year she started working in the fields. Back at home, they have three children, each with developmental problems; one, the middle daughter, has autism and needs a part-time caretaker. Her older son has suffered epileptic seizures since he was a baby, and the youngest is starting to show developmental issues as well. Janet says her doctors believe the source of her children\u2019s problems are the chemicals used in the fields, but her undocumented status led her to never seek legal action. Plus, she didn\u2019t want to lose her job.</p> <p>Her solace is the Catholic church, and on her one day off \u2013 Sunday \u2013 she takes her family there. Afterwards they rush home, to avoid any potential run-ins with immigration authorities. She says she has heard rumors of immigration stings at parties and gatherings after church, and though she says she does not live in fear, she still says she doesn\u2019t like to take that risk.</p> <p>She hopes that someday she might be able to call herself an American citizen. \u201cI just hope there is a way for us to get documents, because some of us are really working here. Others are lazy and stay home, but I\u2019m really working hard,\u201d she says before putting her youngest to bed, seven hours before she\u2019ll need to arrive at the parsley field the next morning.</p> <h2>Edith, 55</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"60707d167c39fed7e88466e064d21ab1f0a1c66b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60707d167c39fed7e88466e064d21ab1f0a1c66b/0_0_3000_2001/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edith, 55, came to the U.S. nearly 20 years ago. \u201cI came to this country to give my family a better life.

Janet and her sister, both teenagers then, found work as housekeepers as well, but were getting harassed by men as they walked home from their jobs. One day, Janet\u2019s sister accepted a ride home and disappeared. Her brother, Edith\u2019s son, found his sister after weeks of searching in an apartment building in another town. It appeared that she and another girl had been being held there against their will and abused. Edith\u2019s son went to the police to report the crime, and Edith says the abductors were jailed for a week, her son was also punished: he was deported. \u201cThe investigator just told me to call if my daughter got abducted again,\u201d Edith recalls with disgust, \u201cand that\u2019s when I decided to move towns\u201d.</p> <p>Starting over, Edith threw herself into work in the fields. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the hard work,\u201d she says, \u201cI came to this country to fight.\u201d Over her two decades of work in the fields, Edith has earned herself a reputation among the men as a tough <em>chingona </em>\u2013 a badass woman.

She leans a ladder slippery with dew and rain against a tree, where it catches \u2013 hopefully tightly \u2013 on the branches. Then she makes her way up the 14-foot ladder, all the way to the top, to the last rung. Along the way, she is stretching to reach grapefruit, and tugging at them to get them to release and fall. Any that hit the ground can\u2019t be used, so she collects them all in a bag that is slung crossbody and hanging on one side of her hip. The bag weighs anywhere between 60 to 80lb when full of fruit.

      "bodyText": "On a rainy, pre-dawn Monday morning in the fields of the Rio Grande Valley along the Mexican border in south Texas, little constellations of flashlights twinkle across the green expanse. They are held by undocumented immigrants, mostly from Mexico, and mostly living in fear of arrest and deportation but working all the same to provide for their families. Their fingers twist the tie on bunches of parsley or hack stalks of kale until their palms blister. Most of Texas is still asleep. Many of them are paid on a contract basis, by the box. A box of cilantro will earn a worker $3; experienced farmworkers say they can fill one within an hour, which means a typical 5am to 6pm work day would earn them $39 total. The work can vary from physically uncomfortable and mundane (cilantro, lettuce, beets) to outright painful and dangerous (watermelon, parsley, grapefruit). The few women who work in the fields face even more hardships. Instances of workplace sexual harassment and rape are rampant and are both underreported and under-prosecuted. It is common for women to relent to a supervisor\u2019s advances because she can\u2019t risk losing her job or deportation. Most of these women are supporting children as well. In the fields of south Texas, those women represent a diverse cross-section of lives upturned by drug-related and domestic violence in Mexico. Under new US immigration protocols, these are extraordinarily tense times for immigrants \u2013 being caught by officials could mean being sent back or having your kids placed in a cage. And yet the women included in this piece refused to hide their faces or change their names. They want their stories told. Janet, 36 \u201cI think I work equally as fast as the men,\u201d Janet Castro says, bending over and slicing the roots from the greens of the cilantro harvest. A 36-year-old veteran of fieldwork (she has been picking produce since she was 17), Castro is able to hold a conversation without stopping the swift movement of her knife. A bandanna covers her nose and mouth to keep the headache-inducing cilantro smell out; otherwise the headache lasts for hours after she\u2019s left the field. Parsley is worse: \u201cThere is a milk in the stems of the parsley that gets on us when we cut it,\u201d she explains. As a result, one day in the fields cutting parsley can mean two weeks of itchy, stinging skin that is rough to the touch. \u201cWe can\u2019t wear gloves because the boss says a piece of the glove could get into the product,\u201d she explains, and long sleeves would only press the milk into the skin. \u2018I\u2019m used to it,\u201d she shrugs, in her stoic way, as she scratches her scaly arm. Janet has worked with the same supervisor for nine years. She describes him as a good guy who has even lent her $200 when she needed it. Despite bending over for most of the day, she says she doesn\u2019t experience the same back pain that other farmworkers do. \u201cI\u2019m really fast at the onion, but there are some men who say I am taking their work. The response I have is that this work is for my kids.\u201d Janet met her husband the first year she started working in the fields. Back at home, they have three children, each with developmental problems; one, the middle daughter, has autism and needs a part-time caretaker. Her older son has suffered epileptic seizures since he was a baby, and the youngest is starting to show developmental issues as well. Janet says her doctors believe the source of her children\u2019s problems are the chemicals used in the fields, but her undocumented status led her to never seek legal action. Plus, she didn\u2019t want to lose her job. Her solace is the Catholic church, and on her one day off \u2013 Sunday \u2013 she takes her family there. Afterwards they rush home, to avoid any potential run-ins with immigration authorities. She says she has heard rumors of immigration stings at parties and gatherings after church, and though she says she does not live in fear, she still says she doesn\u2019t like to take that risk. She hopes that someday she might be able to call herself an American citizen. \u201cI just hope there is a way for us to get documents, because some of us are really working here. Others are lazy and stay home, but I\u2019m really working hard,\u201d she says before putting her youngest to bed, seven hours before she\u2019ll need to arrive at the parsley field the next morning. Edith, 55 Edith is Janet\u2019s mom, though her outspoken manner contrasts sharply with her daughter\u2019s low-key, reticent demeanor. If Edith comes off as strong-headed, she says that her life has demanded it. Edith worked as a paramedic in Mexico, but she could barely make ends meet. \u201cI lived in total poverty in Mexico,\u201d she says, her eyes moistening. \u201cMy home was just a wood shack and when it rained we would get wet. I came here because this is a country of opportunity.\u201d Today she lives with her daughter Janet and her daughter\u2019s family, but years ago their lives were turned upside down, shortly after Edith came across the Rio Grande River in the early 1990s alone in an inner tube at night. Four months after Edith arrived and found work as a housekeeper for a local singer, she voyaged back to Veracruz, Mexico, to bring her three teenage children across the border. Janet and her sister, both teenagers then, found work as housekeepers as well, but were getting harassed by men as they walked home from their jobs. One day, Janet\u2019s sister accepted a ride home and disappeared. Her brother, Edith\u2019s son, found his sister after weeks of searching in an apartment building in another town. It appeared that she and another girl had been being held there against their will and abused. Edith\u2019s son went to the police to report the crime, and Edith says the abductors were jailed for a week, her son was also punished: he was deported. \u201cThe investigator just told me to call if my daughter got abducted again,\u201d Edith recalls with disgust, \u201cand that\u2019s when I decided to move towns\u201d. Starting over, Edith threw herself into work in the fields. \u201cI don\u2019t mind the hard work,\u201d she says, \u201cI came to this country to fight.\u201d Over her two decades of work in the fields, Edith has earned herself a reputation among the men as a tough chingona \u2013 a badass woman. Once, while working the watermelon fields where rattlesnakes are notorious, Edith used her paramedic skills to save the life of a worker who was bitten by a snake: \u201cI put my mouth to it [his leg] and sucked out the venom and spit it out.\u201d Such bravery has turned her into a kind of mentor to other women working in the fields. She also informally counsels other female farmworkers against relenting to the pressure of men soliciting sex in exchange for better working conditions. \u201cI always tell them, \u2018We have worked hard to be here, now don\u2019t let yourself down.\u2019\u201d She says she still sees young women taken off by the supervisors to corners of the fields, but she has hope: \u201cPeople know their rights a lot better now than they used to.\u201d Commonplace labor issues such as intimidation, refusal of collective bargaining rights, wage withholding or unpaid overtime work are also tremendous hurdles that they have few recourses to fight. A report by Human Rights Watch notes that although US law entitles undocumented workers to workplace protections, \u201cthe US government\u2019s interest in protecting unauthorized workers from abuse conflicts with its interest in deporting them.\u201d That report was written in 2015, but President Trump\u2019s heightened drive for deportation and border closure has only made things more impossible for undocumented farmworkers attempting to protect their labor rights. That\u2019s part of why Edith still considers giving up everything and returning with her family to Mexico. \u201cWhen you\u2019re illegal here, it\u2019s like you\u2019re in prison. If you need help, there\u2019s nowhere to go.\u201d Mar\u00eda Rebecca, 23 Mar\u00eda Rebecca came to the US when she was pregnant with her second child three years ago, leaving her older son with her parents back in Michoac\u00e1n. \u201cMy mom spent her whole life working in the fields [in Mexico], and the only reason she stopped was because one of the veins in her eye popped while she was working.\u201d Her sister and her dad are still back in Michoac\u00e1n working the fields, and it was her other sister who called her to Texas, where she had already moved to. \u201cMy sister knew that I loved working in the fields, and she told me I could make a lot more money here.\u201d Back in Mexico she would make about $30 a week. Here, she could make $200 a week \u2013 if, that is, she was willing to take on the most dangerous types of work \u2013 harvesting in the orchards. She was: farm work is Mar\u00eda Rebecca\u2019s life. \u201cI started working in the fields when I was eight years old. I saw that the rest of the kids were buying lollipops after school, but we didn\u2019t have enough money for me to buy them, so I decided to work.\u201d She says that while still in elementary school, she quit attending five days a week so that she could work a few days a week and earn a little spending money. What kept her in school was the free lunch on those days; at home, meals were more irregular, she says with a shrug, as she swings on a bench beneath a pecan tree in her sister\u2019s front yard. Her daughter sits quietly beside her, wide-eyed with her little feet barely dangling off the bench. Throughout middle school Mar\u00eda Rebecca says she continued working in the fields, priding herself on making enough money to buy instant noodles for lunch. By ninth grade, she dropped out of school completely and turned to farm work full time, but she does not speak about it with much regret. While some kids feel pride by excelling in school or sports, Mar\u00eda Rebecca felt pride in excelling at farm work. She recounts her working experiences like a more privileged person might recount their travel adventures. \u201cI remember working the strawberry fields and having to walk up the side of a hill barefoot because it was too muddy to wear boots.

At the same time, Wyatt said supporters of constitutional recognition need to respect those with opposing views, including those of Pauline Hanson, who claimed that, as an Australian-born white woman, she too was \u201cindigenous\u201d, saying he admired the One Nation leader. Wyatt, the first Indigenous person to hold the portfolio, has pledged to work towards holding a referendum on Indigenous recognition within three years, following Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese\u2019s promise to work together to find consensus. The announcement was welcomed by many Indigenous leaders. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really important, this announcement today, and clearly has the support of prime minister Morrison \u2026 this is a really significant day in the nation\u2019s history, it\u2019s a day to be celebrated,\u201d professor Megan Davis, a co-author of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, told the ABC.

Shadow minister for Indigenous Australians Linda Burney said Labor would work constructively with the government on the issue. Constitutional change doesn\u2019t come easy, she stressed, with only eight out of 44 referendums held to date succeeding. But the MP is confident the time for change has \u201cwell and truly come\u201d. \u201cI honestly believe that the Australian public is ready for constitutional reform to recognise first nations people in the constitution,\u201d Burney told reporters in Sydney.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that causes haemorrhages, organ failure and swelling of the brain and is potentially fatal to both dogs and humans. Before this year NSW had never had a reported canine death from the disease. In the past three months there have been seven. Prof Jacqueline Norris, an expert in veterinary medicine from the University of Sydney, said vets were grappling with the disease. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had leptospirosis,\u201d Norris said. \u201cNow we\u2019ve got seven fatalities in three months. It\u2019s like zero to 100 in a short period of time.\u201d A vaccine against leptospirosis exists, and is widely used in Queensland, but it is not regularly prescribed in NSW owing to the rarity of the disease. Pet owners are now advised to seek out the vaccination, keep their dogs away from puddles and ponds, wash their hands when feeding or touching their dogs, and remove food scraps that could attract rodents. The disease infects dogs and humans through the gums, the mucous membranes in eyes and abrasions in skin \u2013 and can stay alive in water and moist environments. On Sunday a vet in Potts Point warned that two infected dogs had played at the same park \u2013 Ward Park on Devonshire Street \u2013 and blamed flooding caused by the construction of light rail. In February, after a spate of rat sightings, the City of Sydney said unprecedented levels of construction were creating \u201cincreased rat movements\u201d. At the same time a larger, hungrier breed of rat is slowly gaining supremacy in the city against other breeds, potentially furthering the spread of leptospirosis. Affected dogs become lethargic, abnormally quiet and develop haemorrhages on their skin, or blood in their urine, Norris said. \u201cIn Sydney, some of the fatal cases presented because they weren\u2019t producing urine because the kidneys shut down,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cases that have come in to us have been dead within 48 to 72 hours.

The foreign secretary stressed Johnson\u2019s refusal to answer questions on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and said his rival\u2019s threat to shut down parliament to force through no deal could lead to civil unrest.

The former has defended Kim Darroch in the face of personal attacks from Donald Trump, and also pledged to keep the diplomat in place if he becomes PM.

      "bodyText": "Top story: Johnson calls rival a \u2018defeatist\u2019 over Brexit policy Good morning briefers. I\u2019m Martin Farrer and here are the top stories you need to know about today. Jeremy Hunt has accused Boris Johnson of putting personal ambition before the national interest as the two candidates for the Tory leadership clashed in a live television debate last night. The foreign secretary stressed Johnson\u2019s refusal to answer questions on whether he would resign if he failed to deliver Brexit by 31 October and said his rival\u2019s threat to shut down parliament to force through no deal could lead to civil unrest. Johnson in turn called Hunt a \u201cdefeatist\u201d and bemoaned his opponent\u2019s \u201cmanagerial style\u201d and love of detail. The pair also clashed over tax policy, while Johnson gave equivocal answers on issues including HS2, Heathrow\u2019s third runway, and abortion and LGBT rights in Northern Ireland. Martin Kettle writes that Johnson \u201cplayed the Oxford Union smart arse\u201d and in the process showed why he would be \u201cthe most ill-qualified prime minister of modern times\u201d. In a related opinion piece, an exasperated David Conn asks why the Brexit debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the large financial contribution the EU has made to deprived areas of the UK. He cites the imperious Angel of the North as a typically unheralded example; the famous sculpture might never have been erected had it not been for money from Brussels. But, as he notes, a worker at nearby Nissan once told him he voted leave because the north-east got \u201cbugger all\u201d from the EU. * * * Leak row worsens \u2013 The growing tension between London and Washington over our ambassador\u2019s leaked emails provided another flashpoint for Hunt and Johnson in the Tory debate. The former has defended Kim Darroch in the face of personal attacks from Donald Trump, and also pledged to keep the diplomat in place if he becomes PM. In contrast, Johnson refused to condemn the US president. Darroch pulled out of a meeting with trade secretary Liam Fox and Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka in Washington yesterday and his future looks uncertain after the president\u2019s refusal to deal with him. * * * \u2018Don\u2019t panic!\u2019 \u2013 Britain\u2019s approach to climate change is like \u201cDad\u2019s Army\u201d and action to slash greenhouse gas emissions is lagging far behind what is needed, according to the government\u2019s own advisers.

The Commons voted 383 to 73 to extend marriage equality and abortion rights were granted in a vote by 332 to 99. Supporters greeted the outcome as a \u201cday for the history books\u201d. Activists will also be pleased that Nicki Minaj has pulled out of a concert in Saudi Arabia next week over the kingdom\u2019s lack of support for women and LGBT people. * * * PNG massacre \u2013 At least 15 women and children have been killed in Papua New Guinea in one of the country\u2019s worst outbreaks of tribal violence for years. Attackers armed with guns and long knives descended on the highland village of Karida in Hela province on Monday morning and began slaughtering people at random.

He starred in a number of Hollywood classics in the 1960s but fell foul of the industry because of his fierce temper and unpredictability. Most infamously, a row with Dennis Hopper during the pre-production of Easy Rider, the 1969 counterculture biker movie, led to Torn being replaced by Jack Nicholson before shooting began. However, he found redemption when cast as the foulmouthed talk-show producer Artie in The Larry Sanders Show for which he won an Emmy in 1996. Today in Focus podcast: Is Jeremy Hunt fit to be PM? Our health policy editor, Denis Campbell, talks about what Jeremy Hunt\u2019s record-breaking stint as health secretary tells us about his suitability to be the next prime minister. Some say he was a success because he secured more funding for the NHS while others argue his treatment of junior doctors was shameful.

      "bodyText": "Britain could look back more than 400 years to the reign of Queen Elizabeth I for inspiration on how to reboot the economy and tackle inequality, according to a joint winner of one of the most valuable prizes in economics. Simon Szreter, a professor of history and public policy at Cambridge University, his wife, Hilary Cooper, an economics consultant, and their son Ben Szreter, the chief executive of a community-based charity in Cambridge, were collectively one of two winners of the inaugural IPPR economics prize, worth a total of \u00a3100,000. Their entry focused on previous golden eras in UK economic growth that could help revitalise modern Britain. The Elizabethan poor law of 1601 forced the creation of one of the world\u2019s first universal welfare systems and spurred one of the strongest periods of economic growth in UK history. It forced every parish in England to create a fund to support orphans, widows, elderly, disabled, ill and unemployed people, using progressive tax levies that meant the rich contributed most. The Szreter family argued that an economy thrived most when citizens were supported by a strong social security system. The IPPR prize ranks as the third most valuable in economics, behind the 9m Swedish krona (\u00a3760,000) Nobel award and the \u00a3250,000 Wolfson prize, which was launched in 2011 by the Tory peer and Next chief executive, Simon Wolfson. The other winner was a group of seven workers all aged 27 and under at London Economics, a consultancy, who proposed to devolve greater power to the regions of Britain, including moving 15,000 civil service jobs outside of the capital. The IPPR received more than 200 entries, which were judged by a panel including John Mills, the founder of JML, who was a funder of the award.",

His name was Bill Kaysing. </p> <p>It began as \u201ca hunch, an intuition\u201d, before turning into \u201ca true conviction\u201d \u2013 that the US lacked the technical prowess to make it to the moon (or, at least, to the moon and back). Kaysing had actually contributed to the US space programme, albeit tenuously: between 1956 and 1963, he was an employee of Rocketdyne, a company that helped to design the Saturn V rocket engines. In 1976, he self-published a pamphlet called We Never Went to the Moon: America\u2019s Thirty Billion Dollar Swindle, which sought evidence for his conviction by means of grainy photocopies and ludicrous theories. Yet somehow he established a few perennials that are kept alive to this day in Hollywood movies and Fox News documentaries, Reddit forums and YouTube channels.</p> <p>Despite the extraordinary volume of evidence (including 382kg of moon rock collected across six missions; corroboration from Russia, Japan and China; and <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html\" title=\"\">images from the Nasa Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> showing the tracks made by the astronauts in the moondust), belief in the moon-hoax conspiracy has blossomed since 1969. Among 9/11 truthers, anti-vaxxers, chemtrailers, flat-Earthers, Holocaust deniers and Sandy Hook conspiracists, the idea that the moon landings were faked isn\u2019t even a source of anger any more \u2013 it is just a given fact.</p> <p>The podcast kingpin Joe Rogan is among the doubters. So too is the YouTuber Shane Dawson. A sociology professor in New Jersey was exposed last year for telling his students the landings were fake. While Kaysing relied on photocopied samizdat to alert the world, now conspiracists have the subreddit r/moonhoax to document how Nasa was \u201cso lazy\u201d it used the same moon rover for Apollo 15, 16 and 17; or how \u201cthey have been trolling us for years\u201d; or to bring up the fact there is \u201cone thing I can\u2019t get my head around ...\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe reality is, the internet has made it possible for people to say whatever the hell they like to a broader number of people than ever before,\u201d sighs Roger Launius, a former chief historian of Nasa. \u201cAnd the truth is, Americans love conspiracy theories. Every time something big happens, somebody has a counter-explanation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"521e946c92184ae3f151f6a9f569d5348f023904\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521e946c92184ae3f151f6a9f569d5348f023904/0_0_1540_990/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bill Kaysing, the man who started the moon-hoax conspiracy.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"643\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bill Kaysing, the man who started the moon-hoax conspiracy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: www.billkaysing.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turns out British people love conspiracy theories, too. Last year, the daytime TV show This Morning welcomed a guest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnc_X-oDWsE\" title=\"\">who argued that no one could have walked on the moon</a> as the moon is made of light. Martin Kenny claimed: \u201cIn the past, you saw the moon landings and there was no way to check any of it. Now, in the age of technology, a lot of young people are now investigating for themselves.\u201d A <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/science/articles-reports/2019/04/25/which-science-based-conspiracy-theories-do-britons\" title=\"\">recent YouGov poll found that one in six British people agreed</a> with the statement: \u201cThe moon landings were staged.\u201d Four per cent believed the hoax theory was \u201cdefinitely true\u201d, 12% that it was \u201cprobably true\u201d, with a further 9% registering as don\u2019t knows. Moon hoaxism was more prevalent among the young: 21 % of 24- to 35-year-olds agreed that the moon landings were staged, compared with 13% of over-55s.</p> <p>Kaysing\u2019s original queries are fuelling this. One is the fact that no stars are visible in the pictures; another is the lack of a blast crater under the landing module; a third is to do with the way the shadows fall. People who know what they are talking about have wasted hours explaining such \u201canomalies\u201d (they are to do with, respectively, camera-exposure times, the way thrust works in a vacuum and the reflective qualities of moondust). Yet until his death in 2005, Kaysing maintained that the whole thing was a fraud, filmed in a TV studio. \u201cIt\u2019s well documented that Nasa was often badly managed and had poor quality control,\u201d he told Wired in 1994. \u201cBut as of 1969, we could suddenly perform manned flight upon manned flight? With complete success? It\u2019s just against all statistical odds.\u201d</p> <p>He was right about that at least. When the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 in October 1957 (followed one month later by Sputnik 2, containing Laika the dog), the US space programme was all but non-existent. Nasa was founded in 1958 and managed to launch Alan Shepard into space in May 1961 \u2013 but when John F Kennedy announced that the US \u201cshould commit itself to achieve the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth\u201d, it seemed a stretch. By the mid-60s, Nasa was consuming more than 4% of the US federal budget, but while the Soviets were achieving more firsts \u2013 the first woman in space (1963), the first extra-vehicular activity, ie spacewalk (1965) \u2013 the Americans experienced various setbacks, including a launchpad fire that killed all three Apollo 1 astronauts.</p> <p>If you have ever been to the Science Museum in London, you will know that the lunar module was basically made of tinfoil. Apollo 8 had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/nov/30/apollo-8-mission\" title=\"\">orbited the moon in 1968</a>, but, as Armstrong remarked, correcting course and landing on the moon was \u201cfar and away the most complex part of the flight\u201d. He rated walking around on the surface one out of 10 for difficulty (despite the problems he had with the TV cable wrapping around his feet), \u201cbut I thought the lunar descent was probably a 13\u201d.</p> <p>That is until you compare it with the difficulty of maintaining a lie to the entire world for five decades without a single slip from any Nasa employee. You would also have to imagine that 2019-era special effects were available to Nasa in 1969 and not one of the 600 million TV viewers noticed anything amiss. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a decent indication of what Hollywood special effects could do at the time \u2013 and it\u2019s extremely shonky. It genuinely was simpler to film on location.</p> <p>If we pass over \u201cWorld war two bomber found on moon\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/62440303@N04/5683785190/\" title=\"\">a Sunday Sport </a><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/62440303@N04/5683785190/\" title=\"\">front page from 1988</a> \u2013 the moon-hoax theory entered the modern era in 2001, when Fox News broadcast a documentary called <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5ZwUX0uRZE\" title=\"\">Did We Land on the Moon?</a> Hosted by the X-Files actor Mitch Pileggi, it repackaged Kaysing\u2019s arguments for a new audience. Launius, who was working at Nasa at the time, recalls much banging of heads against consoles. \u201cFor many years, we refused to respond to this stuff. It wasn\u2019t worth giving it a hearing. But when Fox News aired that so-called documentary \u2013 stating unequivocally \u2018We haven\u2019t landed on the moon\u2019 \u2013 it really raised the level. We began to receive all kinds of questions.\u201d</p> <p>Most of the calls came not from conspiracists, but from parents and teachers. \u201cPeople were saying: \u2018My kid saw this, how do I respond?\u2019 So, with some trepidation, Nasa put up a webpage and sent out some materials to teachers.\u201d</p> <p>A particular bugbear in the Fox News documentary was a poll claiming that 20% of Americans believed the moon landing was faked. Launius says that polls tend to put the figure at between 4% and 5%, but it\u2019s easy to phrase poll questions to achieve a more eye-catching result. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a hearing in a serious periodical \u2013 even an offhand comment in a movie \u2013 it just seeds this stuff.\u201d He cites a scene in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Interstellar (2014) in which a schoolteacher informs Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character that the moon landings were hoaxed in order to win the propaganda war against the Soviet Union. \u201cIt\u2019s a throwaway in the film. But it really did churn up a big response.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver Morton, the author of The Moon: A History for the Future, believes the persistence of the moon hoax isn\u2019t surprising. Given an implausible event for which there is lots of evidence (Apollo 11) and a plausible event for which there is zero evidence (the moon hoax), some people will opt for the latter. \u201cThe point of Apollo was to show how powerful the American government was in terms of actually doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cThe point of moon-hoax theory is to show how powerful the American government was in terms of making people believe things that weren\u2019t true.\u201d But the hoax narrative was only really possible as Apollo never led anywhere \u2013 there were no further missions after 1972. \u201cAs the American mind turns back to paranoia in the 1970s, it becomes more pleasing to believe in this,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca357ceb6f369d389de124851f53925ae4c9ce45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca357ceb6f369d389de124851f53925ae4c9ce45/0_0_3504_2227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"636\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bond\u2019s to blame ... Sean Connery in Diamonds Are Forever.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/UNITED ARTISTS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>James Bond has to take a small share of the blame. In Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Sean Connery busts into a Nasa facility by way of a Las Vegas casino. A chase ensues across a film set dressed up to look like the moon, complete with earthbound astronauts. But here it\u2019s more like a visual joke, a way of justifying a moon buggy chase across the Nevada desert. By the time of Peter Hyams\u2019 Kaysingian conspiracy thriller Capricorn One (1978), the idea that the government was fooling everyone was no laughing matter. Here it\u2019s about a Mars mission that goes wrong. The authorities opt to fake it and kill the astronauts (one of whom is played by OJ Simpson) to prevent them revealing the truth. In the post-Watergate era, the idea that the government could lie on this scale had become much more plausible.</p> <p>Apollo marked a turning point between the optimism of the 60s and the disappointments of the 70s. \u201cWe can put a man on the moon so why can\u2019t we do X?\u201d became a common refrain. As Morton says: \u201cYes, the government can set itself an extraordinary goal and go on to achieve it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can win the war in Vietnam, or clean up the inner cities, or cure cancer or any of the things that Americans might have actually wanted more. The idea that the government isn\u2019t really powerful, it just pretends it is \u2013 you can see how it feeds into the moon hoax.\u201d</p> <p>Moon-hoax theories tend to be about what didn\u2019t happen rather than what did. Conspiracists are divided on whether the earlier Apollo, Mercury, Gemini and Atlas missions were also fakes, whether Laika or Yuri Gagarin ever made it into space, and what role Kubrick played. But while the first generation of lunar conspiracists were motivated by anger, these days it\u2019s more likely to be boredom. The line between conspiracy and entertainment is far more blurry.</p> <p>Still, while irritating for those involved \u2013 Buzz Aldrin punched moon conspiracist Bart Sibrel in 2002 \u2013 in one sense the conspiracy idea is harmless, at least compared with misinformation about vaccinations or mass murders. Morton notes that it is one of the few conspiracy theories that isn\u2019t tainted by antisemitism. Nor does it seem to be one to which Donald Trump, the ultimate product of news-as-entertainment, subscribes. The dynamics of the modern internet have clearly not helped: look up Apollo videos on YouTube and before long moon-hoax documentaries start lining up in the autoplay queue. But there is little evidence that Russian disinformation agents have spread moon conspiracies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/aug/23/russian-trolls-spread-vaccine-misinformation-on-twitter\" title=\"\">as they have anti-vaxxing propaganda, for example</a>. Although, if you think about it, it would make perfect sense for them to do so: a neat way of restoring Russian prestige while establishing continuity between the cold war and the information wars.</p> <p>Then again, the USSR had the means to expose the Americans at the time; it was listening in. \u201cWe were there at Soviet military base 32103,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/09/alexei-leonov-first-man-to-walk-in-space-soviet-cosmonaut\" title=\"\">the Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov</a> recently recalled. \u201cI swear to God we sat there with our fingers crossed. We hoped the guys would make it. We wanted this to happen. We knew those who were on board and they knew us, too.\u201d </p> <p>The growing strength of the hoax theory is \u201cone of the things that happens as time recedes and these events are lost\u201d, laments Launius. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it with the second world war and the Holocaust. A lot of the witnesses are passing from the scene and it\u2019s easy for people to deny that it took place. Who is left to counteract things that are untrue? Mythologies develop and become the dominant theme.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps the hardest thing to believe in is the idea that humans might have accomplished something transcendent \u2013 something that even brought out the best in Nixon. \u201cBecause of what you have done, the heavens have become part of man\u2019s world,\u201d he said in his telephone call to Aldrin and Armstrong on the moon. \u201cAnd as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.\u201d</p> <p>We have less faith in ourselves these days. Most moon conspiracists treat the whole thing as a joke, a rabbit hole to go down from time to time. Perhaps <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jul/06/everyones-going-to-the-moon-again-apollo-11-50th-aniversary\" title=\"\">if Nasa returns to the moon</a> \u2013 possibly as early as 2024, depending on Trump\u2019s whims \u2013 it will be replaced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/apr/30/trump-mission-mars-nasa-space-flight\" title=\"\">in time by Mars conspiracies</a>.</p> <p>Still, you could see the persistence of the moon conspiracy as a compliment to the Apollo scientists. \u201cIn a way, the moon hoaxers are taking the Apollo missions far more seriously than most people do,\u201d says Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that they really care. They think that Apollo really mattered.\u201d The truth is that the moon landings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/dec/16/apollo-legacy-moon-space-riley\" title=\"\">didn\u2019t really change life on Earth</a>. Not yet anyway.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 and 11 July 2019. An earlier version said that Nasa launched Alan Shepard into orbit in May 1961. However, that flight was suborbital. In addition, Nasa was consuming more than 4% of the US federal budget in the 1960s, not more than 4% of the country\u2019s GDP as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.</p>",

Among 9/11 truthers, anti-vaxxers, chemtrailers, flat-Earthers, Holocaust deniers and Sandy Hook conspiracists, the idea that the moon landings were faked isn\u2019t even a source of anger any more \u2013 it is just a given fact. The podcast kingpin Joe Rogan is among the doubters. So too is the YouTuber Shane Dawson. A sociology professor in New Jersey was exposed last year for telling his students the landings were fake. While Kaysing relied on photocopied samizdat to alert the world, now conspiracists have the subreddit r/moonhoax to document how Nasa was \u201cso lazy\u201d it used the same moon rover for Apollo 15, 16 and 17; or how \u201cthey have been trolling us for years\u201d; or to bring up the fact there is \u201cone thing I can\u2019t get my head around ...\u201d \u201cThe reality is, the internet has made it possible for people to say whatever the hell they like to a broader number of people than ever before,\u201d sighs Roger Launius, a former chief historian of Nasa. \u201cAnd the truth is, Americans love conspiracy theories. Every time something big happens, somebody has a counter-explanation.\u201d It turns out British people love conspiracy theories, too. Last year, the daytime TV show This Morning welcomed a guest who argued that no one could have walked on the moon as the moon is made of light. Martin Kenny claimed: \u201cIn the past, you saw the moon landings and there was no way to check any of it. Now, in the age of technology, a lot of young people are now investigating for themselves.\u201d A recent YouGov poll found that one in six British people agreed with the statement: \u201cThe moon landings were staged.\u201d Four per cent believed the hoax theory was \u201cdefinitely true\u201d, 12% that it was \u201cprobably true\u201d, with a further 9% registering as don\u2019t knows. Moon hoaxism was more prevalent among the young: 21 % of 24- to 35-year-olds agreed that the moon landings were staged, compared with 13% of over-55s. Kaysing\u2019s original queries are fuelling this. One is the fact that no stars are visible in the pictures; another is the lack of a blast crater under the landing module; a third is to do with the way the shadows fall. People who know what they are talking about have wasted hours explaining such \u201canomalies\u201d (they are to do with, respectively, camera-exposure times, the way thrust works in a vacuum and the reflective qualities of moondust). Yet until his death in 2005, Kaysing maintained that the whole thing was a fraud, filmed in a TV studio. \u201cIt\u2019s well documented that Nasa was often badly managed and had poor quality control,\u201d he told Wired in 1994. \u201cBut as of 1969, we could suddenly perform manned flight upon manned flight? With complete success? It\u2019s just against all statistical odds.\u201d He was right about that at least. When the Soviets launched Sputnik 1 in October 1957 (followed one month later by Sputnik 2, containing Laika the dog), the US space programme was all but non-existent. Nasa was founded in 1958 and managed to launch Alan Shepard into space in May 1961 \u2013 but when John F Kennedy announced that the US \u201cshould commit itself to achieve the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the Earth\u201d, it seemed a stretch. By the mid-60s, Nasa was consuming more than 4% of the US federal budget, but while the Soviets were achieving more firsts \u2013 the first woman in space (1963), the first extra-vehicular activity, ie spacewalk (1965) \u2013 the Americans experienced various setbacks, including a launchpad fire that killed all three Apollo 1 astronauts. If you have ever been to the Science Museum in London, you will know that the lunar module was basically made of tinfoil. Apollo 8 had orbited the moon in 1968, but, as Armstrong remarked, correcting course and landing on the moon was \u201cfar and away the most complex part of the flight\u201d. He rated walking around on the surface one out of 10 for difficulty (despite the problems he had with the TV cable wrapping around his feet), \u201cbut I thought the lunar descent was probably a 13\u201d. That is until you compare it with the difficulty of maintaining a lie to the entire world for five decades without a single slip from any Nasa employee. You would also have to imagine that 2019-era special effects were available to Nasa in 1969 and not one of the 600 million TV viewers noticed anything amiss. Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) is a decent indication of what Hollywood special effects could do at the time \u2013 and it\u2019s extremely shonky. It genuinely was simpler to film on location. If we pass over \u201cWorld war two bomber found on moon\u201d \u2013 a Sunday Sport front page from 1988 \u2013 the moon-hoax theory entered the modern era in 2001, when Fox News broadcast a documentary called Did We Land on the Moon? Hosted by the X-Files actor Mitch Pileggi, it repackaged Kaysing\u2019s arguments for a new audience. Launius, who was working at Nasa at the time, recalls much banging of heads against consoles. \u201cFor many years, we refused to respond to this stuff. It wasn\u2019t worth giving it a hearing. But when Fox News aired that so-called documentary \u2013 stating unequivocally \u2018We haven\u2019t landed on the moon\u2019 \u2013 it really raised the level. We began to receive all kinds of questions.\u201d Most of the calls came not from conspiracists, but from parents and teachers. \u201cPeople were saying: \u2018My kid saw this, how do I respond?\u2019 So, with some trepidation, Nasa put up a webpage and sent out some materials to teachers.\u201d A particular bugbear in the Fox News documentary was a poll claiming that 20% of Americans believed the moon landing was faked. Launius says that polls tend to put the figure at between 4% and 5%, but it\u2019s easy to phrase poll questions to achieve a more eye-catching result. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s a hearing in a serious periodical \u2013 even an offhand comment in a movie \u2013 it just seeds this stuff.\u201d He cites a scene in Christopher Nolan\u2019s Interstellar (2014) in which a schoolteacher informs Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character that the moon landings were hoaxed in order to win the propaganda war against the Soviet Union. \u201cIt\u2019s a throwaway in the film. But it really did churn up a big response.\u201d Oliver Morton, the author of The Moon: A History for the Future, believes the persistence of the moon hoax isn\u2019t surprising. Given an implausible event for which there is lots of evidence (Apollo 11) and a plausible event for which there is zero evidence (the moon hoax), some people will opt for the latter. \u201cThe point of Apollo was to show how powerful the American government was in terms of actually doing things,\u201d he says. \u201cThe point of moon-hoax theory is to show how powerful the American government was in terms of making people believe things that weren\u2019t true.\u201d But the hoax narrative was only really possible as Apollo never led anywhere \u2013 there were no further missions after 1972. \u201cAs the American mind turns back to paranoia in the 1970s, it becomes more pleasing to believe in this,\u201d he says. James Bond has to take a small share of the blame. In Diamonds Are Forever (1971), Sean Connery busts into a Nasa facility by way of a Las Vegas casino. A chase ensues across a film set dressed up to look like the moon, complete with earthbound astronauts. But here it\u2019s more like a visual joke, a way of justifying a moon buggy chase across the Nevada desert. By the time of Peter Hyams\u2019 Kaysingian conspiracy thriller Capricorn One (1978), the idea that the government was fooling everyone was no laughing matter. Here it\u2019s about a Mars mission that goes wrong. The authorities opt to fake it and kill the astronauts (one of whom is played by OJ Simpson) to prevent them revealing the truth. In the post-Watergate era, the idea that the government could lie on this scale had become much more plausible. Apollo marked a turning point between the optimism of the 60s and the disappointments of the 70s. \u201cWe can put a man on the moon so why can\u2019t we do X?\u201d became a common refrain. As Morton says: \u201cYes, the government can set itself an extraordinary goal and go on to achieve it, but that doesn\u2019t mean it can win the war in Vietnam, or clean up the inner cities, or cure cancer or any of the things that Americans might have actually wanted more. The idea that the government isn\u2019t really powerful, it just pretends it is \u2013 you can see how it feeds into the moon hoax.\u201d Moon-hoax theories tend to be about what didn\u2019t happen rather than what did. Conspiracists are divided on whether the earlier Apollo, Mercury, Gemini and Atlas missions were also fakes, whether Laika or Yuri Gagarin ever made it into space, and what role Kubrick played. But while the first generation of lunar conspiracists were motivated by anger, these days it\u2019s more likely to be boredom. The line between conspiracy and entertainment is far more blurry. Still, while irritating for those involved \u2013 Buzz Aldrin punched moon conspiracist Bart Sibrel in 2002 \u2013 in one sense the conspiracy idea is harmless, at least compared with misinformation about vaccinations or mass murders. Morton notes that it is one of the few conspiracy theories that isn\u2019t tainted by antisemitism. Nor does it seem to be one to which Donald Trump, the ultimate product of news-as-entertainment, subscribes. The dynamics of the modern internet have clearly not helped: look up Apollo videos on YouTube and before long moon-hoax documentaries start lining up in the autoplay queue. But there is little evidence that Russian disinformation agents have spread moon conspiracies as they have anti-vaxxing propaganda, for example. Although, if you think about it, it would make perfect sense for them to do so: a neat way of restoring Russian prestige while establishing continuity between the cold war and the information wars. Then again, the USSR had the means to expose the Americans at the time; it was listening in. \u201cWe were there at Soviet military base 32103,\u201d the Russian cosmonaut Alexei Leonov recently recalled. \u201cI swear to God we sat there with our fingers crossed. We hoped the guys would make it. We wanted this to happen. We knew those who were on board and they knew us, too.\u201d The growing strength of the hoax theory is \u201cone of the things that happens as time recedes and these events are lost\u201d, laments Launius. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen it with the second world war and the Holocaust. A lot of the witnesses are passing from the scene and it\u2019s easy for people to deny that it took place. Who is left to counteract things that are untrue? Mythologies develop and become the dominant theme.\u201d Perhaps the hardest thing to believe in is the idea that humans might have accomplished something transcendent \u2013 something that even brought out the best in Nixon. \u201cBecause of what you have done, the heavens have become part of man\u2019s world,\u201d he said in his telephone call to Aldrin and Armstrong on the moon. \u201cAnd as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth.\u201d We have less faith in ourselves these days. Most moon conspiracists treat the whole thing as a joke, a rabbit hole to go down from time to time. Perhaps if Nasa returns to the moon \u2013 possibly as early as 2024, depending on Trump\u2019s whims \u2013 it will be replaced in time by Mars conspiracies. Still, you could see the persistence of the moon conspiracy as a compliment to the Apollo scientists. \u201cIn a way, the moon hoaxers are taking the Apollo missions far more seriously than most people do,\u201d says Morton. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign that they really care. They think that Apollo really mattered.\u201d The truth is that the moon landings didn\u2019t really change life on Earth. Not yet anyway. \u2022 This article was amended on 10 and 11 July 2019. An earlier version said that Nasa launched Alan Shepard into orbit in May 1961. However, that flight was suborbital. In addition, Nasa was consuming more than 4% of the US federal budget in the 1960s, not more than 4% of the country\u2019s GDP as an earlier version said. This has been corrected.",

But she never wishes it was her on stage. \u201cAbsolutely not. Terrifying.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI was mediocre at best \u2026 This is the job I was meant to do.\u201d</p> <p>Everything the 31-year-old Moody touches seems to turn to gongs. Last year at Edinburgh she won Fringe Firsts for Gary McNair and Kieran Hurley\u2019s playground drama <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/07/square-go-review-roundabout-summerhall-edinburgh-fringe-festival\">Square Go</a> and Penelope Skinner\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/10/meek-traverse-theatre-angry-alan-underbelly-cowgate-review-edinburgh-fringe-festival\">Angry Alan</a>, a flaying of modern masculine entitlement. This year she is returning with Square Go and bringing Baby Reindeer, by Edinburgh comedy award winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/aug/22/richard-gadd-edinburgh-festival-fringe-comedy\">Richard Gadd</a>, and Do Our Best, a comedy about grief and Girl Guides.</p> <p>Born in London, Moody studied drama at Exeter University and did a master\u2019s in acting at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Producing happened by accident. A friend wanted to apply for funding from the now defunct IdeasTap, but wasn\u2019t under 25. Moody, nowhere near the age restriction, took the lead. She worked part time front of house at the Royal Opera House (\u201cpointing out where the loos were\u201d) and produced on the side. Jones, a contemporary at Royal Welsh, asked if she\u2019d help her and Waller-Bridge develop the repertoire of their company DryWrite from short-play nights to full-length plays. That led to Fleabag. She spent four years as a producer at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2014/oct/10/touring-theatre-paines-plough-regional-voices-local-writing\">Paines Plough</a>, a year as executive producer for Curious Directive, then went freelance with Francesca Moody Productions.</p> <p>I thought producing was meant to be the most stressful job in theatre so throw Moody questions about coping with pressure. She answers as if confused by the idea that any of it is that difficult. Perhaps it\u2019s a desire not to show fault, or maybe it\u2019s the comfort of Soho, which \u201cfeels like home\u201d. She\u2019s produced many shows here including, this month, Gabriel Bisset-Smith\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/08/whitewash-review-soho-theatre-london-gabriel-bisset-smith\">Whitewash</a>, about gentrification, housing and the decline of clubbing in London.</p> <p>Even in the theatrical hellscape of Edinburgh, Moody is not easily flustered. \u201cI went first when I was 17 and have been every year since, working in some capacity.\u201d There\u2019s a formula to it, she thinks. </p> <p>Step one: find the right play. \u201cI need a visceral reaction.\u201d She read <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/baby-reindeer-by-richard-gadd\">Baby Reindeer</a> on the train. \u201cIt pulled into the station and I had 10 pages to go. I just stayed on the train reading it. I couldn\u2019t bear not finishing.\u201d It\u2019s based on a true story about harassment and obsession. \u201cLike all good thrillers, it keeps you guessing.\u201d</p> <p>Step two: find the right venue. For Square Go in New York, they went with subscriber-based 59E59. The show was risky because \u201cit\u2019s just very Scottish\u201d but they got the audience to chant and cheer. \u201cAmericans love to do that.\u201d At the fringe, it is returning to Roundabout in Summerhall; the in-the-round theatre ideal for the boxing-ring setting. For debuts, size is key. <a href=\"https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/do-our-best\">Do Our Best</a> is by Remy Beasley. \u201cLike Phoebe, she\u2019s one of those people you just gravitate towards. She\u2019s an amazing storyteller, naturally funny, not afraid to be ugly on stage.\u201d It is at Ironbelly, a similar venue to where Fleabag was. \u201cSomewhere like Roundabout is too exposing for a first time. But 60 seats?\u201d She nods. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna make money, but you are gonna make reputations.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d2d98a45c234ce94a0b913b644bae4f9bc9a3f7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2d98a45c234ce94a0b913b644bae4f9bc9a3f7d/0_114_5760_3726/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In the round \u2026 Scott Fletcher and Gavin Jon Wright in Square Go.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the round \u2026 Scott Fletcher and Gavin Jon Wright in Square Go.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Step three: getting people in. \u201cEdinburgh\u2019s a great leveller and there\u2019s a captive audience.

Then you\u2019ve created the opportunities for that artist.\u201d</p> <p>Is it really that simple? \u201cThere have been some hairy moments,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve had to deal with difficult personalities and make unpopular decisions. When things go wrong, ultimately it ends with you,\u201d she hesitates, \u201ceven if it\u2019s not your fault. In those cases you need a thick skin.\u201d The biggest risk is always financial targets. \u201cEdinburgh can be a real slog when you\u2019re not getting audiences.

Terrifying.\u201d She laughs. \u201cI was mediocre at best \u2026 This is the job I was meant to do.\u201d Everything the 31-year-old Moody touches seems to turn to gongs. Last year at Edinburgh she won Fringe Firsts for Gary McNair and Kieran Hurley\u2019s playground drama Square Go and Penelope Skinner\u2019s Angry Alan, a flaying of modern masculine entitlement. This year she is returning with Square Go and bringing Baby Reindeer, by Edinburgh comedy award winner Richard Gadd, and Do Our Best, a comedy about grief and Girl Guides. Born in London, Moody studied drama at Exeter University and did a master\u2019s in acting at Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. Producing happened by accident. A friend wanted to apply for funding from the now defunct IdeasTap, but wasn\u2019t under 25. Moody, nowhere near the age restriction, took the lead. She worked part time front of house at the Royal Opera House (\u201cpointing out where the loos were\u201d) and produced on the side. Jones, a contemporary at Royal Welsh, asked if she\u2019d help her and Waller-Bridge develop the repertoire of their company DryWrite from short-play nights to full-length plays. That led to Fleabag. She spent four years as a producer at Paines Plough, a year as executive producer for Curious Directive, then went freelance with Francesca Moody Productions. I thought producing was meant to be the most stressful job in theatre so throw Moody questions about coping with pressure. She answers as if confused by the idea that any of it is that difficult. Perhaps it\u2019s a desire not to show fault, or maybe it\u2019s the comfort of Soho, which \u201cfeels like home\u201d. She\u2019s produced many shows here including, this month, Gabriel Bisset-Smith\u2019s Whitewash, about gentrification, housing and the decline of clubbing in London. Even in the theatrical hellscape of Edinburgh, Moody is not easily flustered. \u201cI went first when I was 17 and have been every year since, working in some capacity.\u201d There\u2019s a formula to it, she thinks. Step one: find the right play. \u201cI need a visceral reaction.\u201d She read Baby Reindeer on the train. \u201cIt pulled into the station and I had 10 pages to go. I just stayed on the train reading it. I couldn\u2019t bear not finishing.\u201d It\u2019s based on a true story about harassment and obsession. \u201cLike all good thrillers, it keeps you guessing.\u201d Step two: find the right venue. For Square Go in New York, they went with subscriber-based 59E59. The show was risky because \u201cit\u2019s just very Scottish\u201d but they got the audience to chant and cheer. \u201cAmericans love to do that.\u201d At the fringe, it is returning to Roundabout in Summerhall; the in-the-round theatre ideal for the boxing-ring setting. For debuts, size is key. Do Our Best is by Remy Beasley. \u201cLike Phoebe, she\u2019s one of those people you just gravitate towards. She\u2019s an amazing storyteller, naturally funny, not afraid to be ugly on stage.\u201d It is at Ironbelly, a similar venue to where Fleabag was. \u201cSomewhere like Roundabout is too exposing for a first time. But 60 seats?\u201d She nods. \u201cYou\u2019re not gonna make money, but you are gonna make reputations.\u201d Step three: getting people in. \u201cEdinburgh\u2019s a great leveller and there\u2019s a captive audience. You can get the Guardian critic to come and see it and you don\u2019t have to be someone people know. Here [in London] it\u2019s harder to do that \u2026 Get a really good PR. Get reviews in early. Then you\u2019ve created the opportunities for that artist.\u201d Is it really that simple? \u201cThere have been some hairy moments,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve had to deal with difficult personalities and make unpopular decisions. When things go wrong, ultimately it ends with you,\u201d she hesitates, \u201ceven if it\u2019s not your fault. In those cases you need a thick skin.\u201d The biggest risk is always financial targets. \u201cEdinburgh can be a real slog when you\u2019re not getting audiences. You\u2019d be hard pressed to find a producer who doesn\u2019t wake up occasionally in hot sweats wondering how they\u2019re going to get that last bit of money for the show.\u201d But she never lets this stress spill out. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge skill to not burden the rest of the creative team with the worries that go with the financial side,\u201d says McNair. \u201cShe kept all that stuff away.\u201d After years of trying to get Square Go picked up, Moody made it happen. \u201cSome people thought it was too weird,\u201d Hurley explains. \u201cBut she was just like, this is great, and we\u2019re going to make it.\u201d This time six years ago, Fleabag was still coming together. Last year, Square Go was getting its gloves fitted. \u201cI\u2019m one very small cog in the big Fleabag machine,\u201d Moody insists, \u201cbut it\u2019s amazing to know that something that started off as a tiny little show you made with your friends is suddenly in the West End.\u201d Preparing for the fringe, she\u2019s feeling hopeful \u2013 and not just for her own work. \u201cThe idea that an Edinburgh show could have that kind of success is more possible now Fleabag has made that journey.\u201d The Edinburgh festival runs from 2-26 August. Fleabag is at Wyndham\u2019s theatre, London, 20 August-14 September.",

This means 2.5 billion more city dwellers, with 90% of the uptake happening in Asia and Africa. Half of the urban area that will be needed hasn\u2019t been built yet. We would need scores more Delhis, Shanghais and Lagoses.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe sad thing is that we\u2019re going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth,\u201d says the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer of New York University. \u201cIf we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If you build a new city you don\u2019t have to relocate or work around existing roads, rivers, factories or houses</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>John Macomber</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t take a Nobel winner to see that many of the existing cities of Asia and Africa are simply not able to handle this onslaught of urbanisation. Cairo was built to house 1 million people, not the 20 million who live there today. Cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Lagos, Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro are crowded by rings of informal developments. Retrofitting these cities with modern infrastructure and utilities is more complicated and expensive than clearing out a swathe of land and starting all over again.</p> \n<p>As Macomber says: \u201cIf you build a new city you don\u2019t have to relocate or work around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. You also don\u2019t have to work around existing political processes, community groups, civic organisations \u2026 or even existing regulations and rules.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>\u2018A wild west atmosphere\u2019</strong></h2> \n<p>As well as being less complicated and cheaper than retrofitting old cities, building new cities is seen by many leaders as more profitable \u2013 and sexier. At the height of China\u2019s new city building boom in 2011, land sales accounted for roughly 74% of the revenue stream for the country\u2019s municipal governments and plots of urban construction land were <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/chinas-land-grab-epidemic-is-causing-more-wukan-style-protests/252757/\">selling at a 40-fold profit</a>. Emerging markets that are actively reconstructing themselves \u2013 both physically and in terms of their global image \u2013 tend to have economies that are driven by the real estate and construction sectors. For them, building an entirely new city is the pinnacle of projects.</p> \n<p>\u201cNeoliberalism and deregulation have created a wild west atmosphere that facilitates the circulation of footloose capital globally,\u201d says Sarah Moser, a geography professor at McGill University and the author of the upcoming Atlas of New Cities. \u201cIt is easier now than in previous decades to acquire vast tracts of land and to then use that land for any purpose, including urban and commercial.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae3f577da460576b6ab37ecaa889909c01c131ed\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae3f577da460576b6ab37ecaa889909c01c131ed/0_79_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A computer render of how Duqm in Oman is planned to look.

Architects such as KPF and Arup are drawing up attention-grabbing masterplans lined with skyscrapers, parks and shopping malls reminiscent of New York, London and Dubai. And big tech firms such as Cisco, Alibaba and Tencent are keen to provision these new cities with cutting edge IT networks and public surveillance gizmos.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The developer\u2019s goal is to maximise profits \u2026 There is not much money to be made in affordable family housing</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sarah Moser</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of $100bn (\u00a378bn), while the country\u2019s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/saudi-arabia-building-billion-mega-bigger-new-york-city-a8230731.html\">five times that</a>. Malaysia\u2019s Forest City had its price initially pegged at $100bn, while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking $161bn. Adding up the costs of more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment that can be measured in the trillions of dollars \u2013 but the returns are far from given.</p> \n<p>\u201cToo often a best-case scenario of potential economic rewards is presented and the project is rushed through when decision makers are on a utopian high,\u201d says Moser. \u201cThe reality is that new city projects can only move forward with massive loans, often from foreign banks, with no guarantee that the city will be profitable enough to repay the loans.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>New cities that work</strong></h2> \n<p>\u201cCities have to have a purpose,\u201d Macomber says. \u201cIt\u2019s a common mistake that has been made for centuries where a ruler will say \u2018Let\u2019s build some buildings and palaces and some things will happen\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s put up a couple big office buildings and now we\u2019re going to have a Dubai on the Indian Ocean\u2019. Not necessarily. The new cities that struggle are the ones that are pushing against what market forces want to do.\u201d</p> \n<p>New cities that work have built-in economic drivers that give them their impetus and reason for being.

We\u2019ll just not let any poor people come here.\u2019 Those things are doomed to fail.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re also an inappropriate response to the real need, which is not for the rich to have a place to retreat to but for people who want to get a first position on the kind of urban, modern escalator that can help lift them and their kids to a better life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many new cities that are currently being built in Asia and Africa are clearly being designed for emerging middle classes. If provided with the right opportunities, this well-educated, big spending and highly mobile sector of society can be a boon for just about any country. If those opportunities are not provided they are especially prone to flight \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/08/27/what-educated-people-from-poor-countries-make-of-the-brain-drain-argument\">emigrating to better jobs and lifestyles</a> in the US, Canada and western Europe.</p> \n<p>The new city building boom is nearly as much about maintaining and attracting high-value talent as it is about creating space for the droves of rural migrants searching for their first handholds in an urban environment.</p> \n<p>\u201cMany new cities are scrambling to attract these global elites through creating luxury properties that they can buy, luxury retail and restaurants, and infrastructure for their lavish hobbies: particularly docking facilities for yachts,\u201d says Moser.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe developer\u2019s goal is to maximise profits and this is done in large part by creating luxury condos and villas. There is not much money to be made in affordable family housing, so developers are not interested.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Wade Shepard is the author of Ghost Cities of China, and On the New Silk Road</em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/guardiancities/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> to join the discussion, catch up on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities\">our best stories</a> or sign up for our <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/may/03/sign-up-for-the-cityscape-the-best-of-guardian-cities-every-week\">weekly newsletter</a></em></p>",

City building itself can also be a highly profitable endeavour for some. At first glance, many new cities appear to openly defy economic fundamentals. What are emerging markets \u2013 \u201cpoor countries\u201d \u2013 doing building some of the most technologically advanced, expensive cities on earth? Why is the dusty, remote Kazakh border town of Khorgos turning into what is claimed will become a \u201cnew Dubai\u201d? How come oil-dependent Oman is erecting Duqm \u2013 a metropolis twice the size of Singapore \u2013 in the middle of the desert? \u201cThe major reason for new cities is that there is so much migration,\u201d says John Macomber, a senior lecturer at Harvard Business School who has studied new city development in depth. \u201cPeople are moving to cities all over the world to seek opportunity.\u201d According to the UN, 68% of the world\u2019s population will be living in cities by 2050. This means 2.5 billion more city dwellers, with 90% of the uptake happening in Asia and Africa. Half of the urban area that will be needed hasn\u2019t been built yet. We would need scores more Delhis, Shanghais and Lagoses. \u201cThe sad thing is that we\u2019re going to develop more urban area in the next 100 years than currently exists on Earth,\u201d says the Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Romer of New York University. \u201cIf we stick to business as usual most of it is going to be disorderly and less functional than the stuff we already have.\u201d It doesn\u2019t take a Nobel winner to see that many of the existing cities of Asia and Africa are simply not able to handle this onslaught of urbanisation. Cairo was built to house 1 million people, not the 20 million who live there today. Cities such as Mumbai, Kolkata, Lagos, Nairobi and Rio de Janeiro are crowded by rings of informal developments. Retrofitting these cities with modern infrastructure and utilities is more complicated and expensive than clearing out a swathe of land and starting all over again. As Macomber says: \u201cIf you build a new city you don\u2019t have to relocate or work around existing roads or rivers or factories or houses. You also don\u2019t have to work around existing political processes, community groups, civic organisations \u2026 or even existing regulations and rules.\u201d \u2018A wild west atmosphere\u2019 As well as being less complicated and cheaper than retrofitting old cities, building new cities is seen by many leaders as more profitable \u2013 and sexier. At the height of China\u2019s new city building boom in 2011, land sales accounted for roughly 74% of the revenue stream for the country\u2019s municipal governments and plots of urban construction land were selling at a 40-fold profit. Emerging markets that are actively reconstructing themselves \u2013 both physically and in terms of their global image \u2013 tend to have economies that are driven by the real estate and construction sectors. For them, building an entirely new city is the pinnacle of projects. \u201cNeoliberalism and deregulation have created a wild west atmosphere that facilitates the circulation of footloose capital globally,\u201d says Sarah Moser, a geography professor at McGill University and the author of the upcoming Atlas of New Cities. \u201cIt is easier now than in previous decades to acquire vast tracts of land and to then use that land for any purpose, including urban and commercial. \u201cTechnology companies, construction companies, and the real estate industry are leveraging the many challenges facing cities in the global south to convince people that new cities are an important solution rather than fixing existing cities, which is not as profitable.\u201d Development firms such as New York\u2019s Gale International and South Korea\u2019s Posco are peddling copies of Songdo LINK around the world. Architects such as KPF and Arup are drawing up attention-grabbing masterplans lined with skyscrapers, parks and shopping malls reminiscent of New York, London and Dubai. And big tech firms such as Cisco, Alibaba and Tencent are keen to provision these new cities with cutting edge IT networks and public surveillance gizmos. The money being thrown at new cities is staggering. Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Abdullah Economic City comes at a price tag of $100bn (\u00a378bn), while the country\u2019s Neom megalopolis is slated to cost five times that. Malaysia\u2019s Forest City had its price initially pegged at $100bn, while Ordos Kangbashi cost a hulking $161bn. Adding up the costs of more than 120 new cities around the world means a mountain of investment that can be measured in the trillions of dollars \u2013 but the returns are far from given. \u201cToo often a best-case scenario of potential economic rewards is presented and the project is rushed through when decision makers are on a utopian high,\u201d says Moser. \u201cThe reality is that new city projects can only move forward with massive loans, often from foreign banks, with no guarantee that the city will be profitable enough to repay the loans.\u201d New cities that work \u201cCities have to have a purpose,\u201d Macomber says. \u201cIt\u2019s a common mistake that has been made for centuries where a ruler will say \u2018Let\u2019s build some buildings and palaces and some things will happen\u2019 or \u2018Let\u2019s put up a couple big office buildings and now we\u2019re going to have a Dubai on the Indian Ocean\u2019. Not necessarily. The new cities that struggle are the ones that are pushing against what market forces want to do.\u201d New cities that work have built-in economic drivers that give them their impetus and reason for being. Khorgos on the China-Kazakhstan border was sparked to life by a transportation hub along the New Silk Road; Cyberjaya in Malaysia was built as a concentrated hub of hi-tech firms, startups and educational facilities; South Korea\u2019s Songdo is one of the best examples of an \u201caerotropolis\u201d \u2013 a city built around an airport. Other new cities could be described as superfluous \u2013 custom-built cities for the rich. \u201cSome of these developments are imagined as the gated communities of privilege,\u201d says Romer. \u201cLike Bras\u00edlia: \u2018The place where we will be able to drive really fast in our cars. We\u2019ll just not let any poor people come here.\u2019 Those things are doomed to fail. \u201cThey\u2019re also an inappropriate response to the real need, which is not for the rich to have a place to retreat to but for people who want to get a first position on the kind of urban, modern escalator that can help lift them and their kids to a better life.\u201d Many new cities that are currently being built in Asia and Africa are clearly being designed for emerging middle classes. If provided with the right opportunities, this well-educated, big spending and highly mobile sector of society can be a boon for just about any country. If those opportunities are not provided they are especially prone to flight \u2013 emigrating to better jobs and lifestyles in the US, Canada and western Europe. The new city building boom is nearly as much about maintaining and attracting high-value talent as it is about creating space for the droves of rural migrants searching for their first handholds in an urban environment. \u201cMany new cities are scrambling to attract these global elites through creating luxury properties that they can buy, luxury retail and restaurants, and infrastructure for their lavish hobbies: particularly docking facilities for yachts,\u201d says Moser. \u201cThe developer\u2019s goal is to maximise profits and this is done in large part by creating luxury condos and villas. There is not much money to be made in affordable family housing, so developers are not interested.\u201d Wade Shepard is the author of Ghost Cities of China, and On the New Silk Road Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter",

I never gave this much thought until I returned to Scandinavia after living overseas for several years, and saw how all my female friends and colleagues who had started families were limiting their professional careers and slipping into gender roles reminiscent of past generations. Given that they had the freedom to choose, what explained the fact those traditional gender roles were so entrenched? And why was it that, despite having one of the world\u2019s most gender-equal systems, mothers were not re-entering the workforce at the same rate as men after parental leave? Could it be that a welfare system taking care of material needs had paradoxically produced a degree of complacency that allowed outmoded, conservative social expectations to prosper?</p> <p>In a safe, stable and wealthy country such as Sweden, conforming comes naturally. Things work well if you follow the line. The Swedes have a word for this: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/lagom-sweden-hygge-lifestyle-trends\" title=\"\">\u201c<em>lagom</em>\u201d</a>: neither too much nor too little of anything. Government policies allow for flexibility in how couples decide to use postnatal benefits: while both parents are entitled to 240 days\u2019 leave, 90 of those days are earmarked as a minimum for each parent, and the remaining 150 days can be transferred to the other parent upon consent. This is where traditional expectations seem to come into play. According to a report in the Nordic Labour Journal, <a href=\"http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/i-fokus/in-focus-2018/nordic-working-life/article.2018-06-14.5410895249\" title=\"\">mothers often take</a> the majority of that flexible leave. There seem to be two reasons for this: traditional gender dynamics within couples, and corporate expectations in which workplaces pressure fathers to take only those weeks specifically allotted to them.</p> <p>So while family-friendly policies make Sweden stand out, they do not guarantee a more progressive view of a woman\u2019s place in society. And with current politics being influenced by rightwing forces, there is a trend towards returning \u201ctraditional family values\u201d to the fore, as if preserving national pride hinged on this. Against that backdrop, there is a risk that rights once thought well protected might be reversed.</p> <p>One way of preventing a traditional division of roles from becoming further embedded could be to simply change policies. Anne Lise Ellings\u00e6ter, a professor at Oslo University, has argued for a dual parental leave model: parents of a newborn baby would be provided with an equal number of weeks, none of which would be transferable. But limiting flexibility might also mean limiting people\u2019s ability to choose what is right for them. Instead, perhaps we need to look at educating families in gender equality, rather than taking choices away from them. Providing information about the benefits of equally divided parental leave, childcare and duties in the home would be a more sustainable solution.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/22/this-is-europe-sign-up-guardian-email-updates\">This is Europe: stay close with the Guardian\u2019s email updates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because their country is so often cast in a positive light on social issues, many Swedes find it difficult to express dissatisfaction, for fear of sounding ungrateful. This leaves us with a catch-22 situation, where the inequalities that exist are brushed to one side and never debated, because \u201cwe\u2019re lucky enough with things as they are\u201d.</p> <p>Yet change is happening at a grassroots level. I recently came across a set of Swedish-language Instagram accounts dedicated to educating women (and men) about equality, family life and gender norms. One such account, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mansbebisar/?hl=en\" title=\"\">@mansbebisar</a> (translation: man babies) has gained a following of more than 70,000 people in just 18 months since its launch. The posts make it clear that Swedish households are anything but equal: women still take on the majority of the workload in the home, care for their children and project-manage the family. They also shed light on how taking up the bulk of parental leave means women find themselves financially disadvantaged \u2013 a frequent topic in social media discussions.</p> <p>Accounts such as these help women and men understand how they need to change. It\u2019s as if progress was being mapped out by digital communities before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 reaching the political realm. There\u2019s no denying family policies are better in Sweden than in many other countries. But to think there\u2019s no room for improvement would be foolish. The Swedish model shouldn\u2019t be seen as perfect, but rather as a good indicator both of what works and what steps still need to be taken on the long journey towards a truly gender-equal society.</p> <p>\u2022 Madelaine Gnewski is a Swedish journalist based in Copenhagen</p>",

One way of preventing a traditional division of roles from becoming further embedded could be to simply change policies. Anne Lise Ellings\u00e6ter, a professor at Oslo University, has argued for a dual parental leave model: parents of a newborn baby would be provided with an equal number of weeks, none of which would be transferable. But limiting flexibility might also mean limiting people\u2019s ability to choose what is right for them. Instead, perhaps we need to look at educating families in gender equality, rather than taking choices away from them. Providing information about the benefits of equally divided parental leave, childcare and duties in the home would be a more sustainable solution. Because their country is so often cast in a positive light on social issues, many Swedes find it difficult to express dissatisfaction, for fear of sounding ungrateful. This leaves us with a catch-22 situation, where the inequalities that exist are brushed to one side and never debated, because \u201cwe\u2019re lucky enough with things as they are\u201d. Yet change is happening at a grassroots level. I recently came across a set of Swedish-language Instagram accounts dedicated to educating women (and men) about equality, family life and gender norms. One such account, @mansbebisar (translation: man babies) has gained a following of more than 70,000 people in just 18 months since its launch. The posts make it clear that Swedish households are anything but equal: women still take on the majority of the workload in the home, care for their children and project-manage the family. They also shed light on how taking up the bulk of parental leave means women find themselves financially disadvantaged \u2013 a frequent topic in social media discussions. Accounts such as these help women and men understand how they need to change. It\u2019s as if progress was being mapped out by digital communities before \u2013 hopefully \u2013 reaching the political realm. There\u2019s no denying family policies are better in Sweden than in many other countries. But to think there\u2019s no room for improvement would be foolish. The Swedish model shouldn\u2019t be seen as perfect, but rather as a good indicator both of what works and what steps still need to be taken on the long journey towards a truly gender-equal society. \u2022 Madelaine Gnewski is a Swedish journalist based in Copenhagen",

And maybe it\u2019ll work. Maybe Secret Obsession will become a sensation as a result. Maybe it\u2019ll even push people towards watching My Teacher, My Obsession like they deserve. But it\u2019ll leave a weird taste in everyone\u2019s mouth if it does.",

      "bodyText": "Water companies in England have been warned to clean up their act after the environment watchdog described their performance last year as \u201csimply unacceptable\u201d. Southern Water and Yorkshire Water were singled out for high levels of serious pollution incidents, where sewage is discharged into bathing water. Both companies and South West Water only achieved a two-star rating from the Environment Agency (EA), which it said reflected an \u201cunacceptable level of performance\u201d. The EA assessment of the nine privatised water and sewerage companies in England said only one \u2013 Northumbrian Water \u2013 was performing at the level required. Emma Howard Boyd, the EA chair, said: \u201cPerformance in 2018 was simply unacceptable \u2026 rather than improving, the performance of most companies has deteriorated, reversing the trend of gradual improvement since we introduced the environmental performance assessment in 2011. \u201cSerious pollution incidents which damage the local environment, threaten wildlife and in the worst cases put the public at risk have increased.\u201d Although the report assessed performance last year, Howard Boyd said nothing she had seen so far this year suggested any of the companies were making dramatic improvements. She said the agency was toughening its inspections and increasing its audits of water firms as a result of their poor performance. On Tuesday the water regulator Ofwat announced measures that could restrict shareholder payouts if the companies were found not to be financially resilient. Four companies \u2013 Severn Trent, Southern Water, Wessex Water and Yorkshire Water \u2013 had increased numbers of serious pollution incidents compared with 2017. \u201cThere needs to be a significant improvement by the sector to meet our expectations for both serious and total pollution incidents,\u201d the report said. Southern has been heavily criticised for its performance in the past and is at the centre of a criminal investigation by the EA over failures at a sewage treatment plant that polluted rivers and beaches in southern England. The company was fined \u00a3126m last month by Ofwat over the failures, which the watchdog described as \u201cshocking.\u201d Last week the campaign group Surfers Against Sewage released data that showed Southern had polluted some of Britain\u2019s most visited beaches with raw sewage and storm water more than 150 times in six weeks. The EA report also criticised South West Water for poor performance, giving it a red rating for pollution incidents. The report said: \u201cWe expect companies to prevent serious pollution incidents \u2026 [which] lead to the release of harmful substances into air, land or water, and some can cause significant harm to the environment.\u201d Category one incidents have a serious extensive or persistent impact on the environment, people or property and may, for example, result in a large number of fish deaths. Category two incidents have a lesser but significant impact. In 2018, the number of serious pollution incidents (categories one and two) increased to 56 from 52, with 48 of them involving the companies\u2019 sewage networks and sewage treatment works. The water companies are unlikely to meet targets to move towards reducing serious pollution incidents to zero by next year. Dr Toby Willison, the executive director of operations at the EA, said: \u201cWater companies need to clean up their act. People expect water companies to improve the environment, not pollute rivers. \u201cWe will continue to challenge CEOs to improve company performance and we will take strong and appropriate enforcement action.\u201d Yorkshire Water said the increase in its serious pollution incidents was \u201cabsolutely not reflective of the company\u2019s ambition to protect the environment\u201d and fell \u201cfar short of the standards required to meet our aim to be recognised as an industry leader\u201d. The company said it had taken measures to turn around its performance. Southern said: \u201cThere has been a complete step change in our pollutions team over the past two years and this is reflected in the far higher level of self-reporting as new systems and processes kick in. \u201cWe know we have more to do. More awareness training for staff means we are now finding and fixing issues sooner and an improvement programme at all of our high-impact sites is making good progress.\u201d",

Her death, on 8 April 2015, became the last recorded death from measles in the United States. At the time, no one had perished from measles in 12 years. Now, as a record-setting measles outbreak spreads in 28 states, with the majority of cases in New York, her death shows how preventable diseases can devastate families far outside the communities which choose to delay or decline vaccines. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Montantes\u2019s mother, Ralphenia Knudson, describes how the disease, often called \u201charmless\u201d by anti-vaxxers, claimed her daughter\u2019s life and upended her family. \u201cYou don\u2019t have a right to play with other people\u2019s lives like that, you don\u2019t get to choose \u2013 \u2018OK we\u2019ll let it run its course, we\u2019ll make them tough\u2019,\u201d Knudson said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to make them tough, you\u2019re exposing them to a deadly virus their body won\u2019t be able to fight and that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Montantes was the first person to die of measles in the US since 2003.

Vaccine hesitancy was named a top 10 global health threat by the World Health Organization this year. By this April, measles cases had risen 300%. In its decision to call vaccine hesitancy a global health threat, the WHO attributed the virus\u2019s rise, in part, to people declining or delaying vaccines despite their availability. Although reasons to decline vaccines are often multi-faceted, in the United States the rise of misinformation spread through social media by anti-vaxxers has played a prominent role in one of the worst measles outbreaks in nearly a decade. Most of the cases are concentrated in conservative Orthodox Jewish communities in and around New York City. Prominent anti-vaxxers, who have targeted a close-knit Somali community in Minnesota, have visited the city to spread propaganda and false claims about the dangers of vaccines. Unvaccinated children and those with suppressed immune systems \u2013 like Montantes \u2013 are the most vulnerable to measles, which kills between one and two people for every 1,000 it infects. The virus can also cause brain inflammation, called encephalitis, and permanent brain damage at about the same rate.

Stroud may have started tackling its emissions earlier than most, but Nottingham is arguably the most ambitious council, having set a target for the whole city to be carbon neutral by 2028. It has met the previous target of cutting CO2 emissions by a quarter by 2020 two years early.

A workplace parking levy on employers providing 11 or more parking spaces for staff generates \u00a39m a year, which is ringfenced for renewable transport schemes and has already paid for the city\u2019s new tram system. The trams are powered by the council\u2019s not-for-profit energy company, which supplies all its electricity from renewable sources.

Oxford city council, meanwhile, is holding a citizens\u2019 assembly to shape its action plan.

It will also be trialling what it believes is the world\u2019s largest hybrid battery to power ground-source heat pumps serving around 300 homes and increase electric vehicle-charging capability.

Green party councillor Carla Denyer, who proposed the climate emergency motion, welcomes the decision to introduce an annual carbon budget and to set a tougher carbon neutrality target but criticises the lack of concrete detail. \u201cEight months after full council declared a climate emergency, this is still a plan to produce a plan,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need an end to the \u2018business as usual\u2019 approach, replaced with rapid and ambitious action, and unfortunately there isn\u2019t enough of that in this report.\u201d",

On Wednesday the counsel assisting the inquest, Peggy Dwyer, revealed that a preliminary toxicological report for Hoang Tran, 18, known to his family as Nathan, who died after attending the Knockout Circuz in Sydney in December 2017, had revealed \u201ctrace\u201d elements of the drug PMA. PMA \u2013 the common name for paramethoxyamphetamine \u2013 is similar to, but more dangerous than, MDMA. Usually sold in pill form, those who take it often believe they are taking ecstasy or MDMA. The drug\u2019s effects can be similar, but often take longer to be felt, which means users sometimes take more of the substance in the belief the initial pill has not worked. Although it surfaces only intermittently in Australia, it has been linked to a number of deaths in the country and worldwide. In 2007 20-year-old Annabel Catt died after taking two MDMA caps at the Good Vibrations festival in Sydney. Later tests showed they contained PMA. In the UK the substance was directly linked to spike in drug-related deaths in 2012 and 2013. On Wednesday Dwyer told the inquest that while the initial toxicological report for Tran initially revealed only MDMA in his system, a later test undertaken by a lab in Western Australia revealed trace elements of PMA. The officer in charge of the investigation into the events leading up to Tran\u2019s death at the festival, Christopher Vavayis, told the inquiry he was not aware of the result. While the result is only preliminary, and revealed only a trace amount of the drug in Tran\u2019s system, Guardian Australia understands the inquest intends to ask the WA lab to investigate whether it can determine what the level of the drug may have been at the time of his death. The inquest had previously heard that Tran had shared a 600ml bottle of water mixed with MDMA with friends leading into the event. Friends of Tran\u2019s had told police they believed he had purchased four additional capsules of MDMA while at the event, but Vavayis said police had been unable to confirm that amount. \u201cI think that might go back to people not feeling comfortable divulging everything they knew to police,\u201d Vavayis told the inquest. The inquest has heard that while Tran\u2019s friends had told police that he was acting \u201clovey-dovey\u201d and \u201csmiling and having a good time\u201d earlier in the event, witnesses later said he was acting \u201cerratically and aggressively\u201d in the lead-up to his death, which was \u201cout of character\u201d. The deputy state coroner Harriet Grahame is examining the drug-related deaths of six young people at NSW music festivals between December 2017 and January 2019. Besides Tran, the inquest is also examining the deaths of Diana Nguyen, Joseph Pham, Callum Brosnan, Joshua Tam and Alex Ross-King, who all died from MDMA toxicity or complications of MDMA use.

On Wednesday Simon Coffey, the director of Q-Dance, said in view of his experience of similar events overseas the police presence in NSW was \u201cvery high-profile\u201d and could stop young people seeking help while at festivals. \u201cIf a young people goes to a music event and they see a wall of police, drug dogs and riot police and they decide to ingest drugs even before or after that it\u2019s a very intimidating experience for young people,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that young person is on drugs and they need help because they don\u2019t feel well I just wonder \u2026 I don\u2019t think they feel confident going up to a police person because they might feel scared they\u2019ll go to jail.\u201d On Monday the inquest heard that 19-year-old Ross-King, who died after attending the Fomo festival in Parramatta in January, had taken a higher amount of MDMA because she was fearful of being caught with the drug by police.

Coffey said Q-Dance had put all of its events on hold while it awaited the inquest findings, but it had made plans to significantly increase the number of medical staff at the events. He also said future events would start later to avoid the heat, and would not sell full-strength alcohol. \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning \u201cIt was a shock to the whole company worldwide,\u201d he said of Pham and Nguyen\u2019s death. \u201cMany people who run these festivals are in their 40s and have children, including myself who has a 21-year-old who goes to music festivals. \u201cIt was a freak situation and it was absolutely devastating.

An ambulance wasn\u2019t ready to take him to Nepean hospital until after 8.30pm. He conceded there was a lack of coordination between NSW ambulance and the on-site medical staff, and that \u201ca second set of hands\u201d for each patient would have made him feel more comfortable. On Wednesday Coffey said he had not talked to EMS about the number of doctors at the event, or their experience levels. \u201cYou relied entirely on [EMS] to determine the quality of the medical staff?\u201d counsel assisting Peggy Dwyer asked him. \u201cYes, like I had done every year,\u201d he replied.",

      "bodyText": "A flying congregation had assembled by the church gate. We approached on foot, coming on the coffin route, a straight path through fields along which pall bearers had once carried the dead from the nearby village of Ridgmont. Mourners might have walked through this meadow after the hay had been cut, as we did, and looked down at the grass laid out in strips to dry where it fell. Did a passage from the Bible come to mind? \u201cAll people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall.\u201d Any thoughts of death were soon dispelled by a flock of house martins scything through life. Why they had chosen to gather close to the churchyard quickly became apparent. Tractor wheels had churned out a shallow three-metre trench at the entrance to the next field and it was half full of water. The birds were stacked in the air above this trough of mud like aircraft over a runway, and they took turns to swoop down and skim its surface for insects. Never had I seen house martins showing such forbearance and cooperation in feeding. After I had stood to count a sixth swoop and pass, the whole flock rose and veered off over the church tower, as if the last trench prospector had said: \u201cNothing here, guys. Move on.\u201d At a layby on the lane, a woman was unloading her car boot and I carried a tray of begonias for her through the church gate. She told me she was decorating her late father\u2019s grave and made for a cluster of neat rectangular plots among close-trimmed grass. Over to the left, a house of God was open to heaven, the church roof long gone, graceful windowless arches partly framed with fragile remnants of wooden tracery. I stepped in through a doorway without a door, down an earth floor nave, then exited through a narrower doorway in the chancel. A carefully mown path led through a wildflower meadow, where grasses grew tall among the graves of long-forgotten parishioners and the old stones now bloomed all year round with the yellows, greys, greens and whites of lichens.",

Anyone who was deprived of their German citizenship during the 12 years of Nazi dictatorship on political, racial or religious grounds \u2013 as well as their descendants \u2013 is potentially eligible for its restoration, according to a clause enshrined in the country\u2019s constitution. But several hundred applicants, some of whom submitted claims from the UK after the EU referendum, have been turned down, most commonly on the basis that applications are only valid if citizenship has been passed through the father. Other exclusions have been made on the grounds that the qualifying ancestor lost his or her citizenship having escaped Germany after the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, but before being officially stripped of it by the Nazis in 1941, meaning they are classified in legal terms as having relinquished their citizenship of their own free will. The Guardian has heard the detailed stories of 12 people who are seeking answers from the German government after their applications were turned down. Barbara Hanley\u2019s German-Jewish grandfather fled to the UK in 1938 after Kristallnacht, but her application was turned down due to \u201cthe patriarchal logic that \u2026 my mother married an Englishman and I was born in 1945 \u2013 at which time nationality could only be conferred through the father\u201d. \u201cI am extremely angry about this appalling unfairness,\u201d said Hanley, who wrote to the Guardian about her case in June 2017. \u201cThe German state, if it is to be taken seriously in its claims to have come to terms with the past, needs to swiftly act to amend this injustice.\u201d The anger and dismay caused by the growing number of rejections has prompted the creation of the Article 116 Exclusions Group, a UK-based campaign group that takes its name from the article of Germany\u2019s basic law that provides for the restoration of citizenship.

      "bodyText": "The former West Australian premier Geoff Gallop has called for a ban on donors paying for one-on-one ministerial access and for the real-time publication of the diaries of politicians, staffers and senior public servants. Gallop said the integrity and transparency reforms were needed for governments to regain public trust and win back \u201cthe respect of the nation\u201d. The former premier, now emeritus professor at the University of Sydney, has become a vocal campaigner for integrity reform at both federal and state level. Gallop recently submitted to the New South Wales independent commission against corruption that the publication of diaries in NSW should be extended beyond ministers to include all politicians, senior staffers and bureaucrats. The diaries should also be published in real time, rather than every three months, giving the public an ability to immediately see who is lobbying those in power. Gallop told Guardian Australia such reforms were also critical at a federal level, where there is no requirement to publish ministerial diaries or detail contacts with lobbyists. \u201cA lot of the activity in this area is in and around the ministerial office,\u201d Gallop said. \u201cIf you just think about it from a practical point of view, the minister is going into parliament, he or she has to answer questions, they have to prepare for that. They have electorates, they have to go out and spend time in their electorate. they\u2019re very busy people. \u201cOne of the reasons that we have ministerial offices is a reflection that [ministers] can\u2019t do everything, they have people delegated to carry out stakeholder engagement \u2026 so they have to be a part of [transparency reforms].\u201d Gallop said lobbying was a normal and unavoidable part of a democratic society. But he said those in public life must accept their activities should be open to scrutiny. \u201cPoliticians, given the concern about inequality of power in our society, have to accept they have to be transparent about who they meet, with details recorded through proper minutes,\u201d Gallop told Guardian Australia. The former premier has also called for an end to donors paying for one-on-one access to ministers. He said such arrangements were at odds with fundamental democratic concepts. Gallop\u2019s calls echo those of one of Queensland\u2019s most respected corruption fighters, Prof Ken Wiltshire, who last month called for cash-for-access to be banned. \u201cThis kind of behaviour has led to much corruption in Queensland and led directly to the establishment of the Fitzgerald inquiry, which recommended the banning of such practices,\u201d Wiltshire was quoted as saying in the Courier-Mail. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Gallop said any efforts to improve lobbying rules at a federal level would be pointless without a functioning integrity commission. He said breaches of the rules must be held to account, and that could only be done by an investigative body with appropriate powers. \u201cIf you haven\u2019t got a body that can go in deep and find out what\u2019s actually going on, all of the lobbying rules won\u2019t be enough,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the end you\u2019ve got to know that there\u2019s going to be that accountability.\u201d",

Namibians love to eat meat, and he is no exception: his tribe, the Herero, traditionally eat nothing else.</p> \n<p>But regulation is patchy and the meat being sold at this market could contain anything from antibiotics to parasites, Haakuria says.

But starting next year, it will offer a postgraduate specialist course on the subject. It is only the second such course in the world. The first opened its doors at the <a href=\"https://www.harper-adams.ac.uk/\">UK\u2019s Harper Adams University</a> a decade ago.</p> \n<p>\u201cPart of the training will be around animal health and husbandry,\u201d says Alison Pyatt, who runs Harper Adams\u2019s postgraduate course, and who is helping to set up its Namibian counterpart. Graduates from these courses do not replace vets, she explains. But they are able to go out into farming communities and advise people on how to keep their animals, and themselves, healthy.</p> \n<p>In Namibia, that means teaching people about naturally occurring diseases such as brucellosis, a bacterial infection passed from animals through milk, meat or even close contact, which can cause miscarriages in humans.</p> \n<p>Haakuria and Pyatt both believe pharmacists are ideally placed to supplement veterinary health services in rural areas. The medicines used to treat humans and animals are often the same, he says, and pharmacists are experts on how to give drugs safely and effectively. This is something vets don\u2019t always know how to do. And anyway, in northern Namibia vets are in short supply. But most towns have a pharmacist.</p> \n<p>Veterinary pharmacists would provide drugs, advice and information to rural communities, Haakuria explains. But they could also help curb drug resistance. Overuse of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in agriculture is one of the main culprits driving the development of superbugs around the world. So if stores that dispense them in rural parts of the country are required to have specially trained staff, that would be a big step forward, he says.</p> \n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to stop with Namibia, he adds. \u201cIf it works here it needs only a little bit of tweaking to work in, say, Botswana.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking to the students, it seems at least some of them are keen to follow in Haakuria\u2019s footsteps. Nearly all of them grew up around animals and have seen the issues Haakuria describes with their own eyes.</p> \n<p>One of them, Venomuinjo Kasaona from Opuwo, a town near the border with Angola, remembers eating meat as a child from an animal that he realises now had probably died of foot and mouth disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cI realise I can help people back home,\u201d he says.</p> \n<p><em>This article is part of a series on possible solutions to stubborn problems.

      "bodyText": "Wreathed in barbecue smoke, Vetjaera Haakuria gestures at the men butchering meat and cooking it over hot coals behind his back. \u201cWhat have you learned about the risks of eating this?\u201d he asks his young audience, spotless in their white lab coats. \u201cIt might contain drug residues, right? And what about diseases?\u201d It\u2019s nearly noon in Windhoek, Namibia\u2019s capital, and the market is preparing grilled meat \u2013 known locally as kapana \u2013 for the lunchtime rush. Everyone comes here, from construction workers to members of parliament. Namibians love to eat meat, and he is no exception: his tribe, the Herero, traditionally eat nothing else. But regulation is patchy and the meat being sold at this market could contain anything from antibiotics to parasites, Haakuria says. Diseases that pass from livestock to humans are rife in the country\u2019s rural north. Animals that die from unknown causes are eaten, no questions asked. Last year more than 50 people were hospitalised in north-western Namibia after contracting anthrax, a deadly disease that had probably entered a goat flock from infected wildlife. In those areas, people live cheek by jowl with their livestock, Haakuria says. \u201cYou go straight from the cattle kraal into the house, where babies crawl around on the floor.\u201d While most small-scale farmers are able to access basic veterinary drugs such as antibiotics and dewormers over the counter at agri-stores or human pharmacies, few are told how to administer them safely. That is why Haakuria has brought his second-year pharmacy students from the University of Namibia to this market: to teach them about the interface between human and animal health. He is the country\u2019s only specialist veterinary pharmacist. But not for long \u2013 or so he hopes. The University of Namibia teaches all its pharmacy students a bit of veterinary pharmacy. But starting next year, it will offer a postgraduate specialist course on the subject. It is only the second such course in the world. The first opened its doors at the UK\u2019s Harper Adams University a decade ago. \u201cPart of the training will be around animal health and husbandry,\u201d says Alison Pyatt, who runs Harper Adams\u2019s postgraduate course, and who is helping to set up its Namibian counterpart. Graduates from these courses do not replace vets, she explains. But they are able to go out into farming communities and advise people on how to keep their animals, and themselves, healthy. In Namibia, that means teaching people about naturally occurring diseases such as brucellosis, a bacterial infection passed from animals through milk, meat or even close contact, which can cause miscarriages in humans. Haakuria and Pyatt both believe pharmacists are ideally placed to supplement veterinary health services in rural areas. The medicines used to treat humans and animals are often the same, he says, and pharmacists are experts on how to give drugs safely and effectively. This is something vets don\u2019t always know how to do. And anyway, in northern Namibia vets are in short supply. But most towns have a pharmacist. Veterinary pharmacists would provide drugs, advice and information to rural communities, Haakuria explains. But they could also help curb drug resistance. Overuse of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics in agriculture is one of the main culprits driving the development of superbugs around the world. So if stores that dispense them in rural parts of the country are required to have specially trained staff, that would be a big step forward, he says. It doesn\u2019t have to stop with Namibia, he adds. \u201cIf it works here it needs only a little bit of tweaking to work in, say, Botswana.\u201d Speaking to the students, it seems at least some of them are keen to follow in Haakuria\u2019s footsteps. Nearly all of them grew up around animals and have seen the issues Haakuria describes with their own eyes. One of them, Venomuinjo Kasaona from Opuwo, a town near the border with Angola, remembers eating meat as a child from an animal that he realises now had probably died of foot and mouth disease. \u201cI realise I can help people back home,\u201d he says.

A cold front will bring rain, hail and snow, with severe weather and flood warnings issued for all three states. Damaging winds \u2013 from 80km/h to 120km/h \u2013 will also hit affected areas. In the snowfields and alpine regions of NSW, blizzards will descend over areas above 1,700m, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, starting from Wednesday night. There will be a second cold front over the weekend, which will bring more damaging winds. This is expected to affect Thredbo and Perisher \u2013 as well as Nowra, Bowral, Batemans Bay, Katoomba and Lithgow. Victorian police warned of gale force winds and a snow dump of up to 1m in areas including Mount Buller, Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Baw Baw.

      "bodyText": "A federal judge in New York ruled the US Department of Justice can\u2019t replace nine lawyers on the legal team arguing the controversial dispute over whether the administration can add a citizenship question to the 2020 census without explaining why it wants to swap out the lawyers. The justice department announced this week that it was appointing a new team of lawyers to take over census-related cases, after the supreme court upheld a lower court decision rejecting the commerce department\u2019s stated justification for adding a citizenship question to the census. But US district judge Jesse M Furman, who earlier this year ruled against adding the citizenship question, ruled on Tuesday that the justice department provided \u201cno reasons, let alone \u2018satisfactory reasons\u2019, for the substitution of counsel\u201d. The justice department had announced the changes in a three-paragraph notification that argued the replacements wouldn\u2019t \u201ccause any disruption in this matter\u201d. Furman called the department\u2019s request \u201cpatently deficient\u201d, except for two lawyers who have left the department or the civil division which is handling the case. The changes in the legal team came about after a top justice department civil attorney who was leading the litigation effort told the attorney general, William Barr, that multiple people on the team preferred not to continue, Barr told the Associated Press on Monday. The attorney who was leading the team, James Burnham, \u201cindicated it was a logical breaking point since a new decision would be made and the issue going forward would hopefully be separate from the historical debates\u201d, Barr said. Tuesday\u2019s ruling is the latest in the controversy around the citizenship question. Civil rights groups have argued that asking about citizenship status may discourage immigrants from participating in the census, producing an undercount of immigrants, particularly immigrants of color, in official tallies. Following the supreme court\u2019s decision two weeks ago, the commerce department\u2019s Census Bureau began printing census questionnaires without the question and the Department of Justice signaled it would not attempt to continue the legal fight. But the department reversed itself after Donald Trump promised to keep trying to add the question and notified judges in three similar legal challenges that it planned to find a new legal path to adding the question to the census. Furman said the urgency to resolve legal claims and the need for efficient judicial proceedings was an important consideration in rejecting a replacement of lawyers. He said the justice department had insisted that the speedy resolution of lawsuits against adding the question was \u201ca matter of great private and public importance\u201d. \u201cIf anything, that urgency, and the need for efficient judicial proceedings, has only grown since that time,\u201d Furman said. Furman said the government could re-submit its request to replace attorneys only with a sworn statement by each lawyer explaining satisfactory reasons to withdraw so late. He said he\u2019ll require new attorneys to promise personnel changes will not slow the case.",

While there\u2019s no right answer to that question, there is a right way to go about looking for that answer.</p> <p>Step one would be to identify all of the policy areas where big changes might drive significant economic benefits. In addition to reforming the way we currently subsidise carbon pollution instead of taxing it, some obvious areas for \u201cserious\u201d economic reform include:</p> <ul> <li><p>Making childcare more affordable for low- and middle-income working families to boost the number of women in the labour force.</p></li> <li><p>Changing our education system to resemble the structure, and the outcomes, of the systems found in the Nordic countries.</p></li> <li><p>Providing cheap and fast public transport to connect affordable housing to the centres of job creation.</p></li> </ul> <p>I know, I know, that\u2019s a list of social policies not \u201ceconomic reforms\u201d, but step two in any rigorous process to identify economic reform priorities would be to develop a rough estimate of the potential benefits of a policy change.</p> <p>While around 60% of working-age women (15-64) are active in the <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.CACT.FE.ZS\">Australian labour market</a>, in New Zealand the figure is 65%, and in Iceland, the country that regularly tops the list for gender equity, 72% of working-age women are in work.</p> <p>If the Australian labour market and childcare sector was as supportive of women\u2019s choices as Iceland\u2019s are, then our GDP could increase by more than $183bn. How good is that for social policy?</p> <p>Similarly, the cost of our failed experiments with private school subsidies are enormous. The quality of education we provide to Australian children is falling far behind the education kids are getting in Singapore, Canada and Finland. And we are slipping further.</p> <p>It\u2019s as if giving billions of dollars in public money to private schools with <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/pools-with-moveable-floors-the-private-school-arms-race-intensifies-20180405-p4z7xj.html\">indoor pools and orchestra elevators</a> is doing nothing to improve educational standards in Australia. Most economists would agree that targeted investment in education does more to drive long-run economic growth than anything else. But, as with carbon pricing, who cares about what economists actually say when the opinions of the powerful are so freely available? And while it\u2019s true the business lobby groups frequently opine about the need to control government spending, Australia\u2019s business elite are remarkably silent about the billions in public money that have flowed into their own kids\u2019 exclusive schools.</p> <p>Then there is congestion. In our major cities, congestion imposes huge costs on the vast majority of Australia\u2019s workers, their families and businesses. Not only does reducing congestion allow people to save money on housing and transport, it improves the quality of their lives and the productivity of our economy. It too should be main game for those interested in serious reform.</p> <p>But alas, in Australia the business lobby groups, not economists or voters, get to tell us what our economic priorities should be. And in Australia, despite the fact that we are a low-tax country with low rates of union membership, the business community tells us that the \u201cserious issues\u201d we have to urgently address are more tax cuts (that they want), and new attacks on workers (that the unions don\u2019t want).</p> <p>To be clear, there is no \u201cright\u201d tax system and there is no \u201cright\u201d industrial relations system. We should always be open to debating the options. But in what world, after 20 years of cuts to taxes and worker protections, could more tax cutting and losses of worker protection be the number one reform priority?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jul/04/do-you-understand-the-hecs-changes-read-this-and-be-afraid-for-the-entire-economy\">Do you understand the Hecs changes? Read this and be afraid for the entire economy | Naaman Zhou</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last year we were told that cutting penalty rates would be great for the economy. Now, even the small business lobby concedes penalty rate cuts did not create a single job. Such an outcome should come as no surprise, <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/cutting-penalty-rates-was-supposed-to-create-jobs-it-hasnt-and-heres-why-not-117178\">as Professor Martin O\u2019Brien observed</a>: \u201cOf the 151 academic papers the [Fair Work] Commission referred to in its decision, not one contained sound empirical analysis of the employment impact of penalty rates.\u201d</p> <p>Just as we spend billions of dollars subsidising new coalmines and private schools with no complaint from the business lobby groups allegedly concerned with serious economic reform, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/04/income-tax-cuts-battle-heats-up-what-youll-get-if-it-clears-the-hurdle\">we just spent $158bn on tax cuts</a> \u2013 one of the most expensive bills to ever pass through the Australian parliament \u2013 without so much as a Senate inquiry into the consequences.</p> <p>It\u2019s time we reformed the way we talked about reform. The dictionary says reform means \u201cchange for the better\u201d, but in Australian public debate it has simply come to mean \u201cchange demanded by the powerful few\u201d.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt we should reform our tax system, our industrial relations system and the way our government provides a wide range of important services. We could of course choose to emulate the tax and spending policies of Donald Trump or we could learn from the Nordic countries \u2013 which have the strongest economies, the best education systems and the best health systems in the world.</p> <p>If business lobby groups were genuine about the pursuit of serious economic reforms they would present the evidence that shows it is more important to change Australia\u2019s unfair dismissal laws and cut taxes than to make the childcare system more affordable. But they aren\u2019t more important, so the business lobby groups won\u2019t. Powerful groups don\u2019t need evidence. That\u2019s what makes them powerful.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute</p>",

Politics in Australia has become the art of dressing self-interest up as national interest and no one does a better job of feigning concern for mum-and-dad investors and working families than the industry groups that raged against regulations designed to protect small investors and strongly supported cuts to the incomes of working families. So, if the business community were genuine about serious economic reform \u2013 and that is a very big if \u2013 what should they focus on? While there\u2019s no right answer to that question, there is a right way to go about looking for that answer. Step one would be to identify all of the policy areas where big changes might drive significant economic benefits. In addition to reforming the way we currently subsidise carbon pollution instead of taxing it, some obvious areas for \u201cserious\u201d economic reform include: Making childcare more affordable for low- and middle-income working families to boost the number of women in the labour force. Changing our education system to resemble the structure, and the outcomes, of the systems found in the Nordic countries. Providing cheap and fast public transport to connect affordable housing to the centres of job creation. I know, I know, that\u2019s a list of social policies not \u201ceconomic reforms\u201d, but step two in any rigorous process to identify economic reform priorities would be to develop a rough estimate of the potential benefits of a policy change. While around 60% of working-age women (15-64) are active in the Australian labour market, in New Zealand the figure is 65%, and in Iceland, the country that regularly tops the list for gender equity, 72% of working-age women are in work. If the Australian labour market and childcare sector was as supportive of women\u2019s choices as Iceland\u2019s are, then our GDP could increase by more than $183bn. How good is that for social policy? Similarly, the cost of our failed experiments with private school subsidies are enormous. The quality of education we provide to Australian children is falling far behind the education kids are getting in Singapore, Canada and Finland. And we are slipping further. It\u2019s as if giving billions of dollars in public money to private schools with indoor pools and orchestra elevators is doing nothing to improve educational standards in Australia. Most economists would agree that targeted investment in education does more to drive long-run economic growth than anything else. But, as with carbon pricing, who cares about what economists actually say when the opinions of the powerful are so freely available? And while it\u2019s true the business lobby groups frequently opine about the need to control government spending, Australia\u2019s business elite are remarkably silent about the billions in public money that have flowed into their own kids\u2019 exclusive schools. Then there is congestion. In our major cities, congestion imposes huge costs on the vast majority of Australia\u2019s workers, their families and businesses. Not only does reducing congestion allow people to save money on housing and transport, it improves the quality of their lives and the productivity of our economy. It too should be main game for those interested in serious reform. But alas, in Australia the business lobby groups, not economists or voters, get to tell us what our economic priorities should be. And in Australia, despite the fact that we are a low-tax country with low rates of union membership, the business community tells us that the \u201cserious issues\u201d we have to urgently address are more tax cuts (that they want), and new attacks on workers (that the unions don\u2019t want). To be clear, there is no \u201cright\u201d tax system and there is no \u201cright\u201d industrial relations system. We should always be open to debating the options. But in what world, after 20 years of cuts to taxes and worker protections, could more tax cutting and losses of worker protection be the number one reform priority? Last year we were told that cutting penalty rates would be great for the economy. Now, even the small business lobby concedes penalty rate cuts did not create a single job. Such an outcome should come as no surprise, as Professor Martin O\u2019Brien observed: \u201cOf the 151 academic papers the [Fair Work] Commission referred to in its decision, not one contained sound empirical analysis of the employment impact of penalty rates.\u201d Just as we spend billions of dollars subsidising new coalmines and private schools with no complaint from the business lobby groups allegedly concerned with serious economic reform, we just spent $158bn on tax cuts \u2013 one of the most expensive bills to ever pass through the Australian parliament \u2013 without so much as a Senate inquiry into the consequences. It\u2019s time we reformed the way we talked about reform. The dictionary says reform means \u201cchange for the better\u201d, but in Australian public debate it has simply come to mean \u201cchange demanded by the powerful few\u201d. There\u2019s no doubt we should reform our tax system, our industrial relations system and the way our government provides a wide range of important services. We could of course choose to emulate the tax and spending policies of Donald Trump or we could learn from the Nordic countries \u2013 which have the strongest economies, the best education systems and the best health systems in the world. If business lobby groups were genuine about the pursuit of serious economic reforms they would present the evidence that shows it is more important to change Australia\u2019s unfair dismissal laws and cut taxes than to make the childcare system more affordable. But they aren\u2019t more important, so the business lobby groups won\u2019t. Powerful groups don\u2019t need evidence. That\u2019s what makes them powerful. \u2022 Richard Denniss is chief economist at the Australia Institute",

A pre-existing condition (PEC) is defined as any illness, ailment, or condition for which signs or symptoms existed six months before a claimant took out insurance. Those with pre-existing conditions must wait 12 months before making a related claim for hospital cover. Without such a requirement, customers who get sick or foresee the need for hospital treatment could simply take out a policy, immediately make a claim, and then end or downgrade their policy once the hospital treatment ends. This effectively forces other policy-holders to cover the obvious costs incurred by the insurer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What must insurers do before rejecting a claim due to a pre-existing medical condition? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The law requires insurers appoint a medical practitioner to review claims before they are rejected on PEC grounds. The doctor, paid by the insurer, reviews the medical evidence and considers advice from the customer\u2019s treating physician. The insurer\u2019s doctor must be satisfied that there is a direct link between the sickness or injury that is the subject of the claim, and the signs or symptoms that existed in the six months prior to taking out insurance.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What can the commonwealth ombudsman do to investigate complaints? </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The commonwealth ombudsman acts as the public watchdog of private health insurers. It responds to individual complaints about a range of insurer conduct, including costs, service and the quality of advice. The ombudsman has a small team dedicated to private health insurance matters, which previously operated as a standalone agency, the private health insurance ombudsman. The team gets through a huge volume of work. It investigates thousands of complaints against private health insurers each year, and the numbers have almost doubled in the past decade. In 2017-18 alone, the ombudsman investigated 4,553 complaints against health insurers, 367 of which were related to pre-existing conditions. When someone complains about a pre-existing condition rejection, the ombudsman asks the customer for medical certificates from their treating physician, and requests the insurer provide its own doctor\u2019s assessment and the outcome letter sent to the customer. A case officer weighs up the evidence and can resolve it themselves, seek the advice of colleagues or superiors, or escalate the complaint up to senior management.&nbsp;<br><br>Where it suspects the insurer was wrong, the ombudsman can seek a review by an independent medical advisor. If the independent advice also finds wrongdoing, the ombudsman writes to the insurer and asks them to reconsider its decision.<br><br>Where more systemic failings are detected, like those at Bupa and NIB, the ombudsman can either warn the insurer directly or refer the matter to the Department of Health, which acts as the regulator.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Public complaints against private health insurers are primarily handled by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, which has limited powers and resourcing to tackle insurers.</p> \n<p>In 2017-18 alone, the ombudsman investigated 367 complaints about insurers\u2019 handling of pre-existing conditions.</p> \n<p>The ombudsman can refer serious, systemic failings to the Department of Health, which acts as the regulator.</p> \n<p>Wells said the conduct of the insurers underscored the need for a \u201cstrengthened role for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to monitor health insurance activities\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cConsumers have every reason to expect that the funds to whom they pay thousands of dollars in premiums are behaving with the utmost integrity,\u201d she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jan/31/nearly-half-of-australians-dont-think-private-health-insurance-is-essential\">Nearly half of Australians don't think private health insurance is 'essential'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Labor\u2019s shadow health minister, Chris Bowen, said costs and waiting lists for health services were already high, and improperly rejecting patients for hospital cover would \u201conly add to the access crisis\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSeemingly systemic problems such as this is one of the reasons we proposed a Productivity Commission Inquiry before the election,\u201d Bowen said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe government should stop sitting on its hands and take real action to ensure private health insurance customers are getting better value for money than they have been.\u201d</p> \n<p>A spokesman for the health minister, Greg Hunt, said any reports of improper private health insurance practices were taken seriously.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Department of Health advises that NIB has provided information about its processes to resolve outstanding pre-existing condition assessment issues with its affected customers,\u201d the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>The government had also strengthened the powers of the ombudsman earlier this year, the spokesman said.</p> \n<p>\u201cAs part of a broader package of reforms to make private health insurance simpler and more affordable implemented in early 2019, the government has strengthened the powers of the private health insurance ombudsman to enable to them to better resolve complaints made by the public.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pre-existing conditions are illnesses or injuries for which symptoms were seen six months before a person took out health insurance.

High court judges would use the constitution as the basis for some of their decisions, many of their decisions, and the simple intent could be a complex challenge, or an issue for Australia.</p> <p>\u201cThe Mabo decision was brilliant, but nobody ever thought the whole concept of terra nullis would have been overturned like it was. It is our rule book and it is an important rule book.\u201d</p> <p>But finding the right phrasing is not the only challenge facing Wyatt and Burney. Of the 44 referendums held in Australia since 1901, just eight have been successful.</p> <p>Wyatt said having both the government and the opposition in accord gave any future referendum on Indigenous recognition a better chance. But he believes true success lies in finding the consensus \u201cthat our people agree to, that the majority of Australians will accept and the majority of states and territories\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a high hurdle to have to leap over but it is one that protects our democracy,\u201d he said.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/28/we-want-referendum-intensive-uluru-talks-call-for-an-end-to-the-fighting\">In May 2017, a gathering of 300 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people signed the Uluru statement from the heart </a>and presented it to the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and former opposition leader, Bill Shorten, proposing a constitutionally enshrined First Nations representative body to advise parliament on policy which affected Indigenous peoples.</p> <p>It also called on a commitment to \u201ctruth telling\u201d of Australia\u2019s colonial history through the establishment of a Makarrata commission.</p> <p>Last year <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/sep/26/scott-morrison-claims-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-would-be-a-third-chamber\">Scott Morrison rejected the voice to parliament proposal,</a> claiming it would constitute a third chamber, continuing a criticism Turnbull had used. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/oct/26/turnbulls-uluru-statement-rejection-mean-spirited-bastardry-legal-expert\">Indigenous and legal experts have rejected that characterisation</a>, pointing out a voice to parliament would not have any veto powers, nor would it examine every piece of legislation. The debate stalled any progress on Indigenous recognition.</p> <p>Labor senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/pat-dodson\">Pat Dodson</a>, known by many as the \u201cfather of reconciliation\u201d, told ABC radio <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/05/pat-dodson-urges-coalition-to-deal-with-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-and-referendum\">it had been more than two years since the Uluru statement from the heart was delivered to parliamentary leaders </a>and it was time to start moving.</p> <p>\u201cI think these are matters which have dragged on for far too long, and certainly the other aspect, which is the Markarrata commission of treaty making, is being lost in the course of the discussions here.</p> <p>\u201cPeople should really put the challenge to the minister, come up with the model that they want, the voice, and the set of words that they want to go into the constitution, and there has been proposals in relation to those matters and it shouldn\u2019t take more than 18 months to settle that.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/05/pat-dodson-urges-coalition-to-deal-with-indigenous-voice-to-parliament-and-referendum\">Pat Dodson urges Coalition to 'deal with' Indigenous voice to parliament and referendum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Dodson also said he believed a treaty was crucial. Australia remains the only Commonwealth nation not to have signed a treaty with its Indigenous peoples.</p> <p>\u201cPeople have asked for certainty, they want the tyranny of their powerlessness, I think is part of the Uluru statement and they want to remove powerlessness from their interface with the government.</p> <p>\u201cNow just having a legislative entity doesn\u2019t do that. You have to deal with the more substantial matters, the cause for the dispossession, and for the loss of culture and the loss of uniqueness of First Nations peoples. And the consequences of policies that have been perpetrated upon us over many years. That only comes through agreements.\u201d</p> <p>Wyatt said any future proposal would need to consider the Uluru statement from the heart.</p> <p>\u201cIt has to, because, when I take the notion of the voice, that voice was not just a singular voice, it was voices from every level,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI hear it frequently, even when I was in [the former portfolio of] aged care and I was out in Aboriginal communities talking about aged care. People were saying we need to have our voices heard.</p> <p>\u201cAnd it is a generic term that we have used, ever since I can remember in all of my activism since I was young, even through to now. I still hear people say we need a voice, so we can be heard.\u201d</p> <p>Wyatt said he was believed most Australians \u201cwant to right wrongs\u201d, but said if he had colleagues who were opposed to the idea, he would respect their position on it. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has already criticised the process, claiming that as a white person born in Australia, she is \u201cIndigenous\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI had someone say to me \u2018why should we make mention of a particular group in the constitution?\u2019 What they overlook is that section 127 referred to natives not being counted. Section 5,126 talks about Indigenous Australians, so we have been in there right from the beginning, certainly in section 127. So we are not creating a precedent.</p> <p>\u201cThe precedent was already set when the founding fathers wrote the constitution.\u201d</p>",

In his first speech to the National Press Club since taking over the portfolio later on Wednesday, Wyatt will expand on the plan to present a set of words for a referendum to the nation. \u201cWe need consensus, but we need the right set of words,\u201d Wyatt told ABC radio. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t realise is whatever words you insert into the constitution, they can have significant implications way beyond the simple wording. High court judges would use the constitution as the basis for some of their decisions, many of their decisions, and the simple intent could be a complex challenge, or an issue for Australia. \u201cThe Mabo decision was brilliant, but nobody ever thought the whole concept of terra nullis would have been overturned like it was. It is our rule book and it is an important rule book.\u201d But finding the right phrasing is not the only challenge facing Wyatt and Burney. Of the 44 referendums held in Australia since 1901, just eight have been successful. Wyatt said having both the government and the opposition in accord gave any future referendum on Indigenous recognition a better chance. But he believes true success lies in finding the consensus \u201cthat our people agree to, that the majority of Australians will accept and the majority of states and territories\u201d. \u201cIt is a high hurdle to have to leap over but it is one that protects our democracy,\u201d he said. In May 2017, a gathering of 300 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people signed the Uluru statement from the heart and presented it to the then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull and former opposition leader, Bill Shorten, proposing a constitutionally enshrined First Nations representative body to advise parliament on policy which affected Indigenous peoples. It also called on a commitment to \u201ctruth telling\u201d of Australia\u2019s colonial history through the establishment of a Makarrata commission. Last year Scott Morrison rejected the voice to parliament proposal, claiming it would constitute a third chamber, continuing a criticism Turnbull had used. Indigenous and legal experts have rejected that characterisation, pointing out a voice to parliament would not have any veto powers, nor would it examine every piece of legislation. The debate stalled any progress on Indigenous recognition. Labor senator Pat Dodson, known by many as the \u201cfather of reconciliation\u201d, told ABC radio it had been more than two years since the Uluru statement from the heart was delivered to parliamentary leaders and it was time to start moving. \u201cI think these are matters which have dragged on for far too long, and certainly the other aspect, which is the Markarrata commission of treaty making, is being lost in the course of the discussions here. \u201cPeople should really put the challenge to the minister, come up with the model that they want, the voice, and the set of words that they want to go into the constitution, and there has been proposals in relation to those matters and it shouldn\u2019t take more than 18 months to settle that.\u201d Dodson also said he believed a treaty was crucial. Australia remains the only Commonwealth nation not to have signed a treaty with its Indigenous peoples. \u201cPeople have asked for certainty, they want the tyranny of their powerlessness, I think is part of the Uluru statement and they want to remove powerlessness from their interface with the government. \u201cNow just having a legislative entity doesn\u2019t do that. You have to deal with the more substantial matters, the cause for the dispossession, and for the loss of culture and the loss of uniqueness of First Nations peoples. And the consequences of policies that have been perpetrated upon us over many years. That only comes through agreements.\u201d Wyatt said any future proposal would need to consider the Uluru statement from the heart. \u201cIt has to, because, when I take the notion of the voice, that voice was not just a singular voice, it was voices from every level,\u201d he said. \u201cI hear it frequently, even when I was in [the former portfolio of] aged care and I was out in Aboriginal communities talking about aged care. People were saying we need to have our voices heard. \u201cAnd it is a generic term that we have used, ever since I can remember in all of my activism since I was young, even through to now. I still hear people say we need a voice, so we can be heard.\u201d Wyatt said he was believed most Australians \u201cwant to right wrongs\u201d, but said if he had colleagues who were opposed to the idea, he would respect their position on it. One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has already criticised the process, claiming that as a white person born in Australia, she is \u201cIndigenous\u201d. \u201cI had someone say to me \u2018why should we make mention of a particular group in the constitution?\u2019 What they overlook is that section 127 referred to natives not being counted. Section 5,126 talks about Indigenous Australians, so we have been in there right from the beginning, certainly in section 127. So we are not creating a precedent. \u201cThe precedent was already set when the founding fathers wrote the constitution.\u201d",
